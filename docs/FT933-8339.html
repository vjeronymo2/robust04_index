			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Kiev moves to resolve its nuclear limbo: Fears grow that Ukraine will soon be able to fire the weapons on its territory THE US and other western countries are watching Ukraine anxiously to see whether Russia's sister Slav state will soon be a formidable nuclear power. Ukraine inhabits a sort of nuclear limbo. Such a large chunk of the former Soviet nuclear arsenal - 1,656 nuclear war-heads - is stationed on Ukrainian territory that if Kiev were to develop operational control over all of them it would be the third most powerful nuclear nation behind the US and Russia. Western fears - and Russian ones - grew last month, when the Ukrainian parliament declared that independent Ukraine owned all the nuclear weapons stationed on its territory. However, as General Pavel Grachev, the Russian minister of defence pointed out last week, all nuclear weapons stationed in Ukraine are under the operational control of Russia. The question troubling western foreign ministries is: should Ukraine want 'operational control' over those weapons (meaning the ability to fire them), how easy would it be for Kiev to develop it? The Ukrainian parliament has hesitated over ratifying international disarmament treaties which would commit Ukraine to becoming a non-nuclear state. President Leonid Kravchuk has said that he favours a compromise agreement in which Ukraine would pledge eventually to become a non-nuclear power but would temporarily keep some Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles on its territory. 'The Ukrainians are hedging their bets on the nuclear question because they want some time in which they can keep their eyes on the Russians,' says Mr Bruce Blair, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and one of the leading American experts on Soviet nuclear weapons. Ukrainian scientists, engineers and military men played a crucial role in the building of the former Soviet Union's vast nuclear arsenal, and according to Mr Blair, there is no doubt that if they put their minds to it, they could develop independent nuclear capacity. Mr Markian Bilinsky, a British academic working at a Ukrainian research institute, goes further. 'The Ukrainians are moving closer to obtaining operational control. I cannot believe that there is not some institute in Ukraine which is working on breaking the codes for the missiles,' he says. This spring, American and Russian intelligence sources leaked their fears that Ukraine had begun to try to develop control over the 1,656 strategic nuclear weapons currently under Russian control, but located on Ukrainian territory. Their worries centred on the factory in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkov. This closely guarded enterprise, which officially bears the innocuous title TS Shevchenko Factory in honour of Ukraine's national poet, is one of only two plants in the former Soviet Union which manufactured blocking devices for ICBMs. Ukraine has a legitimate reason for building blocking devices of its own: Moscow's breach of its promise to provide Kiev with technical 'negative control' - the physical ability to veto the use of the nuclear weapons on its territory. However, as Mr Blair explained in testimony before a Senate committee, 'the devices unfortunately do more than just block unauthorised launches; they are also integral to the launch process. If Ukraine replaced the current devices with their own they would be able to activate the flight plans on the missiles and fire them.' However, any tampering with the weapons would be immediately detected by Moscow. Russian Strategic Rocket Force commanders could then respond in a number of ways, ranging from employing various built-in safety devices which would temporarily de-activate the missiles, to a pre-emptive military strike. The missiles most suited to Ukraine's defence needs are the 130 SS-19s stationed in Ukraine. The SS-19s have been routinely tested at a little more than 600 miles, their minimum distance, and, as it happens, the distance between Ukrainian airfields and Moscow. Moreover, as Mr Yakov Eisenberg, director of the Khartron weapons systems factory in eastern Ukraine proudly confirms, the guidance system for the SS-19s were entirely designed and are maintained by his scientists. However, acquiring control over the SS-19s could be of dubious value for Ukraine because 18 months ago Russia stopped maintaining the tritium in their war-heads. Mr Blair reckons that some of the missiles could be as much as three years overdue for maintenance and, consequently, might not go off if they were fired. In addition to the SS-19s, there are 46 SS-24s located on Ukrainian territory. However, controlling the SS-24s, whose shortest range in test history is 1,700 miles, would not enable Ukraine to threaten European Russia, which Ukraine perceives as the source of its most serious security threat. Ukraine also possesses 30 strategic bombers, stationed at the Uzin air-base, just south of Kiev, and believed to carry a total of 416 bombs, including cruise missiles. Western diplomats in the former Soviet Union think these bombers, more modest in their capacity to wreak mass destruction, could represent Ukraine's quickest and most effective route to nuclear capacity. In contrast with the ICBMs, which, despite the Ukrainian ministry of defence's best efforts, are still guarded by soldiers loyal to Moscow, the bomber pilots publicly took an oath of allegiance to Kiev early in Ukraine's drive for independence. However, as Mr Blair points out, the bombs are stored separately from the bombers and he believes that the officers commanding that base, though not the soldiers, are still loyal to Moscow. In a guarded room in one of Kharkov's sophisticated design bureaus, Ukrainian scientists may well be investigating these technical avenues. But whether they actually use their skills will be determined by the Ukrainian government and its anxious relationship with Russia.</p>

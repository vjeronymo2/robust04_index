			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Andras Agoston, chairman of the Democratic </F> Union of Vojvodina Hungarians, by Imre Sebestyen; place and date  not given: "The VMDK Does Not Deal With the Issue of Border  Modification"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Sebestyen] What is your  opinion of the division within the leadership of the Democratic  Union of Vojvodina Hungarians [VMDK] and the confrontation?    [Agoston] There have been different views within the VMDK  from the very beginning. VMDK Deputy Chairman Sandor Hodi's  political position has been the same from the very beginning:  He starts from the premise that a new settlement will take  place in this part of Europe and that a border modification is a  realistic possibility within this new settlement. Thus, for  him, the implementation of the autonomy concept is the minimum  that the Serbian leadership should give us because the organized  political opposition of the Vojvodina Hungarians and the  international support the Hungarians receive in this forces the  Serbs to do that. Dialogue and the daily political cooperation  of coexisting people are not a necessary part of that concept.  It does not count on the principle of partnership based on  political subjectivity; instead, it counts on the fact that, as  a result of favorable international circumstances, the Serbs  will get into a subordinate position. Naturally, that political  philosophy only covers the block Hungarians. Given the fact  that it circumvents the issue of coexistence of people living in  this area -- first of all the coexistence of Serbs and  Hungarians -- the concept is abstract and unrealistic. As  opposed to that -- and in my opinion this political philosophy  still has greater support within the VMDK -- another line  emerges as more realistic. The essence of it is that in the  current situation, the issue of border modification should not  be included in the political activity of the VMDK. We do not  want to live in subjugation, but we know that we have to live in  peace with the others in this region, first of all with the  Serbs. The Hungarians here must be guaranteed a constitutional  and legal framework in which they can preserve their identity,  survive, and remain here without a border modification. This  legal framework is the autonomy concept of the VMDK. The  legality and democratic support make it possible for the VMDK to  act as a political partner in settling the common affairs of the  Hungarians living in the Carpathina basin. Our common goal is  to make sure that Hungary becomes a member of the European Union  as soon as possible and that the Hungarians living beyond  Hungary's borders can implement their autonomy efforts. The  results achieved so far prove that there is no politically  relevant alternative to that idea. On the other side, of  course, there is the danger that the so-called reformer  politicians who are also increasingly forced into the background  within the VMDK might gain ground. The essence of their efforts  is that they are ready to give up not only the independence and  political legality of the VMDK but also Hungarian autonomy in  exchange for Serbian concessions adequate to their individual or  group interests.

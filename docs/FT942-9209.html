			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / UK Company News: TR Europe raises Pounds 38m via placing TR European Growth has raised Pounds 38m of new capital with a conversion share issue. The trust, which invests in smaller companies, was previously capitalised at just under Pounds 63m. The bulk of the new money - Pounds 34.2m - was raised from an institutional placing, while Pounds 3.9m came from an offer for subscription. The C-share offer had been set at a maximum Pounds 60m, but difficult market conditions during the offer period meant that the target was unlikely to be achieved. The shares will converted into new ordinary shares by August 31, or when 80 per cent of the new funds have been invested.</p>

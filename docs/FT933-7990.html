			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Bucknall recovery under way as deficit is cut to Pounds 1.33m BUCKNALL GROUP, the quantity surveying, property and project management company, reduced pre-tax losses by 31 per cent in the year to April 30. Mr Richard Miles, chairman, expects 'a return to profitability in the not too distant future.' The pre-tax deficit was Pounds 1.33m, reduced from Pounds 1.92m last time. Losses per share were 10.5p (13p). No dividend is proposed. The lower losses and the prospect of a return to profit owe more to cost reductions than to demand in the construction and property markets where the group is taking work on margins which, said Mr Miles, 'are hovering around the break-even.' Turnover from continuing operations was Pounds 16m, fractionally lower than the year before. The UK accounts for about 75 per cent of the group's business and domestic operations came back into profit during the second half. Bucknall is trading profitably in Germany, Hong Kong and the Middle East; but cancelled projects forced retrenchment in France and the cost of this was the main factor dragging on finances last year, just as similar experiences in the UK pulled down the previous year's figures. Behind expectations of a return to profitability is the absence of sizeable restruct-uring costs in the current year. 'We are confident that the worst is over for the group,' Mr Miles said.</p>

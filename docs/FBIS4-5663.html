			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO -- New party Sakigake, led by  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, will remain in the  ruling coalition, a senior party official said Wednesday [13  April].    There may remain "an unpleasant feeling" between Sakigake  and  Shinseito, however, said the official, who spoke to reporters on  condition of anonymity. Shinseito is regarded as the most  influential force in the seven-party coalition.    Shinseito head Tsutomu Hata, who is deputy prime minister  and  foreign minister, has emerged as the most likely successor to  outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, coalition sources  said.    During the course of the power struggle following Hosokawa's  announcement of his resignation last Friday, Sakigake has sided  with the coalition's biggest group, the Social Democratic Party,  to oppose Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa's influence  over the choice of a successor to Hosokawa, political sources  said.</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / TGWU to probe fraud allegations The Transport and General Workers' Union has launched an inquiry into the running of its north-west England region after allegations of fraud and wrongful financial accounting in its Merseyside divisional office. Mr Bill Morris, TGWU general secretary, said yesterday that 'major fraud' had been discovered and the TGWU was taking action to see that it did not happen again. He added that the union had decided not to call in the police. The union's executive has agreed to set up a four-man inquiry to decide what can be done to prevent a repetition of the alleged abuses. The decision comes in the wake of a report by Mr Albert Blyghton, the union's legal secretary, following complaints and allegations made against TGWU officials on Merseyside. Two of three officials named in the report have already accepted disciplinary action and the other has resigned. The TGWU general secretary gave the executive a full report of Mr Blyghton's findings, which conclude that there is 'clear evidence that a major fraud has been committed against the union and its members in the Merseyside divisional office, for at least six years.' The charges include the alleged misuse of members' strike pay by officials, irregularities in the running of executive council elections and misuse of finance during recruitment campaigns. Members told the inquiry in written statements that they had not received strike pay from the union when involved in five separate disputes on Merseyside. Other, unknown, people had signed receipts for the money in their names. The union's auditors had been unable to confirm where the money had gone. Mr Blyghton found 'some evidence of financial irregularities' in the activities of membership recruitment teams organised from the TGWU's Merseyside divisional office. It is also alleged that money was misappropriated in a scheme under which a company supplying illuminated advertising for taxis paid money to the TGWU on Merseyside to have its signs carried by the union's taxi-driver membership in the area. Under the deal Cab Tops, the company, paid the TGWU 'an agreed sum'. The union would then deduct union contributions and administration charges and pass the balance to the cab drivers. Mr Morris said: 'The management of the finances of this scheme were most irregular. Money paid to the TGWU by Cab Tops was passed through the Merseyside account into a private building society account'. It is alleged that a union official who was sole signatory of that account, 'wrote cheques to himself for sums around Pounds 300 and would draw the money in cash'. Mr Blyghton also found alleged evidence of financial irregularities in the use of the union's education budget. There had been no fraud, but 'it was an example of deliberate wrongful accounting', the report said.</p>

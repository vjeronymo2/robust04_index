			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- North Korea's possible  withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)  depends on moves taken by the United States, a senior official  of Pyongyang's ruling party was quoted as saying Wednesday.    Kim Yong-gon [name as received], deputy head of the Korean  Workers Party's International Department, brushed aside  allegations of North Korea's nuclear arms development during a  meeting in Pyongyang with two visiting House of Representatives  members of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP),  LDP officials said. Kim called the alleged nuclear arms  development a fabrication and a plot aimed at isolating North  Korea from the international community, the officials said,  quoting reports received from the two, including former Defense  Agency Chief Taku Yamasaki.    In response to the LDP members' call for North Korea to stay  in the NPT regime, Kim said its withdrawal "depends on what  action the U.S. will take," the officials said. He also said  Pyongyang "will counter dialogue with dialogue, sanctions with  reprisals, and war with war," they added.</p>

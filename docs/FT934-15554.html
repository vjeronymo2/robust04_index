			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (1): Companies face tough decisions - The driving force behind much of the business location activity across Europe arises from the need to consolidate manufacturing, distribution and management functions, and to adjust to a wider European market of 400 million people WHILE the politicians agonise over the future shape and direction of Europe, the commercial community which makes up one of the world's most powerful economies has to get on with its business. The luxury of long-term summitry is for others; winning the next order is top of the daily agenda. But as corporate Europe clocks on, it is increasingly obliged to take note of far-reaching structural changes, proposed and underway, in the political and economic landscape. Companies' future success or failure will depend on the strength of their strategic skills and how they deploy them to best exploit a western and central European market of 400m people. Nor will the game of winning in Europe only be played by the huge multinational corporations who are well used to adapting, chameleon-like, to local circumstances; more modest-sized businesses will have to raise their sights to wider, European horizons. Even without the prospect of an enlarged community, the parameters for doing business are already changing. The recent creation - by the EC and the seven member states of the European Free Trade Association - of the European Economic Area establishes the world's largest free trade market. Central and eastern European markets, despite the immense difficulties confronting businesses intent upon capitalising on the new freedoms of former communist states, add yet another dimension to the marketplace. Small wonder that there is a growing tendency for companies to abandon the notion of the nation state and to think in European terms for their markets and regionally for their manufacturing, distribution and management facilities. Still less surprising that companies from the world's most important trading nations, like the US and Japan, remain keen to increase their presence and participation in Europe, even if their efforts are temporarily subdued by liquidity pressures and recession. The big inward investors are maintaining extensive inward investment programmes, but the decision-making process is being stretched and in such uncertain economic times there is a growing reluctance to push the button. Much has also been made of the threat to Europe posed by the economic power-house fast emerging along the Pacific rim, with a ferocious rate of high-technology investment being notched up in places like Taiwan and South Korea. The US might also be increasingly attracted to markets on its own doorstep once it signs a North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. But does that mean that Europe's best days for attracting global business are over? 'The idea that Europe as a location for corporate investment is somehow 'over the top' is ridiculous,' according to Dr Wilfried Vossen, managing director of Plant Location International, the location specialists. 'Europe is and will remain a huge market, with high education and skills levels and enormous consumer power. But it is certainly going to have to adapt if it is not to lose the international battle for investment. 'Europe is becoming a very expensive alternative to other investment locations and it is going to have to tackle many sacred cows, not least high social costs which can no longer be afforded and which make it very hard to create employment,' adds Dr Vossen. Such comments find a warm reception among critics of the EC social chapter in the UK, which has refused to sign up. The Institute of Directors recently described EC social legislation as a 'misdirected and damaging job-destroying machine'; and the British government is now calling on EC members to reform their social security systems in order to cut the rising cost of employment. Germany's most recent experience would tend to support the theory. According to Mr David Rees, head of location advisory service at Ernst &amp; Young: 'There is now a flow of outward investment from German companies into other parts of the community as they migrate away from their own high costs'. German investment in the UK now ranks second behind the United States, with 51 investment decisions - involving 16,000 jobs - recorded in the year to April 1993 by the Invest in Britain Bureau. THE UK has a lot at stake, given its record as the most successful European nation in the fight to attract inward investment. In the last decade, the UK is calculated to have taken nearly 40 per cent of all non-EC investment made in Europe. The country also accommodates about 30 per cent of all the Japanese manufacturing plants which have moved into the EC. Past achievement, even so, is no guarantee of future success and now competition for foreign investment is intense, with France and Spain, for example, giving priority to attracting their share of available funds. With the first wave of large, green field investment over, there may also be a temptation among many companies to spread risk by selecting a separate location for second generation projects. The type of investment may also change, with fewer green field developments and more attention paid to expanding or modernising existing facilities. The driving factor behind much of the location activity now underway across Europe emanates from the search for economies of scale and the need to rationalise structures established when European markets were more fragmented - 'the rate of consolidation under way is dramatic,' according to Dr Vossen of PLI. 'Companies are taking a long, hard look at manufacturing, distribution and managerial functions at European, national and company levels. 'It is not proving an easy task. We are talking about kingdoms being dismantled and everyone fighting to protect their own patches'. One inevitable, less welcome aspect of consolidation is plant closure and some international companies have notably failed to underestimate the problems and costs of shut-down, a process often subject to stringent national laws. The image of footloose multinational conglomerates roaming Europe in search of short-term advantage is largely unfounded but Hoover's decision earlier this year to close its Dijon plant in France and locate all its vacuum cleaner production in Scotland provoked uproar. More recently, the tables were reversed when CPC (UK) decided to move production of its Knorr brand soups and cubes from Scotland, where it has been based for 30 years, to France and Italy. But how does a company decide where to go, when there are so many options and when mistakes can prove so costly? Though Europe may present itself increasingly as a region which is interdependent and heading for economic convergence, it remains a widely diverse trading area, scattered with languages, differing employment laws and taxation regimes. Market accessibility continues to be the principal driving factor behind choice of site but then peripheral locations may offer factors like lower labour costs and better quality of life. The availability of financial incentives for inward investors, which vary considerably throughout the EC, is also emerging as an increasingly important factor, given the pressing need to limit cost. Not too long ago, the question of incentives came into the latter stages of the decision-making process; hard times dictate that more companies are now anxious to know from the outset where the best cash hand-outs are available.

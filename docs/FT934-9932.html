			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Computers in Finance (11): Aid to better decisions  -Benefits of artificial intelligence and knowledge-based systems JUNK MAIL is a contemporary curse. It afflicts anyone whose address qualifies for a marketing database, and that appears to include most of the adult population. As they bin endless leaflets, few people can sympathise with mailshot senders. Some companies, like the Sun Alliance financial services group, are seriously concerned to get right letter through the appropriate box. Sun Alliance is a member of the Department of Trade and Industry's Technology Transfer Club. With a budget of Pounds 5.75m, the club nurtures advanced technology, bringing together users and industry players such as systems house Logica. Sun Alliance has volunteered to test-drive Autonet Workbench, a smart program developed by Recognition Research, in collaboration with Logica. Autonet is an example of neural computing, a branch of software development where the computer is programmed to follow patterns and produce a result that is consistent with previous examples. It could be said to learn by these examples. Unfortunately the language of advanced software can be very deceptive. Neural computing was christened after the thought processes of the human brain. But no program can really replicate the complexity of thought. The most advanced systems still learn by rote, and are limited by the data fed in to them. Sun aims to improve the response rate from mailings, and in the course of that, reduce the amount of junk mail emanating from its financial services operation. The name of the game is spotting the correlation between information about customers and products they have bought in the past. 'We only want to mail information to the customer who'll buy our financial products,' says Steve Lamb, systems manager at Sun. Before Autonet was introduced, standard statistical techniques were used. If this program produces a one per cent improvement in sales, then the technology will have made a significant difference. Mr Lamb is adamant that Sun Alliance's venture into neural computing is no gimmick. His department has spent time assessing pure technology, but that is in the past. 'We did all the 'pie in the sky' stuff two years ago. We want to get some money out of this and we wouldn't be setting it up if we didn't think neural computing would become a standard part of our technology,' he says. Sun Alliance is already examining possible uses of neural computing for claims analysis. Encouraged by official backing and the prospect of real gains, it is willing to take ideas out of the laboratory and into practice. But neural computing grew out of the murky field of artificial intelligence (AI). Such terminology invited inaccurate comparisons with the users' own mind and AI acquired a mixed reputation. This legacy puts prospective customers on their guard. Mercantile &amp; General is the largest specialist reinsurer in the UK underwriting Pounds 1bn worth of life and general premiums per year. Jim Dawson, information services manager, has used software from Neuron Data to devise Magnum, a program that takes the abstract knowledge of the insurance underwriter out into the field with the insurance salesman. 'The problem with life underwriting is that it requires a great deal of expertise. To discriminate between good and bad risks needs an underwriter's judgement.' Underwriting data has traditionally been stored in bulky manuals detailing the risks associated with occupations or sports or medical histories. The underwriter added a considered judgement to this cold data. Neuron Data's Nexpert software provided Jim Dawson with the appropriate guidelines to transform this mix of daunting statistics and professional nous into a practical program. The end result fits on to a laptop computer - 'we put all this data and the judgemental expertise together. Then we integrated it with a salesman's toolkit and let him take that experience out on the road,' he says. Each Nexpert licence costs Pounds 5,000, but the real development costs lay in recruiting and retaining the right programmers. Specialists do not come cheap - getting the Magnum package out on the PCs used by Mercantile and General's insurance clients cost upwards of Pounds 200,000. The key to implementing such a system lies in 'diehard experts,' as Jim Dawson sees them, 'the people who are able to get to grips with the more arcane parts of program development.' He is refreshingly candid in his references to the dramatic language that suppliers wrap around these smart software tools - 'tags like 'artificial intelligence' are too exotic and usually overstate the capabilities of a product. We use the term 'knowledge-based systems' or KBS. It's more meaningful.' Barclays Bank has turned to KBS in an effort to make its commerical lending more consistent. Lending Advisor, a KBS that started life on large IBM mainframes, is under trial at 30 Barclays branches. Developed by Syntelligence at the behest of US banks in the 1980s, Lending Advisor merges historical data about the client with judgements about the viability of the loan. The loan is then classified into one of seven categories, ranging from unacceptable to excellent. Lending Advisor does not come cheap. Licences start at Pounds 600,000. But Mr Rob Turner, European business manager at Syntelligence points out that big provisions for bad debts have made it critical for banks to disseminate lending expertise widely. 'Commercial lending is a problem. We're providing a security blanket,' he says. Whether or not the customer qualifies for a commercial loan is still a decision taken by the bank. Clever software can only reflect the wisdom, or otherwise, of the user. But products like Lending Advisor do promise to iron out seemingly eccentric loan decisions.</p>

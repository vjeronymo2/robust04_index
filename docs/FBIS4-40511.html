			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Serhiy Pavliv] </F>   [Text] The second session of the opposition parliament,  the Crimean Civil Council [HRK], took place in Simferopol on 5  June. The Secretariat summed up the work carried out to organize  the session. After that, its members reviewed events occurring  over the two weeks since the last session. Among particular  items discussed was a report released by UKRINFORM and picked up  by Russia's Ostankino television and Mayak Radio regarding HRK  activities allegedly directed at overthrowing the Crimean  Supreme Soviet, which was labeled a provocation and as not  corresponding with the truth.    "The goal of the Crimean Civil Council is to preserve  Ukraine's territorial integrity, decisive resistance to  chauvinist demands by Crimean separatists, and the resolution of  a number of issues related to social, educational, and cultural  problems of the Ukrainian community in the Crimea, as well as  the problem of the deported nations -- not the struggle for  power," states the report by the HRK Secretariat.    Participants in the session approved the time limit, formed  the Presidium and several commissions, and appointed respective  heads.    Serhiy Lytvyn was elected head of the Crimean Civil Council,  while Oleksandr Kulyk, chief editor of KRYMSKA SVITLYTSYA  [Crimean Room] newspaper and head of the National T.G.  Shevchenko "Prosvita" Association, was appointed as his deputy.  Also approved was the line-up of the following HRK commissions:  for issues of national policies and deported nations; culture  and education; mass media and public relations; and analytical  and internal problems.    The session adopted an appeal to the electorate in  connection  with the presidential elections voicing support for L. Kravchuk  and vowing a large-scale campaign against L. Kuchma and O. Moroz.    Members of the opposition parliament went home equipped with  clear goals and plans regarding the explanation of HRK goals and  rallying people in the hinterland who care about the Crimea as  part of Ukraine.</p>

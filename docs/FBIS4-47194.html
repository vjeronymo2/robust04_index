			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikita Kirichenko and Yelena Makovskaya: </F> "Government Explains What Was in the Package"]    [Text] Last week the Russian Government, perplexed by  the ambiguous press reaction, held a press conference, where  journalists were given explanations about the published and new  documents being prepared for signing, which were drafted with  the participation of the government and the president's  apparatus and which concern the country's economic life. The  meeting was held in the Hall of Awards of the White House,  which, according to the organizers' idea, was supposed to reward  the press for the lack of timely comments by the country's  government on the package of the president's six edicts.    At a meeting with journalists Vice-Premier and Minister of  Economics Aleksandr Shokhin announced that the recent signing of  the package of edicts in no way attests to disagreements between  the government and the president's apparatus. The documents were  prepared jointly. From the vice-premier's speech it was apparent  that the sluggishness of the legislative process carried out by  the parliament forced the government and the president to "push  on" by means of edicts the development of reforms in the country  in order to stimulate deputies to adopt changes in legislation  before the beginning of vacations.    The minister admitted that the president's recent edict on  reform of state enterprises contains only part of the measures  worked out by the government in this direction. Apparently, an  edict on the procedure for the sale of insolvent enterprises  will be signed soon. (On 20 May the government issued decree No  498 "On Some Measures for the Realization of Legislation on the  Insolvency (Bankruptcy) of Enterprises," which contains  clear-cut criteria for placing enterprises in the category of  insolvent ones on the basis of balance indicators).    According to Mr. Shokhin, the evaluation of bankrupt  enterprises will be made as of 1 January 1994. The client will  have to pay 20 percent of the selling price right away. These  funds will be assigned for the liquidation of debts to  creditors. Subsequently, 50 percent of the cost is to be  assigned for the upkeep of the social sphere of the sold  enterprise. The minister added that negotiations on granting  credits to Russia for the maintenance of the social sphere of  enterprises, which were bankrupt during the transitional period,  are now being conducted with the G-7. The World Bank gave its  preliminary consent to the granting of such tied credits.    Aleksandr Shokhin admitted that the approach to the  bankruptcy procedure should be noted for special care, because  it is very expensive. (According to estimates by some directors  of administrations, it is cheaper to continue paying wages to  workers during a complete shutdown of an enterprise than to  fully carry out its bankruptcy process, where they "work"). In  this connection the minister called upon the Federal  Administration for Insolvency of Enterprises under the State  Committee on the Administration of State Property not to make  long lists of candidates for bankruptcy as long as the problem  of the funds, with which their recovery will be carried out, is  not solved. He referred to his own experience gained by him when  he was chairman of the Commission on Problems of Coal Mining  Enterprises. According to Aleksandr Shokhin, at that time the  management of a number of mines openly insisted on the closure  of production facilities in the hope of obtaining substantial  monetary injections guaranteed during the conduct of  bankruptcies by the state.    The vice-premier was unable to mention the amount of funds  provided by the federal budget in 1994 for bankruptcy  procedures. (The number of enterprises officially declared  bankrupt on the list reaches thousands. Moreover, the budget has  not yet been approved by items). However, nor does the  government agree with the proposals of the Ministry of Labor to  the effect that an "active ousting of manpower" will soon begin  in the economy. (The latest data on the rise in unemployment are  presented in the survey of consumer prices on pages 53-55. In  our opinion, in general, it is too late to make proposals and to  debate them).    Judging by the words of the minister of economics, the state  intends to examine the property belonging to it without delay  and, to begin with, to take an inventory of enterprises. Right  now it is quite obvious that an enterprise based on full  economic management, to put it mildly, is a form not profitable  for the state. It presupposes a distribution of roles, under  which the management of an enterprise adopts decisions  independently, but bears no responsibility for their  consequences. Aleksandr Shokhin believes that the right of labor  collectives (according to the Law on Enterprises and  Entrepreneurial Activity) to choose the production manager as  they wish will also contribute to such an infringement of state  rights.    It seems that from now on the state will try to more  strictly  control the system of management of state enterprises. For  example, Aleksandr Shokhin concluded, there is an urgent  question concerning the personal responsibility of the  representatives of state interests in joint-stock companies, the  shares of which it owns. An appropriate certificate will be  handed to the authorized representative. It will enable him to  participate in voting with due regard for the number of votes  falling to the share of the state. For now, however, according  to the testimony of the minister of economics, several  representatives of ministries and departments often defend state  interests in joint-stock companies at the same time and,  ultimately, those guilty and responsible for adopted decisions  are not found.    Commenting on the government decision on a reduction in  export duties on petroleum, Aleksandr Shokhin assured those  gathered that this measure "levels out the situation of  petroleum exporters, because it is supplemented by the abolition  of unsubstantiated privileges for some of them." Thus, a  reduction in duties on oil is balanced out by the receipt of  payments on the part of former "recipients of privileges" and  the effect of the adopted measures on the state of the state  treasury will prove to be neutral. True, the vice-premier added,  the decree on the abolition of privileges for exporters has not  yet been signed, because it will apply to an entire list of  licensed goods and provides for the preparation of a list of  exceptions--goods for which licensing is to be preserved (for  example, narcotic substances, weapons, and so forth).    In his speech Deputy Finance Minister Sergey Aleksashenko  also set forth the position of his department on the matter of  export privileges. "The Ministry of Finance fundamentally  opposes the granting of privileges," he declared. Mr.  Aleksashenko did not confirm the rumors on a rise in tax rates,  which have agitated the market recently. In his opinion,  although legislative initiative in the revision of tax rates  belongs to the parliament, such changes hardly await the economy  in the current year. "Budget revenues for 1994 have been  determined and, consequently, a revision of rates before 1995 is  impossible."    Vladimir Gusev, director of the State Tax Service,  responding  to the question of KOMMERSANT, declared that, in fact, the state  fails to collect substantial sums in the form of tax deductions.  Among the reasons for the reduction in tax budget revenues Mr.  Gusev mentioned not only the evasion of tax payment, but also  the nonpayment crisis, which has gripped the national economy.  According to his information, total arrears now amount to 8  trillion rubles. Funds reported by enterprises for payment, but  in reality absent in payers' accounts, account for 28 percent of  them. However, the state, Mr. Gusev reported, took a number of  steps to toughen the tax collection procedure. Tax bodies  received the right to levy execution upon debtors' current and  deposit accounts and the possibility of levying execution upon  their property is now being examined. (We present Central Bank  Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko's point of view of the recovery of  funds from the deposit account on page 11).    At the meeting with journalists government representatives  paid special attention to a discussion of the problem concerning  the activity of foreign banks in Russia's territory. We will  recall that the history of the "movement of resistance" to the  penetration of foreign banks into the country had already begun  under the previous parliament. When passions were inflamed  properly, in Russia about a dozen foreign banks either had  already received a bank license for the performance of  operations, or awaited this. Deputies of the former parliament  tried to make a number of changes in banking legislation, which  would introduce a moratorium on the receipt of licenses by new  claimants from the international banking community. Foreign  banks, which already had a general license of the Central Bank  of Russia, were offered, in essence, to switch over to the  offshore regime of work (with the right to service nonresidents  and with a ban on operations with rubles). The parliament decree  on the implementation of the mentioned amendments was disputed  by the government and immediately fell under the president's  veto.    However, the history with foreign banks received a sudden  and  an extremely unexpected continuation. The president's edict,  which refuted his own veto, was issued on 17 November 1993 on  the threshold of the elections. It followed from the text of the  document that foreign banks (as well as joint ones, where more  than 50 percent of the shares belong to foreign participants)  operating in Russia's territory... will be transferred to the  offshore regime until 1996 if they do not manage to acquire  Russian clients until 15 November 1993.    Representatives of the international banking community,  obviously, did not like the Russian saying "he who is not on  time is late." This precisely was gently pointed out to the  Russian President during his visit to Brussels. Representatives  of the European Union perceived the edict on foreign banks as a  measure worsening the banking climate in Russia, which,  obviously, contradicted the agreement with the European  Community signed by our country. The American Senate warned  Russia that the barriers established for U.S. banks would  involve American retaliatory measures. Then the biggest Russian  commercial banks, which decided to enter the European market,  felt a vague opposition on the part of local authorities. The  latter felt that they were entitled to this: What can the  applicants expect if they themselves have just slammed the door  in the face of their foreign colleagues?    The government and the Central Bank were instructed to  rectify the situation until 8 June of this year. The draft of  the president's edict, which lifts the restrictions on the  activity of foreign banks in Russia, has already been prepared  and, as Viktor Gerashchenko, head of the Central Bank, reported,  "will be published any day now." According to Aleksandr Shokhin,  Russia signed an additional agreement with the European  Community "on encouragement and protection of investments." The  prime minister also reported that a 12-percent barrier on the  amount of authorized capital is retained for foreign banks in  Russia. (This means that the combined authorized capital of  foreign banks operating in the country's territory should not  exceed 12 percent of the total authorized capital of all the  registered Russian commercial banks). Furthermore, for several  years foreign banks have been prohibited from working with  Russian securities. The next technical restriction for  subsidiary banks (also temporary) concerns balances in clients'  accounts. According to the draft document, they cannot be less  than 50,000 ECU (58,600 dollars). This measure, according to its  developers' idea, will not enable foreign banks to actively work  with private individuals.    The government decision to rectify the situation with  foreign  banks was given a hostile reception by the Association of  Russian Banks. Sergey Yegorov, its president, speaking at a  press conference on 1 June, spoke in favor of a time-out in the  admission of foreign banks into Russia. He again repeated the  well-known argument of the fighters against the penetration of  foreign banks into Russia: The need to introduce a preferential  period for the development of Russian commercial banks. In the  opinion of representatives of the Association of Russian Banks,  the resistance to the opening of affiliates and departments of  Russian banks in the territory of other states should be  overcome by means of ultimatums. Apparently, this type of  agreement presupposes a scheme similar to the procedure for the  exchange of hostages: A permit for the opening of an affiliate  of a Russian bank in a respective country should correspond to a  permit for the opening of a foreign bank in Russia. In the  opinion of KOMMERSANT, this cannot be, because this can never  be. Even if foreign bankers agreed to communicate in the  language of ultimatums, the question of the criteria of an  "equivalent exchange" would arise then and there. It is unlikely  that any of Russia's most promising commercial banks will be  able to honorably withstand such a competition.    Upon the conclusion of the government press conference  KOMMESANT experts got the impression that the second batch of  presidential edicts would be much more substantive and,  apparently, more intelligible than the first, which consisted of  six edicts and was represented in the notorious "reformer"  package of 23 May.</p>

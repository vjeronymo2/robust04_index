			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / German economist warns of recession GERMANY is in danger of sliding into recession, one of the country's leading economists said yesterday. Professor Herbert Hax, chairman of the group of independent government advisers known as the 'five wise men', said growth forecasts for 1992 could not be met. Mr Otto Lambsdorff, leader of the Free Democrats, the minority party in the governing coalition, also warned that recession would be unavoidable if financial, monetary and pay policies were not better integrated. He said he did not believe this week's government forecasts of average 3 per cent pan-German growth annually for the next five years. The assumptions on which they were based were too optimistic, he added. According to Prof Hax, the effects of the weakness of the dollar on exports and of over-generous wage settlements on company profits had compounded difficulties caused by the feebleness of the US recovery and the lack of improvement in the UK. Recession was not far away, he said in an interview to be published in Handelsblatt, a business newspaper, this morning. The warnings, which followed a steady and accelerating flow of gloomy economic and corporate indicators, suggest a distinct change of mood. In spite of mounting indications that Germany could not remain insulated indefinitely from economic conditions elsewhere, establishment figures have carefully avoided referring to recession. The country's economic condition has consistently been described as a 'lull'. Senior officials at the Bundesbank said only last week that recession was not a threat. Mr Lambsdorff's intervention, amounting to an attack on the credibility of the economic ministry, came in the form of an appeal for all efforts and investment to be directed towards rebuilding the east. If the west lost its economic strength, the east would suffer, he said. Wage increases had to be held below productivity gains in the west. Pay deals promising easterners parity by 1994 had to be be revised, and the Bundesbank had to stick to its restrictive monetary policy. The economics ministry's relatively up-beat medium-term forecasts were based on assumptions that wage rises would slow, the international economy would recover, eastern European markets would stabilise, the Gatt trade round would be concluded successfully and state spending would be controlled. On that basis, average annual growth between 1992 and 1996 would be 2.5 per cent in the west and 9 per cent in the east. Editorial Comment, Page 12</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Mario Lourdes Osorio from the "National Newscast"] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Presidency Minister Antonio  Lacayo described the visit of U.S. Congressmen to Nicaragua as  positive. He said they will have the opportunity to verify the  government's challenge.    [Begin Lacayo recording] They will be able to see, that  unlike last year, the National Assembly is working normally with  all its deputies; there is a Comptroller General who was  democratically appointed; there is also a draft military bill  agreed upon by the government and the Army, which is in fact  already in the hands of the National Assembly; there is a rich  and fruitful discussion process on possible constitutional  reforms; and we are moving ahead to solve what we call the  property conflict -- property that is both owned by U.S. as well  as Nicaraguan citizens. We are also expediting the process to  resolve the property issue through the issuance and legalization  of deeds to land beneficiaries. We have already handed out land  deeds covering more that 160,000 manzanas since September 1992  when we began the program. We will end this year with more than  300,000 total manzanas accumulated. There is also a  compensation process, through the issuance of bonds, for those  whose properties were unfairly confiscated in the last decade.  With the privatization of TELCOR [Nicaraguan Telecommunications  and Postal Services Institute], these bonds will have  substantial backing and bond holders can have confidence in them  and accept them easily, thus allowing land to be legalized for  beneficiaries. [end recording]    Regarding property legalization for U.S. citizens and the  effects of the Torricelli law, Lacayo said:    [Begin Lacayo recording] What counts is the person's  nationality at the time of the confiscation. There may be  Nicaraguans who had acquired U.S. citizenship and were affected  afterward; for us and according to international law, they are  U.S. citizens, whatever their name might be. However, if a  person's property was confiscated by the Sandinist government  while they were Nicaraguan citizens and five, six, or eight  years later they became U.S. citizens, we will simply treat them  as Nicaraguan citizens.

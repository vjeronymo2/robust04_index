To this end,  pathological states diagnosed as ``mental disorders'' and  ``nervous system diseases'' are selected due to the fact that  more than 10% of the patients have been identified as  having  these ailments. The following characteristics are considered as  the risk factors: the date of arrival to the accident zone, the  length of stay in the zone, and the external irradiation dose.  This selection is dictated by the assumption of the  stress-induced mechanism of these illnesses. The disease  detection time following the arrival at the zone for the  patients who came before and after the 120th days after the  accident and bar charts of the disease risk distribution for the  proportional and kurtosis models are plotted. An analysis shows  that arrival at the accident zone before the 120th day and the  duration of stay are indeed the principal risk factor for the  development of mental and nervous system disorders. The external  irradiation dose is identified as a risk factor which only  slightly affects morbidity; it is speculated that this factor is  an artifact arising due to the statistical correlation between  the length of stay in the zone and the irradiation dose received  therein. The conclusion is drawn that a simple proportional  model describes morbidity most adequately while the model which  reflects kurtosis is not consistent with morbidity. Figures 4;  tables 2.</p>

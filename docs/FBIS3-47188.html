			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Shigeru Komago in Washington; from the "Undercurrent" </F> column]    [Text] The U.S. Government has adopted a more realistic  attitude toward Japan. This was because of advice from U.S.  Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale. According to a number of  senior U.S. officials, Mondale, through his contacts with U.S.  Government officials visiting Japan, and correspondences by  telephone or telegram, has persistently stressed that "we must  make the Japan- U.S. summit meeting in February a success in  consideration of the difficulties facing Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa." The former vice president's judgment about the  situation may have reminded the Clinton administration, however  briefly, of the story of "The North Wind and the Sun" in Aesop's  fables.    The Clinton administration's demands on Japan have become  much more acceptable to Japan, compared to its previous  position, since mid-December. Comments on the issue of the  Japan-U.S. economic framework talks can be taken as a softening  of the U.S. position, including the suggestion that "we will not  seek market share targets," and the remark "we would like to  reach agreement only on guiding Japan to open its market to a  degree comparable to other advanced nations."    Even in the area of macroeconomic policy, the United States  has refrained from making concrete demands, claiming "we are not  in a position to talk about the precise scale and schedule of  the income tax cut in Japan." And on the matter of the yen  exchange rate, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen went beyond an  acceptance of the present exchange rate to make remarks which  could be taken to mean a toleration of a further depreciation of  the yen against the dollar.    This change came after Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger  Altman  visited Japan in mid-December. Senior U.S. Government officials  not only exchanged views with Japanese officials, but were also  briefed by Mondale on the economic and political situation in  Japan, and given the advice that "it will not do to be on the  offensive all the time."    In other words, "the sun will be more effective than the  north wind in making Japan, which is wrapped in warm clothing,  disrobe, or open its markets and expand domestic demand."    Since then, the U.S. Government has not publicly made any  unreasonable demands regarding Japanese economic stimulation  measures, and has temporarily toned down its unacceptable  demands at the framework talks.    Admittedly, U.S. officials in charge of the talks are also  anxious because "our performance will be assessed on the outcome  of the framework talks." The Clinton administration has made  "three consecutive hits" in trade policy with the ratification  of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Asian  Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference (APEC), and the GATT  multilateral trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round). U.S. Trade  Representative (USTR) Mickey Kantor is eager to "make a `cycle  hit' [a Japanese-coined baseball term referring to the same  player making a single-base hit, a two-base hit, a three-base  hit, and a home run in one single game] by concluding the  framework talks successfully." However, it will reflect poorly  on the officials concerned if there is no agreement reached in  February.    It now remains to be seen how the Japanese Government will  take advantage of the realistic line adopted by the United  States, which has been the combined result of the advice from  the former U.S. vice president and the desire of U.S. officials  to put on a good performance.</p>

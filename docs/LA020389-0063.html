			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 1992 CAMPAIGN;  </P> <P> HOPE TO RUN IF NEW DISTRICT MATERIALIZES  </P> <P> Tony Hope said Thursday that he plans to seek the Republican nomination for  Congress again in 1992 if, as he expects, a new district is created in the West  San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> "I fully expect to do that," said Hope, a Harvard-educated attorney and the son  of entertainer Bob Hope.  </P> <P> Hope, 48, has raised his political profile with his recent nomination to the  state Republican Central Committee by Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi  Valley). His confirmation is expected when the party convenes Feb. 18 for its  next convention.  </P> <P> In 1986, Hope had sought the GOP nomination for the 21st District seat vacated  by then-Rep. Bobbie Fiedler but was upset by Mayor Elton Gallegly, then the  mayor of Simi Valley. Nevertheless, Hope proved a prolific fund-raiser. His  financial supporters included former Presidents Gerald R. Ford and Richard M.  Nixon and many prominent members of the entertainment industry.  </P> <P> Hope, reached in Washington, D.C., Thursday, said he would not challenge  Gallegly, with whom he has consulted periodically.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Health Care Job  </P> <P> Hope is a senior vice president of Mutual of Omaha, where he is responsible for  long-range planning for health-care issues. He said he divides his time between  the firm's Washington and Los Angeles offices. His wife, Judy, is a trial  attorney with the Los Angeles law firm of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &amp;  Walker.  </P> <P> Contrary to a report in Thursday's editions of The Times, Hope has been  registered as a Republican to vote in North Hollywood since July 21, 1987, and  has a California driver's license.  </P> <P> Shortly before announcing his candidacy in 1986, Hope had moved to a Northridge  home after a 10-year absence from California -- prompting Gallegly to brand him  a carpetbagger. He subsequently sold that house.  </P> <P> Hope said he has remained active in California political and civic affairs  since his inaugural bid for public office, giving speeches to Republican groups  and participating in the California Bar Assn. He is also chairman of the board  of Mount Vernon College in Washington.  </P> <P> He readily acknowledged that defeat did not diminish his desire to go to  Congress -- if the opportunity presents itself.  </P> <P> The state's 45 congressional districts will be redrawn by the Legislature and  governor after the 1990 election. California is projected to gain about five  additional seats as a result of its increased population, with the majority in  fast-growing Southern California.  </P> <P> Though the redistricting will not begin until the 1990 Census is completed,  Hope outlined a scenario that he said could make his candidacy a reality. It  calls for pushing Gallegly's 21st District -- which includes Republican-leaning  parts of the Los Angeles communities of Northridge, Canoga Park, Granada Hills  and Woodland Hills -- entirely into Ventura County, which has grown  substantially in the past decade, Hope said.  </P> <P> As a result, he said, a new district "will get created in the Valley."  </P> <P> It remains to be seen, however, whether the Democrats will allow a  Republican-dominated district to be established in the Valley, especially if  they win control of the governorship as well as both houses of the Legislature  in 1990.  </P> <P> Their first priority is likely to be protecting veteran Reps. Anthony C.  Beilenson (D-Tarzana) and Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), who represent  most of the West and East Valleys, respectively.  </P> <P> The more conservative Valley portion of Beilenson's 23rd District is more than  offset by the 40% of the district on the staunchly liberal Westside. Beilenson  was reelected to a seventh term last November with 63% of the vote.  </P></p>

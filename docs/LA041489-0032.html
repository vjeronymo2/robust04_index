			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WITHOUT A DOUBT;  </P> <P> NEW-FOUND CONFIDENCE MAKES RANDY COOPER THE TOUGHEST OUT IN A POTENT CANYONS'  LINEUP  </P> <P> Randy Cooper wears such a broad, What, Me Worry? grin, it is difficult to  believe he spent all of last season playing a scared second base for College of  the Canyons.  </P> <P> Barreling baserunners who slid, spikes high, to break up double plays did not  faze Cooper, nor did high-and-tight offerings from pitchers intent on brushing  the Hoover High graduate off the plate.  </P> <P> Cooper's fear sprung from self doubt.  </P> <P> The highly successful Canyons baseball program annually draws talented high  school players from throughout the Valley area. Cooper himself opted to become  a Cougar rather than attend Glendale College, which is located less than three  minutes from his parents' house.  </P> <P> Yet despite performing at a level that produced a .333 batting average and  second-team All-Western State Conference honors, Cooper felt his daily  contributions were not up to par for himself or the powerful Cougars, who have  won eight consecutive WSC titles.  </P> <P> "Last year, I was nervous," Cooper said. "Every game, I thought, 'Dang, am I  going to be in there next game?"  </P> <P> This season, Canyons Coach Len Mohney says he can't imagine filling out a  lineup card without Cooper's name at second base or center field.  </P> <P> And the only people worried this season are opposing coaches and pitchers who  have tried unsuccessfully to stop Cooper from wreaking havoc.  </P> <P> "Canyons has some other kids with more home runs," Valley Coach Chris Johnson  said, "but as far as getting pitched to, Randy Cooper is their toughest out."  </P> <P> Cooper's fear apparently has struck out.  </P> <P> He is relaxed and batting .434 overall and .473 in conference play for Canyons  (17-12 overall, 10-4 in the WSC), which is embroiled in a legitimate race for  the championship for the first time in years.  </P> <P> "He's really on a roll now," Mohney said of Cooper. "I think he has to be a  Division I guy."  </P> <P> Cooper's prowess has forced Mohney to tinker with what he hoped would be a  batting order set in stone, or at least fiery aluminum. Originally, the middle  of the Cougars' lineup was to feature a mini-Murderers' Row of sophomores Chris  Joy, Peter Washington and Don Pedersen.  </P> <P> Cooper, however, killed that idea with his increased production.  </P> <P> "Last year, Randy was one of the soldiers," Mohney said. "This year he's one of  the guys the guys look for to carry the bulk a little."  </P> <P> Handling responsibility for his team's success is easier than it might have  been in the past for Cooper because, physically, he is much different player  than he was a year ago when he weighed as little as 149 pounds.  </P> <P> This season, the 5-foot-9 1/2 Cooper maintains 172 pounds, the result of a  self-prescribed, year-long weightlifting program.  </P> <P> "He took it on his own and went for it," said Mohney, who often opens the  Canyons weight room for Cooper after games. "He said, 'Hey, I need to be a  little stronger.' A lot of guys know that but they don't have the discipline to  do it, which is a different thing."  </P> <P> Cooper said undertaking the regimen was a necessary step toward playing for a  Division I program next season.  </P> <P> "It was obvious that if I wanted to go someplace big I was going to have to  change something," said Cooper, who has two home runs and 30 runs batted in.  "Last year, to hit the ball far, I had to swing from my butt. Now I just have  to jab at it and it goes.  </P> <P> "People say you shouldn't lift weights if you're a baseball player because you  get too tense. But I haven't seen anything bad happen in my arm or anything. I  think it's made my arm stronger."  </P> <P> It's also made Cooper into a part-time outfielder.  </P> <P> "I think sometimes he's not real excited about being out there," Mohney said.  "But he's our best center fielder."  </P> <P> Cooper was reared as a shortstop at Hoover, where he played four years of  varsity baseball under his father, Bob, batting .432 as a senior.  </P> <P> He turned down a partial scholarship at Cal State Long Beach, where his  brother, Robby, was a senior, and enrolled at Canyons, where Jeff Flesher, who  would go on to become the WSC Player of the Year, established himself as the  starting shortstop.  </P> <P> Cooper was a role player for the Cougars, who finished 32-6 overall and 22-3 in  conference play with dominant players such as Flesher and pitcher Tim Nedin and  dominant personalities like catcher Mike Bible.  </P> <P> "Bible was the leader, one of those types that says, 'C'mon man, let's go pull  their nostril hair out,' " said Cooper, who is a captain this season. "I'm not  that vocal. I don't consider myself a big leader. Just someone who plays hard  all the time."  </P> <P> As Canyons battles Ventura, Moorpark, Valley and Oxnard for the WSC  championship, the Cougars find themselves in an unfamiliar setting -- a  competitive race for the pennant.  </P> <P> "It's surprising how people just get in your kitchen because you haven't put it  away," Mohney said. "Who knows? We could still win this sucker."  </P> <P> Should the Cougars rally for their ninth consecutive title, it will likely be  on the bulky shoulders of Cooper, who traded his insecurity for the confidence  that breeds success.  </P> <P> "Now I stand up there like I did in high school," Cooper said. "I sort of look  at the guy (pitcher) like, 'You're going to get hit. And you're going to get  hit hard.' "  </P></p>

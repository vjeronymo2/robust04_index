			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Ministers weigh future of London's hospitals MINISTERS will today begin considering a report which is likely to lead to the biggest ever shake-up in London's hospital services. The final version of the report by Sir Bernard Tomlinson, former chairman of the Northern Regional Health Authority, is in the hands of Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary. Mrs Bottomley - who has received regular progress reports from Sir Bernard during his year-long investigation of health provision in London - will publish the report around the end of this month. There will then be a period of consultation - and furious campaigning by hospitals identified for closure - before ministers make final decisions in the new year. Some of the capital's most famous teaching hospitals - including St Bartholomew's, St Thomas', University College, the Middlesex and Charing Cross - have been considered for closure or change of use during Sir Bernard's inquiry. In a last-minute submission to Sir Bernard last week, the St Thomas' management said the capital costs associated with closing either St Thomas' or the neighbouring Guy's teaching hospital would be so great as to 'negate for at least the first 10 years' any revenue savings.' St Thomas' management argued that both hospitals should survive, with St Thomas' concentrating on emergency and local work and Guy's developing specialist services. Under that plan, three local hospitals in south London - Hither Green in Lewisham, Dulwich in Southwark and Brook in Greenwich - would close instead of either of the teaching hospitals. Guy's accident and emergency department would close under the plan, which argues that a combination of St Thomas' and University College hospitals would provide the most effective emergency cover for central London. No solution excluding St Thomas', the submission says, would provide cover within 10 minutes for Whitehall and state occasions in Westminster. The St Thomas' research draws on work commissioned from Ernst and Young, management consultants, transport specialists at Imperial College, London, and other sources. In its submission, the St Thomas' management challenges the view of South East Thames Regional Health Authority that either St Thomas' or Guy's could close - eliminating 800 beds in addition to other rationalisation plans in south London. There is, the submission says, no evidence that local health services in south London would be in place to support reduced demand on hospital beds.</p>

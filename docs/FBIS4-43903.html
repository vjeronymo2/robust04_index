			<p>BFN     [Text] Weimar (DPA) -- The Bundestag Group chairmen of the  Christian Democratic Union [CDU] and the Christian Social Union  [CSU] have called on the Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD] federal party congress in Halle "to dissociate itself  clearly from cooperation with the Party of Democratic Socialism  [PDS] at all levels." In a statement by the Bundestag Group  Chairmen's Conference in Weimar on Tuesday [21 June], the  successor organization of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany  [SED] is called extreme-left and a danger to democracy. The  chiefs of the CDU and CSU groups demanded that political action  be taken against the PDS with all democratic means.    The declaration, which was unanimously adopted in Weimar,  says that the PDS has to be combated in the same way as the  extreme-right Republikaner. The SPD is particularly requested  to do this. "It is part of the SPD's historical omissions that  it does not dissociate itself from extreme-left forces clearly  enough." The SPD merger with the Communist Party of Germany  into the SED in eastern Germany in April 1946 had disastrous  consequences for many upright Social Democrats, it was stated.</p>

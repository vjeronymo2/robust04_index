			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: First with the latest - Joanna Slaughter on investment managers / The Professionals, James Capel At James Capel, the directors of the UK investment management division like to boast that their private clients receive the latest market information before the institutions. Certainly, Capel's independent research team is both respected and admired, thanks to its habit of dominating the investment analysis league tables. The firm also believes it has an advantage as one of Britain's oldest stockbrokers, and from safeguarding its independence while benefiting from the resources of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation which acquired Capel eight years ago. Simon Corbett, the director in charge of the division, says: 'Stock selection is what James Capel is very good at, and stock selection is the edge that we have. 'We are big stockbrokers, and I think it is very important in managing private client portfolios to continue to be involved with the market, minute by minute.' Capel is willing to construct a portfolio of equities for a private client with Pounds 100,000 of assets, a relatively modest minimum figure in today's market place. The house view is that each client needs at least 20 stocks for spread and that Pounds 5,000 is the minimum working unit for a shareholding. The client's exposure to overseas markets is provided by collective funds and, with Pounds 500m of private client money in unit trusts and investment trusts, Capel devotes considerable research to these investment vehicles. Andrew Withey, senior investment strategist, explains: 'We rate all the major unit trusts, investment trusts and offshore funds on a scale of A to E, and the James Capel trusts are assessed and rated like anyone else in the market. We go through the performance and the portfolios and, in a lot of cases, we will have the managers in.' Although Capel is basically an equity house, the acquisition of Midland bank by HSBC brought W. Greenwell into the fold. With Greenwell came a wealth of gilts expertise, and Capel's directors argue that one of the firm's strengths is the diversity of experience it can bring to private client portfolio management. Private investors are the firm's main pre-occupation, and Corbett points to the large number of people there who are dedicated to the business of running private client money. There are 59 private client fund managers, 40 of whom are front-line private client executives. There are no formal white or black lists of shares to constrain the managers, but Corbett says they would not buy shares in companies not followed by James Capel and the other three investment houses from which it takes research. Each manager appears to have considerable freedom but there is no cover for rogue elephants. The managers meet each morning, to discuss deals done the previous day, and the purchase of a strange or wayward stock would be exposed quickly. The strategy committee confers monthly and provides the models around which the investment managers work. Withey, who chairs the committee, says it tries not to make dramatic overnight asset allocation shifts. He adds: 'Back at the end of last year we were a bit nervous and raised about 3 or 4 per cent in cash, but today we are all but fully invested.' The framework asset allocation for equity portfolios reflects this view, with 99 per cent of the holding in shares and the 1 per cent balance in cash. Four per cent of the equity portfolio is in emerging markets and Withey says: 'Investment money follows growth. Most of the mature economies of the world are struggling to grow at 2 or 3 per cent, but, if you look at emerging markets, growth is 5 or 6 per cent.' For balanced portfolios, the Capel breakdown is: UK equities, 61 per cent; US, 5 per cent; Japan, 5 per cent; Europe, 3 per cent; Mature Pacific, 3 per cent; Emerging Pacific, 1 per cent; other emerging markets, 2 per cent; long-dated gilts, 13 per cent; short-dated gilts; 2 per cent; index-linked gilts, 1 per cent; overseas bonds, 1 per cent; and cash, 1 per cent. Sixty per cent of Capel's private client money is managed on an advisory basis and, although the firm's preference is for discretionary money, Corbett concedes: 'It is a very good discipline to have advisory clients. You have got to sell advice to them, and that means you have to get your act together.' Unlike some leading private client stockbrokers, Capel has moved to management fees on the ground that this is a 'much fairer way' to pay for its services. But the strategy is to keep charges relatively low and competitive: the minimum annual fee is Pounds 750. Discretionary clients also receive a 40 per cent discount on transaction charges. Capel sometimes advertises its private client services and it would be strange if the directors had not cast a glance at the potential of Midland bank to introduce new clients. The most prolific source of new business is, however, the firm's existing clients. 'They're the best sales force we have,' says Corbett.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Investment managers: factfile 8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- James Capel James Capel Investment Management  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Established: 1775 Regulator: SFA Number of offices in the UK: One Number of offices worldwide: 27 in 25 countries Funds under managment: Pounds 4.5bn (private client money); Dollars                        33bn (group) Number of UK private clients: 10,500 Number of expatriate/foreign national private clients: 1,650 Minimum investment for private clients: Pounds 100,000 (portfolio of equities); Pounds 25,000 (managed fund portfolio service) Current asset allocation for private clients: 61%; overseas equities 19%; bonds, 19%; cash, 1% Average annual portfolio turnover: 25-30%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fees: 0.6% on first Pounds 500,000, 0.3% next Pounds 500,000 and 0.15% thereafter (minimum Pounds 750 a year) plus transaction commissions at a 40% discount (discretionary clients); Pounds 250 administration fee plus transaction commissions ranging from 1.85% to 0.3% (advisory clients)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

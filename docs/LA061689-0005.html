			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. POLICY IN CENTRAL AMERICA  </P> <P> Amen to your editorial opposition to covert electoral support to the Nicaraguan  opposition.  </P> <P> But how can you maintain that it is the Sandinista government which has made a  mess of Nicaragua's economy? Surely most of the blame must fall on the U.S.  embargo.  </P> <P> I hope President Bush will recognize that, and lift the embargo. After all, he  made the welcome and humane statement that he would not countermand grain sales  to the People's Republic of China as a sign of U.S. dismay at the Tian An Men  Square massacre. We should be unwilling to inflict starvation and misery on any  people, be they Chinese or Nicaraguan!  </P> <P> HELEN L. TRAVIS  </P> <P> San Pedro  </P></p>

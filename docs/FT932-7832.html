			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Good news on UK earnings CELEBRATIONS ARE indeed in order. But this is not mainly because seasonally adjusted unemployment has declined for the third successive month, if by a mere 1,400. Far more encouraging is the further fall in pay inflation. The UK now has a chance to secure the stable, low-inflation economy for which so many have suffered so much. Over the three months to April 8 seasonally adjusted unemployment fell by 52,700. This is unprecedented at so early a stage of an upturn. One explanation for the good news is the strength of the recovery, as shown in data on retail sales and manufacturing output published earlier this week. The 'hire and fire' mentality is another explanation, the implication being that the falling unemployment must be set against the huge increases at the end of last year. The inflow into the labour force is also smaller than in the early 1980s. Against such optimistic views of the prospects must be set the lack of any significant increase in the stock of vacancies, following its jump between January and February. The unexpected declines in unemployment may simply reflect an overhang of Jobcentre placement targets last financial year. If so, they will not continue. The picture should be clearer when information on employment in the first quarter of 1993 becomes available in the next Labour Force Survey, due in June. Less murky, and more encouraging, is the decline in the underlying annual increase in whole economy earnings, to 4 per cent. Seasonally adjusted earnings rose 2 per cent in manufacturing in March, but fell 0.6 per cent in services. This divergence, already apparent earlier this year, may reflect sterling's departure from the ERM. Nevertheless, wages and salaries per unit of manufactured output fell by 2.9 per cent over the year to March, because of a 7.8 per cent rise in output per head. Taken with the Bank of England's latest forecast for underlying inflation over the next 18 months, these trends imply negligible growth in real earnings. One implication is that growth in real expenditure per worker would make little contribution to the recovery in demand. A more favourable one is that real earnings would grow more slowly than labour productivity. That is precisely how to combine devaluation with stable inflation. It is also how to increase incentives for employment. Low growth in real wages has to be a better way to sustain competitiveness than fast productivity growth in an economy with some 3m unemployed. If the underlying increase in earnings were kept to 4 per cent, or less, it would be possible to combine low inflation with modest increases in real earnings per worker. This mixture can give the UK the steady rise in output and employment that it needs. It could even justify the stringent disinflationary policies of the past several years. Mr Major may U-turn elsewhere. On this he must not.</p>

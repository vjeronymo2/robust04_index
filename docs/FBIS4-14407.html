			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Irina Bolshova and Vladimir </F> Kikilo]    [Text] Moscow March 30 TASS -- Russia and the United States  signed agreements on trade and economic cooperation in Moscow on  Wednesday.    Russian Vice-Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin and visiting  U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown signed a joint statement  giving the two countries access to each other's markets. Brown  and Russian Minister of Foreign Economic Relations Oleg Davydov  signed a memorandum to establish American business centres in  Russia, a joint statement to improve terms of cooperation in  medical industry and a document on the American-Russian Business  Development Committee.    "We attach great importance to the visit to Russia by a  representative U.S. delegation led by Secretary of Commerce Ron  Brown," Davydov said. "Two days is not enough to solve all our  questions which have piled up since the cold war era. But we  have moved along this path. This is proved by the documents we  have signed. They allow our trade and economic ties to develop  more successfully. Additionally, we discussed issues which  still impede our cooperation, including flaws in Russian laws  and the difficulties which remain in the American trade laws  with respect to Russian manufacturers," he said.    Davydov said that American colleagues understand the need of  lifting trade restrictions on Russian goods and assured him that  the U.S. will take concrete steps in this direction. [sentence  as received]    The committee plans to hold its next meeting in Washington  in  June 1994 to discuss large American investments in Russia. "We  have pledged to provide maximum state support for these  projects. This particularly concerns the Sakhalin-2 project and  the development of the Timano-Pechora oil deposit," the minister  said.    Another key issue do be discussed in June will be the  removal  of barriers hampering Russian-American trade and economic  cooperation.</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Kinshasa riots trigger clampdown on meetings MR MUNGUL DIAKA, governor of Zaire's capital Kinshasa, yesterday banned all political meetings and public gatherings in the wake of last week's riots in which at least 65 people died, Reuter reports from Kinshasa. The governor, an ally of embattled President Mobutu Sese Seko, also announced that any newspaper considered to be inciting hatred and violence would be seized. The capital, a sprawling city of 3m people, remained tense yesterday but appeared quiet, despite bursts of rifle fire and the dull boom of heavier weapons being heard throughout Sunday night. State radio said some looting continued. Central Kinshasa was virtually deserted again. Few cars were on the streets, although growing numbers of pedestrians were venturing outside. The smart Gombe district, which includes embassies and the luxury Intercontinental Hotel packed with rich families escaping the violence, has been declared a military 'operational zone.' However, Zairean residents said they had no trouble entering or leaving the area. The military zone was clearly meant not so much to stop looters as to warn soldiers from Belgium, Zaire's former colonial power, not to land to evacuate their nationals. At least 400 Belgian paratroops have arrived in the Congolese capital Brazzaville, just across the river, but Mr Mobutu has denied them permission to enter Zaire. Several dozen French troops are already in Kinshasa to protect French citizens, with Mr Mobutu's approval. Belgian companies operating in the country have repatriated most of their expatriate staff from the capital, several of the companies said yesterday, Reuter writes from Brussels. Belgium on Sunday asked all its citizens in Kinshasa to gather to be repatriated. There were around 1,000 Belgian nationals in Kinshasa.</p>

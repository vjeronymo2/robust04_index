			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Duma Press" report] </F>   [Text] The Kozloduy Nuclear Power Station has announced  that the No. 1 reactor unit has been shut down because of a  minor defect, namely poor flow in bleeding air from the No. 1  main circulating pump. The unit was shut down on instructions  from the central operations room. There are no changes in the  radiation situation in the country. The defect will be repaired  by the end of the week. Even with the No. 1 reactor out of  operation, the nuclear power station is producing 1,520  megawatts, so the national grid will not be affected.</p>

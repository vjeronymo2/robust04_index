			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Beijing executes eight for fraud CHINA executed eight young financial workers yesterday in what officials called the biggest cases of public embezzlement since the 1949 communist revolution, Reuter reports from Beijing. The country also announced the arrest of a Chinese reporter from a Hong Kong newspaper on charges of 'espionage regarding state secrets on banking'. An unspecified number of alleged conspirators were arrested in the case involving Mr Xi Yang of Ming Pao daily, the Xinhua news agency said. A Ming Pao editor in Hong Kong called for Mr Xi's release. High publicity surrounding the executions and the apparently unrelated arrests indicated they were part of top-level campaigns to bring order to the chaotic and primitive financial sector and to crack down on corruption. Mr Jiang Zemin, Communist party chief, recently targeted corruption as a 'virus' that if not checked could destroy Chinese socialism. The People's Supreme Court rejected appeals from the financial workers, mostly accountants in their 20s and 30s and including one woman, and ordered them executed. 'These people lusted for profits, were very bold and ran wild,' Mr Liu Jiachen, court vice-president, was quoted by state radio as saying. He called their bounty 'extraordinarily large. They took advantage of the poor management of their banks,' he said. The largest case involved theft of Yn33m (Pounds 3.7m) by five defendants.</p>

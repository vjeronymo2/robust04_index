			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has denied  reports of future cuts in antiaircraft defense troops. Instead,  in conversation with journalists he said that the military  department has examined the issue of the expediency of  continuing to preserve the present antiaircraft defense  structure. In Grachev's opinion, under current conditions there  is no need for antiaircraft defense forces to cover all sites.  Therefore a decision has been taken on protecting only main  sites, in particular nuclear and hydroelectric power stations,  defense industry factories, and state institutions throughout  Russia. Grachev also reported that the military department  intends to get rid of antiquated antiaircraft defense systems.</p>

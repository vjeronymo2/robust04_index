			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / How To Spend It: An open and shut case . . . - Heather Farmbrough finds out what makes a good holdall For every Weekend FT reader who regards buying a briefcase as a tedious but unavoidable chore, there will be another who delights in the soft leather and subtle colours of a well-made case. To some, a briefcase is simply a concession to professional convention - there are far easier ways to carry things than in a small box which makes one's shoulders ache. To others, however, a briefcase is as essential an accessory as a pair of good shoes, a reliable indicator of its owner's style and personality. Even if you think of briefcases as dull but practical necessities, there is no reason to settle for a boring box; over the last few years, briefcase design has become increasingly sophisticated and imaginative. It is possible to find a relatively robust simple one for around Pounds 100 but there are, it seems, plenty of people who will spend Pounds 600 on a briefcase and expect it to last for their career. If you are paying these kinds of sums you usually get a life-time guarantee for your money. For instance in London, Swaine, Adeney, Brigg &amp; Sons, of Piccadilly, (071-734 4277) and The Coach Store, 8 Sloane Street (071-235 1507) will carry out reasonable repairs free of charge. If you are thinking of buying a new briefcase it is worth spending some time thinking about what you really need. Does sturdiness matter most or do you want more of a style statement? Do you need a conventional case or would you prefer to be a little more adventurous? Do you want a case which you can simply reach inside without having to put on a flat surface to open? And do you need a lock, or are you the kind of person who is bound to lose the key or forget the combination? Few people think carefully before buying. Most people seem to acquire briefcases in a haphazard way. We asked some of our readers how they had come by theirs. Alex Rhodes, a 34-year-old director of a qualitative market research company acquired her briefcase accidentally. 'My husband had always wanted a decent briefcase and he bought one in the Coach sale. I took one look at it and said it was much too feminine because it had a shoulder strap. I thought he was going to take it back and exchange it, but he left it on my bed with a note saying it was a present for me. 'I love the strap - it's much easier to carry when you're also carrying a hand-bag. The front pockets are useful and the zip on the small pocket at the back stops my business cards falling out. There's plenty of room: I've got two folders in here, an A4 pad, a Filofax, pens, tape-recorder and a compartment for a newspaper. 'My old one was much larger and harder wearing, but this feels much smarter. It makes a big difference - I feel as if this makes me look more professional.' Barry Jones, a 43-year-old management consultant, was more than a little annoyed when the locks broke on his 10-month old case from Swaine, Adeney, Brigg, particularly, as he says: 'I was at a clients' meeting when the lock broke; I couldn't open my briefcase to get out the slides I'd prepared, which was extremely embarrassing. 'I took it back to the shop the next morning and was asked for proof of purchase; this annoyed me because when you pay a ridiculous amount of money for a hand-made briefcase you don't expect the retailer to question you. 'Now my most important requirement is that a briefcase is relatively robust and won't collapse if I crush too much in. I chose this one because it looked strong and well made and I thought it would last a long time, but in reality it didn't. 'Does it matter to clients what kind of briefcase I have? No, I don't think clients really care. What matters more is that it shouldn't have a label. On the whole I just think it's important to have a briefcase that looks professional.' Paul Mullins, a 34-year-old merchant banker, puts practical considerations before appearance. He has a two-year-old Papworth which was a gift. Its greatest asset, he says, is that it's made from very stiff leather - the kind used for bridles or saddles - and has no frame. 'I want as much space as possible; I find it odd that most cases are too small to fit in even two pads of A4 paper side by side. It is quite heavy - but if a briefcase is really heavy then you're carrying too much or not delegating enough. 'The combination locks have both broken so I've had them changed to key-locks. Briefcase locks all tend to be appalling - but then it's usually completely inessential to lock a briefcase. If someone steals it, they'll probably open it anyway with a crowbar. 'I doubt this will last much more than 10 years. I want a long-lasting case  -I'm not interested in brand names. I look on buying a briefcase as a distress purchase - if you go much beyond Pounds 300 then you're starting to pay for image.' Nigel Crump, 43, takes this theory one step further and has rejected a conventional briefcase in favour of a 13in by 13in brown and black fabric shoulder/satchel bag. As an architect and builder he rarely wears a suit, with which, he says, his bag might look incongruous. 'I think it's called a jolly bag - I bought it in Hong Kong for about Pounds 20, 10 years ago. It has two pockets at the front, compartments and a flap inside and it does up with a zip. It's a sturdy practical bag; it contains a camera, telephone, measuring tape, drawing pad and clipboard.' He needs to be able to carry it while on building sites so the shoulder strap is important. 'I've kept it because it's very practical. I don't care what anyone else thinks of it, but I daresay in certain professions it would be viewed with suspicion. I keep thinking I must change and get a nice old fashioned leather case but I just haven't got round to it.' Whatever you choose you must feel comfortable. Andrew Mitchell, a 42-year-old chairman of an advertising agency has a Loewe case which he has never dared use. 'It was a leaving present from my previous agency, but it's so lovely I feel I can't take it on the Underground. Come the day when I can drive to work again, I'll use it. In the meantime, I'm using a black Samsonite PVC attache case with aluminium trim, about 3in deep, which my father gave me when I was 10. 'I'm a pretty big chap - I'm 6ft 1in - but I was mugged a year ago on the Tube in the rush hour. I was absolutely determined not to let go of my case which was wrenched from me and split open, the handle twisted. 'But I still use it; I carry all my expense forms, pens, a calculator and a file. If I were choosing another, I'd go for a basic holdall, perhaps slightly bigger. 'I'd want sleeves or folders in the lid because I always carry agency brochures. In the meantime, I'm hanging on to this; I'm very emotionally attached to it. I've been using it consistently for 32 years and I don't have the heart to throw it away.'</p>

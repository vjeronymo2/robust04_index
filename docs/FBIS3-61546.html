			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview between Vladimir Gubarev and Vladimir Chernyshev, </F> doctor of physical and mathematical sciences: ``This Explosion  Is an Echo of the Future''; the first five paragraphs are an  introduction]    [Text] Vladimir Chebyshev, doctor of physical and  mathematical sciences, tells of the importance of the first  Russian-American experiment carried out at the Russian Federal  Nuclear Center.    ``In its importance that which occurred at work site No. 3  at  Arzamas-16 is comparable to the launch of the first artificial  earth satellite,'' said the American professor Steven Younger,  ``and I do not exaggerate a whit because that work which we are  engaged in is of enormous importance for the fate of  civilization, it is no less inferior to space research, and  therefore I have the right to make such a comparison with the  launch of the satellite...''    We will not dispute the American professor; he possibly  exaggerates, but it is possible to understand him: for many  months he ``fought'' the higher powers in the United States for  the ``right'' to carry out joint work with the Russians (they  have the same problems as we do!) and therefore the successful  completion of the experiment so exhilarated Professor Younger.  After all, this also justified the efforts made and what is most  important, the doors were now flung wide open for future  cooperation.    On our side the director was Professor Chernyshev. And what  is there to hide; to a great extent due to Vladimir  Konstantinovich everything went off brilliantly. After all, it  was precisely he who was not only the ideological inspiration of  the devised program, but also its organizer and executor. It was  precisely the ``Chernyshev team,''riveted for many years on a  single goal, which realized the ``launch of the first joint  `thermonuclear satellite' in the history of the two  countries--Russia and the United States.''    Our conversation with the scientist began with the  traditional question:    Gubarev: Who are you?    Chernyshev: Division head at the All-Union  Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics, doctor of  physical and mathematical sciences. I have been working here  since 1950, since immediately after graduation from the Moscow  Physical Engineering Institute...    Gubarev: And how did you chance to come here?    Chernyshev: I was chosen at the institute.  Evidently someone took notice of me. I graduated from the  institute with "flying colors."    Gubarev: Did you know where you were going?    Chernyshev: When I asked about this they told me  that it was somewhere within the boundaries of Gorkiy Oblast.    Gubarev: What was your first impression?    Chernyshev: Very unusual... It was winter,  January. There was a great deal of snow. The streets were very  well plowed. Young soldiers in sheepskin coats maintained order.  I felt concern about who lived here. And the living conditions  were very comfortable for the young specialists who came here.  Don't forget that 1950 had come and you can imagine what the  situation was in the country... We were quartered in hotel No.  2. Comfortable conditions, exactly the opposite from how we  lived in Moscow! When we arrived in the dining hall we were  surprised at the choice of dishes. And our first impression was  that we had arrived in a ``corner of paradise.''    Gubarev: And the next day?    Chernyshev: Work began.    Gubarev: Was it also like paradise?    Chernyshev: It was really work, very interesting,  and I recall those years with satisfaction. The people paid no  heed to time. It was commonplace to return from the work site  sometime in the middle of the night and even toward dawn.  Everyone worked with enthusiasm and each of understood that an  extremely important task was being performed. None of us knew  precisely what it was, but we guessed vaguely...    Gubarev: And when you learned for the first time  that you were working on a weapon?    Chernyshev: The first year I vaguely guessed the  nature of the work and a little later began to participate in  discussions of the problems and naturally I understood that we  were dealing with the manufacture of a nuclear weapon. I began  to learn from Mikhail Yakovlevich Vasilyev. He was an  exceptional lover of work, a fine experimenter, a very honest  person... I always remember him with great warmth. He instilled  in us a feeling of responsibility for the delegated task. He was  our teacher.    A little later in the course of the work I had the  opportunity to interact with Yuliy Borisovich Khariton. The  meetings with him, I believe, left an indelible impression not  only on me, but also on all the young specialists.    Gubarev: You are the experimenter. You did not  know in detail about similar work which had been carried out in  the United States. So how come you were at a very high level and  were on a par with the Americans?    Chernyshev: Many specialists of our institute are  very high-class specialists. And each in his own field can be  proud of what he has done. Sooner or later each will be asked  the question; ``And what did you do?'' And if you judge  honestly, then the fingers on one hand will suffice to list the  tasks done, but each of these tasks performed will bring you  satisfaction because it was of a high class. And more than just  one or two tens of specialists at our institute can be proud of  such results. Now, looking backward and comparing the work of  our specialists with those at other institutes, you are  convinced time and again that a unique scientific center was  established here with an enormous scientific-technical  capability.    Gubarev: You constantly set off explosions. And  were there many such experiments?    Chernyshev: Many thousands. Especially during the  first years we worked day and night and therefore there were a  great many explosions.    Gubarev: And just why did you set off the  explosions?    Chernyshev: Even the most magnificent  theoreticians cannot foresee everything. Usually there are close  to the truth, but all the fascination is that you get a wet film  and you see how the theoretical computations and the  experimental results differ substantially because the phenomena  with which you are dealing are nevertheless very complex.  Mankind also has very little work experience in this field,  after all, we are talking about high energy densities when a  high concentration of energy, high temperatures and pressures  are attained in short time intervals. The behavior of matter is  very difficult to predict under these conditions.    Moreover, when you're talking about weapons, every step  requires careful and thorough checking. If you look backward  once again and attempt to determine how many useless and  unnecessary experiments there were, their number is very small.  But they also were necessary in order to understand how to move  forward.    Gubarev: Probably it was pleasing for the  experimenter to say: Dear Academicians Sakharov and Zeldovich,  were you mistaken?    Chernyshev: This is a natural reaction... But it  was far more pleasant when together with the theoreticians you  make your way toward the truth. I had the satisfaction of  working with both Andrey Dmitriyevich Sakharov and Igor  Yevgenyevich Tamm. And I keep only bright impressions from these  meetings.    Incidentally, when the first experiments with magnetic  commulation were discussed with both Sakharov and Tamm they very  naturally and simply sensed what was not understood. Andrey  Dmitriyevich frequently repeated: ``Let's think together!'' He  was a very magnetic personality, he understood us and discussed  any problems as equals. And new ideas and new experiments took  shape. Thus it was, for example, in the development of magnetic  flux generators.    Gubarev: Was an idea of Sakharov the basis for the  present-day experiment?    Chernyshev: Andrey Dmitriyevich proposed the idea  of magnetic commulation in 1951.    Gubarev: Pardon me for interrupting, but in  ordinary terms what is ``magnetic commulation''?    Chernyshev: This is the compression of a magnetic  flux in a circuit by means of external forces. Some of the  energy is transformed into magnetic field energy, and as a  result of circuit compression the current sharply increases,  which makes it possible to use such devices as generators of  superpowerful magnetic fields. In this field great successes  were attained by the now deceased Academician Aleksandr  Ivanovich Pavlovskiy. In these same devices it is possible to  obtain great supplies of energy and high flux densities during  short time intervals.    In 1951 Sakharov stated that in principle it is possible to  use magnetic commulation for producing a thermonuclear burst. To  me this thought was very attractive. However, it was necessary  to overcome enormous difficulties. Although during the first ten  years some apparatus appeared, it already was clear that in  order to produce a thermonuclear burst the power had to be  increased a hundredfold. I had the idea of a disk explosively  driven magnetic field generator and it began to take shape in  1961.    Over the course of some time we were the only ones who had  this technology. Our results were reported for the first time at  an international conference in 1983. Unfortunately, attempts of  American researchers to achieve the same results were not  crowned with success. Naturally, in the report we did not give  what is related to ``know-how.'' Thus, ten years have passed and  now the Americans are undertaking energetic attempts to achieve  that which we attained in 1983.    Gubarev: How do you explain their lag?    Chernyshev: Several factors. It seems to me that  the Russian research was more innovative, because, however  paradoxical it may seem, they worked under more difficult  conditions. It is no secret that good outfitting with personal  computers enables Americans to make many calculations and  determinations, but at the same time ``slows down'' the  development of thought.    Gubarev: It is clear what cooperation gives to the  Americans. But what advantage is there to you?    Chernyshev: First of all, we understand the level  at which they are. We are adopting a number of methods which we  did not know of earlier and most importantly, are solving many  thermonuclear synthesis problems. Indeed, even such a rich  country as the United States by itself, without broad  international cooperation, is not capable of solving this  problem.    Gubarev: I propose such a project. We detonate a  nuclear charge, transform the energy in your generator, direct  it into a beaker filled with water, obtain a thermonuclear  burst, and then direct this enormous energy to an electric power  plant. The scheme seems so elementary, so what is fallacious  about it?    Chernyshev: The fact that in the very first stage  you use a fission reaction. Our task, however, is to obtain  "clean energy." It is assumed that superpowerful magnetic  generators will be used as the triggering device. In these  generators it is the energy of an explosion, not the energy of  fission, which is the operative agent; then a system is  triggered in which there also is no fissionable materials and as  a result of synthesis we obtain energy, some of which will be  used for the next thermonuclear cycle and all the rest is  directed for the needs of people.    Gubarev: Thus, the Americans nevertheless were  doubtful in the first stage?    Chernyshev: This was related to the successes in  developing explosively driven magnetic field generators. The  history of their development dates way back. The first abstracts  were submitted to an international conference as early as 1965.  Andrey Dmitriyevich Sakharov even then insisted that Pavlovskiy  and I without fail go to the conference and tell about our  successes in this field. And here then began a game of ``leap  frog'' with the trip, since after all we worked at a secret  center. First they told us: ``Go!'', but after a month had  passed it was ``No, don't go!''    Finally, Aleksandr Ivanovich and I were called to Moscow for  formalization of the passports and there again it was ``yes,''  then ``no.'' Finally Pavlovskiy and I became weary of all this,  climbed into an aircraft and flew off to Arzamas-16. And our  interests at the conference were represented at the conference  by Sergey Petrovich Kapitsa. On his return he stated that our  reports were very greatly anticipated there, interest was  enormous and our results made a very strong impression on the  Americans.    There was still another conference in Washington in 1979. We  also presented a series of reports there. And again they did not  allow us to go and therefore the Americans asked with interest:  ``If we come to Russia will we still not be able to meet up with  the authors?'' Unfortunately, the answer of our specialists was  evasive... And therefore the Americans concluded that  ``Pavlovskiy and Chernyshev'' did not exist and therefore when  we appeared before them for the first time they were exceedingly  surprised. Since 1983 we have already been regularly meeting  with our American colleagues and such contacts are enabling us  to learn better not only about one another, but also about the  essence of that problem which we are solving together.    Gubarev: What were your impressions of Los Alamos?    Chernyshev: I was there twice. Both centers--Los  Alamos and ours--somehow are very similar to one another. There  is a special aura which prevails in both places. The strong  sense of being cut off from the rest of the world. The very same  system of passes and being photographed. And at the same time  the creative atmosphere of scientific research. The Americans,  the same as ourselves, are inspired in their work, are proud of  it... We speak in different languages but our thoughts and  actions are similar, very close. And therefore we so easily  understand one another.    Gubarev: And you did not have the sensation that  you were on the different side of a barricade? They made weapons  in order to annihilate us and you made weapons to annihilate  them?    Chernyshev: I think that you yourself can answer  this question... It was a pleasure for us to confirm that the  team of specialists gathered at Arzamas-16 in no way is inferior  to that which worked beyond the ocean. And that we were capable  of solving not only the same, but also even more complex  problems. The sensation that you work in such a strong institute  as ours was pleasant, I won't downplay that! I have been in many  scientific institutes and at large scientific centers: in  Moscow, at Leningrad, in the Urals and in Siberia, and I have  always felt that our institute was for me.    Gubarev: I'd like to ask a more direct question:  do you not regret that you have spent your entire life working  on nuclear weapons?    Chernyshev: That was the duty of the times and I  had to engage in it.    Gubarev: Do you feel that weapons work advanced  different branches of physics and thereby facilitated the  development of science in general?    Chernyshev: To be sure. Work on military projects  always is carried out at the level of the latest advances. And  without question there also is a payoff for all related fields.  But at the same time each of us had the conviction that mankind  would find sufficient common sense never to put nuclear weapons  to use.    Gubarev: You were at the tests? What were your  sensations?    Chernyshev: Mixed feelings. But one feeling  nevertheless predominated. It was necessary that this weapon  never be used. That was the principal conclusion.    Gubarev: What were your impressions from work with  the Americans?    Chernyshev: It was important that such contacts be  made strictly on an equal basis. If the arrangement is set up in  that way everything is taken with understanding and respect. And  honesty is necessary: this is possible and impossible.    Gubarev: The first experiment was behind you. What  then?    Chernyshev: The Americans are proposing a program  for the next two years. This is research on the physics of  magnetized plasma. We are very interested in using American  diagnostics, which in some respects is superior to ours. They  have better computer resources and because of this--better  processing of the results.    But at the same they have shortcomings. They, I repeat, are  ``loaded down'' with computers and therefore they don't want to  think a little without having recourse to them. ``So there is no  bad without good''; in this case some advantages appeared for  us. The joint program on our theme is definite and clear for the  coming years.    Gubarev: For example, the "thermonuclear  satellite." And what place is occupied by "tokamaks"?    Chernyshev: I regularly visited the Atomic Energy  Institute. Even at the time when the work was headed by Lev  Andreyevich Artsimovich. And even then it seemed to me that this  path not only was long, but also very expensive. Even if you  bear in mind that our ``boublik'' would be five meters in  diameter and with a cross section of about a meter, it can be  counted on only as an approximation, an approach to ignition of  the "thermonuclear satellite," and in order to obtain it the  dimensions must be increased by an order of magnitude -- by a  factor of ten!    A structure of cyclonic dimensions is obtained. It requires  investments of more than one billion dollars. It is impossible  for any individual country to realize such a project by itself  and therefore different countries are cooperating. The entire  approach is based on the prolonged containment of plasma. This  is a very long-term and costly program. True, this is a  stationary system in which the plasma will burn a long time.    To be sure, a great many problems appear which are related  to  the instabilities of plasma, its thrusting onto walls, cooling,  etc. And therefore for those who in their spirit feel closer to  pulsed systems an apparatus of such a type has no appeal.    Gubarev: What about lasers?    Chernyshev: These systems are as complex as the  tokamak. There must be careful regulation of each beam. Should  an earthquake occur anywhere an adjustment must be made and  therefore there is a need for some kind of floating platform,  etc. There also other kinds of apparatus which are equally  complex and expensive. And each of them requires powerful energy  sources and they exceed the power of all electric power plants  on the planet by many times...    However, the systems which we proposed--I have in mind  explosively driven magnetic field generators--make it possible  to achieve ignition and even a demonstration experiment far more  simply and less expensively. And indeed, before investing  billions of dollars in a laser ``thermonuclear satellite,'' in  an apparatus with ion beams, it must be understood: suddenly  some restrictions show up which we do not suspect today! The  results of experiments, as well as calculations, show that  explosively driven magnetic field generators are the shortest  path to obtaining ignition.    Fortunately, many American colleagues also share such a  point  of view... Once we told of our research, the course of our  investigations, to Academicians Khariton, Velikhov and  Aleksandrov. They insisted that we continue to work because if  success comes it will be equal to the breakthrough into space.  That's what they said...    They supported us very strongly, but now the events of  recent  years have exerted an influence on our work and has slowed it  down. But a skeleton of specialists for the time being remains  and this is very important--all are enthusiastic, they  understand that a breakthrough into a fundamentally new field of  science and technical progress is possible. This is a noble  objective. I think that our mission will be accomplished if we  come closer to the long-cherished dream that gives meaning to  our life and work.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Stagecoach pays Pounds 8m for Scottish bus holding Stagecoach, the UK's largest bus group, yesterday announ-ced its eighth acquisition of 1994, with the Pounds 8.3m purchase of a 20 per cent stake in SBH, the holding company for Strathclyde Buses, Scotland's leading bus operator, writes Simon Davies. Stagecoach will pay Pounds 1.5m cash, with the remainder in new shares. In addition, it is to sell SBH 18 new buses, which Stagecoach had previously considered using on new routes in Glasgow in direct competition with its new partner. Mr Derek Scott, finance director, said: 'We have made no secret of the fact that we need to be in the major urban areas of Britain.' He said the SBH tie-up could open the way for a larger stake at a later stage, but that SBH might alternatively consider a flotation, providing a potentially profitable exit for Stagecoach. SBH was formed from a management buy-out from Strathclyde Council in 1993, and it recently expanded through the Pounds 11.3m purchase of Kelvin Central Buses, a large competitor in Glasgow, creating a group with Pounds 86m annual turnover. The group owns 1,330 vehicles and employs 3,700 staff. SBH said it approached Stagecoach, as it was looking to raise capital from the sale of a minority stake, so that it could compete with the larger listed groups while retaining independence. However, the Office of Fair Trading said it would look into the deal, given Stage-coach's position as Scotland's third largest bus operator. There is an ongoing OFT inquiry into the SBH takeover of Kelvin.</p>

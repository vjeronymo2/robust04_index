			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 92, SHE DEFEATS LIABILITY CLAIM ON HOME, SAVINGS  </P> <P> A 92-year-old woman won her legal fight to save her home and life savings  Tuesday with a court settlement that effectively overturned a 1987 jury verdict  that held her liable for an accident caused by her great-nephew after she  loaned him money to buy a car.  </P> <P> Under the 1987 verdict, reached on the first day of a negligence trial, Luella  Wilson stood to lose her home in North Bennington and her savings of about  $950,000.  </P> <P> But shortly after noon Tuesday, Wilson received a telephone call from her  lawyer. "You've won, Luella. You can keep your land, and we have won the case,"  he was quoted as saying.  </P> <P> None of the parties to the case would disclose details of the settlement.  Sitting at her kitchen table, drinking a shot of whiskey, Wilson said she was  happy to win.  </P> <P> "I don't feel very damned good. I can't walk, but I did win," she said.  </P> <P> In 1984 Wilson loaned Willard Stuart the money to buy a car, despite his poor  driving record and lack of a driver's license.  </P> <P> Shortly after that, Stuart drove the car off a bridge after drinking beer and  whiskey and smoking marijuana with a group of young men. One of his companions,  Mark Vince, was in the back seat during the accident and was seriously injured.  He later had one leg amputated.  </P> <P> Vince sued Wilson. A jury found her liable in 1987 and ordered her to pay Vince  $950,000.  </P> <P> Although refusing to reverse the 1987 decision on appeal, the Vermont Supreme  Court ruled that a jury should decide if Ace Auto of Bennington and its  president and salesman in the deal, Gary Gardner, should share the liability  for selling the car to Stuart.  </P> <P> In opening arguments at the trial Tuesday morning, Wilson's lawyer, Frederick  Harlow, told jurors that Vince, not Wilson, must bear the blame for the fact he  is mostly paralyzed and has lost a leg.  </P></p>

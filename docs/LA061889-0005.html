			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I enjoyed "I Know My First Name Is Steven," the TV movie about Steven Stayner,  not only because it was emotionally touching but because instead of finishing  with a storybook happy ending, as many movies do, it dealt with the hard and  painful problems he had to face once he returned home. In fact, the problems he  had to deal with once he was home again were almost as difficult as when he was  a "captive," as he was not only cruelly teased but had to get used to living an  entirely new life style.  </P> <P> Kenneth L.

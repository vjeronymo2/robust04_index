			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MIKE PENNER: REESE: WORK OF ART AT 85  </P> <P> The nicest man to ever wear an Angel uniform got a terrible scare Tuesday  night.  </P> <P> Jimmie Reese, roommate to Babe Ruth, best friend to Nolan Ryan, somewhat older  brother to Jim Abbott and fungo master to the world, sat in his Westwood  apartment clutching a hand to his 85-year-old chest.  </P> <P> Jimmie had just finished listening to the radio broadcast of that evening's  Angel game in Baltimore and the news had been good. The Angels won, 7-1, and  Abbott pitched seven strong innings for his first victory of the season. Abbott  and Reese are tight -- a March-November kinship if there ever was one -- and a  dentist friend named Norman Kumai phoned Jimmie to celebrate.  </P> <P> Soon, the conversation shifted to how Jimmie was feeling. Jimmie said not so  good. He told Kumai about these pains in his chest and within minutes, Kumai  was in his car, headed first to Jimmie's apartment and then to St. John's  Hospital in Santa Monica.  </P> <P> According to doctors, Jimmie had suffered a coronary occlusion. To you and me,  that's not much different than a heart attack. Jimmie had a blocked blood  vessel leading to his heart and to unblock it, Dr. Harry Rockoff performed an  emergency angioplasty, which entails the insertion and inflation of a miniature  balloon into the vessel.  </P> <P> Four days later, Jimmie is listed in stable condition and resting comfortably  at St. John's. But the Angels say Reese will be sidelined through the All-Star  break, which will be the longest they've been fungo-less since 1972, when they  added Reese, then a tadpole of 63, to their coaching staff.  </P> <P> For the past 18 seasons, Jimmie has held the official title of Angel  conditioning coach. For most of the 1980s, that was good for a laugh. During  those years, the annual Freeway Series was played between the Dodgers and the  codgers, when the Angels had a graying nucleus of Rod Carew-Bobby Grich-Reggie  Jackson and a motto: Never start anyone under 30.  </P> <P> Were those Angels old?  </P> <P> Hey, their conditioning coach was pushing 80.  </P> <P> Jimmie laughed along and lasted longer than any of them. He was there when  Frank Tanana broke in. He was there when Abbott broke in. He has hit fungoes to  Andy Messersmith. He has hit fungoes to Mark Langston.  </P> <P> Jimmie has spent 73 seasons in professional baseball and not many of them got  much better than 1989. Last summer, the Angels hosted the All-Star Game, which  meant Jimmie could throw out the first pitch and spend one more day on the same  side with Ryan. It was a 10-year reunion, the all-time major league strikeout  leader and the man after whom he named a son: Reese Ryan.  </P> <P> Last summer also introduced Reese to Abbott, the one-handed pitcher who  followed in Ryan's footsteps -- straight to Jimmie's locker. They are the  oldest and youngest Angels, separated by more than 60 years, but they are bound  by what they mean to the sport. Tim Mead, the team's publicity director, had  his picture taken with the two Jims and calls it his prized possession. "They  both stand for so much," Mead says. "Jimmie shows what the elderly can do and  Jim shows that those born without everything are still capable of anything."  </P> <P> The photo hangs in Mead's office, along with several others, all framed by  Reese. Jimmie is good with wood, be it half a bat or four pieces of varnished  walnut, and picture-framing has been a longtime hobby.  </P> <P> Jimmie estimates he has made more than 20,000 frames for friends over the  years. "He's very insulted when he sees something on your wall framed by Aaron  Bros.," Mead jokes.  </P> <P> Sometimes, friends turn the trick on Jimmie. Because of the 100-mile drive  between Anaheim and Westwood, Jimmie spends Angel home stands at the Jolly  Roger Inn across the street from Disneyland. There, in the hotel lobby, is one  of Jimmie's Angel jerseys, old No. 50, framed and on display.  </P> <P> The hotel also has named one of its largest suites "The Jimmie Reese Room" and  offers a menu that features "The Jimmie Reese Breakfast." The main course?  Oatmeal, Jimmie's daily morning standby.  </P> <P> At 85, Jimmie is a man of routine. He's set in his ways. Before every Angel  home game, for instance, just as batting practice concludes, he refuses to join  the rest of the team in the clubhouse. Instead, he shuffles down the left field  line and mingles with the fans, signing autographs, posing for photos, patting  toddlers on the head.  </P> <P> Jimmie likes everyone. Even sportswriters. Last season, this one was working on  a Ryan profile, so Jimmie was an obvious source. Jimmie compared Ryan to Walter  Johnson -- he's an eye witness to both -- and he reeled in all the memories,  including the game in which Ryan threw 170 pitches and won, 2-1.  </P> <P> Interview finished, I turned to leave but Jimmie wouldn't allow it. He pulled a  cardboard box out of his locker stall, opened it and said, "Reach in."  </P> <P> I pulled out a baseball. It was signed by Ryan.  </P> <P> "Keep it," Jimmie said. "I've got lots of them."  </P> <P> Right now, Jimmie isn't quite up to receiving visitors or phone calls, but St.  John's will pass along cards and letters. The address is 1328 22nd Street,  Santa Monica, 90404. The patient is one of a kind.  </P> <P> The Angels won't be the same until he's back on the active roster. They want  him at full strength, fungo in hand, the picture of good health.  </P> <P> Suitable for framing.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAGIC, HEARN CHARGED WITH WRONG RESPONSE TO ARREST OF WORTHY  </P> <P> I hope I'm not the first to advocate fairness in our consideration of James  Worthy. A man's own conscience is generally sufficient judge, jury and sentence  in a publicized occurrence of this kind.  </P> <P> This particular event could have been handled privately and not subjected to  the public domain were it not for the media's thirst for denigrating trivia.  </P> <P> SAM HAVER, Burbank  </P></p>

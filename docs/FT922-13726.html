			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / World Trade News: German export credit policy to be reformed GERMANY'S uniform export credit insurance rate is likely to be replaced by the end of the year. A new system, involving at least five different premium rates, will make it more expensive for German exporters to insure contracts in risky countries, but cheaper in low-risk countries. Germany has for many years been alone in providing exporters with a standard premium rate. It has drawn criticism from exporters from other countries, who complain that German exporters win an unfair advantage in competition for contracts in risky third world countries. 'We accept that we cannot maintain (the standard rate) any more,' the finance ministry said yesterday. 'There is a good case that we are making it too difficult for exporters to win good risk business, while at the same time attracting bad-risk contracts.' Other pressure on Bonn has come from efforts inside the European Community and the OECD to harmonise the terms on which countries provide export credit cover. The ministry emphasised that details of the new system, which will be operated on the government's behalf by the Hamburg-based Hermes as at present, have yet to be worked out. It will aim to reflect both country risk and risk linked to particular buyers. Neither the number of different rates, nor the spread between the cheapest and most expensive, has yet been decided. 'The single-rate system has its advantages, and that is why it has survived so long,' an official said. 'For exporters to risky countries, the advantage is obvious. For the government, it avoided the need for difficult decisions about political situations in different countries.' The change comes at a time of increasing anxiety over Germany's exposure to possible non-payment on many contracts in the former Soviet Union. Official export credit cover amounts to about DM29bn (Pounds 10bn), but is larger if direct aid and uncovered contracts are taken into account. Germany has in recent years faced a widening gap between premium income and payments made for contracts that go bad. Its accumulated deficit is about DM12bn, according to the finance ministry.</p>

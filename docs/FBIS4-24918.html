			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, June 5 (XINHUA) -- The planned Geneva peace  talks on cease-fire in Bosnia were canceled today because of a  controversy over the presence of Serb troops around the town of  Gorazde, according to a U.N. Spokesman.    After four days of debate here over the presence of Serb  troops in the U.N. exclusion zone around Gorazde, Yasushi  Akashi, the U.N. envoy to the former Yugoslavia, was preparing  to return to his headquarters, Akashi's spokesman told reporters.    "There will be no talks or meetings here in the Palais de  Nations this afternoon. We will be returning now to our hotels  and making arrangements to return to Zagreb," Spokesman Michael  Williams said.    The planned talks were to have begun on Thursday [2 June],  but were postponed because a few dozen armed Serbs were reported  still to be in the three-kilometer zone, as a result of which  Bosnian Muslim leaders announced a boycott.    During the next two days, the U.N. applied pressure on  Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to withdraw the remaining  troops from the zone immediately and salvage the peace talks.    The U.N. peacekeepers then declared that there were no armed  Serbs remaining in the zone, but later announced that some were  indeed still present in the western portion of the zone.    Williams said Akashi had received assurances from Karadzic  that U.N. peacekeepers could take over the Serb position in the  zone and had invited vice-president of the Muslim-led Bosnian  Government, Ejup Ganic, to the talks.    But shortly afterwards, the spokesman announced that Ganic  had announced a boycott and the talks were canceled.    Reports quoted Bosnian Government sources as saying that  Ganic will send Akashi a letter explaining his government's  reasons for not entering the negotiations while armed Serbs  remain around Gorazde.    The talks between Serbs, Muslims and Croats were intended to  establish a total cease-fire in Bosnia and represent the latest  move by the international community to bring an end to the  two-year-old civil war which has claimed some 200,000 lives in  the former Yugoslav republic.    Earlier last week, the Muslim-led government in Bosnia said  it would not attend the peace talks unless the Serbs withdrew  their troops from around Gorazde.</p>

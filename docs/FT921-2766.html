			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Band/Midland Bank: Not easy to combine investment sides MAKING SENSE of the combined treasury and investment banking activities of Midland and Hongkong Bank will not be easy. Each bank has recently taken steps to rationalise its own operations in these areas, with different results. Hongkong Bank, for instance, has moved its fixed income business out of James Capel and into the parent bank to sit alongside the treasury activities. Midland, on the other hand, maintains both businesses in Midland Montagu - though it has recently moved most of its corporate banking business out of its investment banking subsidiary into the parent bank, in part as a result of the effect on Midland Montagu's balance sheet of its deteriorating loan book. These activities are likely to be combined globally, either within a merged parent or at one step removed, as at Midland Montagu. The banks maintain between them a litter of different brand names, reflecting their piecemeal move into investment banking and their failure to integrate their respective businesses in this area - Midland Montagu, Samuel Montagu and Greenwell on the Midland side, for instance, and James Capel and Wardley on the Hongkong Bank side.</p>

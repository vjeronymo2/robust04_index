			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Japanese banks step up action to rescue Kumagai: Second top executive is transferred to restructure ailing property group THE Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan will send the head of its London branch back to Tokyo to oversee the restructuring of international operations at Kumagai Gumi, the Japanese contractor and property developer, burdened by about Y700bn (Pounds 4.1bn) in debt. LTCB's move follows the transfer of an executive at Sumitomo Bank to assist in the restructuring of Kumagai's domestic operations, hurt by the collapse of Japanese property prices and by its own financial exposure to unsuccessful resort developments. The joint effort by the two leading Japanese banks highlights the seriousness of the situation at Kumagai, which has struggled in domestic and international markets to meet a goal, set last year, of selling Y300bn in properties over five years to reduce its debt. Mr Yasunori Fujii, general manager of LTCB's London branch, is expected to return to Japan at the end of this week and be formally appointed senior managing director of Kumagai, responsible for international business, at a board meeting next month. LTCB officials said the bank has become involved because it backed some of Kumagai's ventures and has a small shareholding in the company, which had an envied reputation in the Japanese industry in the 1980s as a successful international contractor. But the company has begun to retreat from the international market, and over the past three years overseas receipts have fallen from 25 per cent to 8 per cent of sales. Kumagai has already been forced to sell cherished assets, including a self-developed office complex in Reading, Berkshire, sold in late March for a reported Y7.7bn. It has also raised funds by reducing a stake in the increasingly independent Kumagai Gumi (Hong Kong), which is particularly successful in the Chinese market. Three years ago, Kumagai had a 35 per cent stake in the Hong Kong company, but that will be reduced to just over 6 per cent under an agreement announced last month. The transfer of bank staff is the preferred Japanese method of restructuring an ailing company, as it sends a clear signal to other creditors that the banks have no intention of allowing the company in question to collapse. However, the lead banks are expected to accept a reduction in interest payments on their own exposure to the troubled company. Kumagai has been more vulnerable than other Japanese contractors because of its strategy of taking an active role in the venture financing. The company has also suffered because of close links to the Shuwa property and stock speculation group, which is also being restructured.</p>

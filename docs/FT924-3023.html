			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Delors the Euro-militant praises the British - This is a chance to end the smouldering crisis says EC president IT WAS supposed to be a tour d'horizon, but Mr Jacques Delors' pre-summit press conference turned out to be a tour de force, writes Lionel Barber in Brussels. In vintage form, the European Commission President yesterday displayed the combination of intellect and passion which still makes him a force to be reckoned with when it comes to the future of the EC. 'I am a militant European,' he declared in response to a questioner who dared ask whether the Danish rejection of Maastricht and the resulting currency turmoil meant that the process of closer European integration had reached its high water-mark. 'I hope the process of European construction will continue ..there is no third way between survival and decline.' Mr Delors set out the stakes for the leaders and citizens of the EC on the eve of the Edinburgh summit. It was, he said, a chance to end the smouldering crisis of recent months. He urged member states to rally behind the so-called Delors II package which calls for an increase in the Community budget by the end of the decade well above a counter-proposal put forward by the UK presidency. Without proper future funding, the EC would risk a retreat into an ivory tower, he said. It would turn its back on 70m people in the EC's poorer rural regions, emasculate the research budget needed to improve European competitiveness, and kill off hopes of making the Community a serious player on the global stage, particularly in efforts to help the former communist countries in eastern Europe. 'At one extreme,' he warned, 'by the year 2000, you could just have a large single market, anaemic common policies, and just a cheque-writing operation for the poorer members. That is not acceptable.' Mr Delors said it was wrong to accept 'mediocre commitments' from member states with 'short-term budgetary problems' - a side-swipe at Germany, the traditional paymaster in the EC which has taken a tougher line as a result of the huge costs of unification. But Mr Delors remained by and large a team player. He praised the UK draft on the Danish question as 'extremely subtle', and he signalled support for early talks on enlargement with Austria, Finland, Sweden, and possibly Norway, next year - on condition that a budget deal was reached and Denmark and the UK ratified the Maastricht treaty by summer 1993. Reuter adds: EC officials yesterday urged Mr Delors to press EC leaders to step up the fight against racism and neo-Nazi aggression in Europe. EC inaction was helping to increase neo-Nazi violence against immigrant and other minority groups and desecration of places of worship and cemeteries, an open letter to Mr Delors signed by more than 2,500 civil servants said. 'The fight against these actions is not being led with the necessary determination. This constitutes an indirect encouragement for these neo-Nazi groups,' they said.</p>

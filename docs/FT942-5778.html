			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (15): Erring on the side of caution - Profile, David Shaw Sterling's undignified exit from the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) in September 1992 was the catalyst for Legal and General revising its approach to currency management, says David Shaw, head of strategy. Sterling's 14-15 per cent decline 'brought home to us just how exposed our assets, and by extension our policy holders, had been.' He adds that 'such events are becoming increasingly common and institutions like L&amp;G need to assess the risks and take appropriate action'. Institutional investors are among the more cautious creatures found on foreign exchanges. So Mr Shaw is quick to stress that the discretion he is allowed by his board and trustees is tightly constrained. At the level of currency selection only two sizes of position are allowed: the minimum position is 2.5 per cent, and this has to be justified by an expected total return on the preferred currency of at least 7.5 per cent. The maximum permitted position is 5 per cent of underlying assets, with an expected total return of 15 per cent. 'No conviction, no bets,' he says. Five per cent may not sound much, but can add up to large numbers when one considers that L&amp;G has more than Pounds 30bn assets under management, of which about 20 per cent is in non-sterling assets. Across the breadth of UK institutional investors, nearly Pounds 250bn is probably invested in non-sterling securities. Mr Shaw stresses that these large bets are rare. In 1993 L&amp;G did not take any 5 per cent positions, and only placed one 2.5 per cent position on the dollar, which paid off. This year has proved tricky. Mr Shaw is in good company when he admits that L&amp;G had a bet on the dollar against the yen which went wrong. The group was saved from embarrassment by placing a stop-loss order at Y107.50, which minimised the loss to 2 per cent. While the 2.5 and 5 per cent limits are very rigid compared to many other currency trading operations, they still represent a considerable change in modus operandi from the situation just two years ago. 'The asset allocation view was initially (taken) without any serious assessment of the relative attractiveness of the currencies involved,' says Shaw. Partly this reflected trustees' concern that managers not be seen to be too pro-active in their management of currencies. It was also a function of the relatively low currency volatility since October 1990 when sterling had formally entered the ERM. Now the group does one-year currency forecasts, roughly consistent with its typical investment time horizon. The focus is on the four main currencies - dollar, D-Mark, yen and sterling - and each month L&amp;G uses fundamental economic analysis to rank the currencies in terms of expected performance. With about 80 per cent of group assets in the UK, the key is the sterling cross with the other three currencies. The degree of discretion in managing currency exposure is an ongoing subject of internal debate. An important concern from a taxation perspective is to be classified as an investor, not a trader - a fine distinction which turns on investment time horizons. Overall, says Mr Shaw, 'there is an increasing willingness on the part of trustees to be more flexible in allowing currency management'. There is, however, a job of persuasion to be done. Some trustees are financial ingenues, who need to be persuaded that currency management is not speculation, while others, for example, will feel that selling sterling is in some way unpatriotic. With trustees more willing, the currency decision is now increasingly separated from the underlying asset decision, says Mr Shaw, 'because the economic fundamentals that drive currencies are not the same set that drive the bond and equity markets'. The decisions are taken 'separately but simultaneously'. While progress has been made, Mr Shaw is careful to stress that they have not reached the stage where, like hedge funds, proprietary traders or currency funds, they purely take a view on a currency. 'What we do is currency management, and it is the currency management of an underlying asset,' he stresses. A concern that Mr Shaw expresses is that just as investment managers are mastering currency management, the game seems to be changing. 'We've padded up for the village cricket match to find we're playing in the World Series,' he quips. The worry is that the advent of highly leveraged trading, conducted mostly by proprietary traders and hedge funds, may have fundamentally changed that nature of markets in a way which renders the more cautious strategies of institutional investors both anachronistic and inadequate. This concern was heightened by the volatility of financial markets during the first quarter which left many fund managers with red faces. It is early days yet. The first quarter may be a one-off, in which case it can be ignored. Otherwise, Mr Shaw may find himself having to manage his currency exposure as actively as he manages the underlying assets.</p>

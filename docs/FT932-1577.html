			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Business and the Environment: Too much of a good thing - Ariane Genillard describes how Germany's national recycling scheme is collapsing under its own success Every day for a year Margot von Shad carefully picked her rubbish apart, setting aside the cans, cartons, packaging and other household products marked with a green dot to put in yellow rubbish bins in front of her house. But last Sunday she decided, along with some friends, that it was a waste of time. 'All this effort and now we hear it is for nothing,' she says disappointedly. Along with millions of other conscientious Germans, she is dismayed by reports that the country's waste collecting and recycling scheme is going bankrupt. The scheme, known as Duales System Deutschland (DSD), is collapsing under the weight of the rubbish it is collecting and sorting out. DSD was set up last year by 600 industrial groups to meet government-imposed recycling quotas, but last week it announced that it needs DM500m (Pounds 200m) just to keep going. Part of the problem is the scheme's success. For plastics alone, DSD expects to collect this year four times the amount it was set up to deal with. At the weekend, Klaus Topfer, the federal environment minister who devised the scheme, proudly referred to his fellow Germans as the '(trash) collectors of the world'. But Topfer's compliment is hardly soothing the worries of both an environment-conscious public and German industry. DSD's ability to recycle waste lags well behind its success in collecting it. With dumping sites filling up and scandals over waste exports increasingly surfacing, politicians and industrialists are now under pressure to rethink the entire system. Some critics have taken action. Last week, the Rhineland Palatinate state withdrew from the scheme. As one official in the local environment ministry put it: 'We are suffocating under mountains of DSD waste and we have no more storage for it.' But retail traders have been the loudest in voicing their fears. If DSD fails to collect household waste, it will be legally bound to take back packaging from its customers. DSD collects and sorts out waste from 96 per cent of German households. It was established in response to the ground-breaking 1991 packaging law which forced manufacturers and retailers to take packaging back. Other European countries such as Austria and France, eager to find solutions for the ever-increasing production of household waste, have since been taking a close look at the German law and its application. At the core of the nationwide scheme lies the German concept of Kreislaufwirtschaft - a closed circle economy where all products are re-used ad infinitum. The ultimate aim is to have industry manufacture products that offer viable recycling possibilities. To implement such a goal, industry must bear the financial costs of recycling, environmentalists say. Under the packaging law, manufacturers and retailers are responsible for collecting and recycling packaging products. The law effectively shifted waste management away from cash-strapped municipalities to the private sector. Faced with the cost of both collecting and recycling their own products, industry will have an incentive to manufacture environment-friendly products, Topfer hopes. But in practice, the system contains a major flaw, which many anti-DSD environmentalists are now quick to point out. The entire scheme is based on the assumption that there are cost advantages in manufacturing products that can be easily recycled. But in the case of plastic, the largest packaging product on the market, recycling may be economically less viable than 'down-cycling' - destroying the product through methods such as incineration. Unlike glass, aluminium and paper, which have been recycled for decades, plastic packaging such as yoghurt pots and beverage bottles are of little value to recyclers. They contain different colourings and are usually made of mixed elements. 'The industry has known for years that heavy investments would be needed to recycle plastics. The bottom line is that they are only interested in the plastics leaving the market in an orderly fashion, no matter what their destinations are,' says Franz-Joseph Fraundorfer, from the German-based office of consultants Arthur D Little. In 1993, DSD expects to collect nearly 400,000 tonnes of the 1.2m tonnes of plastics produced annually in the country. But recycling capacity in Germany stands at just 124,000 tonnes. However, a further 152,000 tonnes will be exported. In response to a scandal last year in France, where German waste was found sitting in the open air on a badly controlled landfill, DSD has set up a system to test the viability of recycling companies abroad. Many cases slip through DSD's net, says Greenpeace, the environmental group. Only last March Greenpeace claimed to have found thousands of tonnes of DSD waste in Indonesia, despite an Indonesian government ban on waste imports brought in last November to curb the flow of waste entering the country. 'DSD even pays foreign firms to take back plastics, which are then put on empty ships returning to Asia from German ports,' a consultant says. Part of the solution lies in Germany developing its own recycling facilities. But investments in plastic recycling, which are costly and involve lengthy research, are dragging behind. RWE, for instance, the big west German utilities company, has invested DM10m in a pilot plant to separate aluminium from polyethylene used in manufacturing beverage cartons. If that is successful, a permanent plant could recycle up to 10,000 tonnes of such cartons a year. But that would be less than a quarter of the 60,000 tonnes a year on the market. Overall, RWE expects to be able to recycle 40,000 tonnes of plastic this year. By 1996 the utilities group hopes to have a recycling capacity nearing 200,000 tonnes. Veba, the energy group and Ruhrkohle, the coal producer, are also working together to recycle 40,000 tonnes of plastic a year by melting it down and using the resulting oil in an oil refinery. However, such recycling technology is limited to large plants that are coupled with a refinery. Such recycling efforts pale in the light of the 800,000 tonnes of plastic that DSD is legally bound to recycle starting in July 1995. Worried about how it will deal with all that waste, the company has been calling out to the chemical industry to start investing in recycling facilities. But as a director from Bayer, the chemical group, puts it: 'We are all losing money. Where do they think we will find it for such non-productive investments?' Consultants instead argue that 'recycling at all cost' may simply not be the best approach. 'France, for instance, has developed incineration techniques which are technically and environmentally very effective,' Fraundorfer says. Meanwhile, household waste collected by DSD can no longer be legally burned or dumped on landfills and is accumulating in temporary storages. Politicians from Germany's opposition Social Democratic party say the law should be changed and plastics, for example, taxed. But Topfer refuses to renege on the packaging law. 'If industry is forced to assume the cost of recycling and invest,' says an official from the federal environment ministry, 'then they will change their plastic packaging to something else.'</p>

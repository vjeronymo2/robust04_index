			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Local councils to meet costs of reorganisation All the costs created by local government reorganisation in England must be borne locally, the Department of the Environment said yesterday. County councils claimed this would mean higher council taxes in the areas affected. The costs of reorganisation, which would involve replacing the current two-tier system of counties and districts with new all-purpose unitary authorities, are fiercely disputed. Sir John Banham, chairman of the Local Government Commission, which is preparing recommendations for the government on new structures, has estimated total costs at about Pounds 1bn. Under the plans announced yesterday, councils will be allowed to borrow to cover the transitional costs of the reorganisation, due to take place in 1996 and 1997, but central government will pay no grants to local authorities to cover the costs. Ministers are putting pressure on local authorities to minimise costs by restricting councils' borrowing to cover for only 'unavoidable costs and for a reasonable amount of discretionary expenditure'. Their intention is that this will thwart any rises in council tax. Councils which spend more than the government deems 'reasonable' on reorganisation will have to find money from reserves. The Labour-controlled Association of County Councils, most of whose members support retaining the two-tier system, said the decision meant 'people in some parts of the country will be paying for the reorganisation into the next century, long after the review process has been completed'. Ms Josie Farrington, the association's chairman, said: 'The irony is that the proposed system of financing changes is drawn up in such a way to ensure that the government - which has foisted the review upon local communities with no convincing explanation - dictates that the local taxpayer foots the bill.' She said the distinction between unavoidable costs and discretionary costs was 'no more than a cynical attempt to make local authorities look responsible for the inevitable rise in council tax bills'. However, the cross-party Association of District Councils, which supports the creation of unitary authorities, gave the proposals a 'guarded welcome'. It predicted that long-term savings generated by removing a tier of bureaucracy would enable the new unitary authorities to pass on savings to council tax payers. It said it had never expected the government to provide new money from central funds to pay for the reorganisation.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Philippe Reinhard: "Foreign Policy: End of </F> Reserved Domain?"]    [Excerpts] No international issue in France gave rise to so  much debate as the former Yugoslavia question, so much so that  it has become a domestic policy issue. For the past three years,  numerous politicians have either acquired or regained a  reputation by staking positions on the Bosnian conflict. While  it is impossible to doubt the good faith of those concerned with  this situation, it must be admitted that many of our deputies  used the Yugoslav tragedy more for their own purposes than to  help the martyred population.    At a time when the situation in the field is modified by the  stated will of the Western powers to intervene, the discretion  observed by the professionals of humanitarian-military  intervention should be noted. Everything is now occurring as if  only one man is in charge of the issue, Minister of Foreign  Affairs Alain Juppe, who is putting a new face on cohabitation.  The president and the prime minister remain silent, letting  Juppe--and, to a certain extent, [Minister of Defense] Francois  Leotardl--occupy first place, a situation not devoid of  political and institutional consequences.    It has been clear for 10 months that the "reserved domain"  no  longer exists. The second cohabitation has profoundly modified  the distribution of responsibilities between the Elysee  [presidential office], Matignon [prime minister's office] and  the government. No longer does the president possess all the  power in military and diplomatic matters. The "reserved domain,"  which does not exist on paper but has been constant practice  since 1958, is now the "shared domain." Foreign policy handling  has provoked no incidents since the advent of the Edouard  Balladur government. The essential agreement between the  president and the prime minister on important issues such as the  GATT, but also the will of the two men to avoid messing up  France's image following a political confrontation, have allowed  France to speak with one voice.  <H5>  Shared Domain </H5>   This does not mean that the Elysee and Matignon are in sync  on all foreign policy or defense issues, as illustrated by the  nuclear testing question, where it was indicative that the  criticism expressed by part of the majority was directed at  Edouard Balladur more than at Francois Mitterrand. Those within  the Right who contest the "shared domain" are accusing Matignon  and no longer the Elysee. Thus, foreign policy has become a  domestic policy issue within the majority.    If the competition between the two heads of the executive  branch was obvious in foreign affairs between 1986 and 1988, the  second cohabitation is characterized by the absence of  confrontation--at least publicly--in this field. This situation  renders Matignon and the Elysee relatively discreet. The  minister of foreign affairs thus is called upon to be much more  present on the media scene than his predecessors, all the more  so since, in Alain Juppe's case, he is not the spokesman for  Matignon, nor, of course, for the Elysee. [passage omitted] With  regard to the Bosnian conflict, it seems that Juppe is the true  head of the general staff, alone on the front lines and seconded  only by Francois Leotard.  <H5>  Super Star </H5>   Juppe never misses a chance to note that he handles the  issue  in perfect accord with the president and the prime minister.  However, Mitterrand and Balladur's silence leave the starring  role to Juppe, omnipresent on radio and television and seemingly  the only leader. France is speaking through him.    If, tomorrow, French firmness were to foster the conclusion  of a real cease-fire and the acceleration of the Geneva  negotiations, Matignon and the Elysee's voice surely would be  heard. Nevertheless, Juppe would still derive a legitimate  benefit. Thus the foreign affairs minister is playing an  important personal game. If the policy France advocates leads to  a happy solution in the former Yugoslavia, Juppe will be the man  who unblocked the situation. He will have proved that the  statesmanlike qualities attributed to him are indeed real. He  will also be able to claim new responsibilities in the future,  beginning with the leadership of the single list of the majority  for the European Parliament elections. The Bosnian issue, which  has been poisoning French political life for months, will then  have served to restore reasonableness to the majority.</p>

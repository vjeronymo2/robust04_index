			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Polish minister quits in row over bank job Mr Andrzej Olechowski, Poland's foreign minister, resigned yesterday claiming his honesty had been questioned by publication of a list of politicians' directorships. Mr Olechowski, a former finance minister, said that Mr Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, the justice minister who had prepared the list of senior government officials on the supervisory boards of state owned and private companies had 'questioned his honesty' by suggesting he had been improperly paid for a second job. Mr Olechowski had figured correctly on the list as the head of the supervisory board of the state owned Bank Handlowy, one of the country's largest banks. By Polish law government officials are permitted to represent the state on the boards of nationalised companies but are not allowed to accept pay from sources other than their post in the administration. The law has however remained a dead letter and contains no sanctions for transgressors. The list included 56 officials in such posts of whom a mere handful did the work for no extra pay. Mr Olechowski was stated to have received pay of three times the average wage. Mr Olechowski, who said he would stay in post until December, became foreign minister a year ago when he joined the government as a nominee of President Walesa. Under Poland's constitution, the president has special responsibility for the foreign, internal affairs and defence ministries which are cabinet posts. The last year has seen repeated turf wars over these three ministries between the president and Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, head of the Peasant Party. The search for Mr Olechowski's successor provides the opportunity for a full scale clash as Mr Walesa recently made clear he wants to co-ordinate foreign policy. Mr Olechowski is a non party politician whom opinion polls show as being one of the country's few potential candidates who stand a chance of winning next year's presidential election against Mr Pawlak or Mr Alexander Kwasniewski, head of the post communist Left Democratic Alliance. President Walesa is trailing in the polls, with 48 per cent saying he is mistrusted. Mr Olechowski in contrast is mistrusted by a mere 8 per cent. His confidence rating is 54 per cent, just behind that of Mr Kwasniewski and Mr Pawlak. President Walesa last night appealed to Poles to support his efforts to strengthen the powers of the presidency and said he would only run for re-election if this happened. 'We need order and strong authority', he said on television. 'Today's Poland is weak and nobody's in charge,' he added, saying that a strong presidency would enable him to 'rule with a strong hand'.</p>

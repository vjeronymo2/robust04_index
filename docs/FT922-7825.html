			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow suffers a setback as investors cash in Wall Street PROFIT-TAKING in the wake of recent gains sent US share prices tumbling yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 23.10 down at 3,368.88. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 receded 3.31 to 413.14, while the Nasdaq composite index slipped 5.92 to 576.46. Turnover on the New York SE totalled 200m shares, and declines outpaced rises by a ratio of more than two-to-one. There has been growing concern this week that recent gains may have been overdone, and analysts have cautioned that the failure of broader indices to match the Dow's advance is a warning that a correction might be imminent. The day's only economic news - a 10,000 increase in weekly jobless claims - also unsettled investors, who have been waiting a long time for the labour market to show signs of a sustainable recovery. Advanced Micro Devices fell Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 15 5/8 in volume of 4m shares after Intel, its main rival in the microprocessor business, said it would cut prices on an advanced chip in the third quarter. Intel, quoted on the Nasdaq, lost Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 49. Clothing retailer Gap dropped Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 36 5/8 in turnover of 3.99m shares after reporting first-quarter net income of 32 cents a share, up from 29 cents a year ago. The market reacted negatively to the news because the figures were slightly below the median of analysts' forecasts. McDonnell Douglas plunged Dollars 5 5/8 to Dollars 47 1/8 in the wake of a recommendation from a Congressional committee that funding for the troubled C-17 cargo jet, made by McDonnell, be cut by 30 per cent. Cray Research tumbled Dollars 5 3/4 to Dollars 32 3/4 after the company warned late on Wednesday that it expected 1992 earnings to come in somewhere between 10 and 20 per cent below those achieved in 1991. Trading in the stock had been halted pending the news, and yesterday morning was the first opportunity for investors to respond to the news. On the over-the-counter market, Adolph Coors rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 19 7/8 after the group announced a planned demerger of its non-brewing businesses, which include ceramics, aluminium and packaging units. New York Bancorp advanced Dollars 2 to Dollars 19 1/4 in the wake of a big rise in fiscal second-quarter earnings to Dollars 1.46 a share. Also firmer in the banking sector was Northern Trust, Dollars  3/8 up at Dollars 58 1/2 , with both buoyed by a ratings upgrade from Alex Brown, the Baltimore-based securities house. Canada STRONG gains in gold shares, with the sector's index climbing 3.66 per cent, lifted Toronto from a midday low, although losses in most other sectors kept the market in negative territory. The financial services and communications groups both closed down more than 1.5 per cent. Olympia &amp; York lost an appeal in a London court which could force the troubled property giant to pay Morgan Stanley USDollars 240m as soon as next Wednesday. The composite index closed 15.9 off at 3,388.3, after 3,381.4. Falls led rises by 306 to 245 after volume of 28m shares.</p>

			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / OECD struggles to adjust to harder times: Heavier workload and resource constraints are straining the organisation When Mr Jean Claude Paye, secretary-general of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, returned to his desk last month one of his first tasks was a fax. In a politically tactful move, he sent a message to Mr Donald Johnston, the Canadian recently selected to succeed him, offering congratulations him on his appointment - and any advice he might need. In usual circumstances, the move might have seemed unremarkable. But as Mr Paye surveys the scene from his elegant offices in the OECD's Paris headquarters, both his position and the organisation's situation look anything but normal. Earlier this year the OECD was shaken by a bruising diplomatic row over whether Mr Paye should continue in the post he has held for the past 10 years, or be replaced. The issue was finally resolved by agreeing that Mr Johnston will succeed Mr Paye after 17 months. The dispute, however, has highlighted new uncertainties about the future of the group, which promotes co-operation among 25 of the world's leading industrial economies. For with the OECD's workload surging, budgetary and political constraints are threatening to leave the organisation hamstrung - and Mr Paye and his successor facing an increasingly difficult task. 'We are not stifled yet but we are in a difficult position in reconciling this wish for more work and sufficient resources,' Mr Paye says. 'One of our concerns is that in some areas we are thinly spread now.' In the short term, Mr Paye's first challenge is to smooth over the diplomatic split between the European and non-European members that was generated by his reappointment. 'It certainly was an unfortunate period, the battle for the secretary generalship,' admits Mr Paye, a discreet and dapper French diplomat. 'But to some extent I welcome this because it proves that there is a conviction in member countries that the organisation matters.' Indeed, back in his office, he insists that all is business as usual. In his remaining time he plans to press ahead in the two main areas of change that have emerged in recent years: the enlargement of the organisation to include countries such as Poland; and its move into new areas of social policy research, such as the OECD's celebrated recent jobs study. And he shrugs off suggestions that his moves will be hampered by the Americans who opposed his reappointment. 'I don't see the interest the Americans would have in blocking something. . . . If they were to do so they would provoke retaliation later on,' he says, insisting that this would go against the 'culture' of the organisation. But the real question that now hangs over the OECD is whether Mr Paye's cautious 'business as usual' approach will be enough to tackle the broader problems it faces. The OECD started life as an overseer of the post-war Marshall Plan, and was established in its present form as a meeting place for governments and source of economic research almost 30 years ago. But rapid changes in the world economy have called this role into question, as groups like the European Union have come to serve as an alternative source of co-operation. Meanwhile, the OECD's claim to promote co-operation in the industrial world appears increasingly anomalous, given that countries like the so-called Asian tigers are not members. As Mr Paye points out, these problems of geopolitical change also dog other institutions like the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe or the Nato alliance. But the OECD's distinctive culture of polite peer pressure and consensus means that pushing through radical reforms is particularly difficult. Although Mr Paye believes, for example, that further changes are needed to the OECD's internal structure, this is proving sensitive because its members demand that the organisation should mirror the structure of their governments. Attempts to fuse some computing, industry and science committees earlier this year were blocked. Meanwhile, moving funds from lesser known programmes like tourism research to new projects is hard. 'We have tried to chop some programmes, but it proves very difficult to get unanimous agreement. We almost scuttled the budget discussions one year because one country insisted on maintaining the activities on pulp and paper,' he says. One solution, Mr Paye says, might be to end the requirement of unanimity in the budget discussions. But pushing this through may be difficult, not least because some members are already grumbling about the OECD's budget, currently about FFr1.3bn (Pounds 155m). The UK, for example, recently decided to stop funding the OECD Development Centre, complaining that its budgetary contributions had surged by 40 per cent in the past four years. The OECD insists that the real increase is 28 per cent, with most of this due to new research into east Europe. But Mr Paye admits that Britain's move could prove the tip of an iceberg if the organisation were 'unable to adjust and develop to meet its challenges'. With Mr Paye hoping that the four Visegrad countries (Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia) will join the OECD in 1996, and South Korea already having announced its intention of becoming a member, he insists that the organisation still has a future. Indeed, he argues that the development of such regional trading blocs as the EU and North American Free Trade Agreement means the OECD should now aim to play a vital role as a 'meeting point for policy dialogue between those groups.' But if the OECD is to achieve this role, it will require a new clarity of vision from both Mr Paye and Mr Johnston. And with the former now planning to meet the latter for exploratory talks next spring, it appears that the two men will have much to discuss - irrespective of the previous diplomatic dispute.</p>

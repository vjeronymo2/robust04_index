			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SAVVY TRAVELER: FACTS BEHIND AVIATION'S FREQUENT SURCHARGES;  </P> <P> AIRLINES: THE PRICE OF YOUR NEXT FLIGHT MAY NOT BE WHAT YOU ORIGINALLY PLANNED.  FACT IS, IT LIKELY WILL BE MORE. CREDIT THE DISCREPANCY TO CAREFULLY HIDDEN  COSTS.  </P> <P> An air fare is advertised for $298. But when you pay for your ticket, you  notice you've been charged $305. Another air fare is marketed at $500. But upon  departure, you're informed that another $12 is needed. Isolated incidents?  Incorrect fare calculations?  </P> <P> Hardly. Airline fare surcharges represent one of the more insulting, insidious  and often misleading aspects of travel.  </P> <P> These extra charges are now being placed on a variety of domestic and  international flights. They are not always disclosed to passengers by the  airlines or their travel agents, they often appear and disappear without  notice, and they can add substantially to the cost of travel.  </P> <P> Consider these current charges that are included as part of your airline fare:  </P> <P>  -- 8% federal excise tax.  </P> <P>  -- $6 international departure fee.  </P> <P>  -- $5 surcharge by certain U.S. airlines (Pan Am, American, TWA, United, Delta  and Northwest) on their transatlantic routes to cover security costs.  </P> <P>  -- $2.50 fuel surcharge on most domestic flights originating in Boston.  </P> <P>  -- $5 fuel surcharge for flights from Chicago.  </P> <P>  -- $2 fuel surcharge for flights departing from Florida.  </P> <P>  -- $2.20 fuel add-on for flights leaving San Juan, Puerto Rico.  </P> <P>  -- $1 to $2 surcharge on most domestic flights leaving Denver to finance  airport terminal improvements.  </P> <P>  -- $2 one-way security surcharge for flights heading towards the Bahamas or  Bermuda.  </P> <P> In addition, foreign passengers coming into the United States from countries  other than Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean are assessed a $5 U.S. Customs fee.  </P> <P> Most passengers never know about these surcharges before they make their ticket  purchases. And many travelers only discover the excess fees after they've  completed their journey.  </P> <P> Both passengers and travel agents aren't thrilled about the additional charges.  </P> <P> "It sometimes puts us in a bad position," says Annette Alvarez, director of  sales and marketing for the Travel Store, a Los Angeles travel agency, "because  we have to explain extra charges that we had nothing to do with.  </P> <P> "These surcharges may not be that big, but they do have an effect on the  leisure traveler, who feels that he or she is being abused. If they're going to  add these charges, why not throw in a free headset or drink as compensation?"  </P> <P> "Because it is not a prudent business decision to do so," says one airline  spokesman. "We are adding the surcharges because they are costs assessed  against us that we didn't plan on when we established our fare structures. We  need to find a way to recover these costs."  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the surcharges keep coming.  </P> <P> At this writing, there are a number of newly proposed surcharges that only  promise to make air travel even more expensive:  </P> <P>  -- A $1 to $3 U.S. Department of Agriculture inspection charge for passengers  coming into the United States.  </P> <P>  -- A $1 charge (called a "ticket-writing fee") to fund the U.S. Travel and  Tourism Administration.  </P> <P>  -- A $1, $2 or $3 Passenger Facilities Charge, to fund expansion and  renovation at U.S. airports.  </P> <P>  -- An increase in the current federal excise tax on domestic tickets, from 8%  to 10%.  </P> <P> The proposed excise tax increase has drawn the most fire.  </P> <P> "That represents a 25% tax increase," says Drew Steketee, executive director of  the Partnership for Improved Air Travel, "and we think that's excessive and  unnecessary."  </P> <P> Since 1988, the partnership (funded by 14 airlines and 19 manufacturers) has  been fighting the management of the Aviation Trust Fund (where the excise tax  dollars rest), claiming that the fund has a substantial surplus and is not used  fully to improve the U.S. air travel system.  </P> <P> Under the law that established the fund, the 8% tax currently included as part  of your domestic air fare pays for 100% of new air-traffic control systems, a  substantial portion of airport capacity improvements, and a partial funding of  the Federal Aviation Administration.  </P> <P> Each year, passengers pay a federal excise tax of 8% on all domestic airline  tickets. That tax generates $4 billion in revenues. (Since 1982, more than $31  billion has been raised for the Aviation Trust Fund. Currently, the fund has a  balance of $14 billion, of which only half has been earmarked for aviation  project spending.)  </P> <P> That leaves a surplus of $7 billion. "With that kind of surplus," Steketee  argues, "you've got to ask what do they want the additional money for?  Historically, this fund has a track record that stinks, and most consumers have  difficulty understanding the need for more funds when current funds aren't  being committed."  </P> <P> In June, the partnership generated 10,000 letters from its membership to  Congress opposing the new tax.  </P> <P> Also pending before Congress is a bill that would create a Passenger Facility  Charge, or PFC. It would allow a charge of $1, $2 or $3 -- depending on the  size and operating costs of an airport -- to passengers for using that  particular airport. The charge would be collected as part of the airline ticket  price.  </P> <P> But the PFC legislation, if passed, might cost passengers far more than $3. For  example, a passenger flying round trip between Los Angeles and New York who  changes planes at a hub airport en route in each direction could pay a PFC as  high as $12.  </P> <P> The legislation has passed the House and is being considered in the Senate.  </P> <P> In the past, some airlines have announced their own surcharges as a means of  opposing local plans that would drive up their costs.  </P> <P> In 1986, after Las Vegas officials announced the expansion of an airport  terminal, American Airlines argued -- unsuccessfully -- that the plans were too  costly and that they would substantially increase the rent for terminal space  that American paid in Las Vegas.  </P> <P> When McCarran Airport officials seemed to ignore American's protests, the  airline announced that it was imposing a $7.50 per-passenger surcharge on Las  Vegas flights to help cover the airline's higher costs.  </P> <P> "Soon thereafter," reports one airline source, "the authorities reached an  agreement with the airline, and the surcharge was dropped."  </P> <P> American has since announced other surcharges, which were also dropped when no  other competing carriers went along with the increases.  </P> <P> A few months ago, the Port Authority of New York (which operates both J.F.K.  and La Guardia airports) informed a number of airlines using La Guardia that it  would be installing imported granite floors in many of the terminal areas,  which would result in higher user costs to the airlines.  </P> <P> Immediately, American and United protested vigorously. "It was not only an  excessive charge," says American spokesman Al Becker, "it was unrealistic. Who  needs imported granite? It's not as durable as the high-strength tile we were  already using in other areas of the terminal. But they were requiring us to do  it."  </P> <P> American says it was also being hit with similarly excessive charges at four  other airports. "We saw no other way to recover our costs," says Becker, "than  to announce a surcharge."  </P> <P> In early July, American announced a $1 to $4 "excess facilities" surcharge on  departures and arrivals that were due to take effect last week at La Guardia,  Newark, New Orleans, West Palm Beach and Ft. Myers, Fla.  </P> <P> But when no other airline moved to match the surcharges, American quickly  dropped them.  </P> <P> The next time you make an airline reservation, double-check that the price  quoted in advertisements is the actual price you will pay. If it is not, demand  to know if there is a surcharge being added and, if so, the reason for the  surcharge.  </P> <P> If enough passengers complain -- to the airlines, to their travel agents and to  their legislators -- there's a reasonably good chance that these annoying, and  expensive, add-ons can be curtailed . . . or at least controlled.  </P></p>

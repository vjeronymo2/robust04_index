			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Rao party faces state poll defeat India's governing Congress (I) party is facing serious defeat in the latest round of state elections, according to results announced yesterday. As vote-counting continued in Andhra Pradesh, home state of Mr Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, Congress faced its most humiliating and politically significant defeat at the hands of the regional Telugu Desam party. In Karnataka, the centrist Janata Dal was emerging as a clear winner, and Congress was also trailing in the border state of Sikkim. 'Our performance is simply shattering,' said Mr Pranab Mukherjee, commerce minister, on television. In the western state of Goa, the party was faring better, running neck and neck with an alliance led by the Hindu nationalist Bhartiya Janata party. The outcome could herald a disruptive bout of squabbling among party chiefs but is not expected to threaten the stability of Mr Rao's government.</p>

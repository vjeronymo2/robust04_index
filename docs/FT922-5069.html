			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Multinationals' cross-border trade surges FOREIGN direct investment and cross-border trade within multinationals have surged in the past decade, transforming the shape of international trade and leading to 'global integration of manufacturing', a World Bank report says. International trade inside the world's largest 350 multinational companies accounts for almost 40 per cent of world merchandise trade, which in 1990 amounted to Dollars 3,485bn (Pounds 1,936bn), the bank says in its 1992 report on Global Economic Prospects and the Developing Countries. More than a third of US trade in 1990, which amounted to Dollars 887.2bn, was between US companies and their overseas affiliates. A quarter of the purchases of Japanese companies is from affiliates based in east Asia, while one-third of the affiliates' purchases is from parent companies in Japan. The report reveals that in the early 1980s, almost half Singapore's exports was by US-owned companies; over half Malaysia's exports to the US was from affiliates of US companies. Taiwan's five top electronics exporters are US-owned. 'However, the pace of global integration in manufacturing production appears to be slowing partly as a result of protectionism.' Underpinning this integration has been an unprecedented rise in foreign direct investment. After 'unremarkable' growth up to 1982, foreign investment grew five-fold to average over Dollars 125bn a year between 1985 and 1989. The EC accounted for 47 per cent of this. The EC, US and Japan together accounted for 80 per cent. Among non-OECD investors, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and China 'played an increasingly important role' in the late 1980s. Comparatively few countries have benefited from these investment flows, the bank shows. High-income countries benefited most, winning almost 80 per cent of the total. Of the Dollars 24bn going to developing countries in 1989, five states took 80 per cent: China (24 per cent), Brazil (18 per cent), Mexico (17 per cent), Egypt and Malaysia (10 per cent each).</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, it has begun the preliminary work required to effect compliance in production vehicles manufactured beginning July 1996. During that time, it estimates that it will spend between $500,000 and $900,000 on research, development, and tooling changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lamborghini argued that an exemption would be in the public interest and consistent with the objectives of motor vehicle safety because it is ``one of the last small, pioneering and independent automobile manufacturers *&blank;*&blank;* precisely the type of small manufacturer that the *&blank;*&blank;* temporary exemption authority is intended to assist.'' Its vehicles ``are used predominantly for shorter pleasure, rather than commuting or longer, trips'' so that an exemption ``would have an imperceptible impact on motor vehicle safety.'' It points out that the livelihoods of its workers in U.S. distributorships and dealerships would be affected by a denial.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No comments were received on the application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency has reviewed Lamborghini's application. Given the fact that 25% of its sales over the past five years have been in the U.S. market and that this is likely to be the case in the event an exemption is granted, it is manifest that a denial until compliance with Standard No. 214 can be effected would cause the applicant substantial economic hardship within the meaning of the statute. Indeed, Lamborghini has had to suspend production of its cars for the U.S. market since September 1, 1994, and a present hardship already exists. Because of its previous relationship to Chrysler for the purpose of compliance with the phase-in requirement, it had a good faith basis upon which to delay compliance with Standard No. 214 until the end of the phase-in period, August 31, 1996. Although the company had net operating losses of $5,000,000 in 1993, it is nevertheless prepared to spend an estimated $500,000 to $900,000 to achieve compliance by July 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the estimated 250 cars that would be produced under an exemption are not a significant part of the nation's vehicle fleet and, as the applicant argues, are generally not used in everyday driving. Presumably the company has been meeting, and will continue to meet, the requirements of Standard No. 214 which continue in effect until the phase-in period ends as of September 1, 1996. In this light, an exemption becomes one more of form than of substance. Lamborghini has sold vehicles in the United States for the better part of 30 years and its, goodwill, dealers and service personnel would be affected by its inability to continue business.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In consideration of the foregoing, it is hereby found that compliance would cause substantial economic hardship to a company that has tried to comply with the standard in good faith, and that a temporary exemption is consistent with the public interest and the objectives of motor vehicle safety. Accordingly, Automobili Lamborghini is hereby granted NHTSA Exemption No. 94&hyph;6, expiring September 1, 1996, from 49 CFR 571.214 Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 214  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Side Impact Protection <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (49 U.S.C. 30113; delegation of authority at 49 CFR 1.50)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued on November 9, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Ricardo Martinez,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;28381 Filed 11&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;59&hyph;P  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

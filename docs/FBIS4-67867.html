			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [``Perilous Development'' -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- Two transports of the  U.S. Navy loaded with Patriot missiles to be deployed in South  Korea arrived at Pusan port on Monday, says a report from Seoul.    The unloading of 48 launching pads, 192 Patriot missiles and  84 stinger missiles has begun. Their frontline deployment will  reportedly be completed by the 29th of this month.    The second batch of Patriot missiles will shortly arrive to  be deployed by the same date, the report says.    The shipment of Patriot to South Korea by the United States  and the South Korean puppet clique is a very dangerous  development leading the military situation on the Korean  peninsula to the brink of war. This is a vivid indication that  the rash scheme of the United States and the Kim Yong-sam  traitor clique to overpower our Republic militarily has already  entered a practical stage.    Our people and the Asian people are deeply concerned over  the  reckless military action of the U.S. and the South Korean puppet  clique.    The U.S. authorities claim that the Patriot is ``a defensive  weapon.'' But it is a nonsense. In the Korean peninsula which  is not large, it can also be used as an attack weapon capable of  striking any spot. It is known to everyone that the target of  its strike can be freely altered by the warhead it is tipped  with.    The shipment of the new-type Patriot to South Korea by the  United States and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is an open new  war provocation act to pose a military threat to the DPRK and  deal a preemptive strike at it.    The fact proves that the United States, from the very  beginning, did not have the intention to solve the nuclear issue  on the Korean peninsula through dialogue and negotiation but has  used the problem as an expedient to overpower our Republic,  motivated by its outdated hostile policy to stifle it.    In trying to subdue us with the help of outside forces by  bringing in without hesitation even the Patriot, a mass  destruction weapon, the South Korean puppet clique stands naked  once again revealing its ugly color to the world as a  never-to-be-condoned flunkeyist traitor and warmaniac.    It is a foolish dream for the United States and the South  Korean puppet clique to try to overpower us with strength. It  is the unshakable will of our people to answer strength with  strength.    The United States and the South Korean puppet clique must  not  act rashly but promptly stop the deployment of the new-type  missiles in South Korea, clearly seeing the unshakable will of  our people.</p>

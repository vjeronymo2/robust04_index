			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DECEMBER UNEMPLOYMENT RATE UNCHANGED AT 5.3%  </P> <P> The economy's recent slowing continued in December with the creation of only  142,000 new payroll jobs -- 55,000 of them going to telephone workers returning  to work after a strike -- while unemployment remained unchanged at 5.3%, the  Labor Department said Friday.  </P> <P> Some of the softening in job growth was attributable to an abnormally cold  early winter, which knocked 38,000 construction jobs off the rolls. The 142,000  new jobs compared to November's total of 222,000.  </P> <P> Factory jobs fell by 25,000 in December, the ninth consecutive monthly decline  and a sign of a continuing contraction. Altogether, the U.S. economy shed  195,000 factory jobs from March, the last month in which factory jobs  increased, through December.  </P> <P> In California, civilian unemployment in December was estimated at 5.3%, up from  5% in November and 4.8% in October.  </P> <P> Continuing a pattern that began early in the year, almost all December job  growth was within the service sector, where 206,000 new jobs were created. The  health subsector alone generated about 525,000 new jobs in 1989.  </P> <P> The December employment figures indicated that the economy has been growing  very slowly, if at all, with only a fitful recovery from the battering it took  from Hurricane Hugo in September, the San Francisco Bay Area Quake in October  and a spate of nasty labor disputes in November.  </P> <P> The monthly report, said Bureau of Labor Statistics Director Janet L. Norwood,  was "consistent with a general slowing in the rate of job growth throughout  1989."  </P> <P> In some respects, the job picture in December was even worse than the figures  suggested. If the 55,000 returning NYNEX strikers are subtracted from the  payroll tally, job creation falls from 142,000 to less than 100,000, by far the  weakest showing of the year.  </P> <P> "In terms of duration, the factory jobs lost are much fewer than in 1984 to  1987, when the high dollar squashed the manufacturing sector," observed Irwin  L. Kellner, an economist with Manufacturers Hanover in New York. "But it's  still a disturbing trend. We are entering 1990 on a down note."  </P> <P> Kellner predicted that the gross national product, the basic measure of the  nation's economy, will post slight contractions in both the fourth quarter of  1989 and the first quarter of 1990.  </P> <P> On the services side, Kellner warned that the expansion in medical services and  some of the lower-paying service industries may signal that some people are  taking on two jobs, perhaps part time, to make ends meet.  </P> <P> "If the hurricane, the earthquake and the strikes were the only reasons for  weakness late last year, we should have seen more rebound in December," he  said.  </P> <P> Donald Straszheim, an economist with the Merrill Lynch investment firm in New  York, said December's job growth should be adjusted downward to offset the  returning NYNEX workers as well as an increase in government employment  mandated by the Labor Department's seasonal adjustment formulas. The result, he  calculated, would be real job growth of only 75,000 -- a clear sign of a very  sluggish economy.  </P> <P> But Giulio Martini of the Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. investment firm in New  York interpreted the data differently. If occasional fluctuations in public  employment over the last six months are combined with adjustments for strikes  during the same period, he said, net new employment in the private sector has  averaged about 130,000 a month since the middle of 1989.  </P> <P> By that measure, Martini said, the December report "is not exactly an  indication that something has gone drastically wrong."  </P> <P> Apart from the weather-related collapse in construction jobs, Martini said, the  slowdown in manufacturing generally can be attributed to problems in the auto  industry, which has been plagued by overcapacity and foreign competition.  </P> <P> "We have had unemployment hovering at or near 5.3% for six months now, and  unemployment does rise if the economy slows drastically," Martini observed.  "Instead, this suggests that the economy is growing at something close to its  long-term trend."  </P> <P> The Labor Department's estimate of 5.3% unemployment for all workers in  December was unchanged from November. Also unchanged was a separate measure of  civilian unemployment that excludes members of the armed forces residing in the  United States.  </P> <P> Last month, the department estimated that November unemployment among civilians  was 5.4% -- the highest since the first month of the year -- but in Friday's  report that estimate was revised downward to 5.3%.  </P> <P> In a separate report, the Commerce Department said factory orders soared in  November to near-record levels. Orders for both durable and non-durable  manufactured goods jumped 2.4% for the month to a seasonally adjusted $239.7  billion, after edging down 0.1% in October.  </P> <P> It was the highest level of orders since a record $239.9 billion in April and  the fastest rate of increase since a 2.8% advance in August. Factory orders are  usually a good indicator of future production activity.  </P></p>

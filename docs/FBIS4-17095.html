			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Pavel Felgengauer report under the general heading "Bosnian </F> Crisis as a Pretext for Staff Intrigues:" "Grachev Thinks it Is  Not Deputy Ministers Who Should Hold Talks on Peace in Bosnia"]    [Text] "I do not quite agree with Vitaliy Churkin; it  would not be correct to accuse the Bosnian Serbs alone of  violating the truce and delivering strikes," Russian Federation  Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said, answering a question by  your SEGODNYA correspondent following the signing of an  agreement with Turkey on military and technical cooperation.  "The situation in the Gorazde area is complicated -- both sides  are to blame." He also said that on 17 and 18 April he spoke on  the phone with General Radko Mladic, the Serb commander in chief  in Bosnia, and asked him "not to attack Gorazde." According to  Gen. Grachev, the Serb forces did not attack Gorazde "for those  two days." But afterward "provocative actions by the other side  followed."    Gen. Grachev said that "air strikes are very dangerous  politically and they do not produce any military results. It is  necessary to sit down at the negotiating table -- not for the  officials who are currently holding the talks at the level of  deputy foreign ministers, but at the level of heads of state and  government."    Russia is not going to send extra troop contingents to  Bosnia, because, according to Pavel Grachev, "an extra battalion  will not make any difference; what is needed is up to 70,000  soldiers, but this is unrealistic." But Moscow does not  currently plan to withdraw its peacemakers, either.    Turkish Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan, on his part, said  that his country is ready to send troops to Bosnia.</p>

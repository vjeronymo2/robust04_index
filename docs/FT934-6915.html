			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Sparks fly in steel clash - Issue is deadlocked The row over steel between the US and the European Union is expected to be one of the most contentious items addressed by Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, in their Washington talks which began yesterday. The issue threatens to pose a serious obstacle to a wide-ranging package of market-opening measures for industrial goods in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks, due to end on December 15. Negotiators from 36 leading steel producers meeting in Geneva last week failed to make progress in negotiating a multilateral steel agreement (MSA), on which a provisionally agreed zero-tariff deal for steel depends. Zero tariffs for steel are a hefty slice of the value to the EU of the US tariff offer, without which officials say the deal would be seriously unbalanced. The MSA talks are deadlocked over US insistence that allowable subsidies, such as those for environmental improvement, plant closure and research and development, should be actionable under domestic anti-subsidy laws. The MSA as drafted would outlaw most subsidies to the industry, alongside a 10-year phase-out of tariff and non-tariff barriers to steel trade. The EU and others, still smarting from a string of anti-dumping and countervailing duty suits on their exports brought by the US steel industry last year (most of them later rejected), want strong MSA provisions to prevent further harassment and immediate agreement to lift duties. Both sides have made limited gestures of flexibility but a sticking point has been Washington's refusal to deny its steel industry the right to petition the government for action. A senior US official said a new working draft would be presented to the next MSA meeting in December, but expressed little optimism.</p>

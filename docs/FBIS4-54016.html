			<p>BFN     [Text] Fujitsu Ltd. has decided to triple procurement of  foreign-made parts and materials by fiscal 1996 to increase the  share of foreign-made parts to 30 percent of the total parts it  uses. Foreign-made parts are becoming less expensive due to the  recent appreciation of the yen, and Fujitsu intends to focus on  cost reduction through expanding use of foreign-made parts,  aiming at rehabilitation of worsened business records. In  addition to an office in Singapore, Fujitsu will open another  parts procurement office in Taiwan, and subsidiaries in China  will also expand parts supply to Japan. Earlier, NEC  Corporation announced its decision to increase purchases of  computer parts made in Southeast Asia; however, Fujitsu is the  first major computer manufacturer to indicate a target figure of  import increase.    Fujitsu's computer and telecommunications section uses many  electronic parts, plastic materials, metal parts, and cables,  and the total amount of parts procurement reaches approximately  1.2 trillion yen (including 600-700 billion yen purchase from  subsidiary companies). Foreign-made parts presently share about  10 percent of Fujitsu's annual parts purchase, but the company  intends to increase the rate to 30 percent of parts used by  Fujitsu and its subsidiaries in Japan.    Fujitsu's procurement section currently has an outpost  office  in Singapore, and is dealing with about 40 parts and material  manufacturers in Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand. To expand  procurement from Asian companies, the Singapore office will open  business with companies in Indonesia and other countries.  Moreover, Fujitsu intends to open another office in Taiwan  before the end of this year for reinforcing procurement of  Taiwanese-made computer parts. Even in China, Fujitsu is  planning to boost production of telecommunication devices in its  subsidiary, and to open a new joint venture company to produce  printers. Chinese-made parts used in these plants will also be  exported to Japan to push up the rate of foreign-made parts.    Fujitsu is suffering a sales slump in the computer section,  which earns 70 percent of the company's total profits, since the  first quarter of 1993. Market demands for larger multipurpose  computers are in decline mainly because of the prolonged  recession and downsizing (shift of consumer demands to smaller  models). In the January-March quarter of 1994, the sales of  Fujitsu computers is expected to drop to 1.49 trillion yen, down  15.4 percent from the previous quarter, and that of the entire  company will remain at 2.16 trillion yen, down 9.9 percent.    Fujitsu marked an 8.7 billion yen business loss in the  October-December quarter in 1993, but, in the January-March  quarter, the company is expected to announce 27 billion yen  profits owing to cost reductions and business rationalization  efforts. Yet, the business sector is reducing computer-related  investments under the recession, and consumers are leaning  toward less expensive models. Under such circumstances, a top  official said "a drastic increase in sales is unlikely."  Fujitsu is being pressed by an urgent need for cost reduction.</p>

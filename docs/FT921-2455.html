			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (6): Measuring the impact of media campaigns - User view: Spreadsheets analyse product references in press and TV THE London and Leeds-based public relations company, Infopress, believes it has cracked the problem of accurately measuring the impact of media campaigns with a system developed using the SuperCalc5 spreadsheet package from Computer Associates, one of its clients. Infopress, with 40 staff and a turnover of Pounds 3.2m, sends cuttings and broadcast transcripts to freelance researchers. They work out the length and how many times a company's name is mentioned and note occurrences of any marketing messages being promoted by the media campaign. The impact of each message in each item is given a score of between plus 10, representing unqualified praise, and minus 10, for stinging condemnation. The service typically covers the client and two competitors, plus three messages, although in theory there are no technical limits on the number of companies and messages being covered. Infopress makes this work as objective as possible by not telling the researchers which company is the client. The findings are sent in standard formats to Infopress, mostly by electronic mail, over a dial-up communications link or on disc sent by post. The data is received by a DEC Microvax 3400 computer, which combines all the information from different researchers and does preliminary number-crunching, using a program written by systems manager Dr Robert Walker. The data is then passed to SuperCalc spreadsheets running on a Wyse personal computer. The current data can be displayed graphically, typically as bar charts, to show, for example, the number of name references in specialist trade journals, general business journals, national newspapers and television and radio. This analysis can go right down to individual journals and journalists if necessary. Other spreadsheets show the impact of all promotional messages and of individual messages, again across the different media. Up to this point, SuperCalc is used mainly to convert the data into charts for easy assimilation. Indeed, Infopress considered desktop publishing packages for this task but settled on a spreadsheet product because of the next stage in the data analysis. In this next stage, Infopress uses the spreadsheet linking function to combine the current and historic data to show trends over the year. 'We particularly like this function, because the trend analyses enable us for the first time to show a client clearly if a programme is really taking off or if things are starting to go wrong,' says deputy chairman Dermot McKeone. The system, which Infopress calls Impact, allows the company to fine-tune campaigns, for example by showing that the technology leadership message is being picked up well by the trade press but not by national newspapers. 'Impact is designed to cut out the white noise to focus attention on priorities and provide data on which strategic and tactical decisions can be based,' says Mr McKeone.

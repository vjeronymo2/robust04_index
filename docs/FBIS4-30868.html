			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Dr. Janez Drnovsek said for our  radio and television station that he had accepted the  resignation offered by Interior Minister Ivo Bizjak. In reply  to a question by Bojan Veselinovic, Drnovsek said that if it  were not for the well-known Klagenfurt incident, Bizjak still  would have been minister. Dr. Janez Drnovsek also said:    [Begin recording] [Drnovsek] I have decided to accept the  resignation of Minister Bizjak. I believe that by offering his  resignation Minister Bizjak has acted in a principled and  correct manner and that I must act likewise and accept his  resignation. I believe that this will facilitate and safeguard  consolidation within the Interior Ministry.    [Veselinovic] Would you have decided to replace Minister  Bizjak even if the Klagenfurt incident had not happened?    [Drnovsek] I believe that the direct reason for this  replacement is the Klagenfurt incident, that this is a question  of objective responsibility just as was the case with [former  Defense] Minister Jansa. [end recording]    [Veselinovic] When asked whether he had proposed to Minister  Bizjak that he replace Vinko Beznik, head of the special police  troops, and Mitja Klavora, head of the Crime Department, even  before the Klagenfurt robbery, Drnovsek replied: not directly,  even though he had proposed, on the basis of the debate over the  government report on the Depala Vas incident, that Bizjak take  adequate measures within the ministry, including personnel  measures.    [Begin recording] [Veselinovic] Therefore, if the personnel  changes had been carried out and there had been no Klagenfurt  incident, hypothetically speaking Ivo Bizjak would have still  been the interior minister?    [Drnovsek] That is so. [end recording]    [Veselinovic] In the next few days Drnovsek will send a  proposal for the new interior minister to the State Chamber,  which will merely be informed of the acceptance of Bizjak's  resignation. Drnovsek did not comment on the names of the two  candidates known for far, for new interior minister. He only  said that he will decide in the next few days when, in  accordance with the coalition agreement, the Christian Democrats  will propose a candidate who will also have to be acceptable for  him as the prime minister.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sevastopol, 26 March -- As we reported earlier,  President of Crimea Yuriy Meshkov appeared on Crimean television  on 26 March with an address to the peninsula's population in  which he in fact urged the Crimean electorate to boycott  Ukraine's parliamentary election. Following the official part  of the address, Mr. Meshkov added: "Using this opportunity I  would like to express my view on the 27 March poll as that of a  citizen. Who will I vote in the election to the Supreme Council  of the Republic of Crimea? I will vote for candidates of the  Rossiya bloc. How will I reply to the ballot questions in the  poll of Republic of Crimea citizens on 27 March?    To the first question, "Are you in favor of restoring the  constitution of the Republic of Crimea of 26 May 1992 which  determines relations between the Republic of Crimea and Ukraine  on the basis of treaties and agreements?," I will say "yes". To  the second question, "Are you in favor of restoring the Republic  of Crimea constitution of 26 March 1992 which proclaims the  right of the Republic of Crimea to dual citizenship?," I will  say "yes". I will cross out the word "no." To the third  question, "Are you in favor of granting decrees by the president  of the Republic of Crimea the force of law on issues of  temporarily unregulated legislation?," I, as a citizen of the  Republic of Crimea, will say "yes" and will cross out "no."    I will take away the ballot paper containing the names,  first  names and patronymics of candidates for the Supreme Council of  Ukraine. I hope that 27 March will come up to the expectations  we have for this day."</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 22  April on page 6 carries a campaign ad for the Freedom Front  showing a person's arm with an intravenous tube protruding from  it. At the bottom it says: "HOW YOU CAN PREVENT BEING BLED  FINANCIALLY". Running across the bottom of the ad, from left to  right, is the Freedom Front logo, the words, "VOTE FREEDOM  FRONT", and a photograph of Freedom Front leader General  Constand Viljoen with a voter's checkmark next to it.</p>

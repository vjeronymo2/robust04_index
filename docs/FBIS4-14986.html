			<p>BFN     [Text] The Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar has told  INTERFAX that his country will block Russia's full membership in  the Council of Europe. In connection with the current Helsinki  seminar of the council on preparing new members which is  attended by a group of Russian deputies Laar said "the strong  interest of our neighbor in the East in membership can be viewed  from a positive angle."    However, the prime-minister said, the organization is  opposed  to the presence of foreign troops on the territory of a country  without consent. "Consequently, before becoming a full member of  the Council of Europe Russia should pull out its troops," Laar  said.    "If any European country wishes to revise the provision, the  Estonian delegation will be consistent on this question," he  added.    The question of admitting new members to the council is  decided on the basis of consensus.</p>

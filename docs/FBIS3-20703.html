			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Geza Jeszenszky, minister of foreign </F> affairs, by Witold Pawlowski; place and date not given: "Moods  in a Waiting Room"]    [Excerpts] [Pawlowski] The meeting in Prague was meant to  be a good test for the Visegrad Group. Euphemistically speaking,  it did not turn out to be successful. The hosts came up with an  idea to seat the delegations at separate national tables during  the official dinner. Is this separation a sign that the group  will part company?    [Jeszenszky] Central Europe specifically represented by the  Visegrad Group has a concrete base, bound by historical and  dynastic ties, the experience of the 18th and 19th centuries,  the loss and regaining of independence, the difficult task of  regaining statehood, and the common experience with communism.  Today's problems, specifically those of the four countries, our  mentality, the state of the environment. Everything is similar.    [Pawlowski] One can see that this is still too little. Does  the clear lack of interest from the Czech side and the growing  strain between the Hungarians and the Slovaks mean that the  group has de facto fallen apart?    [Jeszenszky] Regardless of whether someone likes the name  Visegrad Group and the idea of common meetings and  consultations, Central Europe exists because of historical,  cultural, and economic ties. Specifically, the last two need  rejuvenation. The CEFTA [Central European Free Trade  Association] free trade zone should help in this. Paradoxically,  foreigners are also helping us; the Americans, who sought to  have the four [Visegrad Group] hold a joint meeting in Prague,  also the European Union and other European institutions that  treat us as a group of states.    Hungary and Poland are for continuing this form of  cooperation. Slovakia, although with less enthusiasm, is also  behind this. The Czechs will also come around to realizing that  there are no shortcuts into Europe or NATO and that all of our  countries will more or less at the same time enter European  institutions. At that point, we should maintain Central European  Solidarity, just like the Scandinavian countries.    [Pawlowski] Solidarity is a beautiful word. Will Slovenia  join us? The Hungarians are already laying the groundwork.    [Jeszenszky] Slovenia is doing splendidly and does not  deserve to be on the sidelines just because it was a republic in  Yugoslavia in the past.    [Pawlowski] Who else is waiting in line?    [Jeszenszky] I am not against new members, but we should not  forget about the Central European Initiative, the CEI, grouping  us with many of our neighbors. It does not matter what this  organization will be called because we cannot escape from our  neighbors. [passage omitted]    [Pawlowski] The elections in Europe were a surprise on both  sides of the former Iron Curtain. Social frustrations becoming  apparent. Extremists are coming to the fore, from both the left  and the right. Populists, nationalists. Do you believe, sir,  that, in the spring parliamentary elections, the Italian  scenario may repeat itself in Hungary, when in the end the  socialists, yesterday's communists, and the far right met?    [Jeszenszky] Italy is Italy, and Hungary is Hungary. I  believe that in Hungary the elections will be between the  parties from the center. In Hungary, there are some extremists  of various shades, but they are not strong or radical or  dangerous enough. [passage omitted]    [Pawlowski] Mr. Minister, you stated that Hungarian  politicians do not differ on foreign policy. Didn't this  consensus collapse when Istvan Csurka attacked the proposal in  parliament concerning the final borders between Ukraine and  Hungary?    [Jeszenszky] Mr. Csurka is finished as a politician who many  times has shown the total erroneousness of his ideas. His  behavior at the time of the death of Premier Antall (he  organized a number of meetings that brutally attacked Antall's  accomplishments--the editors) cost him even the weak support  backing him. I would not overestimate the fact that he does not  support Hungarian foreign policy.    [Pawlowski] Istvan Csurka and Vladimir Zhirinovskiy--how do  they resemble each other and how do they differ?    [Jeszenszky] Zhirinovskiy knows at least a few foreign  languages, and Csurka not even one. Csurka is less dangerous  than Zhirinovskiy. Csurka was sharply criticized even before he  sharpened his tone and changed his words. I am trying to decide  whether it was that wave--maybe unjustly--that caused the  criticism, that radicalized him. What unites them--and Csurka  would deny this--is that they both draw attention to solving  problems in a fashion that does not exist, they give  prescriptions for healing the economy in an abstract manner,  stepping away from reality that is the way demagoguery is fed.  Both appeal to nationalistic feelings and set unrealistic goals.  Zhirinovskiy's tone is repulsive, speaking of war and force.  Csurka has never gone so far. Csurka is a softer, more  restrained version of Zhirinovskiy.    [Pawlowski] Sir, are you not worried that, with the growth  of  the popularity of Csurka and similar figures, the Hungarians may  cause problems for Europe? With their feeling of having been  hurt historically, the complex of [the Treaty of] Trianon, which  cut the size of Hungary by one-third; the dream of a Greater  Hungary,a country of 15 million inhabitants. Csurka speaks  loudly about things people want to hear. Is this true?    [Jeszenszky] To a large extent, the press created the Csurka  phenomenon. Csurka's popularity is hardly growing--quite the  contrary. I estimate his supporters to be below 5 percent. He  also has never spoken about a greater Hungary. It is another  matter entirely to speak of history's unfair treatment of  Hungary, period. The Poles were not treated any better. Csurka,  when he speaks about Hungarian minorities abroad, uses such  language because he thinks it will be more effective. But that  is all. Then comes the realistic way of thinking on which this  government stands as does the greater majority of Hungarian  society, a tolerant and patient one. [passage omitted]    [Pawlowski] Who is a Hungarian? Is it a question of blood,  language, or geography?    [Jeszenszky] He who speaks Hungarian and considers himself  one--just as in Poland during the time of the partitions, when  there was no country but the people kept their roots. In some  ways, Hungarians today are a divided people. This division  cannot be overcome by changing the borders, but by building a  European community, a united Europe in which Hungarians will not  feel divided and separated. [passage omitted]</p>

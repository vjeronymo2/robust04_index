			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Allied-Lyons trading profit sees 9.6% rise ALLIED-LYONS, the drinks, food and retailing group, achieved a 9.6 per cent increase in trading profits to Pounds 815m last year with strong performances in all its operations. Taxable profits of Pounds 610m compared with the previous year's Pounds 476m when Allied was hit by currency trading losses of Pounds 147m. The group reported yesterday that it had reached agreement with the Office of Fair Trading over the leasing of 734 pubs to Brent Walker, the leisure group. Arguments over the terms of the lease had threatened Allied's compliance with government orders requiring it to free 2,380 pubs from tied beer supplies. Earnings per share during the 53 weeks to March 7 grew to 41p from 40.5p. A final dividend of 13.35p makes a total of 20p for the year, 6.3 per cent up. The wines and spirits division improved margins and raised trading profits 10.2 per cent to Pounds 410m. Ballantine's whisky shipments were 5 per cent ahead with strong volume gains in Spain. Food profits rose 11.4 per cent to Pounds 147m with the sector's international spread cushioning it against tough trading conditions in the UK. The Dunkin Donuts and Baskin-Robbins franchise systems opened a further 400 stores, and saw a 10 per cent rise in sales to Pounds 1.3bn. Allied's brewing and pub retailing profits increased 7.9 per cent to Pounds 258m. An extraordinary charge of Pounds 79m for the reorganisation to meet the government's beer orders partially offset Pounds 31m of profits from pub property sales. Lex, Page 20</p>

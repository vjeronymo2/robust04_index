			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPANESE AGAIN BULLISH ON U.S. STOCKS;  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: A RESEARCH FIRM SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH JAPAN'S ECONOMY WILL OUTPACE THE  UNITED STATES' THROUGH '95, U.S. FIRMS WILL SHOW STRONGER PROFITS.  </P> <P> If you're looking for a place to invest in the 1990s, you might take notice  that the Japanese are once again bullish on corporate America.  </P> <P> So suggests a report from Nomura Research Institute, the research arm of Nomura  Securities, the world's largest brokerage and securities firm.  </P> <P> From it, smaller investors can glean tips on how a Japanese powerhouse research  firm sees the new decade unfolding in global economic terms.  </P> <P> Just when Americans are questioning whether their country is in decline, NRI  expects companies here will post stronger earnings gains than their Japanese  counterparts for the next five years.  </P> <P> Because of that and other factors, it says that U.S. stocks are undervalued --  significantly so. What's more, it says companies here are more competitive than  is widely believed -- thanks partly to healthy spending on research, sometimes  to catch up with Japanese companies.  </P> <P> "After we finished our research, we found potential in the U.S.," said Makoto  Hiranuma, manager at NRI's U.S. affiliate, Nomura Research Institute America  Inc.  </P> <P> Nomura officials disclosed the report's major findings, although the full  report will not be unveiled to investors in this country until February.  </P> <P> NRI's analysts combed reams of data on U.S. and Japanese companies. And their  basic conclusion was that while Japan's overall economic growth will double  that of the United States in the years through 1995, U.S. companies are better  positioned to show stronger earnings. NRI thinks that the growth of many  Japanese companies has peaked.  </P> <P> "We see a turning around in U.S. industry competitiveness since the mid-1980s,"  says Isao Yamamoto, a securities analyst at NRI.  </P> <P> Through the first half of the decade, the research firm projects that the net  earnings of 265 non-financial U.S. companies will grow an average of 13%,  outpacing the 7% rate projected for 400 companies in Japan.  </P> <P> Among NRI's top picks: Compaq Computer Corp., Cadence Design Systems Inc., Eli  Lilly &amp; Co., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Dow Chemical  Co., Toys R Us Inc., Merck &amp; Co. Inc. and Blockbuster Entertainment Corp.  </P> <P> NRI analysts concluded that the painful restructurings that many big U.S.  companies went through in the early and mid-1980s have paid off, leaving them  better positioned for the 1990s.  </P> <P> U.S. companies are forging valuable links with outside firms instead of taking  the go-it-alone approach of the past. NRI cites Compaq's ties with computer  dealers, relationships it says have given the computer maker valuable  information about customer needs.  </P> <P> In addition, companies here have learned some lessons -- namely, that it pays  to fashion a product to the needs and customs of foreign markets instead of  thinking that what's good for the United States is good for everyone else.  </P> <P> One example: Procter &amp; Gamble Co.'s "Dosing Ball," which dispenses liquid  detergent more evenly throughout the wash. The company developed the product  for Europe, which is dominated by front-loading machines. Front-loaders  generally work better with dry detergent but the ball has been well received,  helping P&amp;G sell more liquid products.  </P> <P> The Japanese researchers also noted that the sheer size of the United States,  with its 250 million people, gives companies such as discount retailer Wal-Mart  and others room to build their sales and earnings.  </P> <P> "The market is bigger. Your land is bigger," said Hiranuma. "Your population is  twice as large as the Japanese population."  </P> <P> It is not just Nomura that is bullish on America. Merrill Lynch chief  investment strategist Charles Clough is, as well.  </P> <P> "The big advantage that the U.S. is going to have is our interest rates are  going to be lower, and our costs of manufacturing are going to be lower," he  said.  </P> <P> Clough reckons that a drop in private borrowing by consumers will allow  domestic interest rates to fall.  </P> <P> "If that happens, you're going to see a lot of investment flow here," he said,  adding that more money is already flowing here from abroad.  </P> <P> In one recent example, Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. agreed to buy  entertainment giant MCA Inc. for $6.13 billion. The deal will be the biggest  foreign takeover by a Japanese company.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nomura's Picks  </P> <P> Nomura Research Institute, the research arm of the world's largest brokerage,  Nomura Securities, has assembled a report that recommends investing in U.S.  stocks. Following are the report's forecasts of the average annual earnings  growth for five domestic companies for the years 1990-95:  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.54IN:1.78IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Company  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Growth  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Cadence Design Systems  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 30%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Blockbuster  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 28%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Compaq Computer  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 23%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Bristol-Myers Squibb  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 21%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Merck &amp; Co.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 18%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

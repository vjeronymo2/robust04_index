			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / International Company News: Sir Robert Jones to step down from RJI SIR ROBERT Jones, executive chairman of Robt. Jones Investments (RJI) of New Zealand, announced his retirement at Friday's annual meeting. Sir Robert founded the company 10 years ago, and built it into the biggest listed property group in Australia and New Zealand, although he had it delisted from the Australian Stock Exchange in 1990 following a dispute. Sir Robert, 53, said he was retiring to 'go fishing and write books'. He said his departure would save the company money, a reference to his substantial management contract. After Sir Robert's resignation, the New Zealand Stock Exchange surveillance panel censured him and Mr David Moriarty, RJI managing director, over their handling of a number of property deals.</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: SBC forecasts drop in income Swiss Bank Corporation, Switzerland's third largest bank, said annual consolidated net income for 1994 would be 'clearly below' last year's record SFr1.37bn (Dollars 1.1bn). SBC said operating income after nine months failed to match 1993's performance. The bank was echoing recent statements from Switzerland's two other large banks. No figures were given, but the bank blamed the uncertainty in financial markets for most of the decline. The trend of trading income was the same as in the first half of the year, when it tumbled 63 per cent. Income from securities trading picked up in the third quarter, but revenues from foreign exchange were down. Net commission income, up 11 per cent in the first half, was down in the third quarter because of a fall in brokerage and syndication and placement fees. Net interest income was higher than in the first and second quarters of this year due to a more favourable funding structure and falling interest provisions, but remained lower than in the third quarter of last year. There was a further drop in bad loan provisions in the third quarter after the 53 per cent cut in the first half. Total assets of the parent company at September 30 stood at SFr195.5bn, SFr13.3bn higher than at the end of last year. Growth in domestic lending and interbank business offset the adverse affect of the lower US dollar, and the acquisition of a Swiss regional bank added SFr4.7bn.</p>

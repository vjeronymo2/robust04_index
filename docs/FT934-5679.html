			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / People: Attali's soft landing at Banque Arjil Bernard Attali, the ex-head of Air France, who recently fell from government grace when his austerity plan for the loss-making state carrier provoked a bitter strike, has parachuted comfortably into the job of chairing the supervisory board of Banque Arjil, an investment bank controlled by Jean-Luc Lagardere and his Matra-Hachette conglomerate, writes David Buchan. Attali's arrival at Banque Arjil was far more gentlemanly than his departure from Air France, and was apparently at the suggestion of the person he is replacing at the investment bank, his old friend, Philippe Camus. The latter decided he could do without the banking job and devote more time to the two more senior posts he occupies in the Lagardere empire - director general of Matra-Hachette, and head of the Lagardere group's financial committee. Interested though he may be in finance - he headed the GAN insurance group before going to Air France - Bernard Attali will hardly find the part-time supervisory job at Banque Arjil fully occupying. He might therefore find time to write up his airline experiences. After all, instant books run in the family. Twin brother Jacques is rumoured to be hammering away at his memoirs on his ill-starred time in London at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.</p>

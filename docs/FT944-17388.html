			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / UK Company News: L&amp;G Ventures Legal &amp; General Ventures has completed its takeover of Group Development Capital investment trust, which it plans to turn into a vehicle for investing primarily in companies recently floated by management buy-out and buy-in teams. Legal &amp; General's cash offer of 54.12p (97.5 per cent of asset value) per ordinary share has become unconditional. It values the trust at about Pounds 13.25m. An issue of new ordinary shares in the trust raised more than Pounds 18m, of which Pounds 9m was from Legal &amp; General Assurance, which has a 49.01 per cent stake. Warrants were issued to new and existing shareholders in a ratio of three warrants for every 20 ordinary shares. An extraordinary general meeting this week approved the trust's change in investment policy and the transfer of the management contract to Legal &amp; General Ventures. Dealings in the new shares and warrants are due to start on October 17.</p>

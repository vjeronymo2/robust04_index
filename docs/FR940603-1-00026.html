			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An ineligible vessel used in the IFQ sablefish and halibut fixed gear fisheries would be issued a restricted groundfish and crab vessel permit. A vessel that is issued a restricted groundfish and crab vessel permit would not be able to retain an aggregate amount of moratorium species other than sablefish and halibut in round weight equivalents in excess of 20 percent of the aggregate amount of sablefish and halibut in round weight equivalents on board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Letter of Authorization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If a vessel owner submits a complete application for a vessel permit or license, and NMFS preliminarily determines that a vessel is an ineligible vessel, NMFS would send a Letter of Authorization to a vessel owner authorizing a vessel to harvest moratorium species. A Letter of Authorization would allow a vessel owner who applies for a moratorium vessel permit or license to continue operating his vessel until NMFS makes a decision regarding its moratorium qualification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS would send a Letter of Authorization to the vessel owner within 30 days of receipt of the application, if NMFS has not issued a written initial decision to the vessel owner regarding his vessel's qualification. This Letter of Authorization would be in effect until superseded or rescinded by the Regional Director.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a vessel owner files a notice of appeal with the Regional Director, NMFS would send a Letter of Authorization to the vessel owner within 30 days of the filing of the appeal with NMFS, pending issuance of a written final decision to the vessel owner on the appeal. This Letter of Authorization would expire 30 days after the Regional Director issues a written final decision on the appeal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Appeals Procedure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS proposes the following appeals procedure to implement the Council's appeal provisions. A vessel owner may appeal the initial denial of a groundfish and crab vessel permit, the issuance of a restricted halibut vessel license, or the issuance of a restricted groundfish and crab vessel permit to the Regional Director within 45 days of issuance of written notice from NMFS or the IPHC. The Regional Director would decide the appeal on a review of the records submitted, and issue a written decision on the appeal. If the Regional Director were to determine that in deciding the appeal, his decision would benefit from industry input, the Regional Director would forward the appeal to the Appeals Board. NMFS proposes that the Appeals Board would be a committee of the Council comprised of three appointed Council Advisory Panel members. The Appeals Board would meet publicly to discuss the appeal. After receiving the Appeals Board's recommendation from the Council, the Regional Director would consider the recommendation and issue a written decision on the appeal. The Regional Director's decision would constitute the final agency action upon which the applicant would be able to file suit in U.S. District Court.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice of a proposed rule that would govern appeals of determinations made for the IFQ program was published on February 9, 1994 (59 FR 5979). Public comment is particularly requested on using the same appeals procedure for the IFQ and moratorium programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Classification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, determined that this proposed rule, if adopted, could have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Based on the EA/RIR/IRFA for the moratorium, total participation in the moratorium fisheries for a given year is influenced by the annual rate of entrance and exit of vessels. Although new entrants averaged nearly 900 vessels annually over the period from 1977 through 1991, total participation increased only 180 vessels per year, on average, because 500 to 1,000 vessels exited the fisheries annually.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Vessel participation data for 1992 have become available since this analysis was performed. The source of these data are the State of Alaska fish ticket, NMFS groundfish vessel permit, weekly production report, and catch estimate databases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1991, 2,227 vessels fished in Alaska Federal groundfish fisheries, and in 1992, 2,341 vessels fished, for an increase in 1992 of 114 vessels. Approximately half (46 vessels) of this increase is due to vessels less than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA. Such vessels normally do not make a significant contribution to the overall landings of groundfish. In addition, vessels less than 26 ft (7.9 m) LOA in the GOA and those less than 32 ft (9.8 m) LOA in the BSAI area would be exempt from the moratorium. After subtracting such small vessels and considering only those newly permitted vessels that made recorded groundfish landings in 1992, only about 27 vessels apparently entered the groundfish fishery in 1992 for the first time, and would not be eligible to fish under the moratorium. With respect to halibut, about 156 ``new'' vessels made landings for the first time in 1992 (some of these had groundfish and crab landings records also). With respect to BSAI crab, eight ``new'' vessels made landings for the first time in 1992. Therefore, a total of about 191 vessels apparently entered the groundfish, halibut, and crab fisheries for the first time in 1992 and may not be eligible for a license if the moratorium is approved and implemented as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The number of ``new'' vessels that entered these fisheries in 1993 and 1994 is unknown because individual vessel catch data are still preliminary. Assuming that roughly the same number of ``new'' vessels entered these fisheries in 1993 and 1994 as entered in 1992 probably is unrealistic. The Council's moratorium decision occurred midway through 1992. Most fishermen decide whether to enter a fishery at the beginning of the year. Public knowledge of the Council's action after June 1992 probably had a negative effect on a decision to enter a ``new'' vessel in 1993 or 1994. According to the NMFS vessel permit database, about 447 Federal groundfish vessel permits were issued between February 9, 1992, and March 21, 1994, that had never before obtained a groundfish vessel permit. However, the majority of these ``new'' vessel permits likely were issued to halibut longline vessels, which would be exempt from the moratorium when the halibut IFQ program is fully implemented in 1995. In addition, some unknown number of these ``new'' groundfish vessel permits were never used to actually harvest and land groundfish, and others were issued to small vessels that would be exempt from the moratorium. For the reasons described above, the number is likely more than 35, but less than 100, based on the available data and knowledge of the fisheries.

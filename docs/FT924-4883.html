			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Stock Exchange may close USM: Recommendation follows a decline in interest of investors THE STOCK EXCHANGE is set to recommend the closure of the Unlisted Securities Market, the UK's junior market, in a consultative document to be issued in the next few weeks. The action follows regulatory changes and declining interest by investors and companies in the USM, founded 12 years ago to help entrepreneurs gain access to the UK equity markets. Final approval for the recommendation must still be made by the stock exchange quotations committee and the board, chaired by Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, before a document is issued for public consultation. Unless there are strong objections, that could lead to closure of the market to new issues by mid-1993, with a transition period of at least another year before all companies are moved to the main market or delisted. The stock exchange launched a review of the USM early this year, writing to canvass views from all of the roughly 330 remaining companies on the market and many other practitioners. The result is believed to have shown a clear consensus that many companies on the USM wanted to move off it, while others had little interest in joining, leaving questions about the quality of those that remained. It highlighted the fact that the remaining regulatory distinctions between the main market and the USM have eroded and the difficulties in transferring from one to the other have reduced substantially. Many brokers are already advising USM applicants to comply with the exchange's full listing requirements. The exchange refused to confirm the contents of the document yesterday but said: 'We have undertaken an enormous amount of research on the USM. There have been many changes since it was introduced. We have to see whether there is still the need for a distinct regulatory regime.' The future of the USM has been in doubt since the late 1980s with the end of the stock market boom. In the past three years, the number of companies quoted has fallen by a third and the value of the market has halved. Only four companies joined in the first two quarters this year. The Third Market, which was created in 1987 to provide equity for start-up businesses, never managed to take off and was closed at the end of 1990. The document is expected to raise hopes that many companies could transfer to a full stock exchange listing. That will become easier after this autumn's new regulations. There are still some concerns about the tax implications of transferring, but they are not considered a significant hindrance by the exchange. Whizzkid's haven, Page 17</p>

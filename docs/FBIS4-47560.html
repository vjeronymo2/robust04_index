Shelyag-Sosonko, Botany Institute at the Ukrainian Academy  of Sciences, Kiev; UDC 574.64(28)]    [Abstract] The unique ability of the northern Black Sea  river vegetation to serve as amelioration plants in a region  which otherwise has very limited natural vegetation resources  due to the macrophytes' ability to accumulate chemical compounds  and elements, particularly heavy metals entering the river  basins with waste water, prompted an attempt to characterize the  distribution of heavy metals accumulated by the Phragmites  australis reed which covers 30-70% of the undisturbed  territories of the rivers' floodplain and littoral landscape. To  this end, samples were taken at 1 km intervals during a study of  the compact Ph. australis proliferation area on the  Danube, Dnepr, Dnestr, and Don rivers and at 5 km interval in  the Kuban region. The findings were extrapolated, the heavy  metal concentration was quantified, and charts were plotted  using an SM-4 computer. The heavy metal (Pb, Mo, Cu, Zn, Ni, and  Mn) distribution in various river estuaries near the northern  coast of the Black sea is plotted, and the total Ph.  australis area and primary production in the estuaries and  gross heavy metal accumulation in estuarine Ph.  australis are summarized. It is noted that the ever-growing  exposure of the river basin ecosystem to man-caused factors  increases the urgency of such studies in the future.

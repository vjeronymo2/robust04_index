			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / International Company News: Canadian group raises claim against TML ESC Wagons, the consortium building shuttle-train carriages for the Channel tunnel, has raised the amount of its legal claim against TransManche-Link, the tunnel's main contractor, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. Bombardier, the Canadian transport group which heads ESC, said yesterday it was still trying to negotiate a settlement of the dispute over additional work required to meet TML's changed specifications. But Bombardier said it planned to press its claim in court if it did not receive 'an early and positive reaction'. ESC is claiming a total of FFr3.39bn (Dollars 584.5m), compared with the FFr2bn claimed last December. The company said the difference reflected further 'delays and disruptions resulting from TML's actions'.</p>

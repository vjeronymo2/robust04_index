			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] In its editorial today under the headline "Israeli  Lies," TISHRIN speaks about claims of U.S. Jewish organizations  about the living conditions of Jews in Syria.    The paper says these claims are part of a systematic  campaign  to create confusion and cast doubt on Syria and its positions  that call for achieving a just and comprehensive peace, as well  as putting an end to Israeli attempts to blow up the peace  process.    TISHRIN asserts that when Israel raises doubts about the  situation of Jews in Syria, it knows well that it will only reap  failure and will not be able to exonerate itself of the crimes  it is committing in broad daylight against Arab citizens and  holy shrines.    Noting the massacres Israel itself has committed against  Jews  to drive them to emigrate to Palestine, the paper says: We  recall these official practices only to assert that Israel and  its terrorist and extremist organizations seek --by propagating  their illusions that Syrian Jews are in danger -- to distract  attention from the denunciation and condemnation of what it did  at the Ibrahimi Mosque and the Sayyidat al-Najat Church. The  whole world regards the unbelievable Israeli aggression against  the Palestinian people in the occupied territories with anger,  rage, and suspicion.    The paper adds: The world, and the Jews of Syria, have  acknowledged that they are living in their homeland and enjoying  full peace and security. Israel has no right to fabricate lies  and launch claims and falsehoods about the status of Jews in  Syria, because they form an indivisible part of the Syrian  people and enjoy, without discrimination, all rights of  citizenship to travel, movement, ownership, responsibilities,  work, and residence. The Jews of Syria are in no need of  misleading Israeli claims. They have said that they do not  accept any substitute for their homeland, Syria, and they are  capable of producing evidence to reply to Israeli lies.    The paper concludes: Israel should be the first party to  acknowledge that it entertains illusions about what is it  saying. The result will be similar to cultivating the sea. Its  lies, no matter how skillfully fabricated, can fool no one.  Israel is facing the results of its own terrorism and is held  responsible for its crimes and massacres.</p>

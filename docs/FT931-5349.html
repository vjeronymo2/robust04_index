			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Promised Glasgow army jobs in jeopardy GLASGOW is to continue fighting to persuade the army to locate its new personnel centre in the city, creating 700 jobs, after Mr Archie Hamilton, the armed forces minister, confirmed that the army was considering an alternative site in Stockport, near Manchester. Amid accusations from Scottish politicians of all parties that the government was reneging on a decision made only six weeks ago, Mr Hamilton said the ministry had only recently become aware of a existence of a suitable building in Stockport which would cost Pounds 4m against Pounds 20m for the one earmarked in Glasgow. He indicated that it was likely that the army would settle for Stockport, although the recommendation was still subject to review. It was important that the taxpayer received value for money. In January the army said it was recommending Glasgow as the site of its new unified personnel centre to handle all army pay and pensions. It said it would lead to the closure of several smaller offices around Britain, but 700 new jobs would be created in Glasgow and 400 existing MoD jobs in the city would be safeguarded. It was expected that the centre would be located in Tay House, a large new office building standing empty in the heart of the city. Mr Hamilton said the ministry had always made clear that the original recommendation was subject to a period of review. During that period the ministry's consultants had become aware of a suitable vacant building in Stockport. which they had not known about. The decision to give Stockport serious consideration has infuriated Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, who next week will announce the government's plans for improved constitutional arrangements for Scotland, which are widely expected not to satisfy the opposition parties. The Glasgow development agency, which was helping the army find a location for its new centre, said yesterday it had offered the army several buildings, some of which were cheaper than the one eventually chosen. 'We were always told that they wanted a modern building to take them into the 21st century,' the agency said yesterday. It believes that the Pounds 4m building in Stockport is a 1970s structure. 'We will go back and make our submission all over again,' the agency said. Meanwhile there were indications yesterday that the government will next week announce the transfer of some of the civil servants concerned with regulating the North Sea oil industry from London to Aberdeen. But the proposed transfer appeared to amount to less than that urged by Scottish politicians. Mr Bob Middleton, convener of Grampian regional council, which includes Aberdeen, said he understood that a cabinet committee had agreed on Thursday that between 30 and 40 civil servants' posts would be moved from London to Aberdeen. That is fewer than the 80-odd civil servants in the petroleum engineering division of the Department of Trade and Industry's energy section, whose transfer to Aberdeen has long been a demand of businessmen and politicians in north-east Scotland.</p>

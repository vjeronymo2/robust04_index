Chokchai said there are bright  prospects for Thai investment in China in areas such as factory  development, infrastructure construction, and retailing. Thai  investors can also export construction materials for projects in  China. Simultaneously, there are good opportunities for Chinese  entrepreneurs to invest in Thailand to produce goods for export  to Indochina. This will help save transportation costs.    Moreover, China's cooperation with ASEAN countries and the  quadrangle economic development project invovling China,  Thailand, Laos, and Burma will enable this region to become an  important area of greater economic prosperity. Now, some Thai  products such as motorcycles, kitchen ware, consumer products,  and construction materials have penetrated the Indochinese  market. However, countries in each region have set up regional  trade groups. This has prompted Thailand to enhance its  competitiveness in the market by improving development analyses  or relocating production bases to other countries with cheaper  labor costs. Labor cost in Thailand is much higher than in  neighboring countries.    The Chinese chief delegate said Wuxi city has registered the  rapid economic growth rate of 25 percent, the highest in Jiangsu  Province. There are over 140,000 factories in the city. There  are also some 3,669 foreign-owned factories with a combined  investment of U.S. $2,900 million. Chinese entrepreneurs are  interested in investing in metallurgical and rubber industries  in Thailand.</p>

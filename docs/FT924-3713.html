			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Cookery: Pheasant thoughts from the larder WHEN I wrote recently about rabbit in preference to pheasant, some strong letters resulted. 'Pheasant is the only meat this kitchen will see between now and Christmas,' laments one. 'My larder is a flurry of feathers and the freezer is full,' writes another. Now I relent, and I hope that the following recipes may help a little. But first a suggestion. In some households, there is a rule that whoever shoots the bird also plucks and draws it. Perhaps the time has come for an addendum: whoever shoots it plucks, draws, cooks and eats it - and washes up afterwards. PHEASANT PASTITSIO This is a comforting dish for a shooting lunch or a Saturday lunch party at home, and it is convenient for the cook as it can be prepared ahead and re-heated for serving. For six-eight people, take two well hung pheasants and roast or braise them, depending on age. Take care not to overcook them. Cut off the legs and save them for another recipe, such as the one given below. Strip the meat from the other parts and make a rich stock with the bones. Chop and fry a couple of onions in a little fat. Add a clove or two of finely-chopped garlic, 6-8 oz streaky bacon cut into matchsticks, and a few mushrooms, chopped or sliced. Stir well and pour on a generous glass of red wine. Let it bubble up and cook until most of the liquid has been driven off. Add marjoram, thyme and about 7 1/2 fl oz of pheasant stock and simmer gently for about 20 minutes to make a rich sauce. Stir in the pheasant meat cut into chunks. Season, adding a squeeze of lemon or perhaps a splash of brandy, and set aside. Boil 9-10 oz of macaroni and arrest cooking by plunging the pasta in cold water afterwards. Then make a bechamel sauce with 2 oz each of butter and flour and 1 pt of milk infused with a bay leaf. Away from the heat, stir in 2 oz grated cheese (preferably a mixture of feta and Cheddar) followed by  1/4 - 1/2 pt yoghurt and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Mix in the macaroni. Put half the macaroni into a lasagne dish or similar. Cover with the pheasant mixture and finish with the remaining macaroni. To reheat for serving, scatter coarse, slightly stale breadcrumbs all over the surface and bake at 375``F/190`C (gas mark 5) for 45 minutes or so until piping hot. TWO-HANDED PHEASANT SANDWICH This is good food to slip into the pocket of a Barbour when spending the day with one of those small syndicate shoots where each gun brings his own nosebag. A flask of hot soup, a slice each of fruit cake and cheese, and an apple would complete the picnic menu nicely. For each person toast, two thick slices of bread and cool them. Butter one lavishly and close carpet it with watercress, pressing the greenery down onto the butter. Spread the other slice with generous dollops of chutney and pile onto it plenty of cold, cooked pheasant meat. (Any part of the bird can be used, but I find this sandwich is a good vehicle for using up the leg meat, stripped carefully of sinew). Invert the first slice over the second, press firmly together, and wrap in greaseproof paper and foil for carrying. MUSHY PEA SOUP For a portable lunch on a chilly day's shooting, or to put good heart and good voice into a group of carol singers, this is most satisfying (if porridgy thick). A thinner version, scattered with croutons of fried bread or snippets of grilled bacon, is perhaps more suited to serving in the dining room. To serve six, soak  3/4 -1 lb marrowfat peas overnight: the larger the quantity, the thicker the soup. Choose a heavy pot and warm in it a spoonful or two of fat: goose or duck fat, melted bacon fat, olive oil or butter. Sweat a large, finely-chopped onion in the fat. Stir in the soaked and drained peas. Pour on 2 1/4 pt liquid, ideally a mixture of leftover gravy and stock. Cover and simmer gently for 45 minutes until the peas start to collapse to a mush. Stir now and then to prevent the mixture from sticking. Process the contents of the pan to a mealy puree, as smooth or as knobbly as you wish, and season before reheating for serving.</p>

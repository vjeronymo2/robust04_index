			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> West Germany is preparing to charge a former U.S. Army sergeant with treason  for his alleged role in a spy ring that sold North Atlantic Treaty Organization  secrets to the Soviets, Der Spiegel magazine reported. The Hamburg-based  publication said federal prosecutors in Karlsruhe are preparing to charge Clyde  Lee Conrad, 42, a native of Sebring, Ohio, who was arrested in August, 1988.  Der Spiegel said it would be the first time in West German history that a  foreigner faced such charges. Authorities suspect that Conrad acted as  ringleader of an international spy network that sold the Soviets information  about NATO's nuclear missiles, bases and troop strengths.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Reporter Zdenko Vranjes reports on the talks on the  status of Mostar and on the Croat-Muslim exchange of prisoners:    [Vranjes] In talks with Herceg-Bosna Prime Minister Jadranko  Prlic, Minister Mile Akmadzic, and Mayor of Mostar Stojan Vrlic,  members of the EU [European Union] delegation stressed they were  satisfied with the evident readiness on both sides to approach  the Washington agreement -- regarding Mostar -- sincerely and  cooperatively. This will facilitate the task of the EU, which  wishes, in an impartial way, to accelerate the normalization of  life in Mostar, said Greek Ambassador Dimitros Rales, who leads  the three-member EU delegation in its mission to investigate the  situation on the ground before the EU begins the first steps to  establish its administration.    The members of the EU delegation toured the east part of  Mostar and held talks with the Muslim authorities. Croat  representatives at the talks raised the issue of significant  changes in the national composition of the population of Mostar,  caused by the arrival from eastern Herzegovina of Muslim  refugees and displaced persons, which, in the opinion of the  Croat side, had been the cause of the months-long conflict. We  guess that it will be important to agree who will return and who  will stay and live in Mostar.    The second round of the prisoner exchange, agreed on in  Uskopje between the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] and the  Bosnian Muslim side, took place today. The 251 prisoners  released by the Croats from Rodoc, near Mostar, arrived in the  eastern part of Mostar in zUNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]  vehicles this afternoon. The Muslim side released six HVO  members from Gornji Vakuf. Another 32 Croat prisoners released  from Vares are expected to arrive in Kiseljak this afternoon, as  well as 315 Croat civilians who took refuge at the UNPROFOR base  in Carici near Kakanj during the Muslim offensive last year.</p>

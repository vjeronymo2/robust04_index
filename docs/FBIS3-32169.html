Velasquez at the National Congress in Caracas -- live]    [Text] Honorable National Congress President; Honorable  National Congress Vice President; Honorable Supreme Court of  Justice Magistrates; Mr. Supreme Electoral Council President;  His Eminence Cardinal Jose Ali Lebrum, archbishop of Caracas;  Mr. Attorney General of the Republic; Mr. Presidents and  Magistrates of the Judiciary Council; former Presidents of the  Republic; former Presidents of the Government Council; Ministers  of the Executive Cabinet; Honorable Federal District Governor;  Honorable State Governors; Honorable Comptroller General of the  Republic; Honorable District Attorney General of the Republic;  His Excellency Nuncio and Papal Representative; Honorable  Ambassadors; Honorable Charges d'Affaires; Representatives of  International Organizations; Honorable Senators and National  Congress Deputies; Honorable Metropolitan Mayors; Officers,  Generals, Admirals, Members of the Military High Command;  National Academy Presidents and Directors; National University  Presidents; Honorable Bishops and Archbishops; Executive Office  Director General; Presidents of State Autonomous Institutions  and Corporations; Media Representatives; Special Guests; Ladies  and Gentlemen: I come here today to address you as part of my  duties, but at the same time I am here today to express my  satisfaction.    Seven months ago the Constitution imposed a duty on me,  which  I swore to honor. That is why I am here today to present a  state of the nation address as well as a report on the Executive  Branch's performance during the period that I was responsible  for directing the nation. This feeling of satisfaction  overwhelms me. I feel it just as if I were an ordinary citizen.  In a few days time I will return to being an average citizen  and the same type of person I tried not to stray away from  during these past months when I became aware that I would be  part of the institutional succession mechanism. In saying  this, in no way am I trying to diminish the position's  importance or my personal responsibility. However, I seek to  highlight how Venezuela was able to confront a crisis of  historical dimensions and was able to defeat it by implementing,  through an exceptional effort, mechanisms that ensured that  governmental changes would take place in a peaceful and orderly  manner, such as in societies with a more mature democracies.    My administration developed as a result of that effort and  from that endorsement. In addition, normal democratic elections  were possible as a result of that effort. Also as a result of  that same effort and endorsement, my government was able to  fully carry out the duties imposed by the nation. In a few  days it will be my honor to place the presidential sash across  the chest of Dr. Rafael Caldera, an illustrious Venezuelan, an  expert in guiding the Republic, and a man unquestionably  anointed by the people's vote. His experience and his popular  anointment make me feel at peace in handing over the mandate.  The Republic was not lost by my hands, and I pass over the  command certain that Dr. Rafael Caldera will say the same when  his mandate concludes.    The origin of my mandate, which differs from those of  presidents who succeeded one another since 1959, gives this  ceremony a nature that goes beyond simple institutional routine.  Amid dramatic circumstances and dangerous general confusion,  the Legislative Branch chose one of its own -- me -- to honor  and gave him the historic responsibility of taking over the  Executive Branch for the remainder of the constitutional period  that started in February 1989.    Today I have come before the congressmen elected for the  1994-99 five-year period, and this appearance symbolizes the  ability of Venezuelan democracy to face a crisis and to build  its future.    This is why I will not just thank those who as  representatives of the nation and functioning in the midst of  the most serious institutional conflict our democracy has every  faced, placed their trust in a man who had never requested or  sought to occupy -- under very special circumstances -- the  presidency.    This is a thing of the past. It could be seen as a personal  expression of gratitude. I have to add, because this deals with  the future, that I am certain, and I hope the country is too,  that with the installation of the new parliament and the  forthcoming presidential inauguration we will be taking a giant  step toward the consolidation of Venezuela's institutions.    This is not a more or less official expression of optimism  or  a rhetorical statement. I know that in very important sectors  of the nation there still exist the huge crisis factors that  produced my brief government period. My government came to  power under circumstances that obstructed its work from the very  beginning. The start of an administration would have to be  difficult if it did not have the two keystones that give  strength to governments in democratic countries: the  indisputable strength of an election victory and the backing  that party support provides for daily influence of public  opinion. Not only this, my administration emerged in a context  capable of making not only the government, but also the state,  appear weak.    Other factors were to appear during this brief and unique  presidential period. These factors were against the traditional  appearance of presidential authority. On the one hand, the  image of the Executive Branch had changed because state  governors are now being elected directly; and on the other, the  privatization of the big public enterprises had taken from the  president a traditional source of power. At the same time,  there were social demands that could not be met quickly because  a treasury deficit created difficulties and problems could not  be resolved or commitments could not be fulfilled as quickly and  as easily as before.    In addition there was the unrest that prevailed in the  country following the February 1992 events and as a result of  the institutional crisis of June 1993. In addition, there was  the new economic situation, the daily deterioration of the  family budget, and the state of hopelessness in the middle class.    During the past few months, all this resulted in continuous  observations about the frailty of the new government, the small  probabilities of the government lasting until the November  elections, and the paralyzing and anguishing expectation about  what could happen at any moment.    The continuous consultations we held with all the sectors of  the national community and in all regions showed us, better than  polls, the reasons for absenteeism or electoral indifference  among a significant group of Venezuelans. It appeared that  democracy was going to succumb. New military rebellions were  feared, immediate strikes in important sectors were expected.    After a succession of partial strikes a date was set for a  general strike in the public sector. This, in effect, would  have spurred unpredictable consequences for the December  elections. Incidentally, I would like to clear up something now.  Those union demands did not respond to goals derived from the  people's needs. They were, as I said at that time, fair  aspirations but not feasible due to the serious fiscal crisis  and the growing Treasury deficit.    In addition, the country was appalled by the terrorist  threats that were perceived as a product of diverse  conspiracies. I would be lying if I said that my government,  even since its beginning, lacked total institutional or national  support. I was able to count on the initial support of the  Parliament, the support of the nation's Armed Forces, and the  support of the Catholic Church. These stimulated our  determination to progress on the road to transition because we  perceived that our goal to listen to demands and to hear  positions from all the nation's sectors and regions were more  than heard, they received satisfactory solutions.    The government I led was initiated with demands from  political sectors and the written press to make significant  changes. Most of these demands were in reference to scrapping  an economic program that the Congress had recently approved  through a series of legislative laws. Since the beginning I  warned that I was not a miracle worker, that I was a public  servant. I understood at that time that my government's main  objectives were, as they could not be otherwise, to reestablish  public peace by putting an emphasis on dialogue instead of  repression, to persist in negotiations to resolve and  restructure labor demands, to rehabilitate -- to the extent  possible -- public finances to prevent a halt in the payrolls  before December and thereby assure administrative continuity,  and to revive faith in the elections.    I believe that any judgment passed on the brief, but intense  administration that I have headed, should be based on the  explicit objectives that I was given. It was too short a term  to carry out significant programs in state organization, but was  a term committed to respond to the demands and risks of the  national emergency. Democratic will prevailed in the end and in  the 1993 electoral scenario the public presence of all the  existing Venezuelan political organizations of the nineties  surfaced.    The final acceptance of the election results meant the end  of  the most serious stage of the crisis that shook the nation.  This has allowed us to put an end to doubts and tensions,  thereby opening the road to a new chapter in our history.    These statements should not be taken as an assertion that  now  that the elections are over we live in the best possible world.  This would be an attempt to hide the concern resulting from  election abstention registered in official statistics. This is  of particular concern when it involves the younger Venezuelan  generation.    Both the willingness expressed by those who cast their votes  and the willingness not to vote, given their equal force, make  up a puzzling and difficult situation in our history. The  puzzling situation we are experiencing is that the possible  solutions entail important changes in the very system adopted by  our democracy to alleviate backwardness and injustice. This is  because more than 30 years have gone by since an experience  without precedent in Venezuelan history was initiated. This took  place at a time when there was a small population, a manageable  fiscal situation, absence of large social demands, and political  participation in a stage of clearly defined dimensions.    That situation disappeared and gave way to another reality  whose development is traumatic and unpredictable. As with any  beginning, this new period we are facing is characterized by the  urgent demands of the new Venezuelan society, and, therefore, a  redistribution of power is required. No dictatorship would have  endured the kind of crises that our democracy has endured in the  past three years.    I do not want you to think that what I will now say is the  product of some sort of professional or intellectual distortion  stemming from my passion for history that prompts me to yield to  the joy of making comparisons. I have had the privilege of  experiencing two major crises in our democratic system, and in  both of them the circumstances placed me in the very eye of the  hurricane. I was a protagonist and a witness at the same time,  as a public man and as interpreter of history: The first time, I  served as secretary general of the Presidency of the Republic  beginning in 1959, and the second time I served as president of  the Republic.    This has allowed me to monitor closely and experience not  only the events, but also to see their hidden sides. This has  allowed me to recall -- and I am recalling this before you --  that we are not experiencing an unknown situation and that  during the first five years of the democratic period -- in the  early 1960's -- the country was rocked by a deep crisis as a  result of national changes and world developments -- as is the  case with the current crisis -- that caused serious political  conflicts.    In those years, there were numerous military insurgencies,  terrorist actions, and guerrilla activity fostered by the  enthusiasm generated Fidel Castro's triumph in Cuba and by a  fiscal and economic crisis that forced the government to adopt  special measures.    Despite the seriousness of the events of that five-year  period, they were met by a national community that had not long  ago come out of a decade of dictatorship to which it did not  wish to return. That is why this national community thought it  had found a cure for all of its evils in that new political  period.    Behind that backdrop there was determination to persist in  democracy and liberty, and this was reflected in the  establishment of a political pact by which the most powerful  political parties, despite their differences and without  disclaiming that disputes existed among them, managed to unite  to face conflicts that situations of this sort always provoke,  but at that time they appeared to be so new and unprecedented.    That collective will and that political pact brought three  decades of stability to the democratic system and the changes in  our society and the opening of the political system -- with all  of their faults and inconsistencies -- have been achieved  through institutional means.    That pact is virtually nonexistent today, and we do not yet  have another one to replace it. The country has changed  significantly in all areas. These significant transformations  could have affected its political life in the recent elections.  Dr. Rafael Caldera enjoyed the support of a group outside the  traditional majority parties, and at Congress there is now a  balance of four and not only two coordinated groups.    The democratic model mentioned in the Constitution and the  pact that strengthened it have become limited, while civilian  awareness and the people's participation in the continuous  exercise of democracy have matured. The people no longer  comprise a more or less passive body that is only evident at  election time. Rather, the population now is the direct  promoter of public activity, as well as a not very reverential  critic.    This is why we cannot postpone decentralization, the  development of the electoral system, promotion of greater  democratization of parties and unions, drastic reduction in  government size, and fostering complete honesty in  administrative and judicial procedures. This profound change  coincides, and not by chance, with a weakening of the  protectionist, profit-oriented [rentista], and inward-growing  model based on petroleum and of a spendthrift state that ended  up pouring on that complex process of transformations the fuel  of inflation, deterioration of services, and insecurity.    Though these may be growing pains, which when handled in an  enlightened fashion may lead us to higher stages of development  and higher levels of life, it has not been easy to make people  understand the need to establish an austere system -- not a  patronage system -- based instead on productive work. The  excessive custodianship of the state and the unproductivity  hidden by massive official aid have been ruinous practices that  have structurally weakened the treasury and tend to give the  deficit a chronic nature.    The worrisome events of February 1989, as well as those that  took place in February and November 1992, are manifestations  that, although unusual, brought to light before the December  elections the major changes many of us had foreseen -- seen  through the naked eye, without pessimistic considerations. Those  threats that seemed a thing of the past in our political life  may prove beneficial to democracy, with all the violence in  which they took place. If we succeed in understanding them, they  add pressing reasons for the need for a national consensus to  change.    The process of decentralization. That process of in-depth  political change that has been taking place in the country has  been fundamentally manifested in the direct election of  governors and mayors since 1989. That political event -- no  doubt the most important in our democratic history since the  introduction of universal and direct suffrage to elect our  representatives in 1947 -- falling within the framework of the  state reform proposals I was honored to promote in the  Presidential Commission for State Reform in late 1988, has set  the stage for a new era, one of an democratic but also  decentralized and participative state.    The decentralization policy of my administration stems from  my conviction that thanks to this process, the experienced  political change has occurred in a democratic manner. The real  modifications that have taken place in the political state will  begin to be felt in the constitutional period that is beginning.    Aware of the irreversible presence of this consensus for  institutional transformation, I imprinted on the  decentralization process during the months of my mandate all the  momentum possible as the democratic tool of the inevitable  political evolution. I appointed a state minister for  decentralization to guide this process on behalf of the  government, to propose the necessary political and government  decisions, and to establish new grounds for the  intergovernmental relations the new state required, where the  government of the Republic is not merely the national government  but is a government together with the state and municipal  governments, as part of a public, single, and overall public  authority that is no longer vertical, but constitutionally  distributed in a horizontal manner in the territory of the  Republic.    The decentralization charter of 1989. During my months in  office, this law was implemented and complemented through  regulations I issued through the Council of Ministers. The bases  were established for the process of transferring national  jurisdiction and services to states and municipalities, and  mechanisms were regulated in a smooth manner to advance the  necessary intergovernmental relations between the national,  state, and municipal authority bodies. The creation of the  Territorial Government Council, National Mayors' Council, and  the Council of Government for metropolitan Caracas stemmed from  there.    By the same token, agreements were signed with five states  transferring public health services. We signed another agreement  on care for children and senior citizens. In addition, the  national and state organizations signed many agreements to  relieve clogging of services.    Urgent fiscal action. The implementation of deficit  budgets in the past few years reached a critical point in the  second half of 1993, coinciding with my government. Doubts  were raised concerning the possibility of adequately repaying  domestic and foreign obligations, including the payment of the  public administration's payroll and year-end special  remunerations. Several solutions to the fiscal problem were  carefully studied within the short time available. In view of  the impossibility of significantly cutting expenses, the  government resorted to establishing taxes on the nonoil sector.  This was feasible, considering the low fiscal pressure on this  sector. Consequently, and by way of congressional  authorization, I issued decree-laws at ministerial council  meetings, which established value-added taxes [VAT] and taxes on  corporation assets. Other decrees enforced the new Banking Law,  the Fiscal Stamp Law, and the Judicial Tariff Law.    One of the VAT's characteristics, among others, is its  immediate and easy collection. Its destiny now depends on what  this sovereign Congress may decide. The tax on enterprises'  assets is, more than anything else, a means for preventing  income tax evasion.    Meanwhile, the taxes stipulated by laws to reform the Fiscal  Stamps Law and Judicial Tariff Law were updated and fine-tuned.  Efficiently and on a short-term basis, the new taxes not only  provided resources to meet urgent fiscal needs, but they also  decisively contributed to the placement of securities issued in  1992 and 1993 -- securities which had seen little acceptance.  Late in 1993, it became possible to place those securities  because investors realized the Venezuelan Government would be in  a better position to pay its obligations. On a mid-term basis,  and in addition to helping correct the fiscal deficit, this  placement can ease the refinancing of the debt by resulting in  better fiscal control, an essential condition to meet this  objective.    In the area of expenditures, numerous allocations were  declared nonfeasible. This made it possible to finance greater  priority needs. These additional resources were used to complete  the financing of the electoral process and the Republic Plan,  meet the state universities' requests, create a single  compensation bonus, and raise salaries according to collective  contracts. The public budget already runs in the millions,  while fiscal revenue sources have not yet been diversified.  Expenditures exceeded fiscal revenues during 1992 and 1993.  The corresponding deficit materialized in payment orders worth  more than 180 billion bolivares. The tremendous nature of the  fiscal crisis and the shortness of my term made it impossible to  tackle this problem fully.    The budget approved for 1994 is based on estimated general  revenues that proved unrealistic as soon as the weakness of the  international oil market determined a drop in both sales volume  and the price of our oil. To top it off, a large portion of the  special revenues anticipated for the complementary financing of  this budget also proved unrealistic. All of this makes us  expect another worrisome fiscal deficit. The new leaders of the  nation must urgently find in-depth solutions and new and  dependable sources of income, while, at the same time, finding  areas where public expenditures can be reduced and other budget  credit requirements are met. These leaders must carry out an  dauntless fiscal reorganization based on modern tax schemes and  resource-utilization plans which might correct the downturn that  has taken place in the recent past.  <H5>  The Task Accomplished </H5>   I want to emphasize the task accomplished during the short  and conflicting duration of the administration I presided over  by those who accompanied me in the government tasks. In the  work done in different sectors, they did not show any interest  other than serving Venezuela. They knew they could not count on  the support of any parties, and they were aware of the great  responsibility of the government they formed.    Public order was maintained and relations with all political  sectors were maintained within an atmosphere of understanding,  respect, and broad-mindedness. We fulfilled our international  commitment and increased our leading presence in the Latin  American economic integration process. We reached fundamental  accords in the agricultural and auto manufacturing sectors. In  terms of the health sector, we worked enthusiastically, and this  translated into standards that took into account the growth of  demand, the definitive application of national law on this  matter, and the demands for decentralization.    Concerning the areas of education, social work, and labor  relations, we responded to demands with programs,  notwithstanding the growing limitation of fiscal resources. The  extensive report accompanying my message and the notes and  reports of the ministers deal with these government  administration aspects. The detailed presidential report is  illustrated by numerous statistical figures that explain and  complement the statements on this message on the state of the  country.  <H5>  Venezuelan Reflections </H5>   The fact that I can address you from the highest office in  the Republic is a situation that cannot repeat itself.  Therefore, I want to take this opportunity to make some final  reflections on the future of Venezuela, the questions involving  Venezuela's future, and the ways to solve problems I have  learned throughout my participation in public life, which I  realized during my short stay at the presidency. These  reflections are aimed at contributing in a modest manner to  examine the decisions that you, as representatives of a country  needing the truth and solution, must make in these dramatic  years.    Our contemporary history has centered on the state. During  70 years of this century and until recently, the center of  disputes in society was the proximity of the state, given its  role as great distributor of income. All social sectors  approached this rich state, capable of enriching profusely, to  enjoy its riches either legitimately or illegitimately. That  state, which was the basis for the habits of the Venezuelan  people, no longer exists. We have a state that is deeply in  debt -- a debt for which oil revenues are not enough -- with  multiple obligations that cannot be met in terms of services and  social security by resorting to old ways and resources.    Petroleum, the source of so many supplies, is today also the  source of our many constraints. Oil revenues are insufficient  for society to live off of them, and in the future it is not  more promising than it has been in the past 10 years.    We built a state that considered erroneously -- as can be  appreciated now -- that the flow of oil revenues was constant,  eternal, and unstoppable. When oil revenues decline and debt  obligations become evident, the state enters a situation of  insolvency, without being able to face its commitments. Today  the state owes workers, contractors, and social institutions  responsible for guaranteeing a minimum level of quality of life  for Venezuelans in terms of health, education, housing, and  transportation.    Venezuelan society has not yet understood this reality.  Representatives of all national sectors continue to come to  Miraflores Palace to demand compliance with real or supposed  commitments. This is the cause for the deterioration of the  governments. The fact of who is leading the country is not as  important. When the hand is extended to the state and it does  not give a prompt and satisfactory response, a sensation that  the state is failing to meet its responsibilities sinks in.    The truth of the matter is that the state can no longer do  things the old way. Never again. It is the duty of Venezuelan  society, now as never before in its recent history, to set forth  its own alternatives and meet its own needs through mechanism of  its own. This does not mean the state will relinquish the role  it must play in a society like ours. However, for this to  happen, society itself must provide the resources that oil  provided in the past.    There is no alternative. We must go -- and we are doing this  now -- from a society that lives off its earnings to a  productive society that can pay taxes and sustain the means that  enable the state to fulfill its social functions. As we never  tire of saying, the majority of Venezuelans do not understand or  agree with this evident truth. The same ones who talk about  state needs that are more reduced and operational and less  interventionist, are the first ones to extend their hands to  obtain the state's protection and resources the minute they face  a problem or difficulty.    In another respect, the reforms package has limited the  state's intervention capacity. Private entities and institutions  were handed activities and powers that not long ago were the  purview of the public sector. This is a signal of progress, but  often, counter to what is being said, the state tries to  intervene in activities that it left to the private sector.  These contradictions are present in Venezuelan society, and they  are the cause of many of the demands made on our depleted state.    The foreign debt burden is real. Between the foreign debt,  the internal debt, the floating debt, and the unregistered debt,  the pressure that exists on the Treasury makes it impossible to  implement many projects and meet many expectations. Fiscal  accounting has turned into a kind of fiscal sleight of hand in  Venezuela. Meanwhile, corrective measures -- many of them  painful -- meet the resistance of deeply rooted traditions as  well as vested interests.    As long as there are no leaders with a clear awareness that  their guidance must enlighten all Venezuelans on the new  conditions, and as long as lawmakers do not accept that they  must sacrifice the promises they made to correct the course, any  effort to obtain fiscal resources will run up against the view  that it will be misspent or provide raw material to corruption.  This predicament is extremely perilous. It is not true that the  leaders are corrupt or insensitive. The truth is, however, that  the leaders do not speak clearly to the people of Venezuela. The  failure to do that turns them into the first victims of the  people's rage, because decisions are made without clarity. When  they become difficult, leaders seek to distance themselves from  them so as not to lose popularity.    That is not the way to build a permanent leadership in a  modern and strife-torn society. Minor victories can only barely  be achieved, and they vanish when despair grows. Public  services were the first casualty of state insolvency. The  deterioration of public services dates back many years, since  fiscal difficulties were first manifested in this field. Many of  our schools and health centers are run-down. Our network of  roads and highways lacks proper maintenance. Our transportation  system is vast but ineffective.    During the bonanza time, adequate maintenance was not  provided because everything could be replaced by new projects or  more money. We were unable to foster an awareness of  maintenance. We lacked the mental clarity which would have  allowed us to regard maintenance as a way to preserve the  country's assets for lean times. Many projects are crumbling  before our eyes .... [pauses] Many projects used to crumble  before our eyes because we expected to replace them with others,  when we should have learned to maintain them instead.    This is a cultural reality of the utmost importance. Social  segments behave that way because they do not maintain what they  have in their own personal lives but seek to replace them with  new and costlier products.    Anyone who throws away a personal possession just because  it has some minor damage cannot have a clear awareness of how to  maintain public goods. People demand that the state eliminate  the fiscal deficit, but often those who propose this desirable  goal are the same ones who do not hesitate, even under the  difficult situation we are experiencing, to pressure the state  to increase its spending to resolve a problem. Those who on  the one hand criticize increases in spending yet reject the  government's actions to obtain more resources are the same  people who on the other hand repeatedly demand the enforcement  of actions that generate further spending. [applause] At the  same time, we are facing just demands for pay increases, better  social security, and programs to protect the most vulnerable  segments of society. These demands lay permanent siege to the  public resources, and the state can no longer face it.  Administrative problems. Compounding all these conditions is  another dramatic one: Public administration is practically  useless. It was an adequate structure for managing a country of  10 million people with a budget that barely exceeded 10 billion  bolivares almost 20 years ago. That same apparatus tried to  manage a nation of 20 million people with a budget of over 1.2  trillion bolivares. That change of scale has turned public  administration into a monster barely able to meet its  obligations. The presidency of the Republic, regarded by the  collective imagination as the center of power and favors, is a  precarious management office upon which an unbending social  pressure is exerted. We have a presidency that uses 19th  century methods, but we need one that meets the needs of the  21st century. The president no longer has the power he once  held. Society has become more complex. There has been progress  in decentralization. New factors of social power have emerged.  Citizens have their own means of administering themselves.  Economic activity is taking a private course. The traditional  government dues are disappearing. The people, however, view  the presidency and the president as the deciding factor in all  the country's benefits and ills. If this view of the  president's actions does not change, it will be difficult for  the head of state to be, beyond brief periods of hope, the  representative who Venezuelans feel is always committed to their  destiny. He will always have to do less than he promised, and  the promises he keeps will always be thought of as limited,  petty, and sometimes as undesirable. Under these  circumstances, the president is a prisoner, but most of all he  is a prisoner of himself if he hopes to carry out the things of  which he dreamed and if he is regarded as a wizard who can  resolve through magic [applause] everything that accounting does  not allow him to do.    We cannot be pessimistic about Venezuela if we intend to do  what must be done, but we must abandon all hope if an erroneous  concept about a leader's role prevents us from courageously  planning and doing what must be done. The only way to defeat  the national belief that only a dictatorship allows the adoption  of severe measures to reorganize the country is to prove that  democracy is capable of doing it. There is no other option.  Democracy cannot be a covert dictatorship, yet democracy cannot  renounce changes that are determined by our times, even when  these changes are difficult and costly.    Lasting leaderships are those that build things even when  it may cost them a short-lived, evasive popularity, not those  that seek to please. Trying to please without assuming the  inherent responsibilities of leadership is the best way to  destroy the people's faith in democracy because in the end  citizens forget demagogic actions and only remember their  personal experience in a disaster. However, the need for a  serious rather than demagogic leadership cannot cast aside,  hide, or deny that the crux of the Venezuelan crisis is the  social issue.    The idea that economic growth in and of itself creates  social  welfare is not true. Economic growth is possible, but a  concentration of wealth can also result in the growth of poverty  within a society. The idea that all the state's efforts should  be directed at maintaining economic variables at a specific  rhythm of growth without meeting the people's basic needs is  suicide for a democratic political regime, and it is also  suicide for the economy and society.    The social problem is much more critical and urgent because  the state's resources have been severely diminished. The social  issue cannot be exclusively handled by the state based on its  fiscal resources. Society as a whole must assume its  responsibility toward less fortunate sectors. That means the  business sector must be aware that its contribution toward  solving the situation of poverty in the country is essential and  unpostponable, because social pauperism renders personal wealth  precarious.    It also means that labor unions and organizations must  understand that a substantial portion of public resources must  be destined for social programs and not so much to fulfill labor  demands. That means, above all, that an organized civilian  society must provide proof of its solidarity by sponsoring  mechanisms that allow us to face more appropriately the  catastrophic conditions created by poverty. To forget the poor  is a form of forgetting democracy and economic progress in a  regime of liberty and democracy. [applause]    A national agreement is essential to solving Venezuela's  problems. This has not been a chance proposal. Instead, it is  based on our conviction that only a broad agreement will allow  us to overcome Venezuelan society's structural problems. Let us  forget the idea that a man or a party will be capable of  carrying out a project of that size or of facing the gigantic  challenges of a modern Venezuela. Only an agreement based on  various opinions around a nucleus of power will be able to  achieve this. This is a mandatory provision, and above all it  necessitates the willingness to recognize the fact that  retaliation or the annihilation of an adversary will only lead  to the collapse of the Republic.    We have faced bitter times in Venezuela. There were elite  leaders who did not feel the country shake under their feet in  1858. Leaders of that time vented their cruelty on one another  and abandoned the idea of an agreement. This ignited the fuse  and civil war broke out. The same thing happened in 1947 and  1948. Each one believed he was right in his own way and the  result was a ferocious 10-year dictatorship.    We have time to learn from those examples, but we do not  have too much time -- the country cannot wait too long. This  year must be the year of a national agreement to guarantee the  survival of democracy and its social achievements. First, an  agreement must signify the acceptance that all groups which make  up our society can and deserve to participate. The groundwork  for an agreement is undermined when someone tries to exclude  someone else. [applause] The pretension of judging who can or  cannot participate leads to a chain of exclusions that  pulverizes any possibility of achieving an agreement.    Second, the agreement must have an unequivocal and sound  democratic basis. We cannot accept the cynical idea expressed  by a German thinker, who said democracy was accepted to achieve  power, but once power was achieved, it was a matter that only  pertained to the group that achieved it and it did not imply a  commitment. That position is political suicide if not voluntary  manslaughter. [applause]    Third, the national agreement cannot be reached through an  endless chain of social demands that would render it futile. No  one can believe all his demands will be part of an agreement  because it would be rendered null if everyone's behavior were  similar. We are dealing with basic issues, and the national  emergency demands that we take these and no others into  consideration.    State reforms must be the core of the agreement. These  reforms have not started...[pauses] these reforms have started  and they have resulted in essential achievements for society,  but pending tasks are so important that they are unpostponable.  The constitutional reforms are a key element of this process.  These do not involve all the changes that may be sought in this  area, only those which manage to create a platform for the  irreversible modernization of the state and the nation.    President-elect Dr. Rafael Caldera has placed special  emphasis on this issue and the State Commission for Reforms can  be an efficient conduit for drafting proposals. Reforms of the  central administration and the presidency of the Republic  represent essential elements for a strategic settlement like the  one that has been proposed. It is necessary to turn the  government structure, above all its center, into an efficient  instrument to fulfill the immense tasks that the Venezuelan  state currently faces.    The presidency of the Republic must be a privileged target  of  this transformation so the head of state can have the  appropriate instruments to formulate, carry out, evaluate, and  control the implementation of the policy adopted by the  government for each specific sector.    Decentralization is another issue that demands a serious  dedication to the tasks resulting from a national agreement.  This process is changing the situation in Venezuela, but  despite all the efforts made since the election of governors and  mayors, it is still misunderstood by many national leaders as  well as by many regional leaders. This is a dangerous  misunderstanding, and its neglect may lead to serious dangers  for the Republic.    Citizen senators, citizen deputies, these are some of the  issues that may become the groundwork for a long-term national  agreement without which Venezuela's future is in danger. The  idea is not to cause alarm, only to tell the country the truth  at this hour, this conflictive hour, this dramatic hour --  because therein lies the solution. [applause]</p>

These actions are necessary to give owners sufficient financial incentive to promptly destroy brucellosis-affected cattle and bison, in order to accelerate the eradication of brucellosis in the United States and protect other cattle and bison from brucellosis. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Interim rule effective October 17, 1994.

To help prevent the spread of brucellosis, the regulations in 9 CFR part 51 (referred to below as the regulations) provide for payment of Federal indemnity to owners of certain animals destroyed because of brucellosis. The payment of indemnity is intended to provide owners with financial incentive to promptly destroy animals infected with or exposed to brucellosis. Because the continued presence of brucellosis in a herd seriously threatens the health of animals in that herd and other herds, the prompt destruction of brucellosis-affected cattle or bison is critical if brucellosis eradication efforts in the United States are to succeed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under &sect;51.3(a)(2)(i) of the regulations, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service may authorize the payment of Federal indemnity by the United States Department of Agriculture to any owner whose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> herd of cattle or bison is destroyed because of brucellosis. Section 51.3(a)(2)(ii) of the regulations sets forth the amount of Federal indemnity that will be paid for such cattle and bison. Under the regulations prior to the effective date of this interim rule, in all of the United States except Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States, the amount of Federal indemnity paid per animal could not exceed $250 for any registered cattle or nonregistered dairy cattle, $150 for any nonregistered cattle other than dairy cattle, and $150 for any bison. In Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States, the amount of Federal indemnity could not exceed $250 for any cattle or bison.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rates for indemnity payments prior to this interim rule have made a number of owners reluctant to destroy their herds, due to the financial loss that could result from selling an animal at slaughter prices, rather than breeding prices. For instance, in 1993, the slaughter value of nonregistered cattle other than dairy cattle averaged approximately $475 per head, whereas the cost of replacing such an animal for breeding averaged close to $770 per head. Therefore, even by combining slaughter value with the $150 Federal indemnity payment, an owner suffered a significant loss per head when depopulating. Owners of dairy cattle experienced even greater losses when depopulating. Combining the average slaughter value of approximately $475 and the Federal indemnity payment of $250 provided an owner with approximately $725 per head, compared to approximately $1,160 in replacement cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reluctance of some owners to depopulate their herds resulted in increased exposure of cattle and bison to infected animals and increased incidence of brucellosis infection. This, in turn, has resulted in increased brucellosis eradication costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

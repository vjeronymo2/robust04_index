			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Mercosur takes to the highways - A look at plans for a Dollars 2.5bn network to further economic integration PLANS for a 'South American Super Highway' linking Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina have been put forward to advance the three countries' commitment to economic integration. The three governments are for the first time calling on the private sector to put up the money and take the risk. It will be the continent's most ambitious highway project in recent years and the first such tripartite co-operation. The proposed 2,500 km expressway to link the commercial centres of Buenos Aires and Sao Paulo will cost an estimated Dollars 2.5bn. Its construction is thought critical to the success of Mercosur, the southern cone common market serving over 200m people which becomes fully operational in 1995. Since the Mercosur treaty was signed in 1990, regional trade has already doubled to Dollars 6.5bn and exporters say an urgent improvement in roads is needed. Plans based on a study commissioned by the InterAmerican Development Bank (IDB) were presented to businessmen, technicians and government representatives last month. The governments of Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay then formed a commission to detail a proposal by next year. Mr Enrique Iglesias, president of the IDB, says that the bank will provide technical assistance and financial guarantees for the project, the cost of which would be recovered mainly through toll revenues. This is a revolutionary concept in countries with often wasteful state spending. . Mr Iglesias, said: 'Construction companies are shocked when we tell them now it's your turn to go to the market and raise finance'. But Mr Alberto Goldman, the Brazilian Transport minister, says there is no other option: 'The state has no more money. Next year for example my budget is only Dollars 500m yet just to recuperate existing roads I would need Dollars 2.5bn." The planned South American Super Highway is the most important of several projects to improve infrastructure within Mercosur to cater for rapidly increasing regional trade. The idea stems from well advanced plans to build a 50 km bridge across the La Plata river linking Colonia in Uruguay to Buenos Aires, reducing the journey between the capitals of Argentina and Uruguay by 280 km. Bids for the Dollars 1bn construction will be invited on a build operate and transfer basis. Based on the construction of the bridge, the IDB initial study by Louis Berger International suggests that the best route for the highway is along the coastline of southern Brazil and Uruguay. Costs would be kept down by using existing roads, improving their condition and widening them from two to four lanes. Estimated costs vary from Dollars 110,000 per km for a two lane road rehabilitation to Dollars 1m for a new four lane bypass. Mr Joseph Revin who co-ordinated the study, suggests investment be recuperated through an open toll system. He estimates the rate of return as 16 per cent in real terms with some sections such as Curitiba - Porto Alegre yielding 37.5 per cent. Viability studies are expected to be finished next year and bidding invited in 1994 for construction to then start in 1995. There are, however, many uncertainties not least the financing. Mr Humberto Busnello, who runs a Brazilian construction company, says he has doubts about the rate of returns, adding 'a lot depends on the bridge - whether that is part government financed'. Members of the Uruguayan delegation admit it could be difficult to get public approval for a heavy traffic highway along the country's coastline. Brazil still needs to pass legislation to allow private concessions of public services. Mr Roberto Requiao, governor of Parana state through which the road will pass, says 'its absurd to give the private sector the liberty to fix tolls. It could become a monopoly where the local economy will not be able to afford to use it.' Despite these fears, interested European and Latin American companies have already formed one consortium with financial support from Banque Nationale de Paris. Mr Olivier de Saint Lager, director of the French company Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez said his company had formed a consortium with CBPO, a subsidiary of Odebrecht, one of Brazil's leading construction companies, Intreglio, an Italian construction company and Cartelloni, a leading Argentinian firm, to prepare a bid for the highway project. He says 'it is not a Pharaonic dream but a viable project. We would not have invested so much in it if we did not think so'.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by "beu": "Short-Term Interest Rates Still Too High </F> for the HWWA; Special Factors Responsible for Strong Money  Supply Growth"]    [Text] In the opinion of the HWWA [Hamburg Institute for  Economic Research], money market interest rates can be lowered  further in coming months.    The HWWA justified its assessment by pointing out that the  expansion of the money supply, quite strong in the first months  of the year, will slow down in coming months, since the special  factors determining growth of the money supply will lose  importance. A number of reasons indicate that the growth rates  of the money supply are statistically overstated, and that the  [present] volume of the money supply will not have an  inflationary impact.    However, it seems hardly possible that the Bundesbank will  achieve its "very ambitious money supply goal, an expansion of  M3 by a maximum of 6 percent in 1994," especially since  liquidity effects from the lowering of the minimum reserve rates  at the beginning of March and the transfer of Bundesbank gains  to the Federal Government, a total of 35 billion German marks  [DM], still have to be absorbed. In the opinion of the HWWA,  exceeding the goal of 7 percent growth, recommended in the  spring report of the research institutes, would be "acceptable  for a certain period, if a perceptible tendency toward lower  rates of the money supply expansion were to develop. This is  because the concept of money supply control is geared to the  medium term."    The HWWA counts among the special factors temporarily  inflating the money supply, among others, that longer-term time  deposits were converted into shorter-term deposits and that  short-term funds were shifted from abroad into the country. The  "window dressing" operations, typical at year's end and  affecting the balance sheet, evidently were larger than usual.  Meanwhile, however, they have perceptibly diminished. Special  tax factors also had an impact, such as the inclusion of  accumulating investment funds in the interest discount tax as of  1 January, 1994, which caused extensive selling within the  country.    The HWWA draws attention to the fact that, because of these  special influences, the effective monetary development is  difficult to assess. But the interest rate development indicates  that monetary policy does not have an overly expansive effect.  Although short-term interest rates have been lowered since  September 1992, the present level is still relatively high  compared to earlier, similar economic phases (3-percent money  market interest rate). Also, the interest structure does not yet  correspond to the picture usual for this economic phase.  Short-term interest rates are not yet noticeably enough below  the long-term rates to offer an adequate incentive for  investments in fixed assets.</p>

			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Three-year offer is rejected MANAGEMENT at Ford New Holland's tractor and parts plant in Basildon, Essex, are to meet union leaders today after a vote among 1,600 manual workers last week to sanction strike action over a three-year pay offer, Michael Smith writes. The company has said that it will not increase its final offer, which includes 4 per cent for the first year and increases linked to the retail prices index in the other years. It will take comfort from the slender strike majority - 824 were for, and 635 against. Ford New Holland, which is 80 per cent owned by Fiat and 20 per cent owned by Ford, said it needed a three-year deal to provide stability in a declining market.</p>

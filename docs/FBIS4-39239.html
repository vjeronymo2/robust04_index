			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksey Portanskiy: "Kremlin Breakthrough in </F> Export Policy Hard To Digest in Ministry Offices"]    [Text] The confused impressions of the revolutionary  nature of the president's recently published economic edicts  package are being replaced with a sober analysis of their  practical points. In the opinion of Foreign Economic Relations  Minister Oleg Davydov, the "revolutionary breakthrough" in his  sphere could cause more headaches than tangible progress today.    Consistency and gradualness in the liberalization of  Russia's  foreign trade was defined in the Russian Federation Government's  March memorandum on economic policy submitted to the IMF. To  wit, as of 1 July it was planned to abolish quotas except for  seven important items: oil, gas, electricity, diesel fuel,  copper, aluminum, and nickel -- for these it was planned to  retain quotas at least until the end of 1994.    This memorandum was approved by the government. The Ministry  of Foreign Economic Relations followed the memorandum, Minister  O. Davydov said. In his opinion we were obviously getting ahead  of ourselves with the edict. Because from its more than terse  text it could be understood that we have already carried out a  virtually 100 percent liberalization of exports. But is that  the case today?    A mechanism of currency control over exports, that is over  the movement and receipt of profits, has not yet been created.  And since that is so, arguments about the leakage of capital  out of Russia will be justified. The Ministry of Foreign  Economic Relations, the Russian Federation State Customs  Committee, and the banks must work out this mechanism by the end  of the year.    The application of quotas and licensing affect the export of  energy carriers to the greatest extent. Quotas for gas can be  repealed painlessly -- we have one monopolist, "Gazprom," in  this field -- and the sale of gas is determined by the  throughput capability of the gas pipeline and by demand. As for  oil, Oleg Davydov believes that for the exporter the main thing  has always been to be on schedule in pumping it through the oil  pipeline. And whereas previously quotas were established in the  government following the proposal of the Ministry of the Economy  and the Ministry of Fuel and Energy, now the same quota  allocation system will merely be moved to a greater extent into  the pumping system.    In general, the state does not have the right to abandon the  tool of licensing, the minister asserts. After all, there are  licenses for military equipment, dual-application technology,  and so forth. So, without giving a detailed explanation of where  they remain and where they do not, one cannot speak of repealing  them. Transforming the authorization system for issuing licenses  into an application system -- that is, easing it -- is another  matter, but here the mechanism must be retained -- that is the  position of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations.    The fact that exports must be expanded if there is no  domestic demand is not doubted. That would be greatly promoted  by a reduction of export duties, which are an anachronism.  According to the above-mentioned memorandum, we undertook to  reduce them by 38 percent in September. According to Davydov,  this will provide a considerable incentive: The advantage to  the producer will increase, many goods will become competitive,  and our budget will grow more effectively from export profits.    Another anachronism of ours is the institution of special  exports, created by the specific nature of our development. But  now, with the repeal of quotas and licenses, special exports  cannot be abolished, at least until the end of the year.  Otherwise, it will be impossible to control export and  correspondingly the receipt of profits from export.    The drafters of the president's edict had the correct  strategic aim -- the liberalization of foreign trade -- but in  this case they clearly leapfrogged natural and previously  designated stages. That is the gist of the foreign economic  relations ministers' comments. Nonetheless, the edict will be  implemented by the usual means of supplementary documents.    Of course, what has been said does not do away with some  questions. The edict was not prepared without the government's  participation, and before it was sent for the president to sign  Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin signed the document. So the very  fact that it has been criticized by a minister is quite out of  the ordinary. Let us also add that in the opinion of some  independent experts the edict's criticism by the Ministry of  Foreign Economic Relations can be explained -- the department is  defending its own interests connected with the possibility of  giving or failing to give permission for the export of raw  materials.</p>

			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 3 HELD IN JERUSALEM ATTACK THAT KILLED 1 PALESTINIAN  </P> <P> Police said today that they are holding three Jewish men in connection with a  submachine-gun attack in which one Palestinian was killed and three others were  wounded.  </P> <P> The announcement came shortly after police fired rubber bullets at stone  throwers, wounding one in the leg, during an hourlong funeral march for the  slain Palestinian.  </P> <P> The three detainees "are suspected of being linked to what happened yesterday"  but are not suspected of the actual shooting, Jerusalem police spokesman Uzi  Sanduri said.  </P> <P> He declined to identify the men beyond saying two were from Jerusalem and one  lived elsewhere in Israel. The suspects were detained Monday night and were  still in custody, Sanduri said.  </P> <P> Mourners decried Israel during the funeral procession through the Temple Mount  compound, some shouting, "We warn the Jews: Mohammed's army will return!"  </P> <P> Police opened fire after one youth smashed a window with his fist and others  broke two windows with rocks.  </P> <P> About 1,000 relatives and friends took part in the funeral march for Khaled  Shawish, the 26-year-old blacksmith killed Monday when an attacker, dressed in  army fatigues and believed to be an Israeli, opened fire with a Uzi submachine  gun.  </P> <P> The gunman, who escaped on foot, also wounded three other Palestinians in the  attack outside the Jaffa Gate entrance to the Old Walled City of Jerusalem.  </P> <P> A caller claiming to represent a Jewish extremist group claimed responsibility  for the shootings.  </P> <P> Earlier today, several dozen masked Palestinian youths gathered at Shawish's  Old City home, waving Palestinian flags and vowing revenge against Jews. Police  watched from nearby rooftops.  </P> <P> One youth, masked with a kaffiyeh and hoisted on the shoulders of another,  shouted: "We should teach the Jews a lesson! Everything Jewish in this town  should be burned! We should prove that this is Palestinian and teach them a  lesson of what a Palestinian state means."  </P> <P> Other youths shouted, "Revolution against the occupier!" and "We want a  Palestinian state!"  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> OCCIDENTAL'S PROFIT DOWN 50%  </P> <P> Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s first-quarter profit was 50% below last year's  level, the company reported today, but the difference was attributed to  one-time gains from a stock sale and a pension fund in the earlier period.  </P> <P> Los Angeles-based Occidental said it earned $67 million, or 24 cents a share,  in the first quarter, down from $113 million, or 52 cents a share, a year  earlier. Sales were $5.14 billion, up from $4.48 billion in the first quarter  of 1988.  </P> <P> Excluding one-time items, first-quarter profit would have been about 50% above  last year's level, said Armand Hammer, Occidental's chairman and chief  executive. Operating profit was $394 million, down from $436 million a year  earlier.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FRENCH COMPANY TO BUY NORTON CO. FOR $1.8 BILLION  </P> <P> Norton Co., which has been fending off a hostile takeover bid from British  conglomerate BTR PLC, said today it agreed to be acquired by the French firm  Compagnie Saint-Gobain in a deal that values the abrasives manufacturer at  around $1.8 billion.  </P> <P> The $90-a-share cash offer exceeds BTR's bid of $1.6 billion, or $75 a share,  which was rejected last month by Norton's board of directors.  </P> <P> Wall Street applauded today's announcement. In active trading on the New York  Stock Exchange, Norton jumped $13.50 to $88.75 a share by midday.  </P> <P> The announced merger with Compagnie Saint-Gobain comes a day after a federal  judge ordered Worcester-based Norton to reveal the amount of a "white knight"  offer it said it had received last week.  </P> <P> The court order came during a hearing on suits filed on behalf of some Norton  shareholders seeking to require Norton to fully and fairly consider BTR's offer  and "take into consideration the interest of the shareholders."  </P> <P> Norton told the Securities and Exchange Commission last Friday that a third  party was interested in buying Norton for more money.  </P> <P> BTR had planned to wage a proxy fight at Norton's annual shareholders' meeting  set for Thursday.  </P> <P> One of Norton's biggest weapons was a new state law that would prevent BTR from  taking immediate control over the Norton board.  </P></p>

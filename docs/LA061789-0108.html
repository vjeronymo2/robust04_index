			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . .: PARIS NO SHY YOUNGSTER  </P> <P> When Mica Paris, 20-year-old British pop-soul singer rolls her eyes in  exasperation, you know what she's thinking: "Here come those dreaded racial  questions."  </P> <P> She doesn't even try to hide her irritation.  </P> <P> "Why do I have to be a black singer?" asks Paris, whose first name is  pronounced MEE-sha. "Why can't I be just a singer?"  </P> <P> Touted as one of the better young singers in the business, Paris sounds quite a  bit like Anita Baker, with a slightly jazz style and a mildly husky tone.  </P> <P> Another mistake.  </P> <P> Don't tell her she sounds like anybody. "They say I sound like Anita Baker or  Aretha (Franklin) or this one or that one," she says. "I don't sound like any  of them. I sound like me."  </P> <P> Though well-known in Britain, Paris is just beginning to establish a reputation  in the United States. Her debut album, "So Good" -- just out on Island Records  -- features a single, "My One Temptation," that is climbing the black charts.  Opening for Ashford and Simpson on their current tour has helped her visibility  in this country.  </P> <P> Raised by her grandparents in London, Paris has been singing nearly all her  life. Because her grandfather was a pastor, she had a strict church upbringing  and started as a youngster singing gospel music -- her strongest influence. In  her teens she became a session singer. Once she started composing and making  demo tapes, all the record companies -- she reports matter-of-factly -- were  eager to sign her.  </P> <P> "Why not?" she asks coolly. "I'm a very good singer. I have my own original  style. I signed with Island because they didn't want to change me or turn me  into a copy of some other singer."  </P> <P> Her goal? It's not at all modest.  </P> <P> "To be the best singer in the business," she replies, without hesitation. "I  know I'm capable of it." DENNIS HUNT  </P></p>

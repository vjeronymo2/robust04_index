			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Court move on 'pirate' TV card ban A leading distributor of 'pirate' satellite television cards is going to the High Court next week to try to win the right to sell the cards in the UK. Mr David Lyons will ask permission to withdraw a voluntary undertaking not to distribute the cards in the UK which he made pending the full hearing of an action launched against him by British Sky Broadcasting. BSkyB said yesterday it would vigorously resist any attempt to withdraw the undertaking. The High Court hearing follows an action in the Irish courts in January when BSkyB - a consortium in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake - was refused a restraining order against Mr Lyons pending a full trial. BSkyB claimed its code had been copied by Mr Lyons, infringing its rights under copyright law. The court rejected the claim because BSkyB had failed to produce sufficient evidence that there had been an infringement of copyright. Mr Lyons is seeking to raise the same issues in the High Court. He said yesterday: 'If I win I will be able to sell cards outside News Datacom (the News Corporation subsidiary that manufactures the smart cards for Sky Television).' BSkyB knocked out all the pirates in May when it distributed new, more sophisticated cards, known as the series nine cards, to more than 3m subscribers. Overnight, viewers with pirate cards were unable to watch subscription channels. Since then, the pirates have been working to beat the new BSkyB smart cards. Mr Lyons said yesterday that he now had a card that would decode all BSkyB channels and planned to start selling them in Ireland next week. Last year the Financial Times wrote to Mr Lyons' company Satellite Decoding Systems and bought a pirate decoder card which worked perfectly. It is claimed that a number of other pirating systems are about to come on the market. One, called Phoenix, can reactivate cancelled cards. Others, say pirates, can upgrade legitimate basic BSkyB cards so that they can receive every channel. The basic package costs Pounds 6.99 a month - the entire package, Pounds 19.99. BSkyB executives privately express scepticism that the new card has been cracked by pirates. BSkyB and News Datacom insist that they will continue to take a wide range of legal and technical measures against the pirates. Distributing or using pirate subscription television cards is illegal in the UK.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Moscow's gold reserves now at 320 tonnes MR YEVGENY Bychkov, head of Russia's Precious Metals and Stones Committee, said yesterday that the country's official gold reserves consisted of 150 tonnes held by the central bank and 170 tonnes with his committee. This figure compares with the rock bottom level revealed about one year and a half ago of 240 tonnes. In an interview with the Financial Times, covering diamonds as well as gold, he also said he would be urging improvements in Russia's relationship with De Beers in talks to be held in Moscow today. Finally, he suggested that Star Technology Systems, an Australian company which has set up a joint stock company with Lenzoloto, a state-owned Siberian gold producer, was unlikely to be allowed to exploit Russia's biggest hard rock gold deposit. The joint stock company, Lena Gold, has been approved by the State Property Committee. It is now waiting for the Russian government to declassify secret information about the Sukhoi Log deposit's reserves so that it can pay the first Dollars 20m instalment of its Dollars 250m investment. Mr Bychkov said, however, that he and the State Geology Committee were preparing a new draft decree which, if approved by the government, would exclude foreign companies from the development of the Sukhoi Log deposit, organise a tender for Russian companies, and commit the government to cover some of the costs. 'We have dozens of other gold deposits which can be exploited by foreign companies. But this one must be exploited by ourselves,' he said. Mr Bycchkov claimed that Lena Gold had not fulfilled conditions set by the government for the Australians to take part in the development of Sukhoi Log. Apart from Mr Bychkov's objections, Star faces claims from the State Geology Committee that Lena Gold has not fulfilled the conditions for a licence to exploit Sukhoi Log to be confirmed by the committee. Nor has Lena Gold sought to do so, arguing that documents have been confirmed by local authorities. Controversy also continues to emerge from Russia's relationship with another foreign company, De Beers. Mr Bychkov said he was intent on bargaining to improve the terms of a five-year contract, signed in 1990 with the Soviet Union and renewed by Russia, whereby 95 per cent of Russian exports of rough diamonds have to go through De Beers. But Mr Sergei Ulin, a director of Almazy Rossii-Sakha, the state-owned company which runs the diamond industry and is in charge of relations with De Beers, said that evaluations had not found the agreement to be 'non-beneficial to our national interests'. He said that Russia could increase prices fetched for its diamonds by improving the efficiency of its diamond polishing industry, adjusting output volumes according to varying international demand, and preventing smuggling.</p>

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (23): Two taxing conditions - Manufacturing industry In the new South Africa, manufacturing industry must fulfil two taxing conditions. Growth must be both export-led and labour-intensive. Marrying these two goals is not going to be easy. South Africa is not a low-cost country - more a high-wage, low productivity one - and its competitive advantage stems primarily from the combination of a rich resource base and highly capital-intensive, value-adding activities. The numbers tell their own story; in 1990, base metals, chemicals and metal products accounted for 58 per cent of manufactured exports, while almost three quarters were classified as 'resource-based'. In part, as trade theory predicts, this reflects South Africa's resource endowment, but two policy elements - forward cover for exports and tax incentives for 'beneficiation' industries, adding value to minerals, also contributed. Since the 1920s, industrial growth has been driven by import substitution behind high tariff and protective walls. In the past decade, however, the emphasis has changed as domestic recession pushed more and more companies into the export market. Despite sanctions, exports of manufactures grew 10 per cent a year between 1984 and 1990 - nearly three times faster than in the 1970s. Indeed, since 1972, exports have grown twice as fast as production - 6 per cent as against 2.6 per cent for output. Five industrial sectors - foods, industrial chemicals, steel, non-ferrous metals and metal products - make up almost two thirds of total manufactured exports but in recent years non-traditional exports - furniture, jewellery, rubber and plastics, and cars - have expanded strongly as business was forced to seek market opportunities abroad. On the face of it, this ought to make cheerful reading for Pretoria's policymakers. Industrial exports that performed so impressively under sanctions should surely do far better now, not just because sanctions have gone, but also because supplyside reforms to enhance productivity and competitiveness are in train. These reforms take two main forms. First, political transition and the thrust of the RDP which, between them, should both improve substantially the industrial relations environment, while boosting productivity, on the strength of increased spending on education and training. The second is the pronounced and continuing shift in trade policy, underlined by tariff reform and the commitment to more export-friendly strategies. South Africa's extremely complex and skewed tariff system is being reformed as part of the country's General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade submission under the Uruguay round. From next January, tariffs will be lowered and rationalised over a five-year period, with longer phase-in periods and higher protection for 'sensitive' industries, most notably clothing and textiles and vehicle assembly. Although South African manufacturing has not been over-protected - according to the World Bank the average tariff is about average for a developing country, although very high by first world standards - the dispersion, complexity and instability of the system have undermined economic efficiency. The net effect has been a heavy bias against exports, two- thirds of which stems from the higher input prices that industry must pay for manufactured inputs. The South African Chamber of Business (Sacob) estimates that manufacturing costs are 15 per cent above the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average, mainly because South African companies pay a quarter more for their inputs than their first-world competitors, but also because both the cost of capital and labour costs, adjusted for productivity, are higher. From next January, this will start to change. The number of tariff rates will be reduced from more than 100 to just six, ranging from 0 per cent to 30 per cent, lowering the average tariff to 15per cent. The frequent discretionary changes in the system that have been the norm, will no longer be possible. The World Bank says that the General Export Incentive Scheme which, until the 1994 budget, provided tax-free financial subsidies to exporters, provided a subsidy of nearly 17 per cent of the value of export. The subsidy, costing some R2bn annually, applies to most exports, increasing with the degree of value added. The Bank warns that manufacturing industry's recent impressive export growth is unlikely to be maintained, when it is phased out, probably by the end of 1997. Crucial to the export drive will be a new system of incentives - by way of exemptions and duty-drawbacks - improved mechanisms for providing pre- and post-shipment export finance, and linking training and research and development assistance to export-oriented companies. The underlying strategy is a reversal of past performance, shifting from a situation in which export sales are a residual after satisfying the home market, to one in which domestic market sales play second fiddle to exports. How tariff reform and export incentives will play out in terms of their impact on manufacturing will only become clear towards the end of the decade. The Industrial Development Corporation, using a macroeconomic model borrowed from the Australians, has calculated that Gatt submission will have a positive impact, albeit only a minor one. Its model, criticised on technical grounds by some private sector economists, estimates that tariff reform will increase gross domestic product by only 0.7 per cent - a one-off impact - while lowering inflation 1 per cent, raising employment 1 per cent, exports 1.2 per cent, and imports 2.5 per cent. The magnitude of these calculations suggests that the impact of Gatt on the South African economy is being oversold. This, however, ignores the qualitative implications in terms of transforming an inward-looking into an outward-oriented manufacturing sector, with significant gains in terms of technology, skills and productivity. Nor do such macro calculations capture the impact of restructuring. Two sensitive industries - cars and clothing and textiles - face a potentially traumatic transitional phase during which some companies will have to close, jobs will be lost and significant government financial support will be needed, for retraining and possibly for redundancy benefits. The motor industry, with seven assemblers, faces far-reaching structural change. The number of models produced will shrink, exports will loom larger as protection phases down over the next seven or eight years to 45 per cent from 110 per cent at present, and - in all probability - two or even three of the existing manufacturers will close or merge with a local competitor. Just what this will mean for employment is unclear at this stage, but there is an influential lobby in business, with some support from the World Bank, for further exchange rate depreciation. This would make exporting more profitable, generating investment and jobs, while giving import substitution industries at least a temporary respite in coming to terms with enhanced competition from abroad. Greater outward orientation of the economy from 1995 might be an engine of growth, according to the World Bank, though not, it warns of (direct) employment generation. A Bank research paper comes down in favour of a three-pronged approach - fostering growth in a small number of selected subsectors, which sounds suspiciously like picking winners, usually frowned upon in Bank orthodoxy; linking support to export performance; and supporting employment generation. Crucial to employment growth is a shift away from the capital-intensive self-sufficiency, counter-sanctions, investments of the 1970s and 1980s, to smaller-scale, export-oriented, job-intensive investment. A potential snag is the ANC's opposition to Asian-style low-wage, sweat-shop industrialisation. The new government is looking for the best of both worlds - labour-intensity but at wage levels above those found in competitive economies. Naively, in a world in which employment growth has been decoupled from output expansion, the World Bank's best scenario for South Africa assumes a return to capital-labour relationships that existed 25 years ago. Only the optimists believe that this will happen. A more likely outcome is greater job creation in manufacturing, especially the small scale sector, though at nothing like the rate necessary to defuse the unemployment crisis.</p>

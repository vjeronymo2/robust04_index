			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TELEVANGELIST MAKES MOVIE;  </P> <P> FILM: PAUL F. CROUCH'S TUSTIN-BASED TRINITY BROADCASTING NETWORK IS PRODUCING A  $6-MILLION FEATURE BASED ON THE LIFE OF CHINESE-AMERICAN EVANGELIST NORA LAM.  </P> <P> Proclaiming that he is "not willing to surrender the motion picture media to  the devil," Orange County televangelist Paul F. Crouch is breaking into the  movie business with a $6-million feature film, aimed at mainstream theater  audiences and financed entirely by donations.  </P> <P> The film, "China Cry," is based on the life of Chinese-American evangelist Nora  Lam and carries the subtitle, "A True Story." Although a new ending was shot  last week at Newhall Ranch, a rough cut is being screened for ministers and  motion picture industry executives. The final version is scheduled to open Nov.  2 in 25 cities.  </P> <P> Packed with recognizable Asian-American and Eurasian actors and shot mostly in  Hong Kong and Macao, the film tells the story of Lam's life in China before and  after the 1949 Communist revolution. A critical episode, both in the book and  film, comes when Lam refuses to denounce Christ and is led before a nighttime  firing squad. As the courtyard is suddenly bathed in an otherworldly light, she  feels the bullets passing near her but is miraculously spared.  </P> <P> As befits the founder and president of the 200-station Trinity Broadcasting  Network, Crouch is marketing the film in a big way -- complete with  razzle-dazzle TV promotions, slick posters and brochures, a book tie-in and an  innovative plan to "pre-sell" millions of tickets.  </P> <P> "China Cry" is presented by TBN Films -- a new, nonprofit California  corporation -- with Crouch listed as executive producer and his son, Matt, as  associate producer. The film was shot in color, features Dolby sound and is  entirely a union production.  </P> <P> It was written and directed by James F. Collier, a Directors Guild member and  veteran of Billy Graham's Worldwide Pictures. Collier wrote or directed several  other "inspirational" films aimed at mainstream audiences, including "Caught,"  "Cry From the Mountain," "Joni" and "The Hiding Place," the story of the late  Corrie Ten Boom and her efforts to save Dutch Jews during World War II.  </P> <P> The director of photography, David Worth, shot Clint Eastwood's "Bronco Billy."  The music and orchestration is by the Oscar-winning team of Al Kasha and Joel  Hirschhorn.  </P> <P> Not since 1988, when Worldwide Pictures was closed by the Graham organization,  has there been such a direct effort by a religious organization to produce a  mainstream feature film with Christian content. (Sun Myung Moon's Unification  Church produced the $45-million "Inchon" in 1982, but that box office bomb,  dealing with Gen. Douglas MacArthur's Korean War landing, made no attempt to  proselytize for Moon or his church.)  </P> <P> Film critic Michael Medved, co-host of PBS's "Sneak Previews," attended a  recent screening and called "China Cry" "a very professional piece of work."  </P> <P> He also said that "the look of the picture is quite authentic," especially the  Shanghai section, adding that the Christian aspects of the film are "relatively  subtle. . . . There are very few moments where it is embarrassing or (where)  the budget shows."  </P> <P> Medved contrasted "China Cry" with some of the Billy Graham films, which while  "fairly well done," were frankly "advertisements for God" that preached mainly  to the converted or those ripe for conversion. Medved said he did find it  curious that Crouch, aiming to control costs and reach a mainstream audience,  chose for his first effort a period story set in another country and culture.  </P> <P> In the rough cut at least, there are also some discreet sexual references (a  love scene between the stars -- both clothed in pajama tops and bottoms --  after their wedding alludes to the fact that Lam was pregnant before her  marriage). In addition, it includes some violence that borders on the  gratuitous (a bloody martial arts sequence involving Lam's Red Army  interrogator serves no discernible plot function).  </P> <P> The Tustin-based Trinity network has more than a dozen TV stations outside the  United States, concentrated in northern Italy, the Caribbean and Central  America.  </P> <P> Backers of "China Cry" are so committed to reaching a worldwide audience that  they took a 12-minute segment of the picture to this year's Cannes Film  Festival. Accompanying the distributor -- Tim Penland of Penland Productions --  was the star, Julia Nickson-Soul (the wife of actor David Soul), who was  featured with Sylvester Stallone in "Rambo II" and appeared in the TV  miniseries "Noble House."  </P> <P> The cast also includes co-star Russell Wong, who appeared in "Eat a Bowl of  Tea" and "Tai-Pan"; France Nuyen ("The World of Suzie Wong" and "South  Pacific"); James Shigeta ("Flower Drum Song" and "Midway"), and Philip Tan  ("Tango and Cash," "Batman" and "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom").  </P> <P> In Trinity's August, 1990, newsletter, Crouch wrote, "I am not willing to  surrender the motion picture media to the devil. . . . If Hollywood had  produced ("China Cry"), you can be sure they would have cut any witness for  Christ out of it. So we had to do it ourselves. And, partners, we have done it!  Praise the Lord!"  </P> <P> With "China Cry," Crouch said, "a whole new door is opening up to this army of  the Lord: theater doors. And into this dark corner of our world we are going to  shine the light of the Gospel! . . . The church let the evil one have the great  motion picture media."  </P> <P> The director's goals are considerably more modest. "I became involved (in  'China Cry') because I thought there ought to be one show that's inspirational  coming out of the industry each year," Collier said after one screening.  </P> <P> This is not Crouch's first involvement with motion pictures. In 1961-65, he  headed the department of TV and film production for the Assemblies of God in  Burbank. In August, 1988, he used Trinity to help mobilize -- on extremely  short notice -- a rally at Universal Studios in Burbank that drew 25,000 people  to protest the release of "The Last Temptation of Christ." Crouch called on Lew  Wasserman, Universal's chairman, to allow the outraged fundamentalists to buy  the film and, in Crouch's words, "burn it at the stake."  </P> <P> Penland, the distributor, resigned his position as Universal's liaison with the  evangelical community to help organize opposition to "The Last Temptation of  Christ."  </P> <P> In a telephone interview last week, Crouch acknowledged that it was the  controversy over "The Last Temptation" that propelled him into film production.  "That's one of things that impelled me to get involved, instead of cursing the  darkness," Crouch said. "I saw a real need in the area of the motion-picture  field. . . . We are not only hoping to reach the present film-going public, but  we're also hoping to appeal to that large segment of the population that has  stopped going to the movies."  </P> <P> The producing experience provided him with an education. As "a complete  neophyte," Crouch said, the countless details and decisions of movie-making  "took much more of my time than I thought it would."  </P> <P> For more than a year, Crouch has been using his nonprofit, tax-exempt network  to build support for "China Cry," talking about it regularly on his prime-time  talk show, "Praise," and reporting on its progress, both in documentary reports  from the set in Hong Kong by Crouch's son, Matt, and in the broadcast  ministry's newsletter. (Neither Crouch took fees for his work on the picture.)  </P> <P> In recent weeks, clips from the film have appeared frequently during Trinity's  24-hour-a-day Christian programming, seen locally on the network's flagship,  KTBN-Channel 40.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most innovative aspect of Trinity's involvement in the film  business has been in financial backing and distribution plans for "China Cry."  Crouch simply asked viewers to give money to make the film, rather than invest.  Any money brought in by "China Cry," Crouch said, would be put into a revolving  fund to make more movies. (One idea, Crouch said, would be a film version of  the biblical Battle of Armageddon, complete with special effects and climaxing  with the Second Coming.)  </P> <P> One person who responded to Crouch's appeal -- to the tune of $40,000 -- was  John F. Long, a Phoenix home developer. Through the charitable foundation that  bears his name, Long donated the money to Crouch.  </P> <P> Long said in a telephone interview that he had seen Lam on Trinity and had read  her book. When Crouch made his appeal to support the movie, Long simply picked  up the phone and did so.  </P> <P> "I think the type of movies that are being produced that young people are  seeing, all the crime and violence, has an adverse affect," he said. "The  reason I made the donation is that I believe I'm making an investment in the  future of our young people. . . . It's important for the younger generation . .  . to understand that miracles do happen in modern times."  </P> <P> Crouch has asked supporters, on the air and in the network's monthly  newsletter, to fill in reservation coupons -- a "faith promise" -- committing  them to buy blocks of tickets to the movie when it plays in their area. The  aim, he wrote, is "to secure the partnership of a major distributor so that the  film will be seen by the world, and not just by Christians."  </P> <P> Under the plan, called "Advance Purchase Discount Tickets," in exchange for  reserving blocks of 25 to 1,000 tickets, individuals receive a 20% discount.  Groups, Crouch wrote, "may use this as an opportunity to gain a profit for  their own ministries." (Despite this support for "China Cry," Crouch cautioned  that support for the film "must come from your entertainment budget and not  from your regular TBN gifts of support.")  </P> <P> Tickets for the 1981 Academy Award-winning "Chariots of Fire" and "The Mission"  were sold in a similar fashion by various religious organizations.  </P> <P> According to Tim Penland, the distributor, more than 75,000 of these  reservations have been received in the Orange County-Los Angeles area alone.  More than 40 Southern California theaters have agreed to book the film in  November, Penland said. As part of the marketing plan, the other 24 cities  chosen for the film's platform opening -- including Denver, Miami and Dallas --  were selected to coincide with the location of Trinity's owned-and-operated TV  stations.  </P> <P> Ticket reservations so far total more than $5 million, Penland said. More than  1 million requests have been received alone from the cities where "China Cry"  is opening, Penland said, and he expects more than 2 million by the opening. In  exchange for a payment of 80% of the local admission price, which varies from  city to city, Penland will soon be sending out the tickets.  </P> <P> Keyed to the film's release, the religious publishing house Thomas Nelson will  be issuing a "movie edition" of Lam's autobiography. "China Cry" has already  sold more than 100,000 copies in a previous edition. The new edition, featuring  a still from the movie on the cover and a new co-author, will be sold through  both the Trinity and Lam ministries, as well as in bookstores, and may have a  first printing of 200,000 copies, a Nelson spokesman said.  </P> <P> It is difficult to separate Crouch and Trinity Broadcasting Network from Nora  Lam, her own ministry and "China Cry." Since 1982, the San Jose-based Lam has  been listed as one of Trinity's "Foreign Missions" in the network's literature,  and Lam appears regularly on Crouch's prime-time talk show, "Praise," and makes  heartfelt appeals in Trinity's twice-yearly "Praise-athon" fund-raisers.  Trinity produces Lam's Chinese-language religious programming, which is  broadcast in Taiwan. Lam has been boosting both the film and the book in her  own quarterly newsletter, China Today.  </P> <P> Lam and Trinity have produced a non-religious TV magazine show seen on Chinese  state TV, and Crouch has said several times that the Chinese government has  agreed to broadcast "China Cry" as a four-part miniseries. However, that seems  problematic in light of a recently reported ideological crackdown on the  Chinese film industry. At a San Joaquin Valley revival several years ago,  Crouch predicted that "the Bamboo Curtain is coming down!"  </P> <P> In the world of Christian broadcasting, Lam is not without her critics -- none  of whom will speak on the record. They have criticized her early relationship  with the evangelist Kathryn Kuhlman, her fund-raising techniques, her tours to  China. Some have accused her of embellishing  </P> <P> details of her life story in "China Cry." Several years ago, Lam's organization  was refused membership in the National Assn. of Evangelicals. Officials of the  50,000-member organization based in Wheaton, Ill., would not reveal the  grounds.  </P> <P> Crouch has had his own share of scrapes with controversy. He and his wife, Jan,  began their broadcast ministry 17 years ago in partnership with Jim and Tammy  Bakker, an arrangement that ended acrimoniously with the Crouches in control of  the Orange County-based network and the Bakkers heading to North Carolina. In a  recent book by Austin Miles, "Don't Call Me Brother," Bakker is quoted as  claiming that the station "was literally stolen out from under us. . . . Nobody  will ever take a television ministry away from us again."  </P> <P> In 1989, Crouch and Trinity left the National Religious Broadcasters following  a yearlong investigation by the voluntary organization's ethics committee,  which looked into complaints by former employees, partners, colleagues and  suppliers. Crouch and Trinity have been involved in civil suits and charges  before various governmental boards in at least half a dozen states. Crouch  reported an annual salary of $125,000 in 1988 and drives a $70,000 BMW supplied  by the network. Crouch's wife, son and various in-laws are on Trinity's  payroll, and another son recently received a large loan from the network to buy  several TV stations.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Commenting on the awaited summit between President  Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton, AL-BA'TH says:  Arab and foreign political quarters and news media have  continued to talk about the awaited summit between Presidents  al-Asad and Clinton. These quarters have stressed the importance  of this summit for the peace process, noting what it could offer  to achieve a just, comprehensive peace in the region if the U.S.  Administration shows understanding of the facts of the conflict  in the region. As these quarters believe, it is no longer  acceptable for the U.S. position to remain within a theoretical  framework. This is especially so, since the U.S. Administration  is the party that launched the peace process on the basis of UN  resolutions and the principle of land for peace.    More than two years have passed since the peace process was  launched. Israel, however, has continued to play the same role,  namely, refusing to comply with international resolutions and  the foundations of the peace process. This resulted in wasting  an opportunity deemed by observers as historic when the Madrid  conference convened and then resumed in Washington.    AL-BA'TH adds: Unlike the Arab parties, Israel went to the  Madrid conference and the Washington talks not to commit itself  to the foundations of the Madrid conference but to exploit the  peace talks to achieve its aims which it has sought for a long  time through various means. Therefore, the peace talks have not  made progress because of this Israeli attitude.    The paper thinks that the recent U.S. move came after the  U.S. Administration felt that the entire peace process was in  danger, especially since it is now convinced -- this is apparent  through official statements -- that partial, separate solutions  would never achieve genuine peace.    Consequently, AL-BA'TH adds, the U.S. Administration insists  always that comprehensive settlement in the region would bring  peace, security, and stability to the region and that any peace  without Syria and Lebanon is not considered peace. The summit  between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton this month comes against  this background. It is presumed, as Arab and foreign quarters  point out, that this summit will focus on the need to salvage  the peace process which is threatened by Israel's position.  These quarters assert, moreover, that it all depends on the  U.S. Administration's position, especially since Syria has a  very clear position on the peace process and is very much  concerned about achieving a just and comprehensive settlement.</p>

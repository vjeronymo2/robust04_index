			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy by </F> Georgiy Chernomorskiy; place and date not given: "I Will Not  Accept Reproach Regarding Ashgabat"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Chernomorskiy] There have  been reports in the press regarding your speech at the session  of the CIS Defense Ministers' Council in Ashgabat, blaming you  for making statements contradicting our official state policy.  Is that correct?    [Radetskyy] I believe that some lies have been added to the  truth. Tell me, what was wrong with Ukraine's desire to share  its experience of forming national armed forces with other  states, given the fact that our Republic was the first to set  out upon that path? Or what harm could be done by my statement  regarding building our relations on a bilateral basis? This  would be the most acceptable solution for us. Besides, I do not  rule out the possibility of resolving several problems within  the CIS framework. Some politicians have attempted to reproach  me. Thus, I would ask you to publish the text of my Ashgabat  speech in your newspaper. [passage omitted]    [Chernomorskiy] Television reports have repeatedly  emphasized that a number of important issues were resolved in  the course of your meeting with Russian Defense Minister  Grachev, and that there was no confrontation between you two.  What did you discuss?    [Radetskyy] I used to study with Pavel Grachev at the  General Staff Academy, where he was in his senior year. When I  met him in Ashgabat I was afraid that the "elder brother  syndrome" might have an impact on our relations. However,  Grachev was very polite, both to me and my motherland. That  determined the atmosphere of the negotiations. We discussed  military-technical issues. If Russia does not receive Ukrainian  subassemblies it will not be able to produce certain arms. At  the same time, Ukrainian defense industries will face work  stoppages without Russian parts. We also reached an agreement  on another important issue. The point is that a number of  Ukrainian military educational institutions offer training not  available in Russia. At the same time, there is no need for us  to open new departments or institutes provided we can train our  specialists in the neighboring state. An agreement was also  reached regarding a balanced approach to nuclear issues and the  dispute over the Black Sea Fleet.    [Chernomorskiy] Our newspaper has been receiving a lot of  letters from mothers of soldiers drafted in spring 1992. Were  it not for the Supreme Council decree prolonging their term of  service, those soldiers would have returned home by now.    [Radetskyy] I will be happy to reassure mothers with your  newspaper's assistance. I want to point out that this is a  temporary measure. On the one hand, we are reducing our Armed  Forces now and that will alleviate the demand for manpower.  Secondly, I believe that our lawmakers will review the  categories of draftees excused from active service. I also hope  that the number of young people dodging the draft will  substantially decrease. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several State and local chapters of the National Federation of the Blind, other organizations, and many individuals took the position that no adaptations are necessary for dwellings inhabited by persons who are blind. These individuals and organizations maintain that issues such as color contrast and controls with tactile markings are largely a matter of individual preference and need, and that guidelines in these areas could very easily interfere with some individuals' needs and accustomed ways of functioning. These groups and individuals feel that establishing guidelines for dwelling units would only serve to separate blind persons from the rest of society. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For each type of residential housing requirement suggested by commenters, varied and numerous means by which to achieve the requirement were proposed. For example, commenters suggested various methods of providing color contrast. Individual preferences and accommodations vary widely and it would therefore be difficult to accommodate all people with vision impairments using one color. Similarly, on the issue of controls with tactile markings, commenters indicated a variety of individual preferences for controls with tactile markings. Based on commenters' responses, no single tactile marking can reasonably accommodate all individuals with vision impairments. The same rationale is applied to types of lighting fixtures where commenters' responses varied widely and no one type of fixture is viewed as accommodating a significant number of persons with vision impairments. A type of lighting that may be helpful for some persons, may be harmful to others. Individuals with vision impairments may have had different training or have different needs, so that any one requirement may exclude as many people as it may serve. For these reasons, the guidelines do not include provisions for this section. Requirements for elevators, stairs, signage and protruding objects are already addressed in ADAAG 4.1.3 and are applicable to residential housing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 14. Public Rights-of-Way <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ADAAG 14 adapts provisions for buildings and facilities to new construction and alterations of pedestrian and related facilities in the public right-of-way. This section covers work that involves elements of pedestrian access, circulation, or use and that is undertaken in the public right-of-way whether by intention or as a consequence of other work. A right-of-way is a legal right of passage and is distinguished from a site by its linear nature and connective function.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Provisions of this section apply to public sidewalks, including those on overpasses and bridges and in underpasses and tunnels, and fixed street furnishings, such as benches, drinking fountains, telephones, toilet facilities, bus shelters, and signage, that are located on or along public sidewalks and to public sidewalk curb ramps and street crossings that complete the pedestrian circulation network. ADAAG 14 also contains provisions for on-street parking spaces, parking meters and crossing controls, passenger loading zones on public streets, and callboxes along roadways.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Modifications and specific requirements respond to the unique nature and function of public rights-of-way. For example, natural terrain, constrained width, the number and complexity of services that must be accommodated within and along the public right-of-way, and the demands of adjacent development offer little opportunity for the establishment of accessible routes along public sidewalks. Thus, ADAAG 14 substitutes the concept of a continuous passage to connect public sidewalks, public sidewalk curb ramps, and street crossings into a pedestrian network that serves both adjacent sites and elements intended for pedestrian use on and along the public sidewalk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NPRM addressed the overall framework for a pedestrian circulation network, as well as the elements and components of such a network. Almost 300 commenters responded to the proposed requirements and questions with several thousand recommendations regarding public rights-of-way. One third of these commenters represented State and local governments. Over half of the State and local government comments were submitted by transportation, streets and highways, and public works agencies. Other commenters included: State code administrators, the National Conference of States on Building Codes and Standards, 10 Federal agencies, 70 individuals with disabilities, State and local organizations representing people with disabilities, and national organizations such as the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund (DREDF). Detailed comments were also received from the Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA) and the Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association (EPVA), as well as from national organizations representing individuals who are blind or have vision impairments and organizations expressing the views of individuals who are deaf or have hearing impairments. Additionally, comments were received from architects, civil and transportation engineers, national trade and professional groups, and manufacturers of products and materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The NPRM proposed a specific set of requirements that would apply to both new construction and alterations where feasible and proposed a series of exceptions for a variety of conditions of site infeasibility. Commenters suggested that such an approach might encourage departures from the guidelines with claims of site infeasibility that might not be warranted and might make enforcement more difficult. Furthermore, opportunities to maximize the usability of newly constructed pedestrian environments might be overlooked because of the availability of lesser options.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The interim final rule has been reorganized and clarified to emphasize that public entities undertaking new work must provide a high degree of accessibility in public rights-of-way. When making alterations to existing work that involves pedestrian elements, entities must provide the maximum feasible degree of compliance with provisions for new construction. This reorganization more clearly distinguishes between new construction and alterations and provides a strong uniform set of accessibility requirements with few exceptions for new construction. For example, the design of a new subdivision, new town, or an expansion of jurisdictional limits to incorporate as yet undeveloped land must be fully accessible according to provisions of this section for new construction. A consistent approach to public sidewalk, public sidewalk curb ramp, and intersection design is described for implementation when such new work is undertaken.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

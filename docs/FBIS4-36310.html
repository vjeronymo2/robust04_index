			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Adnan Husayn: "Barzani and Talabani Agree To </F> Halt Armed Conflict"]    [Excerpts] London -- The Iraqi Kurdish leaders Mas'ud  Barzani and Jalal Talabani have agreed to end the fighting that  continued between their militias during the past month and to  eliminate the effects of the most extensive armed clashes Iraqi  Kurdish areas have witnessed since they were placed under UN  protection in the spring of 1991.    Barzani and Talabani held a meeting the day before yesterday  in Irbil, capital of the Kurdish region. It is the first  meeting since the armed confrontations broke out early in May.  [passage omitted] The two Kurdish leaders' agreement includes  three clauses:    -- A total cease-fire in all areas, including the areas  adjacent to the border with Iran in al-Sulaymaniyah Governorate  (where Patriotic Union of Kurdistan militias clashed with groups  of Kurdish Islamists)    -- To form an operations room for the border areas, to  consolidate the cease-fire there. This room should include  representatives from Barzani's party, Talabani's party, the  Unified Iraqi National Congress, the Kurdistan Front, and the  Islamic Movement of Kurdistan.    -- To hold similar meetings later to solve outstanding  problems, fully normalize conditions, and eliminate the effects  of last month's events in various spheres.    Independent Kurdish sources believe that Barzani's and  Talabani's meeting "was necessary to halt the Kurdish fighting."  However, they warned of the eruption of "further clashes" in the  future "if the two parties do not backtrack on their  monopolization of power" in Iraqi Kurdistan "and reorganize  conditions to form a (local) parliament and a government in  which all parties are represented."</p>

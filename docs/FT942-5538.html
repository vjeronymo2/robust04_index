			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Venezeula Equities in Caracas recorded their fifth consecutive rise as foreign investors, particularly from the US, were seen buying heavily. The market has been attracting overseas interest following the decision earlier this week to replace a capital gains tax of up to 37 per cent with a 1 per cent share transaction levy. The Merinvest index climbed 11.49, or 8.2 per cent, to 150.80 in turnover that was reported to be above Dollars 6m, compared with a recent average of some Dollars 3m. Caracas is one of the smallest of the Latin American markets, with a total capitalisation of some Dollars 6bn, and, in dollar terms, has underperformed the region in the IFC emerging markets index.</p>

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Barcom in the black with Pounds 0.7m BARCOM, the civil engineering and plant hire concern, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 757,000 on turnover of Pounds 13m in the six months to end-March. That compared with a deficit of Pounds 76,000 on sales of Pounds 1.44m - restated to conform with FRS 3. Mr John Pinckard, chairman, said the acquisition of the Hawkins plant hire business in February had been satisfactorily completed. It had now been integrated into the group and was already contributing to profits, he added. The acquisition had increased group borrowings substantially. At the period end they had risen by Pounds 18m resulting in gearing of 164 per cent, Mr Pinckard said. The interest charge increased from Pounds 193,000 to Pounds 420,000. An interim dividend of 1.25p (nil) is declared, payable from earnings per share of 4.05p (0.3p losses).</p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAGUNA HILLS BEATS ESTANCIA, WINS LEAGUE  </P> <P> After beating up on its Pacific Coast League football rivals all season, Laguna  Hills High School had no trouble thrashing hapless Estancia, 38-0, Friday night  at Newport Harbor High.  </P> <P> The Hawks (8-1-1, 5-0) became league champions and qualified for a spot in the  Southern Section Division VII playoffs.  </P> <P> The Eagles (2-8, 1-4) were the league champs in 1989.  </P> <P> The first quarter set the tone as Laguna Hills' opening drive lasted more than  three minutes and resulted in quarterback Casey Sullivan's run 21 yards into  the end zone. Running back Marwan Saba (14 carries for 102 yards) ran seven  times for 62 yards on that drive. Marc Brodbeck kicked the first of three extra  points.  </P> <P> After Estancia could not get any offense going on its first possession, Laguna  Hills' Dan Ciska blocked the kick and charged 20 yards into the end zone.  </P> <P> In the second quarter, good field position allowed the Hawks' Brodbeck to kick  a 40-yard field goal, followed by a drive downfield on the next possession  which resulted in a touchdown pass from Sullivan (six of 11 for 103 yards) to  Sergio Jimenez with 1:30 left in the half. The Eagles successfully made two  goal-line stands in the second half, but tough defensive play by Ciska didn't  allow the Estancia offense room for improvement on the first half's dismal  performance. MARGIE LUCK  </P></p>

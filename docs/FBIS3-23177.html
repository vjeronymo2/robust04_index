There are still "incongruities" concerning his  relationship with the Rhineland-Palatinate Office for the  Protection of the Constitution, participants revealed after a  meeting of the committee in Bonn on Wednesday [2 March].    Thus, it is unclear what Steinmetz did for the authority and  why the Land Office for the Protection of the Constitution did  not tell the Federal Government earlier about the liaison man,  who was allegedly infiltrated in the RAF command echelon, it was  said. It was stressed that the suspension of the criminal  proceedings against Steinmetz, which was ordered by the chief  federal prosecutor's office, is only a temporary measure.  Further insights might be gained from the criminal proceedings  against Birgit Hogefeld, who was arrested in Bad Kleinen.</p>

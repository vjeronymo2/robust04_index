			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTH AFRICA REGIME SLATES ANC MEETING;  </P> <P> APARTHEID: WHITE MINORITY GOVERNMENT TO HAVE FIRST OFFICIAL MEETING WITH  LONG-OUTLAWED BLACK GROUP IN BREAKTHROUGH.  </P> <P> South Africa's white minority government, announcing a major political  breakthrough, said today that it will hold its first official meeting with the  long-outlawed African National Congress on April 11.  </P> <P> President Frederik W. de Klerk said he will meet ANC leaders including Nelson  R. Mandela, the movement's newly appointed deputy president, whom he freed last  month after 27 years in prison for plotting to overthrow white rule.  </P> <P> The meeting is a first step toward negotiations on a new constitution to  enfranchise South Africa's black majority.  </P> <P> "The state president, assisted by members of the Cabinet, will discuss with Mr.  Mandela and the ANC leaders from outside and from within the country the  obstacles perceived to obstruct the process toward negotiations," De Klerk said  in a statement.  </P> <P> Mandela is due back in South Africa on Saturday after a tour of African and  European countries that reunited him with ANC leaders exiled since the  guerrilla movement was banned in 1960.  </P> <P> De Klerk lifted the ban in February in one of a series of sweeping reforms of  four decades of apartheid race segregation.  </P> <P> Speaking in Stockholm, where he was visiting ailing ANC President Oliver Tambo,  Mandela said the meeting with the South African government will have to be more  than a formality if negotiations are to go ahead.  </P> <P> "Our strategy is going to be that the very first meeting between the ANC and  the government must produce a result if we are going to continue talking," he  said in a radio interview.  </P> <P> Fears for the future of negotiations have been fueled by a wave of unrest which  has swept black townships and tribal homelands in the past month and cost more  than 200 lives.  </P> <P> Some of the worst violence has been in the 10 self-governing homelands created  under apartheid, where millions of blacks forced by Pretoria to give up South  African citizenship fear that they will miss out on De Klerk's promised  reforms.  </P> <P> Government officials say they cannot lift a 3-year-old state of emergency until  the unrest subsides. An end to the state of emergency is one of the ANC's key  conditions to negotiations.  </P> <P> Mandela and other anti-apartheid leaders have repeatedly called for an end to  the violence, and the need for black unity before negotiations began was a  major theme of Mandela's speeches at rallies in all four provinces after his  release.  </P> <P> The ANC leader reiterated his movement's conditions today but said he is  optimistic about negotiations.  </P> <P> "I think Mr. De Klerk does want change, and there are men advising him who I  think do want change," he said.  </P></p>

Each proposal must include documentation of institutional support for the proposed program in the form of signed letters of endorsement from the president, chancellor, or director of the U.S. and foreign institution(s) involved. The documentation may also be submitted in the form of a signed agreement by the same persons. Each agreement or letter of endorsement must describe the institution's commitment to an on-going partnership and make specific reference to the proposed program and how it will fit into and be supported by the institution's current activities in internationalizing its educational programs. Proposals must discuss on how the partnership will be continued beyond the period of the grant award. If not submitted with original proposal, documentation of support from foreign institutions must be received by 5 p.m. Washington, D.C. time on October 24, 1994, addressed to Robin Kline or Mary Ann Garlic, E/ASU, Room 349, U.S. Information Agency, 301 4th Street SW., Washington, DC 20547.

Institutions must submit a comprehensive line item budget, including a budget summary page, based on the specific guidance in the Application Package. USIA will not pay for indirect costs under this program; however, indirect costs may be included as part of an institution's cost sharing. Requesting USIA support for indirect costs will result in technical ineligibility. Proposals must demonstrate substantial cost-sharing (dollar and in-kind) in both program and administrative categories, including overseas partner contributions. Cost-sharing may be in the form of allowable direct or indirect costs. The recipient must maintain written records to support all allowable costs which are claimed as being its contribution to cost participation, as well as cost to be paid by the Federal government. Such records are subject to audit. The basis for determining the value of cash and in-kind contributions must be in accordance with OMB Circular A110, Attachment E. Cost-sharing and matching should be described in the proposal. In the event the recipient does not provide the minimum amount of cost sharing as stipulated in the recipient's budget, the USIA contribution will be reduced in proportion to the recipient's contribution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The recipient's proposal shall include the cost of an audit that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

Includes review by the recipient's independent auditor of a recipient-prepared supplemental schedule of indirect cost rate computation, if such a rate is being proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The audit costs shall be identified separately for: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Preparation of basic financial statements and other accounting services; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Preparation of the supplemental reports and schedules required by OMB Circular A&hyph;133, AICPA SOP 92&hyph;9, and the review of the supplemental schedule of indirect cost rate computation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USIA reserves the right to reduce, increase or otherwise modify proposal budgets in accordance with the needs of the program. For organizations with less than four years of experience in international exchange activities, grants will be limited to a maximum of $60,000. Administrative costs cannot exceed 20 percent of the requested budget, including administrative expenses for orientation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Allowable costs for the program include the following (see Application Package for further details): <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A.

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: ISMA considers shortening bond settlement time PLANS to shorten substantially the standard settlement period for Eurobonds are being put forward by the market practices committee of the International Securities Market Association. Traders at ISMA's annual meeting in Copenhagen will be asked to consider shortening the seven-day settlement period to two or three days. Mr John Dowsett, deputy chairman of the committee, said this would bring the Eurobond market into line with other markets. Mr Dowsett and the committee favour two-day settlement, which is the standard in the foreign exchange market and most domestic bond markets. Shorter settlement periods are favoured by regulators because they reduce the amount of systemic risk, by cutting the period of exposure between trade and settlement dates. But the market has been slow to respond: four years ago the Group of Thirty set a target of three-day settlement by the end of 1992 If the Mr Dowsett's proposal finds favour with ISMA members, the next step will be to set up a working party consisting of regulators, fund managers, global custodians, the two Eurobond clearing houses, Euroclear and Cedel, and ISMA representatives. Mr Dowsett hopes a new standard could be introduced on January 1 1995. The move to two or three-day settlement would bring tangible benefits to trading firms. First, by reducing exposure, it would reduce the amount of capital tied up by trading, freeing up capital for other areas of business, such as the derivatives markets. From the trader's point of view, quicker settlement would also reduce counterparty credit risk. Under the current system, counterparty credit limits are constantly under pressure, with traders often exceeding the internal limits placed on their exposure to any single counterparty. On a technical level, switching between markets would be easier if they had similar settlement periods. Objections to the proposals could come from firms servicing retail investors. Regional representatives of ISMA have already canvassed members. 'There was some negative feedback from Belgium,' said Mr Dowsett but the volume of retail business is small and could continue to use seven-day settlement. In other words, there would be a two-tier market with most trades settling in two or three days.</p>

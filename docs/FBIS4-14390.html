			<p>BFN     [Text] This morning the head of government, Prime Minister  Mokdad Sifi, met with the representatives of four pilot  municipalities in his office. The representatives were chosen  from the Governorates of Algiers, Batna, Sidi Bel Abbes, and  Illizi.    The meeting was the first of its kind. It was attended by  the minister of interior and localities as well as by a number  of governors. The meeting is an opportunity to come closer to  the real problems facing municipalities.    Also, this meeting would be an opportunity to put the last  touches on his government's program, due to be announced in the  next few days, by drawing on the citizen's concerns and problems  in deprived municipalities.    According to information reaching us from the government  palace, the government was going to allow the citizens to  participate tangibly in the management of the local affairs  through the newly formed 10,000 district committees, which have  been set up throughout the country over the past few months.</p>

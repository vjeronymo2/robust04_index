			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Albert Fisher declines to Pounds 52.1m A FALL in pre-tax profits from Pounds 89m to Pounds 52.1m completed what was described as a 'traumatic year' for Albert Fisher, the UK-based food processing and distribution group. Mr Stephen Walls, who recently became chairman, said a review of the group had discovered no 'black hole' in the balance sheet. However, trading suffered from depressed economic conditions and a glut of fresh produce in the second half. Mr Walls took over in July from Mr Tony Millar, who built the group by acquisition into a stock market star of the 1980s. Mr Millar stepped down after a profits warning caused the shares to fall to 41p, compared with the previous year's peak of 133p. Yesterday the shares closed  1/2 p lower at 41 1/2 p. Mr Walls said shareholders had been given a rough ride and he was taking an unsentimental look at the whole group. The priority was to focus on organic growth, rather than acquisitions, although further infill purchases were not ruled out. Group turnover grew marginally from Pounds 1.1bn to Pounds 1.18bn in the year to August 31. Pre-tax profits were cut by an exceptional charge of Pounds 10.01m - compared with a credit of Pounds 2m last time - comprising Pounds 6m of restructuring costs in Europe and the US, and a Pounds 2.5m writedown of assets. The remaining Pounds 1.5m of redundancy costs includes Mr Millar's pay-off, to be detailed in the annual report. An extraordinary debit of Pounds 10.27m covered losses from the disposal of Holco, a Dutch mushroom and asparagus bottling plant, and other mushroom-related activities. Mr Walls said that, having cleaned out the balance sheet, he did not anticipate further exceptional or extraordinary charges in the current year. The group's net cash at the year-end fell from Pounds 70m to Pounds 30m. Earnings per share fell from 10.02p to 5.6p. The final dividend of 1.9p (up from 2p) maintained the total at 3.75p, even though dividend cover fell to 1.5 times. This was said to reflect the board's confidence about the future and the group's strong cash position. Mr Walls said: 'The actions currently under way should generate better performance than the levels seen in the second half of 1992.' Lex, Page 22; Details, Page 25</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Oslo, May 4 (AFP) -- The European Parliament's  decision to approve Norway's European Union (EU) membership  agreement demonstrates that Norway is welcome in the EU,  Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland said Wednesday [4  May].    "The decision also shows that the parliamentarians support  the negotiation results, which ensure special Norwegian needs  such as Norwegian agriculture, an active regional policy and new  possibilities for support for fisheries," she said.    The European Parliament accepted Norway's agreement  Wednesday  with 374 votes out of 456.    Meanwhile, Norwegian Trade Minister Grete Knudsen, who was  responsible for negotiating the EU agreement in Brussels, said  Wednesday that a date for the Norwegian referendum would be  decided upon by May 27.    Swedes will vote November 13, Austria June 12, while Finland  has yet to set a date.</p>

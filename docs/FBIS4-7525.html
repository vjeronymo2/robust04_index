			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Slavica Lukic: "Mirko Madjor Is Lying"] </F>   [Excerpts] "The key role in the attempt to destabilize the  Croatian Peasants' Party [HSS] was played by government circles  outside our party. We have proof that the Information Office of  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its chief, Ante Babic,  participated in it. Kilograms of material intended to undermine  confidence in the present HSS leadership were sent from the fax  machine in Mr. Babic's office and in envelopes belonging to the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Some material was sent from fax  machines in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and we have other  proof of the involvement of government bodies about which we do  not wish to speak." This is what the head of the HSS, Drago  Stipac, said after 16 days of silence regarding the events in  the HSS, the Kasinski [Kasina, a town near Zagreb] meeting, and  the open letter of Mirko Madjor. HSS Political Secretary Mirko  Glokovic and vice president of the party's Presidency Stjepan  Radic also spoke at a news conference held on Monday at HSS  headquarters.    Drago Stipac admits that, due to a rapid increase in HSS  membership, organizational, personnel, and financial problems  occurred, but he claims that they are not nearly as drastic as  Madjor and Stojanovic are trying to portray them. Stipac  believes that the claims that Madjor and Stojanovic have  presented in the open letter and in the media are lies and  half-truths. The HSS, he states, is not some kind of a peasant  trade union. Only 27 percent of its members are peasants; the  rest have other occupations. Certain communications problems  with the field branches also exist, but they are gradually being  resolved. [passage omitted]    Stipac informed the journalists that a closed meeting of the  HSS Executive Council was held on 12 March at which the  documents of the Kasinski meeting were discussed in detail. It  was established that 51 HSS members were present in Kasina and  that some of them had been misled and falsely informed about the  content of the documents they had signed. The HSS Executive  Council assessed that the Kasinski meeting was convoked in an  illegal manner and that the claims in the Kasinski documents are  not true. Mirko Madjor and Dr. Stojanovic were removed from all  their party functions with 90 votes for and only four against.  Thus, the decision on their suspension made earlier by the HSS  Presidency was confirmed. The HSS leaders repeated several times  that there is no rift in the HSS and that the rebellion of  Madjor and Stojanovic stems from their dissatisfaction with  their own positions in the HSS. It was heard at the conference  that "Madjor became dissatisfied from the moment when he was not  elected president of the HSS." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Arts: A compelling Prize - Screen IT IS one thing to write a best-selling book called The Prize: The Epic Quest For Oil, Money and Power detailing the personalities, history and geopolitics of the world's largest industry, as Daniel Yergin did last year (it won a Pulitzer prize) and quite another to turn such a book into eight hours of gripping television documentary. The power of a book lies in its words, and the supply of words is free and limitless. Television has to have pictures and those pictures can prove hard to find when the story begins as long ago as the 1850s and extends into such crevices of history as the Japanese scheme to produce aviation fuel from pine roots, or Marcus Samuel's ability to run 14 oil tankers out of an office with two chairs, two clerks, and a small map of the world. Yet somehow The Prize, which begins on BBC2 at 9pm tomorrow evening, manages to put it all on screen. Not that there is anything particularly unusual about the technique which, even today, is probably best exemplified by the Thames Television series The World At War: extracts from archives, supplemented by still photographs, are combined with new interviews from people with long memories, and in the case of The Prize frequent up-summers from Yergin. Then the parts are sewn together with a powerful spoken script. The American version, which was available for preview, is narrated by the admirably unintrusive Donald Sutherland, but on BBC2 the job will be done by actor Andrew Sachs - one of the best in the business. From a British point of view, what seems a little worrying is that this is a form where Britain once excelled, but The World At War appeared 20 years ago and, although we have subsequently had excellent series from Peter Pagnamenta and Brian Lapping (All Our Working Lives and End Of Empire), they were made in 1984 and 1985. The Americans, however, appear to be on a roll. Not so long ago America's tiny public service broadcasting outfit, PBS, produced The Civil War, a magnificent example of the classical documentary, and now here they are with The Prize. British programme makers must look to their laurels. The series begins with the discovery that 'rock oil' could supply cheaper fuel for oil lamps than whale oil, and proceeds via the history of Standard Oil, Royal Dutch, Shell and BP to the two world wars, the rise of the motor car, the Middle East wars and the development of OPEC. It ends by looking to the future, when environmental considerations may become even more powerful than the multinational oil companies. There are moments when you are reminded of schools programmes, and times when more information would be welcome, but they are rare. Most of the time this series is as engrossing as Dallas. Produced by William Cran, it uses a different director for each of the eight programmes, which are broadly chronological, and each is - pleasingly - slightly different in form. Tomorrow's opening episode is built around two fascinating people: John D. Rockefeller, one of those ruthless Christians who would do anything, often destroying people's livelihoods, in order to make money, much of which he then gave to charity; and Ida Tarbell, whose father was one of those damaged by Rockefeller and who became one of America's earliest investigative journalists, writing the articles which eventually smashed Rockefeller's Standard Oil to pieces. Larger-than-life individuals are also at the centre of next week's episode, but the structure is necessarily different because more people have become involved. There are the Nobel brothers, known to most of us for dynamite and prizes, who developed the Russian oil industry; Marcus Samuel, Lord Mayor of London, whose family firm imported shells to make boxes for Victorian ladies and who named the world's first tanker fleet 'Cowrie', 'Murex' and so on, and the Shell company itself; Henri Deterding, whose Royal Dutch company combined with Shell; and Winston Churchill, who set in train a momentous sequence of events when, as First Lord of the Admiralty, he persuaded the British government to buy 51 per cent of Anglo-Persian, later BP. When you think about it there is no other product, not coal, nor steel, nor cotton, and no other business, not even the food industry, which has had such profound and universal effects on life on this planet as has oil. That alone does not make a good documentary series, of course, but since The Prize happens to be an outstanding piece of work it does make for compelling viewing.</p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Technology: The verdict on Alvey's worth When the Pounds 350m Alvey research programme in information technology was launched with strong support from the British government in 1983, it was billed as the answer to the UK electronics industry's flagging international competitiveness. Yet four years after the programme ended, the UK electronics industry's position is worse than ever. Its market share has declined further - even at home - the national IT deficit has grown and British companies have withdrawn from important technologies and product markets. So was Alvey, which received Pounds 200m in government subsidies and directly involved about 5,000 people, a waste of time and money? Or did the programme yield some benefits which will prove their worth over the longer term? A detailed evaluation, commissioned by the government and conducted by the universities of Sussex and Manchester*, concludes that, from a purely technical standpoint, Alvey chose sensible targets and achieved most of them. Substantial progress was made in advancing the frontiers of important computing technologies, including very large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits, software engineering and intelligent knowledge-based systems. The study argues that the programme also expanded Britain's R&amp;D capacity and gave a fillip to its research community. But it is more ambiguous about the importance of collaboration as a stimulus to research. Only 22 per cent of industrial research teams said they saw Alvey as a way to form new links with competitors, though 71 per cent of those who did planned to continue working with partners after the programme ended. There is also more than a hint that government subsidies were an influential factor for some industrial participants. The study finds that, left to themselves, some companies would simply have axed research work in several technologies which Alvey was intended to promote. The study argues that it was probably unrealistic to expect a long-term research programme to produce a decisive short-term improvement in industry performance. It also says Alvey would have benefitted from the involvement of IT users, which would have made it more market-oriented. However, the authors criticise industry for not seizing commercial opportunities more aggressively. They say that only 17 per cent of the industry teams involved said the results were regularly used by their companies to make marketable products - a proportion the study calls 'disappointing'. A third of Alvey researchers said their employers showed little interest in the programme. Many found it hard to get money from their companies to exploit their research commercially, while the companies lacked the production skills to apply it properly. Though companies which kept R&amp;D separated from production achieved the best technical results in Alvey, the research was exploited most effectively in the market by those which integrated R&amp;D closely with senior management functions. Factors over which industry had little or no control were also to blame for the poor take-up of Alvey technology - in particular a chronic shortage of well-educated staff and a shortage of 'patient' capital to back long-term investment. The authors suggest that the takeover by the UK's General Electric Company of the semiconductor interests of Plessey and Ferranti could provide a base from which UK industry could use Alvey research to attack world markets. However, the study argues that Japanese and US companies are far better equipped to put collaborative research to profitable use. Alvey's most enduring economic contribution, it concludes, may be to enhance the UK's ability to attract direct investments by those companies. * Evaluation of the Alvey Programme.

			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> SEN. LEVIN IS FINDING THE 'PEACE DIVIDEND' TO BE A TOUGH ACT TO FOLLOW;  </P> <P> POLITICS: CONSTITUENTS DEMAND TO KNOW HOW THE MONEY SAVED FROM DEFENSE CUTS  WILL BE SPENT. THE RENEWED ATTENTION TO DOMESTIC ISSUES IS LIKELY TO INFLUENCE  CONGRESS.  </P> <P> When Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) stopped by the Modern Medical Pharmacy recently  to ask directions to a nearby television station, proprietor Joseph Grimaudo  took advantage of his captive audience.  </P> <P> "We're really seeing history change," the exuberant pharmacist told Levin as he  trailed the senator out the front door. "Take some of the money from armaments  and give it to the people. . . . There are people (on Medicare and Medicaid)  who gotta have oxygen and they can't get it."  </P> <P> When Levin finished a meeting on school drug problems with local officials the  next morning in Allen Park, south of Detroit, a radio reporter asked if the  improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations means that the American military can now  help more with interdiction of drug smugglers.  </P> <P> At his next stop, Levin chatted with a group of fifth-graders in nearby South  Rockwood and picked up on the theme, suggesting that an easing of international  tensions may mean that the United States can use some of its defense dollars  for other purposes. Teachers standing in the back of the room did not miss a  beat in letting him know where they thought the money should go. "Education,"  they shouted.  </P> <P> Nearly everywhere he went in dawn-to-dusk travels around largely blue-collar,  ethnic communities outside Detroit, Levin was peppered with questions about the  waning of the Cold War and its implications for the United States.  </P> <P> With family ties stretching back into Eastern and Central Europe, many of  Levin's Detroit-area constituents, who include thousands of Democrats who voted  for Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984 and George Bush last year, remained  skeptical about Soviet intentions and apprehensive about continued upheaval in  their ancestral homelands.  </P> <P> But visions of sugar plums were already dancing in many heads. Even among the  skeptics, the dominant mood was one of hope and rising expectations, tempered  by a concern over U.S. economic and fiscal problems that is deepened by  shakiness in Michigan's auto industry.  </P> <P> Some saw investment and trade opportunities for the United States, even for  themselves. But most, like Grimaudo, saw opportunities for expansion of  domestic initiatives, ranging from schools to environmental protection, that  had been starved for funds during the military buildup of the early 1980s. Few  appeared to heed the warnings of President Bush and others that it is far too  early to start spending the so-called "peace dividend."  </P> <P> Judging by Levin's trip home, the unleashing of a pent-up demand for attention  to domestic needs, which for some included reduction of the nation's budget  deficit, appears likely to influence Congress as it heads into its 1990  election-year session. It also holds out the possibility of a profound change  in the political direction of the country as it heads into a markedly different  decade.  </P> <P> "I think it's going to change politics down to the grass-roots level," said  Carl Marlinga, the Democratic prosecutor of Macomb County. "We're going to  think of the world in a different way . . . without a military nuance to  everything we talk about . . . . No longer are we going to have to sacrifice  everything to prepare for war."  </P> <P> But Michigan Republican Party Chairman Spencer Abraham cautioned that foreign  affairs is usually a cutting issue only in times of crisis and that candidates  who seek to exploit the issue are usually hurt more than they are helped. "Take  an extreme position either way and you're likely to be hurt," he said.  </P> <P> The sword's double edge is apparent in the case of Levin, a senior member of  the Senate Armed Services Committee and an ardent foe of moves to expand the  nation's nuclear weapons arsenal. Levin, who won his two previous races by  narrow margins, has been targeted by Republicans as a top prospect for an upset  next year.  </P> <P> While Levin drew nods in the Detroit area for his suggestions that some defense  money can now be channeled to deficit reduction or domestic needs, he is  getting "beat up like hell," according to an aide in his state office, in  communities around Wurtsmith Air Force Base in northern Michigan, which was  just chosen as one of seven sites for the new rail-based system for the MX  missile.  </P> <P> Levin opposes the 10-warhead nuclear missile and its new rail-garrison basing  mode, while Rep. Bill Schuette (R-Mich.), the leading contender for the GOP  Senate nomination, is trumpeting his support for the program and welcoming the  missiles to Michigan.  </P> <P> Levin's weaponry problems do not end with the MX, however. As chairman of the  Armed Services subcommittee on conventional forces and as an advocate of  strengthening these forces as opposed to nuclear weaponry, Levin has championed  the M-1 tank, Michigan's single largest defense project. It accounts for  thousands of jobs at its Warren, Mich., assembly plant and at other production  and engineering facilities across the state. But to Levin's dismay, the M-1  appears a more likely casualty of Pentagon-planned military cutbacks than does  the MX.  </P> <P> Only days after the Defense Department designated Wurtsmith for the  MX-on-rails, word leaked from the Pentagon that the Army had proposed to end  production of the tank after fiscal 1991 as part of its contribution to savings  mandated by budget cutters.  </P> <P> For others here, the defense spending issue is broader than any single weapons  system, touching off a re-examination of priorities in a world in which tanks  as well as missiles appear to be headed for the arms-control bargaining table.  </P> <P> Take Henry J. Luks, for example.  </P> <P> Luks, grandson of Polish immigrants, runs a small alarm systems business in  East Detroit. At a luncheon in Mt. Clemens, he asked Levin about the  implications of the East-West thaw for the U.S. and Michigan economies.  </P> <P> "If we can reduce some of the defense burden we've had to carry" and use the  money for education and other endeavors that will enhance the nation's  productivity, the United States will benefit greatly, Levin responded  cautiously.  </P> <P> Luks seemed a little disappointed and said later that he felt more exhilaration  than he detected in Levin.  </P> <P> "I may be wrong, but it just seems (like) such a golden opportunity out there  for everyone . . . a great big pipeline for U.S. products," he said.  </P> <P> Does this mean he believes the United States can start turning its swords into  plowshares? "We can cut nuclear weapons that can already blow up the world a  hundred times over," said Luks, "but until we see a little more good faith  (from the Soviets), I don't think we should start pulling out troops. I guess  I'm not ready to run up and give them a kiss and a hug, not yet, anyway."  </P> <P> But he would like to do business with them, Luks said. "Think they'd like to  buy some alarm systems?" he asked.  </P></p>

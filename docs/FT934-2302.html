			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / The Russian Elections: New man of power pulls on velvet gloves - Zhirinovsky tones down the rhetoric for Chrystia Freeland and John Lloyd 'We are ready to serve in the cabinet,' said Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky yesterday, emphatic behind his large desk. 'I would, with great reluctance, be prepared to be prime minister, but better if others were.' The leader of the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) was holding court in his fourth floor party headquarters. The man to whom Russia and much of the world looks - with hope or fear - for a sign of what he will do with his victory is clear as to his tactics: he wants power, and power at the very centre of the state. His reluctance to be prime minister is probably genuine. His second-in-command, Mr Alexander Vengerovsky - who sits a little to his side, with a licence to speak - is being promoted as the party's choice for the post they believe they deserve. Beyond that, according to Mr Zhirinovsky, they will claim the posts of foreign, defence, security and interior ministers: the 'power ministries' responsible for order and external relations. They will demand that the present holders resign - especially hated is Mr Andrei Kozyrev, foreign minister - and that Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy premier, and Mr Anatoly Chubais, deputy premier for privatisation, go too. The first bill they will promote in the lower house (state duma) when they take their seats in January is one establishing a national guard. This, for all the moderation they now insist is their true face, is the party of law and order. It is a posture which has allowed them to claim the voice of the Russian people. Mr Zhirinovsky also won because he leads a party united under his unquestioned leadership, capable of projecting simple, clear messages addressing popular concerns and playing up popular prejudice. As he comes into his scruffy, pullulating offices, the word runs through the crowd 'Shef idyot]' ('the leader's coming'). He strides in, erect and vigorous, shaking the hands of the petitioners awaiting him. In his office, lined with portraits of Russian generals and beneath a party slogan proclaiming 'Freedom - LDP - Law', he talks to an old man with veteran's ribbons brought in greet him, telling him to 'go and see my colleague; all your problems will be dealt with, without delay, all, all'. He is unfazed by his sudden power. He simply denies previous positions no longer needed. 'How many times must I tell you? (beating the desk). We have no claims on other countries] As for the Russians in the other former Soviet states, they either stay where they are or come back. They are free to do as they like.' Along the hall is a queue of prospective party members to swell the claimed membership figure of 176,000, already massive for a Russian party. One of them, Mr Alexander Denisov (40), says he does not want to offend the Americans but 'Kozyrev was giving them our country.' He was a photographer but, he says, left his trade rather than be forced to take pornographic pictures of women. On the way into the office, Mr Pavel Kuzovkin (28) presides over a stall selling black T-shirts with skulls and demons on them, and tapes by Madonna and Michael Jackson. He is a designer of nuclear plants fallen into petty trading, but he 'likes Zhirinovsky because he let me set up this stall. Yeltsin I don't like, he makes my life harder'. Mr Zhirinovsky, having been carried to victory in the polls on a wave of populist rhetoric, is now taking great pains to position himself as the leader of Russia's political centre. Occasionally he slips up. Yesterday, for example, after emphatically insisting that he opposed all forms of racial, religious or ethnic discrimination, Mr Zhirinovsky declared: 'It is true that now there is a wave of anti-Semitism in the country, but we are not the ones who provoke it, rather, it is being provoked by people of Jewish nationality.' But when he remembers he is no longer on the campaign trail, he is the soul of moderation. At home, he says he leads 'the party of compromise', which is willing to work with President Boris Yeltsin, or, if the president prefers, serve as 'a constructive opposition'. Abroad, the man who waxed poetic about 'Russian soldiers washing their boots in the Indian ocean' in an autobiography published earlier this year now denies any expansionist aims. 'We are the party of peace, of co-operation, of culture,' Mr Zhirinovsky assured the FT yesterday. 'We will never take a single step toward the west. I will tell you ten times over, we are against the return to Russia of the territories which belonged to the Soviet Union.' Well aware that a large part of his party's appeal lies in the ambiguity of its platform, he is reluctant to specify the policies he will advocate from his new position of power. The most he will say is that the Liberal Democrats will pursue four goals: an end to all economic subsidies to former Soviet republics; the export of Russian armaments; the withdrawal of the Russian army from all foreign territories; and the creation of 'civil society' in Russia. It is on economic policy, a 'no-win' issue if ever there was one, that Mr Zhirinovsky most assiduously refuses to be pinned down. Apart from the windfall he expects from arms exports - waving a metal flask a Russian factory is producing instead of nuclear submarines to illustrate the folly of defence industry conversion - he is reluctant to describe how he plans to raise Russians' standard of living. Triumphantly attired in a tuxedo and flanked by his shadow cabinet at a news conference yesterday, the most Mr Zhirinovsky would say was that he favoured 'a mixed economy' with equal rights for the state and private sectors. He is more expansive when it comes to foreign policy. Apparently having undergone an overnight metamorphosis from expansionist to isolationist, and sublimely untroubled by previous pledges to extend Russian territory, he now says he does not want 'a single metre' of territory beyond Russia's current borders. Suddenly more liberal than Mr Yeltsin's own government, Mr Zhirinovsky even says that he has no objections to eastern European membership of Nato. 'It is up to them.' This conciliatory stance is clearly intended to make collaboration with the Liberal Democrats more palatable for Mr Yeltsin. Indeed, Mr Zhirinovsky, who expects to meet the president soon, is confident that 'the president has a positive feeling toward us, and toward me personally, because we have taken a centrist position'. If Mr Yeltsin chooses not to co-operate with this kinder, gentler incarnation, that is not a problem either. Mr Zhirinovsky's eyes remain firmly fixed on the ultimate prize in Russian politics, the presidency, which has become a more powerful post now that the draft constitution has been voted into law by Sunday's referendum. Mr Zhirinovsky, who says that he will not insist that Mr Yeltsin stick to his earlier promise to hold elections in 1994, is confident of winning whenever a vote is held. 'My only fear is that I might be the only strong candidate for the presidency,' he says. 'I would not like the presidential marathon to be too soft.' Apart from a burning belief that it is his personal destiny to save Russia, Mr Zhirinovsky's confidence is based on his realisation that he can communicate a message which is compelling for millions of Russian voters. This message, emblazoned on thousands of campaign posters, is his promise 'to raise Russia off its knees]' Whether advocating isolationist or expansionist policies, Mr Zhirinovsky's consistent promise is to ruthlessly put the interests of the people of Russia above everything else. He is vague indeed when it comes to the ways in which he will make Russians rich, but his is the boldest voice promising to make Russians strong.</p>

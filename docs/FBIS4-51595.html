			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by WPK Secretary Kim Chung-nin at the central report </F> meeting marking May Day held at the People's Palace of Culture  in Pyongyang -- live]    [Text] Comrades: Today, we are meaningfully marking May  Day, the international holiday of the workers around the world,  at a time when all working people, including the working class,  are vigorously waging the general onward movement of socialism  in the high revolutionary spirit under the banner of the chuche  idea and under the anti-imperialist banner for independence.    On this day, I warmly congratulate the entire working class  and working people, who are striving hard for the development  and enrichment of the socialism of our own style and the victory  of the chuche revolutionary cause, under the authority and in  the name of the Workers Party of Korea [WPK] Central Committee.  [applause]    I extend militant greetings to the workers and people of  different strata in South Korea, who are fighting courageously  for the anti-U.S. struggle for independence, democratization,  the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, and the right to  live, looking upon the Republic as the beacon of hope. [applause]    I offer warm compatriot greetings to .7 million fellow  countrymen in Japan and all other fellow countrymen abroad, who  are retaining the nation's sovereignty and honor and are  vigorously waging the patriotic struggle for the prosperity of  the socialist fatherland and the independent, peaceful  reunification of the fatherland. [applause]    I, in the name of the WPK Central Committee and the Korean  working class, extend militant greetings and firm solidarity to  the working class and working people around the world, who are  fighting for independence, peace, social progress, and justice  while opposing all sorts of domination and subordination.  [applause]    Comrades: Over a century of history has passed since the  working class, who has a noble mission to realize the ideal of  mankind and to forever relinquish the exploitation system from  earth, began celebrating the militant holiday demonstrating its  international solidarity and united strength.    This period has been a history of a righteous struggle and  brilliant victory waged by the working class throughout the  world that strenuously struggled for the freedom and liberation  of the maltreated proletarian masses against the imperialist  reactionary forces, holding aloft the banner of unity.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Unity is  the mightiest weapon of the working class. Since its first days  in the arena of history, the working class has always regarded  unity as its most precious weapon in the struggle against  international capital, and has won formidable struggles on the  strength of unity.    The historic mission of the working class lies in building  socialism, communism, and a new world in which the independence  of humans can be fully realized. The working class has waged  audacious struggles befitting the leading class of the  revolution to build a new society free from exploitation and  oppression by breaking the chains of capital. The working  masses have demolished the bulwark of capitalism and  triumphantly blazed the trail of socialism with the weapon of  unity, the might of unity, overcoming manifold difficulties and  trials.    Thanks to the international working class' long and  difficult  struggles to realize independence, a revolutionary upheaval has  been brought about in the development of human history and the  features of the world have been fundamentally changed.    In an old era, the working popular masses were suppressed,  exploited, and forced to endure all sorts of social unfairness  for a long time. However, such an era has ended and a new one  has opened in which all nations of all countries can pioneer  their fate voluntarily.    Breaking through the capitalist and imperialist positions  which had dominated the world for centuries and opening a broad  avenue to socialism -- this is the great change achieved on the  course of implementing the working class' revolutionary cause  and the historic triumph achieved by the world revolutionary  people with blood. [applause]    The working class' cause is accompanied by the serious  struggle of whether it is socialism or capitalism, and thus this  can never be realized smoothly. Under the condition in which  the reactionaries of history, in united forces, are running wild  to desperately block the popular masses' independent onward  march, and the imperialists and reactionaries are perpetrating  endless attacks and all kinds of armed maneuvers, there could be  unexpected difficulties and heartbreaking sacrifices in the  confrontation between revolution and antirevolution.    Amid the imperialists and reactionaries' antisocialist  blockade, which has become unprecedentedly vicious in recent  years, socialism in some countries, which had been defended and  developed for tens of years, has suffered a setback and  capitalism has been restored. Taking advantage of this abnormal  situation, the imperialists and reactionaries vilify the idea of  socialism, the idea of the working class, itself as wrong,  claiming that socialism has met its end. But this is no more  than a reactionary sophism of the foes of socialism and its  renegades. Even though socialism has suffered in some  countries, this is nothing but a limited and temporary  phenomenon.    Socialism, which has vibrant vitality, is the future of  mankind. No force can hold back the basic trend of the history  of mankind marching toward socialism.    Today, billions of working people around the world are  waging  the struggle for the right to live and freedom in defense of  independence. In particular, former socialist countries are now  vigorously pushing ahead with the struggle to carry out their  independent demands, being well aware of the fact through their  actual experiences that capitalism only devoted to the pursuit  of money will only bring poverty to their working popular masses  and that socialism is the only way to live.    Everywhere in the world now, fraternal unity is being  rebuilt, and communists and the working popular masses are  rising in the grand struggle for socialism.    The widespread movement for the revival of socialism is  being  waged in the countries where it has suffered a setback. The  extensiveness of such a mass movement and political struggles  can be clearly seen from the fact that the number of foreign  parties signed the Pyongyang Declaration "Let Us Defend and  Advance the Socialist Cause" has increased from 70 to 213 in two  years.    All these facts vividly show that no matter how the  imperialists and those who attempt to return to the bourgeois  vilify the idea of socialism, socialism is alive in the hearts  of thousands of people; mighty revolutionary parties for  socialism still exist in the world; and no force can check the  working class' struggle for socialism.    If the international working class is to defend the cause of  socialism and promote it, it must constantly strengthen the  driving force of the revolution with a correct guiding idea and  must resolutely uphold the principles of socialism and  strengthen solidarity based on independence. This is an  important lesson that the history of the international working  class struggle which has suffered setbacks and twists has taught.    The working class of our country has victoriously waged  an arduous struggle to defend and adhere to socialism, firmly  upholding the chuche idea--the guiding idea of the revolution of  our times founded by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song--and  under the outstanding leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il, thus always being loyal to the national and  international duties.    The working class of our country upheld the great leader  Comrade Kim Il-song as the center of unity and the center of  leadership. By dint of this, the working class of our country  was able to enter the road of a new struggle with precise  struggle line and with organized force.    The respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song founded  the immortal chuche idea and awakened and organized the broad  sections working masses including the working class under its  banner, thus providing the revolution with its strong main  force. Based on this, he led the difficult and complicated  Korean revolution along the single road of victory.    Over the past years, our people were single-handedly able to  win a shining victory in the long, arduous anti-Japanese  revolutionary struggle against the 1 million-strong well-armed  Japanese imperialist army. This was possible only because the  great leader Comrade Kim Il-song organized the anti-Japanese  patriotic force of various strata, including workers and  peasants, into an independent revolutionary force under the  anti-Japanese banner, rousing this force to the anti-Japanese  war, while continuously expanding and strengthening it    Our working class and people, firmly united around the party  and the leader, established our-style people's democratic system  free from exploitation, oppression, poverty, and unemployment in  the northern half of the republic after the liberation under  very difficult and complicated circumstances by their  independent chuche might. In the fiercely-fought three-year  Fatherland Liberation War, they won a great victory of defeating  the U.S. imperialists, the leader of world imperialism, for the  first time in history. [applause]    Our working class and people waged a steadfast socialist  revolution and socialist construction in the period of trials  after the war as well based on strong chuche force, turning our  country into a strong independent, self-reliant, and  self-defending socialist state.    Truly, the entire course of our revolution that involved  stern trials and epochal changes has been a proud triumphant  history in which we strengthened the independent main force of  the revolution and made a long march flushed with victories  based on its might under the leadership of the great leader  Comrade Kim Il-song.    The revolutionary cause of the working class does not end in  one generation. It is a cause inherited and completed  generation to generation. To achieve an ultimate completion of  this historical cause, the problem of leadership succession must  be solved properly. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is an  outstanding ideologist and theoretician, great statesman, great  military strategist, and the paragon of a true loyalist and  dutiful child who has both literary and military accomplishments  and is distinguished in his loyalty and filial duty.    The sacred chuche revolutionary cause pioneered by the great  leader is brilliantly inherited and developed in our country  today by upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who has  excellent traits and qualifications of the leader [suryong] of  the working class and the leader [yongdoja] of the people, at  the supreme top [choego suwi] of the party, the state, and the  army. [applause]    The ultimate victory of the chuche revolutionary cause is  firmly ensured because the entire party membership, all the  people, and the entire army uphold the great leader's lofty will  in wholehearted unity around the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il and are exerting their creative might thoroughly in the  revolution and construction in conformity with the intent of the  party and the leader.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has wisely led the  struggle to accelerate the revolution and construction based on  the might of the wholehearted unity of the leader, the party,  and the masses by persistently keeping up the three  revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--as a  general line of socialist construction in conformity with the  new conditions after the socialist revolution triumphed and a  socialist system was established in our country.    What is most important in accelerating socialist  construction and defending, adhering, and adding luster to the  cause of socialism is to arm the members of the main force of  the revolution firmly with the socialist ideology so that they  can cherish socialism as their firm faith.    Whether we can arm people with socialist ideology or not is  a  fundamental problem connected with the fate of socialism. The  superiority of socialism is the superiority of ideology, and the  might of socialism is the might of ideology. Therefore,  neglecting the ideological revolution is losing the life line in  building socialism. For this reason, our party has consistently  maintained the principle of giving definite priority to the  ideological revolution in the struggle to build socialism, and  is continuously deepening and developing it in conformity with  the advance of the revolution and construction.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il further developed and  enriched the socialist ideology based on the chuche idea, and  exercised his wise leadership so that all the people can make  the chuche socialist ideology their faith and morality. By so  doing, he ensured that our socialism takes root deep in our  people's hearts and actual life.    With firm faith that socialism means victory for those who  keep it and death for those who abandon it, the working class  and people of our country today are devoting themselves to the  rewarding struggle to further strengthen socialist might with  overflowing faith and optimism for the future. The communist  ethos of working and living in a revolutionary manner, helping  and encouraging each other from the principle of collectivism of  one for all and all for one, is highly displayed by them.    The ranks of unheralded heroes, men of merit, and  forerunners  of communist virtue who wage a devoted struggle silently are  increasing with each passing day. The leader, the party, and  the masses are firmly united as a sociopolitical living organism  sharing life, death, and destiny so that the entire society  consists of a great revolutionary family of loyalists and  dutiful children. This is the true feature of our society of  which we can boast with pride to the world. [applause]    This shows that the slogan of abolishing class, which was  raised aloft on the very first day when the working class  appeared on the stage of history, has come true in our country  today.    Today when we can clearly see at hand the day of the  complete  victory of socialism under the wise leadership of the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, we take great pride and faith in  the superiority of our-style socialism which we ourselves have  chosen and pioneered on our own and its future.    Socialist society is the world for the working class.  Our-style socialism, in particular, is the chuche socialism in  which the party and the popular masses are firmly united and  chuche is firmly established in all areas--political, economic,  cultural, and military. It is the popular mass-centered  socialism in which the people's independent and creative life  thrive fully and in which the working class and the working  people are masters of everything. It is the most solid and  vital invincible socialism in which society develops  continuously by the might of wholehearted unity.    The most precious wealth that our party brought forth in the  long struggle for socialism under the banner of the chuche idea  is the realization of the wholehearted unity of the leader, the  party, and the masses. Our wholehearted unity is the  ideological, volitional, moralistic, and fidelity-oriented unity  and cohesion, and a revolutionary unity having eternal vitality.  There is no power in the world that can destroy our  wholehearted unity. [applause]    The complete unity among the leader [suryong], the party,  and the masses, which we have achieved, is the basic factor, in  resolutely smashing [chipusigo] any challenge of the  imperialists and determinedly defending and safeguarding  our-style socialism, and it is a strong driving force with which  to brave a raging wind of antisocialism and to forcefully  accelerate the socialist construction.    Indeed, the greatest dignity and pride of our working class  and people are to build an invincible socialist powerful state  which opens the path to becoming ever victorious only with its  trust in its own strength and with its own might, while carrying  out everything in our own way holding faith in chuche, in an  unflinching manner in the teeth of any change in situation and  the pressure from the imperialists.    Our working class and people are setting store by our-style  socialism like their own lives and are full of the revolutionary  determination to defend socialism to the end with the firm faith  in the justness of the socialist cause and its future path.    The revolutionary cause of the working class is the  international one, and the Korean revolution is a part of the  world revolution. To consolidate the solidarity with the  international revolutionary forces is an (?important) guarantee  to advance the victory of the Korean revolution and carry  forward the socialist cause throughout the world.    The slogan "The world's people defending independence,  unite!" is a slogan for struggle which all people of our era  should hold jointly. In the preceding period, our country's  working class exerted itself to consolidate the militant unity  and international solidarity with the working classes and  progressive people of all world countries on the basis of its  (?faith) in independence and socialism under the party's  leadership. It actively contributed to the struggle to reliably  defend the eastern outpost of socialism and make the whole world  independent.    Under the anti-imperialist, pro-independence banner, we have  supported the anti-imperialist, national liberation struggle of  the world's oppressed people and the revolutionary movement of  all countries' people and have endlessly developed the  relationships of friendship and cooperation with those countries  that treat our country favorably, including developing  countries. We have firmly struggled to check and frustrate the  imperialists' maneuvers of aggression and war and to defend the  world's peace and security.    Our party has always adhered consistently to the principle  of  complete equality and mutual respect on which to solve, in  conformity with the common interest of our people and the  world's people and in an independent way, all problems arising  from foreign relations, respecting other countries' sovereignty  while thoroughly safeguarding our people's national sovereignty.    Our country's international relations have endlessly been  developed and our people have numerous friends and sympathizers  [tongjongjadul] everywhere in the world thanks to our party's  correct foreign policy based on the idea of independence, peace,  and friendship and its active activities in (?foreign relations).    The experience of our revolution, which is forcefully  advancing the socialist cause even under the unusually difficult  international environment, has shown that when the working  classes of all the world's countries struggle jointly in firm  unity supporting and cooperating with each other under the  anti-imperialist, pro-independence revolutionary banner, they,  as unified international revolutionary forces, can vanquish the  imperialists and certainly build a peaceful and prosperous new  world of independence, while defending each individual country's  sovereignty and independence.    In the future, too, our country's working class will  actively  contribute to accelerating the completion of our revolution and  making the whole world independent by endlessly strengthening  the militant unity and cooperation with the working classes and  progressive people of the whole world. [applause]    Comrades,    Because of the international reactionaries' vicious  challenge, the working class' revolutionary movement to build a  new world of independence and peace is today entering a grave  phase of history. The imperialists and reactionary forces are  all the more running amok to crush [apsal] the revolutionary  cause of the working class and the socialist cause, and here,  they are especially turning the brunt of the attack toward our  Republic, the fortress of socialism.    The U.S. imperialists are all the more openly carrying out  anti-Republic oppressive commotions in the international arena  by finding fault with our nuclear issue, thus clinging to the  military adventure to crush our socialist cause. Our nuclear  issue, which the U.S. imperialists and their followers are  babbling [ttodunun] about, is a product of the antisocialist and  anti-Republic maneuvers the U.S. imperialists are persistently  pursuing.    Whenever they have had the opportunity, the U.S. warmongers  have made violent remarks by saying that pressure must be put on  North Korea through a practical action and so on, thus openly  revealing their attempt to resume the Team Spirit joint military  exercise. Also, as part of an oppressive commotion against us,  they are carrying out all kinds of military commotions such as  deploying from the continental United States Naval ships,  including the Patriot missile unit and a nuclear powered  aircraft carrier, into South Korea, and are scheming to deploy  more new military equipment.    The treacherous Kim Yong-sam clique undisguisedly made  public its plan to invade the North, which had already been  worked out under the instigation of the U.S. imperialists, made  the entire puppet Army assume a posture of attacking the North  under a special alert order, and while babbling about a strong  punishment and retaliation on someone, it is blowing a very  provocative bugle of war to link this as an opportunity to  invade the North and achieve reunification.    The Japanese reactionaries are also persistently obstructing  the resolution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula by  talking about a special inspection [tukpyol sachal] and  sanctions. They are revealing the aggressive attempt to come  forth in the military action against us in case of an emergency.    Because of the reckless military threat and confrontational  maneuvers by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet  clique, the danger of war is increasing by the minute on the  Korean peninsula. The U.S. imperialists and the international  reactionaries are running amok to isolate and suffocate our  Republic and crush our socialism by finding fault with the  nuclear issue, but if they think that they can submit us through  any kind of pressure, threat, and blackmail, that is nothing but  an anachronistic fantasy.    However precious peace is, our dignified people will not by  any means beg for it, and are fully prepared to answer war with  war and dialogue with dialogue. We are possessed with the wise  leadership of the great leader and the respected and beloved  supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il; the complete unity of  the leader, the party, and the masses; and a one-a-match-for-100  revolutionary force that can defeat in a single blow any strong  enemy; and a strong self-supporting economy.    Our working class and people will never tolerate [yongnap]  our national dignity and sovereignty being hurt  [kondurinunkosul]. If the enemy dares to launch an attack, the  whole country will turn into a place of guns and shells  [chongpotan], giving the enemy only corpses and death.    Our working class and all the workers should march forward  invariably upholding the banner of unity in order to continue to  forcefully carry forward the socialist cause of chuche while  smashing the maneuvers of the imperialists and reactionaries  against socialism and the Republic.    The first, the second, and the third priorities, in terms of  the basic way to advance the socialist construction while being  confronted with the imperialist reactionary forces, are all to  achieve the single-hearted unity of the revolutionary ranks.  Because of the might of the single-hearted unity nothing can  destroy, the invincibility of our-style ever-victorious  socialism exists and the bright future path to the revolutionary  cause of chuche is firmly guaranteed.    The complete unity among the leader, the party, and the  masses, which constitutes the eternal vitality of our country's  socialism, originates in the endless love toward and faith in  people held by the great leader and the dear (?leader) and in  people's boundless sense of admiration and their absolute sense  of trust in the leader [yongdoja].    Upholding the great leader and the dear comrade leader and  more firmly rallying around the party, our working class and all  the people should be firmly prepared as genuine communist  revolutionaries of chuche who deeply bear in mind their loyalty  to the party and the leader as their firm faith, conscience, and  sense of moral obligation and highly display such a spirit in  every moment of their life, solidifying in every way the  single-hearted unity of our revolutionary ranks.    Upholding with our heart the party's militant slogan as to  accomplishing the socialist cause to the end while all the  party, all the people, and all the Army are united in  single-heartedness, we should resolutely smash--with the might  of the single-hearted unity in which the leader, the party, and  the masses are in complete unity--all the enemy's challenges and  obstructions against socialism, thereby accomplishing the  socialist cause of chuche to the end.    An (?important) issue in defending, safeguarding, and  carrying forward the socialist cause of chuche at the present  time is to defend the purity of socialist ideology and hold fast  to the basic principle of socialism in a consistent way.    If the socialist ideology is shaken, the basic principle of  socialism will be renounced and, then, the socialist system will  degenerate and collapse [pyonjildoeo homulojigi maryonimnida].    It is necessary to be armed with the chuche idea in order to  firmly defend the purity of the socialist ideology. The chuche  idea is the revolutionary one which most correctly reflects the  aspirations and demands of the working class and it is the  leading guideline of our era's revolution which illuminates the  basic principle and method of socialist and communist  construction.    Thanks to the great chuche idea, the status and role of the  working class as the leading class of revolution have been  scientifically illuminated; and a new world in which the working  class serves as the masters of everything under the brilliant  banner of the chuche idea is being unfolded.    Only when it thoroughly carries through the basic principle  of the chuche idea can the working class see realized its  demands that it enjoy independent rights and a genuine life,  while breaking away from all kinds of restrictions and  oppression and can it see the cause of remodeling the whole  society after the pattern of the working class brilliantly  accomplished.    By being firmly armed with the socialist ideology of  chuche, our working class and all the people should resolutely  defend their chuche-oriented position and the revolutionary  principle under all circumstances, reject revisionism,  doctrinism, and flunkeyism in a thorough-going manner, and  thoroughly smash the enemy's maneuver of conciliatory tactics of  trying to disintegrate [wahae] us through a reactionary  ideological and cultural blockade [pongsoe].    What is most important in defending, safeguarding, and  carrying forward the socialist cause in a victorious way is to  faithfully uphold the party's leadership. The party's  leadership is the life and soul of the working class and the  basic guarantee of all victories.    Only when it is faithful to the leadership of the party--its  vanguard organization--can the working class, the leading class  of revolution, smoothly carry out its mission and duty it holds  before the times and history.    Our era is the glorious one which shines thanks to the name  of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. A bright future path  to further prosperity and advancement, when we follow his  leadership, is firmly guaranteed. [applause]    All the working class and workers should hold the absolute  sense of respect for the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il every  time and everywhere and should live and fight on as the  lifeguards, shock brigade members, guards, and death-defying  corps members, loudly chanting the song of faith "Without you,  there is no fatherland; with you alone we can win!" upholding  his ideology and leadership.    In order to further illuminate our-style socialism, it is  necessary to consolidate the might of self-reliant economy and  highly display the superiority of our country's socialist system  by accelerating the socialist construction. The superiority of  the socialist system is demonstrated in people's independent and  creative living. To endlessly increase the people's living  standard is the highest principle of our party's activities.    The important purpose that our party has established a  period  of adjustment in the socialist economic construction and put  forth a new revolutionary economic strategy also lies in trying  to more smoothly guarantee the people's living standards.    By thoroughly accomplishing the party's revolutionary  economic strategy and forcefully waging the three revolutions,  ideological, technological, and cultural, our working class and  all the workers should help the popular masses' independent and  creative living be put into fuller bloom in all fields of their  social life, including political, economic, and cultural ones.    Upholding the party's militant slogan "Let us forcefully  accelerate the general onward march of socialism through the  revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude!" for which  all the party, the whole country, and all the people are  generally mobilized, we should thoroughly accomplish the  agriculture-first policy, light industry-first policy, and  trade-first policy with the spirit in which the speed of the  nineties is added to chollima, filled with the ever-victorious  confidence and should achieve a new great revolutionary upswing  on all fronts of socialist construction, including coal,  electricity, railroad transportation, and metal industries.    To end the national division and achieve the fatherland  reunification is the supreme task that our working class and  people can no longer put off. The great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song, the sun of the nation, has put forth the 10-point  program for the great unity of the whole nation for the  reunification of the country, thereby brilliantly illuminating  the path to achieving the national reconciliation and unity and  to establishing an independent, peaceful, and neutral reunified  state. He has taken all kinds of measures for their  materialization.    The 10-point program for the great unity of the whole nation  is the grand charter for reunification--the most aboveboard and  devoted to the country and people-- which embodies the pure  desire of the 70 million countrymen aspiring to achieve the  national reunification and prosperity in which the whole nation  is firmly united as one, transcending the differences in  ideologies, ideas, and systems. [applause]    The 10-point program for the great unity of the whole nation  for the reunification of the country is arousing wide sympathy  among the world's progressive people. The South Korean people  and the compatriots abroad are also waging a forceful struggle  to achieve by any means [kioi] the country's reunification in  the nineties under the banner of this 10-point program.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, however, is marching toward  the path to North-South confrontation, not to national  independence, and to national strife [tongjok sangjaeng], not to  peaceful reunification, while turning its face away from our  broadminded proposals and the whole nation's desire for  reunification.    Without checking and frustrating the maneuvers of the  splittists within and without, we can neither desire the  fatherland reunification nor the country's security and peace,  nor can our nation avoid the disasters of a nuclear war.    The South Korean puppets should give up their silly fantasy  of trying to block the fatherland reunification and harm their  compatriots, relying on the foreign forces; abrogate all kinds  of anticommunist, fascist evil laws, including the vicious  National Security Law; immediately release all people, including  patriotic figures fighting for the cause of reunification, who  have been illegally arrested and imprisoned; and show with acts  their genuine will for reunification.    The United States should stop its reckless maneuver of  obstructing Korea's reunification and threatening the security  on the Korean peninsula; no longer interfere with our country's  internal affairs; and withdraw without delay from South Korea  taking away all armed forces of aggression and lethal weapons.    Today, too, even political freedom and rights, and South  Korean workers' basic human right to live, under the U.S.  imperialists' occupation, are being ruthlessly trampled upon,  under the world's worst working hell.    The Kim Yong-sam civilian fascist clique, which has assumed  power while advocating building a society in which hard-working  people can live in opulence, is abusing the workers like horses  and bulls while appeasing and deceiving them under the  reactionary slogan of industrial peace.    The puppet clique is even carrying out a fascist violent act  of vicious suppression of the labor movement by even putting  into action a so-called emergency arbitration, while branding  the workers' just struggle for their right to live and for  democracy as the so-called collective egoism. The Kim Yong-sam  puppet regime is the most vicious blood-sucking one and the most  cunning and ruthless one against workers.    It is no coincidence that a slogan "Let us smash the Kim  Yong-sam regime, which kills workers!" has been shouted out  among the South Korean workers.    The only way for the South Korean workers to get out of  their present plight of a dead-end alley is to unite into a  struggle to realize the independence and democratization of  South Korean society and to achieve the country's reunification.    The South Korean workers should firmly unite under the  independent democratic labor unions and wage a struggle against  the civilian fascist dictatorship with the might of unity. In  firm unity with the people of all strata, including the youth  and students, they should build a new world of independence and  democracy in the land of the South. They should wage a more  daring struggle to realize the cause of the country's  reunification.    It is an intolerable national tragedy for one nation of the  same blood to live separated for half a century between the wall  of division imposed by outside forces. All the Korean  compatriots who love the country and are concerned about the  future of the nation should be united under the banner of  independence, the banner of the great unity of the whole nation,  and wage a pannational struggle to open a new phase for the  country's reunification by the independent strength of the  nation. [applause]    We will make every effort in the future as well to realize  the country's reunification by means of a confederal system  based on one nation and one state and two systems and two  governments according to the three principles of independence,  peaceful reunification, and great national unity.    Our people's just cause for national sovereignty and peace  and peaceful reunification of the country is receiving warm  support and encouragement from the broad sections of the people  of the world. I take this opportunity to express our gratitude  to the parties, governments, and people of all countries of the  world for their invariable sincere support and encouragement for  our people's just cause. At the same time, I express our  conviction that they will accord our people firm solidarity with  our people's reunification cause in the future as well.  [applause]    Today, the world situation is very tense and complicated,  and  the struggle between socialism and imperialism, between the  progressive and the reactionary is waged more acutely than ever  in the international arena. The prevailing situation demands  that the working class of all the countries of the world further  strengthen internationalist unity and solidarity for the victory  of the anti-imperialist cause for independence.    The cause of socialism is not only a national cause, but a  common cause of mankind. Therefore, its victory cannot be  expected without the joint struggle of the revolutionary people  of the world. Under the condition where the imperialists and  reactionaries are trampling upon the independence of the popular  masses with a combined force and are viciously maneuvering to  crush [apsal] the cause of socialism, the working class and  people of all countries of the world should wage a joint  struggle firmly united under the revolutionary banner of  anti-imperialist cause for independence in order to frustrate  the imperialists' interference and aggressive maneuvers and  realize the cause of independence of the entire world  successfully.    It is the firm will of our working class and people to  fulfill their sacred mission and responsibility for the cause of  independence of the Korean people and mankind by continuously  intensifying the international solidarity and joint struggle  with the working class of the entire world under the banner of  the great chuche idea and the banner of socialism.    The U.S. imperialists, bragging that they are the only  superpower on earth, are engaged in all sorts of tenacious  maneuvers, out of an ambition to dominate the world, to isolate  and stifle [chilsik sikigo] socialist countries, to block the  revival of socialism, and to prevent the developing countries  from following the road of socialism. Yet the antisocialist  maneuvers of the imperialists and reactionaries are doomed to  fail, and it is the law of the development of history that the  cause of socialism triumphs ultimately overcoming temporary  confusion.    Defending and adhering to socialism from the  antirevolutionary offensive of the imperialists and  reactionaries at this time is a common pending struggle task  facing the working class of the countries of the world. Under  the ideology of independence, peace, and friendship, our party  and people will continue to endlessly strengthen and develop the  ties of comradely unity and international solidarity with the  world's progressive people based on independence, equality, and  faith in socialism. Therefore, we will put an end to the  imperialists' domination and interference, and actively  contribute to man's common cause to defend, adhere to, and  advance the socialist cause. [applause]    Our working class and people who are resolutely fighting for  the just socialist cause by highly upholding the banner of the  chuche idea under the great party's refined leadership, will  always be victorious. [applause]    Let us all highly uphold the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song  and single-heartedly unite around the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il to all the more vigorously fight for the victorious  advance of socialism of our own style, the fatherland's  independent and peaceful reunification, and for man's bright  future. [applause]    Hurrah for Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader of our  party  and our people! [shouts of hurrahs and applause]    Hurrah for General Kim Chong-il, the respected and beloved  supreme commander, who is the great leader [yongdoja] of our  party and our people! [shouts of hurrahs and applause]    Hurrah for May Day, the international holiday in which it is  demonstrating the united might of the world's working class!  [applause]</p>

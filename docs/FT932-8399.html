			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Letter: Russia needs backing for targeted projects in addition to aid at macro-economic level Sir, Your leader of May 13 ('G7's Russian roulette'), rightly underlines the need for the western democracies to adopt a bolder and more imaginative approach to Russia's economic problems. Discussion has so far largely concentrated on the role western aid can play at the macro-economic level by encouraging tighter budget discipline and bringing inflation under some sort of control. These are of course essential objectives which are crucial to the success of the reform process. But Russia's economic miracle, unlike Germany's since the second world war, will not be achieved simply - or perhaps even primarily - by macro-economic policies, however well conceived and executed. Because of the physical and mental rigidities engendered by years of state control, macro-economic policy needs to be complemented by well directed and painstaking action at the micro-economic level. And since tighter budget discipline will have an adverse effect on most Russians' standard of living for some time, micro-economic aid should be targeted at projects which are directly relevant to everyday lives of ordinary citizens. Technical assistance of the kind supported by the British government's Know-How Fund has an important part to play in promoting beneficial changes at the micro-economic level. But something more is required if the long-suffering Russian people are to be given any hope of tangible improvements in their standard of living while the macro-economic policies do their work. I believe part of the new western aid package should take the form of soft loans, which would be repayable in foreign currency when the rouble becomes fully convertible and available for financing new capital projects in such fields as food processing and healthcare (two sectors where I have direct experience of current conditions in Russia). The financing of these projects - which could include such things as dairies, bakeries, hospitals and medical equipment factories - should be linked to the continuing provision of western technical assistance and management expertise. This approach would in my view meet an urgent human need and be of long-term benefit (both economic and political) to Russia and the donor countries. It would fit comfortably with the concept of a 'second Marshall fund' envisaged in your own leading article. Ronald McIntosh, 10 Westminster Palace Gardens, Artillery Row, London SW1P 1RL</p>

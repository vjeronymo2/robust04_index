			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Companies acquitted over Blue Arrow rights issue County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities - were acquitted yesterday of joining the alleged conspiracy to mislead the markets over the result of the employment agency's 1987 rights issue. Instructing the Old Bailey jury to acquit the companies, the judge, Mr Justice McKinnon, ruled that there was insufficient evidence for the cases against them to proceed any further. With five of their former employees still on trial, the companies issued only the briefest of statements following the acquittals. A National Westminster spokesman said that the parent bank was 'pleased' that its subsidiary companies had been acquitted. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew welcomed the judge's ruling but said no further comment could be made while the trial against the individual defendants continued. Mr Justice McKinnon said the companies' acquittals did not affect the cases against the remaining five individual defendants in any way. 'There are legal and separate evidential reasons concerning the companies and how they can be liable in respect of crime which have led me to my direction,' he told the jury. The five defendants now left in the trial are: Mr Jonathan Cohen, a former County chief executive; Mr David Reed, a former head of corporate finance at County; Mr Nicholas Wells, a former County corporate finance director; Mr Martin Gibbs, a former head of corporate finance at P&amp;D; and Mr Christopher Stainforth, a former P&amp;D director. Each individual defendant had had the authority of his employer to buy the shares taken by County and P&amp;D in the rights issue, the judge said. 'There is no suggestion that any one of the individual defendants was on a frolic of his own,' he added. The jury, which had not sat since mid-December, was recalled to return the not guilty verdicts. The judge told the jury he had reached his decision to acquit P&amp;D on December 19 last year and his decision regarding the two NatWest subsidiaries on January 17. Costs - estimated at several million pounds - were awarded in the companies' favour. The trial will resume on Tuesday when Mr Justice McKinnon will begin his summing up. He told the jury that in his summing up he would have particular things to say about Mr Stainforth. The trial, which started on February 11 last year, is one of the longest in criminal history. With estimates of its total cost exceeding Pounds 35m, it will be the most expensive. Defendants shake off blues, Page 6</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL NEWS: STUDENT LEARNS THE WAYS OF WASHINGTON  </P> <P> Nogales High School junior Gilbert Velasquez wants to be an aeronautical  engineer, not a congressman, but he recently got to see what it's like to make  decisions that influence the nation.  </P> <P> Velasquez of West Covina was one of about 225 high school students from around  the country who attended the six-day Congressional Youth Leadership Conference  in Washington last month.  </P> <P> The students met with members of Congress and their staffs, journalists, and  lobbyists. The high point of the conference was a mock Congress in which the  students debated, lobbied and voted on the proposed volunteer service  legislation.  </P> <P> "It was an opportunity of a lifetime, and it made you want to do more in public  service," Velasquez said.  </P> <P> Velasquez, 16, who is interested in golf, band and the science club at his  school, said he went to the conference mainly to see Washington but now wants  to be more involved.  </P> <P> Velasquez is taking his experience back to his school by starting a drive to  get more 18-year-olds to register to vote.  </P> <P> The conference is sponsored by the National Youth Leadership Council, a  nonprofit, nonpartisan group. The council sends high school juniors and seniors  to Washington every two weeks.  </P> <P> Oscar Cabrera, a senior at Claremont's Webb School, and Karissa Reese, a senior  at Imperial High School in Pasadena, attended conferences earlier this month.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Choe Won-ki: "How High Is the Pitch of </F> Crisis on the Korean Peninsula--the Government Intensifies  Alertness at the Front; Stock Market Plummeting; Weekend Traffic  Unaffected, Thus Showing Double Response"]    [Text] With the possibility of the adoption of a UN  resolution on sanctions against North Korea becoming a  certainty, the pitch of crisis on the Korean peninsula is  heightening.    The government undertook crisis-management steps on the  Korean peninsula, such as intensifying the alert posture at the  front, and this atmosphere is already reflected in inter-Korean  relations and the stock market.    President Kim Yong-sam, who is currently visiting Russia, is  the person who feels the pitch of crisis on the Korean peninsula  most sensitively.  <H5>  ROK-U.S. Hotline in Operation. </H5>   Judging that UN Security Council sanctions on the North are  a  certainty in the wake of International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA] Director General Hans Blix's 4 June report, President Kim  has instructed the cabinet to operate a crisis-managing system.    The instructions President Kim gave from Moscow intensified  the alert posture at the front; stabilizing public sentiment;  strengthening international alliance; and setting up strategy  for the UN Security Council.    Based on this, the government is operating the Unification  and Security Coordinating Committee chaired by Deputy Prime  Minister and Minister of the National Unification Board [NUB] Yi  Hong-ku and the working ad hoc committee led by NUB Vice  Minister Song Yong-tae. Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae has begun  checking ROK-U.S. combat readiness with U.S. Defense Secretary  Perry via a hotline.    The NUB says that North Korea has not shown any specific  signs of change in its moves.    However, once the resolution on sanctions against the North  is presented before the UN Security Council, North and South  Korea are sure to engage in a fierce propaganda offensive  against each other.  <H5>  The South Will Counter the North in a Full-Fledged Manner. </H5>   In this connection, the government issued a refuting  statement to the North on 5 June in the name of Yi Sung-kon,  chairman of the North-South Nuclear Control Committee.    In the statement, he criticized that "The statement dated 4  June by North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kang Sok-chu  threatening to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty  [NPT] was prompted by an extremely dangerous idea mocking at the  expectations of the international community and the entire  nation."    This deviates from the previous position of the government  avoiding directly countering North Korean challenges as best as  possible.    Concerning this change, a responsible government official  said, "We have taken this position anticipating that the North  and the South will exchange a fierce war of statements for a  couple of months to come when the UN Security Council's economic  sanctions against the North will become a reality."    The noteworthy moves North Korea has shown for the last  24 hours were the two contrasting reactions, one dovish and the  other hawkish, namely, the remark by Chu Chang-chun, North  Korean ambassador to China, that "North Korea will permit all  inspections if the third round of talks with the United States  are realized," and the statement of the Committee for the  Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland that "North Korea is  prepared for both dialogue and war.    The government regards Ambassador Chu's remark as an trial  balloon designed to test the political will of the ROK and the  United States.    In the meantime, the sense of crisis resulting from the UN  Security Council's discussion of sanctions is beginning to be  felt conspicuously in the civilian sector.    On 5 June, when there was news about the Security Council  pushing ahead with the resolution for sanctions against the  North, the composite stock market index plummeted by 12.17 point  to 930.26.    In view of the fact that the stock market index fell only  about nine points when North Korea mentioned the "sea of fire"  on 19 March, the stock market is considered to be watching the  crisis resulting from the moves for sanctions against the North  more seriously.    Meanwhile, a contrasting phenomenon is observed overseas.  The ROK's Korea Fund (KF) and the convertible bond (CB), which  temporarily fell in New York and London in March when North  Korea mentioned the "sea of fire, are maintaining a stable  market.    For instance, the Samsung Electronic Company's CB No. 2, the  ROK's typical blue-chip convertible bond, remains at the $22  level in the New York market despite the moves of the Security  Council.    However, the Korean people enjoyed the golden Memorial Day  weekend in the first week of June, going out to the Seoul-Pusan  and Yongdong highways in 187,500 cars--60 percent more than  ordinary weekends--thus revealing a double state of mind,  feeling no immediate crisis.    The experts, commenting on this phenomenon, say, "It is true  that the pitch of crisis is high on the Korean peninsula, but  the majority of the people must be feeling that the North Korean  nuclear issue will somehow find a clue to a solution through the  heightening of crisis."    A reliable research worker from the National Unification  Research Institute noted, "North Korea must be trying to  maximize the utility of the nuclear card by replacing fuel rods  on its own despite the fact that it could hold the third round  of talks with the United States only if it acceded to additional  inspections." He added, "There is a possibility of North  Korea's staging a surprise show when the crisis on the Korean  peninsula is at its peak in order to bring about a dramatic  reversal in the crisis."</p>

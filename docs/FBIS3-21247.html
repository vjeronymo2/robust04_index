			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Tokyo Electric Power Co.'s Kashiwazaki Kariba  Nuclear Power Plant (Kariba Village-Kashiwazaki City, Niigata  Prefecture) will have become the world's biggest and newest  nuclear power plant by July 1997 when its Reactor No. 7 begins  operations. At present, Boiling Water Reactors (BWR) Nos. 1,2,3  5 (1.1 million kW, each) are in operation. Under construction at  present are BWR No. 4 (1.1 million kW) and the advanced BWR  (ABWR) Nos. 6 and 7 (each 1.356 million kW). The combined output  of these 7 reactors, amounting to 8.212 million kW, is the  largest in the world.     <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-50A>           Kashiwazaki-Kariba Nuclear Power Plant Positional Diagram </FIG>       No matter where you look, here or abroad, it would be  difficult to find another power plant which is adding three more  nuclear reactors. Japan's Kashiwazaki-Kariba Nuclear Power  Plant, moreover, will become the world's first ABWR power plant.  The energy source development plays a central role in Japan's  energy policy. For a long time, the light water reactor is  expected to become the ``main stream.'' At the same time,  advancement of light water reactor technology is being pursued.  Kashiwazaki-Kariba Nuclear Power Plant, therefore, will become a  great nuclear power base satisfying those demands.    At Kashiwazaki-Kariba plant, Reactor No. 3 began operating  on  11 August 1993. The total output of the plant now equals to that  of Fukushima Second Nuclear Power Plant, viz., 4.4 million kW.  Moreover, at this point, Tokyo Electric Power's nuclear power  facilities, equipped with 14 reactors, are generating 13.4198  million kW. This output represents approximately 27% of  the  total power generation facilities.    Of the power generation facilities currently under  construction, Reactor No. 4, whose construction began in  February 1988, achieved an overall progress rate of 95.3%  at  the end of September 1993. The loading of fuels began on 7  October. Its commercial operations will begin in July 1994.    Reactors Nos. 3 and 4 are attracting attention as the  world's  first ABWR, an advanced version of BWR featuring improved  safety, reliability, operationality, and work ratio.  Construction of Reactor No. 6 began in September 1991 and that  of Reactor No. 7 in February 1992. Their progress rates at the  end of September are 48.3% and 20.8%,  respectively. For  Reactor No. 6, fitting of steel plate lining of a reactor  containment vessel made of reinforced concrete almost has been  completed. Its pressure vessel will be installed in September  1994. For Reactor No. 7, a base mat construction, which is a  basic construction on a base rock, will be completed some time  in October; a pressure vessel will be installed in June 1995.  Reactor No. 6 will start operating commercially in December  1996, and Reactor No. 7 in July 1997.    The foremost characteristic of ABWR is that a nuclear  reactor  recirculation pump, designed to circulate water within the  reactor, which has been installed outside the reactor pressure  vessel, will be replaced by the ``pressure vessel internal  pump.'' This has made it possible to reduce the number of pipes  arranged within a recirculation system. Consequently, in an  emergency situation, a reactor core will not be exposed;  moreover, since the sizes of reactor containment vessel and  reactor housing can be reduced, construction cost also can be  lowered.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-51A>           Graphic </FIG>       Furthermore, many next-generation technologies are employed  in constructing ABWR. For instance, use of an integral  construction in the reinforced concrete reactor containment  vessel and reactor housing increased their resistance to  vibration. Moreover, multiple functions equipped with, in  addition to hydraulic pressure drive, an electric motor drive  designed to work at slow pace as well, is used in a control rod  drive system.    Tokyo Electric Power ordered main power generation units  (nuclear reactor, turbine, and generator), constituting the  two-thirds of total construction costs of Reactor Nos. 6 and 7,  from the International Joint Venture (JV), a joint venture of  General Electric (GE), Toshiba, and Hitachi. Of these, the  amount of order received by GE is approximately one-third, or  approximately 1.4 billion dollars (approximately &yen;190  billion; each unit, approximately &yen;95 billion). Construction  of ABWR, therefore, contributes to reducing Japan's trade  surplus against the United States.  <H5>  In Process of Transforation into Software Base </H5>   Total construction cost of Reactors Nos. 1-7 reaches  &yen;2.6256 trillion. At the point when Reactor No. 7 will  become operational, Tokyo Electric Power's nuclear power  generation facilities will have had a total of 17 reactors,  generating 17.38 million kW all together. The total nuclear  power output will constitute 30.8% of the company's entire  power generation facilities, including hydraulic and thermal  power plants. This clearly indicates the importance of  Kashiwazaki-Kariba as a source of power. Its secondary effects  on Niigata Prefecture's economy, including its regional  development plan, also are spreading.    The amount of subsidy received under Three Laws concerning  Power Source Development is approximately &yen;76.1 billion. Of  this amount, Kashiwazaki City, the site of plant construction,  received approximately &yen;24.2 billion and Kariba,  approximately &yen;21.5 billion. At the end of August, the  number of those employed was 2,088 in Kashiwazaki City and 299  in Kariba. When these numbers are combined with those in other  regions of the prefecture, the total is 4,209.    The most noticeable change brought about by the construction  of the nuclear power plants at Kashiwazaki-Kariba most likely is  an increase in local population.    To begin with, Kashiwazaki City, considered the cradle of  the  petroleum industry, is the locality whose economy is deeply  rooted in energy. Even today, its production of natural gas,  with the annual output of 370 million km[.sup]3[/],  constitute approximately 17.3% of the national output.  However,  ``from 1955 to 1970, its source of revenues were depleted  because we did not have the key industry. With a large number of  people either leaving or seeking seasonal work elsewhere, the  problem of depopulation became accurate. We realized that we had  to take action.'' (Masasumi Nishikawa, Mayor of Kashiwazaki  City).    In fact, in 1969, at the time the city voted for the nuclear  power plant construction, the size of its population was no more  than 80,000. Today, thanks to the nuclear power plant, our city  is one of those cities whose population has reached the 90,000  mark. In the case of Kashiwazaki City, the adoption of the  policy to spend revenues generated by the Kashiwazaki-Kariba  project in developing human resources and employment  opportunities has paid off in the ``creation of a city with  charm.'' The regional development policy played a nucleus role  in this undertaking.    Kashiwazaki City, which has been successful in persuading  two  four-year universities to relocate to the city, currently is  devoting its effort in building a ``software base.'' In order to  vitalize the region through use of advanced information  technology, a ground for facility installation for use in  training of information personnel and in bringing the software  industry to the city has been prepared. What the city envisions  are to create jobs for young people and to establish the  information industry in the region. Guided by the ``concept of  high-vision community,'' the city is moving toward the creation  of a software base, integrating industrial and academic  endeavors centering around imaging information technology.    At that juncture, Kashiwazaki City, will emerge as an  information city as well, this being done while maintaining its  role as an energy supply base, which is founded on regional  development.  <H5>  Interview with Mr. Masasumi Nishikawa, Mayor of Kashiwazaki </H5>   NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: What is your opinion  concerning subsidies granted under Three Laws concerning power  source development?    Nishikawa: In the case of Kashiwazaki City, a  subsidy granted under Three Laws concerning power source  development will be terminated soon. So the game is over insofar  as we are concerned. My feeling about Three Laws is that there  should be more flexibility. I am mentioning this for the benefit  of those regions which will be involved in power development  projects. However, in reality, these restrictions do not have  severe crippling effects. Even if restrictions exist, delay in  organizing a foundation does not leave one without a menu of  work to choose from. We simplified the matter by thinking that  all we had to do under the circumstance was to concentrate on  the basics for the previous stage.    NIKKO KOGYO SHIMBUN: What about the fixed asset  tax?    Nishikawa: The most important thing insofar as  city finance is concerned is to secure a constant source of  revenues. As you know, Three Laws grants a subsidy whenever a  company undertakes the construction of a new reactor, but that  is as far as it goes. Afterward, we have to deal with  depreciation assets tax. However, the tax will go down as the  assets depreciate. Since it is not constant, the headache  associated with it is not uniquely Kashiwazaki but applicable to  all other cities, towns, and villages, as well, where part of  their lands are marked off for construction of nuclear power  plants. We don't believe that we should spend the entire amount  of subsidies received simply because it is made available to us.  We are, therefore, searching for ways in which the money can be  made useful to succeeding generations.    Fifteen years is the term of repayment of a loan on nuclear  power facilities, but the actual work continues much longer. Our  association with the nuclear power plant also will continue.  Since our source of revenues will dwindle over the years, while  stretching the depreciable assets, we should take a step to find  a new steady source of revenues--these are the things which we  wish to see achieved, although we do realize that legislating a  new taxation will be difficult.    NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: More specifically--    Nishikawa: At present, a nuclear fuel tax is  granted to the prefecture. Since this tax will be imposed on  fuel loading as long as nuclear power is at work, it is a  semi-permanent source of revenues. Especially in the case of  Kashiwazaki-Kariba, the tax amount involved when all seven  reactors become operative will be huge. In order to see that a  certain percentage of the tax will be allocated to regional  cities, towns, and villages, where part of lands are used for  constructing nuclear power plants, we will request not only  national guidelines but prefecture's actions as well. Moreover,  a preferential measure has a proviso stating ``limited to future  additions or new construction sites.'' This is contrary to  what the country said previously. We are urging the prefecture  not to forget the hard work put in by those connected with  earlier nuclear power plant construction sties.    NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Can you tell me something  about the disaster prevention measure from the local viewpoint?    Nishikawa: We want the national government to  provide guidelines which are a little more structured and  centralized. We like to see the Ministry of Home Affairs, MITI,  and Science and Technology Agency come together in dealing with  the problem of nuclear disaster prevention.    NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Can you talk on the  secondary effects of nuclear power plant on Kashiwazaki-Kariba  residents?    Nishikawa: At present, the plants employ 2,900  locals. These are stable jobs in terms of future as well. The  total amount invested was &yen;2.6 trillion. The fact that such  a huge amount of money was brought into our region certainly is  a big plus. For instance, in 1972, only 20% of our  high-school  graduates settled in Kashiwazaki. Today, this figure has risen  to over 50%. This is brought about not only by Tokyo  Electric  Power but also by the development of various facilities which,  in turn, can be attributed to power plants built in this region.  In the field of educational undertaking, we have been successful  to have two four-year universities relocate to this region.  Moreover, in 1990, the region was designated as a high-vision  community model region. Currently, our major effort goes into  developing software industry in which imaging plays a central  role.    NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Your picture of the future  of Kashiwazaki and nuclear power?    Nishikawa: Currently, we are developing three  reactors. Kashiwazaki and Tokyo Electric Power are like a  married couple raising children. The construction work give us a  feeling of climbing a hill, which we rather enjoy. However, once  our role in child rearing is finished, we believe that there  will be a stringent demand--unlike any we thus far have  experienced--placed on both sides. How does Tokyo Electric Power  feel about being in this region ten, twenty years from now? Do  they find it meaningful? I am not talking about money or  material things. We want to make serious effort in thinking out  this type of problem. I hope that the company will do the same.  <H5>  BTC Niigata Center </H5>   An operator training firm for BWR Nuclear Power Plant, the  BWR Operation Training Center (BTC, 651 Fuzawa Aza Chuodai,  Okuma-machi, Futaba-gun, Fukushima Prefecture. President: Mr.  Yuhiro Mizuno), invested a total of &yen;5 billion to construct  the second training base, ``BTR Niigata Center,'' (a building  area: 5,600m[.sup]2[/]) in Kariba Village. Training already  has begun at the center.    Six companies which are using BWR consists of [Japan Nuclear  Power Generation Co.], and Tohoku, Tokyo, Chubu, Hokuriku, and  Chugoku Electric Power Companies. The BTC Niigata Center will  deal with the need for improved operational safety and stability  created by the addition of nuclear power facility sites on the  Japan Sea Coast, such as Kashiwazaki-Kariba.    The center's main facility consist of a 1.1 million kW class  simulation model of Reactor No. 4 used in operational training,  viz., Simulator No. 4, and computer-assisted instruction (CAI)  units. The center can train two 4-member teams a day. The  simulator is an exact model of the power plant's central control  panel. Training with the simulator provides trainees with the  feeling of working with the actual equipment. In addition to  routine plant operations, such as start and stop, through use of  hypothetical accidents, training in handling of emergency  situations can be repeated as frequently as required.    The center will install an ABWR operational training  simulator in the summer of 1994. With this installed facility,  the center looks ahead to the need which must be filled when  Reactors Nos. 6 and 7 begin operating. Before the actual  equipment becomes operative, therefore, the center wants to see  that it has well-trained ABWR operators ready to go when the  time comes.</p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (1): Authority set patterns for the future - The ECSC / Alan Millward discovers a book of great relevance in the story of the EU The History of the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community. Supranationality in Operation by Dirk Spierenburg and Raymond Poidevin Weidenfeld and Nicolson, Pounds 70 720 pages The nine members of the High Authority of the European Coal, Iron and Steel Community (ECSC) first met in 1952 in remote Luxembourg City. The site was provisional and the governments never agreed where it should be permanently located. The members were mostly unknown even in their own countries. Yet in the bible of European unity this has become Genesis. Their president, Jean Monnet, had become the prophet of European union and they had each sworn an oath to administer the Community independently of all influence from their national governments. How well they did so is the subject of this officially supported study by the European Commission written by a respected French diplomatic historian and a Dutch official who was the youngest and probably the most able member of the High Authority. The High Authority's work set the later form for Brussels. It was to administer the letter of a treaty, in this case the 1952 Treaty of Paris, and a Court of Justice was to interpret each article to make sure it did this and no more. A Council of Ministers was intended to keep all important decisions in the hands of national governments. A parliament had little to do. And Monnet within two months had established one of the guiding principles of the future Euro-bureaucracy: it should be overpaid. The less it had to do, the more it grew. By the early 1960s, when all power had moved to Brussels, it had expanded to more than 1,000 people. The US, which wanted European unity, allowed the High Authority the same pomp and circumstance as a national government when its members visited Washington. There was even an American loan. But where it mattered, in Paris and in Bonn, these supposedly independent men had to consult at every turn and - usually after token dissent - to obey. The High Authority was one point in a triangle of power of which the other two were business and government. The Treaty, like government at the time, was interventionist. International control over the German steel industry was central to the Allies' settlement with the German Federal Republic. Expansion of the steel industry was deemed too important to to be left in private hands. In Britain and France coal was nationalised. To manage a common market in those circumstances could only mean regulating the market in an equitable compromise of national interests. Results were mixed. Tariffs on coal and most steel products went at the start of 1953. Through railway freight rates, instead of the previous discriminatory charges by national railway systems, came soon afterwards. The price of this triumphant public symbolism was: carefully regulated, although standardised, steel prices; the survival of regional pricing for coal; massive subsidisation of Belgium's moribund coalfields; exclusion from the regulated market for Italy's developing steel industry - tiny but helped by this to become a future giant; the management of the equalisation fund for steel scrap; and the resigned acceptance of the cartels which, according to the language of the Treaty, the High Authority was supposed to eliminate. The Ruhr coal producers' sales cartel survived untroubled. France aided and abetted this, so that it could maintain its own national coal importing cartel. The German steel firms, broken up into smaller units by the Western Allies as a departing present to the Community, reassembled themselves at the low cost of answering a few legal questions from Luxembourg. The steel export cartel proclaimed itself before the Treaty was ratified and shouldered the High Authority aside. In 1958, when the bottom dropped out of the coal market, the High Authority fell into impotence as Germans tried to keep up prices to save their coal mines and Dutch and Italians grabbed at cheap US coal. Who could regulate an energy market by only having the powers to regulate coal? For the builders of the new Europe this disaster did not matter; the Treaty of Rome had been ratified and a common market of an altogether grander scope was on its way. On balance the High Authority did not do so badly. Where it concentrated on doing what all national governments were doing at the same time, improving social provision, it was allowed almost a free hand and left behind an honourable record of better housing for workers, retraining schemes, re-adaptation grants for unemployed and displaced miners and the beginnings of a system of easier international labour mobility in western Europe. This is the book to read for those who really want to know about the EU, even though it tells only of its childhood. No child was more necessary. But no child was more father to the man, and like most histories of childhood this is one of unrealistic and thwarted ambitions, lamentable moral compromises and excessive parental control.</p>

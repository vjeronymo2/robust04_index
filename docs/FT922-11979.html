			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Company News: 3M optimistic in spite of 3.9% decline to Dollars 288m MINNESOTA Mining &amp; Manufacturing, the US conglomerate based in St Paul, Minnesota and known as 3M, reported a decline of 3.9 per cent in its first-quarter net income. The group recorded income of Dollars 288m, or Dollars 1.32 per share, down from Dollars 300m, or Dollars 1.37 per share, last year, but the company was optimistic that it would be able to improve results during the remainder of the year. First-quarter sales edged up to Dollars 3.4bn from Dollars 3.38bn for the same period a year ago. The higher value of the US dollar reduced sales by about 2 per cent and net income by about Dollars 15m, or 7 cents per share. However, Mr L. D. DeSimone, chairman, said that the results were in line with the company's expectations for the first quarter. The group's international business, which accounts for about half its sales, remained firm as steady growth in Europe and strong gains in Latin America offset a slowdown in Japan. International volume by unit increased 6 per cent, a level equal to the growth averaged for all of 1991. Sales in the US remained basically unchanged, but the company noted that unit sales improved as the quarter progressed. This, and more solid volume gains in the early days of the second quarter, led the company to believe that the US economy would continue to show some moderate improvement. Mr DeSimone said the outlook for the full year was positive and he expected higher second-quarter earnings, in spite of the fact that the effects of currency translation would remain negative. In the second quarter last year, the company earned Dollars 299m, or Dollars 1.36 a share, on sales of Dollars 3.35bn.</p>

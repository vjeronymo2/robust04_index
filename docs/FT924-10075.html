			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Tarnished gilts The composure shown by the gilts market since Black Wednesday's devaluation seems finally to be cracking after yesterday's fall of more than a point at the long end. The most obvious concern is the Autumn spending round, which has set the market worrying about drift in fiscal as well as monetary policy. Tomorrow's parliamentary vote on the Maastricht Treaty may, however, ultimately prove to be more important. Funding a PSBR which, on some estimates, could approach Pounds 50bn next year is certainly a daunting task. It would be rash to assume the authorities' only strategy is to allow gilt prices and the exchange rate to fall far enough to attract foreign buyers back into the market. When sterling was floating before, overseas investors bought gilts when they thought the currency was cheap, but they did not necessarily hold on to them. That suggests the need for substantial domestic support will continue. Indeed the authorities might eventually be forced to relent on their refusal to allow bank and building society purchases of gilts to count as funding. The chancellor would have been foolish to play into the hands of spending ministers by announcing this in last week's Mansion House speech while budget discussions were still going on. As for foreign investors, they would be more likely to buy and hold gilts if they perceived a period of currency stability ahead. Perhaps sterling will tend to rise against the D-Mark next year in the backwash of a higher dollar and lower German interest rates. Foreign appetite for gilts would be greater, though, if the market had by then started to believe sterling might eventually rejoin the ERM. The credibility of that expectation has less to do with the absolute level of sterling than with the government's ability to overcome its internal divisions over Europe.</p>

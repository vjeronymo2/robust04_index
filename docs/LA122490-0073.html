			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. GEAR TOPS FORBES' PROFITABILITY RANKINGS;  </P> <P> EARNINGS: THE ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR MAKER HAS HAD AN AVERAGE RETURN ON EQUITY OF  83.2% THE PAST FOUR YEARS, THE MAGAZINE SAYS.  </P> <P> Athletic footwear maker L.A. Gear enjoyed the best long-term profitability of  nearly 1,200 U.S. corporations surveyed by Forbes magazine, the magazine  announced Sunday.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles-based company has averaged an 83.2% return on equity -- primary  earnings per share divided by common shareholders' equity per share -- in the  past four years, according to Forbes' calculations. In the last 12 months, the  company's profitability performance has slipped a bit. Its return on equity was  27.8% during that period, the magazine said.  </P> <P> St. Louis-based Pulitzer Publishing ranked second in profitability with an  80.6% average return on equity the past five years. Atlanta-based chemical  maker Georgia Gulf was third with 78.4% the past four years.  </P> <P> Forbes evaluated the profitability of 1,177 companies in 20 industries for its  Jan. 7, 1991, annual report issue.  </P> <P> Software maker Microsoft Corp., based in Redmond, Wash., was the most  profitable large corporation. Microsoft had an average return on investment of  50.4% the past five years, which landed it in 16th place on the general list.  </P> <P> To be considered among the largest companies, a firm had to have sales of more  than $1 billion and a minimum five-year average return on equity of 22%.  </P> <P> The median company in Forbes' survey had a five-year average return on  investment of 14.6%, up from 14.3% in 1989. The firms' return on investment for  the latest 12 months dropped, however, from 14.4% to 12.1%.  </P> <P> Leading Forbes' list of best-performing stocks was Blockbuster Entertainment.  The Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based video rental company had a five-year average  stock price increase of 3,060.5%. A total of 1,078 stocks were surveyed.  </P> <P> Cyprus Minerals, an Englewood, Colo.-based oil, gas and coal company, had the  highest rate of earnings-per-share growth -- a three-year average of 147.8%.  </P> <P> Forbes considers companies with annual revenue of $400 million -- or $600  million for banks or electric utilities -- for its annual report issue.  </P> <P> The only exception is biotechnology, a relatively new industry with a long lead  time between research and development and actual products.  </P> <P> The magazine based most of its rankings on five-year averages, although there  were some exceptions.  </P></p>

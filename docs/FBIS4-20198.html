			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "CIS Disarmament: With Bonn's Money </F> and High Technology"]    [Text] With German "know-how" and 20 million German marks  [DM] (for 1993-94) for the time being, the FRG Government wants  to accelerate the abolition of chemical and nuclear means of  mass destruction in Russia and Ukraine. At the moment, the  Russians can destroy only about 2,000 nuclear warheads per year.  On the territory of the former Soviet Union there are 30,000  nuclear warheads and, in Russia alone, 40,000 tonnes of chemical  weapons. It would take 15 to 20 years to destroy these stocks.    An internal paper of the Foreign Ministry says that, in  October 1993, an agreement was concluded with the Defense  Ministry in Moscow on the construction of a pilot plant for the  destruction of the chemical combat agents, lewisite and yperite,  in the area of Saratov (final price DM62 million). A mobile  laboratory for the analysis of combat agents was handed over to  the Russians already in December 1993. The costs for the  "disarmament aid for chemical weapons" in 1993: about DM5  million. For the accelerated disarmament of their nuclear  weapons Russia and Ukraine have asked the Federal Government  this year for equipment as well as control and safety systems at  a value of about DM17 million.</p>

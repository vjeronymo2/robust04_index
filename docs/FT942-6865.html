			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee futures sell-off extended to Dollars 400 a tonne The coffee market kept up its recent sell-off yesterday as prices for the July futures contract at the London Commodity Exchange plunged by Dollars 175 to Dollars 2,032 a tonne. Prices had recovered slightly from a Dollars 200 drop at one stage in the day, but with hedge funds bailing out of the market, the price could fall further. It has slipped by over Dollars 400 in the past two days. The presence of large financial investors and speculators in the coffee market has exaggerated the dramatic increase in prices over the past couple of months and this could now work in reverse with prices slipping quickly. However, the coffee market remains well above its February level of Dollars 1,200 a tonne and traders do not believe it will give up all of its gains as supplies are still tight. 'It's a healthy correction to what had become an overheated market,' one trader commented. Some analysts do not rule out a return to higher prices once the market draws breath. Coffee stocks remain low, they point out. Fresh coffee supplies are taking a long time to get on to the market with roasters holding on to stocks and new coffee deliveries being held back in anticipation of higher prices. Traders reported some disruption to the new Indonesian crop reaching the market. The cocoa market was affected by the fall-out from coffee and the July futures price dropped by another Pounds 14 to 1,010 a tonne.</p>

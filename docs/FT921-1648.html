			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Coupon conflict in food stores A FULL-SCALE price war may not yet have broken out in the UK grocery sector  -but a fierce coupon conflict certainly has. In the last few days the Leeds-based Asda chain has raised the tempo by launching a spoiling campaign designed to undermine their rivals' promotions. The saga started last year when Tesco announced amid controversy that it would redeem all other retailers' coupons. So, for example, if a competitor ran a promotion campaign in local newspapers and magazines offering 20p off its washing powder, then Tesco promised to give an equivalent discount on one of its products once the shopper had produced a rival's coupon. The move was criticised by Tesco's competitors and some food manufacturers which argued that it detracted from their marketing initiative and confused shoppers. But, as the complaints subsided, some of Tesco's rivals such as J. Sainsbury and the co-opera-tive societies followed the move. Asda has now called their bluff by targeting two areas of the country where it does not have any stores, dropping leaflets through letter-boxes offering Pounds 10 off every Pounds 20 spent at one of its stores. Asda said: 'The obvious intention was that somebody else would redeem them. This is a slightly tongue-in-cheek gesture, but our competitors seem to be taking it very seriously.'</p>

According to Interfax, he declared this at a news  conference today. He said that in Russia there are not 40,000  tonnes of toxic substances, as officially stated, but possibly a  whole order of magnitude more.    Apart from Aleksey Yablokov, the news conference was also  attended by Lev Fedorov, a doctor of chemical sciences and  co-author of the scientist Vil Mirzoyanov, who published the  well-known article Poisoned Politics [Otravlennaya politika].</p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Survey of Enterprise in Wales (9): New life in the valleys - Roland Adburgham reports on the partnership approach The Victorian edifice, inscribed 'Messrs Nixons' Workmen's Institute, Library &amp; Public Hall', has seen better days. The building, in Mountain Ash, Mid-Glamorgan, is derelict and its once-handsome yellow and red brick frontage is sprouting weeds. Mountain Ash is in Cynon Valley, in the heart of Mid Glamorgan and at the heart of attempts to revitalise the south Wales valleys. Once there were 50 collieries in Cynon Valley alone and there was a population of 100,000. Today, the population is 67,000 and male unemployment is about 30 per cent. This year, British Coal stopped production at Tower, its last deep mine in south Wales, at the northern end of the valley. Nixons typifies the challenge: it ran one of the collieries near Mountain Ash. Though the pit closed more than 40 years ago, its black scars remained until recently. Today, the memory of Nixons is being consigned to the past: on the pit's reclaimed land, there is the Cwm Cynon business centre. This flagship centre, opened last year on a 60-acre development site and now fully let, symbolises the efforts being made to revitalise the south Wales valleys. It is one result of a joint venture, launched in 1991, of the borough council, county council and Welsh Development Agency. In the wake of the Tower closure, the WDA investment in the venture has been increased to Pounds 28m over the next two years. As elsewhere in the valleys, a partnership approach is seen as the best means of co-ordinating measures to repair the damage to the environment, regenerate the towns and lever in private capital to create jobs. At Merthyr Tydfil, for example, a joint venture includes the borough council, Mid Glamorgan county council and WDA in association with Merthyr Business Forum. To encourage the growth of local companies, a business centre was opened last November. The partnership has come up with a scheme to develop five key sites which would be linked with each other and the town centre by monorail, to help counter the drift away of retail spending. In Gwent, the Victoria Partnership - formed by the WDA, Blaenau Gwent council and the county council - is transforming 80 acres of the Ebbw Vale garden festival into an urban village and, it is hoped, eventually local employment for 1,100 people. Many of the festival features are being retained, including the wetlands and woodland areas. 'We are still getting 100,000 visitors a year and the reaction has been excellent - that they have not returned to find a derelict site,' says Mr Alan Nicoll, of the WDA and head of the partnership. The target year for completion is 2000 and all 50 of the houses in the first phase have sold. Redrow Homes is the lead developer for the second phase of the village centre, which will have about 200 houses. 'The scheme is now seen by people as a success, and people want to jump on the back of success,' Mr Nicoll says. Also in Gwent is Tredegar Action, a partnership of the WDA, Blaenau Gwent borough council and county council, which involves a Pounds 3m refurbishment of the shopping centre by TBI, the Welsh-based property developer. In another town regeneration scheme, the Land Authority for Wales has signed a Pounds 20m contract with Boots Properties to transform the shopping centre of Caerphilly in the southern part of Rhymney Valley. It took seven years for the authority, which assembles difficult sites for development, to unravel the complex land ownerships. Mr Ian MacVicar, Rhymney Valley's economic development officer, says: 'What we are finding is that the valleys as a whole are now regarded as a place where industry can prosper. The old problems of poor transport and the legacy of the industrial revolution are largely things of the past.' Visitors to the valleys cannot but be unaware of the land reclamation, urban renewal and road improvements (the Welsh Office is giving a high priority to the dualling of the A465 Heads of the Valleys road, which will speed links with the English Midlands.) The need is obvious - a decayed environment is only a mask hiding deeper economic and social problems. The woe-begone appearance of Mountain Ash is not untypical. Old-fashioned shops, with such names as Plain &amp; Fancy, Home Comforts and Rita's Fashions, are next to estate agencies offering terraced cottages for as little as Pounds 20,000. Though the valley's employers include Hitachi, AB Electronics, Pirelli and Gooding Sanken, 42 per cent of the workforce are employed elsewhere. To widen the industrial base, the Cynon Valley partnership hopes to attract 25 new businesses by 1998, and to set up 200 local businesses. Last year, a technology training centre was opened with over 300 places. At the southern end of the valley and close to the M4, Navigation Park, a 15-acre business site, is being developed. Other money is going on land reclamation, tree planting, refurbishing the housing stock and improving the valley's principal town, Aberdare (where Grant Thornton, the accountancy firm, has been asked to investigate a controversial land deal). 'We're keen to improve the built environment quickly as quality sells,' says Mr Andrew Dakin, the WDA project director. 'We are taking a holistic view on regeneration - it's not just factory building or jobs  - it's everything nowadays.' Mr Chris Burns, the council's economic development officer, is realistic. 'The jury is out on us until we start to deliver the jobs. If we don't, then we have failed.' But there is confidence that the partnership is doing the spadework. Mr Dakin remarks: 'In the property world some of the key players are starting to be aware of the existence of Cynon Valley - before, no one knew.' Mr Tony Roberts, the borough council's chief executive, points to the kudos of the Royal Opera House siting its Pounds 4m scenery store near Aberdare. 'They trawled the UK for a site,' he says. 'We're very competitive on grants and land prices and I think others will follow. We have the locations, communications, available land and factories, and labour. We have all the pieces of the jigsaw. We are now able to compete in the marketplace.'</p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Sunday trading case decision AN industrial tribunal in Hull yesterday awarded former shop assistant Mrs Ruth Taylor Pounds 324 for unfair dismissal, but ruled she had not lost her job for refusing an order to work on Sunday. The decision is a setback for those campaigning against Sunday opening, who regarded Mrs Taylor's dismissal appeal as a test case over Sunday working. Mrs Taylor, a devout Baptist, claimed she had been fired unfairly by her employer, Franlow, a clothing store, because she would not work on Sunday for religious reasons when the company began Sunday trading last May. The tribunal chairman said Mrs Taylor had been fired on July 5 last year, two days after rejecting a request to work on Sunday after a 'long-running dispute' with a manageress at the store. He said her dismissal had been 'an instant decision' owing to a 'personality clash'. Mr Garfield Davies, general secretary of the Usdaw shop workers' union, said that the tribunal decision was a 'disappointment' because it had avoided giving a judgment on the Sunday working issue.</p>

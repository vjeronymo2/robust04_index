Under the Chinese constitution, all mineral resources belong  to the State.    The fee will be levied on all 9,000 State and 250,000  collective mining enterprises as well as foreign-funded and  private mining operators.    Each mining business will have to pay an average of less  than  4 percent of its sales income from mineral products as a fee.    Such a ratio, far lower than royalties abroad, treat foreign  investors the same as domestic firms, according to Fu Mingke,  deputy head of Mineral Development Management Bureau.    The bulk of the levy will be channelled to geological  surveys  and exploration work that are now stymied by a severe lack of  investment, said a senior official with the Ministry of Geology  and Mineral Resources.    The remainder will flow into general State revenue.    About 2-3 billion yuan ($230-344 million) a year is expected  to be raised from the levy.    The State Council is reviewing detailed rules on the levy  presented by the ministry, said Fu.    "The levy measures will come into force in the first half of  this year," Fu said. He did not give a specific date.    The levy is aimed to help develop the State's economic  resources.    The government's annual spending on geological surveys and  exploration work is about 8 billion yuan ($919 million), far  below what is needed to detect new mineral deposits and  guarantee stable mining production.    In China, about 95 per cent of the energy and 80 percent of  industrial raw materials come from non-renewable mineral  resources.    The rules favour those with a higher mining recovery rate.  They will be charged less to inspire more efficient and  rational mining development.    Presently, enterprises and individuals which exploit  minerals  only pay small part of their income in resource tax. Many  enterprises and individuals exploit mineral resources with  inefficient mining practices or methods which damage the  environment. This causes severe waste and loss of precious  resources.    "The new measures are in line with the international norms,"  Fu said adding that almost all foreign countries charge mining  firms a royalty.    The ministry prepared a draft of the rules in 1987, but met  strong protest from mining firms allegedly unable to bear the  financial burden owing to low State prices or mineral products.    "The time is ripe now. China's market economy has freed up  the price of most minerals, including oil, coal and iron," Fu  said.    Another consideration is that overseas investors involved in  Chinese mines -- once an area forbidden to them -- should be  charged with the fee.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Valeriy Manilov, deputy secretary of the </F> Russian Federation Security Council, by Aleksandr Pelts; place  and date not given: "Valeriy Manilov: Russia's Well-Being Is  the Supreme Criterion"]    [Text] From the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA files: Lieutenant General  Valeriy Leonidovich Manilov is a candidate of philosophical  sciences. He was born in 1939 in a serviceman's family. He  served in the Odessa and Transbaykal Military Districts and with  the Southern Group of Forces. He took part in military  operations in Afghanistan. He is a graduate of the General  Staff Military Academy. He headed the USSR Ministry of Defense  Information Directorate and the CIS Joint Armed Forces  Information Service. At present he is deputy secretary of the  Russian Federation Security Council.    [Pelts] Valeriy Leonidovich, the Security Council's  functions are so extensive that at times it is compared with the  former [CPSU Central Committee] Politburo. How objective is  this comparison?    [Manilov] I have heard of such comparisons. But let me  remind you of an old truism: All comparisons are  unsatisfactory. The Security Council's powers and functions are  indeed extensive, but it is fundamentally different from the  aforementioned structure. It is a constitutional organ, formed  and headed by the country's president. Furthermore, it does not  exercise any executive-administrative functions. Its main task  is to prepare presidential decisions in the sphere of ensuring  security. It considers and resolves strategic problems  associated with domestic, foreign, and military policy in this  sphere, defines Russia's national interests and the basic  guidelines for their protection, and performs a series of other  tasks.    [Pelts] Does the Security Council perform any coordinating  and monitoring functions?    [Manilov] Of course. The Security Council coordinates the  activity of organs of state power in the process of implementing  their own decisions and the edicts and directives of the Russian  Federation president as regards ensuring security. I would like  to emphasize that it coordinates in terms of objectives rather  than of functions, in other words without interfering in the  day-to-day activity of ministries and departments. As for  monitoring, it extends to the implementation of Security Council  decisions and of the president's edicts on security questions.  The Security Council's secretary and apparatus have been given  powers to organize inspections of the efficiency of the  implementation of these decisions by ministries and departments.    [Pelts] How, in your view, could one define the Security  Council's position and role in our society?    [Manilov] It is an organ ensuring the exercise of the  Russian president's functions as regards running the state in  the security sphere. Hence its position in the state hierarchy.  The paramount task of the Security Council is to preserve  Russia's state sovereignty, maintain sociopolitical stability in  society, and defend citizens' rights and freedoms. This is in  line with the vital interests of all Russians, regardless of  their social status and party-political orientation. Hence the  Security Council's essentially consolidating role in our society.    [Pelts] Is this role manifest in some specific way in the  work of the Security Council itself and of its apparatus?    [Manilov] Of course, and quite graphically at that. The  Security Council synthesizes the intellect, will, and experience  of people, each one of whom plays a key role in his own field as  regards the implementation and protection of Russia's  national-state interests. Look no further than the Security  Council's composition. This synthesis actually produces a  statewide policy. Since Russia's interests and its well-being  are the supreme criterion of the Security Council's work, there  is no room for any departmental or group interests in the  practical activity of its apparatus. This is our creed. Let me  note with gratification that this creed is essentially shared by  all with whom we work in the closest possible business contacts.    [Pelts] And who are they, if it is no secret?    [Manilov] They make up a very broad circle. The service of  aides, the main structures of the president's staff, the  committees and commissions of the Federal Assembly chambers, the  government apparatus, representatives of ministries and  departments and primarily of those headed by Security Council  members, scientific research organizations, and public  associations.    [Pelts] How do you ensure the objectivity of information  supplied to the president and other Council members?    [Manilov] This is indeed a very important aspect. The sole  correct decision can be adopted only on the basis of  comprehensive analysis of the fullest and best possible  information. The mechanism used here is simultaneously simple  and complex. Under the law we have the right to co-opt any  state structure capable of acquiring. accumulating, and  analyzing information, as well as the information and analysis  organs of all "power" departments, state and scientific centers,  and nongovernmental organizations. Briefly, whenever necessary  we can call on the entire information and analysis potential  available in the country in the process of preparing proposals,  recommendations, and decisions on security questions.    [Pelts] Who determines the questions to be discussed at  Security Council sittings?    [Manilov] We use the following method. The Security Council  secretary submits proposals, taking into account the opinions of  Security Council members. They are considered and approved by  the president.    [Pelts] There is obviously a plan for the Security Council's  work.    [Manilov] Yes. Naturally. But life frequently introduces  its own amendments. There are occasions when an apparently  routine question turns into a most acute problem demanding  solution at the highest level. At other times, when a scheduled  question is being discussed at a Security Council sitting, it  emerges that other equally important questions arise from it....    [Pelts] And how do you manage to keep this mass of problems  under control?    [Manilov] Primarily by setting priorities. You cannot  embrace the boundless, as Kozma Prutkov said. And he was right.  The important point is to single out the main ones from among  the broadest spectrum of problems and concentrate efforts on  their solution. A major role in this selection process is  played by the system of interdepartmental commissions which are  the Security Council's basic working organs. This system also  includes the Scientific Council recently set up under the  Security Council, which provides scientific backup for the  decisions, recommendations, and forecasts being prepared. This  system makes it possible to "stick to" the general avenues of  ensuring security while retaining room for maneuver. The  commissions are headed by senior officials appointed by the  Russian Federation president. They are, as a rule, ministers or  first deputy ministers. The commissions coordinate  horizontally, as it were, the interests and positions of  ministries and departments.    [Pelts] Judging by the scale of the tasks being solved, the  Security Council apparatus must be quite sizeable?    [Manilov] The apparatus employs, in addition to technical  personnel, just over 100 people. They are mainly highly skilled  professionals capable of effectively performing tasks in the  interests of ensuring Russia's security at all levels.    [Pelts] Security at all levels.... How many such levels are  there?    [Manilov] Three in principle: the security of individuals,  the security of society, and the security of the state. They  are, of course, inseparable, interlinked, and interconnected.  And they are all matters of priority. Nonetheless, the  security of the individual is the starting point.  Unfortunately, uncertainty is a typical feature of our life  today. Many people are losing sight of their reference points.  This is frightening. It is, therefore, vitally important to  ensure that everyone knows and actually senses that society and  the state are concerned about his interests and security.    [Pelts] But in order to achieve this, it is probably  necessary to resolve certain specific questions?    [Manilov] You are right. Lev Tolstoy remarked that it is  easy to love the whole world, but just try and love some  specific person.... There is a multitude of specific questions,  including some which, at first glance, do not appear to concern  statewide interests but are tackled by the Security Council  apparatus as part of its work. From this viewpoint, the  questions raised at Security Council sittings are just the  visible tip of the iceberg.    [Pelts] The Security Council's composition has been changed  on several occasions in the recent past. What is this -- a sign  of a quest for a "better team?"    [Manilov] I think that this formulation of the question is  incorrect. Presidential edicts have effected certain changes in  the Security Council's composition -- this is correct. They  have been prompted by life. Gaydar, Fedorov, and Golushko have  departed. Stepashin, Shoygu, and Nikolayev have joined the  Security Council. In my view, the president's decisions on  their appointments need no comment. These people represent the  most important avenues for ensuring Russia's national security.  Federal Assembly chamber leaders Shumeyko and Rybkin recently  became members of the Security Council. This is in line with  the letter and spirit of the Treaty on Social Accord, with the  nationwide and statewide nature and scale of responsibility for  the fatherland's security.    [Pelts] Valeriy Leonidovich, the question "On the Concept of  Russia's National Security" ranks last in the Security Council's  work plan. Why is this? Is it possible to speak of ensuring  security if there is no concept of it?    [Manilov] The important point is to ensure rather than to  talk about ensuring. And this should be done now, today, not  tomorrow or the day after. Therefore, the elaboration of the  concept is progressing in parallel with the creation of a  security system and the mechanisms ensuring its effective  operation. Certain fragments of the general concept have already  been elaborated and adopted by the Security Council -- those  concerning the foreign policy and defense spheres. Others are  being elaborated simultaneously with the general concept.  Bearing this in mind, it has been planned to consider it at a  Security Council sitting toward year's end. The main point is  that this work is being done within the framework of a unified  scheme whose core is to guarantee the ensuring of the protection  of Russia's national-state interests.</p>

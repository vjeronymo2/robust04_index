			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> SURVEY SAYS DRUG PROGRAMS NEEDED  </P> <P> More facilities are needed to treat chemically addicted pregnant women, adults  and youths in the county, according to an informal survey of area residents  conducted by the Ventura County Health Care Agency.  </P> <P> In a series of forums held since February throughout the county, residents said  that gaps in county services force many addicted adults and youths to fend for  themselves, said Stephen Kaplan, Health Care Agency administrator of Alcohol  and Drug Programs.  </P> <P> While county officials are unsure of the actual number of residents who need  drug and alcohol recovery services, it is clear that many simply aren't getting  the help they need, Kaplan said.  </P> <P> "Currently, if you are a male in this county with no or limited medical  insurance and you want to get into a residential recovery unit, you're  basically out of luck," Kaplan said.  </P> <P> Women under the age of 18 who want to recover from drug or alcohol addiction  have access to a six-bed facility in Ventura, but a similar county-run  residential program for males does not exist, Kaplan said.  </P> <P> Several area hospitals offer residential treatment programs, "but they are out  of reach of anybody who has a limited income and no medical insurance," Kaplan  said.  </P> <P> Aside from increasing the number of treatment facilities, residents have also  called for more programs to prevent troubled youth from becoming addicted to  alcohol and drugs and better outreach to the Spanish-speaking community, Kaplan  said.  </P> <P> Forums are scheduled at 7 p.m. Wednesday at the Simi Valley Library, 2969 Tapo  Canyon Road; the Oxnard Community Center, 200 E. Bard Road, on May 23 and the  East Valley Area Sheriff's Station, 2101 E. Olsen Road, Thousand Oaks, on June  13. CAROLYN KUSKY  </P></p>

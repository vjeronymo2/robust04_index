			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 29 KYODO -- The House of  Representatives on Saturday [29 January] approved the ruling  coalition's political reform package whose key phases are set to  be revised at the regular Diet session slated to convene on  Monday. The two-tier arrangement on parliamentary proceedings  was hammered out at an eleventh-hour, horse-trading session  between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Liberal Democratic  Party President Yohei Kono from Friday night to early Saturday.    The powerful lower chamber of Japan's two-chamber Diet gave  its blessing to the legislation by a stand-up vote.    The seven parties of the ruling coalition and the main  opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) endorsed the  compromise. The opposition Japanese Communist Party voted  against the package.    The legislation is almost certain to clear a subsequent  House  of Councillors session later in the day, the final day of the  current extraordinary Diet session.    A date for implementation of the legislation was deleted  from  the government's original bills in line with the agreement  between Hosokawa and Kono. The timing of the enforcement of the  new law will be finalized through debate at the onset of the  regular Diet session.    Earlier in the day, the joint committee of both houses of  the  Diet approved the compromise over political reform reached  between Hosokawa and Kono.    The 20-legislator joint committee was set up after the upper  house voted down the package on January 21, forcing the ruling  coalition to mount desperate efforts to salvage the bills. The  reform package passed the lower house on November 18.    After talks at the panel deadlocked, the stalemate was  finally broken in top-level negotiations between Hosokawa and  Kono.</p>

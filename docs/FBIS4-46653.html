L. Lidov, N. M. Teslenko, Institute of </F> Applied Mathematics, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow; UDC  521.1;523.44]    [Abstract] Most gravitational maneuvers have involved the  planets rather than the Moon, although as far back as 1959 the  unmanned Luna-3 craft used lunar gravitation to produce a return  trajectory that would be better for the transmission of images  of the far side of the Moon. The researchers here show that a  good number of missions to asteroids that are approaching the  Earth's orbit can use lunar gravity to good effect, i.e., the  fuel savings would enable larger payloads. Most profiles require  that a velocity of 1.3-2.5 km/s be achieved, which means that  more than 150 m/s could be saved with a lunar flyby in terms of  characteristic velocity. The trajectory proposed would  approximate sectors of conical sections. If used for the mission  to the McAuliffe asteroid in the INEO project, the savings in  characteristic velocity would be 183 m/s. Figures 3, references  7: 5 Russian, 2 Western.</p>

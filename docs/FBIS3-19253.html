On the weekend, Christian Social Union [CSU]  politicians demanded that the government change its course and  emphasized their right to cocreate European policy. The Free  Democratic Party [FDP] sharply rejected their coalition  partner's initiative yesterday. [passage omitted]    CSU Land Group Chairman Michael Glos stressed that the "key  problem" is that Europe is a giant in terms of economy, but a  dwarf politically. Glos said it is "intolerable" that the  Social Democratic Party [SPD] still opposes an amendment of the  constitution that would allow German forces to participate in  missions outside NATO territory.    According to FDP Secretary General Werner Hoyer, the CSU's  shooting forward in foreign policy matters is a mock attack.  The CSU is "deeply at odds" in European policy and presents  "completely differing positions to the outside," Hoyer said.  Thus, the Maastricht Treaty bears Waigel's signature on the one  hand, while on the other Bavarian Minister President Edmund  Stoiber (CSU) "takes every opportunity to spoil this agreement  and the European idea." Hoyer said that a calm course and  predictability are especially important now if one wants to  achieve something for Germany in terms of foreign policy.    The CSU's demands have also been criticized by SPD Bundestag  Group Chairman Hans-Ulrich Klose. He strongly rejected Waigel's  demand for a quick association of the East European reform  states up to full membership in NATO and the European Union  (EU). The EU is in a difficult position at the moment: "We do  not want a mega-EU," Klose said at the Spring Conference of the  Political Club of the Tutzing Protestant Academy. He said he  does not see any chance for countries like the Ukraine to be  accepted in the next 15 years.</p>

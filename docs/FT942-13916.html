			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Lloyds / Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester: Rest of sector given something to think about The news of the deal filtered through yesterday to the annual meeting of Woolwich Building Society, where the question was raised most pertinently by an investor in both Woolwich and Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester. Her intervention was perhaps the first pointed example of what may become a trend. 'Other societies' investors may be asking themselves how much their society would be worth,' Mr Andrew Longhurst, C&amp;G chief executive, said. The deal also poses a difficult question for building society managements. The common theme of societies' reactions was that C&amp;G had been widely expected to do something. Its character of being a niche society in the mortgage market meant that what would make sense for C&amp;G would not necessarily make sense for other large societies. Even so, at least one leading society is holding a special senior management meeting today to discuss the issues arising from the deal. Mr Longhurst was right to envisage his equivalents scratching their heads. Societies, however, are cautious and conscious of the benefits they derive from being mutuals. There is no sign of an immediate stampede to follow C&amp;G into plc status, though in the longer-term the deal does make it more likely that societies will convert. 'It does not change our position on mutuality,' said Mr Mike Blackburn, chief executive of Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest. 'The last five years' results have clearly demonstrated our ability to compete effectively as a mutual with the best in the financial services industry.' Similarly, Mr Peter White, chief executive of Alliance &amp; Leicester commented merely that it was all the more important to continue with the strategy the group had been developing. Others see more fundamental changes. Mr Peter Robinson, Woolwich managing director, for example, saw the deal as potentially meaning the end of the traditional building society merger, by having changed the scale of incentives that are be offered to members. It will also increase the pressure for radical changes from the review of the Building Societies Act being carried out by the Treasury. The results of the first stage are due to be announced next month. Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive of Nationwide, the second largest society, is among those advocating that legislative constraints on societies should be abolished, in order to allow them to compete more effectively. And as smaller and weaker societies worry how the presence in the mortgage market of the powerful combination of Lloyds and C&amp;G will undermine their ability to compete, there is another, perhaps brighter, side for them to consider. The revived interest of banks in building societies may mean that there is a new category of potential rescuers for them if they do fail.</p>

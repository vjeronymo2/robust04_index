			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / European Property 10: Building-site boom is deceptive - Portugal / The main sources of concern are high interest rates and the maintenance of antiquated rental laws A SHORT walk around Lisbon and Oporto would convince almost anyone that Portugal is in the midst of a construction and property boom. Streets are cluttered with building materials and it is often difficult, not to say dangerous, to make one's way around countless obstructions caused by building sites and excavations as new buildings spring up, old ones are renovated and new water and gas mains, sewers and telephone lines are installed. All this activity is deceiving. After four years of rapid growth and escalating prices, the property market is facing more uncertain prospects. Signs that all is not well come from property developers, builders and owners who have been calling on the government to take urgent action to revive the property sector. The main concerns are high interest rates, and the maintenance of antiquated rental laws. They say high interest rates are discouraging investment, increasing financial pressures on companies with large debts or exposures on developments that have yet to be completed, and deterring buyers in the residential market. Outdated legislation covering tenancy rights and rents has had a negative impact mainly on the commercial and housing markets. The law is generally favourable to tenants who can renew their leases indefinitely with rents indexed at or below inflation. Over the years this has meant that the bulk of rents have lost all connection with the market, apart from a small section represented by up-market homes where rents have rocketed to levels comparable to those in London or Paris. A law was passed a year ago authorising new contracts in the housing sector to be drawn up for a minimum period of five years and allowing repossession when the agreement expires. But the bulk of properties was left unaffected by the change and the sad spectacle of often potentially handsome houses in the main cities deteriorating to the point where they collapse because owners cannot, or will not, afford to renovate and maintain them, is unlikely to end in the foreseeable future. The law also tightened up on tenancy rights, reducing the scope for tenants to pass on their rented home to friends and distant relatives. But overall it failed short of expectations in the industry which had pressed for a broader and deeper liberalisation of the market. Last year's slow-down in the rate of growth of the Portuguese economy also had a negative impact, especially in the north of the country where the bulk of Portugal's traditional industries are located. Recession elsewhere has slowed foreign demand and leisure developments in the Algarve, along Portugal's southern coast, have suffered as a result. Up-market mini-resorts such as Vilamoura and Quinta do Lago continue to find buyers, but over-building in other parts of the coast has taken its toll. There are some bright spots. The market for offices is still strong, although not uniformly. Demand for industrial property in the Lisbon and Setubal areas remains strong especially for high quality premises. 'Because of the limited supply, capital values for both completed (modern) property and industrial land have seen increases of some 100 per cent since 1987,' says Mr Eric Van Leuven of agents Healey &amp; Baker. There are also several new large developments for shopping centres and office parks, but the overall picture for the sector is very different from what it was two years ago when money was flowing into the market and construction companies' order books were full - helped by a wave of public sector projects backed by funds from the European Community. Most activity is concentrated in central Lisbon, greater Lisbon and outlying areas including around Setubal - an important industrial centre - and Oporto. The Lisbon office market is relatively small with a total stock of 2m square metres, at least two thirds of which does not meet international standards. Rental and capital values have risen rapidly since Portugal's accession to the EC in 1986 although prices are levelling off as supply is gradually matching demand. Some 800,000 square metres of office space are currently under construction and the market could suffer from over-supply by 1994, according to research by Healey &amp; Baker. Central Lisbon has seen the greatest slow-down with the exception of a handful of high quality developments. 'The biggest buyers have been the Spaniards. They have been willing to pay high prices for prestige locations,' says Mr David Sampson, publisher of Portugal Property Review. But demand has slowed as companies move out of the centre into new and cheaper developments. Buying prices in the centre of Lisbon for prime locations are close to Es700,000 per square metre. Demand for rented premises has remained strong due to the shortage of supply of good quality offices, which keeps prices high at about Es6,750 per square metre per month for top locations. Demand for retail outlets in or near the city centre remains high, boosted by current demand from international retail chains moving into the Portuguese market. Because of the shortage of supply, rents have escalated - rising by 17 per cent in the last six months of 1991. Activity is strongest in the greater Lisbon area and outlying districts with large office and commercial developments about to start. The recently-opened Cascais shopping centre with more than 150 shops, including four international department stores, is already almost fully let. In Oporto, Portugal's second largest city, there has been intense activity in the past three years with prices rising rapidly. Planning restrictions have stifled developments in the centre and Boavista, to the west, is emerging as the new prime location. Prime office space now sells for about Es425,000 per square metre. Agents Mathew &amp; Goodman say that provided the economy remains strong, demand should average 25,000 to 30,000 square metres a year, but it could fall sharply if the economy slows down. With a few exceptions, foreign demand in all sectors of the market remains depressed. 'Foreign companies coming to Portugal tend to buy existing companies with their own premises or make joint ventures. Either way, this has limited effect on the market for new property, while institutional investors and developers are put off by the rent legislation, and until that changes they are likely to stay away,' says Mr Van Leuven.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- ADDITIONAL PROPERTY COSTS  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Landlords costs in letting  Letting fees: 8.3 per cent-10 per cent of a building               of annual rent                             Yearly property tax of up to 1.3 per cent                             of the property value                             Insurance of approx 0.025 per cent of                             the property value  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Tenants costs in leasing    Letting fees: 8.3 per cent-10 per cent of a building               of annual rent                             Service charge: variable  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Sale costs by investor      Agents fees: 2.5 per cent-5 per cent or owner/occupier  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Purchase costs by investor  Acquisition cost: 10 per cent of or owner/occupier           purchase price for all propeties in excess                             of Es21m                             Notary fees: 0.5 per cent                             Legal fees: 0.5                             Registration charge: 0.5  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Healey &amp; Baker  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

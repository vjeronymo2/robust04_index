			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Aid and reform in Nigeria When General Ibrahim Babangida called for debt relief last week, he was throwing down the gauntlet. Help me, or take responsibility for Nigeria's recovery programme buckling under the weight of service payments on its Dollars 34bn external debt, his budget address implied. Nigeria's partners should take up the challenge, but not in the way Mr Babangida may expect. The president made an important point: running a large current account surplus in order to service external debt is incompatible with economic recovery. Generous concessional treatment of debt-burdened African economies is essential if the continent's development crisis is to end. But debt write-offs and other assistance should be linked to good government, a policy put to such good effect in Kenya recently. Like President Daniel arap Moi, General Babangida must first set his house in order before qualifying for help: this means curbing corruption, ending human rights abuses and improving Nigeria's faltering economic management. Mr Babangida deserved approval for the reform programme introduced in 1986, a year after the coup that brought him to power. Measures which include trade liberalisation, a more realistic exchange rate, a privatisation plan that affects nearly 100 companies, and agricultural reforms, have improved Nigeria's economic prospects. Erratic process But it has been an erratic process, delayed by weak management, poor implementation, uncertain political will and endemic corruption. Last year progress again stalled. An over-expansionary fiscal policy, heavy reliance on domestic bank borrowing, a growing gap between the official and parallel exchange rates, saw Nigeria fail a mid-term review of a 15-month International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreement. Meanwhile there remain unanswered questions about the size and allocation of Nigeria's oil earnings, in particular the windfall from the price surge during the Gulf war. Manifestly uneconomic projects have been pursued, such as the disastrous Ajaokuta steel plant. Lavish spending on the new federal capital, Abuja, is at odds with economic realities. Nor is all well on the political front. President Babangida has won praise for his commitment to a phased return to civilian rule, made well before the new winds of democratic change swept across Africa. But the transition process, due to conclude with presidential elections by the end of this year, is deeply flawed. Queuing system The government banned all independent parties and created two of its own. Both had their manifestos written by government officials. Voting takes place under the queuing system - dropped by Kenya in response to domestic and international criticism - which entails a public count of voters lined up according to their choice of candidate. Thousands of would-be candidates were banned from all but the last stages of the transition because of their association with past administrations. Nigeria's record on a broader human rights front is arguably worse than Kenya's. Offences range from the razing of a Lagos slum in 1990 which left thousands of families homeless, to preventing a civil rights lawyer from attending last October's Commonwealth conference in Harare. Military decrees override the authority of the courts. Students have been arrested and detained without charge, trade unions have been harassed, a leading newspaper closed down for ten days, and journalists arrested. Throughout this period, there has been barely a squeak of protest from Nigeria's main partners. The World Bank, Britain and the United States, so forthright in their criticism of Kenya, have been curiously restrained when it comes to Nigeria. Yet their influence is considerable. The World Bank and its affiliates have committed more than Dollars 6bn to Nigeria. Britain is supporting Nigeria's request for help under the Trinidad terms, which offer big write-offs of official debt. Mr Babangida should be told that sauce for the Kenyan goose is also sauce for the Nigerian gander.</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> SALUTE TO AN IDEA MAN  </P> <P> Frank Lloyd Wright did not need to design a house for Ayn Rand or be  fictionalized as Howard Roark in "The Fountainhead" in order to be remembered,  but the fact he was seems salient. He was born to an era that produced  larger-than-life personalities ranging the cultural spectrum from James Joyce  to Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the Pablos -- Picasso and Casals.  </P> <P> Wright certainly left a personal myth, but it rests on a foundation of  unforgettable architectural images etched in the collective mind -- from the  levitating balconies of "Falling Water" to the conch-shell spiral of the  Guggenheim Museum. His memory lives vividly in Los Angeles because of the  Hollyhock House in Barnsdall Park and -- more recently -- because of his  apparent influence on Bruce Goff's design for the new Japanese pavilion at the  County Museum of Art.  </P> <P> Wright's place as a keystone of the modernist movement was already solidly  established when he died in 1959 at age 92, and it has never budged. One can  not, however, remember the last major exhibition devoted to his work.  </P> <P> Now there is a welcome one visiting the San Diego Museum of Art through August.  Called "Frank Lloyd Wright in the Realm of Ideas," it does two things very  well: It provides a chance for a fresh take on his legacy and it solves the  most besetting problem of architectural exhibitions.  </P> <P> Normally such shows let us down because no number of drawings, models, and  photomurals quite make up for the lack of real buildings. Here you have the  authentic thing -- erected in front of the museum -- in the form of one of  Wright's '50s designs for what he called his "Usonian Automatic Houses." They  were intended to provide custom-built dwellings at moderate cost. Walking  around in it is more fun -- and provides a livelier sense of the Wrightian  aesthetic -- than a barn full of documentation.  </P> <P> And what was Wright's aesthetic? As everyone familiar with his work knows, he  was very big on Organic Architecture. This is not architecture grown in a  health-food store . . . but sort of.  </P> <P> One of the most striking things about Wright's work is its apparent  eclecticism. He seems to have worked in as many varied manners as Picasso.  Wright once romanced the Romanesque, remembering his early mentor Louis  Sullivan. Despite his undeniable modernity, elements of updated Craftsman style  come out in much of his furniture. A pared-down sense of traditional Japanese  recurs, but not in the concrete block buildings that look decidedly  pre-Columbian. If we decide firmly he was an avant-gardist with roots in the  past, he trips up the idea with designs that would look right at home in "Star  Trek." His proposal for a Xanadu pleasure dome for Huntington Hartford looks  like it should be called "Overflowing Saucers."  </P> <P> The rationale for all of this is that Wright first decided the traditional  box-shaped building was too confining. Beginning with his 1906 Larkin Building  he tried to "beat the box" and never looked back. That done, he became what  today would be called a "site-specific" artist, tailoring each structure to the  lay of the land. He also tried to respond to materials -- including modern  innovations like reinforced steel and concrete -- seeking the solution to his  design problems within the problem itself.  </P> <P> His best results, like the prairie houses and Taliesan, have astonishing  internal integrity and are utterly integral to their surroundings. Well, not  quite. They become romantic gestures of stylish unity with the land. One  admires details like his Constructivist-Deco windows even as they give him away  as a mandarin exquisite.  </P> <P> Wright was a genius with facets. If he exploded the box he never forgot the  cave, the tepee, the mosque and the temple, marking himself as an Exotic Noble  Savage. In his Techno-Islamic phase he designed an Arizona State Capital that  one is jolly glad was never built.  </P> <P> What comes across most strongly about Wright today is his visionary  romanticism. He had grand ideas about American democracy that outstripped  either geography or politics and entered the realm of metaphysical fantasy. In  that sense he was an inheritor of Antonio Gaudi and a forerunner of Paolo  Soleri. Wright was very concerned about his artistic progeny, but there are  very few direct Wrightian inheritors today. That's partly because he was a very  hard act to follow and partly because he was individualistic to the point of  idiosyncrasy.  </P> <P> The Usonian house in front of the museum looks at once striking and  domesticated with its chunky gray block construction, but the minute you're  inside it feels a trifle odd. Everything is organized along a single long  corridor that runs the length of the facade, beginning with the kitchen and  ending with the master bathroom, which has no door. Bedrooms and a study off  the tunnel-like axial corridor are beautifully detailed, but so underscaled  they feel like steamship staterooms.  </P> <P> By marked contrast, a copious terrace and high-ceilinged living room force the  sculptural contrast of spatial sizes. It's artistically dramatic, but does make  one long for more harmonious distribution of emphasis.  </P> <P> Glib psycho-architectural observers have traced Wright's love of contrasting  spaces and ceiling heights to the fact he was himself small of stature and  inclined to design for his own bodily dimensions.  </P> <P> Whatever the truth, Wright's houses tend to exaggerate a problem inherent in  most structures designed by modern architects with great talent and strong  convictions. The buildings may be things of artistic joy, but they never become  the spiritual dwellings of the inhabitants. No matter who owns them they always  belong to the architect.  </P></p>

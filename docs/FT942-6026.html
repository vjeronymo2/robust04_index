			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / World Trade News: US takes harder line on Japan Britain and the US have very different approaches toward gaining access to Japanese markets, British Trade Minister Richard Needham, said yesterday. Mr Needham was speaking at the launch of an 'Action Japan' campaign. A Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) panel said in a report released yesterday the US is 'without parallel' in imposing measures that force its trading partners to abide by unilateral judgments. It said the US shows no signs of abandoning this practice. Asked why the US has received lucrative orders from Japanese businesses, Mr Needham said: 'I don't think you can in practical terms play the part of the bully, unless you're bigger than the other guy. If the other guy's bigger than you, and you try and be the bully, you're likely to end up on your back.' The Action Japan campaign, which follows on from the Opportunity Japan (1988-91) and Priority Japan (1991-1994) campaigns, aims to increase British visible exports to Pounds 3.5bn by 1996, up from Pounds 2.6bn in 1993.</p>

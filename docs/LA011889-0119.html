			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SANTA CLARA'S WITHDRAWAL FROM TOURNAMENT TO BE DISCUSSED  </P> <P> The impact of Santa Clara High School's withdrawal on the South Coast Christmas  basketball tournament will be discussed at a hearing Jan. 30.  </P> <P> The Southern Section's Executive Committee -- Principal Tom Jacobson of Corona  del Mar, Superintendent Bruce Keuning of the Bellflower Christian Schools,  Superintendent Robert Packer of the Duarte Unified School District and  Principal Gary Smidderks of Los Angeles Baptist -- will listen to testimony and  make a recommendation.  </P> <P> Scheduled to appear at the hearing will be Lou Cvijanovich, Santa Clara  basketball coach, Anne Metcalf, Santa Clara principal and Chuck and Art Perry,  tournament directors.  </P> <P> Santa Clara, which had a written contract to participate in the 16-team  tournament, failed to appear for a consolation-round game against Laguna Hills  on Dec. 29.  </P> <P> Cvijanovich made the decision not to appear after a 39-38 loss to Edison the  previous day. Cvijanovich blamed the loss on the officiating, which he felt  favored Edison.  </P> <P> Santa Clara forfeited two games by failing to appear for the remainder of the  tournament, a violation of Rule 151.3 of the Southern Section rule book ("When  a school fails to engage in a contest agreed upon, without giving notice to the  other school and securing an honorable release, it may be suspended from  membership.")  </P> <P> "The committee met last weekend and reviewed statements that were submitted in  writing and felt a hearing was necessary before taking action," said Dean  Crowley, Southern Section associate commissioner.  </P> <P> "The committee will listen to testimony in a closed hearing and then make a  recommendation following its meeting on Feb. 16. Also at issue is the financial  impact Santa Clara's withdrawal had on the tournament."  </P> <P> Crowley said that he and Commissioner Stan Thomas would be at the meeting. TOM  HAMILTON  </P></p>

Sgt. Paul Hauptman said no one was hurt in the incident in the  south Sacramento suburb of Florin. "We just went through a living nightmare and  we just don't understand why," homeowner Othella Jenkins said, adding that she  had never experienced any problems in the neighborhood where she has lived  three years.  </P></p>

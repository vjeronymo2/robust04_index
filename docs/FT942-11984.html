			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): Sizeable mortgage operation should boost revival - Bank of Scotland This week should see the restoration of the Bank of Scotland, whose good reputation slipped slightly last year when it announced an 11 per cent fall in pre-tax profits. The results for the year to February 28 released on Thursday are expected to reflect both a fall in provisions for bad and doubtful debts, and an increase in pre-provision profits. Most analysts expect pre-tax profits to rise to Pounds 250m-Pounds 270m, and forecasts extend up to Pounds 285m. In any event, they are sharply up on the equivalent for the previous year of Pounds 125.3m. Last year's figures included a 45 per cent rise in provisions for bad debts which, the bank said, reflected the downturn moving north into Scotland, coupled with a further fall in asset values in the south. Apart from the drop in provisions, as a result of a fragile recovery in the housing market, the bank has also had an opportunity to reap a full year's benefits from being able to widen its margins in its sizeable mortgage lending operation. That widening of margins was an element in raising the bank's interim pre-tax profits announced last October by 58 per cent to Pounds 117.6m. In general, the bank has won the reputation of being less accident-prone than others, and of running operations efficiently. The cost-income ratio it reported in the interim results fell to just below 50 per cent, and could fall slightly further, if it is able to expand its mortgage business. At the interim results, Mr Bruce Pattullo, chief executive, made it clear that he expected a further improvement in fee and income commission through bank branches. The bank has been one of those identified as considering buying a building society: this would be one way of accelerating its growth, but the bank will not want an acquisition that would threaten its efficiency.</p>

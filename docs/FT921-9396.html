			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Trade and the Environment: Gatt issues warning against environmental imperialism BEWARE protectionists who disguise themselves in environmentalists' clothing: beware the temptation to assume the role of global environmental vigilante: and don't forget that a set of effective environmental protection laws will always be better than - and will normally pre-empt the need for - trade weapons in defence of the environment. These siren calls provide a haunting chorus throughout the 35-page report on trade and the environment published today by the Geneva-based secretariat to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). The long-awaited report, delayed by hectic but so far fruitless efforts to complete the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation, is intended to trigger debate in this controversial area in the run-up to June's 'earth summit' in Brazil. Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, said yesterday these were 'not Gatt's first words on the subject, nor the last'. They are nevertheless expected to shape a debate in which advocates of free trade try to persuade increasingly militant environmental groups that free trade is not synonymous with providing a licence to pollute the globe. Among the points made most forcefully by the report are: The European Community's fiercely protectionist Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is inflicting serious environmental damage on the globe. Countries with large forest areas are currently providing 'carbon absorption services' free of charge. Instead of imposing trade sanctions on them for exporting logs, they should be properly paid for these carbon absorption services. Countries are not clones of each other. They have a sovereign right to declare different environmental priorities and policies. Gatt's rules and dispute settlement procedures will not frustrate any country's efforts to improve domestic environmental standards. While they might frustrate unilateral 'vigilante' action by one country against another, they provide a working framework for winning multilateral agreement. There is a close link between wealth and improved environmental protection. Trade barriers that frustrate developing countries' ability to improve living standards will at the same time frustrate efforts to raise standards of environmental protection. Tariff walls are no more justified to protect the competitiveness of companies that have incurred the cost of meeting strict environmental standards than they are to protect companies that pay more corporation tax, or spend more on research and development. On the contrary, such companies are likely to become market leaders as a result of such investment. The report's fiercest language is reserved for protectionists in general and US and European farm policymakers in particular: 'Existing agricultural protection not only fails to help the environment, but almost certainly is an important source of environmental degradation,' the report says. US land set-aside programmes have prompted farmers to aim for higher yields on remaining land, 'which almost certainly has involved increased per-acre use of chemicals'. High support prices in land-scarce countries, backed up by tariff walls, have a similar effect, the report argues. It notes that countries like Argentina, Australia and Thailand use less than 10 per cent of the chemical fertiliser per hectare used by Europe's farmers. The report accuses 'particular producer groups' of having succeeded in the past 'in manipulating domestic environmental policies to benefit themselves at the expense of both the rest of the economy and ultimately even the environment'. It warns environmental groups to be wary of efforts by protectionist lobbies to draw them into 'implicit or explicit alliances'. The report queries whether trade measures are ever likely to be the most effective means of achieving environmental improvements. In a clear call for the Rio summit in June to gain more multilateral consensus on policies intended to protect the environment, the report notes: 'If all countries participated in all international environmental agreements, there would be nothing more to add.' There are repeated warnings against unilateral action by governments to export domestic environmental policies - a clear measure of the Gatt's anxiety over a tendency, particularly in the US, to resort to trade weapons to force good environmental practice on other countries. In a reference to a recent controversial ruling against a US decision to ban imports of Mexican yellowfin tuna because fishing methods led to the killing of dolphin that swim above tuna shoals, the report recalled: 'A country may not restrict imports of a product solely because it originates in a country whose environmental policies are different.' If allowed, this would create a loophole allowing any country 'unilaterally to apply trade restrictions not for the purpose of enforcing its own laws within its own jurisdiction, but to impose the standards set out in its laws on other countries'. Such environmental imperialism would be a fast track to trade chaos and conflict, it argues. It is in its defence of a country's sovereign right to set its own environmental priorities that the Gatt wades into deepest controversy: 'Countries are not clones of each other,' it argues. This lays open the danger that a country might condone poor environmental standards, encourage the migration of polluting industries - a problem that should be tackled by open debate in multinational forums, not by vigilante action by self-appointed guardians of self-defined environmental imperatives. The Gatt accepts that when pollution does not remain inside a country's borders, or affects the 'global commons' like the ozone layer or deforestation, then 'inter-governmental co-operation is likely to be essential'. It nevertheless insists that unilateral action must be resisted, and that the cost of action should be skewed both towards those who pollute, and those who have the ability to pay. The report is anyway sceptical about the effectiveness of present trade weapons aimed at tackling problems like deforestation and the uncontrolled slaughter of elephants to fuel the trade in ivory. A close examination of efforts to restrict the trade in tropical timber argues that a ban would do nothing to reduce deforestation: instead it proposes that the advanced industrial countries, whose carbon dioxide emissions account for most global warming, should compensate forested countries for their 'carbon absorption services'. Non-payment for these services means a country like Brazil 'has little or no incentive to take such services into account in deciding on the optimal management of its forest resource'. While the Gatt is not so brash as to claim that free trade provides a panacea for solving environmental problems, it contests the view that liberal trade is a villainous contributor to degradation: 'Conceivably, an expansion of trade could produce negative environmental effects so large that they outweigh the conventional benefits from open markets (increased specialisation, more competition and so forth). 'However, this is possible only if a country lacks a domestic environmental policy that reflects its environmental values and priorities,' the report argues. Also, failure to place a proper value on environmental resources would undermine sustainable development even in a completely closed economy, it says. Trade could be no more than a 'magnifier'. Much more likely, expanded trade will lead to greater wealth and a diffusion of technology - both of which enhance a society's ability to protect and upgrade its environment. The principal challenge, it concludes, is to exploit those ways in which open international trade 'can contribute, in conjunction with appropriate national environmental policies, to the improvement and protection of the environment'.</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: Siemens pays Dollars 38m for Polish telecoms producers SIEMENS is to pay USDollars 38.5m for two Polish telecommunications and electronic equipment producers in an agreement that gives it access, along with Alcatel of Spain and AT&amp;T of the US, to the rapidly expanding Polish telecoms market. The deal signed yesterday also signals confidence by a major western investor that Poland's market reforms will continue following the weekend elections. 'We are moving ahead with full speed,' said Mr Lothar Plehwe, a senior director at Siemens said in Warsaw. 'We hear that all the elected parties want to continue with the process of privatisation.' Siemens has promised to invest Dollars 57m over six years in the two plants, ZWUT in Warsaw, which is primarily a telecommunications equipment producer, and Elwro in Wroclaw, an electronics plant. Both companies have heavy borrowings and Dollars 30.2m of the purchase price will go to covering debt. Last year AT&amp;T paid Dollars 28m for the Telfa in Bydgoszcz and promised to invest Dollars 45m in the plant. Alcatel has paid Dollars 37.3m for the PZT works in Warsaw and Teletra in Poznan, and agreed to invest Dollars 60m in both factories. Ericsson of Sweden has been chosen as a prospective supplier of mobile radio equipment for the armed forces in a contract worth around Dollars 100m. It would also involve joint production with the Unimor television plant in Gdansk. TP SA, the Polish state-owned telephone monopoly which made a profit of 5,400bn zlotys (USDollars 277m) last year on sales of 19,000bn zlotys, plans to invest some 10,000bn zlotys this year. Between 1990 and 1992, Poland installed some 800,000 lines. A further 540,000 will be put in this year and another 8m lines should be in place by the end of the decade at a cost of up to Dollars 1.5bn a year. This will increase the number of telephones per 100 inhabitants to 20, according to Privatisation Ministry estimates. Yesterday Mr Plehwe warned that Siemens' investment in Poland would only prove successful if the government sticks to its development plans. However, the German group has the right to cut its investment commitment in ZWUT and Elwro if the telephone authorities fail to provide the contracts on the scale at present envisaged. Foreign suppliers of telecommunications equipment to Poland have been told they must produce locally half of the product to be supplied. They must also purchase state sector companies if they are to have a share of the domestic market. Financing for TPSA's investment programme has come from a Dollars 200m World Bank loan as well as the European Investment Bank and commercial credits raised by suppliers.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Interior Minister Manfred Kanther in </F> Bonn by Ulrich Wickert in Hamburg on 22 March -- recorded]    [Text] [Wickert] Good evening, Mr. Kanther.    [Kanther] Good evening, Mr. Wickert.    [Wickert] Mr. Kanther, how was the nationwide action by the  Kurds possible without the police knowing about it?    [Kanther] We will clear up this matter. I believe that the  violent criminals must be arrested immediately. All possible  investigations have to be initiated by the police.    [Wickert] It would be important to know why that was  possible. The Kurds started their actions several days ago. The  police should have known that something might happen.    [Kanther] We know that, unfortunately, the Kurdish Workers  Party [PKK] can rely on good logistic structures -- not only in  Germany. It is also clear that we will have to increase our  efforts to obtain relevant information. The ban of the PKK was  an initial step. However, it is obvious that we must adopt more  far-reaching measures.    [Wickert] Are the current incidents not proof that the ban  of the PKK was not efficient?    [Kanther] No, it is the other way around. The question is:  Should we have refrained from this step and done nothing? We  naturally collected information and data, and we found weapons  but not enough. Thus, we must now adopt tough measures against  the offenders and use this opportunity to obtain additional  information on the PKK. The ban must be further implemented,  and the possibilities provided by the aliens' law --  particularly deportation -- must be fully utilized.    [Wickert] Do you proceed from the premise that the PKK is  behind the actions?    [Kanther] I am quite certain.    [Wickert] Can you prove it?    [Kanther] I am certain that there are no other Kurdish  organizations that would have been in a position to organize  rallies by hundreds of thousands of people in several large  German towns last Sunday [20 March]. I am convinced that  today's actions on the motorways were organized by the same  group. I will do everything possible to use these data together  with the interior ministers of the laender to initiate criminal  proceedings and trials on the basis of the aliens' law.    [Wickert] You are offering the laender the help of the  Federal Border Police. Do you believe the police in the laender  are not capable of solving the problem?    [Kanther] No, not at all. I am convinced that my  counterparts in the laender -- the interior ministers -- are  aware of the danger that these actions pose in the criminal  sense. I am sure they know that these actions may disturb the  peaceful coexistence between Germans and foreigners -- between  Germans and Kurds in particular. They will take vigorous action  to clear up these things. However, if barricades are  established in many places on motorways and if fires are laid,  the help of the Federal Border Police might be welcome. This is  the reason I offered it.    [Wickert] Thank you very much, Mr. Kanther.    [Kanther] Good bye, Mr. Wickert.</p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Congress backing sought in foreign aid drive Clinton administration officials are due to meet congressional leaders today to launch months of discussion on an overhaul of US foreign aid structures and procedures. Mr Brian Atwood, administrator of the US Agency for International Development (AID), is expected to brief senior members of Congress on the draft legislation the administration has submitted to simplify aid programmes and concentrate US foreign aid on a limited number of strategic themes. The administration hopes to pass the bill in Congress's next session, early next year, rewriting a 1961 law. Under current law, AID pursues 33 separate goals and 75 priority areas. Instead of this scattered approach, the administration wants to focus on health, population control, the environment, economic growth and democracy. Mr Atwood said he hoped discussions over the next few months could bring consensus on the sort of reform needed. 'There is no doubt that there is a consensus that we've got to reform our aid programme,' Mr Atwood said in Washington at a meeting arranged by the newspaper USA Today International. In the draft proposals submitted to Congress, the administration asks for more flexibility to deal with changing situations, instead of the 'earmarks' attached by members of Congress to foreign aid bills to stipulate exactly where AID must spend its money. AID will reduce its operations to around 50 countries, eliminating some whose economies have developed beyond the point where they need concessional assistance and tying aid to recipients' performance. Mr Atwood has already announced closure of 21 AID field missions in countries such as Argentina, Chile, Ivory Coast and Zaire, either because they are now deemed creditworthy on their own or because they are considered 'poor partners in development' until their undemocratic governments change their policies. Nevertheless, the US will continue to aid a dozen countries for more strategic reasons. Israel and Egypt, biggest aid recipients today, will continue to receive money, as will the former Soviet Union.</p>

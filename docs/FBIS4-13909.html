			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ahmad Quray', PLO's Economic Department </F> head, by unidentified correspondent in Paris; date not given --  recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] At the end of last week's round of  economic talks you sounded upbeat. You said the Paris talks  have progressed. Are you still in the same optimistic mood?    [Quray'] Despite the crisis that arose during this round, I  cannot but be optimistic as I fulfill such a difficult and  arduous role in the negotiations. The moment I cease to be  optimistic, I must withdraw from the talks. By their nature,  negotiations -- in particular, the economic talks -- are  difficult and arduous. We are dealing with an adversary bent on  remaining in a dominant position. Then you have the Palestinian  side striving to get results. The question of optimism or  pessimism, for me, does not arise. In this round in particular,  progress was made in the area of tourism, where agreement was  reached on a paper. There is not much of a problem there for  us. The tough problem that remains is the question of imports  and trade and their economic implications. This, despite our  having agreed on a principle, which I consider to be important  and a gain; namely, the need for there to be an importation  policy and a customs tariff policy regulating a number of key  goods central to development and everyday life of the  Palestinian people in the occupied territories, in terms of  pricing, tariffs, import licenses for commercial exchange with  Arab and other states. We could not agree on what these goods  will be. We hope the Israelis will rethink their position when  we meet next week. Another contentious issue was the bank  notes. The talks bogged down over the Palestinian currency and  the Israeli shekel -- whether the latter would be legal tender  or a currency. We insist on it being a currency. These were  the sticking points.    [Correspondent] This round also addressed Palestinian  manpower. How much progress was made there?    [Quray'] We raised the issue from the angle of the hardships  our workers are suffering due to the closure that has barred the  Palestinian workers from Israel. That applies as much to the  laborers who work in the occupied territories as it does to  those who commute to Israel. We underscored the dangerous  implications of these measures for the entire peace process.  They said there will be flexibility on this matter, noting that  some 5,000 Palestinian workers have been allowed back to their  jobs and that $10 million worth of funds have been set aside to  alleviate unemployment in Gaza and the West Bank. But that will  not solve the problem. The Palestinian workers must be engaged  in steady employment and job opportunities must be created for  them in the context of the national Palestinian economy. To  create jobs in the context of a national Palestinian national  economy is an ambitious and difficult task that will not  materialize by wishing it. It takes preparations and the  building of an infrastructure.    [Correspondent] Many Palestinians and some Palestinian  factions fear that Israel will dominate the Palestinian economy  after the establishment of self-rule. What do you have to say  about that fear?    [Quray'] Let me say that such a fear is legitimate but does  not have to be our fate at all, and that Israel may desire such  a dominance but Israel's desires also do not have to be our  fate. Therefore, I can say that these economic talks are the  most important of all the Palestinian-Israeli talks because they  lay the groundwork for the work of our institutions during the  transitional stage. Can these institutions achieve a total  Palestinian economic independence through the Palestinian rights  they will regain? This is the question. Therefore, I can  reassure those who voice their concern, which is legitimate, as  I have said, that our negotiating strategy, if realized, will  pave the way for economic independence. Let me give an example:  It is known that during its early days, the occupation  completely paralyzed the economic movement by closing banks,  which constitute the lifeline of the Palestinian economy. All  these banks were replaced by Israeli banks. All Palestinian,  Arab, Jordanian, or foreign banks were closed. This took place  in the early days of the 1967 occupation, and Israeli  institutions replaced them. This is the situation. Therefore,  the Palestinian negotiator should achieve his strategy by taking  a first step toward regaining the right to license, monitor, and  run the banks in accordance with Palestinian economic plan and  structure. I can assert and proudly say that we have regained  our right to build a Palestinian monetary and financial  institution, which has the right to license, monitor, and run  the banks and issue instructions and legislations regarding  banking activity in the occupied Palestinian territories. This  issue is not an easy one. The second issue, frankly speaking,  is part of our policy and our strategy. It is aimed at  penetrating the customs wall that has been built around the  occupied territories since the early days of the occupation,  represented by the customs policy, exports, and trade exchange  policy. I also can say that we will not regain our full rights.  However, we have penetrated that customs wall by securing the  Palestinian right to import from Arab countries. It is we who  should define the customs tariff with the Arabs and it is we who  should define the policies and the specifications, make  assessments and analysis, and conduct all activity pertaining to  imports from the Arabs. Thus, this is a penetration in the  customs wall. The other issue is with the Arab and Islamic  countries. Israel, as well as other countries, usually imports  from countries maintaining relations with it. Therefore, the  penetration took place when we clarified that the occupied  territories are a Palestinian identity and entity and not part  of Israel. So, it is we who define the policy of the  disengagement process. What is important in our strategy is  that through these negotiations, we should achieve disengagement  with the Israeli economy, which dominates the Palestinian  economy. How can we penetrate the customs, gradually achieve  disengagement, and build new rules for relations based on  cooperation. There is a very important point, which can only be  understood by the Palestinian farmer; namely, the principle of  reciprocity in agricultural exports. It has been previously  known that the Palestinian market was dominated by the Israeli  agricultural products, while the Palestinians were not allowed  to export any of their vegetables or fruits to the Israeli  market. The new agricultural agreement stipulates the  Palestinian right to export to the Israeli market. Thousands of  tonnes of vegetables and fruits are destroyed every year because  they cannot be marketed. The same also applies to industry. We  also have the right to reciprocity and to license the industry  that serves and promotes our economy.    [Correspondent] Will there be direct economic ties between  the Palestinian entity and the outside, meaning Arab countries  such as Jordan and other countries, without passing through  Israel, given that the balance of economic and political power  is in Israel's favor? Does the Palestinian economy enjoy  freedom and guarantees?    [Quray'] Yes. Very lengthy negotiations were held over this  issue. The Israelis' logic was that the occupied territories  are still within the framework of the transitional period. That  is, these occupied territories are not a state and, hence, they  should be under Israeli control.    We categorically rejected this logic. In the end, we reached  the conclusion that since our relations with the Arabs represent  our strategic depth, then we should be allowed to define our  relations with the Arabs and build economic relations with Arab  countries in all fields according to our own will. This is the  conclusion we reached. That is not all. The Israelis refused  that we establish relations even with Islamic countries. We  also reached agreement on this. Hence, we have the right to  establish economic relations with whomever we want. However, I  must be clear. There will still be some limitations on  everything we want. Phased negotiations and a good and  efficient institution will eventually lead to the restoration of  all our rights.    [Correspondent] Thank you Abu-'Ala' [Quray'].</p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / How To Spend It: Edinburgh's festival of bargains - Take a break from the arts and go shopping. Liz Joseph suggests a tour of the best Scotland's capital has to offer EVEN WITH its reputation for sound money Edinburgh actively discourages thrift in August with a range of attractive 'products' to tempt Festival shoppers. For traders, this is the pivotal point of the financial year - the make or break month. So, like the hundreds of thespians flooding into the city for the Festival and Fringe, the stores have polished up their acts. The city's shops are looking at their best and you could find that you and your money are easily seduced as that grey, douce old lady Edinburgh rouges her cheeks and hoiks up her skirts for one the world's greatest arts festivals. The discerning shopper will first visit Jenners, the oldest independent department store in the world, and then find that it pays to go off the beaten track into the many interesting by-ways. From the West End with its bustling clutter of tiny shops to the sadly rundown Royal Mile with its untidy litter of street traders, Edinburgh shows many faces. Explore the gorgeous Georgian New Town and visit Stockbridge on its northern Bohemian fringes, where so many shops specialise in the old, and then climb the Mound to the Old Town and the Grassmarket, where the new rubs shoulders with the antique. Begin in the New Town at Jenners, 48 Princes Street (031-225-2442), which has authentic tartans, cashmeres and lambswool, high fashion knitwear, as well as fine glass and china. Visit the splendid food hall which boasts Scottish shortbreads, preserves and mustards and, until September 7, A Taste of Scotland promotion offering the opportunity to taste some of the country's best foods and wines. Then head for the West End. William Street and neighbouring Stafford Street are renowned for their small delicatessens and wee shops specialising in everything from superb teas and coffees and designer labels fashions, to fresh fish and inexpensive toys, to chic little art galleries and restaurants. At the Better Beverage Company, 43 William Street (031-226-6617) David Halbert sells freshly roasted coffee from five continents, as well as a pot-pourri of teas and treats such as chocolate-coated coffee beans and teapots and coffee makers.

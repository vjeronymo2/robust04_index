			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "F-16's in Lieu of Nuclear Program -- </F> Unacceptable Deal"]    [Text] Lynn Davis, the U.S. under secretary of state, has  said the United States is ready to supply F-16 aircraft to  Pakistan on the condition that Islamabad halts its nuclear  program. The U.S. under secretary of state added that the  administration will ask Congress to lift the restrictions on  military aid so it can hand over the F-16 aircraft to Pakistan  for which payment has already been made, but in return Islamabad  will have to give assurances that it will not make any further  advances in its nuclear program.    Pakistan has repeatedly assured the international community  that its nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes, that  it does not intend to manufacture a nuclear bomb, and that it  does not harbor any aggressive designs against any country, even  though India has already exploded a nuclear device and committed  two acts of aggression against Pakistan. The United States has  maintained a policy of overlooking the nuclear programs of  India, South Africa, and Israel, but its strategy vis-a-vis  Islamic countries -- especially Pakistan -- has been to prevent  them from acquiring modern technology at all costs. When the  former Soviet Union was alive as another superpower, the U.S.  attitude was somewhat flexible; but with the disintegration of  the USSR, the United States -- swollen with pride at being the  sole superpower -- has been continuously pressuring Pakistan.  This is why it has not only approved discriminatory legislation  in the form of the Pressler Amendment, but has also refused to  deliver aircraft for which we have already made payment.    If Pakistan were situated in a peaceful region without such  a  crafty and cunning neighbor as India, it would not have needed  to start a nuclear program or spend a large chunk of its  resources on defense. Pakistan -- which has faced two  aggressions and lost half of its territory -- cannot afford to  demonstrate any weakness or enter any deal regarding its nuclear  program. The only reason India has not attacked Pakistan so  far, despite its intentions, is the nuclear deterrent. It is  also a fact that the United States has shown it is not  Pakistan's trusted friend. After the way it turned away from  Pakistan after the withdrawal of the Soviet troops and tried to  improve relations with India, it is impossible for Islamabad to  accept Washington's offer, abandon its nuclear program, and in  exchange rely on U.S. weapons or try to live with U.S. promises  that proved unreliable during the 1965 and 1971 wars.    Pakistan has forwarded several proposals to eliminate  regional tension and declare South Asia a nuclear-free zone.  These proposals have included a nonaggression treaty and a  five-nation conference that has been supported by the United  States. India, however, has never given a positive or favorable  response to these proposals, thereby proving its aggressive  designs. The United States has been pressuring Pakistan to sign  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. Pakistan is ready to  sign the NPT on the condition that India does the same. Even  this is not in Pakistan's interests, because it does not have  the strength to face India with conventional weapons. Moreover,  India is not even ready to sign the NPT. The United States has  also been pressuring Pakistan to open Kahuta and other nuclear  research centers for inspection. This is tantamount to  eliminating Pakistan's nuclear program, because the inspections  would be the same as those carried out against the Iraqi nuclear  installations, as a result of which the United States silenced  Iraq. If Washington thinks that any Pakistani Government could  remain in power after committing such a blunder, it is mistaken.  The U.S. assistant secretary of state is due to arrive in  Pakistan in a few days; the Pakistani Government must not  demonstrate any weakness in this regard.    If Washington -- ignoring the ethics of trade -- intends to  demand a quid pro quo for the delivery of those F-16 aircraft  that were paid for in cash, it is outrageous. The government  must stand firm rather than bowing to this blackmail and meet  the situation by keeping the nation informed. There is no need  to indulge in confrontation with the United States. In the  context of its national interests and regional situation,  however, Washington can be convinced that its discriminatory  attitude is harming its own interests and its image is being  tarnished in the eyes of the Islamic world. In this context,  the government should apprise the opposition of all the details  and tell the United States that we want friendship, not  submission.</p>

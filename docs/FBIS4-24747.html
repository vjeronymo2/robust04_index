			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 2 KYODO -- China held out against  implementing United Nations sanctions against North Korea on  Thursday [2 June], as the isolated communist stronghold  continued to refuse inspections of its nuclear facilities.    "The Chinese Government believes that although there are  some  difficulties for resolving this issue, there is, after all, room  and possibility for striking a proper settlement," Foreign  Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said.    "So long as the parties concerned display sincerity and hold  dialogue on an equal footing," he said, "it is possible to have  these difficulties overcome."    Shen refused to say whether China would use its veto to  block  other UN Security Council members from implementing sanctions,  but indicated they were opposed to heavy-handed sanctions.    "At this time, we do not favor a resort to means that might  sharpen the confrontation," he said while calling on the parties  involved to "remain calm."    North Korea has been involved in a 16-month confrontation  with the International Atomic Energy Agency and the U.S. over  verification of its suspected nuclear weapons program.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak said  views from other ministries such as the Commerce Ministry are  needed to decide on curbs to privileges granted to the United  States. This will be based on conditions ratified under the GATT  agreements which stipulate equal treatment for all countries  that are members of the World Trade Organization. He said that  governments in the past have solved the problem through the  liberalization of various kinds of businesses.    [Begin Suphachai recording] It is our intention. The  removal of clauses under the Amity Treaty from the National  Executive Council Announcement No 281 is due to the fact under  Announcement No 281, we have to treat every country equally.  This is because of the agreements of the World Trade  Organization, as we are a member of the organization, and so is  the United States. The United States must understand this very  well, and there should not be any problem. As for the next  step, we will have to clarify with the United States that in  future, it won't be the only country that enjoys all those  special privileges. [End recording]</p>

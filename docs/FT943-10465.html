			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures had a dull but volatile session as the market paused for breath following Tuesday's strong showing, writes Joel Kibazo. The first trade in the September contract on the FT-SE 100 was struck at 3,177, some 6 points below its previous close but at a healthy premium to cash. Strong profit-taking in the first hour of trading saw the contract retreat to 3,164, the day's low, for the first of two occasions before bargain hunting stopped the slide. The rally that followed took the contract to a peak of 3,184 before another bout of selling once again sent it to the day's low. The weak opening on Wall Street only encouraged further selling of September. It finished at 3,175, down 8 from its previous session but at a 16-point premium to cash. Volume was very poor at 8,149 lots. Dealers said the December contract had been trading a point above its fair value premium of 12 points, an indication of confidence in the contract. Active dealing in the stock options brought improved turnover in the traded options sector. Volume at the close was 36,649 contracts, of which 10,584 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 2,155 in the Euro FT-SE option. Tesco was the busiest stock option with 3,370 lots dealt. National power and Argyll Group were also active.</p>

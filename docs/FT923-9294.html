			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Buy-out at Robertson arm A GROUP of present and former employees has acquired the minerals consulting and minerals processing laboratory business of the Robertson Group for an undisclosed sum. Robertson was acquired for Pounds 52m by Simon Engineering in April last year. The buy-out group is headed by Mr Malcolm Clews, who between 1984 and 1988 headed Robertson's minerals consultancy business. He said he had been working since autumn 1990 to arrange the purchase. The revamped organisation is called Robertson Research Minerals, which he claims is one of the largest integrated independent minerals consultancies in Europe. RRM has acquired all the data archive collected during Robertson Research's 30 years of operations. Current projects include providing advice to the UN Development programme in the Yemen and two gold projects in Uzbekistan for Canadian clients.</p>

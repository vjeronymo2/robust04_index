			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Inkatha leader spurns elections Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's conservative Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party said yesterday it would not take part in South Africa's first all-race elections in April, Reuter reports from Durban. The African National Congress, Inkatha's bitter rival, is widely tipped to win the elections. Inkatha has been aligned with some right-wing parties opposed to the elections.</p>

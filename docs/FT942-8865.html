			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: BHP served another environment writ Broken Hill Propriety, the Australian resources group, has received another writ alleging environmental damage from its Ok Tedi gold-copper mine in Papua New Guinea. The writ was lodged in the Victorian Supreme Court by Mr Barry Shackles. He claims that damage from the Ok Tedi project has reduced profits of a Daru-based fishing business. The writ follows the launch earlier this month of Australia's most expensive court action, an estimated ADollars 4bn (USDollars 2.8bn) claim on behalf of landowners near the Ok Tedi river alleging environmental damage from the BHP-controlled operation. Both writs are being handled by Slater and Gordon of Melbourne. CRA, the Australian mining group, has rejected allegations that it misled shareholders in its 1990 takeover battle for Kalimantan Gold, operator of the Kelian gold mine in Indonesia. CRA was responding to legal action launched in the Supreme Court of Victoria on Monday. Five former corporate shareholders in Kalimantan are seeking unspecified damages from the company.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lajos Horvath, cochairman of the Hungarian </F> Justice and Life Party, by Lajos Pogonyi; place and date not  given: "The Proof of the Pudding Is in the Eating in Politics  Too"]    [Text] [Pogonyi] Several leaders of the Hungarian Justice  and Life Party [MIEP], including Istvan Csurka, said recently  that, against the left and the liberals, you are ready to make  peace with the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], a party that is  prone to shift to the left sometimes.    [Horvath] What the MDF did in its government activity helped  the left and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] to come into  their own. The Marxists who used to castigate private property  before, became capitalists and large-scale land owners under the  MDF government.    [Pogonyi] I do not understand. You mean they became large-  scale land owners?    [Horvath] Yes, by purchasing huge areas in the course of the  compensation process. On the basis of their acts, we must say  that the MDF-government also served the interests of the left.  We now expect the MDF to give up this activity, and then we  might be able to talk to each other.    [Pogonyi] I heard and saw in one of the political film clips  of the MIEP recently that your party is the one that is  consistently carrying out the Lakitelek program.    [Horvath] We would like to suggest by this that we accepted  the third way, the national solution.    [Pogonyi] Is the "leftist and liberal danger" so big in  Hungary that you are ready to reconcile with the MDF?    [Horvath] I do not think that this would be a reconciliation  between the MIEP and the MDF. The matter is that the leftist  and liberal bloc is our common enemy, a bloc that perhaps does  not have so much chance in the elections as it tries to project.  In any case, they are greater enemies of the MIEP than the MDF  or other national parties.    [Pogonyi] If I am correct, Peter Boross said recently that  the MDF would not form a coalition with the MIEP in any  circumstances....    [Horvath] I do not know if he formulated this so firmly. We  would not form a coalition with today's MDF either. In other  words, if this is the way the present MDF is talking about us,  we do not see anything special in this.    [Pogonyi] Your faction colleague in Parliament, Janos Denes,  said recently that cosmopolitan liberalism is an ugly twin of  communism. Please comment on this statement. What should we  understand by this?    [Horvath] There is a very interesting American writer who  wrote a book entitled "The Uncovered Capitalist." In its  introduction, the author states that the communist conspiracy is  only a tiny part of the global conspiracy. His arguments are  quite convincing to me. The new world order tried to infiltrate  the cells of Eastern Europe through Marxist internationalism.  It failed, and now it is trying a different approach.    [Pogonyi] So it is not true what Peter Boross claims, namely  that while the elections will be decided between the MDF and the  MSZP, the liberal parties will fall off.    [Horvath] Although I cannot predict things the way Mr Boross  can, but there is no problem whatsoever with the liberals.  There are huge differences between the liberals.    [Pogonyi] For example?    [Horvath] There is a big difference between real liberalism  and sham-liberalism.    [Pogonyi] Could you give an example of the latter?    [Horvath] For example, the present SZDSZ is such a pseudo  liberal party which openly flirts with the old system and the  communist and socialist parties. However, there is a tiny  amount of liberalism in which we can find at least the seeds of  national liberalism.    [Pogonyi] Are you perhaps talking about the Federation of  Young Democrats [Fidesz]?    [Horvath] Yes, about the Fidesz.    [Pogonyi] If I recall correctly, the Fidesz has only been  lately claiming to be a nationally commited party and a  moderately liberal, center-like people's party.    [Horvath] Yes, but all this sounds more genuine since the  well-known personnel changes that have taken place in the party.  Of course, the proof of the pudding is in the eating.    [Pogonyi] Speaking about the pudding and eating, will the  MIEP get the 5 percent necessary for making it into Parliament?    [Horvath] Yes, it will. Regarding the number of voters, we  succeeded in presenting lists in two-thirds of the country. We  have a total of 70 individual candidates and 12 territorial  lists.    [Pogonyi] What is your opinion about the fact that Izabella  B. Kiraly's Hungarian Interest Party is almost nowhere before  the elections?    [Horvath] I was quite certain about this.    [Pogonyi] And now a little about foreign policy: Istvan  Csurka rejoiced at the victory of the Forza Italia in the  Italian elections. In your opinion, will this be a lasting  delight?    [Horvath] We do not yet know what kind of force the Forza  Italia represents, but we do know that it occupies a position in  Italian politics similar to our position in Hungarian politics.  Istvan Csurka and I signed the telegram in which we greeted  them. We regard the Forza Italia as a force that firmly opposes  the left and rejects the half-heartedness of the center parties.    [Pogonyi] Were you offended by Zhirinovskiy's failure to  invite you to the congress of his Liberal Democratic Party?    [Horvath] Zhirinovskiy and his party invited everyone,  including the MDF and even Izabella B. Kiraly. We not only  refrained from replying to him but also refrained from  publishing the invitation in the press.    [Pogonyi] Why? It might have been unpleasant?    [Horvath] We consider the whole thing to be irresponsible.  We regard Zhirinosvkiy as a dangerous politician of unclear  roots, who is famous for his scandals, and not for his wisdom.    [Pogonyi] An obligatory concluding question: With what  party would the MIEP form a coalition?    [Horvath] Regarding its political commitment, the  Independent Smallholders' Party is the closest to us, just like  most of the core of the Christian Democratic People's Party  [KDNP].    [Pogonyi] The radical Mikloses? Miklos Gaspar, Miklos  Lukacs, and Miklos Hasznos?    [Horvath] I will not mention names, in order to avoid  arguments or internal tension. We are talking about the marked,  radical, and Christian right-wing group in the KDNP.</p>

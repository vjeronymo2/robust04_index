			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Dutch Sunday newspaper closes The Netherlands' only Sunday newspaper has folded after just 23 issues, marking the failure of the second attempt in 30 months to persuade the Dutch to acquire the habit of reading a Sunday newspaper, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam. HP/De Tijd op Zondag blamed lack of advertising for its demise. The newspaper, which had 55,000 subscribers, faced high costs because of a union ban on Sunday printing that forced it to print in Belgium.</p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW DRIFTS DOWN 3.42 ON QUIET TRADING DAY  </P> <P> Stock prices posted a small loss today in a drifting session. Trading was  quiet.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial average fell 3.42 points to 2,683.89. In the broader  market declining issues narrowly led advances.  </P> <P> Volume on the big board was slow, with only 137.7 million shares trading hands.  </P> <P> Brokers noted uneasiness over the market's uninspired showing Tuesday, when the  Dow Jones industrials gave up a gain of about 10 points to finish slightly  lower.  </P> <P> That represented a sluggish response to the news that the consumer price index  held steady in August, providing fresh encouragement on the inflation outlook.  </P> <P> The Federal Reserve Board's "beige book" on current economic trends showed the  nation's economy is advancing at a slow to modest rate with substantial  regional variation.  </P> <P> Traders said that report had little impact on the market.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bond Prices Slip  </P> <P> Bond prices fell in early trading today in tandem with a slumping dollar.  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond slipped 3/16 point, or $1.88 per $1,000  face amount, while its yield, which rises when prices fall, increased to 8.10%  from 8.09% late Tuesday.  </P> <P> The dollar weakened on reports that the Group of Seven industrialized nations  was planning stronger efforts to lower the dollar's value or put a ceiling on  its rise. The dollar was also hurt by reports of an increase in some West  German interest rates, which would tend to attract money to marks.  </P> <P> With little else for traders to focus on, the dollar's dip drew bond prices  lower, said Elizabeth G. Reiners, a vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.  In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments  fell 1/8 point, intermediate maturities fell 1/16 point and long-term issues  were down almost 1/4 point, according to Telerate Inc., the financial  information service.  </P> <P> The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond  with a $1,000 face value.  </P> <P> The Federal Reserve injected reserves into the banking system, but the step was  regarded as a technical move to relieve upward pressure on the federal funds  rate at the end of a two-week reserve measurement period.  </P> <P> The Fed stepped in when federal funds were trading at 9 3/8%, above the central  bank's goal of around 9%. In spite of the step, the federal funds rate, which  is the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted later at 9 1/2%,  up from 8 7/8% late Tuesday.  </P> <P> The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price  movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or  longer, fell 1.95 to 1,180.11.  </P> <P> Moody's investment grade corporate bond index, which measures total return on a  portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, fell  0.33 to 331.86.  </P> <P> Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.02% as the discount rose 4 basis  points to 7.76%. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.11% as the discount rose 3  basis points to 7.70%. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.14% as the discount  rose 6 basis points to 7.60%.  </P> <P> A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the  annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the  percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at  maturity.  </P></p>

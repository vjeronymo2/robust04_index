			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Airbus airliner crashes on test Seven Airbus crew members including the European consortium chief test pilot, Mr Nick Warner, were killed yesterday when a new Airbus A330 wide-bodied jet crashed during tests at Toulouse airport. The twin-engine 350-seat airliner went down shortly after take-off while the crew were testing the auto-pilot system after a simulated engine failure. The test was being conducted in extreme conditions with the aircraft on a steep angle of climb and flying at very low speed. It is the first time an A330 has crashed. There are six in airline service, with Air Inter, the French domestic carrier, and Aer Lingus, the Irish flag carrier. All are powered by General Electric engines. The crashed airliner had Pratt and Whitney engines. Airbus said last night the two black box flight recorders had been found. Two Britons were among the crew members killed yesterday. Three Frenchmen and two Italians also died. The A330 first went into airline service last year and Airbus has so far won total orders for 118.</p>

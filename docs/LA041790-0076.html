			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL ROUNDUP: PINKERTON'S RIVAL SUES OVER PERSONALITY TEST  </P> <P> Pinkerton's Inc., a large security guard company based in Van Nuys, said it was  sued by rival Guardsmark Inc., which alleged that Pinkerton's engaged in unfair  and deceptive trade practices.  </P> <P> The suit reportedly stems from Pinkerton's use of a "personality assessment"  test used to screen security guards. Guardsmark, a security services concern  based in Memphis, Tenn., claimed it has licensed the test from the University  of Minnesota and that Pinkerton's is not licensed.  </P> <P> Guardsmark's suit seeks to stop Pinkerton's from using the test or advertising  its testing program.  </P> <P> "We believe this lawsuit to be entirely without merit," Gerard S. Brown,  Pinkerton's executive vice president and general counsel, said in a statement.  </P></p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / PowerGen flags big dividend rises POWERGEN, the electricity generator, yesterday announced a change in its dividend policy which could spell annual rises of at least 15 per cent. It also declared an 18 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 425m on turnover up 3 per cent to Pounds 3.19bn. Sir Graham Day, chairman, said the company would reduce its dividend cover 'over the next two to three years towards 2.5 to 2.7 times'. The current figure is nearly 3.5 times after an 18 per cent rise in earnings per share to 36.5p and a total dividend of 10.5p, up 13.5 per cent. Mr Bill Dale, utilities analyst at SG Warburg Securities, said annual dividend rises of 19 per cent were in prospect for the next three years: 'It could easily be in the 20s.' Shares in PowerGen rose 12.5p to 368p. National Power, the other main generator, gained 9p to 353p on hopes it would follow suit on dividends. PowerGen's improved profitability was helped by the company becoming the largest single supplier to the competitive, non- franchise market of large industrial and commercial customers. Sales increased by 42 per cent to more than 17 terrawatt hours, and the company expects a 10 per cent advance this year. A considerable reduction was made in operating costs. Salaries and overheads were down by Pounds 191m to Pounds 563m and the number of employees fell 1,100 to 4,900. This compares with more than 9,000 three years ago. Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive, said the dividend policy change had been made possible by the removal of several uncertainties, including the completion of the coal review and the signing of five-year coal contracts. 'The white paper did not change anything,' he said. 'The government decided we could continue to make our own decisions.' On the level of strategic coal stocks that should be held by the generators, PowerGen thought 4m tonnes was about right, against current stocks of 15.5m tonnes. Mr Wallis said it was unlikely PowerGen and National Power would be referred by the electricity regulator to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission: 'Stephen Littlechild will want to say 'look at what I have done' rather than 'look at what the MMC has done'.' The likelihood of a reference was also diminished by the decline in PowerGen's market share. Mr Wallis said this could fall to about 22 per cent by 1997-98, against 29 per cent last year. The construction of 3,000 MW of gas-fired electricity would mean the fall in its market share would be less sharp than would otherwise be the case. Mr Wallis said he did not see a long term future for High Marnham and Drakelow power stations. Offers for them would be considered. Lex Page 18</p>

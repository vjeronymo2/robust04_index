			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> BENITEZ DANCERS  </P> <P> Flaring nostrils, creased brows and heel-stamping drama may be enough for other  Spanish dancers -- not Maria Benitez.  </P> <P> When she and her chamber-sized company began a three-night stint Wednesday at  the Japan America Theatre, they banished any notions of cliche. To be sure  their show had the de rigueur intensity and allure -- a cantaor cried his song  of anguish, two guitarists strummed a mighty roar and the dancers boasted  commanding personalities.  </P> <P> But none of what they did was 2-dimensional. For the art of the dance as  defined by Benitez involves utmost subtlety -- the kind that comes from the  full employment of the body, not just authoritative carriage, picturesque  profiles and rhythmic vigor.  </P> <P> Her hands, for instance, do not simply punctuate the air overhead, they swivel  from the wrist in stunning, voluptuous rotations. Nor are any movements  isolated; instead there is a fluid ever-evolving line. And her locomotion is so  smooth that she seems to glide cross-stage while executing heel-work of  incremental variety.  </P> <P> Although Benitez's company falls into a traditional category, her dances are  somewhat stylized. Low lights and dim spots on the four women and one man  projected a mysteriously somber opening scene. During a solo the others become  a ghostly chorus. In the final number, a flamenco suite, she abandons feminine  dress in favor of high-waisted black pants.  </P> <P> A zarzuela excerpt (taped music by Albeniz) rounded out a program high in  virtuosity.

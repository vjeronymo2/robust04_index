[Shevchuk] Your Eminence, in one of your first interviews  after your election as the First Hierarch of the Ukrainian  Orthodox Church by the Synod of Bishops in Kharkov, you said  that you were returning to Ukraine to serve the interests of  your people. What is behind these words now, a year and a half  since?    [Sabodan] Our church of Christ has only one goal--to devote  all of its efforts to the people among whom we live and whom we  humbly serve.    Of course, tragic events have broken out in Ukraine in  conjunction with the emergence of three branches of Orthodoxy.  Many complications have resulted from two patriarchates and two  patriarchs existing now. This is indeed affecting our relations.  However, we must labor, pray, and be concerned about our people  for the Lord to unite us, for accord and peace to prevail in the  territory of Ukraine.    [Shevchuk] Could you tell us briefly about what your church  amounts to at present?    [Sabodan] We have 6,000 parishes, 5,000 clergymen, 49  monasteries and convents, 12 theological seminaries that train  cadres for ministry, 28 dioceses, and 30 bishops.    We favor the acquisition of the status of a national  Orthodox  church by our church; at present, 15 such churches exist in the  world. We should also take into account the mood of the people,  who are now tense and frightened with these divisions,  unifications, and separations. Unfortunately, the very word  "autocephaly" has been compromised. We have yet to work with the  clergy, the monks, and our lay members for them to understand  that the path to a national church is natural. Other churches,  which are currently independent, have also traveled it.    We have already repeated our point of view many times--this  is about an autonomous, independent church; this must be done  through an expression of the will of not just the bishops, but  also the clergy and the believers. Otherwise, an even sadder  split will result than the one we already have.    [Shevchuk] What is your connection with the Moscow  Patriarchate at present?    [Sabodan] We are an independent, self-governing part of the  Russian Orthodox Church. It is just that, in keeping with the  statute, we refer to the name of the Most Holy Patriarch Oleksiy  during the high mass. We are thus united with other national  churches.    The Holy Synod leads our church entirely and completely. The  patriarch does not interfere in our affairs on any issue.  Recently, he even sent us a letter in which he stated that  neither the Patriarchate nor he personally has any claim to  either the church lands in the territory of Ukraine or the  property and buildings. He testified: All that the Ukrainian  Orthodox Church got over a millennium is its acquired property,  and it will be the master of it.    [Shevchuk] To your mind, are there any prospects for coming  together in a United Orthodox Church? Is something being done to  this end by both parties?    [Sabodan] We have to put our faith in God, because only God,  rather than the people, may unite that which is disunited, and  save that which is perishing.    We now have aggravated relations with the Kiev Patriarchate,  or more precisely, there are no relations. There have been  attempts at the level of laymen, and they have not worked out.  There have been attempts at the level of the clergy and  theologians, which, unfortunately, have not been crowned with  success, either. We will wait....    [Shevchuk] We have happened to hear repeatedly from the Kiev  Patriarchate that it has turned to you with a special appeal  concerning unification but that you have not responded to this,  and have, allegedly, refused to engage in any dialogue.    [Sabodan] Nobody has sent any appeals officially. There was  an official invitation to the All-Ukrainian Church Council,  which was held in October. However, we could not attend it. We  have our own canonic principles, apostolical rules with regard  to relations and joint prayer. Therefore, all of this has not  been due to some whim.    Sometimes they accuse me of being ambitious, of allegedly  wanting something special. I do not have any ambitions. I do not  have a life other than that of the church, and I think I will  not have one until I die. I was elected by the bishops, the  people ratified this at the council, and I see my mission as  doing everything for the Holy Church that I am capable of to the  full extent of my energies.    [Shevchuk] Your Eminence, is it true that in the offices "on  high" it was proposed to you to unite and to head the Ukrainian  Orthodoxy?    [Sabodan] There was such a conversation. Just break with  Moscow and take over everything. However, as I understand it,  and not I alone, but the totality of our Ukrainian Orthodox  Church, anything at all may be proclaimed, and we may break with  anyone at all, but if there is to be a serious discussion of the  future of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, of all Orthodoxy in  Ukraine, this should be done in a legitimate manner. Our church  should be recognized by all local Orthodox churches.    [Shevchuk] Your Eminence, we would like to hear specifically  from your lips why your church, in essence, failed to take part  in the commemoration of the famine in Ukraine. After all, this  fact has caused indignation in certain circles and is still  being variously interpreted....    [Sabodan] Indeed, there were such interpretations. We were  accused of boycotting the commemoration of this event. This is  not true. At the time, I was on a business trip abroad, but  three of our metropolitans, members of the Synod, were present  both in the Ukraine Palace and at the memorial rally.    This has to do with the arrangement we made: We would come  onto this stand, but on the condition that this would be a rally  rather than worship. When they saw that Filaret, who had been  defrocked, proceeded in the capacity of an archpriest and  actually led the prayers, our bishops did not come to the  podium, because this was, as a matter of fact, a divine service.    We commemorated this sad event in all dioceses. I issued an  epistle. Therefore, we did take part, and we are pure before God  and the people.    [Shevchuk] By the way, your priests frequently repeat that  the Kiev Patriarchate and its clergy are not canonic. In turn,  the latter call you noncanonic. They say that the bishops of the  Moscow Patriarchate have been ordained with the blessing of the  KGB and communist propaganda.... To tell you the truth, it is  not that easy to sort this out from the outside. What would you  say about this?    [Sabodan] The now late Patriarch Mstyslav did not recognize  the creation of this association, of this new church structure  in Ukraine, although they consider themselves his followers.    What about the specifics of apostolic rules? Yes, to us this  is a noncanonic church, and we say this for a reason. Not a  single church in the world has recognized the Kiev Patriarchate  as a legitimate, canonic church. These are not my conclusions,  but rather the reality of life.    [Shevchuk] And what about the assertions of the Kiev  Patriarchate?    [Sabodan] Everyone defends himself. Inquire with them.  However, it is necessary to have courage and call things by  their names.    [Shevchuk] Here is one more aspect. Representatives of the  Kiev Patriarchate say that you have illegally seized  monasteries, in particular, the Kiev-Pechora Lavra, and that  quite recently you tried to take the Feodosiya Church forcibly.  Does this conform to the truth?    [Sabodan] Together with the people, we consider  ourselves--and this is the case--the followers of the church  that was created by Prince Volodymyr--the Russian Orthodox  Church of ancient Rus. We did not take anything away--we came as  successors. Nobody seized the Lavra; it is just that  Metropolitan Filaret was not allowed to enter it after he was  defrocked.    What about the dioceses? At present, it is the practice  precisely of the Kiev Patriarchate to seize our churches. For  example, they recently seized one in Chernovtsy, and there was  an attempt in the Rovno area.... The Church of Intercession at  Solomyanka was taken from us illegally....    As far as the Feodosiya Church is concerned, this is how it  was. On the morning of 27 December, Archimandrite Valentin, the  secretary of Metropolitan Antoniy (Masendych) and eight of the  monks, who represented the monastery, came to me and brought all  documents and the seal: "We ask to be admitted to the Lavra...."  They said: The UNSO [Ukrainian People's Self-Defense Forces]  came by the day before, we cannot endure. I told them that we  would not display any aggressiveness. If they wanted to remain  at the monastery and become members of the Ukrainian Orthodox  Church in a canonic manner, through penitence, they were welcome  to. Then they began to ask that at least someone accompany them.  Several monks agreed. They were shown the premises and the  chattels; however, we did not intend to have something signed  over in a protocol. They held a supplication service at the  church and went their own ways.    In the middle of the day, 20 priests of the Kiev  Patriarchate  came: Where are the Russkies, what did they do here? And they  closed the church. This is how it all ended. We did not intend  to seize it. This is not our position. This is not the way of  the church, although our people make many complaints to me:  Enough of being silent, they say, we should storm it....  Everybody, beginning with the bishops, accuses me of passivity,  of not provoking some kind of aggression. They say that we  should meet violence with violence. However, an  interdenominational war would begin in that case. God forbid. I  do not want to be involved....    [Shevchuk] Your Eminence, what is your assessment of the  withdrawal of five bishops from the Ukrainian Orthodox  Church-Kiev Patriarchate and their switch to your church, which  has already been publicized in the press, especially of  Metropolitan Antoniy (Masendych), the administrator of affairs  of the Kiev Patriarchate, who had started out in the UAPTs  [Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]?    [Sabodan] As far as Metropolitan Antoniy is concerned, he  has  not approached us--neither me personally nor our Church. He has  not asked in writing or verbally to be accepted. I do not know  his whereabouts. VECHIRNIY KYYIV reported that he has been  assigned to the Saratov Diocese. This is not true.    Four bishops have approached us: of Vinnitsa--Spyrydon, of  Kharkov and Poltava--Roman, of Zhytomir and Ovruch--Sofroniy,  and of Yagotin--Ioan. We accepted the last two.    [Shevchuk] Your Eminence, to tell you the truth, I did not  expect you to give this interview in the Ukrainian language. It  is a pleasure to hear it from you. A question in conjunction  with this: Why is then instruction offered in Russian in  theological seminaries in which the boys are, for the most part,  from rural areas?    [Sabodan] Subjects such as the history of Ukraine and the  history of the Bible are taught in Ukrainian, but there are  problems. It is not easy to provide textbooks in Ukrainian for  the process of instruction within a short period of time.  However, we are working on this, and we will gradually switch to  Ukrainian....    [Shevchuk] Why do your priests preach in Russian in the  rural  churches? What is this, a requirement?    [Sabodan] Precisely, a decision was made by the Synod last  year: Where the people want it, where the majority accepts the  Ukrainian language as that of the service--go ahead....    [Shevchuk] What would you like to say in summation of our  conversation?    [Sabodan] I have already told you: We should pray primarily  for them to see the light, so that there will not be these acts  of violence in which some people's deputies got involved and  still get involved, beginning with the famous decision whereby  the Supreme Council determines what is or is not canonic in the  Orthodox Church. For example, is the Kharkov Council canonic or  not? It would be ridiculous if it were not so serious. This  cannot happen in any civilized state.    Now there is the decision about having services alternately.  This is a new conflict; this will not happen without violence.  It is precisely the interference from deputies, especially in  Volyn and the Rovno area, that brings about a terrible fight and  anger among the people.    If such interference from the state continues, nothing good  will come out of it; it will be a calamity for our Ukrainian  people, who are facing so many problems--moral, ethical,  cultural, and political--to begin with. What if there also is a  calamity in the church? Unfortunately, as a matter of fact, it  already exists....    I would like to finish this conversation of ours with the  wish that God might enlighten our government and all of us, the  people in and outside of the Church, so that the method of  violence be eliminated from our lives altogether, because it  will bring about horrible things. Then it will be too late....  If it is resolved by violence, I, for one, will have difficulty  continuing to hold back our people. They will not listen to me  at all.    [Shevchuk] Well, thank you for the statements that we heard  from the horse's mouth. It is possible that some of the  questions were not quite pleasant for you, but I believe they  are timely. Our present-day life and our readers bring them up.</p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Cheer for the builders A BUILDING sector bracing itself for a series of profits setbacks and dividend cuts during the new trading account was given a shot in the arm by better than expected interim results from Rugby, the cement group. The good figures saw Rugby shares advance 9, or some 5.6 per cent, to 169p, one of the best individual performances yesterday in the stock market. The profits increase, a rare achievement by a building company over the past two years, prompted analysts to raise their full-year expectations. Mr Robin Hardy at Panmure Gordon lifted his forecast for the current year to Pounds 56.78m and that for the following year to Pounds 59m. The Panmure analyst said: 'If the building materials have a strong run, then Rugby, with its good spread of interests, net cash and good strategy, will be at the head of the pack.' Drug stocks firm Pharmaceuticals group SmithKline Beecham gained ground, helped by a positive note from a securities house. The shares, up 11 at one stage, closed a net 7 ahead at 473p. The sector in general was firmer, benefiting ahead of forthcoming results and a drug conference this week. Mr Martin Hall of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew raised his forecast for 1993 profits to Pounds 1.32bn from Pounds 1.28bn and published a note pointing out the combined effect of a number of company announcements this year of drug approvals, launches and promotion agreements. UBS said the SmithKline upgrade also reflected better than expected sales of the company's anti-emetic drug Kytril in Japan and its anti-arthritis treatment Relafen in the US. Mr Hall said the impact on 1992 profits would be held back by heavy marketing and launch costs. As a result he maintained his current year forecast of Pounds 1.14bn. Glaxo, which has results due for release on Thursday and is to discuss its anti-migraine drug Imigran in London today, climbed 15 to 764p. Wellcome, reinstated on Merrill Lynch's buy list, improved 18 to 844p. Some analysts said sentiment towards the sector was positive due to its defensive qualities during economic downturn and as investors looked to increase their exposure to dollar-earning stocks on the possibility of recovery in the US currency. However, there is also the view that UK drug shares are relatively expensive versus Wall Street and that outperformance is limited. SG Warburg shares were chased higher, closing 13 ahead at 439p, after weekend press suggestions that the stock may be inserted in the FT-SE 100 Index. An agency cross of 3m shares at 202p prompted a sharp decline in London &amp; Manchester, the life group, which ended 9 lower at 206p. A stock shortage drove Commercial Union up 10 to 475p and General Accident 12 ahead to 443p. The good results released by Rugby prompted a brief burst of buying interest in Redland, which rose to 371p before ending a net 8 to the good at 368p. Blue Circle Industries, on the other hand, suffered a decline of 5 to 155p on keen turnover of 1.2m shares after bearish stories on the dividend, said to have emanated from Smith New Court, the stockbroker. BCI is scheduled to produce interims on Thursday, with profits expected to have dropped from last time's Pounds 81m to Pounds 35.5m. Building materials group Hepworth was also given a rough passage yesterday, the shares plummeting 20 to 243p after hints that Kleinwort Benson Securities had sharply downgraded its estimates. Last week Kleinwort pulled the rug from underneath Tarmac shares after a very bearish review of the company's earnings and dividend prospects. Building specialists said the real bad news from the industry would kick off this morning when George Wimpey will unveil its half-time figures. The market expects the company to at least halve its interim dividend, from 4p to 2p, and to reveal losses of around Pounds 10m, against a profit of Pounds 200,000 in the same period last year. Specialists warned of substantial provisions against loss-making contracts and land. Wimpey slipped 2 more to 77p, easily the lowest level since the mid-1980s. Hopes that British Aerospace would soon announce new orders were the spur to the day's trading in the stock. The shares put on 6 to 219p as just in excess of 1m shares were dealt. Financial worries overhung Eurotunnel, which receded 15 to 365p. Dividend concern surrounding P &amp; O appears to have faded and a squeeze in the stock left it 8 up at 359p. Plastics manufacturer British Vita fell 6 to 219p after weaker than expected first-half results. Furniture group MFI lost 6 to 102p, with UBS Philips &amp; Drew reported to have downgraded the stock. The securities house is believed to have shaved Pounds 15m off its current-year figure to Pounds 60m. Kingfisher was in demand, firming 7 to 441p, boosted by a recommendation from SG Warburg, the company's broker, and County NatWest, which advised investors to switch into Kingfisher and out of WH Smith. County said Smith, which closed at 402p ex-dividend, has recently outperformed the market. A continuing overhang of stock left United Biscuits 6 weaker at 260p. A strong run for Unilever was checked as profit-takers moved in and took the shares down 5 to 925p. A shortage of Reed International shares squeezed them 13 higher to 511p, helped by a recommendation from BZW. The house's media team told clients that it felt Reed and Emap offered good exposure to the recovery potential of the sector. Support ahead of today's interim results saw Medeva improve 17 to 198p. The market is looking for profits of between Pounds 12.2m and Pounds 15m, against Pounds 5.05m last year. Fisons, which also reports today, eased a penny to 174p. First-half profits are expected to come in at between Pounds 35m and Pounds 43m. Further reflection on last week's results continued to make Ladbroke a busy market and turnover reached 3.8m as the shares put on 5 to 155p. In hotels, sellers were seen in Stakis, where turnover rose to 5.1m as the shares relinquished 2 to 25p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (10).

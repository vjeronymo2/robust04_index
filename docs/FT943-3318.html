			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Kingfisher weak Stores group Kingfisher failed to impress with first-half figures at the bottom end of expectations but the shares held firm on the 'Only Way Is Up' theory. Forecasts for the full year were lowered, although some of the more positive analysts argued that all the problems were now in the share price. UBS, for example, reduced its estimate by Pounds 12m to Pounds 333m but remained a buyer on the basis that 'the massive derating seen since Christmas is probably now at an end'. Hoare Govett lowered its forecast by Pounds 15m to Pounds 325m and appeared to be maintaining a hold on the stock. BZW, which has taken a consistently bearish stance, came down by only Pounds 5m to Pounds 335m. However, analyst Mr Tony Shiret remained a strong seller and pinpointed the threat to Kingfisher's B&amp;Q chain from Home Depot, of the US. Some analysts maintained the belief that at least one senior management change was imminent in spite of a firm denial by the company yesterday. The shares fell 23 at the start of trading but rallied to close only 3 down at 487p. A buy recommendation from BZW, plus talk of aggressive switching from other composite insurance stocks, drove Royal Insurance sharply better. There was also talk around the market that a big US buyer had been operating, although some dealers thought this unlikely because of Royal's exposure to environmental claims in the US. At the close, Royal stock was 9 higher at 290p after good turnover of 3.6m shares. Talk of a sell recommendation from one of the market's leading brokers and a revival of rights issue stories unsettled Forte, 3 lower at 228p. Speculation was that Forte may pay in excess of Pounds 200m for Meridian, the hotels group owned by Air France, and also take advantage of the acquisition to launch a big rights issue to reduce its debt. Granada was also affected by rumours that the group could be contemplating a sizeable acquisition and had been taking soundings from its shareholders. Granada shares declined 8 to 487p. Norweb was one of the better performers in the utilities sectors, the stock edging up 2 to 794p after the company sent its broker, Smith New Court, into the market to buy its own shares. Norweb purchased 5m shares, or 2.9 per cent of its issued capital, at 795p. South Western also moved in to acquire more of its own stock, buying 500,000 shares at 766p. Smith New Court was responsible for keeping the Scottish generators on an even keel. The broker's utilities team said the Scots 'should have prospects as good as the 'recs' after their distribution review; Hydro-Electric will be able to pay 10 per cent real dividend growth until 2,000 and Power should be able to match this. Hydro slipped 3 to 372p and Power held at 382p. At least two of the market's most influential broking houses, Kleinwort Benson and Credit Lyonnais Laing, were said to be recommending a big switch from National Westminster to Barclays. The latter held at 595p on 6.6m traded and the former dropped 17 to 494p on 6.3m dealt. The building sectors had a rough ride again as dealers focused on the implications of higher domestic interest rates. NatWest Securities' building team said: 'With September a key selling month for housebuilders, the rise in base rates could not have been timed more badly.' Taylor Woodrow failed to hold an early gain inspired by better than expected interim profits, which were around Pounds 2m higher than best estimates. The share price settled 2 easier at 135p, after 142p. Caradon, the building products group, was one of the FT-SE 100's best performers, racing up 11 to 298p after top-of-the-range interim figures. The latest newspaper circulation figures knocked Daily Express parent United Newspapers, which fell 17 to 511p. Other statistics, Page 37</p>

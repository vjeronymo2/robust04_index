			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: Akzo posts first rise this year AKZO, the Dutch chemicals group, reported a small increase in third-quarter net profit before extraordinary items. It was the company's first quarterly rise posted so far in 1993. Net profit before extraordinary items rose to Fl 169m (Dollars 89m) from Fl 162.1m a year earlier, on turnover up 3 per cent at Fl 4.1bn. The company is to pay an unchanged interim dividend of Fl 1.50. Akzo took Fl 55m in extraordinary charges in the third quarter, mainly to pay for the recent spinning off of loss-making businesses into joint ventures with other companies. If extraordinary charges are included, net profit fell to Fl 113.9m from Fl 162.1m. Mr Syb Bergsma, Akzo's finance director, said fourth-quarter net profit before extraordinary items was also expected to show a rise. 'We may have to show further extraordinary losses in the fourth quarter. If so, they will be lower than in the third quarter,' he said. He described third-quarter operating profit, which was steady at Fl 260m, as 'not unsatisfactory', given current economic conditions. Akzo's chemicals, coatings and pharmaceuticals businesses all posted increases in operating profit but the group's fibres business fell into an operating loss.</p>

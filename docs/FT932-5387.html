			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Inquiry to probe ship collision AN official inquiry is to be launched into the tanker collision off the Belgian coast which killed nine people early yesterday morning and brought renewed calls for greater safety at sea. British Petroleum, the tanker's owner, will conduct a separate investigation. The British Trent, leaving Antwerp with a 24,000-tonne cargo of petrol, collided with the Panamanian-registered bulk carrier Western Winner in thick fog eight miles off the coast. The tanker's hull was punctured, releasing blazing petrol into the sea. Although many crewmen swam to safety, seven were burned to death and two are missing, believed dead. Petrol leaking into the sea prompted environmental concerns, but BP said it would burn off or evaporate. The Bermuda-registered British Trent had 12 European officers, including a British master, and 17 Sierra Leonean crew. There were also five cadets and two wives on board. Insurance for pollution and personal liability is carried by Britannia P &amp; I, the tanker industry's mutual insurance club. The hull and machinery are insured at Lloyd's. The inquiry is bound to focus on why the ships collided when both had sophisticated radar equipment. The disaster comes nine days after the London-based International Maritime Organisation backed proposals for improving safety in response to increasing tanker accidents.</p>

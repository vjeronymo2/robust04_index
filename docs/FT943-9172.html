			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Shanks shares rise on good first quarter Shares in Shanks &amp; McEwan, the waste management company, yesterday rose 13p to 97p after a confident statement by Mr Gordon Waddell, chairman. Speaking at the annual meeting, Mr Waddell said the first quarter showed a 'satisfactory improvement' over last year. 'This reflects a strong performance in the waste services businesses, which has more than offset a disappointing quarter at Rechem,' he said. Mr Waddell said Rechem had suffered from the continuing uncertainty over the importation of waste for incineration, repeating the comment he made earlier this year that it was crucial that government statements on importation regulations be implemented.</p>

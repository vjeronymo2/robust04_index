			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Appointments: Young blood at the BBC Michael Stevenson, deputy editor of BBC Television's On The Record programme, is to become the 11th secretary of the Corporation. At the age of 31 he is believed to be the BBC's youngest secretary. Stevenson takes up his new job - which entails working closely with the BBC Governors and board of management in policy-making and implementation - on Monday in succession to John McCormick, who was recently appointed controller of BBC Scotland. Starting his BBC career in 1983 as a trainee producer in Radio Sport and Outside Broadcasts, Stevenson moved to News and Current Affairs in 1988; he was also chief assistant to the Policy and Planning Unit before moving to On The Record. A colleague says Stevenson is 'cool, with lots of political acumen and a maturity beyond his years' - attributes that have clearly attracted the attention of John Birt, the deputy director general. He hails from Staffordshire and and was educated at Doncaster Grammar School and Christ Church, Oxford.</p>

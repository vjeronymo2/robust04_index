			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Nigerian government faces stern test THE INTERIM government of Nigeria faces the first real challenge to its authority today. If a national strike called by unions and the pro-democracy movement can hold firm on the first working day after a long weekend, the economic pressures on the new government installed by the country's military will be considerable, for the main business and industrial centres, Lagos and Ibadan, will have been paralysed for nearly a week by absenteeism and strikes. The Nigeria Labour Congress called its members out on Saturday to protest against the former military government's failure to return the country to full democracy. The congress wants the interim government to honour the result of the presidential election in June, which was annulled by Gen Ibrahim Babangida, the military ruler who stepped down last Thursday. Oil workers have been on strike since Saturday, but production of crude for export was not thought to be affected. Civil service unions say they will walk out from today. Road transport is paralysed due to a chronic shortage of locally refined fuel. The introduction last week of a two-tier price system for petrol, with a new grade costing 10 times the price of the current subsidised fuel, has led to panic buying. Chief Ernest Shonekan, Nigeria's new head of government, on Sunday ordered the release of three prominent political prisoners and several journalists detained on conspiracy and sedition charges. But a military decree to ban several opposition newspapers and magazines is still in force. Mr Beko Ransome-Kuti and fellow lawyers Mr Gan Fawehinmi and Mr Femi Falana had been jailed since July 7 for organising demonstrations against the cancellation of the presidential poll results. They support the claim to the presidency of Chief Moshood Abiola, the Moslem millionaire businessman credited with having won the contest. The pro-democracy campaign is planning to hold rallies in the northern cities of Kano and Kaduna, where support for their demands has been lukewarm. See editorial comment</p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Arts: Elektra - London Promenade Concerts Big choral works have often opened the first night of the BBC Proms season, but this year the director, John Drummond, chose an opera. On Friday, we had a concert performance of Richard Strauss's Elektra, which left the stalwart BBC Singers to sit patiently for the better part of two hours before they got anything to sing. But the principals need to be leather-lunged, inexhaustible; and on that score the international cast could not be faulted. Nor, really, on anything else that mattered: any leading opera house would be proud to have such a team. If this was not the most memorable Elektra you might hear, it was impressively strong and balanced. Andrew Davis, who has become a notable exponent of Strauss's more lyrical operas, conducted the BBC Symphony. In two or three places, one missed the vicious edge that can sharpen the horrific goings-on, and though Davis built the final catastrophe effectively, the gross, hysterical exuberance of Elektra's triumph-dance was a trifle tame. On a lucky night, once the murders are accomplished the music can seem to hurl itself unstoppably forward into fatality; the Davis reading was too nicely controlled for that. More attention to the 'semi-staging' would have been wise. Nobody was credited for it in the programme, and the singers seemed to have been left to improvise it, with some odd results. When Elektra should be scrabbling in the earth for the buried axe - not easy to do on a carpeted platform] - Marilyn Zschau seized the chance, understandably, to gulp some water: our heroine seemed to be pouring herself a stiff drink before getting on with the matricide. The Aegisthus, William Cochrane, walked slowly with a cane, and was still visible on the exit stairs when he was meant to be in the throes of assassination. Cochrane was nevertheless excellently tetchy and dignified. As Clytemnestra, his partner in guilt, Eva Randova wielded pungent, edgy tone - not a contralto bellow - to make the most of the Queen's darting slyness and baleful suspicions (and supplied bloodcurdling offstage death-cries). Much to her credit, she disdained any campy grotesqueries. The first words of Willard White's bass-baritone Orestes administered one of the dramatic thrills of the evening: that doomy, implacable sound was perfect, and White sustained it up to his measured departure, murder-bent. The central sisters, Miss Zschau and as Chrysothemis Deborah Voigt, were visually ill-matched: by rights young Chrysothemis should be vapidly pretty and sweet, and Elektra a haggard, unkempt witch, where Miss Voigt showed us a handsome matron and Miss Zschau a seductive gypsy with chic ringlets and a whole repertoire of balletic gestures. Still, for a concert performance such quibbles are unimportant. More to the point, Voight's Chrysothemis was gorgeously sung - impeccably musical, subtle with details, the voice glowing confidently to the end. Until the confrontation with the Queen, I thought Miss Zschau's hard-ish timbre might be too unvaried (and her German consonants too biteless) to make a complete Elektra. With her feral vision of Orestes hunting Clytemnestra through the palace corridors, however, the portrayal took fire. The voice opened out excitingly; in all the rest of the opera, the wild veerings between joy and despair were splendid, and her dramatic pacing (except for that little drink) utterly assured.</p>

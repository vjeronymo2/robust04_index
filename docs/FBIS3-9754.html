			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 28 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic  and Slovakia have reached agreement to mutually recognize food  quality certificates under the condition that Slovakia amends  its customs law, one of the participants in today's meeting of  the Customs Union Council told CTK. He added the amendment  could have the form of a certificates clause to the Czech-Slovak  payments agreement.    Another condition is the conclusion of an inter-state  agreement dealing with cases involving certificated foodstuffs  which would not meet the prescribed quality. A commission of  experts is to be set up to make out the list of "sensitive  items" and to define conditions of their exchanges.    The above measures do not apply to re-exported goods whose  import is possible only if accompanied by certificates from the  importing country.    Measures facilitating the implementation of the agreement  are  to be worked out by May 1, the date until which Slovakia had for  the time being postponed the realization of its request for  obligatory food certification.    Slovakia started to require certificates for food imports on  February 11. One week later, on the request from Prague, it  suspended the measure temporarily. Later, the former government  of Vladimir Meciar said it would reintroduce the certificate  request as from April 1, but the new government of Jozef  Moravcik, which was appointed on March 16, postponed the measure  minimally until May 1.</p>

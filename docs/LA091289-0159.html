			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BECKER BUYS $10-MILLION LLOYDS POLICY AGAINST BEING KIDNAPED  </P> <P> West German tennis star Boris Becker has taken out a $10-million insurance  policy against being kidnaped, Lloyds of London said today.  </P> <P> A Lloyds spokesman who requested anonymity said that Becker, who Sunday added  the U.S. Open title to his Wimbledon championship, is paying $160,000 a year  for the policy, which is underwritten by Lloyds.  </P> <P> "Policies like these are common for a lot of prominent people," the Lloyds  spokesman said. "If he is not around to make his contractual agreements, a lot  of money has to be paid out by agents and others who've made arrangements."  </P> <P> Another tabloid paper, the Sun, reported that Becker regularly receives threats  in the mail.  </P> <P> Today reported that Ion Tiriac, Becker's manager, took out a $4-million policy  on Becker four years ago and that payments were $12,000 a year.  </P> <P> The paper said the worldwide attention Becker receives with victories like  Sunday's triumph over Ivan Lendl for the U.S. Open title made it necessary to  increase the kidnap coverage.  </P></p>

The scheme with a budget of 307 mio [million] German marks  (about 156 mECU) up to 1996 supports basic industrial research.    The objective of JESSI consists in creating a know-how and  research network throughout Europe, in which scientists,  producer of components and systems user work together in order  to ensure an European independent position regarding the basic  technology of microsystems. Beneficiaries are enterprises and  scientific institutions.    The notified intensity of 50 percent gross for basic  industrial research projects, 60 percent gross for this type of  research in the former GDR, 60 percent gross for SMEs [small-  and medium-size enterprises] and 65 percent gross for SMEs  conducting such research in the former GDR is in accordance with  the Community framework for state aids for R and D and previous  decisions by the Commission.    The aids for R and D given under the programme  "EUREKA-Programm JESSI" can be considered to be compatible with  the common market since they promote the execution of an  important project of common European interest. They may  therefore profit from the exemption provided for in Articles  92(3)(b) of the EC-Treaty and 61(3)(b) of the EEA-Treaty.</p>

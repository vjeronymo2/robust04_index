			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Minproc sells stake in Bakyrchik Gold Shares in Bakyrchik Gold, set up last year to exploit a gold mine in Kazakhstan, fell by 10p to 315p yesterday after it revealed that its biggest shareholder had disposed of a 19.1 per cent stake despite giving an undertaking last August that it would not sell any more shares for at least a year. The shares were placed on behalf of Minproc, the Australian group, at 300p each to raise about Pounds 9m. Minproc was the second founder-shareholder to pull out of Bakyrchik. Only five days after trading began on the London Stock Exchange, Chilewich, a New York tra- ding organisation, sold virtually all of its 25 per cent stake. Minproc also sold about 5 per cent then but also gave its undertaking to keep the rest of its shares for 12 months. There was no hint about these sales in the documents in connection with the Pounds 9m placing, at 120p a share, by Williams de Broe. Mr David Hooker, Bakyrchik's chairman, said yesterday that Minproc was in the throes of a necessary financial reconstruction and had asked Bakyrchik to be relieved from its undertaking. He said that 'while the disposal of this large stake by a founder is regrettable, as we have a financing later this year we thought it better to release Minproc from its undertaking, rather than go into that financing with a major shareholder reluctant to take up its rights'. The shares were placed without difficulty with new and existing institutional shareholders 'who have the financial resources to support future funding of the Bakyrchik mine in Kazakhstan,' he added. Mr Kevin Foo, chief executive, said the Bakyrchik joint venture was on course to pour its first gold in July and a feasibility study about a second stage, to cost some Pounds 100m, would be ready by the end of this month.</p>

The seven-party coalition  indicated that the government's budget should show concern for  the running of small and mid-sized firms and for stabilizing  employment conditions, areas particularly affected by the  nation's prolonged recession.    The coalition, which also issued a tax reform platform,  presented its view on the budget for the fiscal year starting in  April, the draft of which will be presented to the government by  the Finance Ministry on Thursday.    In line with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's emphasis on  turning government attention toward improving people's standard  of living, the platform calls for rethinking budget priorities  and reviewing the long-fixed system of public works projects.    The coalition called for measures as soon as possible, in  the  wake of December's agreement settling the Uruguay Round of world  trade talks, for reforming Japanese agriculture, including  training to keep younger generations on the farm and  revitalizing remote mountain communities.    On the international front, the coalition platform calls for  increasing the number of diplomats, improving Official  Development Assistance and actively addressing such global  issues as environmental problems and drug abuse.</p>

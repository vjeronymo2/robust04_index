			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yevgeniy Spiridonov under the heading </F> "Neighbors": "Russia To Continue the Electrification of Vietnam:  Russian and Vietnamese Heavy Industries Will Become Friends"]    [Text] The Russian Federation Committee on Machine Building  and the Vietnamese Ministry of Heavy Industry are preparing  counterproposals on cooperation between enterprises in the two  countries in the field of machinery and equipment manufacture,  an agreement regarding which will be signed on 6 June 1994  (during a visit to Moscow by Vietnamese prime minister Vo Van  Kiet). An ADS correspondent learned this from Anatoliy Ogurtsov,  chairman of the Russian Committee on Machine Building, who  visited Hanoi as part of a government delegation headed by  vice-premier Yuriy Yarov. Between 12 April and 15 April the  delegation held talks within the framework of the  intergovernmental Russian-Vietnamese commission on economic,  trade-related and scientific-technical cooperation.    During a meeting with Tran Lum, Vietnam's minister of heavy  industries, said Anatoliy Ogurtsov, the Vietnamese expressed  their intention to renew the partnership between machine  builders in the two countries, particularly with regard to the  manufacture of electric machines with a capacity of 10-50  kilowatts and 5,000 kilowatts for the micro-hydroelectric power  plants and small hydroelectric plants that Vietnam is preparing  to build in inaccessible areas in the northern part of the  country. Since it was with assistance from the former USSR that  Vietnam built virtually all its large-scale energy facilities,  including seven units of the Hoa Binh Hydroelectric Power  Station, with a capacity of 1.92 gigawatts, according to Mr.  Ogurtsov it is like God himself is telling Russian machine  builders to continue their partnership with their Vietnamese  colleagues in the field of electrification. Particularly since  the Central Boiler and Turbine Institute Scientific Production  Association, the Leningrad Metals Plant Joint-Stock Company and  the Syzran Turbine Plant are already manufacturing a series of  small-scale hydroelectric units developed by them, units that  are already operating successfully in the republics of the  Northern Caucasus, Tajikistan and Kirghizia.    Vietnamese machine builders have also indicated an interest  in the joint manufacture of certain types of metalworking  machinery with computer numerical control, as well as assembly  of the Vladimir Tractor Plant's DT-50 and DT-52 wheeled  tractors, the Volgograd Tractor Plant's DT-75 caterpillar tread  tractors and KamAZ vehicles at plants in Vietnam. Also announced  was a shipment of sheet metal-bending presses manufactured by  Tyazhpressmash Joint-Stock Company (Ryazan) and the Kolomna  Heavy Machine Tool Plant Production Association. According to  Mr. Ogurtsov, all these proposals by Vietnam are presently under  consideration, and by the time of the May arrival in Moscow of  Vietnam's minister of heavy industries Tran Lum the forms of  cooperation between machine building enterprises in the two  countries will have been worked out, as well as schedules and  prices for shipments in both directions.</p>

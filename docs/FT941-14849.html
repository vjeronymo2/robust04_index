			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / International Capital Markets: Malta free port operator seeks to raise Dollars 250m Malta Freeport Corporation (MFC) is to raise up to Dollars 250m in international capital markets to finance the development of a new container terminal. The financing will be guaranteed by the Republic of Malta. The government and MFC hope to get the debt rated by Moody's and Standard and Poor's, the US credit rating agencies. A Maltese issuer has never before sought a rating outside Malta. MFC has engaged Bankers Trust to arrange the financing. It hopes to conclude the deal before the end of June. The new terminal will handle 500,000 containers. This will double the overall capacity of the free port zone, situated on the island's south coast. The terminal shipped 288,000 containers in 1993 and predicts a further rise to 400,000 this year.</p>

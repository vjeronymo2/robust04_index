			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Song Ui-tal: "Russia's Ultramodern Brains Are </F> Coming in Flocks"]    [Excerpts] The Hanbit Apartments are at a 10-minute-drive  from the Taedok Research Complex in Yusong District, Taejon  city. About 20 blue-eyed members of the "Russian team" join in  this apartment complex' soccer team practice at 0530 every  morning. The "Russian team" is merely a pet name given by the  residents of this apartment complex, not a real soccer team  representing Russia. They are high- level Russian technological  brains who have been invited to and are working at the Samsung  Space Aeronautical Research Institute. [passage omitted]    After an hour of exercise, they come to the office each  morning on a 45-seat bus provided by the institute. They are  researchers from the SDC [expansion unknown], a company  specializing in engine design located in Moscow, Russia.    The SDC is a private company formed in 1989 by former  researchers of "Soyuz," Russia's state-run engine designing  bureau, with a total of 1,500 employees. A total of 28 came to  ROK, including seven doctorate-degree holders. Most of them are  from the Moscow (?Mollini) University, which is called "Russia's  MIT," and from the Moscow Aviation College. They came to this  research complex last June under a one-year contract, and live  in apartments ranging from 30-pyong [one pyong is equivalent to  3.954 square yards] to 45- pyong in size, provided by Samsung.  They participate in debates with researchers from Samsung and in  joint research projects, and sometimes offer advice.    Their specialized fields are mainly design and manufacturing  of industrial gas turbine engines, as well as technological  support for production. Samsung Aviation Company has intensively  researched this field for several years, according to its  long-term development plan. This being the case, the 28 Russians  are providing technical training to the Samsung side in a  person-to-person basis under a tight schedule in their three  respective specialized fields-- combustion, turbine, and  compression. Kim Chae-chol (47), director of the company and  head of a research and development team, said: The United States  and Japan, which have ultramodern technology in these fields,  have built thick barriers to protect their technology. Under  this situation, cooperation from Russia's technological camp,  which competes with the United States for the summit position of  the world, is of great help to us. In the event that we obtain a  broad range of technology, ranging from basic technology to  high-level applied technology, including aircraft engine, the  ROK will be able to enter into the rank of 10-top aviation  industry states before long.    According to the materials of the Ministry of Science and  Technology, since scientific and technological exchanges began  on a full scale between the two nations in December 1990 when  the ROK- Russia agreement on science and technology was  concluded, the number of Russian scientists and technicians, who  came to the ROK and stayed for over a month, was 95 in 1992 and  116 in 1993. This number is expected to reach 150 this year,  thus showing nearly a 25 percent increase each year. [passage  omitted]    The areas in which Russian scientists have remarkably  advanced are ultramodern technology fields including space  aeronautics, new materials, machinery, semiconductor, and  chemistry, where the domestic technological foundation is  relatively weak.    Government-supported research institutes, including the  Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Atomic Energy  Research Institute, Energy Research Institute, Machinery  Research Institute, and Standardization Research Institute;  civilian enterprises that are in true need of basic and  ultramodern science and technology; and even universities,  competitively employ Russian scientists and technicians. Thus,  they are accelerating the development of new technology. In  particular, practical joint research results have appeared in  succession in certain research project domains. Such results are  being accepted as a "green light" for strengthening the nation's  competitive power in industrial fields. [passage omitted]    In 1992, the ROK and Russia, for the first time, jointly  applied for patents for automobile oil filters; carbon pellicle  coating equipment, and natural gas engines. This is regarded as  an example of the achievements attained with the support of  Russian scientists.    Civilian business firms are inviting Russian scientists more  actively than government-supported research organizations, thus  attracting the people's attention. This trend is being led by  large business groups such as Samsung, Daewoo, and Lucky-Gold  Star. Samsung was the first business group to employ Russian  scientists under long-term contracts. In April 1992, Samsung  employed Mr. (Georgiy Park), a Moscow University doctorate  degree graduate with a major in semiconductors, under a one-year  contract basis. He has been in charge of the joint research  development of optical electronics at the Samsung General  Research Institute in Kihung, Kyonggi Province. He is known to  be a third-generation Korean in Russia. He worked as senior  researcher at the (Ioepe) Research Institute and (Polius)  Research Institute, renowned as authoritative research  institutes in Russia.    In addition, the Samsung General Chemical Company invited  four technicians from the (Kalkin) Research Institute, which is  reputed for its development of new ultramodern materials of  synthetic chemistry, to work in its chemical research institute  at the Taedok Research Complex, starting in November 1993.  [passage omitted]    What interests the people is that the Russian technical  teams' activities have even extended to the domestic "beer war."  On 20 May, the Chillo Group's "Kas Beer" challenged "Hite Beer"  and "OB-Ice Beer." [passage omitted]    The Russian scientists actively responded to the request for  participation in long- and short-term joint projects by major  universities including the Seoul University, Inha University,  Catholic University, Kyongbuk University, Kyonghui University,  and Hongik University, and the number of Russian scientists  participating in domestic projects ranges from 20 to 50 each  year. The Russian scientists' advance to the ROK has been  prompted by the increasing demand for them by our domestic  business groups. A ROK business firm can acquire high-level  technology, which cannot be obtained from any other advanced  country, by paying a low salary of between $1,000 and $2,000 a  month. This being the case, the increase in demand is quite  natural. On the other hand, the Russian scientists are paid  three times more in the ROK than in their home country.    However, relevant officials from business circles point out  that since the treaty for the prevention of double taxation  between the ROK and Russia and other CIS countries has not been  concluded, Russian scientists are subject to pay over 20 percent  higher tax- rate. As a result, instances in which Russian  scientists have refused our side's employment proposals are  increasing. Besides, precise materials concerning the background  of Russian research institutes and scientists are not available  at home, thus causing difficulties in choosing Russian  scientists.    Yi Chin-kyu, secretary at the technical cooperation section  in the Ministry of Science and Technology, pointed out that  "Russia has recently emerged rapidly as a source for our nation  to import ultramodern technology, pushing aside the United  States, Japan, and the European Union. With a view to  invigorating the exchange of scientists between the ROK and  Russia, the government will abolish various restrictions,  including the ratification of the treaty for prevention of  double taxation and the simplification of the visa issuance  procedure, and will work out plans for the active inducement of  Russian scientists."</p>

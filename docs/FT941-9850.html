			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / MGN pension case dropped Capel-Cure Myers, the securities house, has dropped its Pounds 6m legal action against Credit Suisse arising from CCM's litigation with the Mirror Group Newspapers pension scheme trustees over the Maxwell affair. Capel-Cure Myers, one of the fund managers which acted for the MGN pension scheme, had begun proceedings against Credit Suisse for alleged breach of trust over the handling of assets it had passed to the bank. The decision to settle is a direct consequence of last month's out-of-court settlement of the main litigation when Capel-Cure Myers, Invesco Asset Management and Lehman Brothers agreed to pay a total of Pounds 32m to the pension fund trustees. Of this, Capel-Cure Myers paid Pounds 6m, Lehmans Pounds 15m and Invesco Pounds 11m. Under the terms of yesterday's settlement, Credit Suisse has continued not to admit any liability. However, both sides have agreed to fund their own legal costs. A joint statement from Capel-Cure Myers and Credit Suisse said: 'Participation in the settlement is a commercial judgment by both parties who believe this course of action to be in the best interests of their respective businesses.' Preliminary High Court hearings had begun earlier this week but were adjourned whilst the out-of-court talks that led to the settlement were held.</p>

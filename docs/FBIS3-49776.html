Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski said that the  Polish Government must still approve the partnership, but ruled  out the possibility that the government would reject the  project. He said that the government had already charged the  premier with supporting the project and expressing Poland's  willingness to participate in it.    The Partnership for Peace will not remove a dangerous  political vacuum, but has enough provisions to prevent one from  appearing, Olechowski said. Poland is not striving for  admission into NATO out of fear for its own security, but rather  because the membership of Central and Eastern European countries  in European structures should be a guarantee that this part of  Europe does not become a "gray zone."    Olechowski said that joint exercises between Polish and NATO  military units could be held this year. He did not rule out the  possibility that other partners would also participate in the  exercises, but added that it is important to consider the  political consequences of such activities in advance.    Polish Premier Waldemar Pawlak said at the press conference  that the continued existence of the Visegrad Group would not be  decided on through top-level political talks but through  concrete cooperation. Poland is interested in developing its  infrastructure and communications, he said, citing the planned  construction of a highway south from Gdansk, which he said would  be important not only for Poland but for the other Visegrad  countries as well. Poland would also welcome the opening of  American and Western European markets to Central European,  particularly Polish, goods, he said.</p>

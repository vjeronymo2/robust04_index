			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Kaifu is elected to head new alliance Mr Toshiki Kaifu, a former Japanese prime minister, yesterday staged a political comeback when the country's new opposition alliance elected him as its first leader. Mr Kaifu, only seven months ago a member of the Liberal Democratic party, now leads the New Frontier party (NFP), the main political threat to his former colleagues. It is the result of a merger of nine opposition groups, to be formally launched tomorrow, dedicated to making Japanese politics more responsive to the aspirations of the electorate than to the will of party factions. The NFP's birth comes two weeks before the introduction of the new political and electoral system, pioneered by Mr Kaifu, which provided the impulse for its formation. He won 131 of the votes cast by the NFP's 214 upper and lower house members of parliament, easily beating his main rival, Mr Tsutomu Hata, prime minister of the last government, who attracted 52 votes. Mr Ichiro Ozawa, Japan's most powerful behind-the-scenes political strategist, who engineered the NFP merger, was elected unopposed as secretary general. Yesterday's vote reunites the pair who brought the LDP a general election victory in 1990, when Mr Kaifu was LDP prime minister and Mr Ozawa his secretary general. This brings some stability to formerly shaky opposition politics, though the new party is marred by rivalries at the top. It also gives Mr Kaifu, 64, some compensation for his failed attempt for power on leaving his old party last June in protest at the LDP's decision to back Mr Tomiichi Murayama, head of the Social Democrat party, to succeed Mr Hata as prime minister. Mr Kaifu stood against Mr Murayama and lost by a wide margin. Mr Kaifu's first job will be to resolve discord between his most important supporters, exposed by the election battle. Relations have cooled between Mr Ozawa and Mr Hata, formerly close political partners who brought down the LDP after 38 years in power by leading a defection to form an opposition group early last year. Despite the problems at the top, the pressure on party members to stay united is strong. The NFP has 187 seats in the lower house, well short of the ruling coalition's 293. It can increase this only by wooing defectors and by staying united in the general election, which some senior LDP officials favour holding early next year. New funding rules favour large parties.</p>

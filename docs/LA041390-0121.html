			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LUMBER GROUP: JAPANESE ARE 'STONEWALLING';  </P> <P> TRADE: AN AMERICAN INDUSTRY GROUP SAYS THERE'S NO REAL PROGRESS IN TALKS AIMED  AT AVERTING U.S. SANCTIONS FOR ALLEGED UNFAIR PRACTICES.  </P> <P> The president of the National Forest Products Assn., a U.S. trade group, has  accused Japan of "stonewalling" in negotiations aimed at averting U.S.  retaliation against Japan for allegedly unfair trade practices involving forest  products.  </P> <P> "Real progress in these negotiations could increase American sales to Japan by  $2 billion a year," Barry M. Cullen said at a news conference here Wednesday.  "We are not even close to that right now in these negotiations."  </P> <P> He said last year's sales to the Japanese, mostly logs, amounted to $2.8  billion.  </P> <P> The forestry talks opened on the heels of the settlement of disputes over  supercomputers and satellites, and U.S. officials had hoped that they would  wipe the slate clean, at least for the moment, of unfair trade complaints  involving threats of retaliation against Japan.  </P> <P> But a U.S. government negotiator, who asked not to be identified by name, said  it is "very, very unlikely" that negotiators will reach agreement in the  present round of talks on forest products.  </P> <P> "There has been no movement toward what we want," the negotiator said.  </P> <P> If no agreement is reached by June 16, President Bush is empowered to impose  retaliatory sanctions against Japan. The current round of talks is expected to  continue today for a fifth day of talks that originally were scheduled to end  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Cullen said U.S. forestry products firms are seeking "progress from the  standpoint of an entire package" that deals with "tariffs, building codes,  product standards, certification and classification procedures, subsidies and  other structural issues such as housing and land-use policies."  </P> <P> He said "to date, all of the discussion has focused on building codes and  product standards, and that discussion has been very, very disappointing to us.  We want to see substantial progress, (not) stonewalling."  </P> <P> Cullen and other representatives of the U.S. forest products industry dismissed  as out of date Japanese fears that construction of three- and four-story wooden  buildings, including apartment houses, could put people in danger from fires  and earthquakes.  </P> <P> Japan, which limits the height of wooden buildings to two stories, has offered  to permit construction of three-story buildings in resort areas and uncrowded  sections of small towns but not in urban areas, where demand for lumber would  be the greatest.  </P> <P> Ronald R. Walker, another official of the National Forest Products Assn., said  Japanese negotiators had argued against accepting American building standards  by saying that Japanese earthquakes are unique because of their severity.  </P> <P> "Yet the strongest earthquakes that have occurred to date have been in other  countries," Walker said.  </P></p>

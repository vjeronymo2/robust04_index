			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> OUSTED LEADER ZHAO MAY BE TRIED, CHINESE SUGGEST  </P> <P> China today refused to rule out a trial and further punishment for Zhao Ziyang,  who was ousted as Communist Party chief for opposing the military crackdown  that crushed pro-democracy demonstrators.  </P> <P> "His problem is still being investigated," government spokesman Yuan Mu said at  the first news conference by a high-ranking official since troops on June 3-4  marched on Tian An Men Square and attacked unarmed demonstrators.  </P> <P> When the party Central Committee ousted him as secretary general on June 24, it  accused Zhao of supporting the protesters and splitting the party, and said his  case would be dealt with internally. Since then, however, official criticism  has escalated, fueling speculation Zhao may stand trial.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Collaboration Alleged  </P> <P> One major government report last week accused Zhao's aides of collaborating  with protest leaders accused of trying to overthrow the government. It stopped  short of also accusing Zhao of plotting a coup.  </P> <P> Yuan stressed that the party charges and decision to treat Zhao's case as an  internal disciplinary matter are not final.  </P> <P> "How the problem will finally be dealt with will be decided according to the  findings of the investigation," he told more than 100 Chinese and foreign  reporters.  </P> <P> Also today, authorities deported two reporters -- one American and one  Taiwanese -- and gave a second Taiwanese reporter 48 hours to leave. All are  accused of violating martial law bans on reporting activity. They bring to nine  the number of reporters ordered to leave China since June 4.  </P> <P> The deported American is Mark Hopkins, a reporter for the U.S. government-run  Voice of America.  </P></p>

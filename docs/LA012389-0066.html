			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> IT'S ALMOST GAME OF LOST OPPORTUNITY FOR 49ERS  </P> <P> San Francisco's greatest Super Bowl triumph nearly disintegrated in a flurry of  mistakes and missed opportunities.  </P> <P> The heroics of Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, John Taylor and the combined efforts of  the defense produced a come-from-behind, 20-16 victory over the Cincinnati  Bengals Sunday and saved such players as Roger Craig, Randy Cross and Taylor  from spending a long off-season pondering their errors.  </P> <P> Thanks to the 49ers' fourth game-winning rally in the fourth quarter this  season, San Francisco will likely be called the team of the 1980's.  </P> <P> "It's got to be one of our best wins ever," said Montana, who completed 23 of  36 passes for 357 yards. "To be down by a field goal and come back and win it  like we did . . . it's got to rank up there, believe me."  </P> <P> Montana's 10-yard touchdown pass into the outstretched arms of Taylor in the  end zone with 34 seconds remaining brought back memories of what had been known  as "The Catch" but which might now be renamed "The Other Catch." The Catch was  made by Dwight Clark, who leaped in the end zone to grab a high Montana pass to  beat Dallas in the NFC championship game 7 years ago.  </P> <P> Montana said he would have a difficult time choosing between the two.  </P> <P> "We were in a tough position, but we never gave up," Montana said of the  92-yard drive at game's end. "We had a lot of time on the clock. We felt we  could move the ball in that situation. We had to be confident because we had  done it in the past."  </P> <P> Craig, who wasn't on the 49ers' team that beat Cincinnati, 26-21, in the 1982  Super Bowl, scored a touchdown in San Francisco's victory over Miami in the  1985 game. On Sunday, Craig ran for 74 yards and made critical receptions of 13  and 8 yards during the final drive.  </P> <P> "That was the greatest drive in the history of the Super Bowl," Craig said.  "It's got to be."  </P> <P> In the second quarter, Craig had fumbled, the 49ers' only turnover of the game,  to kill a drive into Cincinnati territory.  </P> <P> "I had to make up for that fumble," Craig said. "Right before that, the other  players were telling me to keep two hands on the ball, but I didn't."  </P> <P> Craig said the 49ers' experience in championship situations made the difference  down the stretch.  </P> <P> "We kept talking to ourselves throughout the game and saying not to get down on  ourselves," he said. "And Joe Montana and Randy Cross kept providing leadership  in the huddle."  </P></p>

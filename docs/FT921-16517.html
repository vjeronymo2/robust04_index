			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Kenya defector to launch second opposition party MR MWAI KIBAKI, one of Kenya's most prominent politicians, who resigned last week from the cabinet, yesterday branded President Daniel arap Moi a dictator and said he would formally launch a second new opposition party next week. The Democratic Party joins the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD) in a prospective challenge to the ruling Kenya African National Union (Kanu) at forthcoming multi-party general elections. It was unclear yesterday how many of the recent defectors from Mr Moi's government would join the Democratic Party, but it is increasingly apparent that the formation of a new party has dealt a severe blow to Mr Moi and has hastened the fragmentation of Kanu. Together, both parties will raise a formidable challenge to Mr Moi in the election this year, particularly in the critical Central Province, the homeland of the large and wealthy Kikuyu tribe. The resignation from the government of five Kikuyu politicians in the past week has demonstrated what little support Kanu has in Central Province, which contains about a quarter of Kenya's population. Questions remain about the credibility of many of the defectors who served for years under President Moi without having raised their voices in support of allegations of corruption, ballot-rigging and authoritarianism which have tarnished the Kanu government. However, the momentum appears to favour the opposition. Kanu, for the moment, seems incapable of the overhaul and cleansing needed if it is to face a critical electorate. Concerns about political stability are also being raised, given the continuing inability of the government to quell bitter tribal clashes over land in the Trans Nzoia district of western Kenya.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by al-Sa'id al-Shatti from Damietta] </F>   [Text] Security Department interrogations of the members of  the terrorist organization led by Dr. 'Ali Hasan al-Day,  ophthalmologist and chairman of the Damietta City Council, have  revealed the existence of similar groups in many other  governorates. These groups rely principally on the members of  local councils affiliated with the Socialist Labor Party [SLP].  Some of the suspects have confessed, implicating their  colleagues in other governorates.    The security departments will soon announce that they have  uncovered new terrorist organizations in several governorates.    Dr. 'Ali al-Day said that as chairman of the City Council,  he  approved a Ramadan soccer tournament in the Ra's al-Barr sea  resort at the request of Mustafa Subayhah, chairman of the City  Council's Youth and Sports Committee. He denied that the team  members were trained in karate or kung fu.    Investigations have shown that the chairman of the City  Council, assisted by several SLP members, exploited the council  and his own position to implement suspect plans and disseminate  ideas calling for the regime's overthrow.    The suspects are: Dr. 'Ali Hasan al-Day, ophthalmologist and  chairman of the City Council; Ashraf Zakariya 'Ubayd, deputy  City Council chairman and decorator; Muhammad Muhammad al-Jundi,  furniture dealer; Hasan al-Sayyid al-Mursi, optician;  'Abd-al-Hadi al-Nahhas, freelance accountant; Hamdi 'Isa,  agronomist; Husayn Husayn 'Ukashah, freelance accountant;  al-Sa'id Muhammad Musa, decorator; Ahmad Gharib Abu-Diyal,  vocational school student; Karim 'Abduh Shamsu, furniture maker;  Jamal 'Abduh Shamsu, furniture maker; 'Adduh 'Ali Abu-Mahdi,  carpenter; decorators Khamis Ibrahim and Muhammad Ibrahim; and  furniture makers Ashraf Muhammad Basha, 'Abduh Abu-al-'Aynayn,  and Mahmud al-Bih.    Mustafa al-Badawayhi, director of Damietta's Prosecution  Office, remanded them for 15 days for interrogation on a charge  of establishing an organization seeking to overthrow the  government.    He also instructed that Damietta Public Attorney Counselor  Ahmad al-'Izabi to supervise the arrest of the following eight  suspects: Mustafa Subayhah, City Council member; Wa'il  Subayhah, secondary school student; Salamah al-'Iraqi; City  Council member and furniture dealer; Salamah al-Bahawan,  agronomist and City Council member; Muhammad Isma'il al-Rawdi,  employee; Mahmud al-Sha'rawi, furniture maker; Ibrahim Durrah,  decorator; and Ahmad Jaddu, decorator.</p>

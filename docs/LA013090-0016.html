			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: LA JOLLA  </P> <P> One man died after falling from a cliff about 200 yards north of Scripps Pier,  and a woman was in serious condition Monday after falling partway down while  trying to reach him, police said.  </P> <P> Marisa-Ann Ortiz, 21, and Jeffrey Alan Sardina, 22, had spent Sunday evening on  the UC San Diego campus with a friend, Scott Douglas Simon, and the three ended  up at the cliffs about 12:30 a.m., campus police said.  </P> <P> Simon told campus police that, about 2:30 a.m., he tired and went to the car to  sleep. He woke up about 4 a.m., just as Ortiz approached and said she could not  find Sardina.  </P> <P> Simon and Ortiz searched the cliff for about 20 minutes, then returned to the  car. About 6 a.m., they searched the area again and spotted Sardina's body  about 7 a.m.  </P> <P> Simon left to call the campus police, leaving Ortiz behind.  </P> <P> When rescue workers arrived about 8:15 a.m., they saw Sardina's body, and Ortiz  was found about 25 feet from the bottom of the 175-foot cliff.  </P> <P> Capt. Allan Macdonald of the San Diego Fire Department said firefighters  rappelled the cliff to reach the woman.  </P> <P> Ortiz was taken by helicopter to Scripps Memorial Hospital, La Jolla. She was  in the surgical intensive-care unit with a broken pelvis, internal injuries and  cuts, a hospital spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> George Dickason, county deputy coroner, said Sardina lived at 3048 Renault St.,  San Diego. An autopsy is pending. YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ  </P></p>

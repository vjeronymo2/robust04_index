Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk issued a decree late on  Tuesday [15 March] to ban the Crimean poll because of its being  out of line with the Ukrainian Constitution and laws.    The Crimean referendum ordered by Meshkov is designed to  elicit an answer to two questions. One is on relations between  Simferopol and Kiev and the other on dual citizenship.    Meshkov said that such questions "are to be decided locally  and not by Kiev" warning against attempts to try to deprive the  public of its right to freedom of expression.    He said that an administrative ban was an on-off affair  because the referendum issue might resurface within a week or a  month again.    "There is a body of opinion which Kiev may find more useful  to know of than Simferopol", Meshkov said adding that he saw no  reason for further discussion on that score.</p>

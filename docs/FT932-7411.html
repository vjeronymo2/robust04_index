			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Arts: Heart of the Church of England - Architecture There are not many architects who have written the biography of one of their clients. Sir Herbert Baker (1862-1946) is the exception with his book Cecil Rhodes by his architect, published in 1934. The meeting between Baker and Rhodes in South Africa in the 1890s was crucial for both of them. Rhodes saw in the English architect the man to create his dream of an Imperial culture and architecture in southern Africa. It was through Rhodes that Baker acquired his knowledge of ancient classical architecture, since Rhodes sent Baker off on a tour in 1899 to look at Rome, Paestum, Agrigentum, Thebes and Athens as well as ancient Egypt. The story of this shared vision of the role of architecture by both architect and patron is a revealing and fascinating one. Rhodes' vision extended beyond architecture and politics to the permanent encouragement of learning through the Rhodes Scholarships at Oxford. It was appropriate that Rhodes House in Oxford, where his scholars live, should have been designed by Baker in 1929 in an unusual blend of classical and Cotswold styles. These thoughts about Herbert Baker and that curious world of 'Scouting for Boys' Imperialism that he shared with Rhodes, have been prompted by a recent visit to one of Sir Herbert Baker's masterpieces in London: Church House, Westminster, which was completed in 1940, and has recently been completely refurbished. The Church of England does not have a Vatican; if it did it would be a combination of the offices of the Church Commissioners, Church House, Westminster Abbey and Lambeth Palace. In fact Church House has become increasingly important in the life of the Church of England as it is now the permanent home of the General Synod and its Boards and Councils. As the Church of England seems now to define theology by the strange and unreliable processes of human democracy, this home of the Church's Parliament has acquired extraordinary significance. In 1988 a decision was made to sell off Church House in much the same way as the Church has sold so much of its property. But this decision was determinedly challenged by the remarkable Mr Roy Lyon, a member of the Synod from Liverpool. He sensed the disastrous consequences of such a pointless move and fought like a tiger to persuade the authorities to change their minds. It was like David and Goliath - a victory for reason against bureaucracy and the property market. Sir Herbert Baker was a contemporary and sometime collaborator (in New Delhi) of Sir Edwin Lutyens. The two men were to fall out in Delhi - perhaps friendly co-operation on that scale was doomed. Both men produced a vast number of important buildings in Britain and the Empire. Both men were building at a time when craftmanship was still at a high level. Both men, in different ways, wanted to reinterpret architectural traditions for the Imperial age. Baker believed in associational architecture; Lutyens believed in the pure aesthetics of architecture. Lutyens was the better architect. This is not to say that Baker was a bad architect. If as thorough a reappraisal of his work was to be carried out as has been started by historians looking at Lutyens' achievements, then Baker's achievements might also shine. Church House is a very characteristic Baker building. He took the commission very seriously and wrote, with no modesty at all, 'I was very happy at having this opportunity in perhaps my last great work of expressing in the fabric of the building some little of the story and the ideals, as I conceived them, of the Church of England.' Baker's expression of ideals largely takes the form of heraldry, symbolism, inscriptions and an enthusiasm for Rupert Brooke. He collaborated with the sculptor Charles Wheeler and the artist Thomas Monnington to embellish his building. Like so much of Baker's work - South Africa House in Trafalgar Square, India House in the Aldwych and the Bank of England - the symbolism is only skin deep. Handsome though the circular assembly hall is in Church House, it is not a great piece of architecture. What is memorable is the great golden inscription taken from the old Church Service Book: 'Holy is the true light and passing wonderful, lending radiance to them that endured in the heat of the conflict; from Christ they inherit a home of unfading splendour, wherein they rejoice with gladness evermore.' Baker saw this beauty as taking the form of what he called in his memoirs, 'a galaxy of heraldry and symbols representing the different centres of the Empire'. Somewhere at the centre of this galaxy was the Church of England. The chapel is the most successful part of Church House, with its stalls for all the bishops and an altar which is a slab of black marble carried on the shoulders of eight winged angels. As at the chapel for Haileybury School and the sanctuary at Pretoria Cathedral, Baker has designed here a curved apse with a sense of spaciousness and dignity. I greatly enjoyed seeing the interiors of Church House because - although they can all now be hired for conferences and functions, and they have been well modernised and refurbished - they are not easily visible. What interested me most of all was the strange period atmosphere created by Baker for the peculiar world of official Anglicanism and English Imperialism. God and the royal family are intermingled in an English dream world of order and history. Church House is reticent behind its flint facade on Dean's Yard but within its heart are passions that are only hinted at in the architecture and sculpture. Sacrifice and service and the safety of democratic religion are all here in a building that conceals a potent message beneath its comfortable surfaces.</p>

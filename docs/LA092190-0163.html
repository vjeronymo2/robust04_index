			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FALL BRINGS A DIVERSITY OF ARTS: IT'S LIVE, IT'S NEW, IT'S LOCAL;  </P> <P> ART: AREA GALLERIES PLAN A VARIETY OF THEMED GROUP EXHIBITIONS AND SOLO SHOWS  AND TRY TO OVERCOME WESTSIDE COMPETITION.  </P> <P> If art activity in the San Fernando Valley hasn't exactly kept pace with the  continuing Westside explosion, local galleries at least have maintained a  steady presence with widespread exhibitions displaying a diversity of interests  and medias. And this fall is no different with a collection of themed group art  exhibitions and solo shows in area galleries.  </P> <P> But spreading fine art through the Valley has remained a struggle in several  ways, with gallery closings outpacing openings even on busy Ventura Boulevard.  </P> <P> "When I first started talking about operating a gallery in the Valley, a lot of  people said it was a cultural wasteland," said Scott Canty, art curator for the  municipal satellite galleries, which includes the Artspace Gallery in Woodland  Hills. "And I told them to picture me as water to the wasteland, so that the  culture can grow. But I'm finding that it takes more than two years. It takes a  longer time to develop a relationship with the arts.  </P> <P> "I think it's a prejudice," Canty added. "Santa Monica and the West L.A. area  is a very enriched area with a lot of people in higher-income brackets. If I  was a gallery, why should I open up a gallery in Encino or Woodland Hills, when  there is already a base in the Westside?"  </P> <P> Nonetheless, the Artspace continues with its 2-year-old tradition of presenting  emerging artists with "Elements." The show, which opened last week, includes  work by Los Angeles-area painters Marilyn Duzy, Pamela Holmes and Jean Togood,  colored pencil drawings by Dara Mark, photographic works by Sant Subagh K.  Khalsa and rock and wood sculpture by Karlin Wong.  </P> <P> All the works in the show incorporate images of nature. Duzy's large canvases  depict nature's scope and power with raging fires, a storm-swept ocean and  grain-covered fields, while Khalsa's photographic works offer desolate areas  invaded by technology.  </P> <P> "It's nice to be in a show where the work really isn't competing on any sort of  philosophical basis," said Mark, whose own drawings of California's subtle  seasonal changes were made over the course of a year by returning to the same  outdoor vantage point. "It feels that everybody is in agreement that it's  important to look at the environment, to relate to it."  </P> <P> After "Elements" closes Oct. 6, Artspace will present a group exhibit of  spiritual work called "Of the Spirit," from Oct. 22 to Dec. 1. Described by  Canty as "art that transcends into the realm of angels and truth," the  exhibition will include painters Dan Callis and Michael Schrauzer, sculptor  Roger Feldman and muralist Kent Twitchell.  </P> <P> Artspace is located at 21800 Oxnard St., in Woodland Hills. It is open noon to  5 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays. For more information, call (818) 716-2786.  </P> <P> Diverse perspectives on photographic portraiture are presented in "The Real and  Unreal" at Burbank's Photo Art Gallery through Oct. 31. The exhibition,  spotlighting the work of artists Ken Miller, Gordon Mark and the solo-named A.  Frasheski and Jeff, offer wildly divergent directions of photography.  </P> <P> "When I was curating, I was looking at the literalist and expressionist in  portraiture," said gallery director Eileen Webb. "Some of it is very abstract."  </P> <P> She compared the work of Miller, and its stark documentation of the  deterioration of San Francisco's underclass, with the photographs of Diane  Arbus. By contrast, Jeff, whose work is displayed at the New York Museum of  Modern Art, is often clouded under layers of hand-coloring.  </P> <P> "It's almost difficult to recognize its original photographic content," she  said. "There are little elements that come through. But it is so vigorously  colored that there is a tension between the two."  </P> <P> The Photo Art Gallery, located at 150 S. San Fernando Road, is open 9 a.m. to  5:30 p.m. Mondays, 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays, 10  a.m. to 7 p.m. Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturdays, and 2 p.m. to 6 p.m.  Sundays. For additional information, call (818) 846-0673.  </P> <P> Another themed exhibit is on view through Nov. 18 at the Finegood Art Gallery,  at the Bernard Milken Jewish Community campus in West Hills. Titled  "Spirituality: Visions + Viewpoints," the collection of paintings interpret  spirituality in connection with the current Jewish holidays of Rosh Hashana and  Yom Kippur.  </P> <P> The final collection of paintings by Yona Brand, Rachelle Mark and Adrianne  Prober were chosen along the same standards as other, non-religious exhibitions  at the gallery, said Marlene Streit, co-chairwoman of the event, and who is  also guiding a group show of 25, mostly local artists, at the Toluca Lake  gallery.  </P> <P> "The intent was to bring out this time of spirituality, reflection and  meditation. Each of the artists has their own vision of what spirituality is,"  she said.  </P> <P> The Finegood Art Gallery, located at the Bernard Milken Jewish Community  Campus, 22622 Vanowen St., is open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays,  1 to 5 p.m. Sundays. For more information, call (818) 716-1100.  </P> <P> At the Installations One Gallery in Encino, a 10-year retrospective of original  works by Los Angeles Times editorial illustrator Richard Milholland will be the  subject of his first local solo exhibition since 1983.  </P> <P> "The art world considers this simply illustration," said Steven Lee Stinnett,  the show's director-curator. "But they are really reacting to the idea. They  haven't seen the work."  </P> <P> Stinnett said that out of a collection of 300 illustrations, he expected to be  showing at least 60 on the gallery's walls until the show's conclusion Oct. 13.  </P> <P> The work is a lyrical, sometimes blunt collection of images of faces and hands,  critical portraits of such world figures as Idi Amin, that Stinnett compared to  the work of the noted Belgian surrealist Rene Magritte.  </P> <P> "He has always had a sort of surrealistic bent to his work. It's an unusual  blend of traditional rendering and surrealism. The work tends to be a little on  the dark side."  </P> <P> "The Color and Pattern Show," a group exhibition of abstract art by 12 local  painters, follows the Milholland show at the gallery Oct. 18, continuing  through Nov. 10. Gallery hours at the Installations One Gallery, located at  15821 Ventura Blvd., in the Encino Terrace Center, are currently 10 a.m. to 8  p.m. Tuesday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturdays. For more information,  call (818) 789-9706.  </P> <P> Further east along the boulevard, the Tower Gallery will spotlight artist  Samantha October, who specializes in idealized oil portraits of pop music  figures. For a few days beginning Oct. 25, the mixture of 25 black and white  and colorful images will replace the variety of limited-edition prints that  hang above sculptures in the gallery's front space.  </P> <P> While the Sherman Oaks gallery devotes most of its space to prints by such  nationally distributed artists as Erte and Michael Parkes, Tower has often  presented work with a pop music slant. Graphic prints and paintings by crooner  Tony Bennett and rockers John Lennon and Rolling Stones guitarist Ron Wood have  been the subject of earlier events at the gallery, which is an offshoot of the  large Tower Records chain.  </P> <P> "It's a type of link to people's earlier years, when they were young adults,"  said gallery director Barry Smith. "Now these individuals are 30, 35 or 40  years old, and professionals. And this is something they can identify with."  </P> <P> On Nov. 15, the Tower Gallery will host a reception and book signing for  veteran animator Chuck Jones, while offering original and limited-edition cels  from his work with Warner Bros. and elsewhere.  </P> <P> Smith added that he is also attempting to steer the gallery's direction more  toward original, local art. Among the earliest beneficiaries is Irish-born  artist Amanda Watt, whose bright, energetic still-lifes spill excitedly off the  canvas and onto their surrounding frames.  </P> <P> But in the three years of the Tower Gallery's existence, Smith said, he's  watched local galleries struggle to find an audience and survive. In the last  year, he said, two Ventura Boulevard galleries, L.A. Art and Gallery Nicole,  went out of business.  </P> <P> "It's kind of a shame," Smith said. "I would welcome other galleries in the  vicinity. It would be good for the Valley."  </P> <P> The Tower Gallery, at 14523 Ventura Blvd., is open 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. weekdays,  11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Saturdays, and noon to 6 p.m. Sundays.

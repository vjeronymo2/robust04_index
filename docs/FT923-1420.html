			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Two in three mothers work ALMOST two thirds of women with dependent children are in work or seeking work, according to the 1991 General Household Survey, released today. The survey shows that single people living on their own account for more than a quarter of households in Britain, and that 70 per cent of parents with children under five use some form of child care. The figures are among preliminary results from the survey released today by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys. The survey, the most authoritative guide to households in Great Britain, is based on interviews with 19,229 adults in 9,955 households. The size of the average household in Great Britain has decreased from 2.91 in 1971 to 2.48 last year. That has largely been caused by the increasing numbers of single-person households, up from 17 per cent in 1971 to 26 per cent last year. The growth in one-person households is caused partly by the ageing of the population: just over 60 per cent of these single-person households consisted of an adult aged 60 or over. The most common type of household is a married or cohabiting couple with no dependent children - 36 per cent. A quarter of households consist of two adults with dependent children and 9 per cent are single-parent families. The average number of children in homes of all types with dependent children has remained stable throughout the 1980s at 1.8. The proportion working or seeking work among women of working age with children has increased from 49 per cent in 1973 to 63 per cent last year. The increase is even more marked for those with a child under five: up from 27 per cent in 1973 to 47 per cent last year. The survey shows the importance of child care for families with children: 28 per cent of parents with children aged between five and 11 used some form of child care during the year, including school holidays and term time. For those with children under five, the figure was 70 per cent. The commonest form of child care for children under five is nursery school (21 per cent), followed by unpaid family and friends (20 per cent), private or voluntary schemes (14 per cent) and a paid child minder or nanny (9 per cent). Only 1 per cent used child care at work. Ownership of consumer durables has continued to rise in spite of the recession, according to the survey. The biggest year-on-year rise was for compact disc players - 27 per cent of British households owned one last year, up from 21 per cent in 1990. There were further surges in ownership levels for video recorders and microwave ovens: 68 per cent owned a video (64 per cent in 1990) and 55 per cent a microwave (50 per cent in 1990). Ownership remained static for cars (67 per cent), washing machines (87 per cent) and televisions (98 per cent). However, there was a further switch to colour TVs from black and white (down from 5 per cent to 4 per cent). There was a small, but not statistically significant, rise in the number of households owning a personal computer - from 20 per cent in 1990 to 21 per cent last year.

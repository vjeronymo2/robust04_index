			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Move to counter tribunal delays THE government yesterday moved to counter delays in the industrial tribunal system, but the proposals immediately came under fire for being inadequate. The employment bill, due to come before parliament in the autumn, will contain legislation allowing those who chair industrial tribunals to sit on their own rather than with two lay members in particular categories of cases which together account for about 25 per cent of hearings. More than half of the cases brought to English and Welsh industrial tribunals - the independent judicial bodies that settle disputes mainly between employees and employers about employment rights  - had waited longer than five months for a first hearing by last month. The tribunal chairman or chairwoman has legal qualifications and is aided by two lay members with practical experience in industrial relations. One is drawn from a pool nominated by employers' organisations and the other from a pool nominated by employees' organisations. The government also said it has offered more women and black people appointments as lay members. The new appointments will raise the proportion of women from 24 per cent to more than 27 per cent, while ethnic minority representation will rise from 3 per cent to more than 4 per cent. However, Mr Patrick McLoughlin, employment minister, said the figures were still too low. The number of cases brought has increased sharply in recent years because of legal changes, the decline of collective bargaining and the growing willingness of unions to represent their members at tribunals. Mr Stephen Cavalier, a partner in Brian Thompson and Partners, the firm of solicitors most active in tribunals, said more resources should be spent on the system and added: 'This measure is not sufficient to deal with the delays endemic in the industrial tribunal process.' The Confederation of British Industry said it would oppose any move to excessive legalism in the system.</p>

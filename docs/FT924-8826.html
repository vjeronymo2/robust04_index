			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Focus on dollar DEALERS are certain to focus this week on whether the dollar can continue its rise against the D-Mark and break through the DM1.60 barrier, writes James Blitz. Last week, the dollar's ascent to a high of DM1.5965 confirmed predictions that there would be a gradual rise in the wake of Mr Bill Clinton's election as US President. Some analysts believe that DM1.67 or DM1.70 could be reached before Christmas, but others wonder whether the rise will take place that quickly. Economic indicators this week will give clues to the scale of the US recovery. The October producer prices figures, due out tomorrow, are expected to show stable inflation. This will encourage the market to invest in the 10 year note auction and 30 year bond auction due tomorrow and Thursday. According to Mr Mark Brett, investors will be attracted by the high real yields on Treasury bonds, averaging 5 per cent, which is historically high. The dollar/D-Mark rate could get a further boost as investors buy the bonds. In Europe, attention will focus on the British chancellor's autumn statement, due on Thursday, which is expected to outline the government's economic strategy in more detail. Sterling rallied to a close of DM2.45 against the D-Mark last week, following the government's victory in the vote on European union held in parliament. Analysts believe there is no likelihood of a cut in official German rates at this Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting. Bundesbank council members have hinted in recent days that an easing of policy is unlikely. However, the Bank of France could cut its intervention rate for the second time this month when it holds its securities repurchase tenders today and Thursday.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 13.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Activity rules. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  To ensure that simultaneous auctions with our preferred simultaneous stopping rule close within a reasonable period of time, an activity rule is likely to be necessary to prevent bidders from waiting until the end of the auction before participating. Where we decide to employ an activity rule, we will seek one that (1) moves auctions along at an appropriate speed, (2) provides bidders with sufficient flexibility to pursue a wide range of alternative bidding strategies, and (3) is simple and clearly understood by participating bidders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. When the Commission employs a simultaneous stopping rule, our preferred activity rule will be the three stage rule proposed by Professors Paul Milgrom and Robert Wilson. Under this rule, the minimum activity level, measured as a fraction of the self declared maximum eligibility, would increase during the course of the auction. The auction would be divided into three stages. During the first stage of the auction, bidders would be required to be active on licenses encompassing at least one-third of the MHz-pops for which they are eligible. In the second stage, bidders would be required to be active on licenses encompassing at least two-thirds of the MHz-pops for which they are eligible. In the third stage, bidders would be required to be active on licenses encompassing 100 percent of the MHz-pops for which they are eligible. Bidders under this rule would be required to meet these activity levels to retain their desired eligibility. A shortfall in activity would reduce eligibility levels accordingly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. The Commission retains the flexibility to choose among activity rules, other than the three stage Milgrom-Wilson rule, on a case-by-case basis. These include: (1) A Milgrom-Wilson rule with one or two stages, (2) a rule that requires bidders to be active on a single license, (3) a rule that requires that a bidder's activity level remain within a single range throughout the action, (4) a rule that replaces the maximum allowed bidding levels in the Milgrom-Wilson rule with a bidding premium for exceeding those maximums, or (5) a combination of the foregoing rules. We conclude that a waiver procedure is necessary in conjunction with a Milgrom-Wilson activity rule. Under our preferred option, bidders will be permitted five automatic waivers of the minimum activity requirement during the course of an auction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bid withdrawal and default penalties.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If a high bid is withdrawn prior to the close of a simultaneous round auction, the Commission will impose a penalty equal to the difference between the withdrawn bid and the amount of the winning bid the next time the license is offered by the Commission. No withdrawal penalty will be assessed if the subsequent winning bid exceeds the withdrawn bid. If a winning bidder defaults after the close of such an auction, the defaulting bidder will be required to pay the foregoing penalty plus an additional penalty equal to three percent of the amount of the winning bid the next time the license is offered by the Commission or three percent of the amount of the defaulting bidder's bid, whichever is less. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17. In the case of open outcry auctions, the Commission may choose not to impose any penalty for bid withdrawal during the course of an auction and instead rely only on the default penalty to discourage insincere bidding. The default penalty will be assessed if a bidder fails to make the down payment on a license, fails to pay for a license or is disqualified after the close of an auction. In connection with single round bidding, only the basic penalty (and not the additional three percent penalty) would generally apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 18.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Release of Bid Information. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We will announce bidder identification numbers and bid amounts during the course of an auction, but not the identities of bidders, to avoid potential manipulation and collusion among bidders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 19.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Delay, Suspension or Cancellation of Auction. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  By Public Notice or by announcement during an auction, the Commission may delay, suspend or cancel an auction in the event of a natural disaster, technical obstacle, evidence of auction security breach, unlawful bidding activity, administrative necessity, or for any other reason that affects the fair and competitive conduct of the competitive bidding. In such cases, the Commission may, at its sole discretion, resume the auction starting from the beginning of the current or some previous round or may cancel the auction in its entirety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Pre-Auction Procedures and Bidder and License Qualification <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 20. To streamline the processing of auction applications and ensure that bidders and licensees are qualified, we are adopting the following procedures. Usually, no less than 75 days before each scheduled auction, the Commission will release a Public Notice announcing the auction. The initial Public Notice will normally contain information such as the licenses to be auctioned and the time, place and method of competitive bidding to be used, including applicable bid withdrawal procedures and penalties, stopping rules and activity rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The Point of Departure and Our Hopes    The first year of Prime Minister A. Slezevicius' government  is drawing to a close. Undoubtedly, Lithuania's current social  and economic situation depends largely on objective reasons. A  deep crisis has enveloped all states of the former Soviet Union  and countries in its zone of influence without exception.  However, it is no less obvious that a country's situation also  depends on the wisdom, competence, and subordination of  government institutions, on the so-called subjects of the  management system.    The vital hopes of Lithuanian inhabitants which they pinned  on the new government (formed by the Lithuanian Democratic Labor  Party, which won the elections) were substantiated. First of  all, people expected that the declines in industry and  agriculture, which came to light after the declaration of  independence and the introduction of hasty and ill-considered  reform, would be prevented. They also hoped that the government  would manage to halt the drop in living standards. Lithuanian  inhabitants placed particularly large hopes on more effective  fights against crime, corruption, and shadow structures plaguing  the country.    We would be biased if we overlooked the positive efforts of  the current government to direct Lithuania's economic and social  development toward a positive outcome, and, first of all -- the  introduction of the litas, the restraint of inflation, the  vitalization of political and economic relations with foreign  countries, and so on. However, have the expectations of  Lithuanian residents been justified, if only partially, over  this past year?    We are also raising this question because the political  opposition is always ready to transform the accumulated social  tensions and mistrust into ultimatums demanding early Seimas  [parliament] elections, which, we are convinced, would only  aggravate our country's social situation even more.    That is why, in the name of Lithuania's future and its  citizens' concord, it is important to assess the work  accomplished by the government and its subordinate structures  and the country's current economic and social situation  objectively, without any embellishments or cover-ups. This must  be done not to pass judgment on the government's activities but  to search collectively for more effective resolutions to the  current situation on the basis of the conducted analysis.  <H5>  II. The Fall Syndrome </H5>   Beginning its work, the government understood the difficult  condition of Lithuania's economy and the people's low living  standards. [passage omitted]    The new government managed to halt the decline in people's  living standards. According to the Statistics Department, the  average monthly increase of prices and tariffs for consumer  goods in 1993 was 9.2 percent, while that of the average monthly  wage was 10.7 percent. Real wages, which dropped by 69 percent  in 1992 against those in 1990, were already stabilized in early  1993 and began to grow slightly thereafter. The average wage in  November was approximately $64, that is, it rose by $36 in  comparison with February.    One must also state, however, that the living standards of  the majority of Lithuanian people remain unjustifiably low, and  that positive changes fail to eclipse the generally depressing  picture. The comparative analysis allows us to draw the  conclusion that the larger half of the employed population in  Lithuania received lower wages than the real subsistence minimum  (170 litai).    We hardly have any reason to state that a positive  breakthrough has occurred in the so-called policy of culture  (incidentally, in the organization of education, science, and  health care).    The criminal situation has not yet been stabilized, and the  number of unsolved crimes has not been reduced. [passage  omitted]    In our opinion, the key reason for the current social  situation and its possible deterioration in the future is the  continuing dangerous decline in Lithuania's industrial and  agricultural production. For example, in 1993, sales of  industrial production plunged by 46 percent, those of cattle,  poultry, and milk -- by 30 and 12 percent, respectively. The  volume of construction and retail turnover skidded by 40 and 37  percent.    Thus, there is a basis for stating that the decline in  industrial and agricultural production is continuing and even  gaining momentum, and that the so-called "bottom of the pit" has  not yet been reached. This fact is also dangerous in terms of  hiding in itself and bringing ever closer an outburst of the  most painful effect -- mass unemployment. In 1993 alone, hidden  unemployment in industry effected about 335,000 people.  [passage omitted]    III. Looking for Ways Out    One of the key reasons for the crisis we are experiencing is  that the laws of a command economy ceased to operate in  Lithuania, while those of a market economy have not yet begun to  function. This is a peculiar "death zone" from which one can  get out only by applying special tough measures of state  regulation. The liberalization of prices under conditions of  macroeconomic instability and a high level of monopolistic  capital have highlighted the position of the monopolistic  capital that overshadows the emerging shoots of an open market.  The power of the Energy Ministry, whose price policy is leading  producers to bankruptcy, or the monopolistic dictate of food  processing enterprises to farmers could serve as examples.  Meanwhile, the essence of state regulation or antitrust measures  is that a flexible financial and credit policy should create  equal conditions for competition among different economic units.    Positive moves in improving people's social situation are  largely associated with the introduction of the litas and a  tough monetary policy. However, there are also some shadow  elements in this sphere of economic policy. It need not be  reiterated what negative effect the artificially high litas  exchange rate exerts on Lithuania's industry. The current  credit system may have the most negative effect on producers.  Actually all enterprises are indebted and driven to bankruptcy  by force by remarkably high credit interest rates, and they are  choking in the financial policy loop. Given the fact that a  large part of the current budget revenues (more than one-third)  comes from industrial enterprises, we can understand what is in  store for Lithuania if the activities of banks destroy the  financial matters of industrialists. We do not mention the loop  of financial settlements on Lithuania's agriculture which is no  less painful.    At the same time, we are convinced that there are certain  reserves for a more rational utilization of the organizational  possibilities of the monetary and fiscal policy. First of all,  this applies to the necessity of implementing radical and  well-considered reform of the financial and credit system. The  analysis of various draft laws regulating the financial process,  which are either in preparation or under review, shows that they  are drafted without a unified approach or system. [passage  omitted]    One must admit with regret that thus far we have only talked  about reform in the tax system. Our analysis of the delayed  draft law "On the Principles of Taxes" has revealed that it was  created without a well-considered concept. The absence of the  latter is also responsible for the ambitious debates on the  declaration of incomes. One could add that tax laws are drafted  without coordinating them with the law on banks, tariffs, and so  on. One must also admit that the current government has  appeared incapable of properly controlling the collection of  taxes, by leaving a large share of the state budget to shadow  structures, the so-called uncontrolled free trade, and corrupt  and impudent officials.    Undoubtedly, the privatization of industry and agriculture  could also be ascribed to the unexhausted reserves for improving  Lithuania's economic and social situation. The fact that former  governments arranged the privatization of state assets as a  campaign of property distribution is a well-known fact. There  have been several public statements that the privatization of  state property for investment coupons is economically  ineffective.    Despite the carelessness and obvious mistakes in privatizing  the state property, no program for the upgrading of reform was  drafted, the experience of this process was not analyzed and  assessed critically, and the remaining unprivatized assets were  not inventoried. [passage omitted]    Other unutilized possibilities should also be mentioned.  Little was accomplished in developing small and medium-sized  businesses. The faults of the monetary and fiscal policy  prevented the influx of foreign investments. The problem of  settlements among economic entities both inside the country and  with partners in the CIS was not resolved. Foreign policy  related to the national economy was conducted rather  ineffectively. The free trade agreements among the Baltic  states and with Belarus and Russia were not properly applied.  The drafting of the concept of economic restructuring was  protracted, to say nothing of its implementation. It is  actually impossible to conduct a flexible customs policy without  a clear concept of restructuring.    Everyone understands the important role played by the  competence of government officials, and an honest understanding  and performance of duties in the state's life and the  functioning of its structures. The world knows a number of  examples when these traits decided the defeat of a serious  crisis. Is everything being done to achieve the impeccable  level of such traits and duties, even under the current cultural  conditions? Are plans for the training of government officials  responsible enough? There are serious grounds to doubt a  positive response.    IV. The State's "Achilles' Heel"    It is necessary to deal with agrarian reform separately.    In its April 1993 statement, the current government noted  aptly that agrarian reform was most often conducted by  administrative methods through imperfect laws, that it was much  too politicized, that the ill-considered restoration of land was  going on under the cover of reform, and that former economic  structures were heedlessly destroyed. Therefore, unpromising  small farms measuring from 7 to 8 hectares began to emerge.  What can be their future and role in Lithuania's economy?    Being aware of the advantages of large and technologically  well-equipped farms, nevertheless, the government lacked  determination in correcting the forerunners' mistakes. The  actual reason for unsuccessful agrarian reform begun by the  former Supreme Council was its goals which were incorrect in  principle. The restoration of land was turned into an end in  itself. Unfortunately, even after the current government  upgraded land reform and the law on property restoration, the  restitution of land has remained the same goal in itself.  Attempts to introduce conditions for land ownership proved  futile. The trouble is that the privatization of land was not  included in agrarian reform as its integral part. Thus far,  agrarian reform has not been directed at creating an  economically more effective and competitive agricultural system.  [passage omitted]    It should be stressed that the ill-considered and  erroneously  implemented Lithuanian agrarian reform not only ruins production  but also sets people against each other. Even farmers are more  opposed to the government today than landless peasants.  Instances of social discord, as the effects of unwise economic  and social decisions, are becoming more frequent in Lithuania's  rural areas. Such conditions cannot be ignored because they are  one of the key sources of general social tension and political  opposition, as well as of disappointment and apathy in Lithuania.    By mobilizing all intellectual potential, it is necessary to  return to the basic laws on agrarian reform. A seriously ailing  countryside also poses a threat to Lithuania's nation and  statehood.  <H5>  V. Lithuania, Were Are You Going? </H5>   We repeat once again: There is no reason to believe that the  one-year activities of A. Slezevicius' government alone are  responsible for the current situation. We should hardly doubt  the fact that his government sincerely tried to fulfill its  duty. It is unlikely that a coalition government could improve  the situation if the former legacy with its structural,  functional, and mental basis remained.    There are serious grounds to state that thus far ministries  and other offices have not become centers of the state's  intellectual and organizational activities that could exert  essential and qualitatively new influence on the strengthening  of statehood. [passage omitted]    We claim that reform in the bureaucratic government system  inherited from the past has become protracted, and that the  entire state system of economic management remains seriously  sick, with new symptoms of the disease emerging.    In general, thus far, there has not been any more definite  vision of the lines along which the Lithuanian nation should  develop its statehood. What are the social goals of the  restored state? Will the "free market" continue to expand, and  will the so-called libertarianism (civilized anarchy) take root?  Will Lithuania orient itself consistently toward the model of a  state of social accord, welfare, and citizens' democracy? Will  it always glance at other states and copy their manners,  stereotypes, and norms, or will it, nevertheless, show more  determination in looking for the forms of self-awareness  (self-organization) that are more suitable to our identity and  national character, and that would strengthen not only the  chances for the survival of the Lithuanian nation, but also for  its more extensive contribution to world culture?

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Early privatisation plea to 'save' threatened coal pits A LARGE section of the coal industry could be saved by early privatisation and by a government attack on the 'duopoly' exercised by the electricity generators, says a paper published by the Institute of Economic Affairs yesterday. Professor Colin Robinson, writing in the Economic Affairs magazine yesterday, says the government has taken virtually no steps to privatise coal since the idea was first mooted in the mid-1980s. The article comes amid growing concern that attempts by British Coal to license off mines it no longer wants are unlikely to result in more than a handful of pits being operated by private-sector companies. Prof Robinson argues that any sensible form of privatisation has been made difficult by the government privatising electricity supply first and establishing just two generation companies out of the old Central Electricity Generating Board. The paper says the government's objectives should be to create competitive coal and electricity markets. It adds: 'Such steps are the key to coal privatisation and the survival of an efficient coal industry in Britain. They will almost certainly happen one day, for the protection of electricity consumers. But will they be taken in time to save the British coal industry?'</p>

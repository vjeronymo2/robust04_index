			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Serbs look to Yeltsin's enemies IN SPITE OF stepped-up sanctions and the threat of military intervention, Serbs still believe that Russia will wrest them from the clutches of the west. Serb leaders are rooting for the victory of their communist-nationalist counterparts in Russia over President Boris Yeltsin in the referendum set for April 25. They have fostered ties with Mr Yeltsin's fiercest opponents, who make frequent visits to Belgrade and Serb-held territories in Croatia and Bosnia. Serbia appears convinced that the US, faced with a choice between Bosnia and Mr Yeltsin, will not force Russia to oppose Serbia, its traditional ally and favourite of Russian nationalists. Remaining defiant even amid threatened sanctions, Serb commanders pressed on to mop up remaining pockets of Moslem resistance in eastern Bosnia. Diplomats believe that, after Srebrenica, Serb forces will seize control of Gorazde and Zepa, the last two strongholds to the south. Belgrade radio, in the grip of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, yesterday railed at Mr Yeltsin after Russia abstained from a vote in the UN Security Council on a new package of draconian sanctions on Serbia. 'Russia's abstention is nothing more than the shameful heeding of a western diktat and the unprecedented interference in the internal affairs of Yugoslavia,' said the radio, which frequently denounces Mr Yeltsin as a traitor to Russia and the Orthodox world. 'The UN resolution apparently was adopted before the referendum on April 25 because the west is afraid that it will not win after Yeltsin falls,' said the radio. Mr Nikola Koljevic, a leader of the self-styled Bosnian Serb state, said on Belgrade radio at the weekend: 'If the Serbs are punished for Srebrenica, we will have to reveal the secret pact made with Mr Vitaly Churkin, Yeltsin's special envoy to former Yugoslavia, before the referendum is held.' Mr Koljevic hinted that Serbia could help topple Mr Yeltsin if their 'Orthodox brethren learned the truth about the Bosnian game', said the radio, dismissing western outrage about Srebrenica as an 'unprecedented case of media manipulation'. 'Serb military and political chiefs see the current situation as a revival of the first world war and the Great Powers configuration,' says a western diplomat. Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, often warns that the war in Bosnia is the beginning of the third world war and believes Russia will take a stand against the west in the Balkans. 'Many wars have begun in the Balkans without Russia, but not one ended without Russia getting involved,' Mr Bozidar Vucurevic, a lorry driver turned leader of the self-styled Serb state in Bosnia, said recently. 'I am waiting for the day when Russia will air drop aid packets to the Serbs,' said General Milan Gvero, deputy Commander of Bosnian Serb forces. Serbian television devotes far more attention to the power struggle in Russia than to the war in Bosnia. Strapped for cash after two years of war and 11 months under UN sanctions, the television has only two foreign correspondents. They are both posted in Moscow and constantly crowing about any setback for Mr Yeltsin. Despite the official ire and venom unleashed on Mr Yeltsin, Serb leaders have even gone so far as to invite 'patriotic Russian forces' to intervene in Serbia. 'Help us escape from the ghetto and destroy the dungeon in which the hellish powers have locked us,' said a letter to Russian parliamentary deputies from Serbian politicians and Orthodox Church leaders, recently published in Vecernje Novosti, a Belgrade daily. 'Let your boats sail the waters of the Danube and the Adriatic. Let your planes appear on our skies. . . Russia was always together with Serbia and will be from the Pacific to the Adriatic.'</p>

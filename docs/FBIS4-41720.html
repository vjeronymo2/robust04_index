			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The second round of Tajikistan peace talks, which  began in Tehran 10 days ago, ended this morning and the two  sides reached some agreements on ways to implement a cease-fire.    During this round of talks, held in our country's Foreign  Ministry Institute for Political and International Studies since  last Saturday under the auspices of the UN secretary general's  envoy, the two sides signed a joint communique today, stressing  the need to abandon hostility and accept national  reconciliation. Although the communique has not specified a  timetable for implementing the agreements reached, the two sides  have stressed the importance of implementing the cease-fire,  halting illegal detention, and stopping any offensive operations  and troop movements in Tajikistan and along its borders.    Also in this communique, the representatives of the  Tajikistan government and the opposition groups have reached  some agreements on the next round of talks in Islamabad and  discussion on the issues related to the mechanism of controlling  the cease-fire. The agenda of the second round of Tajikistan  peace talks includes four main axes of establishing a  cease-fire, a general amnesty, return of the refugees, and  holding elections. The two sides, however, agreed to  concentrate the main talks on the cease-fire control mechanism.  [passage omitted]</p>

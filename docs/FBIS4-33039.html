			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Cesar Chaman Alarcon] </F>   [Text] Bagua Grande -- Bertrand Dufourcq, secretary general  of the French Foreign Ministry [title as published], said here  yesterday that important French business groups are interested  in investing fresh capital in Peru, especially in the areas of  mining, oil, and tourism.    He added that one factor of interest to French investors is  the process of economic stabilization that Peru has experienced  for approximately two years.    Dufourcq said: "My country recognizes that the government of  President Alberto Fujimori is carrying out a courageous policy,  which often has social consequences, but we are convinced that  Peru is on the right path."    He then noted that in the mining field, French investors are  gathering information on the gold mines in the Peruvian mountain  range with a view to investment in the very near future, and  that some contracts for oil exploitation had already been signed  with the government.    Regarding tourism, Dufourcq said he is aware that an  important French group is studying the possibility of investing  in the construction of a hotel infrastructure in our country.    He added: "Peru has a richness and diversity in its natural  environment as do very few countries in the world, and therefore  has all the necessary conditions for developing tourism."    He also noted that France, as Peru's top creditor, is  fulfilling a very important role in the process of renegotiating  the Peruvian foreign debt.    He added: "This cooperation effort is part of the financing  we provide for social development projects, especially in  running water and sewer systems in the poor districts of Lima,  in Cusco, and in the northern part of the country."    Dufourcq made these comments after visiting schools in the  provinces of Jaen (Cajamarca) and Utcubamba (Amazonas) with  President Alberto Fujimori.</p>

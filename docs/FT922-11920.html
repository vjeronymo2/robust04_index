			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Book Review: A century in singles THE BRITISH CONSTITUTION NOW By Ferdinand Mount Heinemann Pounds 18.50. 289 pages If you like puzzles, study the following sentences and guess whose passionate hand underlined the words printed in italics. Here goes: '. . . an American can know that he has certain individual rights which stand above ordinary laws, things that he cannot be made to submit to by any law . . . It is the medieval doctrine over again, a supreme law that overrules the law-making of men, but with the written word of the Constitution in place of the uncertain theories of Natural Law.' Not a clue? The extract is from Lord Radcliffe's 1951 Reith lectures, entitled The Problem of Power. Radcliffe argued that power could be safe only under certain conditions - conditions which were increasingly unlikely to be found in Britain. A copy of the book was passed from its original owner to Ferdinand Mount in the early 1980s. Now try this second extract. Again, the italics represent underlined words. Alluding to the separation of powers, Radcliffe argues that James Madison, one of the US constitution's founding fathers, 'starts, of course, with the . . . assumption that the very definition of tyranny consists in accumulating all powers in the same hand . . .' Still no idea? One more: 'With . . . single-chamber government and with executive and legislative combined, the security of what used to be called constitutional rights is a frail thing.' The underliner is, we are told, Mrs Margaret Thatcher. She gave the paperback to the author, commending in particular the passages she had marked. 'I mention all this,' writes Mr Mount, who served as head of Mrs Thatcher's policy unit from 1982 to 1984, 'to demonstrate that the most robust Tory of our times . . . was painfully aware of how vulnerable our institutions were and of how the old checks and balances, rudimentary and informal as they might have been, had been eroded and debased'. He might, but does not, draw the contrast with the present public position of Mr John Major, whose remarks during the recent election campaign gave the impression that he finds every detail of Britain's constitution absolutely perfect. Mr Major would do us a favour if he read this book. It is not a reformer's rant. It is rooted in the conservative tradition. To put his mind at rest, he may be assured that Mr Mount is deeply sceptical of proportional representation, and rejects any grand settlement. He talks instead of a slow aggregation of piecemeal improvements, spread over perhaps a decade or more. As the prime minister might put it, the trick is to reach your century in singles. Mr Mount reviews the history of reform. He also debunks the notion of absolute parliamentary sovereignty in a unitary state. This is inherent in the works of the 'three great simplifiers' of modern British constitutional theory - Walter Bagehot, A V Dicey and Sir Ivor Jennings. Their writings inform those who defend the existing system, one of whom is the education secretary, Mr John Patten. The author gives him short shrift: ''All power to parliament' is thus Mr Patten's cry, faintly but unnervingly reminiscent of Lenin's 'All power to the Soviets' - and not without the same fraudulence, since both slogans mean in effect 'All power to the government or governing party.' ' In truth, it is not quite so bad as that. Mr Mount's account of how power is actually exercised tells a gentler story. He finds, against the conventional wisdom, that the monarchy has a useful future constitutional role, if only as a leader of opinion. The cabinet is not the source of all power; the prime minister is not omnipotent. Government departments are baronial estates; the administration is the product of baronial assertions of power, overseen by a strong Downing Street. As to the likely development of the constitution, Mr Mount distinguishes between what is already on the way with what will probably come in the middle and further distances. The judiciary, whose compliant acceptance of the government's authority in my view helped to sustain the elective dictatorship, is shown by Mr Mount to be coming back to life, at least as protector of the individual. Within parliament, we see 'a gradual but still timid peeping forth of backbenchers' confidence'; in consequence, select committees, 'look increasingly like a fixture'. The latter's response to the 'ever growing bulk' of European legislation will determine parliament's future as 'an effective critical forum'. He sees as soon likely the incorporation into UK law of the European convention on human rights and the establishment of a Scottish assembly 'on minimalist lines'. In the longer term, he postulates a constitutional entrenchment law, a supreme court and a fixed term of, say, four years for future parliaments. Clearly, this is no revolutionary manifesto, but it sounds more attainable than any such. It is written with light grace and good humour. You do not have to be a nut about the constitution to enjoy reading it. You may become one if you do.</p>

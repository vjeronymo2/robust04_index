			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Opposing within The strengths and weaknesses of the British government's often theatrical battle against the European Union's social dimension were fully displayed in Brussels yesterday. Mr Michael Portillo, the aggressive new employment secretary, denounced a proposal to offer unpaid leave to fathers upon the birth of their children. But he had nothing to say about the potentially much more significant European works council directive on employee consultation, finally passed after nearly 15 years of debate. His silence on works councils is a consequence of Britain's decision to 'opt out' from that directive, which means that it has excluded itself from the final discussion. All the same, many of the 100-plus UK companies which will be affected by the directive through their European subsidiaries are likely to include their British employees in its requirements. And several employers' organisations have privately regretted that Britain was not on the inside, fighting to amend the proposal. Whereas the UK's opt-out has generally been unproductive for Europe's employers, its persistent niggling from within on dubious legislation has been more helpful than critics acknowledge. The new balance between social protection and job creation that is now evident in Brussels is the result of several factors including high unemployment and the changing political balance in several capitals, but it also owes something to British truculence. Mr Portillo acknowledges those positive new signals about the social dimension and accepts that most of the directives now under discussion are the last gasps of an earlier era. He would probably even accept that in the areas of UK labour market legislation where Europe does play an important role - such as health and safety, and gender equality - it has produced acceptable results. But in his determination to wield the opt-out again on relatively minor measures, such as paternity leave, he is making a faulty analysis of British interests. As Britain's limited success in revising the Acquired Rights directive has shown, fighting from within can work.</p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN LEFT;  </P> <P> WHAT ARE THE CONTRAS UP TO NOW?;  </P> <P> A DECISION NOT TO DEMOBILIZE HAS WASHINGTON'S PRINTS ALL OVER IT.  </P> <P> The Contra leaders in Nicaragua are now claiming that it was the recent strike  by Sandinista civil service employees that caused them to halt the  demobilization and keep at least 10,000 Contras under arms. Government workers  rebelled against incoming President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's savage  austerity measure to crush the public service sector unions and there is even  some evidence that the Sandinista leadership, palavering with Chamorro, was  taken aback by the militancy of the workers.  </P> <P> But anyone believing that until the strike the Contras were prepared to lay  down their arms is misreading the brutal political hand that the United States  is continuing to play out in Nicaragua.  </P> <P> The benign interpretation of current White House policy is that the United  Nicaraguan Opposition's electoral victory of Feb. 25 closed the books on U.S.  sponsorship of the Contras. All that remained was the arrangement of a brisk  schedule for their demobilization and re-entry into civilian society. Operating  within these rosy assumptions, the American press reported last week the solemn  assertions of government officials that $30 million of the funds President Bush  is seeking for Nicaragua should be earmarked for the Contras. Otherwise, they  might break out of their camps to "forage" for themselves and their families.  </P> <P> The premise here is that U.S. policy is essentially one of encouraging  "reconciliation" in Nicaragua, with the Sandinista army remaining in place but  gradually dwindling in size.  </P> <P> There is as little reason to believe this premise as there was in trusting that  President Reagan would respect the Boland Amendment of 1984 (which cut off  military aid to the Contras) or that Bush would honor the bipartisan accord of  April, 1989 (which promised that in return for humanitarian aid, there would be  no further Contra attacks).  </P> <P> What the Nicaraguan election in fact prompted was a U.S.-backed Contra  invasion. More than 10,000 armed Contras crossed back into Nicaragua from  Honduras in the aftermath of the Chamorro government's victory. But the  mainstream American press has been almost entirely silent about what these  Contras have been up to. Less tactful observers, like the courageous members of  Witness for Peace, have been sending north a stream of detailed reports of  Contra outrages: the terrorizing and kidnaping of peasants, burning of  agricultural cooperatives, destruction of equipment and supplies. To take just  one example: On April 28, more than 600 Contras devastated the co-op at  Mancotal, destroying and stealing everything in their path and vowing that the  land would be returned to its former owners.  </P> <P> These reports also stress that the marauding Contras are freshly uniformed and  armed. So who armed them? The lack of curiosity on this important matter is  extraordinary and the answer is obvious.  </P> <P> The Contras have not laid down their arms to any substantive degree, and the  United States is making no effort to pressure them to do so. On Monday, an  Irish army officer just back from the United Nations force in Nicaragua said  that in the security zone on the border with Honduras, only 19 Contras out of  more that 4,500 had disarmed before he went on leave.  </P> <P> The U.S. claim that the Contras need another $30 million to prevent them from  having to "forage" -- that is, terrorize co-ops -- is not credible. As with the  humanitarian aid last year, the money is required to keep them in place as an  armed force.  </P> <P> It is an absolute constant of U.S. policy in the Americas that Washington  abhors any military force not under its control or patronage. Realistic  analysis suggests that so long as a Sandinista army remains, the United States  will make sure the Contras are not demobilized. Washington's aim is not for a  democracy in which the Sandinistas might return to power in 1996 or "rule from  below" before that time, but for the re-establishment of the old National  Guard. The policy is not reconciliation but the systematic destruction of the  Sandinistas as a decisive force in Nicaragua.  </P> <P> Money for the Contras and U.S. pressure that they stay assembled in a  designated enclave play the same role as money for the government -- i.e. the  armed forces -- of El Salvador: extirpation of the possibility of reform. And  if President Chamorro is not sufficiently resolute in playing her part? Who is  not to say that we will not see someone like Vice President Virgilio Godoy,  buttressed by the Contra force, calling for U.S. help in countering the  Sandinista threat to a "fledgling democracy"?  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The National Space Agency of Ukraine has reached an  agreement with the well-known European company Matra-Marconi  Space on the latter's participation in the satellite program  Lebid. The European Community has allocated $400,000 for its  development. Such well-known Ukrainian enterprises and  institutes as Dnipropetrovsk's Pivdenmash, Kiev's Kvant and  Saturn, and Symferopol's Musson have also been included in the  program. It is expected that, through the cooperation of the  French, British, and Ukrainian firms, a communications satellite  will be sent into geostationary orbit in 1997, most probably  from the Baykonur launch facility. This was reported today by  the national Space Agency of Ukraine.</p>

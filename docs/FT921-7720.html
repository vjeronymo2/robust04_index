			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / WEU row fuels Danish debate on EC treaties DANISH politicians are tying themselves in knots over whether the country should join the Western European Union (WEU), which will carry out defence operations which may be required as a consequence of the European Community's common foreign and security policy. The issue is so sensitive that it may have an influence on the outcome of a referendum on the Maastricht treaties to be held on June 2. Polls in January indicated a 60-40 majority in favour of signing the treaties although there was a high number of people undecided. However, by February 17 a business newspaper opinion poll showed a steep decline in support for European union. According to the poll, political union was opposed by 36.2 per cent and supported by 35.5 per cent, with 27.6 per cent undecided. At present, a majority of the eight parties represented in the Folketing, including the minority coalition Conservative and Liberal parties, are in favour of political union, but a majority (not consisting exclusively of the same parties) are also against membership of the WEU. Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the foreign minister, finds the situation ridiculous. He argues that if one supports political union, including the common foreign and security policy, then it does not make sense to refuse to join the WEU, which will be responsible for executing decisions taken under the auspices of the common foreign policy. The WEU is seen as the forerunner of a common European defence and military policy. As such it raises hackles on many Danes who are otherwise sympathetic to European political union. The opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP), which holds 69 out of 179 seats in the Folketing, is the key party on the WEU issue. The SDP is officially in favour of ratifying the Maastricht treaties, but its supporters are not. Antipathy to defence co-operation is strong within the party. The SDP argues that nothing must be done which can weaken Nato's role in European defence. Hence, it is opposed to Denmark joining the WEU, of which all other Nato members except Norway, Turkey and Greece are members. The WEU issue has come to a head in the party, however, for reasons which appear to have little to do with the merits of the issue and more to do with a clash of personalities between the party's leader, Mr Svend Auken, and a prominent colleague, Ms Ritt Bjerregaard. In January, Ms Bjerregaard declared in a television interview that the party was bound to reconsider the question of WEU membership. Her statement acted like a red rag to a bull and sent the party leadership into a spasm. Not only is the leadership against membership: it will not allow the issue to be discussed. The serious aspect of the situation for those supporting the Maastricht treaties is that the SDP is so divided under the weak leadership of Mr Auken that it is unable to give a clear, strong lead to its supporters as the June 2 referendum approaches. It is possible that this could lead to an upset in the poll and an interesting situation, to say the least, for the the European Community.</p>

			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE BEST COMICS OF THE DECADE SELECTED BY THE EDITORS OF  THE COMICS JOURNAL (FANTAGRAPHICS BOOKS: $12.95)  </P> <P> The first installment in a projected two-volume set, "Comics of the Decade"  examines the graphic work being done outside the mainstream newspaper strips  and comic books, stressing original approaches to storytelling and imaginative  visual styles. Bill Griffith ("Zippy the Pinhead") offers a slyly satirical  self-portrait of an artist torn between the conflicting claims of aesthetic  purity and commercial gain.  </P> <P> Matt Groening and Jules Feiffer provide delightfully acerbic commentaries on  the follies of contemporary American politics and culture. However, not all the  work in this anthology attains that level of excellence: Howard Cruse's rather  heavy-handed portrait of a repressed clergyman lacks the insouciant charm of  his "Wendel" series; John Callahan's cartoons about alcoholism seem merely  crude. "Best Comics" proves that the comics needn't be restricted to the  homogenized humor of "Garfield" and "Hagar the Horrible".  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOSTAGES  </P> <P> We hereby express our appreciation of a most humane article "The Forgotten  Hostages: Lebanese" (Part A, April 2). The perceptive writer, Marilyn Raschka,  has dealt with a thorny subject that is much ignored by the international as  well as Lebanese media.  </P> <P> Indeed, in the general anarchy, thousands of innocent Lebanese citizens have  been abducted not only because of their religion, but also because of their  courage to speak their minds, their peacemaking efforts or their prominence in  the community.  </P> <P> One of the forgotten hostages is our father, Sarkis Zeitlian, a Lebanese  editor-in-chief of Armenian origin who was kidnaped on his way to work on March  28, 1985, at a time when many Lebanese and foreign journalists and media  persons disappeared.  </P> <P> In our ordeal we are comforted to know that there are still people who care to  remember the forgotten hostages and the anguish of their families.  </P> <P> ZEITLIAN FAMILY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Chrystia Feeland report: "The Tragedy and the Irony of </F> Village Conservatism"]    [Text] To the amazement of outside observers Ukraine's  election campaign is not being fought primarily on economic  issues. But, if Ukraine is to have any hope of averting the sort  of disaster foreign experts predict, then the day after they  take up their seats, the new MPs will have to face up to the  issues they have been avoiding on the campaign trail.    On its own, Ukraine's economic plight is cause enough for  serious international concern. Ukraine's macro-economic record  -- the worst in the former Soviet Union -- is so dreadful that  the beleaguered officials of the International Monetary Fund and  the World Bank in Kiev have taken to raising their spirits by  counting the inventive new ways Ukrainian officials are  constantly discovering to destroy their economy.    But what makes fragile Ukraine particularly important now is  its increasingly hostile relationship with Russia. Russians --  ranging across the political spectrum from Lenin to Solzhenitzyn  -- have always seen Ukraine as an integral part of "Greater  Russia". As Russian foreign policy hardens in the aftermath of  the elections there in December and in reaction to Russia's own  economic travails, Moscow's pressure on Kiev to re-submit to  Russian rule has become stronger.    Ukraine's economic collapse makes it more difficult for Kiev  to resist; at the same time, the nation's political  determination to remain independent is growing stronger. This  makes Ukraine a particularly volatile partner in what is already  a tense relationship, hence the CIA's gloomy prediction earlier  this year of a "probable" conflict between the two Slav giants.    It is in the cities, with their greater voting power, that  the outcome of Ukraine's election will be decided. There, the  race is far more competitive and a new political class,  representing a fledgling middle class rather than the entrenched  ex-communist nomenklatura, could emerge.    Ukraine's tragedy is that the uncomplaining resilience of  its  villages is likely to help keep its inept government in place.  The irony is that it is the villages, with their tradition of  hard- working self-sufficiency, which could be the driving force  behind a Ukrainian economic revival -- if Ukrainian voters are  ever able to elect a government with the courage and skill to  initiate reforms.</p>

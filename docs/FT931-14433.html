			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / No rain falling on this parade: Washington is enjoying the party despite Iraq THE last time the leader of the 'out' party took over the White House, national attention was divided. Jimmy Carter spent most of his last morning as president hanging on the telephone, waiting to hear news from Tehran that the aircraft carrying the US hostages had taken off. In what was seen in the US as a last, cruel twist of the knife by Ayatollah Khomeini, it was nearly two hours into Ronald Reagan's presidency before the word was received in Washington. There is a similar sense pervading Bill Clinton's inaugural week, with the US-led coalition engaged in air raids and dogfights in Iraq, with President Saddam Hussein continuing to blare defiance and with President George Bush, looking grim and serious, tucked away at Camp David in Maryland's Catoctin mountains, issuing his final orders. Mr Clinton, indeed, might well set a record for a new president by having to authorise more offensive action in a distant part of the world within hours of moving into the Oval Office. But the late night briefings by General Colin Powell and his more carefully phrased public utterances on Iraq are not spoiling his party. If the first two days are anything to go by, this may prove one of the more memorable celebrations of the transfer of power. Sunday's 'reunion' on the Mall, against the floodlit backdrop of the Lincoln Memorial, was everything it was cracked up to be. Surely never has there been a finer fireworks display, rattling windows all across the nation's capital, while not even Mr Reagan, a product of Hollywood, could assemble the galaxy of entertainment stars performing in a president-elect's honour. Finally, Mr Clinton seemed to catch the sense that he was about to become president. For once he was not operating on what has become known as Clinton Standard Time, in which the timing of all appointments and engagements is strictly notional. He was only four minutes late arriving at the Lincoln Memorial from Charlottesville, Virginia, on Sunday and did not drop in for a chat at McDonald's on his dawn run down Pennsylvania Avenue yesterday morning. Mr Clinton's words also matched the spirit of the moment. In a mercifully brief speech, he invoked Lincoln's 'better angels of our nature' to guide his presidency. Earlier, in Monticello, he was asked by a young boy what cabinet post he would give Thomas Jefferson if he were alive. 'I'd make him secretary of state, then Al and I would resign, so he could become president again,' he said. Mr Gore, more predictably, talked of Jefferson's environmental qualifications. Yesterday was Martin Luther King Day, a national holiday in most of the country. The great civil rights leader had delivered his immortal 'I have a dream' speech from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, and yesterday morning Mr Clinton paid further tribute to him in an address at Howard University, Washington's overwhelmingly black college. His widow, Mrs Coretta Scott King, had her mind on something else yesterday as she criticised the raids on Iraq. Perhaps it was her way of reminding Mr Clinton that there is a real and troubled world out there that not even the most fabulous of Washington parties can conceal for more than a few days.</p>

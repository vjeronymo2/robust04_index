The announcement followed a statement by former Russian  Vice-Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar that the merger of the two  systems is detrimental to Russia.    Myasnikovich said that "the statement by Yegor Timurovich  reflects the position not of the whole government of Russia, but  of one of its members, though very influential."    Myasnikovich stressed that during the talks in Moscow on  January 5 with Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich,  Gaydar did not rule out the possibility of the integration of  the two monetary systems. He said, however, that this is a long  process and may take up to six months.    The Belarusian vice-premier said that Belarus is doing  everything possible to agree the tax, banking, customs and  foreign economic policies. The talks on these issues were in  progress during the entire last year. On many of them  agreements have been reached. "We are working within the  framework of an agreed tax, licence and quota policy,"  Myasnikovich said.    He stressed that the merger of the Russian and Belarusian  monetary systems aims at removing barriers in trade and monetary  cooperation that emerged after Russia seceded from the rouble  zone, starting the chaotic development of independent monetary  policies in CIS states.    In a joint statement signed on January 5, the heads of  government of Russia and Belarus stated that the necessary  preliminary work for merging the two monetary systems has been  completed.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ross Tieman report: "MPs Warn Over 18 Billion Pounds </F> Nuclear Clean-Up Cost"]    [Text] Deep disquiet over the estimated 18 billion pounds  cost of decommissioning Britain's nuclear power plants has been  voiced by the powerful cross-party Commons Public Accounts  Committee.    ln a hard-hitting review of the industry's provisions, the  committee calls for a "visible, guaranteed fund to provide for  decommissioning." Members suggest that the non-fossil fuel  obligation, a 1 billion-pound-a-year levy on consumers' bills  intended to fund decommissioning in England and Wales, is little  more than a tax on consumers.    They say that while Nuclear Electric, the biggest  state-owned  atomic generator, seems confident that it can meet its  obligations, Scottish Nuclear will become technically insolvent  in the next financial year without further government  intervention.    Alan Williams, Labour MP for Swansea West and a member of  the  committee, said: "The Government is clearly charging a 10 per  cent tax on electricity to pay for decommissioning nuclear power  stations. It is costing the consumer 1 billion pounds a year.  Until 1998, when this levy effectively ends, the consumer will  pay this plus 17.5 per cent VAT (value added tax], leading to  soaring bills."    The committee's report, The Cost of Decommissioning Nuclear  Facilities, will increase pressure on the Government to draw up  a broad brief for its overdue review of the nuclear industry's  future. It will also add to the difficulties Nuclear Electric  faces in its efforts to win planning consent to build a  pressurised water plant in Suffolk, alongside the Sizewell B  plant now nearing completion.    The two leading nuclear power companies last night defended  themselves vigorously. John Collier, the chairman of Nuclear  Electric, said: "We know exactly how to decommission all Nuclear  Electric's power stations." The company's total decommissioning  liability, in real terms, was 2.7 billion pounds, he said.  "We're right on track to meet that bill without any need for  subsidy or extension of the levy."    Robin Jeffrey, the chief executive of Scottish Nuclear,  confirmed that his company would become technically insolvent if  it failed to tackle its problems. But he added: "We have every  confidence that cost-saving projects, which include the dry  storage of spent fuel and a new approach to decommissioning  known as Safestore, will ensure that the question of technical  insolvency will not arise."    The Public Accounts Committee looked at decommissioning  costs  right across the industry. Its report notes that accounting  provisions in the nuclear generating industry rose from 1.1  billion pounds in 1987 to 3.76 billion pounds in 1989. Planned  privatisation was subsequently abandoned because investors were  worried about the industry's liabilities, including  decommissioning. By 1992, the total cost of closing and removing  civil nuclear plants and cleaning up associated radioactive  contamination was estimated at 18 billion pounds for the four  companies--Nuclear Electric, Scottish Nuclear, British Nuclear  Fuels and AEA, the former Atomic Energy Authority.    The process involves removal of fuel and ancillary plant,  followed a century later by dismantling and burial elsewhere of  the reactor.    MPs are concerned that although Nuclear Electric says it has  about 1.5 billion pounds of deposits for decommissioning with  the National Loans Fund, some of the provisions have been used  to fund construction of Sizewell B. The company insists that  revenues from Sizewell will be used to top up the provisions.</p>

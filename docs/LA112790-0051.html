			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Time Is on Their Side: Mick Jagger and his longtime girlfriend, Texas model  Jerry Hall, were married on the Indonesian island of Bali, the Rolling Stones  press agent said Monday. The wedding took place Wednesday and few details were  available, except that it was a traditional Indonesian ceremony, and the  couple's two children, Elizabeth, 6, and James, 5, attended, a spokesman said.  </P> <P> "Even we didn't hear about it until today, so they have clearly managed to keep  the wedding very secret," said the spokesman. The couple have been together for  more than 10 years. British-born Jagger was divorced from first wife, Bianca,  in 1979. Hall has not been married before. Alan Dunn, Jagger's longstanding  friend and the Rolling Stones' tour director, was the best man. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

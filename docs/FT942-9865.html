			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Chunnel threat to languages Sir, So much for the French efforts at language preservation. A Radio 4 item on the Eurotunnel opening ceremony included two announcements, in French, from the public address system aboard the train. The first thanked the passengers for using 'le Shuttle', the second trusted that they had enjoyed the facilities 'au club car'. M S White, 19 Statham Close, Luton, Beds LU3 4EJ</p>

			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> HUNTSMAN MAY UP ARISTECH BID  </P> <P> Salt Lake City investor Jon Huntsman, in his relentless pursuit of Aristech  Chemical Corp., said today he expected to sweeten his bid for the chemical  company to at least $27 a share -- topping a white knight offer by Aristech's  chairman and Mitsubishi Corp.  </P> <P> Aristech Chairman Thomas Marshall and the Japanese trading company had launched  an $845-million, or $26-a-share, bid for the Pittsburgh-based polymers and  chemicals company two weeks ago.  </P> <P> Marshall and Mitsubishi joined forces in an effort to keep Aristech out of  Huntsman's hands. Aristech had previously rejected a $25-a-share offer  announced in October by the Salt Lake City businessman.  </P> <P> Aristech's deadline for submission of bids for the company expired Monday.  Huntsman requested today that the deadline be extended to at least Feb. 14.  Huntsman said he planned to submit a sweetened offer as soon as possible after  completing a review of Aristech's documents.  </P></p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / International Company News: Trelleborg plans rights issue TRELLEBORG, the Swedish mining and metals group, yesterday became the fifth large Swedish group to announce a rights issue in the past two weeks when it unveiled plans to raise SKr1.2bn (Dollars 149m) from shareholders to cut debts. It also aims to sell its Munksjo paper and packaging unit, or float it on the stock exchange, in a move which could raise several billion kronor. The group also wants to sell its remaining shares in Svedala, the mineral processing and transport unit. The plans were announced as the group sank deeply into the red with a first-half loss after financial items of SKr796m, against a SKr117m profit in the same 1992 period. Depressed metal prices led to a fall in turnover, to SKr10.97m from SKr11.55bn, while there was an operating loss of SKr131m, against a SKr29m profit. Trelleborg said in July it planned to cut debts by SKr3bn over the next 12 months. The rights issue will be on a one-for-two basis at SKr30 per share. The group has net debts of about SKr10bn and has already sold assets worth SKr1.4bn this year. Incentive, the industrial and investment group controlled by the Wallenberg family, said rationalisation and increased focus on engineering businesses helped it lift first-half profits to SKr273m from SKr212m, excluding associated companies. The increase was achieved despite a fall in sales to SKr2.74bn from SKr2.93bn, amid weak conditions in the group's main Nordic and west European markets. If income from Incentive's stakes in Asea, Electrolux and Esab is included, profits climbed to SKr780m from SKr654m. The group said construc-tion groups Munters and Tour &amp; Andersson and materials handling group Hagglunds Marine had performed well despite difficult market conditions. Hasselblad, the camera company, had a more difficult time, largely because of a weak European market.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Rift fears knock 5 pfennigs off sterling STERLING dropped nearly five pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday as foreign exchange dealers were thrown into confusion by the new rift between the UK Treasury and the Bundesbank. The emergence of a new fault-line in Anglo-German relations pushed the pound down to DM2.4770 in Asian trading on Wednesday night and the currency bottomed out at DM2.4680 in Europe yesterday. The pound later closed in London at DM2.4750, down 4 1/4 pfennigs on the day and 16 per cent below its former central parity in the exchange rate mechanism of DM2.95. Against the dollar, it closed down nearly 5 cents at Dollars 1.7365. In New York later, where the dollar was generally stronger, the pound finished at DM4.7300 and Dollars 1.7405. Dealers believe the immediate outlook for sterling and other European currencies depends on whether the Bundesbank cuts interest rates at its council meeting today. Earlier this week, a member of the central bank's council said there would be no German rate cut for six months. But a gradual reduction this week in Bundesbank dealing rates in the German money market has fuelled new optimism. A number of leading participants in the foreign exchange market predicted more sterling falls in the absence of a German rate cut and any clarification of UK economic policy. 'Until this latest row, I had pencilled in a low of DM2.40,' said one leading currency fund manager in London. 'But colleagues now believe sterling could drop to DM2.30 unless a coherent UK economic strategy materialises.' The unrelieved strength of the D-Mark kept the Spanish peseta close to its ERM floor and forced Spain's government to deny rumours of another devaluation. The peseta closed against the D-Mark at Pta70.42, close to its ERM floor of Pta72.62. Sterling's weakness has triggered new fears of a devaluation of the Irish punt, which hit a high of Pounds 1.055 yesterday. Irish officials have said the punt should not strengthen above Pounds 1.05 because of the close trading relationship between the UK and Ireland. Spain accuses Moody's, Page 10 Currencies, Page 35</p>

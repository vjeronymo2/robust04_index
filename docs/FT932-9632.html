			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Clark 'overturned' Iraqi sales advice MILITARY ADVISERS working on the vetting of export licences to Iraq were told by the chairman of their committee at the start of 1990 that Mr Alan Clark, then the minister for defence procurement, was 'gung-ho' on defence sales and did not necessarily accept their advice on security, the Scott inquiry heard yesterday. Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Glazebrook, a retired army officer who was a member of a Ministry of Defence working group which vetted export licences, said that Mr Clark had overturned the working group's decision not to recommend a licence for Iraq for a computer-based automatic vehicle locating system manufactured by Terrafix, a company based in Stoke-on-Trent. The Terrafix system was one of three sensitive applications that were being discussed and was turned down initially by the working group in February, 1990, just months before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Lt-Col Glazebrook said: 'We believed we had good reasons to turn all three down.' Later Mr Barrett reported that the minister had upheld two of the refusals but that the advice on the third, the Terrafix system, had been overturned. Lt-Col Glazebrook said that in another case officials from the government's defence export sales department tried in April 1990 to overturn a recommendation not to export sophisticated radar jamming equipment, S500, made by Plessey. Plessey's supporters said the system would be used for training purposes. Lt-Col Glazebrook disagreed. 'I turned to the company's own brochure and it was clear that the the company listed the system's training capability as the 'last of its attributes',' he said.' We had given our decision but this appeal was coming back again and again, wearing us down.' Lt-Col Glazebrook remarked that after the invasion of Kuwait a Royal Signals officer, when he heard that the Iraqis had acquired an earlier version of the Plessey radar jamming equipment, said to him: 'Oh, bloody hell. We've got nothing to touch that.' The hearings continue next week.</p>

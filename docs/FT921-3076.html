			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (25): Will the soldiers return to barracks? / A look at the political scene in the run-up to the elections ANY concern that Nigeria's transition to civilian rule is going badly tends to be tempered by astonishment that it is going at all. Many Nigerians doubted the soldiers' promise to return to the barracks by the end of 1992. Indeed, some still wonder if General Babangida will find a way of staying on. But, as the president observed in his New Year address, 'events so far have proved the cynics wrong'. If the election timetable is followed, presidential primaries begin in May. National assembly elections take place in November, followed by the presidential poll on December 5. On January 2, 1993, General Babangida presides over a formal handover and Africa's most populous nation, under military rule for 22 of the years since independence in 1960, will become a democracy. It is perhaps not surprising that concern about the nature of the transition is usually expressed with caution or circumspection. Decree 19 makes it a serious offence, punishable by a five-year jail sentence, to oppose the transition programme. This has not deterred all the critics. Some voices have been raised - notably from the Civil Liberties Organisation and the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights, both Lagos-based, and there have been some outspoken commentaries in the Nigerian press. They have had targets aplenty, for the transition has been flawed from early on. In 1987, thousands of former politicians and government office holders were banned from politics, in the hope of creating a 'new breed' of legislators unsullied by the corrupt, pork-barrel and outright vote buying that had characterised Nigerian politics. Later in the year, the government decided that it would recognise only two political parties, in an attempt to prevent the resurgence of parties which depended heavily on an ethnic base - Hausa-Fulani, Yoruba or Ibo. In October 1989, the government turned down all 13 organisations applying for recognition, on the grounds that 'old lines of cleavage - ethnic, geopolitical, religious and class - surfaced in bold relief', as President Babangida put it. Instead, government presided over the creation of two new parties - the Social Democratic Party (SDP) 'a little to the left', and the National Republican Convention (NRC), 'a little to the right.' Baba Gana Kingibe, an articulate former ambassador from Borno, SDP chairman, and Chief Tom Ikimi, a Lagos-based architect who heads the NRC, do their best to make this distinction apparent. Yet the manifestos of the two parties, drawn up by government officials, are almost identical. Both support the structural adjustment programme - although few candidates for any office, from either party, can bring themselves to say so on the hustings. Both propose pressing ahead with the Ajaokuta steel project, a multi-billion dollar white elephant. Both advocate self-sufficiency in agriculture. The NRC offers free primary and secondary education, the SDP says it is committed 'ultimately' to free education at all levels. The result is that Nigeria's election campaigns so far have had little if any ideological debate. There are no substantial policy differences, nor are there clear regional or religious boundaries between the NRC and SDP. Although sometimes labelled 'north and Moslem' - the NRC  - and 'south and Christian' - the SDP - the results of the gubernatorial election show how misleading this would be. Lagos, for example, would have been a comfortable win for the SDP had this been the case. It would be fair to say that the NRC has a northern slant, its opponents a southern bias. But to win the presidency, both parties must demonstrate countrywide support: present rules demand that the successful candidate requires not simply a majority of the vote, but 25 per cent of the poll in two thirds of the states. Government officials maintain that this clause (which applied in the 1979 and 1983 presidential elections), coupled with the imposed two-party system, has helped break the traditional mould of Nigerian politics. This seems optimistic. 'Ironically, the coalitions and alliances formed under the party umbrellas are influenced by the very factors - including hidden loyalties to old parties - which disqualified the 13 political organisations in 1989,' notes a Kaduna lawyer. Recent developments have further undermined the credibility of the process. Government officials insist that the only way to prevent electoral fraud is to continue with the open ballot system (tried and abandoned by Kenya) under which voters line up for counting in front of a poster of their favoured candidate. Nor was the credibility of the process enhanced last December, when President Babangida lifted the ban on former politicians. Not because it had failed, he said, but because 'the new leaders had adequately adapted to the political setting and the parties had been adequately institutionalised'. Many Nigerians believe differently: 'The banned politicians simply could not be kept out of the arena,' says one 'new breed' politician. 'They have the money, influence, and experience - better have them in the open than behind the scenes.' Why, then does he take part at all? His explanation probably reflects the views of many participants: 'I know the transition is flawed,' he explains, 'and I know it could fail. But if I and others like me don't work for its success, our fears could become self-fulfilling prophecies.' It is from the ranks of the 'old breed' that most of the front runners for the presidency have so far emerged. Of the dozen or more NRC candidates so far declared, three are singled out by a senior northerner who will be involved the selection process: Umaru Shinkafi, former internal affairs minister and head of intelligence during the 1979-83 civilian government, Dr Lema Jibrilu, a prominent industrialist, and Adamu Ciroma, a widely respected former Central Bank governor and ex-minister. Still waiting in the wings is Shehu Musa, former secretary to the 1979-83 Federal Government who was in charge of last year's national census. 'I would tip Ciroma,' says one NRC stalwart, 'but he may have offended the army' - a reference to some trenchant comments on the soldiers' shortcomings. No fewer than 38 (at last count) presidential hopefuls have thrown their hats in the presidential ring. Among those leading the field is Chief Olu Falae, former cabinet secretary and ex-finance minister in the administration, whose close involvement with the unpopular economic reform programme may well prove an electoral liability. Retired Major-General Shehu Yar'adua, an influential Kaduna based businessman, may not win the nomination, but is seen as one of the kingmakers. But just as Shehu Shagari emerged as a compromise candidate in 1979, so it might again prove with the current favourites for office. 'The trouble is,' said one retired politician, reviewing a list of front-runners, 'those who are capable may have too many enemies, and those with few enemies are not up to the job.'</p>

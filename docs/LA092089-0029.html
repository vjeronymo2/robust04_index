			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YORBA LINDA OKS NIXON BIRTHDAY HOLIDAY  </P> <P> The birthday of former President Richard M. Nixon will become a holiday for the  employees of Yorba Linda, the Orange County city that claims Nixon as its  native son.  </P> <P> "We're not here to judge history, we're here to recognize it," said Mayor Henry  W. (Hank) Wedaa.  </P> <P> Wedaa said that despite Nixon's resignation from the presidency in 1974 under  the cloud of the Watergate scandal, the proposal to commemorate his birthday  has met with warm response.  </P> <P> "Since the resolution was proposed, I have been amazed at the positive response  that's come forth," he said. "Many of us have felt it was time for a holiday  for President Nixon, and the time has come."  </P> <P> The City Council voted 5 to 0 Tuesday night to declare a city holiday each Jan.  9, the day Nixon was born in a Yorba Linda farmhouse in 1913.  </P> <P> "Fifteen years have elapsed since President Nixon's resignation and history has  shown the importance of his presidency, particularly with respect to his  brilliance in foreign policy," the resolution said.  </P> <P> Wedaa, who proposed the measure two weeks ago, said he hoped that the Richard  M. Nixon Presidential Library now under construction in Yorba Linda will  schedule special events for the holiday.  </P> <P> The response from Nixon to having a city holiday in his honor is "that he's  pleased," Wedaa said.  </P> <P> Nixon's birthday will be an added holiday for Yorba Linda's 100 to 110 city  employees, costing the city an additional $10,000 a year, according to  Assistant City Manager Bruce E. Channing. It will be celebrated beginning in  1990.  </P> <P> Police are exempt from the ordinance.  </P></p>

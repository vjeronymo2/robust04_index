			<p>BFN     [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, 16 Apr (AFP) --  Samuel Ruiz, the bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas bishop,  today announced that the Zapatista National Liberation Army  (EZLN) has asked him to seek mechanisms leading to a resumption  of the dialogue with the government, the first phase of which  concluded on 2 March.    At a news conference, Ruiz (the mediator in the dialogue)  said he had received "verbal" communication from the EZLN, and  he added that it is just "a matter of days" before the  resumption of the dialogue would be announced.    On 2 March, the government forwarded several proposals to  the  EZLN in an effort to end the armed conflict in the Mexican state  of Chiapas. At that time, the guerrilla organization began  conferring with its grass-roots organizations, but the  conferences were suspended following the 23 March assassination  of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio.    Ruiz did not rule out the possibility that a renewed  dialogue  could still fail to result in the signing of a peace agreement,  but he added that the new sessions would allow the two sides to  review proposals "and, in turn, determine how we might best be  able to set out on a firm footing."</p>

			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt sees some life in special situations LATE-closing bourses gave only a limited accolade to the turnround on Wall Street yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff, and early closers were unwilling to move on Thursday's change of direction there. FRANKFURT relied on special situations, the brightest, Porsche, extending its recent gains to close DM41 higher at DM609, up from DM490 at the end of May. Elsewhere in consumer goods the discount retailer, Asko, fell DM30 to DM753 and the fashion house, Escada, by another DM6 to DM317, the latest in a succession of 1992 lows. Mr Alex Magona of MAP Securities said that Porsche's gain was in non-voting stock, ruling out stakebuilding and the takeover stories which came so easily to dealers' lips yesterday. He thought, however, that US car industry indications that the worst was over may have helped the company. Asko, which has been going through changes at board level, stands at a discount to the retail sector; it is on a p/e of under 10 for 1992 compared with something over 15 for Karstadt, the sector leader which suffered an earnings downgrade from Deutsche Bank researchers this week. In general, equities stayed flat, volume falling from DM5.3bn to DM4.6bn and the DAX index closing 0.46 higher at 1,782.27 after a 0.79 fall to 710.20 in the FAZ at midsession. Falls on the week were 0.4 and 0.6 per cent respectively. PARIS closed slightly easier, having been in negative territory throughout the week. The CAC-40 index, which had touched 1,920 earlier in the session, finally ended 0.55 lower at 1,928.29 in turnover of some FFr2.3bn. The index lost 2.7 per cent over the week. One of the main features of the day was the 3.5 per cent rise in Pernod, advancing FFr56 to FFr1,628 in the absence of news. Elsewhere, St Gobain reversed Thursday's fall to gain FFr15 to FFr569 following positive comments at the annual meeting. Scheider weakened FFr3 to FFr663, but off the day's low of FFr659. The electrical engineering group and its subsidiaries have had a hard week, during which the company cut its profits forecast for the year, and since Monday the shares have lost 13 per cent of their value. MILAN drifted disconsolately lower, reflecting Italy's political deadlock and the market's technical problems with screen trading. The Comit index fell another 2.43 to 474.94, down 2.6 per cent on the week in turnover still painfully low after Thursday's figure of only L61bn. In industrials, Italcementi fell L380 to L13,620 ahead of its forthcoming rights issue. In the banking sector, San Paolo was among the worst performers, closing at L10,850, down from L11,275 on Thursday and L12,200 at its initial share placing in March. ZURICH recovered with Wall Street, the SMI index closing 11.1 higher at 1,879.9, down 2 per cent on the week. Chemicals were the first to gain, Roche certificates rising SFr30 to SFr3,340 and topping the active list, but banks and insurances soon joined in with SBC SFr6 higher at SFr269 and Winterthur SFr80 better at SFr3,190. BRUSSELS ended higher with late buying of the retailer, GIB, helping to lift the market. The Bel-20 index put on 1.70 to 1,211 but lost 1.1 per cent on the week. GIB saw keen foreign interest and its shares gained BFr16 to BFr1,478. Other movers included Solvay, down BFr150 on profit-taking to BFr13,250. AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency index rose 0.2 to 129.5 but was down 0.7 per cent on the week. Turnover was Fl 515.4m. KLM improved 70 cents to Fl 40.00, helped by some buy recommendations. In one, Hoare Govett said that the carrier has benefited from good traffic levels in one of the industry's worst years and forecast good medium-term earnings growth. MADRID was unimpressed by the May inflation data and the general index lost 0.86 to 248.41, a 2.4 per cent drop on the week. Reports that Telefonica's annual meeting had to be suspended after disruptive action by employees contributed to a Pta10 fall to Pta1,085. STOCKHOLM declined for the seventh consecutive session, the Affarsvarlden General index closing 10.0 lower at 943.5 for a 3.1 per cent drop on the week. Meanwhile, COPENHAGEN saw a recovery in its hard-pressed insurance stocks, Hafnia A rising DKr15 to DKr175 and Baltica DKr40 to DKr565 as the all share index rose 0.81 to 326.10, 1.6 per cent down on the week.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JUN 12  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Hourly changes   Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close  1162.79  1163.18  1162.94  1162.84  1163.17  1164.84  1167.03  1167.48  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            Day's High  1168.17            Day's Low  1162.01  -----------------------------------------------------------------------       Jun 11        Jun 10        Jun 9        Jun 8        Jun 5      1162.52       1174.58       1174.96      1177.48???   1181.18  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).        ???

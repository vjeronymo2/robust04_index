			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Share shock sparks new insight into dealing: The case behind yesterday's consultation paper The Stock Exchange's plan to suspend trading in individual companies' shares when there is evidence that price-sensitive information has leaked was prompted by a flurry of dealing activity four months ago in Portals, the manufacturer of banknote paper. On May 10 Portals shares jumped 44p to 679p, when 385,000 shares were traded. The exchange immediately started to make inquiries, as the price jump and the volume of shares traded were unusual for this particular security. The initial investigation was carried out by the exchange's price and media monitoring group. The group is a bridge between the supervision department, responsible for ensuring the exchange's rules are followed, and its surveillance group, whose role is to detect and investigate criminal trading in shares. The group wanted to ascertain whether there had been a leak of confidential price-sensitive information concerning Portals to investors. The company had received a takeover approach - from De La Rue, the banknote printer - but no announcement to shareholders had been made. If some of these purchasers of Portals shares had known of the takeover talks, they might have been insider trading. However, most were probably not 'insiders' in the strict legal sense. More likely is that a group of investors got wind that 'something was up'. They might for example have noticed that Portals shares had been bought by a stockbroker known for making well-timed investments. So although the bulk of these deals were probably not criminal, there was an unequal distribution in the market of information about Portals' prospects. Anyone selling Portals shares at this time might have complained that they only did so because they did not possess the full facts. It was not until four days after Portals received an approach that it made a statement, by which time a further 468,000 shares had been traded. It was another three days before De La Rue was named as a possible bidder, by which time Portals share price had reached 805p. The Portals case provided a first taste for Mr Michael Lawrence - who had joined the exchange as chief executive two months earlier - of official procedures to ensure price-sensitive information is properly disclosed to the market. He was extremely uneasy about the delay between the share price jump and Portals' public statement. He initiated a review of exchange practices, which resulted in the publication yesterday of the consultation document on dealings ahead of the disclosure of price sensitive information. If the new system had been in place last May the chain of events would have been very different. As soon as Portals' share-price movement had breached a set of parameters - fixed on the basis of the normal volatility of its share price and that of other share prices in its sector - a warning would have been transmitted to the market on the exchange's Seaq trading screen. Investors would have been alerted to an exchange probe into a possible leak of price-sensitive information - and that they should take care before buying or selling. Under one of the proposals made yesterday there would also have been a simultaneous lifting of the obligation on market makers, the wholesaler of shares, to deal at the prices they quote on the Seaq screen. Had the monitoring group discovered quickly that there was an innocent explanation for the price movement, the alert would have been lifted. In this case, however, the exchange would have been told either by Portals or the takeover panel, the City body which acts as the referee of bids, that an approach had been made. Portals would have been asked to make an immediate public statement. If it was unable to do so the exchange would have called a halt for 24 hours to trading in its shares, by which time Portals should have been able to make an announcement. Failing that, a further period of suspension would have been insisted on.</p>

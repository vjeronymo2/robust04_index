			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Beijing warns over spending on new Hong Kong airport China last night moved to close off the option of Hong Kong proceeding to build the colony's new airport without agreement when it said it would abrogate any deal made without Beijing's consent, writes Simon Holberton in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the Chinese government said the post-1997 government would not be liable for any expenditure and debt incurred in building the new airport. It also said any contract awarded without Beijing's consent would be invalid after 1997. The tone of the statement, rather than the specific threats, underlined the low point to which Anglo-Chinese co-operation has sunk. The Hong Kong government has consistently denied it would 'go it alone' on the construction of the airport, and has always sought Chinese government approval for any contract which spans 1997. The statement seems to have been prompted by the Legislative Council's approval of an extra HKDollars 1.6bn (Pounds 139m) of finance last week and the government's decision to go to LegCo for a further HKDollars 4.6bn in the coming week. It emerged yesterday that Britain's approach to China last week for a meeting of the Airport Committee - the governmental body set up to discuss the project - got little response. This was in spite of the implicit offer to put more of Hong Kong's money into the HKDollars 160bn airport and related infrastructure development. China last night said that the Hong Kong government's financial plan for the airport and its connecting railway provided for HKDollars 45bn of debt. This was nine times the HKDollars 5bn of government debt allowed for in a 1991 agreement, it said.</p>

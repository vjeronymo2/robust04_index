			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- Japan's steel exports rose in  fiscal 1993 for the third straight year, but the average export  price fell below 70,000 yen per ton for the first time in 20  years amid increased competition, the Japan Iron and Steel  Federation said Monday [9 May].    In the fiscal year ended March 31, the volume of steel  exports grew 26.2 percent to 24.51 million metric tons,  exceeding 20 million tons for the first time in five years, the  federation said.    In yen terms, the average export price fell by 22,800 yen to  69,700 yen per ton as increased competition combined with the  yen's appreciation put downward pressure on export prices.    Exports to China posted a 2.36-fold jump to 6.86 million  tons, while those to Taiwan and South Korea climbed by 19.5  percent and 39.5 percent, respectively.    In contrast to the brisk exports to Asia, exports to the  United States fell for the sixth straight year, sliding by 7.6  percent to 2.22 million tons. In dollar terms, exports  increased by 10.2 percent to 15.80 billion dollars, but fell by  4.9 percent in yen terms to 1.70 trillion yen.    The federation also reported that the nation's steel imports  fell by 2.2 percent in fiscal 1993 to 8.82 million tons,  slipping below 10 million tons for the second consecutive year.</p>

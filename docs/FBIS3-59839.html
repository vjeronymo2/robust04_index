			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid by </F> Muhammad 'Abd-al-Salam in Aden; date not given]    [Text] The house of 'Ali Salim al-Bid, secretary general of  the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] and vice president to 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih, is built on a high hill in the mountains of  Aden that snake around the coastal city. I met him in the house  where he is still in seclusion. A few guards are stationed  around the house and along the road extending to the hills. The  road is unpaved; it is so rough that we almost plunged into a  ravine when the driver of the car that took me to interview  al-Bid did not pay attention to a deep hole which he tried to  avoid.    Some 10 minutes after my arrival in al-Bid's residence his  press secretary Dr. 'Abdallah al-Haw joined us. We talked about  the progress of the Yemeni press and the large number of  publications of which many Yemeni citizens do not know the  names. The publications total 120 dailies and weeklies. The  director of al-Bid's office entered the room and informed me  that the vice president was on his way. A minute later I saw  myself standing in front of this man with thick black hair and  deep set eyes. Signs of exhaustion were clearly evident on his  face. But the years of struggle against British colonialism  together with his colleagues until 1967 have toughened his  resolve and solidity. After greeting me we sat. He asked me  about the AL-SHARQ newspaper, its circulation, and affiliation.  When you sit with al-Bid you feel that you want to draw closer  to him in order to hear what he says in a low voice. When he  answers a question words cascade out of his mouth, almost  unstoppable. He wants to say everything so that everybody will  hear him. He wants to put the facts before the world. He said he  will not return to Sanaa, the Yemeni capital unless the 18  points he submitted to end political confrontation are  implemented. He pointed fingers at one of the ruling coalition  parties accusing it of conspiring to assassinate the YSP  leadership of which he is the chairman. He said he is on top of  the list. In this interview 'Ali Salim al-Bid revealed many  secrets of the current political conflict in Yemen. Nobody knows  how or when will it end.    ['Abd-al-Salam] Your excellency brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid,  YSP secretary general and vice president: Following the arrival  of the new Qatari ambassador 'Abdallah al-Ansari in Sanaa and  after he was received by the Yemeni foreign minister, how do you  evaluate the Yemeni-Qatari relations now and in the future?    [Al-Bid] First, we welcome the arrival of his excellency the  new Qatari ambassador and any other Arab ambassadors to Sanaa.  We are very interested in enhancing diplomatic activity with our  brothers in the GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] states. Our  relations with Qatar are good. We hope they will develop even  further by elevating them to a higher level of action that would  strengthen these ties. We highly appreciate the state of Qatar  and its people, and we hope that the arrival of the ambassador  will start a new phase of activity between the two countries.    ['Abd-al-Salam] Mr. vice president: The Gulf crisis had some  negative impact on Gulf-Yemeni relations. Do you believe that  the clouds that have led to conflict have vanished completely,  or some are still marring the relations?    [Al-Bid] The Gulf crisis is part of the Arab situation; it  is  the focus of attention by many parties. But I hope that we will  deal with our Arab situation with a new vision. We are  responsible for what happens in the various Arab countries; we  are responsible whether we are far or close to these  developments. The deterioration of the Arab situation calls upon  us to review its causes. I believe that the Gaza-Jericho  agreement is a landmark; it calls for a pause by all Arabs. I  believe that this situation will move us to a new, advanced era.  We cannot say...[text missing] But this calls for a greater  debate and discussion among all the Arabs of the question of  responsibilities, including the Gulf crisis and its effects. The  issues are interlined; they should not be separated from one  another. We all in the Arab homeland are paying the price of the  Gulf crisis. We find that our enemies have derived strength from  our weakness. Developments in the Arab arena call for the  adoption of a serious stand and demand that we should have the  capabilities to overcome the crisis. No one should depart from  the Arab course and we should not hold any party in particular  responsible for it. All these developments happened in the  presence of everybody, both those who supported the war and  those who opposed it. The situation has harmed the Arab nation  as a whole; it is our responsibility to address the problem. We  cannot conceal its impact on all of us. This calls for standing  together in order to overcome this situation. I do not think  that anybody who is proud of this nation and its history would  accept this situation without feeling pain and suffering.    I wish we all will succeed and hope to continue to exchange  views, follow up events, work together, and go back to what we  call the fundamentals. For example, we should once again  advocate the fundamentals of Arab nationalism and maintain our  links together as Arabs and as brothers. All this existed some  half a century ago when Arab nationalism was at its peak. But  now Arab solidarity has begun to vanish and advocating it has  once again become a struggle and a national task. We have  reached a situation that calls for adopting a serious stand. The  Palestine problem, as an Arab cause or as an Arab-Israeli  conflict, used to join us together. We now have reached the  point where we call it the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Then it  would be said that we should not be royalists more than the king  so that we will get rid of this difficult trial. If national  commitment no longer exists, what would then bind us together. I  am afraid that the ties that bind us together will weaken if the  nation faced a problem. As a result of this situation it can be  said that the general situation is deteriorating. But I believe  and I am optimistic that deterioration is followed by revival. I  hope that all the resources will be available to us and all the  good people in the Arab nation will demonstration a revival  spirit so that we will continue our struggle and to be proud of  our history and nation.    ['Abd-al-Salam] Your excellency is aware that the Yemeni  unity which you and President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih achieved has  gladdened the Arab nation and Arab governments and peoples. Do  you believe that the basis on which this unity was found are  sufficient to protect it against any political crises that it  might face, or is it in need of new bases in order to provide  greater protection for this unity?    [Al-Bid] In theory and on the basis of documents the unity  is  not suffering from any problems. But the ability to shoulder the  unity's responsibilities has decreased; that is lesser than what  is required to build unity based on nationalist and democratic  principles. But in practice we were incapable of advancing on  the path of unity building. Consequently it has become clear in  the Yemeni arena and to everybody that this situation calls for  review in order to once again arouse the forces. If we remain in  the same position in which we are now and are satisfied with the  unity and democracy slogans, did not take practical steps along  its path, and developed its slogans from being a public rhetoric  and theories into reality, we will find that we have failed our  duty toward our unity and aspirations. Some people look at this  as a national dream. The proponents of any cause should adopt a  national dream for which he should struggle in order to realize.  Some say that this only enables us to escape reality, shifting  from one position to another and leaving the problem outstanding  to be dealt with later. But it is these two ideas that have led  us to this tug of war situation. There are unity and democratic  forces that want to go ahead on this path and have the ability  to do so. Other forces do not have such ability. Consequently  they are impeding our movement and obstructing it. The question  is now raised on a national level. When we were unable to raise  the question in the bodies and within the framework in which we  operated, we were forced to put the matter to the people; it is  the concern of the people after all. Our role was only to sign  on what the people wished. But when we saw that different  concepts are developing in the people's mind--something that  cannot be ignored--we believed that we must once again go back  to our people, to dialogue, to debating issues, and to taking  substantial measures. Our masses accept nothing short of  substantial measures that would ensure for them the ability to  advance and to build this grand Yemen with its 13 million people  and an area of no less than half a million square miles. All the  Yemenis and all the good people are looking forward to this  building. But when the resources are unavailable, efforts to  ensure erecting this building weaken. This creates a situation  in which frustration disappointment prevails. Therefore, we find  that this dream is blurred and facing difficulties. I do not  think that the problem is theoretical. It is due to our  inability to arouse endeavors and to lack of efforts. During the  past three-and-a-half-year period the efforts were not up to the  building level. Some people aspire for ownership but they are  satisfied with the slogans. This is our problem; it is the  problem in many Arab countries. We think that it costs us  nothing to say anything. Demagogy is rampant in politics and in  many Arab situations. Some of us may be think so. Never mind.  And yet we say "no prayer," "Leave it to God." This is a major  task that calls for major endeavor and strong people. We have  confidence in all the good people and our people. We do  everything that might help leveling the path and stay close to  the people's will.    ['Abd-al-Salam] The political scene in Yemen has definitely  witnessed several activities in order to bring views closer  between you and his excellency President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih.  Can you talk about these efforts and the results achieved so far?    [al-Bid] We need no mediation between us, but probably our  people are in need of a mediator between them and their  officials who should wake up and honor their pledges and  commitments. All the efforts that are being made are, of course,  good. We do not need people to (?educate us) because we are  responsible and are aware of the situation. What is needed is  credibility in what we say and announce to the people. This is  what is needed. Mediation is probably in order to clarify a few  things. But things between us are clear and the agreements are  open and clear. The failure to implement them is the cause of  what we are suffering from today. I believe that we have no need  for mediation. If we do not prove our credibility we want  witnesses to testify that we are not up to the promises we have  made.    ['Abd-al-Salam] Can it be said that Qays al-Zawawi's visit  to  Aden was part of the efforts to break the deadlock in the  crisis, or was it a courtesy visit because His Majesty Sultan  Qabus was unable to visit you when he visited Yemen recently?    [Al-Bid] Brother Qays al-Zawawi visited Sanaa and Aden. The  visit, we were told, is in order to follow up the issues that  were discussed during His Majesty, the Sultan's, visit to Sanaa.  Our brethren in Oman are concerned about the situation, and we  appreciate the efforts they are making. They have proposed  nothing specific. The discussions dealt with the situation, the  exchange of views, and development of the bilateral relations.  Yemen claims that the Arabs originated from there. We consider  Yemen to be for all the Arabs. We are not embarrassed nor feel  awkward when any of Arab brothers asks about our situation.  Indeed this makes us very happy. We are gladdened by their  interest in us and their wishes to us to make progress so that  all we will be happy. We are happy to light a candle for Yemen  so that we can diffuse some light also to other Arab arenas. I  believe that this is a brotherly interest that stems from the  desire to develop relations and be reassured about the Yemeni  situation.    ['Abd-al-Salam] It is obvious that the present discord is  due  to party disputes. You have submitted 18 points for the solution  of the crisis and for your return to Sanaa. The GPC [General  People's Congress] responded with 19 points most of them  contrary to yours. This means that the points of agreement are  still far apart. Doesn't your excellency see that these  differences could endanger your historical achievement?    [Al-Bid] First, our historical achievement will be  endangered  if we do not take practical steps to build it, regardless of  whether party issues are raised or not. Issues should be dealt  with from a nationalist standpoint. The points which the YSP  raised were approved by all the other parties that are outside  the government. Those have been condensed into 16 points, which  you can see. We regard these 16 points as containing all the 18  points. They only had them redrafted. The proposed points  reflect all the concerns of the Yemeni people. These were not  party issues. They reflect our fear and anxiety over delaying  taking steps that would strengthen the edifice of freedom and  democracy. It is not a question of political bickering. Every  party expresses itself differently. Perhaps our brothers in the  GPC think that the 19 points are all the problems the people are  suffering from. The people have matured; they can distinguish,  they can understand, and they can eat with their own hands. They  can also distinguish which are the issues that serve them. We  are in favor of the issues that serve the people. We are not  against discussing any subject raised by any quarter. The most  important thing is that these issues should be relevant to the  people's problems; problems of their country; their security;  and their building of a unified state on all the Yemeni  territories. There is need to create a genuine democratic  climate. This work calls for making efforts. We realize that  certain things need time to be implemented, such as growth,  development, and completing building the state machinery. But we  believe that certain urgent measures should be taken that need  no effort on our part, such as the apprehension of outlaws and  terrorists who are causing disturbances for the nation. We  should arrest them and bring them to trial publicly. Those who  reject this demand are not a problem. What do they want those  who reject this demand? For example, we say that army camps  should leave [urban areas] according to the unity agreement. The  people and the major towns are demanding this. They should move  and leave according to the agreement that has not yet been  implemented. I do not think that this costs anything. Therefore,  we believe that certain issues could move. On the contrary,  because the camps are now in a position different from where  they are supposed to be, from where they can defend national  sovereignty. These forces are in a position that is too distant  from the task of defending Yemen. For this reason we can see  that certain issues can be solved. This would build up trust  among the parties and the coalition; it would develop good  relations between the people as well as the feeling that we are  working for them in order to reassure them and create more  stability in the country.    ['Abd-al-Salam] In a recent speech President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih reiterated the term "the red lines" that should not be  crossed. Is there a prior agreement on these lines between you  to ensure the preservation of unity, or is it the present  circumstances that have led to talking about these red lines?    [Al-Bid] I believe that the red line is to ignore peoples'  problems; the red line is to disregard peoples' issues; the red  line is not to build a unified state; and the red line is to  consecrate sectoral mentality; the red line is to impose a  pattern over another; it is not to have sufficient enthusiasm to  establish the unitary state, the "Yemeni Republic." The red line  is also to ignore the existence of others. This is how I  understand the red lines. This is what causes the loss of unity  and eliminates our noble dreams for which we are struggling. You  may ask for clarification, but this is how I understand the  situation. I wish neglecting struggle and disregarding peoples'  problems were a red line because the results will affect all of  us. If we ignore the citizen's problems, we cannot build; if the  state of institutions is not established, there will be no law.  Instability is a red line that will lead to the disintegration  of the unitary state of which we have been dreaming. I wish this  was so. We might differ in our interpretation of this matter.  The red line is the stand on which the people agree; it is to  forsake the unitary state or to try to adopt a method or manner  that will not lead to building unity. To raise a slogan and not  practice what it preaches is unacceptable. I believe that this  is the situation that should prevail. The interest and love of  the country is what should prevail and be the common denominator  binding us together.    ['Abd-al-Salam] Following the Yemeni defense minister's  recent announcement that Yemeni armed forces will stay away from  the current political struggle, does your excellency believe  that this is sufficient for you to drop one of the 18 points,  the one concerning the need to move the army and the armed men  to outside the cities, particularly Sanaa?    [Al-Bid] No, we do not object to [the army] being neutral.  This is our view in the YSP. The armed forces should not be  involved [in politics]. Their position is quite different from  the proposed tasks of building a unified armed forces for the  Yemeni republic. These are two different questions. It is true  that we should not involve the armed forces in political  disputes, but this does not mean that we should adopt a negative  attitude toward building national and unified armed forces  established on scientific basis and on recognized national  standards of efficiency in order to defend national sovereignty.  That is, the two subjects are quite different. The question  concerns the current problem. We should not involve the army in  these issues, that is in debates and discussions. The army  should devote its attention to the country.    ['Abd al-Salam] Recent reports spoke of a large-scale  campaign of assassination against YSP members and cadres that  was recently uncovered, including the assassination of 11 key  leaders. How true is this report?    [Al-Bid] This is a serialized story that began some time  ago;  it is not new. Maybe it is the YSP's lot to make sacrifices on  behalf of others for the sake of unity and democracy. The party  has made major concessions and we spare nothing for the sake of  this country. Such possibilities are often part of hostile  activities and run counter to the activities of our allies. This  is regrettable and we have drawn attention to it sometime  before. I believe that this is proposed even in the 18 points  which we submitted. We must face these situations and put an  end to them. Because there is a proverb that says: "Today it is  with you and tomorrow it will be with your brother." Another  proverb says: "If your brother had a hair cut moisten your  hair." The blade goes from one head to another. We should be  alert. Hostile activities and violations could take place.  Vigilance is required by everybody.    ['Abd-al-Salam] Three and a half years have passed since  unity. Did it achieve anything that would raise the standard of  living of the citizen who have attached great hopes on unity to  realize this goal?    [Al-Bid] The chaos that prevailed during this period has  obstructed progress toward improving the people's life. We have  been supporting unity. We all in Sanaa have struggled for unity,  for order, and for the establishment of the state of law and  institutions. We did not accept the spread of chaos. What has  been happening every day unfortunately was spreading chaos,  weakening the state, and preventing it from imposing its  authority on the Yemeni territories. The situation now is even  worse than what it used to be before unity. There was a  government in Aden and its mechanism was everywhere and in every  central department. But we could no longer administer the  government through which we deal with the citizens' problems,  with development, and with the standard of living.    ['Abd-al-Salam] The unified Yemeni currency which was to  come  into circulation when unity was announced has not been issued.  Has it been abandoned? How do you explain the increase in prices  and the drop in the dinar value?    [Al-Bid] The new currency was part of our agreement, but the  abandonment of many agreements has affected our present  situation. Had all the agreements agreed upon been implemented  during the transitional period we would have found ourselves in  a better position to deal with the issues of the unitary state.  But this failure is now having an impact on the situation. When  we entered into unity the value of the dinar was $3 to the  dinar. Since the day of unity and up to this day the value of  the dollar has become almost 2 dinars. [sentence as published]  This drop happened five times. The drop in the currency value  and the high prices are due to the economic policy.    The economic policy in Yemen since the unity has been  unstable. Some of the activities to which we were accustomed  have been suspended. For example, we used to draw up five-year  plans and annual plans. These have stopped. It has become  apparent that the state is producing a deficit rather than  controlling it and putting an end to it. Smuggling is  continuing. When we come to Sanaa we see goods on display but  most of it is smuggled. There are no official documents showing  that these goods entered the country legally. Many officials are  aware of this situation. If it was not for the protection of  some big fish in the state smuggling would not have continued.    This is the cause of chaos. Smuggling and the smugglers and  those who want to perpetuate this situation do not want a  unitary state, a state of laws and regulations because it would  put an end to the chaos in the economy. A state would lay down  the basis for development, a correct economic policy, and a  policy for currency issuing, dealing with deficit, developing  revenues, expanding development, and creating more job  opportunities rather than more deficit.    ['Abd-al-Salam] Is there a consensus in your party politburo  and central committee on your attitude toward the present crisis?    [Al-Bid] The present attitude is actually that of the YSP  politburo and the central committee. We are accustomed to  reflecting the party's unanimous will. These points represent  the party's politburo on practical issues. But we also have our  own views on the development of the country in general as stated  in our election program, our views as strugglers with a cause in  our country. Our party has submitted these points and welcomes  discussing them and discussing other points as well.    ['Abd -al-Salam] What is your latest attitude toward the  question of returning to Sanaa or continuing to stay in Aden?    [Al-Bid] Really, I do not wish anybody to ask me about  returning to Sanaa because Sanaa is my town and I know when I  have to go there. I went there willingly and I know the way to  it. When my national duty and my responsibility call upon me to  be in Sanaa, God willing I shall be there. When I see no reason  to do so then staying in any part of the Yemeni homeland is a  matter to be decided upon; it is left to be decided upon the day  when the situation calls for our presence. Our presence is  unnecessary when all there is to be done is to focus on a single  issue and ignore the rest.    I hope...there is no reason for the people to tire  themselves. We have before us issues that we must discuss.  Without being serious in Sanaa, the capital of the unitary  state. [sentence as published] I see no reason to discuss where  the human being should be located. The human being is found were  there is work, there is a job, there is a plan, and there are  bodies that work. We shall find our way to Sanaa. After three  and half a years I believe that we can stay wherever we happen  to be; staying close to the people is better. We can at least  comfort them, even if morally. Our citizens and kinsfolk have  suffered a lot in the provinces in the past. We thought that all  the government departments have been busy trying to solve the  citizens' problems throughout the republic, but what we found  was failures. We believe that these failures had a negative  impact on the citizens' life.    We must work with renewed effort and do all we can in order  to pull the country out of this situation, and to stay wherever  we like in Yemen. Where there there is work is where we should  be.</p>

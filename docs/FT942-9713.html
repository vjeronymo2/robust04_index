			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Impossible hurdle for foreign horses in Japan: Only a few races are open to outsiders Sumo, Japan's national sport, has its foreign champions, and most of the country's soccer stars are imported. But in the world of horse-racing, the foreign-bred steed is still shut out from most events. Tomorrow, five foreign horses will run in the Yasuda Kinen race in Tokyo, one of just a few races in Japan that are open to horses from abroad. It will be closely watched, both for the money riding on the horses and for the impact on the industry, which wants to keep the hurdles high for foreign horses. The bets are that one of the five will beat Japan's best for the Y94m (Pounds 618,400) first prize, confirming horse breeders' worst fears that opening more of the country's races to non-Japanese thoroughbreds will lead to foreign domination of a home-grown industry. In spite of pressure from abroad, only five of the more than 3,400 horse races held in Japan each year are open to foreign horses. Even in those five races, the number of foreign participants is strictly restricted; the five running in the Yasuda Kinen will be competing against 10 or so locally bred horses. In the case of sumo, tradition provided a reason for some officials to put obstacles in the path of foreign wrestlers. But Japanese opposition to opening horse racing to foreign competition stems from economic vested interests that have been used to defend other Japanese markets, such as rice. Not only are foreign horses highly competitive, they are about 30 per cent cheaper to raise than Japanese horses. If more races are open to imports, local horses will win fewer awards and their market value will fall, damaging the breeding industry, according to the Japan Racing Association. The Keio Hai spring race last month which was opened to foreign horses for the first time this year, helped to fuel those fears. The four horses participating from abroad easily filled the top four positions. 'Like agricultural products, Japanese horses cannot compete with foreign ones in terms of costs,' says Mr Keiji Matsuo, an official at the Japanese thoroughbred breeder's association, which has 2,353 members. At stake is a total of up to Y100bn in award money that goes to the top five winners in Japanese horse races. Horsebreeders are particularly concerned that Japan's commitment under the Uruguay Round agreement to gradually lower its tariffs on imported horses will hurt domestic breeders. The tariffs, of Y4m per horse, which have been a big obstacle to foreign horses participating in Japanese races, are being reduced by 15 per cent or about Y3.4m by the year 2000. But Japan's horseracing industry is finding it difficult to beat the forces for change. The JRA has launched an eight-year internationalisation programme triggered not so much by foreign pressure as by strong interest among Japanese horseracing fans to see more foreign horses running in national races. 'There are some very high-grade horses running in Sunday's Yasuda Kinen and I am expecting it to be a very exciting race,' says Mr Naoto Hashimoto, a Tokyo businessman who is a keen horseracing fan. The race will feature a thoroughbred owned by Sheikh Mohammed of Dubai, two French horses, one from the UK and one from Hong Kong. Mr Hashimoto believes that competition from imported horses will help raise the level of Japanese horseracing. 'Japanese horses have only competed among themselves, with other horses of the same level,' he says. 'Competing with foreign horses at home will raise the competitiveness of Japanese horses, which could help them to compete more successfully overseas.'</p>

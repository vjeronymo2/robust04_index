			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Labour alleges 'vote-rigging' link Labour last night claimed there was 'an unmistakeable trail' leading to Conservative Central Office over Westminster City Council's alleged 'homes for votes' policy. Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, has written to Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary; Mr John Gummer, environment secretary; Mr David Hunt, employment secretary; Sir Norman Fowler,Tory party chairman; and Mr Kenneth Baker, former party chairman; challenging them to set out what they knew about the policy. It was confirmed yesterday that Wandsworth Borough Council, another leading Tory London council, was under investigation by the district auditor over aspects of its housing policy. Sir Paul Beresford, Wandsworth leader from 1983 to 1992 and now Tory MP for Croydon Central, denied any comparison between the housing policy at Wandsworth and allegations made against Westminster. Ten Westminster councillors and officials - including former leader Dame Shirley Porter - were accused of gerrymandering in the provisional report by Mr John Magill, district auditor, last week. In a new twist yesterday, it was claimed that Westminster offered financial inducements to other councils to take its homeless. Westminster officials are alleged to have approached councils in the north of England in an attempt to cut its waiting lists, but apparently they all refused. Mr Straw said yesterday: 'The public have a right to know how much of Shirley Porter's work was with the complicity, connivance and support of senior national Tories and how far they were simply content to turn a blind eye or deaf ear to what was going on.'</p>

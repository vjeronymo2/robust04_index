			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROFIT AT WORLD'S NO. 2 COMPUTER MAKER DROPS 34%  </P> <P> Fujitsu Ltd., Japan's biggest computer maker, Thursday reported a 34% drop in  profit in the first half of its fiscal year.  </P> <P> The weak results surprised financial analysts who follow the company, the No. 2  computer manufacturer in the world after International Business Machines Corp.  </P> <P> Fujitsu reported that group profit dropped to $204.6 million in the six months  ended Sept. 30.  </P> <P> "We expected a drop in profits, but not so much," said an industry analyst at a  Japanese brokerage.  </P> <P> Fujitsu said the lower profit was due in part to development spending,  including establishing overseas production, and strengthening its sales  structure.  </P> <P> Higher interest rates and special losses, including a drop in the value of its  shares in telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., also  ate into profits, a company spokesman said.  </P> <P> The gloom could spread into the full year ending March 31, 1991.  </P> <P> The company spokesman said a stronger yen and continued pressure from high  interest rates are expected to dampen profits, as is a $47.2-million good-will  payment in connection with its acquisition of British computer giant ICL  earlier this year.  </P> <P> As a result, Fujitsu has lowered group profit forecast for the full business  year to $708 million from a May forecast of $866 million.  </P> <P> That compares to a profit of $677 million in 1989-90.  </P></p>

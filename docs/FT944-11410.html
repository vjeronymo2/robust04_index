			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Anti-EU campaigners surge forward in the polls Opinion polls showing anti-European Union campaigners leading or gaining ground ahead of next Sunday's referendum on EU membership have alarmed Swedish leaders, prompting Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the prime minister, to warn yesterday of threats to the country's cherished welfare system if there is a No vote, Hugh Carnegy writes from Stockholm. The Social Democratic prime minister said rejection of EU membership would lead to a jump in interest rates. This would require tougher government measures to control the public finances. The future of the welfare state has become a central issue in the referendum campaign. The No side, driven mainly by dissident Social Democrats, left-wingers and the Environment party, argues that joining the EU will narrow Sweden's freedom to pursue its famously generous system of universal cradle-to-grave welfare benefits, based on high taxes. Along with claims that EU membership will undermine Sweden's independence and compromise its military neutrality, the No campaign appears to be holding its own against the combined forces of the Social Democratic leadership, the main opposition parties, industry, the trade unions and the main farmers organisation, which all call for a Yes vote. Although one poll last Friday showed the Yes side increasing in strength to lead by 48 to 42 per cent, three other polls showed the No campaign gaining sharply. The Swedish vote follows the 56.9-43.1 per cent victory for the Yes side in neighbouring Finland's EU referendum on October 16. In Norway, which will vote on November 28, polls continue to show a solid lead for the No camp. But they show that if Sweden votes Yes, the gap will narrow sharply. The latest poll at the weekend showed the No lead in such circumstances falling to 41-38. Meanwhile, in Finland yesterday, an unprecedented parliamentary filibuster mounted by EU opponents succeeded in its aim of postponing ratification of Finnish membership until after the Swedish referendum. The Speaker will propose today that the third and final reading of the EU bill start on November 14.</p>

			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: AGE GETS HER DOWN, SO SHE'S BUYING A STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN  </P> <P> When I told my husband I wanted to join a physical fitness club, he put his  paper down. "What for?" he asked. "You stored the stationary bicycle in the  garage, slipcovered the treadmill and made a planter out of the rowing  exerciser."  </P> <P> "The club has a stair-climbing machine," I said.  </P> <P> He took off his glasses. "We moved out of a perfectly good house 10 years ago  because you hated living in a two-story house with all those stairs."  </P> <P> "That was different."  </P> <P> "Your exact words were, 'If God had wanted me to ascend to the second floor, he  would have awarded me frequent flier points.' "  </P> <P> "Don't you ever forget anything?"  </P> <P> "Remember how you used to stack laundry at the bottom of the stairs and make  one trip a year?"  </P> <P> "Are you finished?"  </P> <P> "There were diapers in that pile the day the last kid graduated from high  school."  </P> <P> I should never have brought it up for discussion. I knew he wouldn't  understand. I was young then. When you're young, you never think there's going  to be a day when your derriere makes flapping noises on the backs of your knees  when you walk.  </P> <P> That's because men are built differently than women. They're flat. Men can  sleep on their stomachs and the bed will still look as if it's made. They don't  appreciate that any woman over 40 needs a stair climber to firm up muscles.  </P> <P> "Forget the benefits of muscle toning," I said. "A stair climber would  accelerate my heart rate."  </P> <P> He said, "Why don't you just look at our American Express bill from Christmas?  I know you. You won't stick with it. You have the interest span of a  2-year-old."  </P> <P> "Why would you say a thing like that?"  </P> <P> "Remember our trip to the Statue of Liberty? You climbed halfway up and wanted  me to call you a cab. And what about our trip to Ireland to kiss the Blarney  Stone? You took one look at all those steps and said, 'When you're married 30  years, who needs to kiss another stone?' "  </P> <P> He relented. I knew he would. I had him drop me off at the mall to buy a cute  little stair-climbing outfit with matching headband. He parked a mile away, on  purpose. He knows I hate curbs!  </P></p>

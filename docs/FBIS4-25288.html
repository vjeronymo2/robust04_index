			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 8 (XINHUA) -- The United States is  determined to take further steps to restore democracy in Haiti,  a special adviser to the U.S. President on Haiti said here today.    "Further steps will be taken in the coming days and weeks,"  said William Gray at a hearing of the House Committee on Foreign  Affairs.    "No options have been excluded. Democracy in Haiti will  prevail," Gray said, "neither we nor the Haitian people can long  wait for this event."    He stressed that the U.S. interest requires the restoration  of the democratic process in Haiti and the return of the  duly-elected Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.    Asked if a military intervention in Haiti is imminent, Gray  said that "it is not imminent, at this time, that any is being  planned other than those diplomatic actions which have been  stated." [sentence as received]    "Our policy right now is to continue to press with the  international community on the sanctions" against Haiti, Gray  added.</p>

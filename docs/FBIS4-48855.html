			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Mohamed Farah Aidid, the chairman of the Somali  National Alliance leadership council and of the United Somali  Congress, USC, has met a UN delegation led by UN envoy Iqbal  Riza. Mr. Aidid expressed his happiness with the delegation's  visit and the meeting. He briefed members of the delegation on  the overall situation in the country, saying that, peacewise,  the country was fine. He explained that, since March, no  interclan or intergroup fighting had taken place, though  incidents of banditry had occurred here and there. Mr. Aidid  said the United Nations Operation in Somalia had not delivered  required goods, and said that it had only assisted a limited  number of people.    On the formation of a police force, the chairman suggested  it  was important to speed up the creation of the police force, so  that security was maintained throughout the country. Mr. Aidid  said that progress had been made to reconcile Somali  organizations during a number of conferences that had been held,  the last one being in Nairobi in March, during which a peace  declaration had been signed.    Mr. Aidid told the UN envoy that reparations should be paid  for the damages caused by the five months of war, in which  13,000 people were killed and 45,000 injured, and a lot of  property destroyed. He said the injured and orphans should be  cared for and rehabilitated. Mr. Aidid appealed to the  international community to continue their humanitarian  assistance to support the Somali people. He made it clear that  foreign interference in Somalia was detrimental to the  establishment of peace in the country, adding that Somalia  should be left alone. Finally, Aidid commended UN Special  Ambassador to Somalia Lansana Kouyate for his tireless efforts  to bring about an end to Somalia's problems.    For his part, Iqbal Riza said efforts had been made to  resolve Somalia's problems. He thanked the chairman for the  warm welcome accorded to him and his delegation. [passage  omitted]</p>

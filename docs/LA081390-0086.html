			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SURFING SALT CREEK BEACH PRO/AM;  </P> <P> ARCHBOLD TURNS LIFE AROUND, WINS TITLE  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Matt Archbold's lifestyle was as radical and unpredictable  as the waves he surfed each day.  </P> <P> Speeding through life's fast lane, Archbold landed in a San Clemente jail last  spring and later in a rehabilitation clinic to fight a drug and alcohol habit.  </P> <P> Only 21, Archbold's surfing career appeared to be over.  </P> <P> But less than five months later, his recovery has come full circle. He edged  friend and fellow San Clemente surfer Dino Andino to win the Laguna Sportswear  pro-am competition Sunday at Salt Creek Beach.  </P> <P> Archbold earned $7,400 for the victory; Andino earned $3,400 and took over  first place in the point standings with his finish. Ted Robinson of Manhattan  Beach, who was third, won $2,500 and fourth-place finisher Vince De La Pena  earned $2,200.  </P> <P> "It seems like everything is going right for me," Archbold said. "I want to  keep it up and not let myself down."  </P> <P> Archbold knows all about letdowns. He just wasn't ready to deal with them.  </P> <P> But in April, when Archbold was arrested for driving under the influence, he  realized his life was being wiped out.  </P> <P> While sitting in an eight-foot by 10-foot cell, Archbold did a lot of thinking.  He thought about his family, the friends he lost and the surfing contests he  couldn't compete in because he was hungover. He thought about his dependency on  alcohol and cocaine, and how it cost him his major sponsorship on the pro tour.  </P> <P> "I took a long look at myself and decided I didn't like myself," Archbold said.  </P> <P> So Archbold checked into the Betty Ford Clinic. He learned to deal with his  problems, and his dependency.  </P> <P> He checked out of the clinic early in the summer and rejoined the Professional  Surfing Assn. of America tour. He finished seventh in his first event back, at  Oceanside in June. Then he reached the finals at San Clemente in July, where he  placed fourth.  </P> <P> Then came the victory at Salt Creek.  </P> <P> "I'm thankful that I pulled through everything," Archbold said. "My family and  my girlfriend have been behind me."  </P> <P> Archbold appears to have his problems behind him. At least that's what Andino  says.  </P> <P> "I'm stoked for him," Andino said. "He's different now in every way, mentally,  physically. He was more to himself before. We drifted apart as friends. But now  he's much more open with everyone."  </P> <P> And especially with himself.  </P> <P> Although he finished second for the second consecutive event, Andino didn't go  home disappointed. Andino passed Charlie Kuhn of Indian Harbor, Fla., for the  lead in the point standings and has a 297-point lead over Kuhn, who was  eliminated in the quarterfinals Sunday.  </P> <P> The points title has eluded Andino the last two seasons, with him placing  second to Mike Lambresi of Oceanside both times. With only four events on the  11-stop tour remaining this year, Andino hopes he has the championship in his  grasp.  </P> <P> "It feels good to be in the lead," Andino said, "but it ain't by much. I've got  my focus back and my head's on right (after a slow start this season)."  </P> <P> Mike Stewart, a native of Anaheim now living in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, won his  third title this season in the bodyboarding division, holding off Harry  Antipala of Kalaheo, Hawaii, in the finals.  </P> <P> Stewart, a three-time U.S. champion, extended his lead over Hawaii's Ben  Severson to 598 points in the overall standings.  </P> <P> "The race is still close," Stewart said. "The last contest at San Clemente, I  thought I did well but I got beat by Ben."  </P> <P> After struggling with small one- and two-foot waves all through the event, the  competitors enjoyed three- and five-foot waves for Sunday's finals.  </P> <P> "I had talked to (surf forecaster) Sean Collins on Saturday and he told me  there was a swell coming up," Stewart said. "It helped to know what was going  to happen in advance. I always want to catch the best waves I can, so I knew I  could wait for the better ones today."  </P> <P> Surfing notes  </P> <P> Besides earning $7,400 in prize money, Matt Archbold won an additional $200 for  riding the top wave of the finals. . . . By finishing second in her  bodyboarding quarterfinal heat, Stephanie Pettersen of Haleiwa, Hawaii, became  the first woman to advance to the semifinals of an event on the Professional  Surfing Assn. of America tour. Pettersen finished third in her semifinal and  failed to reach the finals. . . . The next stop on the PSAA tour starts  Wednesday in Malibu.  </P> <P> Results  </P> <P> Surfing  </P> <P> FINAL -- 1.

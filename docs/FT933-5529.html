			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Vodafone falls Renewed worries about profit margins and pricing, and the competitive onslaught from rivals Mercury and Cellnet, were only some of the reasons behind the latest steep fall in Vodafone yesterday. The shares, which have risen virtually in a straight line from 434p in July to a record 585p only last week, dropped 23 1/2 to 547 1/2 p yesterday, having touched 544p at one stage, for a two-day loss of 31 1/2 p. Turnover was a strong 9.6m shares. Telecoms specialists said the latest tumble in the shares came as SG Warburg shifted its stance on the stock to hold, triggering a flurry of US selling. US investors have been the main buyers of Vodafone stock this year, boosting their holding from well below the 20 per cent mark to well above 25 per cent. 'With the US buying drying up, and with UK institutions sellers for the last six weeks or so, the shares were bound to fall,' said one dealer. There was also plenty of downward pressure on the share price following some aggressive activity in the traded options market, where Vodafone was the fifth most active stock option with 919 contracts traded. One of the big US houses was said to have been a big buyer of put options. Active buying ahead of today's interim figures boosted aero-engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce. The shares added 6 at 163 1/2 p on good volume of 5.2m. There were vague whispers late in the session that today's results may be accompanied by a rights issue. NatWest Securities predicts profits of Pounds 35m, against Pounds 20m a year earlier, and expects the company to rebase the dividend, paying 1.95p at the interim stage and 3.55p at the finals to make a total of 5.5p. Provident Financial was up 9 at 452p, after 460p, following the almost doubled profits and sharply increased dividend. HSBC suffered a belated reaction to the interim results, with a number of bank analysts shaving their profits forecasts. NatWest Securities, telling clients to reduce weightings, lowered their 1993 forecast from Pounds 2.44bn to Pounds 2.325bn and that for 1994 from Pounds 2.77bn to Pounds 2.55bn. Lehman Brothers reduced its 1994 estimate from Pounds 2.55bn to Pounds 2.5bn and said Standard Chartered 'looks better value'. HSBC dipped 7 1/2 to 726 1/2 p while Standard Chartered rose 8 to 938p. Schroders, reporting interims tomorrow, was the pick of a generally firm merchant banking sector, the ordinary shares settling 47 up at 1315p and the non-voting stock 70 higher at 1283p. Composite insurances were broadly lower with the exception of Sun Alliance, which improved 2 to 387p on talk of good news accompanying the interim figures this morning. Sun Alliance shares have been weakened in recent weeks by suggestions that the group may be seeking to raise capital via a rights issue. Poor results from Invergordon, the whisky distiller, saw the shares drift back, although hopes of the long awaited return of Whyte &amp; McKay as a predator kept the fall to a minimum. The US drinks group has a 41 per cent stake in Invergordon following a failed bid two years ago. 'Today's results will do nothing to put off Whyte,' said one analyst, adding that the US group will probably wait in the hope that the Invergordon price will fall back before mounting a fresh attack. The shares retreated 9 to 286p. Whitbread was at the centre of good two-way action as Smith New Court and UBS were both said to have downgraded the drink and retail group. Kleinwort Benson had issued a strong buy recommendation on Tuesday. Yesterday, the 'A' shares dropped but later rallied to close just 2 off at 542p. Among leisure stocks, Rank Organisation announced that it had sold off more of its hotels, analysts putting a figure of Pounds 27m on the deal, or around Pounds 50,000 a room. The shares steadied on the news, closing a net 11 off at 785p. Owners Abroad appointed a new chairman to succeed Mr Howard Klein, who resigned after the recent profits warning. The shares rose 3 to 87p. Textile group Courtaulds recovered from a 17p fall to close 5 down at 559p. The company was upbeat about trading prospects, and was behind a 6 1/2 rise in Marks and Spencer to 383 1/2 p, according to dealers. Renewed talk of a price war in the food retail sector was said to be responsible for the poor performance of the leading stocks yesterday. Argyll Group lost 9 to 332p, Kwik Save 6 to 741p, J. Sainsbury 6 to 507p and Tesco 7 to 230p. Asda was helped by a buy recommendation and upgrade from NatWest Securities, the broker believing that improving trading will be reflected in better figures. It is forecasting Pounds 199m for the current year, up Pounds 13m from its previous estimate, and Pounds 216m, up Pounds 9m, for 1994. The shares shaded just a quarter to 65 3/4 p. Worries of further rationalisation in the bakery industry, together with a broker sell recommendation, was said to have undone Associated British Foods, off 7 at 511p. Strong US buying was said to be behind the rise in both Glaxo, up 20 at 614p, and Zeneca, ahead 13 at 727p. SmithKline Beecham was under pressure from a profits downgrade in London, said by dealers to be from NatWest, and the shares lost 7 to 437p. Suggestions that cuts in UK defence spending may halt plans for the mid-life update of the Tornado aircraft returned to the market, weakening British Aerospace, which is due to carry out the programme. The shares gave up 10 to 436p. Higher interim profits helped Senior Engineering harden 3 to 119 1/2 p. Half-time losses of Pounds 52.6m at Simon Engineering and passing of the dividend left the shares down 15 at 58p. Other statistics, Page 25</p>

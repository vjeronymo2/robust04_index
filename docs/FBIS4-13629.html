			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "In Message From Yemeni Foreign </F> Ministry to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Sanaa Denies Bias Against  Socialist Party Diplomats"]    [Excerpt] London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Yemeni Foreign  Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah has denied a reshuffle of  staff -- in particular southern Yemeni diplomats and those who  have close links with the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP].    He expressed his regret that "some people should exploit the  crisis Yemen is experiencing to distort facts and level false  accusations at others."    In a statement AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT received from a Yemeni  Foreign Ministry official, Basindwah said that "with regard to  the ministry's delay in sending financial allowances to the  embassies, this delay is not limited to certain embassies. It  affects all embassies."    This came as a reply to accusations made by some Yemeni  sources regarding a diplomatic reshuffle aimed at recalling to  Yemen YSP diplomats or those close to the YSP, and the Foreign  Ministry's deliberate delay in sending financial allowances to  the embassies where they work.    The foreign minister attributed the delay in sending these  allowances to "the Central Bank's inability to secure the sums  decided in hard currency on the specified dates." [passage  omitted]</p>

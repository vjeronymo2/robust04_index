			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / International Company News: Electrolux declines to SKr758m ELECTROLUX of Sweden, one of the world's largest white goods manufacturers, yesterday reported a decline in its first-half profit after financial items to SKr758m (Dollars 143.76m). This contrasts with a SKr917m profit for the same period of last year but exceeds the forecast level. The company explained that the 1991 profit figure for the first half included SKr184m worth of capital gains from divestments and if adjust-ment was made for that non-recurring item its profit for the first half of this year actually rose by 3 per cent. The company's profit after financial items for the second quarter of the year was SKr505m, virtually unchanged from the figure for the April-June period of 1991. Sales rose by 1 per cent after adjustments for acquisitions and divestments in the first half to SKr40.8bn while in the second quarter sales were down slightly to SKr21.34bn from SKr21.52bn for the same period of last year. Earnings per share after tax were SKr3.50 in the first half compared with SKr6.70 for the same period of 1991 while the rate of return on equity after full tax was 3 per cent compared with 6 per cent for the January-June period of last year. Commenting on the market position, Mr Leif Johanson, Electrolux chief executive, said that uncertainties had increased in recent months over what market trends might be for the second half of the year. While demand in Europe had grown gradually weaker, mainly in the Nordic region, the US recovery would 'probably continue to be slower and weaker than anticipated'. He emphasised that despite relatively low profitability and weak markets, Electrolux would press on with the development of new environmentally friendly consumer products as well as strengthen the com-pany's brand name products globally. The household appliance division enjoyed a sales increase to SKr22.97bn in the first half of the year from SKr22.69bn with half the rise coming from a sales increase by Lehel, the Hungarian white goods company. In the Nordic region and Britain there was a drop in sales volume for white goods while in North America volume sales increased. There was a modest rise in sales of commercial appliances to SKr4.39bn in the period from SKr4.37bn for the same period of 1991 but operating income and profitability were 'considerably lower' than for the first six months of last year. Operating income for industrial products stayed unchanged while sales fell to SKr7.29bn from SKr7.45bn in that sector due mainly to lower invoicing and divestment of operations within its Granges business activities. By contrast the company reported an improved operating profit in its outdoor products range with a slight increase in its sales to SKr5.76bn in the first six months from SKr5.58bn</p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEGAL VIEW: NEGLIGENCE IS EMOTIONAL ISSUE IN COURT  </P> <P> It is every parent's worst nightmare. A son or daughter is playing outside near  the street. Suddenly, you hear a screech of tires, a crash. A speeding car has  jumped the curb and hit your child. You rush outside and find him unconscious,  bleeding. You take him to the hospital, but even when he recovers, you never  forget the moment. The trauma haunts you, leaving you nervous, emotionally  upset, in need of intensive therapy.  </P> <P> This hypothetical scenario is not only a nightmare for parents, it has plagued  judges and lawyers for decades as they have tried to determine the legal  liability of a negligent driver who causes an auto accident. Should that person  be made to compensate the parent or other relatives and friends for the  emotional distress arising from the accident?  </P> <P> In 1968, the California Supreme Court decided a landmark case, Dillon vs. Legg,  in which it ruled that a mother who witnessed the death of her child in an auto  accident may recover from the negligent driver for her emotional distress, even  though the mother was not in any danger at the time of the accident.  </P> <P> Before that case, California refused to award damages for emotional distress or  shock resulting from danger or injury to another.  </P> <P> In creating the new law, the court focused its analysis on the "foreseeability"  of the emotional injury. The court said it was foreseeable that a mother who  was standing next to her son when he was struck by a negligently driven car  would suffer emotional injuries, and that the driver, therefore, had a legal  duty to the mother.  </P> <P> Of course, emotional distress is foreseeable in countless instances in which a  third party is negligently injured.  </P> <P> For example, a friend or an acquaintance may be traumatized after witnessing an  accident. And parents will suffer emotional distress from a child's injury even  if they did not witness the accident, whether they arrived on the scene a few  moments later or simply heard about it by phone.  </P> <P> There had to be limits on the possible recovery, so the Dillon court said  judges should decide, on a case-by-case basis, what was reasonably foreseeable.  </P> <P> In the Dillon case, the mother actually saw the accident happen and also  suffered physical damage as a result of her emotional distress. The court noted  that these were significant factors in finding a legal duty. Later court  decisions expanded liability to cases in which the plaintiff was not present at  the moment of impact and did not suffer physical symptoms of the emotional  distress.  </P> <P> An example of the broadened liability involved a mother searching for her  3-year-old son. She heard someone scream his name and realized that the child  had fallen into a neighbor's pool. When she arrived on the scene, he was  already being given cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Even though she was not  present at the time of the accident, the court allowed her to sue the neighbor  for negligent infliction of emotional distress, the legal name of this type of  lawsuit.  </P> <P> The law was clarified last April when the California Supreme Court -- in a case  called Thing vs. La Chusa -- severely limited the types of cases in which  recovery would be allowed.  </P> <P> In simple terms, and without explaining some of the legal technicalities, in  order to win damages, the court said, a plaintiff must be closely related to  the injury victim, be present at the scene and aware of the injury at the time  it occurs, and suffer serious emotional distress beyond what a disinterested  witness might suffer, and which is not an abnormal response.  </P> <P> What this means for future cases is still open to interpretation.  </P> <P> The court opted for a "bright line" legal rule to lessen uncertainty and moved  away from the somewhat vague legal test of "reasonably foreseeable." At the  same time, however, as the dissenting opinion noted, "it will deny recovery to  victims whose injuries from the negligent acts of others are very real."  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CAREER PROSECUTOR BRANIFF SWORN IN AS U.S. ATTORNEY  </P> <P> William Braniff, a career federal prosecutor with a strong record in military  procurement fraud cases, was sworn in Tuesday as U.S. attorney for San Diego  and Imperial counties.  </P> <P> Braniff, 48, is now the district's chief federal prosecutor and is responsible  for representing the United States in civil and criminal proceedings in state  and federal district courts. His territory is officially called the Southern  District of California.  </P> <P> "I'm really quite proud," Braniff said. "I'm excited about the position. It's  always been sort of the pinnacle. Now, to reach that position is indeed quite  rewarding. I've come to appreciate the job even more now that I've been  appointed."  </P> <P> Braniff has worked for almost a year as interim U.S. attorney and succeeds  Peter Nunez, who stepped down last August to join a law firm. Braniff was  confirmed by the U.S. Senate on July 31 and appointed by President Bush on Aug.  1.  </P> <P> Sen. Pete Wilson, a Republican, nominated Braniff for the position in 1988  because of Braniff's experience in prosecuting drug traffickers and those  involved with military procurement fraud. Braniff's selection as a permanent  replacement for Nunez had been dependent on the outcome of the presidential  election last November, insiders said at the time.  </P> <P> Braniff transferred to the San Diego U.S. attorney's office in 1980 from  Newark, N.J., where he was chief of the criminal division. He was sworn in as  an assistant U.S. attorney for the Newark office in 1970.  </P> <P> Braniff, born in New York and raised in New Jersey, is a paraplegic as a result  of a 1960 auto accident. He was graduated from Rutgers University Law School in  1969 after completing his undergraduate work at Seton Hall University in 1966.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL OF RIGHTS A PRODUCT OF POLITICS, NOT PRINCIPLE;  </P> <P> DOCUMENT, MARKING 200TH YEAR, WAS DESIGNED TO END OPPOSITION TO FEDERALISM  </P> <P> On this day 200 years ago, the House of Representatives finished writing what  may be the most memorable and vital phrases of the U.S. Constitution.  </P> <P> In a dozen amendments -- 10 of which finally were ratified by the states -- the  members of the first Congress spelled out a Bill of Rights that specifically  limited the government's power over its citizens.  </P> <P> Americans were guaranteed the right to speak out without fear of the state.  They could worship as they pleased. Their homes and possessions would not be  subject to unwarranted "searches and seizures" by federal agents. Today, the  Bill of Rights is seen by many as this nation's most significant contribution  to government.  </P> <P> However, this year's debate over whether to trim back one of those rights to  prohibit the desecration of the U.S. flag has illustrated a telling contrast  between how the Bill of Rights is viewed now and how it emerged in 1789.  </P> <P> Critics of the proposed new constitutional amendment, which was spawned by  outrage over a recent Supreme Court decision that made flag burning legal as a  form of free expression, have attacked the measure as a politically inspired  expedient unworthy of a document that symbolizes a triumph of principle over  politics.  </P> <P> "I urge you not to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights . .  . by submitting a proposed amendment which would dilute the protections of the  First Amendment," U.S. District Judge Louis Pollak said at a Senate hearing  last week.  </P> <P> But historians point out that it was political pressure, not a devotion to  philosophical principle, that spurred the first Congress to establish the Bill  of Rights.  </P> <P> "The history of the framing and the ratification of the Bill of Rights  indicates slight passion on the part of anyone to enshrine personal liberties  in the fundamental law of the land," Leonard W. Levy of the Claremont Graduate  School, the foremost historian of the Bill of Rights, has written. "Our  precious Bill of Rights, at least in its immediate background, resulted from  the reluctant necessity of certain Federalists (supporters of the new federal  government) to capitalize on a cause that had been originated, in vain, by the  anti-federalists for ulterior purposes."  </P> <P> As Congress this fall weighs President Bush's proposed amendment, along with a  Democratic alternative for a narrower anti-flag burning law, the original  struggle over the Bill of Rights reflects the blend of motives, political  maneuvers and ideals that underlay the birth of the Constitution and have  influenced its evolution since then.  </P> <P> As broad statements of principle, the first 10 amendments reflected the  strongly held views of Americans regardless of their political stripe. The  notion of citizens' having "certain inalienable rights" that government could  not suppress had been first put forth in the Declaration of Independence more  than a decade earlier, and the Bill of Rights wrote that notion into law.  </P> <P> Still, historians note, it took political attacks by the Constitution's critics  to make the Bill of Rights a reality.  </P> <P> Two years earlier, when the new plan for a federal government was being drafted  in Philadelphia, the framers of the Constitution, including James Madison of  Virginia, had opposed a specific listing of individual rights in the  Constitution.  </P> <P> They contended that such a listing was unnecessary because the new government  was to have quite limited powers. Because the government had no authority to  limit freedom of religion or the press, Madison reasoned, why mention the  subjects at all and risk getting bogged down in peripheral issues?  </P> <P> In September, 1787, the members of the Constitutional Convention voted down a  proposed Bill of Rights before approving the final document.  </P> <P> But the so-called anti-federalists, who were staunch advocates of investing  primary powers in the individual states, rallied opposition to the new  Constitution by raising the specter of tyrannical central government with  unlimited power to oppress the people.  </P> <P> The lack of a Bill of Rights in the new Constitution nearly caused its defeat.  Even in Virginia, the home state of Madison and George Washington, the  Constitution was approved by only 10 votes in the state ratifying convention.  </P> <P> Thomas Jefferson, who was then in Paris as America's ambassador, also thought  the Constitution was vulnerable without a Bill of Rights. In a series of  letters to his friend Madison, he sought to change his mind.  </P> <P> "A Bill of Rights is what the people are entitled to against every government  on earth, general or particular, and what no just government should refuse or  rest on inference," Jefferson wrote in one letter to Madison.  </P> <P> When the first Congress convened in New York in April, 1789, Madison and other  Federalists embraced the Bill of Rights to deflate the prospects of states'  rights advocates.  </P> <P> It is a "nauseous project," Madison confided to a friend during the legislative  struggle, but it "will kill the opposition (to the new central government)  everywhere."  </P> <P> However, his colleagues had other priorities. Then, as now, Congress was beset  by budget deficits, and most members thought that the first order of business  should be organizing the government and seeking new sources of revenue.  </P> <P> But Madison persisted. In July, he was given permission to form a committee to  draw up the amendments. He drew most of the ideas and language from the  constitutions of various states. In mid-August, the amendments were debated on  the House floor. On Aug. 24, 17 amendments were approved and sent to the  Senate.  </P> <P> In a closed session, which was then the norm for the Senate, the upper house  pared down the list to 12 amendments. Finally, on Sept. 25, the two houses  approved the final versions and sent them to the states for ratification.  </P></p>

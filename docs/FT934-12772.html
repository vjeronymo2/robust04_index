			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / International Company News: EDP puzzled over share price rise SHARES in Electronic Data Processing, the Sheffield-based computer software and services group, rose 15 per cent last week from 560p to 648p, puzzling the group and its brokers, Henry Cooke Lumsden, who were at a loss to explain the sudden movement. EDP has been a solid but unspectacular performer in recent years. Mr James Warhurst, electronics analyst with Albert E Sharp, said his company had been buying EDP stock aggressively on behalf of institutional clients. The sharp price rise was a consequence of a short market. Mr Warhurst said he believed the prospects for EDP were excellent. Its new product, UniVision, an advanced database management system using object-oriented technology, was set to do well. A contract with NCR, the computer company which is now part of AT&amp;T, was close to being signed, which would yield substantial annual licence fees. In the first half of the year, EDP's pre-tax profits slipped to Pounds 2.34m from Pounds 2.41m on revenues of Pounds 7.35m (Pounds 7.47m). The company has spent heavily in recent years on moving away from low margin hardware distribution towards software and services and has invested some Pounds 2.5m in the UniVision product.</p>

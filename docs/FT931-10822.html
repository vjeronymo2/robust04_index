			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Welfare state to face scrutiny in spending review: Ministers will be able to float radical ideas THE GOVERNMENT'S planned review of public spending priorities will look at all principles of the welfare state - however politically sacred - Whitehall officials said yesterday. Mr Michael Portillo, the Treasury chief secretary, is expected to launch soon, probably next week, the most fundamental re-assessment of spending in areas such as state benefits, health and housing since the early 1980s. Ministers will be able to float radical ideas - such as the proposal gaining attention in Westminster for 'contracting out' unemployment benefit for many workers to private insurance. Conservative manifesto commitments on preserving universal child benefit and the basic state pension could also be re-thought by the next election. Pledges will be honoured until then, however. 'It is an exercise in good house-keeping, asking awkward questions and looking for value for money,' said one Treasury aide. 'The unthinkable can be thought - but that doesn't mean you are going to do anything about it.' Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, last night warned that the Tories were in danger of provoking 'a wave of anger' throughout the country if promises made in 1992 'become the betrayals of 1993'. Mr Portillo will hope that the announcement will help restore the confidence of financial markets in government economic policy. Public sector borrowing is widely forecast to reach Pounds 50bn in the next financial year and rise even higher in subsequent years, severely curbing the scope for tax cuts and perhaps forcing tax increases. Eventually the review, expected to last the life of the current parliament, will cover all Whitehall departments but Mr Portillo will focus initially on the biggest spenders in a series of bilateral meetings with ministerial colleagues. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, has said he is prepared to listen to all ideas - although his department is at present preoccupied with legislation to equalise male and female retirement ages and on pension regulation. The social security budget has grown by a quarter in real terms over the past eight years. Contributory benefits, such as unemployment benefit, are likely areas for study, along with fast-growing or expensive benefits such as disability payments and child benefit. Unlike the last review under Sir Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe, the former chancellor, after the 1979 general election, there will be no target in terms of expenditure cuts but the aim will be to keep downward pressure on public spending. The Treasury believes many areas of government spending have been largely ignored over the past decade. Last year Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, ended the system of negotiating public spending bilaterally with departments in favour of a system in which a 'control total' is agreed by cabinet in advance - and then spending plans trimmed to fit. The review is a logical development of that process, the Treasury believes. Since the Conservatives came to power in 1979, health spending in real terms has risen 56 per cent, transport spending by 28 per cent, law and order by 96 per cent and education by 25.5 per cent. Spending on housing has fallen in real terms but, at Pounds 6bn, is still one of the larger budgets. Tec contracts aim to cut training time, Page 4 Tory party sheds staff to curb debt, Page 5</p>

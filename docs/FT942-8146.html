			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: UK interest on US earnings My wife and I are considering returning to the UK this year. I am a British subject and she is a US citizen who also holds an Irish passport. We are planning to live on the interest from money inherited by my wife until suitable employment is found. We know we will be liable for US income taxes on the earned interest but would we have any tax liability in the UK? As we intend selling our residence in the US in order to buy property in Britain, would there be any liability for capital gains tax in the UK on the money realised from the sale? The answer to your first question is yes, subject to credit for the US tax. The answer to your second question is no, assuming that you are talking about a home which has been the sole or main residence of both of you since it was bought (or since the end of March 1982, if later). On the other hand, you might have to pay capital gains tax on money withdrawn from your US dollar bank account/s if the rate of exchange has moved against the pound between deposit and withdrawal of each item. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

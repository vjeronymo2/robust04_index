			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News: Hafslund posts record profits of NKr1.5bn HAFSLUND NYCOMED, the Norwegian group best known for its radiology products, began Norway's corporate reporting season yesterday by posting record profits. Group profit, before extraordinary items and taxes, last year advanced 22 per cent to NKr1.5bn (Dollars 214m) from NKr1.28bn in 1991. The dividend is being lifted to NKr2.20 a share from NKr1.60, Hafslund said. The A-shares, nevertheless, closed down NKr4.50 to NKr138.50 in Oslo yesterday. Hafslund was forced to take a NKr80m charge against last year's accounts relating to the sale of its metal operations in 1990 to the Ila Lilleby Group. After the charge, pre-tax profits were, nevertheless, up at NKr1.42bn from NKr1.28bn in 1991. The group expects to pay taxes of NKr417m for 1992 compared with NKr468m in 1991. Group sales and royalties last year rose slightly to NKr1.59bn from NKr1.53bn a year earlier, while research and development expenses increased by NKr35m to NKr652m. Last year, group operating profit increased by NKr100m to NKr1.65bn while operating expenses rose 9 per cent to NKr3.03bn. Mr Svein Aaser, Hafslund's chief executive, said 1992 had been an unusually active year in which several acquisitions were made, while approval for several products was given or sought in several countries. Hafslund also became listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Mr Aaser refused to give a forecast for the group for 1993, but said Hafslund's increased dividend payment suggested how the board saw future development within the company. Two of Hafslund's three divisions reported increased sales and operating profits in 1992, while the energy division saw advances restricted by a 'severe' fall in electricity prices on a spot contract basis.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd by </F> Jacques Duplouich; place and date not given: "Hurd: `A Good  Concept, But Difficult To Translate Into Procedure'"]    [Excerpt] [Duplouich] Security and stability in Europe  have been on the agenda in Paris since yesterday. Can they  reasonably form the subject of a pact?    [Hurd] First, I would like to stress that the initiative  taken by Mr. Balladur is positive. Of course, it is appropriate  to examine all aspects of it. However, it must not lead to the  creation of a new world machinery. There are already enough  international meetings as it is. But, if it is possible to  prevent possible antagonism in Central and East Europe through  diplomacy, then it is worth the effort.    [Duplouich] Is this the right way of establishing a new  peaceful order in Europe?    [Hurd] Let us look at things in practice. Look at what is  happening in the Balkans and further east, in Crimea, for  instance. These are dangerous situations which may deteriorate  if no preventive action is taken. And another Bosnia could then  appear. It is therefore reasonable to invite all those primarily  concerned by a potential conflict to solve their differences  before they reach a critical threshold. This is the very  concept of the Pact for Security and Stability, and it is a good  concept. The problem is how to translate it into procedure.    [Duplouich] Russia has finally agreed to sign the  Partnership for Peace unconditionally. What is your view of  this promise?    [Hurd] I warmly welcome the Russian decision. This idea of  a partnership which will create links between Russia and NATO is  really very ingenious.    [Duplouich] But is there not reason to be worried when it  defense minister, General Grachev, publicly states: "The CIS is  Russia!"?    [Hurd] I recently spoke with Gen. Pavel Grachev and I do not  recognize this statement which is attributed to him. No, Russia  accepts the sovereignty of its neighbors. Of course, it has a  special interest in its relations with them, and the  international community recognizes that. But this interest must  be demonstrated in the sphere of international law. Andrey  Kozyrev, my Russian counterpart, accepts, for instance, that the  peacekeeping interventions in the neighboring states must be  organized at the request of the states themselves and not  unilaterally decided by Moscow.  <H5>  No Justification for Europessimism </H5>   [Duplouich] At present Europe is also about the renewal of  the Strasbourg Parliament. This is an election which is being  prepared amid virtually universal indifference. What is the  reason for this apathy?    [Hurd] The European Twelve continue to enjoy a prosperity  and stability which grateful future generations will admire.  The Union is now emerging from the recession. I therefore see  no justification for gloom or pessimism.    [Duplouich] The fact remains that the one feeling which is  shared by the Europeans is disillusionment.    [Hurd] Allow me to qualify that: There is disillusionment  with all those who promise too much in Europe's name! The  lesson is clear: We must beware of promising too much. With  the Maastricht Treaty, we have a good structure. We must now  build its success brick by brick on the three pillars on which  it rests: common foreign and security policy; cooperation on  crime, drugs, and terrorism; implementation of subsidiarity,  respect for strict budgetary discipline; and completion of the  single market. Let us avoid thinking of a new structure before  we have completed the other.    [Duplouich] So, is a pause vital?    [Hurd] One of Europe's weaknesses, when faced with  criticism, has always been to go further, to "do more." What the  Europeans want is not for us to do "more!" It is to do better  what is already being done. [passage omitted]</p>

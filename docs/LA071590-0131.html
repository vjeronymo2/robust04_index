			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PRIME-TIME FLICKS  </P> <P> In the 1988 She's Having a Baby (KCOP Sunday at 6 p.m.), John Hughes, who seems  to be crafting a comic valentine to approaching fatherhood, in a queasy mixed  message, also shows marriage to be an uncontrollable, off-kilter horror. Kevin  Bacon and Elizabeth McGovern star.  </P> <P> A Friendship in Vienna (KNBC Sunday at 7 p.m.) is a notable 1988 TV movie, that  rare pleasure, a family film of maturity and substance centering on the  friendship of two 13-year-old girls-one Jewish (Jenny Lewis), the other  Catholic (Kamie Harper)-that endures the fall of Austria in 1938.  </P> <P> Allan Arkush's 1979 Rock 'n' Roll High School (KTLA Monday at 8 p.m.) is a  rambunctious drive-in movie designed to show off those New Wave rockers the  Ramones and drawing upon the old formula of rock-crazy kids in collision with a  kill-joy principal; trouble is, this picture says it's OK to burn down the  school if you don't get your way.  </P> <P> Even though the 1985 teen-sex comedy Secret Admirer (KCOP Monday at 8 p.m.)  takes more cues from Georges Feydeau than Mad magazine, it loses its sparkle  halfway through. C. Thomas Howell stars.  </P> <P> The 1987 Revenge of the Nerds II: Nerds in Paradise (KTTV Wednesday at 8 p.m.)  plays like a gross parody of the original, a funny and popular 1984 college  comedy.  </P> <P> The Siege of Firebase Gloria (KCOP Wednesday at 8 p.m.), a 1989 release, is a  rare and noteworthy example of the straightforward Vietnam combat action movie.  </P> <P> Mark Lester's Class of 1984 (KTLA Friday at 8 p.m.) is a scary piece of pop  art, envisioning a time when a teacher (Perry King) can be driven to pulling a  gun to make his students pay attention.  </P> <P> David Lynch's Dune, Part 1 (KTLA Saturday at 6 p.m.; Part II next Sunday at 6  p.m.) is a vast, languorous 1984 science-fiction epic from the Frank Herbert  cult classic set on a wasteland planet populated by gigantic worms. Kyle  MacLachlan stars.  </P> <P> Peter Hyams' 2010 (KTLA Saturday at 8 p.m.), the solidly entertaining rather  than mystical sequel to R2001," finds Roy Scheider on a joint Soviet-American  mission to find out what happened to the original "Discovery" flight.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "It Is Dangerous To Push North Korea Too Far"] </F>   [Text] The DPRK has been using various kinds of "nuclear  cards" for over a year. It was believed to have only two or  three cards but actually, it has shown us many different cards  one after another. The international community was thrown into  confusion every time North Korea used a new card. Although  North Korea is running out of cards, those left, such as  "withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)" and  "declaration of nuclear arms possession," threaten security in  the international community. To prevent the DPRK from resorting  to these dangerous cards, the only way left for us is not to  uselessly apply pressure on it but to try to persistently  persuade it.    North Korea's primary object was to draw out compromises  from the United States by using "the nuclear card." Since the  nuclear cards are used to draw attention from the international  community while mystifying the actual condition of nuclear arms  development, the DPRK will eventually fall into  self-contradiction if it uses them too many times. Such a  contradiction became apparent over the issue of experimental  reactor fuel rod inspection.    It is still uncertain whether North Korea, whose mask was  about to be torn off, will insist on wearing it to the end, or  it will finally reveal its face by compromising at the last  moment.    The point at issue is how long can the patience of the  international community last in dealing with this nation. UN  Security Council member nations started consultations on 3 June  and Japan-U.S.-ROK consultations have also begun in Washington.    The United States has so far maintained a comparatively  cautious stance with regards to negotiating with North Korea.  The United States has been maintaining the stance that it will  not fuss about the past and be satisfied if it can apply the  breaks to the DPRK's future nuclear development.    However, the story is different if thorough inspections  cannot be carried out on fuel rods taken from the experimental  reactor. Making a complete change, the United States now thinks  that strong measures, such as economic sanctions, should be  taken against North Korea. The United States' only goal is to  prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons, because even if the  situation on the Korean peninsula or in northeastern Asia  becomes confused, it would not become a direct threat to  security in the United States.    However, the situation will be different for neighboring  nations of North Korea. They will be directly affected. For  example, refugees may flow into these countries. The United  States and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have  played a major role in the negotiations held so far with North  Korea. But depending on future development regarding the North  Korean issue, opinions and efforts of Japan, China, and the ROK,  which are North Korea's neighbors, aimed at settling the issue  will become more important than before.    What draws public attention at this point is China's  position  on persuading North Korea. China, which insists that the issue  should be settled through discussions, must exert its  influential power now.    Meanwhile, Japan should not give up, even if "North Korea  hangs up whenever Japan calls them," but try through various  channels to hold direct talks with the DPRK.    As for the inspection of fuel rods, the IAEA has concluded  that it is now impossible to conduct the inspection. However,  there is still room for discussions to find a way to break the  current deadlock.    Nothing could be better if economic sanctions are avoided.  The United Nations, if it has no choice but to impose sanctions  because of North Korea's stubborn attitude, should do its best  to obtain consensus from its member nations, including China and  Russia. Moreover, sanctions should be imposed in stages and we  must be careful that the international community will not drive  North Korea into a tight corner.</p>

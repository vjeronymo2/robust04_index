Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic is intelligent and  cautious, does not flinch under fire when asked about his  government's many inconsistencies in Bosnia, and does not  believe in any Bosnian fundamentalism. "My spokesman will have  told you that out of the dozens of interviews for which I have  been requested over the past few days your newspaper is the only  one that I am going to receive," he explained before going to  Washington for the final signing of the agreement.    [Villapadierna] Why has Zagreb fought more for Herzegovina  -- part of another country -- than for eastern Slavonia itself,  which remains occupied?    [Granic] The foremost aim of Croatian policy is the real  reintegration of the occupied areas within the Croatian state's  legal and economic framework. When the UN Protection Forces'  mandate ends, President Tudjman will send Butrus-Ghali our plan  for reintegration on the basis of the existing resolutions. We  wish to extend the air exclusion order to the occupied areas of  Croatia and for it also to include an ultimatum in order to  monitor the borders, as the resolutions stipulate. Regarding  what you say about Herzegovina, I will remind you that the plan  for a greater Serbia, against Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina,  produced its strongest reaction precisely in Herzegovina.  Without that reaction, there would not be a single free  territory in Bosnia today.    [Villapadierna] What has changed for you people and the  Muslims to cease killing each other on the Neretva?    [Granic] The conditions for the current agreement (between  Bosnian Croats and Muslims) were being created for a long time  in lengthy secret negotiations which began 14 September, and  Croatia finally deemed the time ripe to accept and fully support  this. Then it was a matter of finding strong international  support, and this was Washington. The talks in Vienna have  ended successfully, and the military agreement has been signed  and will be ratified in Washington Friday, but nothing would  have been possible without the United States.    [Villapadierna] What is the significance of the other  agreement with Belgrade, whose forces are still invading your  country?    [Granic] Croatia also wants a final normalization of  relations, but with acceptance of its territorial integrity.  The rapidity of that normalization will depend on Belgrade's  attitude to the occupied territories and its observance of the  resolutions. Only, communications have been restored and we can  talk, and this represents an impetus to the commission seeking  the 7,500 missing persons.    [Villapadierna] Have you no guarantee of extending sanctions  until reintegration?    [Granic] We will continue to demand this. The total  harmonization of thinking with U.S. ideas is our best guarantee.  Croatia is prepared to speak with Croatia's Serbs within the  framework of what is laid down by the Security Council, to cease  firing immediately, and to establish transport and  communications. Everybody now wishes to support a final peaceful  solution; Churkin was here yesterday. Croatia is at its best  point internationally.    [Villapadierna] Will there be a referendum on the  federation in Bosnia?    [Granic] Everybody is in agreement on the federation except  some people in the Serbian National Party. Regarding the  confederation, our Constitution requires two-thirds of the Sabor  and then a referendum.    [Villapadierna] Can a southern Slav country be like  Switzerland?    [Granic] We have studied many models with the best U.S. and  European legislators, but the main thing is not the cantons but  the political agreement and equal rights for Croats and Muslims.  Economically, Bosnia has been destroyed. It will need special  assistance from the world; there are good signs of this. On the  Islamic side, it is cheaper to help reconstruction than to send  arms; on the European side, it is between 10 and 20 times  cheaper to send back the refugees and help them here. And the  economy is always a good reason.    [Villapadierna] Will the "Srpska republic" be deactivated?    [Granic] We have offered them entry into the confederation  on the same terms. No concessions will be made on human rights.    [Villapadierna] Are the United States and Russia alone able  to restore peace to the Balkans? Has Europe thwarted their  hopes?    [Granic] It is very complex. Europe is very interested in  this region -- the European powers are our neighbors. On my  recent tour I secured considerable agreement on our negotiation  and the resolution of the conflict, but Europe has no  instruments or strong machinery: It cannot stop the Serbian  aggression. The European conglomeration represents wealth, but  also weakness. That is why we have dwelt on U.S. support so  much.    [Villapadierna] Why did the alleged German interests in  Yugoslavia prove so unacceptable for the same Europe which now  accepts the Russian intervention and interests in Serbia?    [Granic] Throughout this period, Germany's stance has been  very positive, especially in the humanitarian sense, and in  promoting dialogue between Croats and Muslims. On the Russian  presence, most of the powers agree on the influence which they  exert over the Serbs. Germany has no influence over the Serbs,  but it does over Russia. In addition, Russia's particular  interest in the Balkans must be accepted.    [Villapadierna] Why did Zagreb betray its alliance with  Sarajevo, only to sign the confederation agreement after  thousands of deaths?    [Granic] Write that I utterly disagree with that, and I have  been following this conflict for a long time. Since the  aggression against Croatia, we have offered them a military  alliance. I am saying this for the first time. The situation  of Bosnia and Herzegovina was very difficult, surrounded on all  sides, but they should have taken their decision earlier.  Croatia supported independence, because the agreement was a  decentralized country with equal rights for everybody. The  (Bosnian) Croats were the best organized to defend their  territory, and the Muslims received their first weapons from  Croatia.    [Villapadierna] The first convoys of weapons to defend  Srebrenica were also stopped by the Croats.    [Granic] What some Croat troops did with the Muslim convoys,  the destruction of Mostar, or the massacres of Achmici and  Stupni Dol, are another matter. I can also give you around 40  instances of the Muslims. On many occasions, it was Croats and  Muslims together who stopped the convoys.    [Villapadierna] People paid by secret services to worsen the  conflict?    [Granic] Clearly. It is strange that many of these crimes  were covered immediately by some television channels such as  CNN, while others which were much bloodier were not mentioned:  There were interests. I assure you that what we are going to  sign is the same thing that Tudjman and I proposed back in  August without much response.    [Villapadierna] President Izetbegovic also offered a  confederation in Geneva.    [Granic] This desire existed on both sides, but I tell you:  I wish to speak to you not of specific mistakes -- that is  history -- but of a global strategy. You know that the Muslims  are not a homogeneous body: The majority are in favor of full  cooperation with the Croats, but others are in favor of a  separate Islamic state.    [Villapadierna] Have you won support for your agreement in  Moscow?    [Granic] Moscow has been very active: The Serbs will join  in the negotiations.</p>

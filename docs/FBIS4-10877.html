			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Television Nacional and Channel 13 have signed an  agreement to jointly transmit programs produced by both channels  through the international station, by means of our signal, which  we have been transmitting since 1988.    Over the past six years the signal of Television Nacional de  Chile has gained a significant audience in Argentina, besides  having an important presence in Bolivia, Ecuador, Paraguay,  Peru, Uruguay, and even the south of Brazil. Making the country  known through the television screen is an important  responsibility. This company thinks it has succeeded.    But in a world where communications play an essential role,  Television Nacional has wanted to take a new step forward. Its  highest authorities, headed by Executive Director Jorge  Navarrete, signed an agreement with the Television Corporation  of the Catholic University of Chile directed by Heliodoro  Rodriguez. With this agreement the two most important channels  of the country will put together their most important programs  for the generation, transmission, and sale of a single and  common international signal, which will be transmitted through  satellite and will be distributed essentially by cable  television, directed to the Spanish-speaking people of the  entire continent.

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Survey of Franchising (2): Expansion routes - Becoming a Franchisor AIDEN O'Kelly, general manager of Hertz car rental business in the UK, has a typically pragmatic view about the benefits of franchising: 'It is clearly one of the most cost-effective ways for financing and managing our expansion in the UK.' While franchising as a means of expansion has had a bad Press in recent months as a result of the problems faced by some retail franchises during the recession, a number of companies such as Hertz still see franchising as an important part of their business expansion plans. It has 40 franchised outlets out of a total of 142 and is seeking to double its turnover from franchising over the next two years. Commercial Union is believed to be poised to launch a new franchised financial services product although details are being kept under wraps at present. Lucas, the automotive spares company, has launched its Autocentre franchise to build on its existing 54 Autocentres around the country. 'Many large companies are actively considering franchise developments, both in the UK and overseas,' points out Mr David Acheson, franchise consultant with Stoy Hayward. UK retailers such as Marks and Spencer and Thorntons are looking at franchising as a way of growing internationally. Some continental and American chains are eyeing the potential for franchising in the British market. I Can't Believe It's Yogurt], a successful US franchise, has just launched in the UK. French companies are particularly keen on the UK market since franchising has proved such a popular growth vehicle in France. It has some 675 franchisors, twice the number in the UK, with a market worth some Pounds 10bn. One of the most successful UK franchisors of recent years has been the Body Shop, the specialist cosmetics chain which emphasises natural products. Yet Sock Shop and Tie Rack, two other niche retailers of recent years who grew by franchising, have found the going much tougher. Tie Rack, for example, has had to terminate the franchises of some franchisees 'who breached their contracts in relation to standards of operation and payment of debt.' The main advantages for companies of expanding through franchising are two-fold. First, it enables a company with a successful operation to expand more quickly than could otherwise be achieved using its own capital. Secondly, the problem of finding highly-motivated branch management is overcome by the expedient of having the 'manager' work for himself as a franchisee. In addition, the routine administrative problems which can bedevil ordinary company-owned chains are reduced by the franchising system. The franchisor, moreover, obtains greater buying muscle through having an expanding number of tied outlets. However, franchising as a means of growth can have its drawbacks. Loss of management control over franchisees can sometimes lead to harming of the national image that the franchisor is seeking to establish. The classic example of this was the Wimpy fast food chain some years ago, when it was forced to buy back many franchised outlets because of slipping standards. Other problems faced by franchisors include the franchisee feeling that success is due more to his own efforts than that of the franchisor; this can lead to the franchisee resenting having to make regular royalty payments. Communications can become a problem, which can lead to conflicting objectives and less willingness by franchisees to co-operate in the running and development of the system. 'Most of these problems arise, however, when the franchisor has not selected his franchisees with sufficient care,' points out Mr Peter Stern, senior franchise management with National Westminster Bank. 'Personality, suitability for the particular franchise, family support and financial background are all important factors to be considered in this very vital area of franchise recruitment, and a franchisor delegates his selection process at his peril.' Many franchisors admit that their early choice of franchisees had been bad. A number were unable to resist the temptation to sign up franchisees simply because the franchise was a new one and the franchisor wanted to get it operating, with the idea of solving potential problems later on. Companies that are considering franchising as a means of expansion need to consider several factors. These include whether there is sufficiently large market demand for a product or service and whether it can easily be franchised. In addition, the franchisor should consider whether or not the product or service has staying power or whether it would just be a passing fad. Would-be franchisors should be clear whether effective and simple controls can be established and wether the company has sufficient depth of management to recruit franchisees and to develop the franchise. If the answers to these questions are positive, then the prospective franchisor should go forward with a pilot operation to test the market formula, prove its viability, highlight problem areas, and perfect the package by experimenting with opening hours, advertising methods, and so on. The minimum period for a pilot run should be from six to nine months and it many cases it would be better to operate several pilot schemes in tandem for 12 months or more. The British Franchise Association makes it clear that the relationship between franchisor and franchisee is crucial. 'The skill of the franchisor in dealing with the franchises throughout the relationship will be a fundamental factor in the degree of success which he will enjoy,' it says.</p>

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Election 1992: Owen moves to save his old friends from the axe DR DAVID OWEN, former leader of the Social Democratic party, is expected tomorrow to endorse Mr John Major, even though he will not vote Conservative. Dr Owen's decision has been influenced by loyalty to Mr John Cartwright and Mrs Rosie Barnes, who are standing again as Social Democrats - they face strong challenges from Labour in the south London seats of Woolwich and Greenwich - and by the campaign itself. Dr Owen has told Mrs Barnes and Mr Cartwright he will vote Liberal Democrat in Bow and Poplar, in east London, where he lives, as a tactical move against the hard-left Labour incumbent Mrs Mildred Gordon, who had a 4,631 majority over a Liberal in 1987. But Dr Owen, who is standing down from his Plymouth Devonport constituency, believes he can square his tactical vote with a personal endorsement of Mr Major. Dr Owen's friends argue that even Liberal Democrats accept that the next prime minister will be either Mr Major or Mr Neil Kinnock. Dr Owen's endorsement of Mr Major, regardless of the strings attached, will be welcomed by the Conservatives. Mr Peter Gummer, chairman of the public relations firm Shandwick, who is advising the prime minister, believes that Dr Owen's endorsement may persuade many 'don't knows' to vote Conservative. Mrs Barnes, defending a 2,141 majority in Greenwich, said: 'Everyone knows Mr Paddy Ashdown is not going to be prime minister. If forced to make a choice (between Mr Kinnock and Mr Major) I would reluctantly come down on the same side.' Mrs Barnes believes she has already squeezed the Labour vote as much as she can in the working class estates of Deptford, where if the posters are anything to go by she is running neck and neck with her Labour opponent, Mr Nick Raynsford. She hopes Dr Owen's endorsement of Mr Major could be to her advantage in Conservative Blackheath, where the former SDP leader is due to canvass over the weekend. But any benefit to her from the soft Tory vote may be offset in Labour wards, where the party is expected to use an Owen endorsement of Mr Major to tar Mrs Barnes as a 'closet Conservative'. In neighbouring Woolwich, which Mr Cartwright held with a 1,937 majority in 1987, the social democrats believe there is less opportunity to target the conservative vote. Thus Mr Cartwright can see few personal benefits in Dr Owen endorsing Mr Major. Mr Cartwright, who says he would have a 'realistic reappraisal' of his position and who is likely to join the Liberal Democrats, sought and received a warn endorsement from Mr Ashdown. He says Labour may 'try and misrepresent' an Owen endorsement for Mr Major as proof that he too is a Conservative, but he remains confident that Mr Ashdown's support and the fact that Dr Owen is voting Liberal Democrat will blunt any attack from Labour.</p>

The regulations will go into  effect on 1 October 1993.    Standing Committee of the Anhui People's Congress 10 July  1993  <H5>  Chapter 1 General Principles </H5>   Article 1 To stabilize and perfect the rural  household responsibility system of linking remuneration to  output, protect the legitimate rights and interests of both  parties to agricultural contracting (abbreviated hereafter as  contracting), maintain the rural economic order, mobilize the  enthusiasm of peasants for production, and promote the  development of a market economy in the countryside, we hereby  formulate these regulations in accordance with the appropriate  provisions in national laws and regulations.    Article 2 These regulations shall be applicable to  the management of contracts in the fields of farming, forestry,  animal husbandry, and fishing entered into by the agricultural  collective economic organizations or villagers' committees  within the jurisdiction of this province, on the one hand, and  contractors, on the other.    Article 3 A contract must be concluded in a way  that complies with the relevant laws and regulations, is  consistent with national policies, abides by the principles of  voluntary participation, mutual benefit, and democratic  consultation, and takes into consideration the interests of all  three parties--the state, the collective, and the individual.    Article 4 Means of production owned by the  collective or owned by the state but used by an agricultural  collective economic organization, including farmland, wooded and  hilly areas, bodies of water, orchards, tea plantations, houses,  and equipment and machinery, shall be contracted out by  agricultural collective economic organizations which both own  them and have the right to use them, or villagers' committees.    Article 5 Members of agricultural collective  economic organizations, villagers, and other legal persons and  citizens can all be parties to a contract. Other things being  equal, a member or villager of the collective economic  organization in question shall enjoy contracting priority.    In case of a large-scale project, the contractor shall  provide guarantees while the contract-issuing party shall  examine the credentials of the contractor before it awards the  contract.    Detailed standards for large-scale projects shall be set by  the township (town) people's government.

Establish and improve a contract management system.    b) Guide the signing of a contract and oversee the  verification of a large-scale contract.    c) Supervise and inspect the execution of large-scale  contracts.    d) Mediate and arbitrate disputes over a contract.    e) Examine the amendment and termination of contracts.  Affirm  contracts null and void.  <H5>  Chapter 2 Signing and Executing a Contract </H5>   Article 7 What projects to be contracted out, the  format of the contract, targets, and contract duration shall be  decided democratically by members of the agricultural collective  economic organization, villagers' assembly, or representative  meeting. When a contract is to be awarded through open bidding,  the relevant targets shall be announced in posters beforehand in  the interest of fair competition.    Article 8 A contract is deemed to have been  established when the two parties reach agreement and sign or  seal it.    When one party to a large-scale contract demands  verification  or notarization, such verification and notification shall be  performed by the local contract management organ and the  notarization body, respectively.    The format of a written contract shall be established  uniformly by the provincial department in charge of rural  economic administration.    Article 9 The contract shall include the following  provisions:    a) Names of the contract-issuing party and contractor.    b) The title of the project, its quantity, quality,  location,  the starting and finishing dates, and the method of production  and operation.    c) The means of production and operation as well as services  that the contract-issuing party shall provide the contractor;  the production capability and technical resources the contractor  shall possess as well as investment, management, and maintenance  targets; d) the amount of taxes, the sum to be retained by the  village, and township (town) comprehensive planning fee, all  payable by the contractor.

Article 12 After a contract is declared null and  void, the properties acquired by one party under the contract  shall be returned to the other party. In case of losses, the  culpable party shall pay damages for such losses. If both  parties are at fault, they shall both be held liable for the  respective losses they have caused.  <H3>  Chapter 3 Rights and Obligations of Both Parties to a  Contract </H3>   Article 13 The rights and obligations of the  contract-issuing party are:    a) Collect from the contractor a sum of money for retention  by the village and the township (town) comprehensive planning  fee in accordance with contract provisions.    b) In the case of a large-scale contract, collect from the  contractor contracting funds and a fixed assets depreciation fee  in accordance with the terms of the contract.    c) Transfer the labor accumulation workers and voluntary  workers that the contract should provide in accordance with the  terms of the contract.    d) Re-issue the contract promptly upon its expiration.    e) Implement and carry through with the goals, policies, and  measures of the state aimed at supporting and ensuring stable  agricultural development, organize the development of the  agricultural infrastructure.    f) Safeguard the contractor's decision-making authority in  production and operations, its right to dispose of its output,  and its right to make a profit, protect the contractor's  legitimate rights and interests.    g) Guide the contractual operations and activities of the  contractor in accordance with the contract and provide services  before, during, and after production.

Article 20 When one party breaks the contract  unilaterally, it shall pay a contract-breaking fee to the other  party. If such a fee falls short of covering the economic losses  suffered by the other party, the party that breaks the contract  shall make an additional payment equal to the shortfall. Should  the other party demand that it continue to honor the contract,  the latter shall do so.    Article 21 When a party cannot carry through with  the contract in part or in whole due to forces beyond its  control, it shall notify the other party in writing promptly.

Article 22 Should the illegal interference by an  organization, unit, or individual prevent the execution of a  contract and cause severe losses, it or he shall be held legally  liable and required to pay economic compensation.

Article 26 When a dispute arises over a contract,  the two parties shall try to resolve it through consultation  promptly. Should consultation fail, any one party may ask the  local contract arbitration committee to arbitrate.    Article 27 After it receives a written application  for mediation or arbitration, the contract arbitration committee  shall reply within 15 days. Before mediation or arbitration, the  contract should continue to be executed.    Where the contract arbitration committee succeeds in  mediating the dispute, it shall prepare a written mediation  agreement. When mediation fails, a case shall go to arbitration  and an adjudication decision made. Both parties to a contract  shall abide by the mediation agreement or adjudication decision.    When a party to a contract refuses to accept the arbitration  decision, it may file an appeal with the local county  (municipal, district) people's court within 15 days after it  receives the adjudication decision. If a party neither abides by  the decision nor files an appeal, the other party may apply to  the people's court for performance of contract.    When a dispute arises over a contract, a party may also file  a lawsuit directly with the local people's court.  <H5>  Chapter 7 Supplementary Articles </H5>   Article 28 Contracts entered into before these  regulations go into effect shall be improved upon by being  brought in line with these regulations.    Article 29 Issues relating to the detailed  implementation of these regulations shall be interpreted by the  provincial agency in charge of rural economic administration.

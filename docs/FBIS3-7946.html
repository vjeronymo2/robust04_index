			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Following a week's break caused by the working  visit of Vladimir Meciar to the countries of Asia, the Slovak  Government met in Bratislava today. Deputy Prime Minister Roman  Kovac and Minister of Foreign Affairs Jozef Moravcik are not  taking part in its 85th regular session. It is, however,  expected that the government will adopt a position today on  personnel questions concerning the posts of minister of foreign  affairs and minister for administration and privatization of  national property of the Slovak Republic. The president of the  Slovak Republic asked Vladimir Meciar for this yesterday.    The president refused to appoint Jozef Prokes minister of  foreign affairs yesterday. The name of Olga Keltosova, minister  of labor, social affairs, and the family, is being mentioned in  this connection, as well as that of Ivan Mjartan, Slovak  ambassador to the Czech Republic. Olga Keltosova, however, has  allegedly denied her candidature. According to our information  from government circles, Eva Mitrova, current head of the  permanent mission of the Slovak Republic at the Council of  Europe in Strasbourg, is a hot candidate for the post of  minister of foreign affairs.    The candidate for the post of minister for administration  and  privatization of national property, according to Vladimir  Meciar, has been known to the coalition government for several  months. As he said recently, he has been waiting to appoint him  only because the position of the government was not stable and  he considered the appointment of a minister in these  circumstances illogical. [passage omitted]    Ondrej Hanko, head of the government office press  department,  has said the following:    [Begin Hanko recording] [passage omitted] In the next part  of  the session, the prime minister reported on the president's  letter, which he had received. In this connection, I would like  to tell you that I have been empowered to deny yesterday's  statement by the spokesman of the president of the Slovak  Republic in which he said that the Slovak prime minister agreed  that the president did not wish to appoint Deputy Prime Minister  Prokes to the post of minister of foreign affairs. The prime  minister never uttered these words at yesterday's talks with the  president. [passage omitted]    The prime minister said that he has decided not to sign the  bill on big privatization that the government passed to the  president. He stated that he will pass it to the National  Council for it to be discussed again. [end recording]    This was from the session of the government. [passage  indistinct]</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Other Pathology of the Eye  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current standard is worded differently for each class of certification but without significant difference of meaning. In accordance with the AMA recommendations, therefore, revision is made to correct the spelling of the plural word ``adnexa'' and to provide for the same standard for all classes of certification, at proposed &sect;&sect;67.103(e), 67.203(e), and 67.303(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Eye Fusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This standard, which applies only to first- and second-class certification, is revised to correct spelling and to eliminate gender-specific pronouns. No substantive revisions are proposed for this standard. (See proposed &sect;&sect;67.103(f) and 67.203(f)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Intraocular Pressure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The AMA Report recommends for all three classes of certification the measurement of intraocular pressure after the age of 40 to identify glaucoma. The basis for this recommendation is that glaucoma may appear in two forms. One, closed-angle glaucoma, is acute, painful, and potentially impairing; the other, open-angle glaucoma, is subtle, painless, and progressive. Either form can be destructive to vision. Since, in many cases, open-angle glaucoma is not noticed by the individual until after permanent changes in visual fields have occurred, a search for it should be a part of any routine health maintenance examination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current regulations have no standard for intraocular pressure, however, and the FAA is not proposing standards at this time. While the recommendations of the AMA Report suggest that everyone might benefit from regular measurement of intraocular pressure, the risk to flight safety appears minimal in comparison to the cost and difficulty of testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current standards for hearing are as follows: (1) for first-class medical certification the person must be able to hear the whispered voice at 20 feet with each ear separately or demonstrate a hearing acuity of at least 50 percent of normal in each ear as shown by a standard audiometer; (2) for second-class certification, the person must be able to hear the whispered voice at 8 feet in each ear separately; and (3) for third-class certification, the person must be able to hear the whispered voice at 3 feet in one ear. The use of the whispered voice has raised questions of accuracy and validity in the aviation environment. Pure tone audiometry is considered a more scientific and accepted method for determining hearing capabilities and for documenting changes in that capability over a period of time. The present procedure, however, has served well in enabling AME's to identify for referral and evaluation those individuals whose hearing acuity is less than normal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Testing accomplished by the AME serves as a screen to identify those individuals who should receive more specialized initial and periodic future evaluations. Almost all hearing-impaired applicants, however, receive special issuance of a certificate after documentation of their condition. Many undergo practical testing to determine their functional aviation capabilities. In the absence of other significant pathologic conditions, the certification decision regarding hearing relates only to the individual's ability to safely exercise airman privileges. Medical flight tests are used frequently for this determination, and the subject may use hearing aids, if necessary. Though an airman may regularly use a hearing aid for activities not involving flight, the normal aircraft communication equipment may serve as well, and the agency does not, in such cases, mandate the wearing of an aid. Special issuance is possible, especially for applicants for third-class medical certification, in the presence of total deafness. Restrictions on the exercise of airman privileges are applied to maintain safety in cases of total or functionally significant deafness, and agency experience demonstrates that these practices have been successful and appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The AMA Report recommends that speech discrimination be the basic screening examination used for certification for all three classes. If sound field or speech testing audiometry equipment is unavailable, pure tone audiometry is offered as an alternative. Speech testing would be accomplished either binaurally or monaurally, while pure tone audiometry would apply a ``better ear'' and ``poorer ear'' standard. The AMA Report suggests individual consideration when an applicant fails the standard tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA agrees with the AMA Report that the standards for hearing and for testing should be the same for all classes of medical certification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, it is unlikely that equipment appropriate for speech discrimination testing, as proposed by the AMA Report, will be available to all AME's. In keeping with the intention of the AMA Report and in the interest of cost, availability, simplicity, and functional adequacy, the FAA believes and, therefore, proposes at &sect;&sect;67.105(a), 67.205(a), and 67.305(a) that the basic screening test administered to all applicants be a spoken voice test. This test is included as part of Hearing Requirement No. 1 and Hearing Requirement No. 2, Chapter 6._ Medical Requirements, Personnel Licensing, International Standards and Recommended Practices, Annex 1 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, ICAO. It has been implemented in many countries and is easily described and administered. The conversational voice test is not inconsistent with the AMA Report emphasis on speech discrimination. The proposed standards would require that a person be able (1) to hear an average conversational voice in a quiet room, using both ears, at a distance of 6 feet; (2) understand speech by audiometric speech discrimination testing to a score of at least 70 percent obtained in one ear or in a sound field environment; or (3) provide acceptable results of pure tone audiometric testing in accordance with a table that is provided in the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Audiometric speech discrimination or pure tone audiometric testing are proposed as alternatives or for the further evaluation of individuals who show reduced hearing acuity in the conversational voice test. The proposed standard would apply to the examination of applicants without use of their hearing aids. Need for these devices to meet the standard suggests that a more detailed evaluation is appropriate before certification, and that special issuance with periodic reevaluation may be necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Ear, Nose, Throat, and Equilibrium  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to hearing (discussed above), current ear, nose, throat, and equilibrium standards specify: no acute or chronic disease of the middle or internal ear; no disease of the mastoid; no unhealed perforation of the eardrum; no disease or malformation that would interfere with or be aggravated by flying; and no disturbance in equilibrium.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

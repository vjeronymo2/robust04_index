			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Musa Zondi and Mapula Sibanda] </F>   [Text] A plan for East Rand residents to pay a levy of  R2.10 [rand] a month for a neighbourhood watch programme by the  controversial Self-Defence Units [SDU] has been proposed by a  member of the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging]  legislature, Mr Obed Bapela. Bapela proposed the plan yesterday  at a meeting attended by more than 200 SDU members. The meeting  was seeking ways and means of reintegrating members of the SDUs  into society.    Also present were MEC [Member of the Executive Committee]  for  Safety and Security Jesse Duarte and Education MEC Mary Metcalf.    Bapela said the levy would fall under a general services  charge to help reinstate "a culture of payment".    The campaign is centred on creating jobs for the unemployed  members of the defence units and to send them back to school  should they so wish.    Speaking yesterday at Katlehong's Las Vegas hall, Metcalf  told members of SDUs on the East Rand that those who had the  responsibility of defending the community should be afforded the  chance to learn. The plan for education rested on two pillars:  what to do with those who wanted to go back to school or those  who thought it unlikely they would go back.    The education plan would comprise four phases:     -  A go-back-to-school programme for those between the ages  of 13 and 18;    -  A programme for the 19-to-25-year-olds willing to go to  school  and to integrate those unwilling to return to school into the  police force or reservists;    -  An illiteracy-combating programme which would also involve  life-skills training; and    -  Psychological and counselling support for those plagued by  many  years of war in the area.        Mr Nazir Carrim of the PWV legislature's education desk said  support had been received from Dr Saths Cooper of the Family  Institute, Lloyd Vogelman of Wits University and other experts.    For those between the ages of 13 and 18, a school  re-orientation programme will begin next month and run until  December with the idea of integrating them into normal schools  at the beginning of next year.    In a frank admission, Duarte said it was true that some SDU  members had been involved in criminal activities. She said the  time for action, and not rhetoric, had come. She also said  police had expressed a willingness to take people into their  reservist force, but communities had to agree on who would be  allowed in. Those who were involved in criminal activities  would be left out.    Duarte also said they had consulted with industry on the  East  Rand about job creation. Most industries had expressed concern  at the high level of violence and it was important for the area  to achieve stability before investment in the area could be  expected.    Housing MEC Mr Dan Mofokeng has identified a development  plan  in Germiston, she said. The project could create employment for  some SDU members.    Duarte also announced that Housing Minister Mr Joe Slovo had  approved PWV premier Mr Tokyo Sexwale's plan to build 150,000  low-cost houses in the next 12 months.</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Usher-Walker agrees Pounds 15m Sun Chemical bid USHER-WALKER, the manufacturer and distributor of printing inks, yesterday announced agreement on terms of a Pounds 14.8m takeover by Sun Chemical, the UK subsidiary of Sun Chemical Corporation, a US manufacturer of graphic arts products. Usher-Walker's board has recommended that shareholders accept Sun's 167 1/2 p per share cash offer, which carries a loan note alternative. The offer is more than double the share price of 81p on Tuesday when the company's market value stood at Pounds 7.1m. Upon the offer becoming unconditional, holders of preference shares would be offered 80p cash for each 3.5 per cent cumulative preference share, valuing the preference share capital at Pounds 80,000. Usher-Walker shares jumped to 165p yesterday, before falling to 161p at the close. Mr Edward Barr, group president and chief executive officer, said both parties, which had enjoyed a good relationship for some time, believed the market had been 'sending the wrong signals' about the fundamental strength of Usher-Walker's business. 'Usher-Walker is a fine well-respected, well-managed business . . . By working together Sun believes it can win a good return on its investment.' New Jersey-based Sun has operations in North and South America as well as in Europe, and is affiliated to Dainippon Ink &amp; Chemicals, the Japanese diversified chemicals group. Usher-Walker's profit faded from Pounds 217,000 to Pounds 9,000 before tax in the half-year to June 30 under pressure from restructuring and redundancy costs, which amounted to Pounds 143,000, as well as tightening margins. Falling newspaper advertising has reduced demand for black newspaper ink, Usher-Walker's main revenue earner. Sun plans to keep Usher-Walker as a separate company, with its management intact. It plans to dispose of Surface Flatness, a printing plates producer bought by Usher-Walker in September last year.</p>

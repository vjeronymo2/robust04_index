			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Good President"] </F>   [Text] Everything could have been so fine. First a  Bundeswehr music corps will solemnly play Ludwig van Beethoven's  "Opferlied" before Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen welcomes the  invited guests.    And then: the speech.    Roman Herzog, the newly elected federal president, wanted to  show the Germans who their new head of state is on 20 July.  With an outstanding speech at the Berlin German Resistance  Memorial, the constitutional law expert was hoping to present  himself as a worthy successor to Richard von Weizsaecker. The  appropriate setting: The central commemorative event for the  Hitler attackers of 20 July 1944.    The ideal first appearance he had dreamt of, the "first  major  test" (Herzog), has become a pitiful false start. Somebody else  will speak instead of Herzog: Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl.  The Christian Democratic Union [CDU] chairman said: "It is the  50th anniversary, and I would like to do it myself this time."  Period. Herzog gave in. He does not want to strain the  commemorative day with a "row over prestige" and so he submitted  to the inevitable. On "second thought," he has realized that he  made a "mistake:" "I had not given it enough thought."    After the unlucky term of the "easygoing" nation he used on  the day he was elected, this has now been his second blunder.  In modest defiance, Herzog said that he had now "decided" to  invite those who participated in the aborted attack against  Hitler, and their descendants, to Bellevue Palace. Can he live  with the impression that he is a president by the grace of Kohl?  "Yes, in the first three weeks of my term I can."    Herzog knows to whom he owes his high office. Now his patron  has made him painfully aware of who has the say in the state:  not he who is the first man in the state according to protocol,  but Kohl himself, the third man.    The chancellor did not even think it necessary to react to  Herzog's intention, which he voiced in public -- he simply let  Herzog run his head into a wall.    "Herzog did not even mention this desire in our office," one  aide from the Chancellor's Office said hypocritically. This is  how the great ruler likes it: Any wishes, and even those of the  future president, have to be reported to him, particularly when  there is an election campaign going on.    Moreover, Kohl seems to be worrying greatly that, through  meaningful speeches on the occasion of historic days, this  federal president might also acquire excessive respect and  become an example to the citizens. Ten years of Richard von  Weizsaecker have taught him enough.    Weizsaecker talked himself into the Germans' hearts on 8 May  1985: In an internationally acclaimed address on the 40th  anniversary of the capitulation, which also meant liberation, in  which Weizsaecker bowed in the Bundestag to all victims of  fascism, expressing his respect to all resistance fighters  without exception. Pressed on vinyl, the speech became a  bestselling record and Weizsaecker became the chancellor's  private enemy. Kohl suffered because he could not come anywhere  near to speaking as eloquently as Weizsaecker.    Kohl was foresighted and took precautions that the future  president would not disturb his parade on 20 July. As early as  October -- when Saxon Steffen Heitmann was still his favorite  candidate -- the chancellor told the organizers who would hold  the speech at the commemorative event at the Bendlerblock on  Stauffenberg Street.    "He indicated that he would like to do it," Dieter Thomas,  member of the board of directors of the 20 July Relief  Foundation, said. Everything was clear to Thomas: "Nobody can  say no if the chancellor wants something."    In February, the 18 members of the preparatory committee for  the commemorative day met in the Senat building in Berlin.  There were representatives of three resistance organizations,  the Federal Government, the memorial in Stauffenbergstrasse, and  of the Senate.    The proposal that Chancellor Kohl should deliver a speech as  he did 10 years ago on the occasion of the 40th anniversary, was  accepted without any discussion. "There were not the slightest  signs of opposition," Volker Kaehne, head of the Senat office,  said.    The chance to adequately face the victims of Nazi terrorism  and their descendants at this anniversary, was forfeited --  because it did not occur to anyone to contradict the chancellor.  Anybody could anticipate that, in the middle of the election  campaign, it would have been more suitable for the federal  president, who is nonpartisan by the very nature of his office,  to head the celebrations on the commemorative day, rather than  the CDU chairman.    This means making 20 July "an incredibly political date,"  Peter Steinbach, head of the Berlin memorial, complained.    After Kohl's solitary decision, the Social Democratic Party  of Germany [SPD] also realized that it had left the chancellor  an excellent opportunity to present himself in a solemn way.  Fully tied up with the search for a profile of its own and a  program, Rudolf Scharping's team missed the importance of the  50th anniversary, the first major historic commemorative day in  united Germany.    Bernd Faulenbach, head of the SPD Executive Committee's  History Commission, admits that "this issue was probably not  given the necessary importance." In March, the SPD Presidium  approved the concept for the celebrations, including the speaker.    Now the SPD chairman has voiced his criticism, in the same  unfortunate way that he did after his party friend, Johannes  Rau, failed to become federal president. Scharping complained  that he would have regarded it as appropriate "if the chairman  of a party that particularly suffered under the dictatorship of  the Third Reich would have been asked to participate in the  central commemorative celebration."    This idea came rather late. Friedrich Bohl (CDU), head of  the Chancellor's Office, assures that, officially, the SPD had  not even asked to be put on the list of speakers.    Now even the Greens have presented the ideal person to speak  at the commemorative celebrations -- an election campaign is an  election campaign. It was suggested that Jens Reich, GDR civil  rights activist and presidential candidate, address the central  commemorative event.    A federal president -- even if only just elected -- who  knows  his job, could have given the event commemorating the resistance  against the Nazis the right direction and setting. Yet, now  narrow-minded people and busybodies have taken possession of  this day.    All of a sudden, a longstanding controversy has flared up  over exhibits on show in the German Resistance Memorial. The  son of Hitler's attacker, Claus Graf Schenk von Stauffenberg,  Franz Ludwig, has criticized the involvement of the "Free  Germany National Committee," which, under communist guidance,  recruited resistance fighters against Hitler in the Soviet  prisoner-of-war camp Krasnogorsk.    The head of the memorial has threatened to resign if  exhibits  were indeed removed. Steinbach: "Resistance is indivisible."    In defiance of Steinbach, the Berlin celebrations are to be  fashioned as a traditional opportunity for the military --  because Stauffenberg and many of his coconspirators were  nationalist German officers. The Bundeswehr will provide an  honorary formation.    For the chancellor it will be perfect. For him, 20 July will  fit into a series of appearances with publicity appeal and a  military background.    On 31 August, he is planning to walk through the Brandenburg  Gate together with Russian President Boris Yeltsin. On 8  September, he will celebrate the withdrawal of the allied forces  in a pompous act in Berlin.    This is more than ample compensation for the head of the  German Government for not having been permitted to participate  in the D-Day celebrations on the 50th anniversary of the allied  invasion in Normandy, which he would have wanted so much.    Now there would still be time enough for Herzog to show the  chancellor who is the first man in the state: A clarifying word  with the chancellor should not be so difficult for the head of  state. Yet Weizsaecker's successor has not exchanged a single  word with the chancellor since the day after his election. He  has already set his mind on his next test.    On 8 May 1995 it will be 50 years since World War II ended.  Who will speak on that day? Roman Herzog believes that it will  be the president. Herzog has already told the public that he  would hold his speech "with unrelenting truth and frank words."    This man has learned quickly from the chancellor.</p>

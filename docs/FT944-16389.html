			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: Ifil adds FFr1.5bn to Saint Louis war chest Saint Louis, the French food and paper group, is to strengthen its war chest for possible acquisitions with a FFr1.5bn (Dollars 280m) capital increase reserved exclusively for Ifil, the industrial holding company of Italy's powerful Agnelli family. The deal is the result of an agreement earlier this year between Saint Louis' two main shareholders - Ifil and Worms, the French holding group - to equalise their stakes in the interest of exercising co-control of Saint Louis. The effect of the capital increase, which will be put to Saint Louis shareholders on November 18, will be to raise the stake of the Agnelli family holding in Saint Louis to 25.9 per cent from 15.7 per cent, while that of Worms will fall to 27.8 per cent from 31.6 per cent. The Saint Louis board will propose a three-for-one stock split at the November 18 shareholders' meeting. Mr Umberto Agnelli, chairman of Ifil, hailed the chance to raise his investment in a food and paper group during a general upturn in the economy, and said it would not require additional resources from Ifil. The latter is paying half in cash and half in shares of Danone, the French food group (formerly BSN), at the rate of two Danone shares for one Saint Louis share. This will raise Saint Louis' stake in Danone to 3.8 per cent from 2.4 per cent. Saint Louis ruled out any possibility that the group might use its new resources to make a bid for Danone. The French group said its war chest was put at FFr7bn with about a third in cash, another third in Danone shares and a further third in Saint Louis' Panzalim joint venture with Danone. Even though it only helped create Panzalim in July, Saint Louis is apparently ready to sell its 33.4 per cent stake in the venture if it needs the money to fund an acquisition.</p>

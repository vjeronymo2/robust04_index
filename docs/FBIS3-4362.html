In this way, the source hinted at the  possibility that China may abstain from voting should it be  forced to express its final stand on the issue of imposing  sanctions against North Korea.    China's stand on the nuclear issue is clear. It is calling  for a settlement through dialogue between countries and  organizations concerned, insisting that sanctions or pressure  "will complicate the situation and create tension on the Korean  peninsula," (according to Premier Li Peng). Reportedly, China  at the UNSC is asking other permanent members of the Security  Council not to impose sanctions against North Korea. It is also  said that China's true intention is to avoid the possibility of  being forced to say either "yes" or "no" to the sanctions.    Regarding China's possible reaction at the UNSC, the source  pointed out a "subtle change" in speeches made by Chinese  officials at the UNSC on the nuclear issue. The source said  that although Chinese leaders were saying at the initial stage  that they would "oppose" applying sanctions against or pressure  on North Korea, they are now saying that China will "not  approve" it. For example, Premier Li Peng said during his  January meeting with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and at a news  conference held on 22 March that China would "not approve"  sanctions against North Korea. According to the source, this  change is an indication that China after all will not oppose the  idea of imposing sanctions against North Korea but will choose  not to vote.</p>

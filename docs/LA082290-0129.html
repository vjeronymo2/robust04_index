			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> CONTINENTAL AIRLINES DRAWS FINE  </P> <P> Continental Airlines was fined $101,050 today after pleading no contest to  violating air pollution laws by improperly handling ozone-depleting chemicals  at a Los Angeles International Airport maintenance facility.  </P> <P> The airline was also placed on three years' informal probation by Municipal  Court Judge Susan Isacoff.  </P> <P> The sentence was imposed after the airline pleaded no contest to 20 health and  safety code violations of South Coast Air Quality Management District rules.  </P> <P> Deputy City Atty. Teresa Lujan said the charges grew out of violations  discovered during inspections in April and May, 1989, at the Continental  maintenance facility where airplanes are stripped and repainted. During the  stripping process, the airline utilized equipment that used hazardous chemicals  without permits and in violation of permit requirements.  </P></p>

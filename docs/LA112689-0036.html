			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTIQUES: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> ENGLISH BONE CHINA  </P> <P> ONE OF THE great contributions made to the world by the English potteries in  North Staffordshire was the development of bone china in the early 19th  Century. Tradition holds that the technique was discovered by one of the local  potters, Josiah Spode, who was looking for an inexpensive way to duplicate true  porcelain, that splendid product that had been imported from China for more  than 200 years. Spode's bone china turned out to be very much like Chinese  porcelain: He simply added bone ash to kaolin and feldspar (discovered at the  time in Cornwall) in order to make a paste more manageable in the kiln than  porcelain. In addition, it was lighter, whiter and easier to decorate than  either true "China" or the hard-paste porcelain favored by the Continental  potters at Meissen and Sevres.  </P> <P> European porcelains in the 18th Century -- the "hard pastes" made in imitation  of Chinese pottery and the French and English "soft pastes" -- were soon  superseded by Spode's invention. It was a better product in every way, and the  bone china of the early 18th Century is virtually the same material that is  used today in England and elsewhere for tablewares.  </P> <P> For many years Spode, Son and Copeland (Copeland was the London representative  of the firm whose family eventually took over the business) was the finest mark  of English bone china. In addition, Josiah Spode II, the son of Josiah Spode,  became one of the first English potters to apply gilding to bone china, making  many handsome adaptations (known as "Japans") of Japanese Imari ware. The  variety of objects made from bone china and decorated lavishly by Spode is  without end: punch bowls, mugs, sugar boxes, butter tubs, roll trays, supper  plates, broth bowls, toast racks, steak dishes, radish trays, cheese toasters,  scent jars, ink stands, card racks, snuff boxes, rouge pots and violet baskets.  Bone china, of course, was produced by many other Staffordshire potters during  the 19th and 20th centuries: Minton, Worcester, Coalport -- and so on.  </P> <P> Prices vary considerably, depending on the age of the porcelain: mugs of  various sizes for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, 1897, $75 to $250; a  blue-and-white oval foot bath with handles, 18 inches wide, late 18th Century,  $1,500 to $2,600; Copeland Spode blue, red and gilt revolving tray on stand  with six matching cups and saucers, $400 to $500, and George III tea service,  each piece hand-enameled on a white ground, $700.  </P> <P>  Look for English bone china at Robert Stewart Reed and Charles Gill, both in  Los Angeles; Richard Gould, Main Street Antiques, and Something Old, Something  Nouveau, all in Santa Monica; Roberta Gauthey and Richard Yeakel, both in  Laguna Beach; Panache Unlimited in Fullerton; Jay's Antiques and Green Dolphin  Street Antiques, both in Pasadena.  </P> <P> </P></p>

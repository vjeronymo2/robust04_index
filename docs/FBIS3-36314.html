			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Eduard Ediberidze: "In the Cabinet of Ministers. </F> From Principled and Serious Positions"]    [Excerpt] The commercial port of Poti is to become the  biggest joint-stock company in Georgia. The Georgian Cabinet of  Ministers agreed in principle to transforming this state  enterprise, the biggest in the republic, into a joint-stock  company during its regular session held on 26 January under the  chairmanship of Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia. Out of the whole  block of shares of this future joint-stock company, which,  according to preliminary calculations, will amount to 307.8  billion rubles, 51 percent will be kept by the state while the  remaining 49 percent will be owned by the port's collective,  Poti city administration, and others wanting to buy shares both  in the near abroad and in other foreign countries. This will  provide the opportunity to attract solid investments for both  the port and the city and the development of its infrastructure.  It is significant that it is planned to organize the  registration of shares in the port of Poti at the world's  leading stock exchanges. The port, which assumes the function  of a key base along the Eurasian transport corridor, will serve  not only Georgia but also Armenia and Azerbaijan and 12 more  countries. As Deputy Prime Minister Zurab Kervalishvili said,  it is planned that, following the port's reconstruction and  expansion and the building of new terminals, the volume of  freight traffic handled by it will increase from between 3 and 4  million to 15 million tonnes within the next two years alone.  Moreover, according to estimates, this will ensure that the  republic receives $120 million.    It was the unanimous opinion of those participating in the  session that the transformation of the port of Poti into a  joint- stock company should become a model for all state  enterprises and organizations that are to become joint-stock  companies.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 2 TASS -- The Council of the Federation,  upper chamber of the Russian Parliament, voted to complete the  discussion of the 1994 federal budget in one hour, but even two  hours were not enough for this. Chairman of the Chamber's  Budget Committee Nikolay Gonchar told ITAR-TASS during the break  that the mps would spend as much time on this problem as  necessary. "This is the main item on today's agenda," he added.    Gonchar explained that the deliberations were held behind  closed doors because the chamber was discussing defence  allocations. "The search for compromises is proceeding against  the background of a very keen debate, because everybody is short  of money," he stated. The mps plan to offer the state duma,  which approved the draft budget in first reading, to discuss  anew several items in the spendings part of the draft.    "Faced with the choice of whether to have good relations  with  the government or to uphold the interests of the state, the mps  will definitely choose the latter," Gonchar believes. He  stressed that "there is no factional or political struggle in  the upper chamber, but merely a dispute over regional  interests". "We are apparently faced with the need to  redistribute the available means, and this is a very painful  process," he added. Gonchar also said that his committee was  backing the stand assumed by the chairman of the Duma Committee  for Economic Affairs Sergey Glazyev, but several economic acts  were needed to implement his proposals and this would take time.</p>

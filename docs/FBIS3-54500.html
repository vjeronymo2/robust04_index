			<p>Language: <F P=105>Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Early this month, Islamic Resistance fighters  carried out a daring operation against a Ba'th Party official in  al-Hashimiyah Province in al-Hillah. The heroic mujahidin  killed the official and seized the car he was driving.    The heroic mujahidin also distributed leaflets denouncing  the  regime and calling on the Iraqi masses to assist the mujahidin  in their heroic operations against the regime's mercenaries and  henchmen. The mujahidin also distributed pictures of martyr  al-Sadr, the man who triggered the Islamic revolution in Iraq.    According to our sources, there is a remarkable decline in  the Army's morale. Desertions have become frequent in the past  few days. Army officers have told our sources that they are on  the side of the masses and only waiting for the appropriate  moment to prove this. The regime has taken repressive measures  against Army deserters but the measures have proved futile.    Elsewhere, the so-called emergency forces [quwwat  al-tawari']  have been deployed in every governorate. These forces, under  the pretext of training, have carried out successive sweeps in  residential areas in various governorates according to a weekly  timetable. Our sources in the south say that random arrests  accompany the sweeps and that hundreds of innocent youths have  been detained. In one incident, the emergency forces demolished  a house after coming under fire and failing to determine the  source. The incident occurred in the Nadir al-Thalith district  of al-Hillah.    A kangaroo court of the tyrant's regime has handed down  sentences of 10-20 years to the remaining detainees who were  still on trial in connection with the Sha'ban [March 1991]  uprising. The detainees have been transferred to the notorious  Abu-Ghurayb Prison. The overwhelming majority of those involved  in the Sha'ban revolution have been liquidated through mass  executions or brutal torture.</p>

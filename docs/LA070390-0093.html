			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPRAY PAINT BAN PROPOSED  </P> <P> City and state officials Monday announced a legislative proposal calling for a  ban on selling spray-paint cans to all but commercial users.  </P> <P> Officials say the bill, being drafted by state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles),  is necessary because police have been unable to arrest graffiti vandals, many  of whom work in late-night teams.  </P> <P> If the bill passes, sellers could sell spray paint to customers 18 years and  older, but, beginning Jan. 1, 1991, would have to lock cans away.  </P> <P> By January, 1992, spray cans would be available only to commercial businesses.  </P> <P> The bill also calls for sellers who violate the restrictions to pay fines of  $50 per can or $1,000, whichever is greater.  </P></p>

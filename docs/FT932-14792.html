			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: Alcan stays in red with loss of Dollars 20m ALCAN Aluminium, the Canadian aluminium producer, has fallen deeper into the red with net losses of USDollars 20m, or 11 cents a share, for the first quarter of 1993, compared with losses of Dollars 15m, or 9 cents, a year earlier. The group's first-quarter sales fell by 6 per cent to Dollars 1.73bn, due to depressed fabricated metal prices. The recession in Japan affected Alcan's results. Its share of equity-accounted companies, including Nippon Light Metal, the Japanese associate, resulted in a Dollars 2m loss, against a Dollars 22m profit. In Canada, where Alcan produces most of its ingot, the group's losses were substantially lower. US operations, which include primary, fabricated and rolled products, showed a small loss against a slight profit, but Brazil improved. The European units weakened, especially in Italy and France, because of the recession. Shipments of fabricated products were down 3 per cent and average realised prices slipped 12 per cent. Ingot shipments were lower, but average prices received gained a little. Mr David Morton, chairman, said aluminium was likely to remain over-supplied in the near term, with depressed prices. Cost reduction and productivity gains remained the top priority.</p>

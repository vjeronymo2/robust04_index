			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 17-YEAR-OLD STABBED IN BURBANK GANG DISPUTE  </P> <P> A 17-year-old Burbank boy was in extremely critical condition Friday after he  was stabbed several times during a gang dispute, Burbank police said.  </P> <P> The boy, whose name was not released, was found collapsed in the street in the  1600 block of Edison Road at 4:30 p.m. Thursday, Sgt. Don Goldberg said.  </P> <P> He was taken to St. Joseph Medical Center, where he underwent surgery to remove  one lung and was in the intensive care unit Friday, Goldberg said.  </P> <P> Witnesses told investigators that the teen-ager had been stabbed during a  street fight and staggered about a block before collapsing, Goldberg said.  </P> <P> "It is definitely a gang-related stabbing," Goldberg said. "It appears the  young man got into a verbal altercation with several members from an opposing  gang and then was stabbed several times in the back."  </P> <P> Goldberg said detectives had no suspects, and the identity of the assailants'  gang was not known.  </P></p>

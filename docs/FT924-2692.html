			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Shephard to scrap funding for union ballots THE GOVERNMENT yesterday removed a further plank of state support from trade unionism and collective bargaining by announcing the phased withdrawal of financial aid for secret ballots and trade union training. The sums of money are not large - unions received Pounds 4m last year for ballots and Pounds 2m for training - but the announcement is a further blow to union hopes of opening a dialogue with the government and re-establishing some national influence. Yesterday Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, justified the withdrawal of public subsidy for ballots by saying: 'Fewer than 50 per cent of employees have their pay determined, directly or indirectly, by negotiations between employers and trade unions.' The government will meet 75 per cent of the cost of ballots in 1993-94, 50 per cent in 1994-95, 25 per cent in 1995-96. There will then be no further payments. Funding for secret ballots, introduced in 1980, was initially rejected by the Trades Union Congress, but last night Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, described the move as 'a vicious and calculated blow to destroy state support for good union practice'. Mrs Shephard has spoken of the 'war' with the unions being at an end, but the government has continued taking the axe to union-supported institutions such as the National Economic Development Council. The employment bill, currently at committee stage in the Commons and likely to become law early next year, continues that policy. The bill proposes to abolish Wages Councils, which set minimum wages for 2.5m workers, and to abolish the duty of Acas, the government conciliation service, to encourage the extension of collective bargaining. Yesterday the clause in the bill that requires employees to agree every three years to the automatic deduction of union subscriptions from their pay packets was passed by 13 votes to 12. The unions fear that reform to 'check-off' might cause the loss of as many as 20 per cent of members and lead to further financial pressure on unions.</p>

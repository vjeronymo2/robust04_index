			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Gentlemen: When Israel talks about the kind of  peace it is interested in, it does not hesitate to launch a  campaign of allegations and accusations, and to claim that it  has provided what is needed to make progress in the peace  process possible. Nor does it hesitate to claim that the Arab  party is responsible for halting this progress. It does not  conceal that it wants complete Arab recognition, an end to the  Arab boycott, open borders, established diplomatic and economic  ties, and so forth, without its officials uttering the words  "complete withdrawal," which they have all failed to say so far.    Here, we can see the large gap separating Israel's proposals  and the principles and foundations of the peace process,  particularly the UN resolutions on whose basis the regional  peace process started. The Israeli leaders are apparently still  gambling on drawing Syria into bargaining over land and rights,  despite the conviction that it is impossible to make peace with  Syria without returning the entire Syrian Golan Heights, without  Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, and  without establishing just and comprehensive peace in an area  that will not see stability or tranquility without a just  solution and a comprehensive peace.    As long as the Israelis insist on marketing their own  concept  of peace, their own excuses for keeping land, and their own  incomplete view of peace in the region -- a view based on  individual solutions and unilateral deals -- it is only natural  that the climate of disappointment persists.    Political observers in the Arab and international arenas  realize that Israel is responsible for these disappointments and  for the failure of international efforts so far to achieve any  results. They realize Israel is responsible for the failure to  resume the bilateral talks, and, consequently, for not achieving  any progress worth mentioning in the entire peace process.    Therefore, the whole world now realizes, more than at any  time before, what direction has to be followed, and where  pressure should be applied to activate the peace process and  save what is left of it in a responsible and serious way.    We do not think anyone in this world wants Arabs to  relinquish their rights and their land, or to abandon the most  basic principles on which the peace process was based. This  would not achieve peace. Even if it was achieved superficially  in one aspect, it would not survive. In this case, it would be  an empty peace, lacking the most basic principles of continuity.    Establishing peace and seizing the opportunities available  today to achieve it require, before anything else, a commitment  to implementing the UN resolutions in letter and spirit, and  complete withdrawal to the borders that existed before the  aggression of June 1967. Only then will the statement on  goodwill, which the Israelis keep bragging about, come forth.  The occupied territories are Arab and the usurped rights are  Arab, not the opposite.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 23 (CNA) -- In an attempt to speed up  Taiwan's bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,  or GATT, the government is working to further open domestic  service markets, a ranking government official said Thursday [23  June].    Hsiao Wan-chang, chairman of the Council for Economic  Planning and Development (CEPD), noted that the "initial  commitment list" of service industries will come out by the end  of this month.    The strategy to promote the liberalization of the service  sector -- a requirement to become a GATT member -- also fit  into the government's ambition to build Taiwan into an  Asia-Pacific business- operations center, Hsiao stressed.    Taiwan, which has observer status with the Geneva-based  world  trade regulating body, is expected to become a full member by  the end of the year.    The CEPD service-liberalization task force has reached a  preliminary consensus on the service-opening package, Hsiao  pointed out.    He said the government is set to open the import-export  shipping container trafficking business in accordance with an  amendment to the highway law, and will relax restrictions on  foreigners who want to work as tour guides, with the residency  requirement for a foreign guide being lowered from three years  to six months.    In telecommunications, he said, the government must adjust  its monopolistic hold over local, long-distance, international,  and cellular phone services.    The value-added network service market will also be open to  foreigners in a step-by-step approach upon the completion of the  revised telecommunications law, he said.    Moreover, he said, foreign insurance companies will be  allowed to open branches in Taiwan in line with the revision of  the guidelines on permits for foreign insurance companies, which  is expected to be completed by the end of August. Currently,  only US insurance firms are allowed to operate here.    Restrictions on foreign banks' establishing branches will  also be relaxed. A foreign bank is now allowed to open three  branches here annually.</p>

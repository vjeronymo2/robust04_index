			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MORE WARRANTS SERVED IN PROBE OF SPORTS  BETTING  </P> <P> The investigation continued Thursday into illegal sports betting rings that  Tuesday led to eight arrests in Los Angeles and Orange counties.  </P> <P> Orange County sheriff's deputies on Thursday served additional search warrants  in the case, calling it one of the largest illegal sports betting operations  ever to operate in the area.  </P> <P> Eight suspected bookmakers were arrested Tuesday night in Los Angeles and  Orange counties. Searches yielded ledgers and computerized records that Orange  County Sheriff's Sgt. Bob Giles said appear to contain the coded identities of  hundreds of bettors.  </P> <P> "Right now, we're in the process of breaking down a number of codes (into)  names and telephone numbers," Giles said. He said that bettors, as well  bookmakers, will be prosecuted for illegal gambling when they are identified.  </P> <P> The operation involved using employees of popular Orange County bars and  restaurants as agents to take bets on professional and collegiate baseball,  football, basketball, hockey and horse racing. Deputies financed the costs of  their undercover investigation by placing winning bets on basketball's Los  Angeles Lakers and baseball's Oakland Athletics.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, sheriff's detectives served search warrants on homes in Norwalk,  Lakewood and Bellflower as well as Anaheim.  </P></p>

			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Doubt cast on PM's resignation Harold Macmillan may have been calculating his resignation as prime minister earlier than it appeared when he was suddenly admitted to hospital in October 1965. An unsigned and undated draft letter from Macmillan to 'Rab' Butler, the foreign secretary, marked 'not sent', shows that the prime minister had made up his mind to resign before entering hospital. Newspapers at the time were told that a decision on his future depended on the outcome of the operation - but the letter indicates that the prime minister had already made his decision. It says: 'As you know I am going into hospital for some weeks to have an operation for prostate trouble. This blow to my health has made me decide that I should, when I am well enough to see the Queen, resign my position as prime minister and leader of the party. 'I do not propose to announce this decision at this stage. But I should be grateful if you and any members whom you care to consult would decide how best to apply this decision to resolving the problems which we have discussed, both in relation to the party conference at Blackpool and the succession.' The fact that the letter was never sent lends support to the conviction that Macmillan deliberately undermined Butler's ambitions to succeed him. Why it was written at all and who drafted it remain unclear.</p>

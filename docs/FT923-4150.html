			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / International Company News: Sime Darby lifted by Hong Kong operations SIME Darby, the Malaysia based conglomerate that has grown into one of the region's leading multinationals, has announced pre-tax profits for the year to June 30 of MDollars 755.4m (USDollars 303m), an increase of 11 per cent on the previous year's figure. Turnover was also up 11 per cent at MDollars 6.19bn. The group has recommended a final gross dividend payment of 14.5 sen per share. Once largely plantation based, Sime Darby has diversified not only into other sectors of activity within Malaysia but has made substantial investments in the region. Sime's biggest cash earner was its operations in Hong Kong, where it is the main automotive and heavy equipment distributor. The group's pre-tax profits in Hong Kong were MDollars 142m against MDollars 94m a year earlier. 'Sime Darby in Hong Kong benefited from the booming economy in South China and became the highest profit earner in the group,' the company said. 'In spite of the new airport project being further delayed, the mood and business climate remains bullish.' Sime's property division also performed strongly with pre-tax profits of MDollars 112m against MDollars 93m. The group says the outlook in the Malaysian housing sector remains good, although it is reviewing operations in condominium projects, where there could be over-supply problems. Pre-tax profits in plantations almost doubled to MDollars 51m mainly due to an increase in the price of palm oil. Sime, long known as one of the more conservatively run groups in Asia, has benefited from the steady if unspectacular spread of its businesses throughout the region. It has gained from the 8 per cent plus growth rates of the economies of Malaysia and Hong Kong, which has balanced out lower growth in Singapore, the Philippines and Australia. While analysts are still concerned about the under-utilisation of Sime's large amounts of capital, they feel that the recent acquisition of the Caterpillar Tractors franchise in Australia plus its tie-up with the Axa group, one of the world's leading insurers, will lead to further growth in the years ahead. The Sime board's forecast was, however, couched in typical conservative language. It said that as a world recovery was as yet barely visible and remained a matter of conjecture, it was difficult to be too optimistic about the future. The board hoped the group would at least be able to maintain last year's level of profitability, but it would be prudent not to expect too much in a global situation still clouded by uncertainty.</p>

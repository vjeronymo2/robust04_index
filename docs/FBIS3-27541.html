			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, February 23 (XINHUA) -- Russian Presidential  Spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov today denounced the decision of  the lower house of parliament to free political prisoners who  are "anti- Yeltsin opponents."    The lawmakers at the State Duma (the lower house of  parliament) voted 253-67 for the resolution on an amnesty to  organizers of the 1991 "August 19 Event" and leaders of the  armed rebellion in the parliament building in Moscow last  October.    Kostikov stressed in a statement that the decision is  detrimental to cooperation between the president and the  newly-elected parliament.    He said that the State Duma had "not learned lessons from  the  bitter experience of the former parliament" which was dissolved  by President Boris Yeltsin after over two years of stand-off.    He accused the State Duma of "playing ruinous political  games" and struggling for power.    When the president was "making resolute steps to strengthen  the weight and dignity of Russia in the world," the State Duma  adopted decisions which would lead to destabilization and "a  weaker Russia," he said.    "This is a dangerous way," the spokesman added.    Meanwhile, Emil Paine, an aide to the Russian president,  told  reporters that Yeltsin would not approve the decision.    The aide described the Duma's amnesty decision as "an open  symbolic challenge" to the president on the eve of addressing  his state of nation message.    However, he said the decision would not delay Yeltsin's  speech which is a message to "the whole society instead of the  parliament solely."    Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Federation Council (the  upper house of parliament), said in a televised interview this  afternoon, "the public prosecutor's office and court will handle  this issue. Lawmakers should not be involved in it."    Yegor Gaydar, leader of Russia's choice, warned that the  freed rebels would retake their activities against the  president, which might result in a new bloodshed.    However, Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the Duma Committee  on CIS (the Commonwealth of Independent States) Affairs,  stressed that the amnesty and the memorandum on accord adopted  by the lawmakers would "give Russia a chance to civic  reconciliation."    Russian Communist Party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov expressed  "a  feeling of certain satisfaction" when the decision was passed by  most Duma factions.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Miljenko Karakic, including </F> recorded comments by Ivan Bender, president of Herceg-Bosna's  chamber of deputies, Herceg-Bosna defense minister Vladimir  Soljic, and Colonel General Ante Rose, Bosnian Croat Army  commander]    [Excerpts] [Karakic] The Serb army shelled several  residential buildings in Usora last night. Several civilians  were wounded and fresh material damage was caused. [passage  omitted]    [Karakic] [video shows damaged houses and Croat soldiers  with  weapons] All this shows that the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina is  not over. Senior officials of the Croat republic of  Herceg-Bosna stressed this today at a ceremony of oath-taking by  the First Guards' Brigade of the HVO [Croatian Defense Council]  in Capljina, southern Bosnia.    [Bender] Since you know very well what is going on in  Gorazde, in Posavina in northern Bosnia, and our Usora, we must  keep that in mind at all times. You are the people who will  stand with us on the bulwark of our homeland, and we must always  think of those who have given all they had, who have given their  lives.    [Soljic] We will fight for the Croats to have the right to  decide for themselves on their future. If we create a joint  army, that army will be formed so that one nation can never use  it against the other, as it happened with the so-called Yugoslav  People's Army. There is a lot of talk about the end of the war  and demobilization. Unfortunately, an end to the war is not in  sight yet, and therefore, we cannot speak about a large-scale  demobilization. We will use the cease-fire to consolidate (?our  forces) and divide the burden of the war more equally.    [Roso] You have heard enough wise words and phrases. There  is one eternal truth: The war will never be over for us. I will  repeat it once again if someone does not understand Croatian  well: The war is not over. This much about the future.    Personally, I congratulate you today. I will place one thing  upon your conscience. Bow only before the memory of this oath  and before our dead. Do not entrust Croat weapons into anyone's  hands. Thank you very much.    [Karakic] The oath-taking ceremony in Capljina was attended  by many guests from the military and political ranks of  Herzeg-Bosna, and by relatives of the Croat patriot Ante Bruno  Busic after whom the HVO's First Guards' Brigade has been named.

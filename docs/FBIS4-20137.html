			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Theo Waigel by Peter De </F> Thier in Washington on 25 April: "Waigel Contradicts IMF  Forecasts"]    [Text] Washington, 25 Apr -- Federal Finance Minister Theo  Waigel does not share the IMF's pessimism about Germany's  prospects for growth. In a SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG interview at  the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank Spring Conference in  Washington, Waigel said that he was banking on a growth rate of  1.5 percent for Germany as a whole. The U.S. Government has not  sought to pressure Germany into lowering its interest rates;  U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen knows how to value the  independence of the Bundesbank. That aside, the United States  has taken account of the fact that interest rates in the FRG are  at a historically low level.    [De Thier] The FRG does not fare that well in the IMF world  economic report. A growth rate of only 0.7 percent is expected  for 1994. How can demands for moves to stimulate the economy be  reconciled with your plans to consolidate the budget?    [Haider] I do not share the IMF's views on the prospects for  growth. I am of the opinion that the report does not take  sufficient account of the upturn in eastern Germany. The  Federal Government believes that this year a growth rate of 1.5  percent can be achieved for Germany as a whole. Favorable  interest rates compared with the United States and the downward  trend in inflation will further improve the overall situation.  The IMF world economic outlook also contains a very positive  assessment of our fiscal policy. The Federal Government's  medium-term consolidation course is also considered a positive  sign.    [De Thier] The IMF and the U.S. Government are demanding  tougher measures to introduce more flexibility into the labor  market. What can be implemented in the medium term in this  respect?    [Waigel] We already dealt with that exhaustively at the G-7  summit in Detroit. Everybody is in agreement on the need for  more flexible labor markets. We need lower wage settlements to  prevent production costs from rising. With respect to part-time  work, we are well behind internationally, but in the case of  support for medium-sized business, we are envied by our partner  countries. In the case of greater flexibility, each country  must do something by itself. However, we have laid emphasis on  some important points with the Federal Government's action  program.    [De Thier] Despite the latest reductions in key interest  rates, your U.S. counterpart has repeatedly said that the  Bundesbank has more scope for reducing interest rates further.  Did the United States apply more pressure during the G-7 summit?    [Waigel] The U.S. Government has not made any more demands  on Germany. Treasury Secretary Bentsen knows how to value the  independence of the Bundesbank. The U.S. and the other G-7  ministers explicitly welcomed the fact that the Bundesbank has  used the scope available to it for interest rate cuts and in the  short term, we are two percentage points behind last year's  levels. The United States has also taken into account the fact  that interest rates in the FRG have almost reached a  historically low level and are still below long-term interest  rates in the United States.    [De Thier] In view of the downward trend in interest rates  in the United States and Germany, are you afraid that capital  will leave the country?    [Waigel] Not at all, because in the end, the interest rate  decisions in both countries were made in a way that has not  caused tension in the exchange rates. The German mark's  exchange rate in relation to the dollar has remained stable. As  Germany's balance of payments -- including invisible trade --  deficit is declining, we also expect this stability to remain.    [De Thier] It is known that at the IMF, the Federal  Government is opposed to issuing new drawing rights to the  successor republics to the Soviet Union. How do you view the  alternatives, such as the redistribution of the drawing rights  that are already available?    [Waigel] We are ready to consider all alternatives to  issuing new drawing rights. Of course, the IMF must see to it  that the new member countries have a chance to participate in  all the special drawing rights that are available.</p>

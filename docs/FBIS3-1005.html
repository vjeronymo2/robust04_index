At a news conference in Pretoria, de  Klerk referred to right-wingers who regard the 31 March as  so-called D-day. Linda van Tilburg reports:    At the end of the weekly cabinet meeting de Klerk said  tonight that the right-wing is apparently planning to declare a  homeland in several parts of the country on the last day in  March. He said there is talk of the occupation of towns and  sabotage. De Klerk also said plans are being made by the  government, the Independent Electoral Commission, and the  Transitional Executive Council to ensure that the election does  take place in kwaZulu-Natal. Referring to confusion among civil  servants in places like Ciskei, concerning their jobs and  pensions, De Klerk gave the assurance tonight that the interim  constitution guarantees these rights.</p>

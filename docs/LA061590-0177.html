			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> AUTOS GIVE PUSH AS INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT REBOUNDS 0.6% IN MAY  </P> <P> Industrial production rebounded 0.6% in May from a flat performance a month  earlier because of accelerated automobile production, the Federal Reserve said  today.  </P> <P> "A rebound from last month's sharp decline in motor vehicle production  accounted for much of the May increase in industrial production," the central  bank's report said.  </P> <P> "Excluding motor vehicles and parts, industrial production increased 0.2% in  May and 0.4% in April."  </P> <P> The Fed also reported the operating rate of the nation's factories, mines and  utilities -- which usually move in tandem with industrial production -- rose  0.3 of a percentage point to 83.6% in May. The operating rate measures not only  output but also changes in productivity levels.  </P> <P> Industrial production has risen each month since January except for April when  it was unchanged. The flat April figure was revised from a 0.4% decline first  reported last month.  </P> <P> Output was up 0.9% in February and 0.5% in March. It dropped 1% during the  first month of 1990.  </P></p>

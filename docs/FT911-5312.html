			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / UK Company News: William Jacks Pounds 0.9m in red Interest costs and losses from an associate pushed William Jacks, the motor group, Pounds 872,000 into the red in the year to January 31. There was a particularly severe downturn in the last quarter of the year, with 'very disappointing' sales in the normally buoyant month of January, the company said. On turnover down at Pounds 42.6m (Pounds 46.25m) operating profits were reduced to Pounds 272,000 (Pounds 1.17m). Interest charges amounted to Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 802,000) partly due to the financing of exceptionally high stocks of unsold new cars delivered on consignment terms. There was a Pounds 41,000 (Pounds 15,000) loss from associated undertakings. Losses per share came through at 6.76p (2.09p earnings) and the directors said there would be no dividend until there was an appreciable improvement in trading conditions. They expected a gradual recovery beginning in the second half of the year.</p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Spain on path to recovery Spain's recession bottomed out in the final quarter of 1993 and the economy is set to recover very slowly this year, according to forecasts by the Bank of Spain, writes Tom Burns in Madrid. The central bank said annualised gross domestic product fell 0.9 per cent last September against a drop of 1.4 per cent in June. By December, it believed the economy had ceased to shrink. Final data for last year would show that GDP fell 0.9 per cent, in line with the mid-year figure and in accordance with the finance ministry's projections, the bank said. Registered unemployment in Spain rose 63,000 last month, little changed from a year earlier, according to new figures. The total stood at 2.7m, 17.9 per cent of the working population.</p>

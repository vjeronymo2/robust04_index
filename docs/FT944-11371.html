			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Opposition split on job ban for MPs A split emerged among senior opposition politicians yesterday over calls for a ban on non-parliamentary work by MPs to end the recent stream of allegations of impropriety. Amid further allegations about payments to Mr Jonathan Aitken, Treasury secretary, and Lord Callaghan, the former Labour prime minister, leading Labour politicians appeared to disagree on restricting MPs to a single paid job. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, told BBC Radio that MPs should be prevented from doing anything for money 'except the job that they do through the ballot box'. MPs should have one duty. 'That duty is to the people who elect them. If they want to do other things, that's fine . . . but they should not be paid for them,' he said. Mr Ashdown's comments were in line with calls by Mr John Prescott, Labour's deputy leader, on Saturday for MPs to rebuild public confidence in parliament by restricting themselves to a single paid job. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, told BBC Television that full-time MPs ought not to take part-time work outside parliament. But he appeared to distance himself from Mr Prescott. He said: 'I don't think you can ban second paid jobs. I don't think you can legislate for people not writing articles or not doing this or that.' Mr Brown defended Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow trade and industry secretary, who declares three business consultancies in the Commons register of MPs' interests. He said: 'That is not a second job as such, but there are some people who actually work more outside the House of Commons than inside, and that's not anybody on our side.' Conservative leaders, including Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, are opposed to a move towards full-time MPs, which they say would reduce outside input to political decision making. Mr Aitken, who has denied media allegations that part of his bill at Mr Mohamed Fayed's Ritz hotel in Paris was paid by a business associate, dismissed suggestions in The Observer newspaper that he did not declare a directorship of a company linked to the Saudi royal family. The Treasury drew attention to Mr Aitken's earlier statement that he had never been guilty of any impropriety in the conduct of any of his responsibilities as an MP. Lord Callaghan admitted claims in the Mail on Sunday that he failed to declare a Pounds 12,500 payment from the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International. But he said the money was intended to pay for a secretary in connection with a Third World project undertaken after he left the Commons. 'This was nothing to do with my work as an MP,' he said.</p>

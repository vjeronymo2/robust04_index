			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Agreement on ITV proposals THE ITV companies will today deliver their detailed proposals to the Independent Television Commission on how the regional TV system will be run over the next 10 years. After months of negotiation, the 15 companies said they had reached agreement on everything from how the new central scheduler system will operate to relations with independent producers. The detailed proposals now have to be agreed by the ITC, although the general principles have already been accepted. The package will then be submitted to the Office of Fair Trading, which is expected to hold hearings and announce its verdict by the end of the summer.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text]  <H5>  Announcement on INTAS Research Grants for 1993 -- 509 </H5> Projects of Scientific Cooperation With the Former Soviet Union  Launched    -- At its General Assembly meeting on 21st December 1993,  the  INTAS Association (International Association for the Promotion  of Cooperation with Scientists from the Independent States of  the Former Soviet Union), set up at the initiative of the  European Commission, has adopted 509 cooperation projects  between laboratories in West Europe and in the Former Soviet  Union (FSU). The total contribution made by the INTAS  Association to these projects amounts to 21 million ECU.    -- ``With this portfolio of projects, declared Prof.  Antonio,  Commissioner in charge of research at the European Commission,  the INTAS Association constitutes one of the major actors and  key elements in scientific cooperation between Western Europe  and the former Soviet Union republics''.    -- Each project associates a minimum of two laboratories in  Western European countries and one in a FSU country. In total,  1214 FSU laboratories and 1754 of the INTAS member States  laboratories are involved in the action.    -- Covering a wide spectrum of disciplines in exact and  natural sciences (physics, astrophysics, mathematics, chemistry,  life sciences, Earth sciences, environment); applied sciences  and technologies (engineering sciences, aeronautics, space,  etc.) and social, economic and human sciences, these projects  represent frontier research and are based on cooperation with  mutual benefit. Involvement in these joint activities will  permit research teams of the New Independent States to stay in  their laboratories and get to continue their work at an  international level.    -- The funds awarded by INTAS to the FSU laboratories are  essentially to cover the renumeration of their scientists; the  funds directed to the Western European laboratories will cover  project coordination costs.    -- The 509 projects are the result of a call for submission  of research proposals launched just after the setting up of  INTAS and with the deadline of 15 October 1993. The large number  of proposals received were evaluated by the Council of  Scientists of the Association, which consists of eminent  scientists from the European Union and the New Independent  States.    -- These projects represent a second wave of projects  launched by INTAS. A first wave of 54 projects were launched in  June 1993 for a total amount of 4 million ECU.    -- New INTAS Association activities are foreseen for 1994  and  should be announced in the beginning of this year.    -- INTAS Association groups the European Union, its twelve  Member States, Austria, Finland, Switzerland and all of the  independent states of the former Soviet Union (Armenia,  Azerbaidjan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldovia,  Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan). It  was officially set up on 29 June 1993 by the first meeting of  its General Assembly.  <H5>  Additional Information </H5>   Secretariat of INTAS Association    8, Square de Meeus    B-1040 Brussels    Belgium</p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Big three car stocks help Dow advance Wall Street A STRONG performance from the big three US auto makers contributed to solid gains on Wall Street yesterday, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average blue chip indicator finished 25.26 ahead at 3,333.18 following moderate volume on the New York SE totalling 206.8m shares. Advancing issues led those declining by 1,092 to 606. Among other market indices, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 registered a rise of 2.91 at 412.02. The advance was more pronounced in the secondary market, where the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks climbed 9.61 to 569.94. Although there were some economic data to digest in the form of personal income and spending for March, the stock market focused on corporate news. There was no discernible reaction to the 0.6 per cent increase in personal income in the month or the 0.3 per cent rise in personal consumption expenditures. Motor company stocks dominated big board trading on the back of encouraging first-quarter results, with General Motors moving ahead Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 42 3/8 , Chrysler Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 19 5/8 and Ford Dollars 2 to Dollars 45 3/4 . Ford reported first-quarter earnings of 60 cents a share, including a special gain of 13 cents, against a loss of Dollars 1.88 previously. On Tuesday, GM turned in its first quarterly profit in 1 1/2 years thanks to a smaller loss from its core North American vehicle business. Eastman Kodak, which unveiled a 19 per cent drop in first-quarter profits on flat sales after the close of trading on Tuesday, moved forward Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 40. The photographic equipment maker warned Wall Street in March that it would have a difficult first quarter. Among other active blue chip issues, Pepsico appreciated Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 35 1/2 on top of its Tuesday Dollars 1 gain, Boeing slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 43 7/8 and Glaxo eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 25 3/8 . Cooper Industries fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 50 1/4 after Salomon cut its investment rating on the stock and reduced its earnings estimates for the company. Exxon held steady at Dollars 59 1/4 after the company increased its quarterly dividend to 72 cents a share from 67 cents. Bethlehem Steel improved Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 14 in spite of once more omitting its dividend. Delta Air Lines put on Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 59 3/8 after the big US airline said it had trimmed Dollars 5bn from its nine-year capital spending plan. AMR, parent of American Airlines, lost Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 66 1/2 and USAir rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 13 3/4 . Among actively-traded over-the-counter stocks, Microsoft rose Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 111 3/8 and Intel added Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 52 1/8 . Canada TORONTO blue chips gained ground but the broad market ended on a mixed note. Traders said the Ontario budget, due to be released after the market closes today, was putting a damper on equities. The market is expecting tax rises and a record deficit. The composite index ended 19.1 up at 3,357.0, but declines led rises by 278 to 262. Volume amounted to 23.3m shares. Imasco reported higher first-quarter earnings and said analysts are on track with estimates for 1992 net of CDollars 2.95 to CDollars 3.05 a share, compared with 1991 net of CDollars 2.56. The stock was up CDollars 1 to CDollars 37. Biochem Pharma plunged CDollars 5 3/8 to CDollars 17 5/8 . The company said it was not aware of any reason for the decline, and said it intends to proceed with an issue of up to 3.5m common shares in late May. Biochem had surged from CDollars 21 last June to CDollars 35 1/4 this year, even after a stock split, amid optimism about its anti-Aids 3TC drug.</p>

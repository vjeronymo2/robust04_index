			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Kohl condemns Ozal over his 'Hitler' attack RELATIONS between Germany and Turkey took a further sharp turn for the worse yesterday when Chancellor Helmut Kohl angrily denounced President Turgut Ozal for comparing his policy to that of 'Hitler's Germany'. He issued a formal statement describing the Turkish leader's weekend interview as unacceptable and 'completely incomprehensible'. At the same time the row over the alleged use of German-supplied armoured cars in Turkish actions against Kurdish civilians claimed its first victim in Bonn, with the sacking of a senior defence ministry official. Mr Gerhard Stoltenberg, the defence minister, who is facing demands for his own resignation, said that Mr Wolfgang Ruppelt, head of the ministry's armaments division, had taken personal responsibility for delivering 15 Leopard tanks to Turkey last year, after the German parliament imposed a ban on the trade. Mr Stoltenberg's own position remains in doubt. The bitter confrontation between the two Nato allies has blown up with extraordinary rapidity, after Germany last week condemned the Turkish military actions against the Kurds, and suspended all arms supplies to the country. President Ozal retaliated at the weekend with an interview with Turkish journalists, accusing Germany of behaviour 'which corresponds to that of Hitler's Germany, although under different conditions'. 'Germany regards itself since its unification as a superpower,' he said. 'To prove that, it is interfering everywhere, which has certainly already been noticed in Europe. The difference with Hitler's Germany consists in the fact that today's Germany misuses its economic might, and continually trots out its threats. Germany will see in a very short time that it has chosen the wrong path.' Mr Kohl said the statements were 'unacceptable in both tone and content'. He had always declared his belief in the tradition of friendship between the German and Turkish peoples, and therefore particularly cultivated bilateral relations. He had also particularly worked for the 'constructive development' of Turkey's relationship with the European Community, the statement said. One reason for the particular vehemence of the Turkish reaction to German criticism is the perception that Bonn has been as adamant as any other EC member in blocking the country's application for EC membership, out of fear of a flood of future Turkish migrant workers. In Germany, the use of German arms against the Kurds is a particularly explosive issue, coming on the eve of two key regional elections in Baden-Wurttemberg and Schleswig-Holstein next Sunday. The German government has provided Turkey with military assistance worth DM5.5bn (Pounds 1.92bn) since the mid-1960s, according to Bonn. This included DM1.5bn worth in connection with the Gulf War - made up of 80 tanks, anti-aircraft weapons and ammunition.</p>

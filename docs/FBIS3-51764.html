			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A redesigned light industry pavilion has been  inaugurated at Expocuba. Light Industry Minister Eduardo  Fernandez Boada was present at the inauguration and was  interviewed by reporter Guillermo Bernal:    [Begin recording] [Bernal] The pavilion we have just  inaugurated contains an extensive exhibit of Cuban products.  However, I am concerned about the people's perception that,  although the exhibit stresses production capabilities, what is  displayed here is not available in stores nationwide.    [Fernandez] The goal of the exhibit is to show what Cuba is  capable of producing, not what is produced to fill store  shelves. To produce these items for nationwide public  consumption, we would need not to be in a special period: We  would have to have hundreds of millions of dollars we do not  have. However, it is important for everyone to know that the  Revolution has created these capabilities in Cuba. In the  future, the preservation and even the development of this  production capability -- I am convinced of this, whenever we  have the possibility -- will allow us to supply these items to  the people. We should not be depressed that we cannot have these  things in the stores today. It would be sad to have lost our  capability to do this, to have to import even chairs or pants.    [Bernal] Light industry is close to the Cuban family with  such products as soaps, detergents, and tooth paste. What is the  situation with these products?    [Fernandez] The goal is to try to allocate more to these  than  last year to ameliorate the problem somewhat. Personally, I  believe that the problem of systematically and adequately  providing these items cannot be solved in the short term,  because tens of millions of dollars are needed and they are just  not there. Now, there is a will, a commitment. We have preserved  the production capabilities to try to alleviate the highly  distressing shortage of these products. We are aware of this. We  may experience a slight improvement in comparison with 1993.  [end recording]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Gorbachev: "Seven Years With Risk of </F> Long-Range Consequences"]    [Text] Bryansk Oblast-Moscow--According to data  provided by scientists, more than 2 million people in Russia  (including 550,000 children) who reside in territory whose soil  has a cesium-137 contamination density greater than 1  curie/square kilometer were subject to the influence of  radiation in 1992. Even in view of this, the Russian  "Chernobylers" are in no hurry to abandon the contaminated zone.  Cottages that have been constructed for them lie empty.    The day following the explosion in the Belarusian Chernobyl,  a red cloud hung over the skies of Baturovka in Bryansk Oblast.  A day later, many people experienced nosebleeds. Baturovka fell  within the radioactive contamination zone, the intensity of  which presupposed mandatory resettlement of people out of these  territories...    To this day people in the zone have been trying to live the  way they did prior to 1986, as if the Chernobyl events had not  put an end to the previously established order of affairs. Farms  continue to turn over meat, milk, potatoes, and other  agricultural output to the state. Krasnogorskiy Rayon, for  example, is expected to deliver 500 tonnes of meat and 520  tonnes of milk this year. Potatoes are sold at the price of R18  per kilogram, which does not fully compensate for expenses.  Vasiliy Khandoshko, chairman of Baturovka Sovkhoz, proposed that  I act as intermediary between the sovkhoz and Moscow in selling  potatoes at R50 per kilogram. However, I refused...    They do not like instigators in Baturovka. They believe all  the problems stem from them. They are therefore very suspicions  of someone new in the area. The words "moving" and "cows" are  forbidden topics here. When cows are reluctantly discussed, it  is with the challenge: "No matter what Chernobyl horrors you  want to talk about, I will be lost without my livelihood."    Milk for human consumption in the zone is an extremely  dangerous item. Immediately following the accident, a ban was  placed on putting livestock out to pasture. Then they had the  cattle compulsorily moved out of sight and slaughtered. Local  residents reconciled themselves to the loss so long as "clean"  products were being delivered to the sovkhoz. Soon, however, the  deliveries of milk, cheese, and butter ceased. Baturovka  residents then ignored the ban and again brought in livestock.    For the older people, it is an extremely bitter pill to  abandon their native land, in which their ancestors lie and to  which they themselves have become so attached. Some are unable  to endure the ordeal of moving and pass away a year or two after  arriving at a new location. Many return.    It is not only the old people who return. Five families  returned to their sovkhoz from Zhukovskiy Rayon. Machine  operators and vehicle drivers, they were never able to find  work--only boiler operators and odd-jobs workers were needed in  the new location. And even here the money was not good and the  jobs called for "unskilled laborers." In addition, the new  settlements in question do not yet have schools, kindergartens,  or stores.    Three young families forced to leave Kyrgyzstan settled  recently in Baturovka. For about six months, Olga Zavtonova's  husband searched all over Russia for a place that could provide  housing and an opportunity to begin working. The housing  situation proved so difficult in the Russian interior that the  Zavtonovs decided to resettle here with their children--where  they were immediately provided a brick house. But Olga worries  all the same: How dangerous is it to live in Baturovka?    Nor does Vladimir Ushakov properly know the degree of danger  present. Born and raised in Baturovka, Ushakov was 17 years old  when the accident occurred. He served his time in the Army,  returned to the village, became a driver, and got married. A  year and a half ago, a child was born to the family. In  Vladimir's words, doctors are constantly checking the family for  "accumulation of radionuclides" in their bodies. Figures are  cited during every visit. But what exactly do these figures  mean? Then again, the Ushakovs do not have any particular need  to decipher them--they are better off just being quiet about  things...    P.S. In Moscow I looked up Dmitriy Chuksin, deputy  head of the Department for Environmental Monitoring and Land  Rehabilitation of the Russian Federation State Committee on  Chernobyl, and asked him to comment on the situation in Bryansk  Oblast. Chuksin initially proposed that the committee be paid a  fee for information he provided (which, as I immediately  guessed, would be directed towards implementation of the program  for eliminating the aftereffects of the accident). But in my  private conversation with him, Mr. Chuksin told me that a draft  new concept for residing in the region had been drawn up by the  committee. It was their position, he stated, that living on the  lands subject to the influence of radiation (except for the most  dangerous zones--the exclusion and resettlement zones),  including Krasnogorskiy Rayon, where this correspondent was at  the time, "entailed risk, but was possible."    Russian Academy of Sciences Professor Irina Pelevina, a  radiobiologist in charge of the laboratory for research in the  long-range consequences of the influence of radiation of the  Chemical Physics Institute, provided her commentary on this  subject:    "My own point of view often diverges from the position of  representatives of the State Committee on Chernobyl and that of  the Bryansk Oblast Administration, as well as from the opinion  of certain Russian scientists who declare the possibility of  residing 'safely' in territories suffering the consequences of  the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant."    "Human life in these regions is linked with constant  exposure  to radiation in small doses over the course of a long period of  time. This situation is fraught with long-range effects (an  example of which is the appearance of malignant tumors). The  'risk of emergence of long-range consequences' increases as the  irradiation dosage increases. But there is also a risk  associated with long-term exposure to small doses. In this  regard, such consequences may take quite some time before  becoming manifest--hence use of the word 'long-range'! For  example, leukoses usually appear after a maximum period of eight  to 10 years, tumors of all varieties--after 20-40 years."    "If we take the point of view that a 'risk of long-range  consequences' exists in inhabited regions, even with respect to  a small number of people, then it is simply criminal under such  conditions to refer to safe living."</p>

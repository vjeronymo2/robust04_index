			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Buck for Iraq arms passes to Sir Robin: The cabinet secretary will face a difficult public test at the Scott inquiry Sir Robin Butler, KCB, CVO, cabinet secretary and head of the Home Civil Service since 1988, has a reputation as a consummate mandarin, hugely experienced in the ways of Whitehall and prepared to defend them unflinchingly. Today he will face a stiff public test when he gives evidence to the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry. In an attempt to anticipate the conclusions of the Scott report, Sir Robin is expected to confirm that steps have been taken to improve intelligence gathering, and co-ordination between government departments generally. But he faces politically tricky questions about the accountability of ministers, the duties of civil servants, and his own role in co-ordinating government policy on Iraq. Since Lord Justice Scott began his inquiry, the machinery of government has come under unprecedented public scrutiny as officials and ministers have been cross-examined over their decisions during the 1980s and early 1990s. Officially, Sir Robin has been under instructions from the prime minister to ensure that the inquiry has full support from witnesses and is provided with all the documentation it needs. But from the outset Whitehall has been extremely nervous about the inquiry. Whitehall insiders say Sir Robin was less than pleased by the judge's decision at the start of the inquiry to publish an exchange of letters. This showed Sir Robin attempting to curb the inquiry's powers and to ensure that the government reserved a right of veto on what the judge eventually published. Sir Robin lost that battle, but that has not stopped him from picking up on the disquiet shared by those of his troops who have been grilled by the judge in a manner they are not accustomed to. Those close to Sir Robin say he sees his role today primarily as raising morale in Whitehall, as well as calming public unease over the role of officials and ministers as revealed so far by the Scott hearings. In evidence to the Commons Treasury and civil service committee just over a year ago. Sir Robin rejected the suggestion that standards of the civil service had declined in recent years. Questioned about Matrix Churchill, he told the committee: 'In the particular cases you have mentioned, I don't believe that they add up to a very conclusive body of evidence that anything is going wrong.' Lord Justice Scott and his counsel Ms Presiley Baxendale QC have yet to be so convinced. Lady Thatcher told the inquiry in December that 'distribution of intelligence within government and the machinery for ensuring that those who need to know have speedy access to relevant information are matters which the inquiry may consider should be followed up with the cabinet secretary. 'Either the machinery was there and was not effective . . . or else the machinery itself was defective.' Mr John Major told the inquiry that while ministers were responsible for the acts of civil servants, they were not accountable for action by their officials of 'which the minister disapproves and has no prior knowledge'. To the extent that the cabinet secretary co-ordinated the functioning of the government machinery, including the circulation of Whitehall information throughout the arms-for-Iraq affair, the buck stops with Sir Robin. Judging by the line of questioning pursued by the inquiry team in recent weeks, Sir Robin may be asked whether responsibility lies beyond him, and if so with whom.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] President Ange Felix Patasse returned to Bangui  this afternoon after taking part in the 29th summit of heads of  state of the Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa  [UDEAC], held from 15 to 16 March in Ndjamena, Chad. Several  personalities, in particular Prime Minister Jean-Luc Mandaba,  the speaker of the National Assembly, members of the government  and the presidential staff went to welcome him at Bangui  airport. [passage omitted]    Soon after his arrival at the Palais de la Renaissance, the  president reviewed the Ndjamena summit. He recalled the signing  of the treaty and agreements establishing the Economic and  Monetary Community of Central African States [CEMAC], the  Monetary Union of Central Africa, and the Economic Union of  Central Africa. The quality of discussions held by the UDEAC  heads of state was very much appreciated. In fact, they did not  merely content themselves with approving the reports drawn up by  experts and ministers. On the contrary, they carried out a  detailed examination of the documents submitted to them. The  issues discussed at the summit consisted of economic and  regional integration, the situation of the Bank of Central  African States, and a report on the opening up of the region,  presented by the Central African Republic.    President Ange Felix Patasse also appealed for  reconciliation  between the Chadian Government and Moise Kette's movement  operating in southern Chad, the National Awakening Committee for  Peace and Democracy. Alain-George Ngatoua has given us a full  report on President Patasse's Ndjamena trip:    [Begin Patasse recording] I would like to tell you how happy  I feel to be among you this 17 March, for, within days, we will  be marking the anniversary of the tragic death of President  Barthelemy Boganda. In Ndjamena, we contributed much to the  success of the UDEAC summit. We have remained faithful to its  spirit and I am happy to announce that at long last Central  Africa is coming out of its deep slumber. We have understood  that our destinies are linked together. Central Africa is  lagging far behind the others because of national chauvinism.  At the same time that we held our summit in Ndjamena, West  Africa was also holding its summit. While all the West African  heads of state were present at their summit, some leaders in our  subregion were absent. You will understand the anguish we felt  some time ago. So if we left Bangui for Ndjamena, it was not  simply to accept the UDEAC secretary general's report, but  because we wanted to breathe new life into this institution by  taking a decisive step.    It was a choice between continuing to tread the same  well-trodden paths or to carry out a radical restructuring. We  opted for the latter solution. Yes, Central Africa is coming  out of its long sleep and those who want to remain within this  general dymamic awakening movement will do so, but those who do  not want to do so -- and it is a question of state sovereignty  -- are free not to go along with the others.    As far as we are concerned, we have stated that the treaty  establishing the economic and monetary community in Central  Africa must be signed at all costs. We have also said that it  was not obligatory to sign the treaty on the same day and at the  same place. Each country can do so within the framework of its  peculiar institutions. On this score, the host country  submitted the draft treaty for signature. Chad, Congo, and the  Central African Republic have signed the treaty. The president  of Equatorial Guinea could not be present at Ndjamena and  delegated this responsiblity to his deputy prime minister, so  Equatorial Guinea has also signed. Cameroon sent only the  president of its Economic and Social Council, who did not even  have a mandate to initial the document. However, since the  current chairmanship of the UDEAC has fallen to Cameroon, the  ball is in that country's court. We have decided to walk hand  in hand, and that is the determining factor. The community has  been born. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

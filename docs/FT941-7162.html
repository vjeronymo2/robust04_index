			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Volatile trading seen on the continent The bond markets again had a heavy influence on trading yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. Merill Lynch has dropped its exposure to lower interest rates as a major strategy theme. 'The lack of a positive response to last week's rate cut (in Germany) adds weight to the view that rates are falling but everybody now expects it. We have reduced weightings in France and Spain and increased weightings in the UK, the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway'. FRANKFURT retreated after Wednesday's gains with the futures market again providing most of the impetus to the day's activity. The Dax index tumbled 37.38 or 1.7 per cent to 2,090.20 and the March Dax contract by 65.5 to 2,083.0. In the after market the Ibis indicated index lost 57.4 to 2,082.89. The market seemed unmoved by inflation data from the state of Hesse which came in much within expectations. Among individual issues, Man, which announced a fall in six-month group sales of 7.9 per cent and an increase in orders of 16 per cent slipped DM5 to DM420. Bilfinger &amp; Berger, the construction company, followed the broader market lower, losing DM8 to DM930, in spite of reporting that it expected to pay a dividend on 1993 results. ZURICH tumbled 2.3 per cent, as it registered disappointment at results from SMH, the watchmaker, which had climbed strongly in the previous two sessions, and worries over the earnings outlook at Nestle. The SMI index fell 69.1 to 2,958.4, amid selling by foreign investors taking advantage of the strong franc. Results this morning from UBS are seen as crucial to setting the market's direction in coming days. SMH registered fell SFr18 or 8.3 per cent to SFr198 in response to news, after the market closed on Wednesday, that 1993 group net profit rose by a smaller than expected 7 per cent. The day's fall more than wiped out the rises of the previous two sessions on news that Mercedes Benz was to co-operate in the development of the Swatchmobile. Nestle shed SFr53 or 3.9 per cent to SFr1,296 after some analysts revised down their e/ps forecasts. Remarks by the company at a food conference in Arizona that it did not plan a share listing in the US for the time being also prompted some US sales. UBS shed SFr21 to SFr1,451, giving up some of recent rises, as analysts suggested that anything less that a 60 per cent rise in 1993 profits would prove a big disappointment to the market. PARIS reacted negatively to news of the Bank of France's 10 basis point cut in the intervention rate to 6.10 per cent, and then fell below the 2,200 level, before rising by the close. The CAC-40 index, which had seen a day's low of 2,178.24 closed off 43.71 or 1.9 per cent at 2,208.29. Pechiney, which said that it was to cut aluminium output in Europe by 87,000 tonnes, lost FFr2.50 to FFr439.50. Metaleurop, a division of Preussag of Germany, which saw a doubling of its losses in the 1992/93 period to end of September held steady at FFr89.50. The company commented that the worst might now be over. AMSTERDAM suffered from disappointing results from Royal Dutch which left the stock down Fl 5.70 at Fl 202.70. This left the AEX index off 7.50 or 1.7 per cent at 418.31. Unilever continued to be depressed by its poor results earlier in the week, the stock falling another Fl 6.00 to Fl 213.50, while Akzo softened Fl 7.50 to Fl 207.50 ahead of results expected out today. Grolsch, the brewer, was, with Heineken, among the few stocks to go against the market, the former rising Fl 2.30 or 5.4 per cent to Fl 44.50 and the latter Fl 1.00 to Fl 229.50. Grolsch has signed an agreement with UK brewer Bass to produce and distribute its product in the UK. MILAN continued on its downward path, swept along by the wave of selling elsewhere in Europe and with the forthcoming elections proving a further disincentive. The Comit index shed 14.06 or 2.1 per cent to 655.66. BCI bucked the trend, picking up L137 or 2.4 per cent to L5,873, after its falls in recent sessions. Actinvest, an independent research group, expected the privatisation price, to be set tomorrow, to be around L5,000. MADRID fell 1.6 per cent, depressed by weak bonds, and the general index shed 5.56 to 337.29.

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / German inflation falls to 3.2%: Economic watch Inflation in Germany has fallen to its lowest level since May 1991, according to preliminary data released by the federal statistics office showing a monthly increase of 0.2 per cent for March. Inflation in the 12 months to March was 3.2 per cent, a drop of 0.2 percentage points compared with the rate in the 12 months to February. The preliminary figure is based on results from the four most populous Lander. Final figures are not expected until mid-April. The March increase is in line with forecasts of falling inflation and comes two weeks after Mr Hans Tietmayer, the Bundesbank president, said inflation was set to fall below 2 per cent in the long term. The government has forecast inflation of about 3 per cent for 1994. Analysts said the March rise was mainly caused by increased taxes on fuel, although the higher cost of rents and services also contributed to the rise.</p>

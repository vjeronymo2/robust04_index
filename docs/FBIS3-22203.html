			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First  Channel Network in Russian at 0840 GMT on 19 February broadcasts  an ecological program ``People's Earth,'' which carries a  10-minute feature on the continuing investigation into the  sinking of the Komsomolets nuclear submarine on 7 April 1989 in  the Norwegian Sea near Medvezhiy island. Video shows nuclear  submarine in Arctic waters, investigating expedition with  underwater apparatus, clips and stills of Komsomolets on the  seabed, interviews with officials    ``The Komsomolets is not the first nuclear submarine to  suffer an accident but it is the first whose nuclear reactor has  leaked.''    However, as has become known, thanks to research carried out  by Russian shore-based scientists, the reactor does not pose a  serious ecological threat. The aim of the latest expedition by  the Committee for Conducting Special Purpose Submarine Work  [KOPRON] -- which has kindly given our program exclusive rights  to show its video material -- was to assess the situation  concerning the warheads. If plutonium escapes into the sea it  could cause serious ecological danger.    ``The latest data from the chemical analysis taken from  around the plutonium warheads is not comforting. KOPRON is  being disbanded and so are the mobile structures carrying out  active preparations for the conservation of warheads on the  Komsomolets.''</p>

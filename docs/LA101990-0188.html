			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> HUMPHREY'S ANKLE INJURY BETTER  </P> <P> Bobby Humphrey's sprained right ankle was improved, but he remained listed as  questionable on the Denver Broncos' injury report for Sunday's game at  Indianapolis and a final decision on his status might not be made until just  prior to kickoff.  </P> <P> Humphrey, the NFL rushing leader, practiced Thursday, and was able to cut on  the artificial turf in the team's indoor practice facility.  </P> <P> "It's a lot better than it was," said Humphrey, who missed last week's game.  "If it gets better than what it is, I think there's a good chance I will play.  But you just can't tell with ankle injuries."  </P></p>

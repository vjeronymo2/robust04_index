			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: French retail group plans Cofinoga sale GALERIES Lafayette, the French retailing group, plans to sell a 49 per cent stake in Cofinoga, its credit and charge card business, to the Cetelem group. The news of the proposed disposal comes shortly after Galeries Lafayette warned of a poor performance in 1992 due to the cost of servicing the debt on its FFr2.9bn (Dollars 537m) bid for the Nouvelles Galeries retail chain and the need to make steep provisions on its flagship store in New York. Galeries Lafayette has confirmed that it stayed in the black in 1992 but will only release specific profit figures when its full results are published later this month. Credit Lyonnais, the French state-controlled banking group, is to increase its holding in Banque Franco-Hellenique de Commerce International et Maritime (BFH), an Athens-based bank, to 75 per cent by acquiring a 25 per cent stake, writes Kerin Hope in Athens. The French bank has agreed to buy the 25 per cent of BFH from the state-owned National Investment Bank for Industrial Development (Eteva) for an undisclosed sum. Eteva will retain the remaining 25 per cent. Under the terms of the agreement, BFH, with a net worth of about Dr7bn (Dollars 32m), will be expected to seek a listing on the Athens stock exchange within three years.</p>

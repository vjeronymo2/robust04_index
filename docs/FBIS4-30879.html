			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Istvan Schlett: "Migrating Voters -- Who </F> Decided and on What?"]    [Text] As I write this article, it cannot yet be known  what the results of the coalition talks between the Hungarian  Socialist Party [MSZP] and the Alliance of Free Democrats  [SZDSZ] will be -- we might have to wait days for this.  However, it is certain that a government change will take  place: The hitherto determining government party will go into  opposition and the MSZP, which has so far been in opposition  will come to government -- alone or with a coalition partner.    "What happened here?" Analysts and politicians are asking  this and will be doing so for a long time. Although --  presumably -- the majority of society is more interested in the  question "what will happen," it is not at all insignificant to  give a correct answer to the first question. The practical  answer to the second question depends to a large extent on  whether the politicians -- winners and losers alike -- draw the  right conclusions from the final results of the elections.    In my view, it is a big mistake to say that the "people" --  although it is probably more precise to say that the majority of  electors -- made its decision in an ideological war, namely that  it chose the left wing or socialism, perhaps liberalism, as  opposed to the right wing, the national group, conservatism, or  Christianity. At most, half of the electors can be characterized  by these ideological definitions. With suitable generosity, the  30 percent who voted for the losers can be listed among these,  and some 10 percent each from the camps of the winners, people  who supported their parties even in bad times.    However, the change of government was decided by the other  50  percent. They decided it in such a way that they did not  concurrently become socialists or left-wing liberals, rather,  they had simply had enough of the failures -- or what was seen  as such -- of the government, the deteriorating living standards  -- or what was perceived as such -- and politicians spending  their time on debates that are uninteresting for them. These  citizens were not interested in either rational or emotional  explanations: reference to the "forty years" or the past in the  reprisal forces, the national or the Christian slogans.    Is this due to the people being wise, as it is said by those  who, even months ago, scared people with the right-wing  extremists' coming to power, assuming that it is possible to  deceive them with national demagogy, anti-Semitism, and other  wild ideas. Or is it because they are stupid, stupefied, and  can be misled, as is resentfully believed by some of the current  losers who used to be talk loudly about the people's wisdom.    I very much doubt that the "people" are able to change their  character and abilities so quickly. Something else must be the  reason.    I suspect practical considerations behind the decision. The  past four years have not met their expectations. However, if I  think about the results of public opinion polls, I can also say  that at least one side of their decision was made in the few  months following the change of the regime. However, at that  time -- let us remember -- their wishes were projected into the  Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz]. It is a different  matter why this party did not manage to keep its sympathizers  and why they have moved on, searching for an alternative to the  government -- it is the Fidesz that will first have to find the  answer to this.    What is important for me now is that about half of the  electors did not choose between the alternative world views or  the political alternatives, they did not join any political  camps. Whether this is wise or stupid behavior, it should be  discussed by the politicians and intellectuals divided according  to trends -- or I could say, the camps. However, politicians --  if they wish to be successful -- have to face facts whether they  are winners or losers. The reason is that it is not certain that  the migration has ended: It is possible that it will very soon  -- perhaps again within months -- be restarted.    This is the nature of practical decisions linked to  situations. Precisely because ideological or value affiliations  play little role in these decisions, they are not linked to  traditions and not even to personal trust in the leaders chosen  by the people themselves. The correctness of the decision is  measured by the results: If they do not prove forthcoming then  the decision can be changed without hesitation.    Therefore, it would be a mistake to believe that the  electors  have finally or at least lastingly found their places in the  political camps. In this sense, the process of the development  of party affiliations has not ended. Therefore, the most we can  say is that the parties that see themselves on the left have won  because the electors voted on them, but it would be very risky  to say that these electors are on the left. It is not at all  certain that the future governmental activities determined by  the goals and scope of the winning party (or parties) coincide  with the desires of the "migrating voters," and if they do not,  whether this party (or parties) can bind these people to  themselves. It is possible -- in fact, likely -- that even if  these people do place themselves on the right to left or  socialist-liberal to conservative scale, or on any ideological  or world view scale, then this is not identical with the notions  the parties themselves have.    Naturally, we have no reason to assume that the process of  developing party affiliations will not progress -- after all,  about half of the electors have managed to find their places in  four years and they are indeed linked to various parties on the  basis of interests, sentiments, trust, and even values, and not  only promises. It would be more difficult for them to change  their affiliations, the spectacular success or failure of their  parties would be needed for their "enlightenment" on the road to  Damascus. Their number might even increase. However, it is  difficult to imagine that ideological motives would be needed  for the majority of the very practically thinking 50 percent to  do this. Another version seems to be more credible: If  experience justifies their choice, then confidence is formed,  and binding to the party, its value system, and ideology also  emerge. And then traditions, political families, and stable  voting camps are also formed.    If I am correct then this has only happened to a certain  extent up to now. The new government and the politicians who  come to power will have to be aware of this. What kind of  decisions they make in the knowledge of this is precisely where  their great responsibility lies. Decisions whose single aim is  to keep the mass support -- which might cost the country dearly  -- or decisions that are demanded by the country's best interest  according to the circumstances, their best abilities, and  conscience. Now, to be consciously naive, I add that the  opposition also has a responsibility. It might happen in such a  way that it would be very easy to take revenge. However, they  will have to assess the value and cost of things.    I do not believe that a new era is beginning with the change  of government. However, when something new begins, optimism is  compulsory. Therefore, I hope that the majority of our  politicians have learned something from the experience of the  past four years -- wherever they were or will be in parliament  -- and at least they will not make the same mistakes too often.</p>

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Hotfoot it down to the Pounds 85m airport mall - A look at BAA's plan to earn more from retailing than airport charges BAA, the former British Airports Authority, is gradually transforming itself into a giant shopping emporium. Sir John Egan, chief executive, sees in retailing one of the most promising growth opportunities for his company's airports. About Pounds 85m has already been earmarked for retail expansion at BAA airports over the next four years. And although traditional airport operations including take-off and landing fees and other airline related charges now make the biggest single contribution to BAA revenues, Sir John expects retailing to grow steadily in importance. 'By 1993-94 BAA will earn more from retailing operations than from actual aeronautical charges,' he forecast. Aeronautical charges last year accounted for Pounds 363.2m of BAA's total Pounds 909.3m revenues, whereas income from commercial operations amounted to Pounds 277m. This included Pounds 137.7m from duty and tax free shops and an additional Pounds 25.2m from book stores and other specialist airport shops as well as income from a host of other commercial services. During the last eight months, BAA has opened 27 new retailing outlets at its airports and by the end of this year the total is expected to rise to 90 new outlets. 'By 1996, we will have increased floorspace by over 400,000 sq ft at our airports, virtually double the 1991 level.' Intensive market research by BAA and airlines indicates that passengers like to shop at airports, said Sir John. 'This is borne out by the fact that even during the recession when high street retailers felt the pinch, we were able to increase the spend per passenger.' Shoes are one of the consumer items in biggest demand at BAA airports. The Bally shoe shop in Heathrow's Terminal 3 will achieve a turnover of more than Pounds 3m this year, selling more per sq ft than any other shoe store in the UK. BAA sees significant opportunities for further growth in retail sales at its airports not only from new passengers but also from existing users who currently do not buy at airport shops: only 32 per cent of the 72m passengers who used BAA airports last year shopped at BAA stores. Sir John also believes his company can substantially increase the current Pounds 6 average spend per passenger at its airports. Higher income from retailing operations will help to offset expected reductions in traditional aeronautical charges as a result of the Civil Aviation Authority's new pricing regime governing traffic charges at BAA's London area airports. The new five year regime limits BAA London airport traffic charges - which include those levied at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted - on a formula of retail price inflation (RPI) minus eight for both this year and next year, RPI minus four the following year and RPI minus one for the two subsequent years. Sir John said the formula would lead to a reduction in income from airport charges of Pounds 25m this year rising to Pounds 50m next year. This would also make the charges at BAA airports among the lowest in the world - and they are already at the bottom end of the European league, according to an annual review of charges at 40 leading international airports published yesterday. The study, prepared by the Travers Morgan Consulting group, shows that the five most expensive airports in terms of aeronautical charges are three in Germany (Berlin, Frankfurt and Munich), Tokyo and Vancouver. Heathrow and Gatwick featured in the lower half of the index, coming in at 21 and 27 respectively.</p>

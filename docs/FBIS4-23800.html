			<p>BFN     [Text] Early reports on the movement of public transport  indicate that workers in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand,  Vereeniging] Province and in the Durban area are not staying  away on a large scale to celebrate 16 June. Buses and trains  are running normally and carrying the normal number of  passengers. The government decided yesterday not to declare  today an official public holiday despite trade union insistence.  The South African Chamber of Business welcomed the announcement  but asked that the employers be flexible towards workers wanting  the day off.</p>

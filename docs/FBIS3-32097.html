Senator Bernard  Sansaricque acts as spokesman for this faction of the Senate,  which is composed of legislators from the Alliance for  Parliamentary Cohesion and those elected during the contested 18  January elections. Bernard Sansaricque also supports the  formation of a new office in the Senate to expedite a solution  to the crisis, considering that the current office has thus far  worked to block the institutions:    [Begin recording in Creole] [Sansaricque] Between 10 August  and the present, Firmin Jean-Louis held two sessions in the  Senate. He cannot blame that on the 18 January senators. They  all respected the New York pact until 11 January. So he cannot  blame anyone but himself. I think he was a senator with a  well-defined mission, the mission of obstructing the country,  blocking the Senate of the Republic, because one cannot be a  president of the Senate -- in addition to his regular salary, he  is earning an additional $1,500 a month. He just obstructs  progress. He travels to see Aristide abroad while the country is  collapsing.    It is therefore a situation that must be solved quickly in  the Senate of the Republic. There is an ad hoc office, led by  Sen. Ebrane, working right now to find a solution to unite the  Senate and solve the problem that the country is facing.    [Reporter Renois] Bernard Sansaricque, when you say unite  the  Senate, do you mean to unite it with the legislators who were  elected during the 18 January elections, which are still being  contested?    [Sansaricque] They are contested. However, even the UN and  the OAS recognized them, since they asked them: Will the  legislators elected on 18 January please remain outside. Those  legislators remained outside the crisis until the New York pact  was no longer valid for them, at which time they returned to  parliament. They kept their word.    [Renois] Does the New York pact officially exist today? Are  we still under the New York pact in parliament?    [Sansaricque] Certainly some senators will tell you that the  New York pact exists. If you ask me, the New York Pact never  existed and still does not exist.    [Renois] Another aspect in the Senate question: I read in  the  December issue of JEUNE AFRIQUE, an African magazine, that some  senators, namely Thomas Eddy Dupiton, was involved in the  assassination of Antoine Izmery. Has the Senate considered this  case?    [Sansaricque] Of course we are studying this file. I just  brought the letter that we wrote to Colin Granderson to Radio  Metropole to let it be known that there really is a UN/OAS file  on the Izmery case which involves Sen. Dupiton. The Senate will  want to have it for necessary purposes. If there is a file, they  must present it. A magazine, JEUNE AFRIQUE, or any other  magazine cannot just accuse senators...    [Renois] Did JEUNE AFRIQUE quote the UN report on that  matter?    [Sansaricque] They spoke of the UN report which they say was  given to the U.S. intelligence service. For such a serious  matter, the Senate of the Republic should study this file. The  UN and the OAS should therefore give it to us for our own use.    [Renois] Last question, Sen. Bernard Sansaricque: There is a  crisis. How and when do you, as a senator of the Republic, see  this crisis being solved?    [Sansaricque] I see that the crisis can be solved as soon as  the Senate has a serious office. The senator named Firmin  Jean-Louis, who was appointed by Caputo and applauded by some  senators, and who had the defined mission of blocking the Senate  of the Republic, blocking the country as a whole and making the  people suffer as they are now suffering, must be stopped. We  must have a decent office, a working office that respects the  mandate granted to us. [end recording]</p>

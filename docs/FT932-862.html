			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Videos tackle cash-card mystery EXPERIMENTS using video cameras in banks' cash dispensers have failed to find evidence that 'phantom withdrawals', where funds vanish from a cardholder's account without their knowledge or permission, are caused by faulty technology. In every case tested, the cameras pictured the cardholder or a close acquaintance withdrawing the money. This week a judge cleared the way for a mass legal action against banks and building societies by customers claiming to have lost money through phantom withdrawals. Banks and building societies  - including Bank of Scotland, Barclays Bank, Midland Bank and Derbyshire Building Society  - are experimenting with video systems to counter accusations that errors in cash dispensers or main computer systems are responsible for the mystery withdrawals. The banks have consistently denied that their technology could be at fault in spite of instances of cash machines breaking down. Bank of Scotland has been testing videocameras in some of its 390 machines over the past year. There was a small but significant number of 'phantom withdrawals', but in no case was the technology found to be at fault. In each case the withdrawal had been made by a forgetful cardholder, or by a member of the cardholder's family or a family acquaintance without the cardholder's permission. Tests by Derbyshire Building Society showed similar results. Cameras are not likely to become widespread. Video capability adds some Pounds 1,500 to the cost of a cash dispenser and there are some 18,000 in the UK, suggesting a bill for the banks of Pounds 27m. Cash dispenser fraud costs only about Pounds 3m annually. Ghosts in the machines, Page 8</p>

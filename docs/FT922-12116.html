			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / The Lex Column: The medicine goes down Yesterday's further downward lurch in UK drug stocks confirms that the sector's extraordinary three-year bull market has come to an end. This partly results from a fresh bout of nerves about drug pricing. But more important is another familiar theme: the shift from defensive stocks into cyclicals. This might be thought a bullish sign for the UK market as a whole. Sadly, it is not that simple. The driving force for the UK drug sector is the US investment community, which owns a quarter of Glaxo and a third of SmithKline Beecham. Those volatile and uncommitted holders drove UK drug stocks up last year when they decided domestic stocks like Merck were high enough. That they are now turning away from the sector, just as they did when the US bull market kicked off 10 years ago, may be good news for Wall Street. The implications for the UK market are purely secondary. It is also evidence of US influence that drug pricing should have re-emerged as a source of worry at all. For several years, drug prices in most of the world have been flat even in nominal terms. In Japan they have actually fallen. Only in the US, the world's largest and most lucrative drug market - from which Glaxo, for instance, derives a third of its profits - have prices held up. Recent menacing noises from the US government about healthcare costs have upset US investors accordingly. They should have come as little surprise to anyone else. In share price terms, the results of all this have been fairly dramatic. The S&amp;P drugs sector peaked relative to the US market on January 13 this year. SmithKline Beecham and Glaxo peaked relative to the FT-SE on the same day, and have since underperformed by 17 per cent and 23 per cent respectively. The exception is Wellcome, which has underperformed by only 7 per cent. But Wellcome is unusual in that only some 2 per cent of its shares are held in the US. The success of its forthcoming share sale will largely depend on how far that can be changed. The climate scarcely looks propitious.</p>

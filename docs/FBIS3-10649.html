IBEP asked  which candidate the deputies and senators believe has the best  chance of winning the elections, irrespective of their personal  or party preferences. The conclusion turned into an  embarrassing situation for PT [Workers Party] candidate Luis  Inacio Lula da Silva, who is leading the street polls. One  fifth of the entire Congress chose Lula as the candidate "with  the best chance of being elected president," but only half of  his party bloc chose him as Itamar Franco's successor.    Protected by the IBEP's commitment that full secrecy would  be  guaranteed, the PT bloc had two unexpected choices: 16.7 percent  of PT bloc members considered that PMDB [Brazilian Democratic  Movement Party] leader Antonio Brito has a better chance than  Lula. They also voted for Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos  Magalhaes, of the PFL [Liberal Front Party] (8.3 percent); Sao  Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf, of the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party]  (8.3 percent); and Senator Mario Covas, PSDB [Brazilian Social  Democracy Party] Sao Paulo state, (8.3 percent).    Lula gathered votes from almost all other parties: 30  percent  from PDT legislators; 20 percent from the PPR; 18.6 percent from  the PMDB; 18.2 percent from the PP [Popular Party]; and 15.3  percent from the PFL. After Lula, the legislators chose the  following candidates as having the best chance: Antonio Brito  (16 percent); Paulo Maluf (11.2 percent); Antonio Carlos  Magalhaes (7.8 percent); and Finance Minister Fernando Henrique  Cardoso of the PSDB (6.39 percent). The legislators belive the  candidates with the least chances are Orestes Quercia of the  PMDB (who only obtained 1.5 percent of legislators' votes), and  Rio de Janeiro Governor Leonoel Brizola of the PDT [Democratic  Labor Party] (3.3 perent). Quercia and Brizola shared one thing  in common; they were only chosen by members of their own party  blocs.    Political Scientist Walder de Goes, the IBEP poll  supervisor,  said: "Legislators have always been like a measuring stick in an  election year, and these results are more revealing than current  street polls." Walder said the pollsters clearly explained what  was required in the questionnaires: It was specified that this  was not a question of personal preference, but of who they  consider has the best chance of being elected president.    After explaining that the IBEP methodology has a margin of  error that is less than 1 percent, Walder said: "We were shocked  by the results of the poll, mainly with the lack of unity within  the PT regarding Lula."    The poll was conducted on 2-10 Febraury among a sample of  Brazilian legislators -- 104 deputies (20 percent of the Chamber  of Deputies) and 25 Senators (30 percent of the Senate) -- was  stratified on parties and regions encompassing five geographical  regions and those party blocs represented in Congress on a  proportional basis in the two houses. The polled legislators  were drawn at random and the results were burned after being  tabulated.    The poll reveals that presidential candidates continue to  carry the votes for the rest of the ticket. The majority of  legislators (53.5 percercent) believe that the presidential  candidate determines the choice of the voters while 15 percent  believe the candidates for governors decide. Some 24.3 pecent  believe both have an equal influence on voters. The majority of  legislators believe the mixed district vote is the best  electoral system for the country; 62.2 percent of deputies and  senators support this system as opposed 31.5 percent who support  the system currently in force.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;When the basis for imposing a civil money penalty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exists, the administrative law judge or State hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officer may not set a penalty of zero, reduce the penalty to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> zero, or review the exercise of discretion to impose the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> civil money penalty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;In the case of civil money penalties, facilities may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> challenge the level of noncompliance found by HCFA or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State if a successful challenge on the issue would affect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the range of civil money penalty amounts from which HCFA or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State could collect a civil money penalty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We add a provision to direct the State during a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complaint investigation to follow the specific procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found at &sect;488.335 (&sect;488.185 of the proposed rule), action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on complaints of resident neglect and abuse, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misappropriation of resident property, when there is reason  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to believe that an identifiable individual neglected or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abused a resident or misappropriated a resident's property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We add a requirement that the State must have written  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures for the timely review and investigation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allegations of resident neglect and abuse and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misappropriation of resident property. In addition, we have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required that the State should take appropriate precautions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to protect a complainant's anonymity and privacy, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;If arrangements have been made with other State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components for investigation of complaints, we require that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State have a means of communicating information among  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate entities, and that the survey agency retain the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility for the investigation process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We require that findings of investigations be included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the nurse aide registry within 10 working days of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> findings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We require that the survey agency determine if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complaints violate any requirements of part 483, subpart B  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and take appropriate enforcement action as necessary if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allegation of neglect, abuse or misappropriation of property  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against an individual is a complaint against the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We require the notification of physicians of those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents identified as receiving substandard quality of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We clarify that survey findings are reported with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendations for corrective action to officials in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcing agency who determine what remedies to impose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;With respect to the disclosure of survey information,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we revise the provisions on fees, charges, and timeframes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for release of information to provide that, with certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceptions, HCFA or the State will disclose survey-related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information and may charge the public in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pre-existing Federal regulations and State procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We eliminate 120 days of FFP for a Medicaid NF and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retain, for now, 120 days of FFP for an ICF/MR while the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility waits for a post-termination hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We formalize the opportunity for informal dispute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolution currently in the State Operations Manual for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providers to raise unresolved issues to the State agency or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the respective HCFA regional office after the provider's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receipt of the official deficiency statement, and have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibited challenges by providers from postponing or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise delaying the effective date of any enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We specify that a provider in substantial compliance at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the end of 6 months may continue to participate without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repayment of Federal funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We delete the section on validation surveys from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation text because the statutory provisions are self-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementing and regulatory interpretation is not needed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarify them. The few elaborations on the requirements in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections 1819(g)(3) and 1919(g)(3) of the Act are duplicated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elsewhere in the regulation and there is little reason to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repeat them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dear friends: Mrs. Ho The Lan, spokeswoman for the  Vietnamese Foreign Ministry, held a regular news conference in  Hanoi this afternoon with a large number of local and foreign  correspondents in attendance.    The REUTER, AP, ABC, NIKKEI, and YOMIURI SHIMBUN  correspondents raised questions about the timing, venue, and  level of the forthcoming Vietnamese-U.S. talks on the issue of  financial claims and about any other issues that will be  discussed at these talks. The REUTER correspondent asked another  question about the reason for the postponement of the talks on  financial claims and about when the two sides would discuss the  opening of liaison offices. In reply, Mrs. Ho The Lan said:    It is true that Vietnam and the United States had initially  planned to discuss mutual financial claims on 15-16 February.  But as Mr. Le Mai clearly stated at his 4 February news  conference, with President Bill Clinton's declaration lifting  the embargo against Vietnam, and with his proposal to exchange  liaison offices between the two countries, new issues have  arisen that need to be discussed by both sides. The talks must  therefore be postponed for some time to allow for better  preparation. The issue of financial claims and the setting up  of liaison offices in Hanoi and Washington will certainly be  included on the agenda of the upcoming talks. We have thus far  only agreed that Hanoi will be the venue for the talks. I will  inform you of the timing when an agreement is reached.    To a question raised by the REUTER and AP correspondents  about when Vietnam and the United States will begin their talks  on human rights, Mrs. Ho The Lan said:    Vietnam advocates holding dialogues with all countries,  including the United States, on matters of mutual concern,  including the human rights issue. As for how much progress has  been made in connection with the dialogue on human rights, we  have reached a general understanding that such a dialogue will  be an exchange of views based of equality, mutual respect, and  noninterference in each other's internal affairs. It is on this  basis that Vietnam and the United States have agreed to meet to  discuss matters of mutual concern, including the human rights  issue -- in the near future in New York or Washington -- to  understand each other's positions better. By the way, I would  like to reassert it is Vietnam's policy to attach importance to  relations with the United States and to wish for normal  relations between the two countries on the basis of respect for  each other's independence and sovereignty, noninterference in  each other's internal affairs, equality, and mutual benefit.  During their previous talks, both the United States and Vietnam  came to understand that the goodwill and efforts of both sides  will determine whether or not obstacles arise in the path of  normalized relations between the two countries. The two sides  also unanimously held that no political conditions should be  attached to the normalization of relations between Vietnam and  the United States.    The BANGKOK POST correspondent asked whether Vietnam saw any  prospects for differences over the Spratly and Paracel  archipelagoes being settled through preventive diplomacy, in  view of the 16 February Bangkok seminar on preventive diplomacy  held between the ASEAN countries and their interlocutors with UN  participation. Mrs. Ho The Lan said:    The Paracel and Spratly archipelagoes are under Vietnamese  sovereignty. We advocate settling all disputes through peaceful  negotiations. This conforms to the general trend of the  countries in the region. We believe that all differences can be  settled through negotiation and diplomacy.    The QUAN DOI NHAN DAN correspondent said that according to  the Chinese press and Radio Australia, China has sent two  research ships to the Spratly archipelago to explore for oil.  The correspondent asked if the Vietnamese side had any comment  on this. Mrs. Ho The Lan said:    Time and again, we have affirmed that the Spratly and  Paracel  archipelagoes are Vietnamese territory. Any foreign oil  exploration in the Spratly archipelago area or on Vietnam's  continental shelf without Vietnam's permission or approval  amounts to a violation of Vietnam's sovereignty and other  rights. This incident is at variance with an agreement reached  between the two countries that both sides should refrain from  doing anything that may further complicate the situation while  they conduct negotiations to settle problems in the Eastern Sea.    Answering a question from the ITAR-TASS correspondent  regarding Vietnam's observation of the results of the Geneva  conference on Indochinese refugees, Mrs. Ho The Lan said:    We have expressed our stance on several occasions regarding  the repatriation of Vietnamese refugees still stranded in  first-asylum countries. I would like to reiterate that the  Vietnamese Government is ready to hold talks with all parties  concerned to take back refugees whose applications for  resettlement in third countries are turned down. Such  repatriation must be carried out on the basis of willingness;  respect for human dignity; and guarantees of safety,  orderliness, and the necessary international financial  assistance so that returnees can gradually stabilize their lives  after returning to Vietnam. In this spirit, we have been  cooperating and are currently cooperating effectively with the  High Commissioner for Refugees and other parties concerned to  help complete the repatriation program by the end of 1995.    Asked by the ITAR-TASS correspondent about Vietnam's  reaction  to the possible NATO bombing of Sarajevo in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  Mrs. Ho The Lan said:    We hope that the Sarajevo issue will be settled through  peaceful negotiations among the warring factions. We do not  believe that bombing will bring peace to that country or  stability to the Balkan region.    [Hanoi VNA in English at 1445 GMT on 17 February in a  similar  report adds: "On news about whether Japanese Prime Minister  Hosokawa would visit Vietnam, Mrs Lan said: Vietnam has not  received such news through official channel. However if the  Japanese prime minister plans to visit this year, he is welcome  and Vietnam considers it an important event in the development  of the friendship and cooperation between the two countries.  Mrs Lan rejected the news that Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet was  going to visit Indonesia and to meet with Taiwan's president in  Bali."]</p>

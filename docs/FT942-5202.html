			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Observer: Ex-diplomats Former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger has never taken kindly to criticism. Now that it is coming via a dead man he is becoming quite apoplectic. The object of his ire, expressed in letters to the New York Times and Wall Street Journal last Friday, is H R Haldeman, whose posthumously published diaries of President Nixon's first term are as riveting a read as those of Alan Clark, despite the lack of sex. It is not so much Haldeman's revelations about linking US withdrawal from Vietnam to the US electoral timetable which upset the elder statesman. It is the presumption that Nixon dared to discuss vital policy with Haldeman, his chief of staff, rather than Kissinger, the national security adviser. 'Nixon was just blowing off steam rather than changing strategy for Haldeman was concerned with public relations, not substance, and any change in strategy would have been discussed with me,' says Kissinger. The problem is that there is a lot more in the Haldeman diaries about 'K' than Vietnam strategy, such as his bitter rivalry with Bill Rogers, then secretary of state, who is still alive. The letters columns threaten to be compelling reading in the weeks ahead.</p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Finnish territorial water move Finland intends to extend its territorial waters to 12 nautical miles from the present four, the Finnish news agency STT reported yesterday. It said the centre-right government made the decision at a meeting and a proposal would be submitted to parliament before the middle of the year. A corridor of international waters at least six nautical miles wide would remain between Finland and Estonia in the Gulf of Finland that leads to the Russian city of St Petersburg. One reason behind the move is to help Finnish authorities check cross-border traffic to prevent smuggling and other crime. It would also help efforts to protect the marine environment. Neighbouring Sweden extended its waters in 1979 and Estonia decided about a year ago to do the same.</p>

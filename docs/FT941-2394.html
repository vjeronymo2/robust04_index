			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney attendance shows fall in second year Euro Disney, the troubled leisure group that last week agreed terms with its banks for a FFr13bn (Dollars 2.25bn) rescue package, has suffered a sharp fall in attendance over the past year, according to Mr Philippe Bourguignon, chairman. Mr Bourguignon told Journal du Dimanche, the French newspaper, that about 9.5m people will have visited the EuroDisneyland theme park by the end of its second year on April 12, against 10.5m visitors during the first year. One cause of the decline was a reduction in the number of British visitors. The UK was one of EuroDisneyland's largest markets in the first year. However, the pound's weakness against the French franc, following the autumn 1992 currency crisis, triggered a significant fall in British bookings last spring and summer. The pound has since strengthened slightly against the franc. Mr Bourguignon said Euro Disney plans to try to boost attendance from the UK. 'Our priority for this season is to reconquer the British market,' he added. Mr Bourguignon did not disclose details of the company's plans for the UK. However, Euro Disney last year secured a significant increase in attendance from the French through a successful campaign of aggressive advertising and price promotion. Euro Disney last year was also hit by a fall in the number of German visitors. More recently it is understood that advance bookings for the coming spring and summer season have been depressed by uncertainty over the progress of the financial restructuring. 'Understandably, parents were worried about promising their children a trip to Euro-Disneyland only to find that the park had been closed,' said one insider. 'Now that the rescue has been agreed, we ought to see a rush of bookings.' Despite the rescue, Euro Disney is expected to remain in the red this year. Morgan Stanley forecasts a net loss of FFr1.5bn for the present year to September 30 with the company scheduled to break even only in the 1995/96 financial year.</p>

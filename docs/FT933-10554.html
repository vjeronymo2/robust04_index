			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie challenges its closing peak INVESTORS in the UK stock market continued yesterday to take a highly optimistic view of the implications for European and British interest rates from the dramatic developments in the ERM network. At the day's peak the FT-SE 100 Index was within a few points of its previous closing high, and overseas buyers were identified in both equities and stock index futures. The first day of the new equity trading account opened on a confident note. There was slight disappointment, however, that the ERM was not 'finally laid to rest' at the weekend, as one dealer put it. Share gains were almost halved in the second half of the session when a big buyer withdrew from the futures market and Wall Street made a slow start, showing a fall of 12 points on the Dow Average in UK trading hours. Equities also took note of a less aggressive performance in UK government bonds. The final reading left the FT-SE 100 at 2,941.7 for a net gain of 15.2 points. At midsession the Footsie touched 2,954.5, within 3 points of the closing high reached on March 8, although still some way short of a trading peak of 2,980.9, also in March. Although several securities houses upgraded forecasts for the UK market, it was clear at yesterday's morning strategy meetings that many houses were still wrestling with the implications of the new global investment scenario posed by the ERM currency developments. The broad view was that interest rate cuts in Europe will open the way for a reduction in UK base rates and also, by rejuvenating other continental European economies, give a boost to Britain's own economic recovery. Consequently, there were buyers both for stocks with interests or markets in France or elsewhere in Europe, but also for domestic retail or consumer stocks which would benefit quickly from a further lowering of UK base rates. While a cut in base rates has long been foreshadowed in the stock market, the latest ERM developments strengthen the chances that the move will come soon. 'The best news of all is that lower UK interest rates can be sustained . . . we forecast base rates still at 4 per cent at the end of 1994,' said Mr Roger Bootle at Midland Bank. At Strauss Turnbull, Mr Ian Harnett sees base rates at 5 per cent until the year-end. Strauss yesterday raised its year-end Footsie forecast to 3,250; Mr Harnett believes that dollar stocks will join in the upswing as lower interest rates in Europe help the US currency. Mr Nick Knight, the Nomura analyst regarded as the most bullish of UK equity strategists, has reaffirmed his 3,500 year-end forecast, stressing that 'the market to buy is the UK'. He suspects that interest rate cuts may have been well discounted in the French market. There was some disappointment in London, however, that equity trading volume was restrained - the Seaq total of 697.9m shares compared with 763.5m on Friday, and traders warned of profit-taking pressure. Some analysts believe that if French rate cuts are delayed, then London could be vulnerable to further selling. But retail, or customer, business in UK equities has risen sharply, returning a worth of Pounds 1.72bn last Friday and a similar figure on Thursday.</p>

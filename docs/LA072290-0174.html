			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DEVELOPING VACANT LAND IN LAGUNA NIGUEL, LAGUNA BEACH  </P> <P> The city of Laguna Beach argued before the California Coastal Commission that  it was OK to develop and fill in 3 1/2 acres of the Laguna Greenbelt because it  was only a little bit and because we had so much open space. Incredibly, the  commissioners were persuaded by the argument!  </P> <P> Opponents to the proposed Alta Laguna Sports Complex displayed slides of aerial  photographs that dramatically showed the scar that the present five-acre graded  park site has inflicted upon the beautiful, pristine open space. However, a  number of the "swing vote" commissioners noted that the pictures showed how  vast the Laguna Greenbelt was and that developing a little bit wouldn't hurt.  </P> <P> This concerns me greatly regarding all the efforts to acquire the Irvine Co.'s  Laguna Laurel acreage. The Irvine Co. has plans to build a 3,200-house  development in Laguna Canyon.  </P> <P> I believe it is essential to stop this development and to acquire the land and  keep it natural for all future generations. It is most important for all our  citizens' quality of life to have refuge from the urban sprawl that is  engulfing us.  </P> <P> But why bother acquiring the open space if projects will come up in the future  to develop it, perhaps on a piecemeal basis? It is essential that as we are  successful in acquiring this property, provisions are made to prevent  development in the newly acquired open space in the future.  </P> <P> If we acquire Laguna Laurel, developers will have even a stronger argument that  "developing a little won't hurt" as we will have even more open space. We need  to ensure that developing our open space can only occur by a vote of the  people. Laguna Beach should have the Open Space Element of the General Plan  ratified by the people in November with the proviso that no portion could be  sold off or developed without the voters' concurrence.  </P> <P> GENE FELDER  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: Groupe Bull cuts deficit to FFr942m Groupe Bull, the French computer group which is due to be privatised, yesterday announced a significant improvement in results for the first quarter of the year, cutting net losses to FFr942m (Dollars 160m) from FFr1.72bn in the same period in 1993. The company, which has lost more than FFr15bn over the past three years, said the improvement in results demonstrated strong progress in its recovery strategy. That strategy is based on three priorities; an increase in revenues, a drastic reduction in non-salary costs, and improved productivity. It has been put into effect by Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries, chairman, who came to the group in October. Turnover grew by 20 per cent in the first three months, to FFr6.15bn. The improvement partly reflected a strong sales performance at Zenith Data Systems, the microcomputer division, which increased turnover by more than 70 per cent. Most of Bull's other operating divisions also saw sales increases. However, the principal reason for the decline in losses was the reduction in non-salary costs. Bull said these costs, which include buildings, supplies and financial charges, were reduced by FFr453m and represented 58 per cent of the fall in net losses. The group said cost-cutting measures were continuing. In April, many corporate activities were transferred from Tour Bull in the Defense business district of Paris to a cheaper site in the suburbs. The management teams of the Bull Europe and the Bull Overseas divisions will shortly be transferred to the cheaper site. Bull said orders rose sharply in the first three months. Hardware and software commissions grew by 27 per cent, while orders for systems integration contracts increased by 33 per cent. The company said the improved demand partly reflected the introduction of new products, such as the DPS 9000/800 business computer developed in co-operation with NEC of Japan. NEC, which holds a 4.43 per cent stake in Bull, may increase its investment as part of the French group's privatisation. Bull is holding negotiations with industry partners with the aim of reducing the government's holding to a minority by the end of the year.</p>

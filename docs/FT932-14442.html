			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Arts: Urban under-class Boheme - Opera North With the resurgence of tuberculosis as a serious threat to health in the West, the fate of poor consumptive operatic heroines is no longer the stuff of dewy-eyed romantic legend. It is easy to imagine a production of La Boheme set in the present-day - a tale of the urban under-class, in which any aspirations for the future are smothered by a life of poverty and decay. As it happened, the new production by Opera North did not go that far. Phyllida Lloyd, the producer, stopped short of bringing the opera right up-to-date and stayed (less persuasively?) in the period of beehive hair-dos and teenagers' motorbikes. Marcello, the painter, decorated his spartan living space with pop-art images of his girlfriend in the style of Andy Warhol. His student friends looked a fairly leftish lot, who pinned a cartoon of their landlord, marked 'fascist', up on the wall. None of this was really controversial, as it turned out; more a case of good, clean fun. A producer of this opera has to make sure that the scenes of young people's horseplay have plenty of energy to them, if the right contrasts of mood are to be set up, and Phyllida Lloyd does so with conviction. The scene outside Cafe Momus was great fun: the cafe itself is a gaudy coffee bar, while the winter crowds skate past the window on an ice rink outside. The end of the scene is marked by a parade of Father Christmases, which adds to the Anglo-Saxon flavour of the evening. Kerouac's On the Road is mentioned in the programme and Anthony Ward's settings are duly brashly American, but the good manners and palpably modest niceness of the leading couple make them seem distinctly English. (There is no red-blooded Italian feel to the production at all, despite the opera being sung in the original language.) What is important, however, is the way that this Mimi and Rodolfo win over one's sympathy from their first scene together. The Canadian soprano Jane Leslie MacKenzie was a genuinely touching Mimi, the singing sincere and nicely shaped. Her American partner, William Burden, proved a very interesting find, not a truly Puccinian Rodolfo, as the voice is too small and English (Mozart and Britten material) in sound, but everything he did was tasteful and vocally well produced. One really cared about both of them. The gaucherie with which they embark on their affair, the nervous smiles, the awkward wringing of the hands, all worked in the most charming way. They contrasted well, too, with Rodolfo's more outgoing friends - Robert Hayward's forceful Marcello and William Dazeley's Schaunard, who brought off his return from a fancy-dress party in drag with some elan. Juliet Booth made a lively, unexaggerated Musetta. Despite signs of immaturity (Rodolfo's sobs at the end and the silent circling of the other characters are overdone) the production hits its target. When Mimi enters in the last act, deathly pale, and lurches forwards to be sick in the kitchen sink, a shudder of realism goes down the spine. This is real verismo - a reminder that such illnesses are marching out of operatic fiction and back into real-life documentary. Production sponsored by Yorkshire Television. Further performances in Leeds until 22 May, then Manchester, Nottingham, Hull and Sheffield.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Exchange rate machismo ends: Spanish devaluation underlines monetary split in the EC EXCHANGE RATE machismo finally went out of fashion yesterday when the Spanish and Portuguese governments requested a devaluation of their currencies within the European exchange rate mechanism. The events underline the monetary split in the European Community between the 'inner core' nations centred on Germany and other countries which are constrained by economic weakness in pegging their currencies to the D-Mark. Yesterday's discussions in the EC's monetary committee illustrate the new sense of realism established in Europe over exchange rates in the aftermath of last year's ERM crisis. Out has gone the idea that countries should cling on to their ERM parities regardless of the cost in terms of foreign-currency reserves, high interest rates and high exchange rates reducing export competitiveness. Instead has come a sense of submission to the forces of the Dollars 1,000bn-a-day currency market. The new mood has been struck most forcibly by the Bundesbank, which has been conveying ever more rigorously its view that countries with currencies under persistent strain should seek timely devaluations. Admittedly, in the case of Spain, the pressures of a general election campaign played their part in forcing the peseta into its third devaluation since the onset of ERM turbulence last September. Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, and Mr Carlos Solchaga, the finance minister, have become aware in recent weeks that their government's hold on power was being increasingly put at risk by the economic rigour needed to defend the peseta's D-Mark parity. Even so, Mr Solchaga went out of his way less than two weeks ago to rule out a further peseta re-adjustment. 'We are not going to devalue, not this weekend, nor the next weekend nor at any time on the horizon,' he told reporters in Washington where he was attending meetings of the International Monetary Fund. Yesterday's decision by Mr Gonzalez and Mr Solchaga to renege on this commitment was sparked by the heavy selling of the peseta on exchange markets on Wednesday, which forced the Bank of Spain to dig even deeper into its already depleted reserves. The ministers' action virtually forced Portugal also to request a devaluation  - the second affecting the escudo since last autumn  - by dint of the two countries' close trading links. Mr Luis Angel Rojo, the Bank of Spain governor, who met other EC central bank governors at Basle for their regular monthly meeting at the beginning of this week, did not discuss the move with them, Spanish officials said yesterday. However, the problems facing Spain were the subject of a special, secret discussion by the EC governors at their Basle meeting in March. 'We all knew the Spaniards were in for a rough ride (in keeping the peseta within its ERM limit) and some of us were surprised they held out for so long,' a central banker said yesterday. Another banker suggested that the decision to seek a devaluation in trading hours smacked of panic. However, another point of view was that Spain announced its move yesterday morning to prevent more damaging speculation against the peseta as the monetary committee meeting  - a regular event scheduled weeks ago  - took place. Yesterday's development was likely to reinforce already existing pressures for a two or multi-speed drive towards monetary integration in Europe. Spain and Portugal are now clearly in the slow lane, along with Britain and Italy, which both left the ERM last year. The devaluation of the Spanish and Portuguese currencies comes in spite of increasingly aggressive moves by the Bundesbank to cut interest rates in recent weeks  - events which in theory should have reduced the pressures on some of the weaker ERM currencies. Even so, in several statements during the past few weeks, the Bundesbank has made clear its extreme reluctance to take part in open-ended intervention operations to bail out currencies judged by the market to be fundamentally over-valued.</p>

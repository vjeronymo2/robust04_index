This action will relieve the bridge owner of the unnecessary burden of having personnel at the bridge at all times during the above period and should still provide for the reasonable needs of navigation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received on or before February 10, 1995.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments should be mailed to Commander (obr), First Coast Guard District, Captain John Foster Williams Federal Building, 408 Atlantic Ave., Boston, Massachusetts 02110&hyph;3350.

Vessels from the Milton Yacht Club are the primary users of the Granite Avenue Bridge. The yacht club is located upstream of the bridge. The yacht club docks are removed from the waterway in December of each year and there are no other waterway users that would require openings during the winter months. Because of this lack of facility, the bridge owner, the Massachusetts Highway Department (MHD), proposes to have drawtenders on one hour recall to respond to requests for openings at all times from November 1 to April 30 and from May 1 through October 31; 12 a.m. to 6 a.m. daily.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Proposed Amendments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MHD has requested a change to the present operating regulations in 33 CFR &sect;117.611, which require that the bridge open on signal from May 1 through October 31 at all times and from April 1 through April 30 and November 1 through December 31, the bridge shall open on signal from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily. At all other times the bridge shall open if at least a twenty four (24) hour advance notice is given to the bridge owner by calling the number posted at bridge. There have been few requests for openings during the proposed one (1) hour advance notice time periods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The bridge owner has requested that the bridge open on signal from May 1 through October 31; 6 a.m. to 12 midnight. At all other times the bridge will open if at least a one hour advance notice is given by calling the number posted at the bridge. This change to the regulations is being proposed due to the infrequent requests for openings during the proposed one (1) hour advance notice time periods. This action will relieve the bridge owner of the burden of having personnel at the bridge during the above time periods but should still provide for the reasonable needs of navigation. The drawtenders will be on call to open the draw when the advance notice is given to the highway department by calling the number posted at the bridge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation, under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT, is unnecessary. This conclusion is based on the fact that the regulation will not prevent mariners from transiting the Granite Avenue Bridge. It will require only that mariners plan their transits and provide a one hour advance notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Small Entities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), the Coast Guard must consider whether this action will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). Because of the reasons discussed in the Regulatory Evaluation above, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this action, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

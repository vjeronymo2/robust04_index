			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / International Company News: Cincinnati Milacron doubles income CINCINNATI MILACRON, the US machine tools and plastics machinery group, yesterday announced more than doubled second-quarter operating earnings, but expressed concern about the condition of US and European economies. Operating net rose from Dollars 2.77m, or 10 cents a share, to Dollars 5.83m, or 18 cents. The latest figure excludes a Dollars 4.4m charge for early extinguishment of debt, while the 1992 figure excludes a Dollars 700,000 gain from a loss carry-forward. For the first six months, operating net earnings jumped from Dollars 3.88m, or 14 cents a share, to Dollars 10.1m, or 33 cents. However, the latest figure excludes both the Dollars 4.4m charge and a charge of Dollars 52.1m for accounting changes. The 1992 figure excludes a Dollars 900,000 gain from carry-forwards. Revenues jumped from Dollars 185.6m to Dollars 237.2m in the latest quarter, taking the six-month total to Dollars 458.2m, against Dollars 345.6m. Mr Daniel Meyer, chairman, said Milacron's first-half results were on target.</p>

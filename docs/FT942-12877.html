			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome setback Pharmaceutical group Wellcome led the drug sector down as its shares tumbled 14 to 499p, the first time they have been below 500p for more than three years. The slide was prompted by news that Rhone-Poulenc Rorer was making progress with a new anti-AIDS treatment. However, analysts were bemused by the effect of the news pointing out that the French company had not even begun clinical trials. Mr Paul Woodhouse, of Smith New Court, said: 'The market is not interested in vaguely encouraging news but anything vaguely bearish hits the shares.' Smith has just published positive research on the US sector arguing that investors have discounted the economic recovery there and are beginning switching back into defensive stocks. 'We should be watching the UK sector very carefully over the next couple of months,' said Mr Woodhouse. Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham shed a penny each to 553p and 375p. Turnover in aerospace and motor component group Lucas Industries reached 40m as dealers said the company's pension fund sold 20m shares to Smith New Court at 206p. The broker placed them in the market at 208p. It was the highest turnover recorded in the shares since 1987. Lucas shares slipped 5 to 210p. Full-year results from Sears saw the shares marked down, closing 8 1/2 lower at 123p with a hefty 25m traded, the highest in over a year. Although the high street retailer produced figures largely in line with forecasts, expectations had been raised higher by recent talk of strong sales. In the event, Sears said trading remained tough, and analysts downgraded their forecasts slightly for 1994-5 to a range of Pounds 145m to Pounds 152m. Two big rights issue stories in the leisure sector sent shares in the respective companies retreating sharply. Compass moved to stem the steep fall in the shares begun early in the session, confirming rumours of its interest in a US catering group. The proposed purchase of Canteen Corporation will cost the UK caterer Dollars 450m, half of which is to be funded from a rights issue. Compass shares closed 13 down at 316p. There was increased speculation that Airtours, the tour operator and holiday retailer, will also announce a rights issue to buy SAS Leisure, a subsidiary of the Swedish tour operator SAS, for around Pounds 94m. Airtours shares slid 14 to 466p. A search for companies with large cash holdings and investments and liable to suffer, like AB Foods, from a sharp drop in investment income following the steep falls in gilt-edged stocks eventually focused on GEC, the UK's flagship electronics group. Electronics specialists said GEC shares retreated for much of the session on a story that the company's investment returns on cash would be similarly affected. Analysts pointed out that GEC had no exposure to bonds and that its cash was mainly in top quality short-term deposits. Nevertheless, one institution was said to have sold a block of 2m GEC into the market at 306p. With those shares washing around the market the stock price failed to respond to the general market upsurge, closing a net 4 off at 309p. Turnover reached 9.2m. The absence of a much-rumoured bid for Lasmo, the oil exploration company, saw the company's shares ease back but failed to choke off the extremely heavy activity in the ordinary shares, nil-paids and traded options. However, dealers said there were strong rumours that Lasmo would attract a bid before the week is out. The ordinaries closed 2 off at 153p with 18m traded, the nil-paids fell a penny to 49p on 5.5m traded. Turnover in the traded options was also high. Talk of a break-up bid for Vickers inspired the shares to a rise of 6 to 194p with turnover at 3.7m. British Aerospace slipped back 7 to 478p on talk of continuing tough trading in the regional aircraft business at the group's agm. Shell rose 4 to 728p after announcing it has sold an asset in the far east worth Pounds 350m in net income in the second quarter. The company refused to give details. BP rose 2 more to an all-time closing high of 391p on heavy turnover of 17m shares. Oil analysts said UK fund managers were having to fill in underweight positions in the stock.</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Bundesbank's whispers turn to shouts THE guardians of the D-Mark have forsaken their traditional low-key communications techniques. The masters of the Delphic mumble have taken instead to shouting their message from the rooftops. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, and his partners on the bank's council have found new confidence. In a series of speeches they have spelt out with uncommon and increasing clarity the failings of German financial and economic policies, and at the same time exposed the potholes in the road to European monetary union. The Bundesbank has taken advantage of the confusion and uncertainty paralysing European Community politics and disrupting money markets. After absorbing intense and fierce criticism of its policies for almost two years, it feels the time has come to do more than repeatedly defend its rigid stance and has sprung on to the offensive. Irritated by impertinent foreign demands for interest rate cuts, the bank has started shooting back at the politicians making them. It has also successfully off-loaded the responsibility for its rigid monetary stance on to Bonn. Mr Schlesinger's campaigning reached a new high on Tuesday when he announced that mechanisms designed to keep the European monetary system stable did not work. The obligation on central banks to intervene in support of weaker currencies within the exchange rate mechanism was little more than an invitation for speculators, he said. The bank is estimated to have lost more than DM1bn (Pounds 400m) during recent fruitless battles to defend sterling and the lira, and was intervening again yesterday as the French franc came under strain. President Schlesinger underlined his concerns by repeating a blast from a speech made 10 days earlier. Then he proclaimed that the economic convergence criteria governing the transition to a common currency were neither clear nor tough enough. Without changes, monetary union could be infected with the deadly inflation virus from the outset. While still insisting that there is no need for fundamental reforms, the bank has succinctly imparted how little it thinks of politicians' attempts at monetary engineering. Although Bonn appeared to have accepted that priority should be given to cutting subsidies rather than shuffling the numbers, Mr Schlesinger is still waiting for signs of the drastic economies urged by Chancellor Kohl's own independent advisers. Apart from higher short-term borrowing, anathema to the bank, the government had not yet found a way to share out the costs of unification, he said. If a solution was not found the issue would be resolved through higher taxes or higher inflation. 'We can take it for granted that no-one wants the latter.' In this week's speech he also opened up with unaccustomed vigour on politicians who had the nerve to exert 'moral pressure' on the Bundesbank to cut interest rates while it was still battling to win the war against German inflation. He made plain that if politicians wanted to help stabilise markets and reduce money market speculators' room for manoeuvre, they would be better advised to stop regarding exchange rates as tokens of political prestige and give their central banks independence. The sort of pressure exerted on the Bundesbank of late actually increased doubts about Emu, claimed the man who has raised more than his share of grave concerns. But he left his audience with no doubts about his stance on interest rates. It would be a mistake, even taking into account the 'short-term problems' of partner countries, for the Bundesbank to try to iron out domestic economic difficulties with a lax monetary policy. That would be a disservice to European monetary integration, he declared. With that, he dropped the community's most gnawed-at bone of contention in Chancellor Kohl's backyard, and stalked off back to Frankfurt.</p>

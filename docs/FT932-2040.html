			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Survey of Nordic Banking and Finance (4): Shareholders show support / Profile of Kansallis-Osake-Pankki WHEN Mr Pertti Voutilainen took over as chief executive of Kansallis-Osake-Pankki last year, his move from a state-owned mining group to the private sector banking world prompted a student to ask what qualified him for the job, writes Christopher Brown-Humes. 'My experience of running state-owned companies,' he replied. The joke, which reflected on a growing state role in the rescue of Finland's beleaguered banking sector, could easily have gone sour as the country's leading commercial bank turned out to be in much worse shape than he expected when he first arrived. In 1992 it piled up a FM3.7bn deficit, more than double 1991's FM1.61bn loss, after lending losses tripled to FM4.27bn from FM1.34bn. In August it availed itself of a FM1.73bn injection of preference capital from the government and by the end of the year it looked a clear candidate for a more extensive state bail-out. Since then, though, things have started to look up. Losses have begun to show a declining trend, thanks to the steep fall in Finnish interest rates since last autumn. Just as importantly, the bank has successfully raised FM1bn through a rights issue, demonstrating strong shareholder support for its efforts to solve its problems on its own and reducing the likelihood that it will need to ask for state assistance. The decisive move came in February when KOP announced plans to raise some FM3bn through a rights issue and domestic and international debt issues. It was the first bank in the region to ask shareholders to help it to weather the financial crisis and there was widespread scepticism about its chances of success given the broader difficulties within Finnish banking. In fact, KOP not only raised the FM930m it was originally seeking, but it marginally increased the size of the issue to FM1bn because of over-subscription. Part of the reason for its success was the almost-missionary zeal with which it appealed to small shareholders across the land to 'save' the bank from state clutches. Another important factor was the bank's increasingly optimistic tone about its recovery prospects. Mr Voutilainen says he expects the bank's loss for 1993 to halve to about FM2bn, on the back of lower credit losses, with a return to profit by 1995. There has been some scepticism about these projections, with some analysts predicting that the bank could still make a loss of FM3-3.5bn this year. They draw attention to the depressed state of the domestic economy and say credit losses from small and medium-sized businesses will still be huge. Furthermore, loan losses in the municipal and household sectors are rising. Mr Voutilainen cautions that the bank's recovery hinges on wider economic recovery. 'The bank is sick because the economy of our country is sick,' he says. He also accepts that the bank needs to raise more capital to strengthen its capital base, as losses continue to erode its 9 per cent international capital adequacy ratio. The plan is to raise about FM2bn this year and next through a series of domestic and international debt issues. A bond issue in the domestic market to raise FM300m has already been launched and it is expected to be supplemented by issues for a further FM500m-FM1bn later in the year. In addition, analysts believe the bank may launch another rights issue when it believes the market can digest it. The Finnish banking crisis has taken its toll on KOP in a number of ways. It has forced rationalisation, with staff numbers being cut last year by 8 per cent to 8,500. It has also led to a more focused international strategy, with the emphasis now on treasury operations and the funding of domestic clients abroad. Gone are the days when the group would readily build up a FM200m exposure to an international property group such as Olympia &amp; York. Inevitably the focus is much more on the domestic market, where KOP is playing its part in the wider reshaping of the banking sector. Already this year it has taken a significant step with a takeover of the country's sixth-largest bank, STS, in a move which has boosted its presence in the household sector and in the Helsinki region. It has also held discussions with the state authorities about a takeover of the two savings bank groups, Skopbank and the Savings Bank of Finland. Such a move would give it a theoretical market share of 40 per cent and has been resisted by the bank's competitors. In any case, Merrill Lynch has now been called in to examine all options for the future of the two groups, so the talks with KOP are on the back burner. Mr Voutilainen says further restructuring in the banking sector is inevitable in a country which is 'over-branched if not over-banked.' Of the main banks which today command a nationwide network - KOP, Unitas, Postipankki, Okobank and the savings banks - he believes at least one and possibly two will disappear.</p>

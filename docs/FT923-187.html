			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Lamont's stock tumbles after heady political ride - Peter Norman explains how the UK Chancellor ran into German and British flak when trying to play the two audiences simultaneously 'LAMONTS' used to be a rather dull little stock with a limited political future. They have suddenly emerged as the most volatile issue on the City and Westminster gossip exchanges. Two weeks ago, as the pound was forced out of the European exchange rate mechanism, Mr Norman Lamont's future looked bleak indeed. The chancellor appeared unlikely to survive the sterling crisis. Seven days later, by contrast, he seemed on top of the world. With a one percentage point cut in interest rates under his belt and growing support from the Eurosceptic wing of the Tory party, he was the popular advocate of a 'British policy in British interests'. Yesterday Mr Lamont's fortunes took another tumble. Remarks by the chancellor at the end of Monday's meeting of European Community economics and finance ministers in Brussels were widely construed as an apology to Germany for earlier remarks criticising the Bundesbank's role in the sterling crisis. He awoke yesterday morning to find the Daily Telegraph - the one newspaper he takes more seriously than any other - urging his resignation and the early editions of yesterday's Evening Standard reporting fury in the Conservative ranks after the 'humiliation' of his words of regret to Germany. Not for the first time in the past three weeks, observers of UK economic policy making were left shaking their heads and asking what is really going on. Mr Lamont's latest discomfiture is a salutary tale on several levels. It shows how UK domestic party politics do not travel in the European Community and how Britain, for all its pro-European rhetoric before Black Wednesday, stands apart from all its other EC partners in harbouring serious doubts about the utility of the European Monetary System in its present form. Mr Lamont's latest stumble highlights the problems of playing simultaneously to two audiences. Relations between the UK Treasury and the Bundesbank have been poor since the beginning of September when Mr Lamont tried and failed to force a cut in German interest rates at the informal meeting of economics and finance ministers in Bath. The Treasury is also firm in its belief that its efforts to prop up the pound on black Wednesday were fatally undermined by Bundesbank indiscretions. This sense of anger was not assuaged by the very substantial support given by the German central bank to the French franc last week: support that had not been available on such a scale for sterling on September 16. Mr Lamont's obvious irritation with the Bundesbank and his apparent determination not to return quickly to the ERM made him the new hero of the Eurosceptic wing of the Conservative Party. This contributed to the strong support he was given last Thursday when he successfully defended himself in the commons debate on the economy. In his speech, the chancellor once again pinned the blame for sterling's fall on the Bundesbank. During the previous week, however, he had also been trying to mend fences with Germany. This was apparent in Washington during the weekend after sterling's float where he attended meetings with Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, and Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister. At that time, UK officials insisted that both sides wanted to put the bad blood behind them. But it seemed that every dose of soothing words on the international stage from Mr Lamont was matched by some criticism of German policy, designed for the UK audience. In Brussels, Mr Lamont's approach of policy of tailoring his remarks to his audience caught up with him. His statement at a press conference that 'I am sorry if anything has been said that greatly upsets them' was widely construed as a personal apology to Germany and therefore as a humiliating climbdown. His subsequent clarification that he was referring only to comments in the press for which he has no responsibility has put back the controversy to square one. But the events of the past days have done more than that. The Brussels meeting, when the other 11 EC nations rallied behind the ERM, showed that in a beauty contest between the UK government and the Bundesbank, Britain's erstwhile ERM partners will opt for the Bundesbank every time. This week's meeting of EC ministers also exposed Britain's lack of concrete suggestions for reforming the ERM, despite the lapse of several days since the prime minister and chancellor first detected 'fault lines' in the system. Britain is still without a clear plan on how to approach the ERM question at the Birmingham summit of EC leaders on October 16. It became clear yesterday that the Treasury has neither broad proposals for a significant change in the system nor specific ideas for detailed technical changes. In normal circumstances, such an absence of initiatives could be bearish for Mr Lamont's stock. But the chancellor can probably rest easy for the time being. The UK parliament is not due to reconvene until October 19. Before then he will have an opportunity to restore his reputation at next week's Conservative Party Conference It remains to be seen how he will negotiate the high wire between his Eurosceptic supporters at home and his increasingly frustrated colleagues among the EC's finance ministers.</p>

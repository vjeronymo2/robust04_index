			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Bush and Clinton stand their ground in TV debate PRESIDENT George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton fought each other to a reasonably civilised stand-off in their first televised debate of the US presidential election last night. Neither the Republican nor the Democratic contender committed an obvious, egregious mistake in the first of their three confrontations over the next eight days. Both were well prepared and, if Mr Bush appeared initially the more relaxed, Mr Clinton warmed to his task. Mr Ross Perot, the independent candidate, generated the most applause and laughter with his epigrammatic interventions at the debate in St Louis, Missouri. The closest the debate came to fireworks was early on when the president insisted that Mr Clinton was wrong to have participated in demonstrations against the Vietnam war while a student at Oxford. 'I couldn't do that and I don't think most Americans could,' Mr Bush said. Mr Clinton responded by comparing the president's attacks on his patriotism to the tactics of the late Senator Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s. He cited Mr Bush's father, Prescott Bush, at the time a senator from Connecticut, as a man who had spoken out against McCarthyism. Mr Bush's frequently repeated theme was one of optimism. He said more than once that 'America is not coming apart at the seams', as he said Mr Clinton consistently implied, and that the US was 'still the envy of the world'. He emphasised in his closing statement that experience and trust were the special qualities he brought to the election. Mr Clinton's equally consistent message was that the time had come for change at home and abroad. Mr Perot, in perhaps the only intervention of his that might be seen as helpful to Mr Clinton, said the president was wrong to focus on what his Democratic opponent had done as a youth. In one possible surprise, Mr Bush hinted that, if re-elected, he would 'tell Jim Baker to do in domestic affairs what you've done in foreign affairs'. It had been generally assumed Mr Baker would return to the State Department in any Bush second term. Mr Clinton ducked an invitation to attack the Federal Reserve for its conduct of monetary policy. If he became president, he said, 'I don't have to worry in the short term about the Fed, their policies seem to me pretty sound'. It was more important, he argued, 'to use the powers the president does have' over the economy. The Democratic candidate probably scored most heavily in his detailed responses on issues such as health care, the need for racial harmony and a proper understanding of the problems of contemporary families. The first instant reaction came from an ABC TV poll, which found that 27 per cent thought Mr Clinton had won, 22 per cent Mr Perot and 18 per cent Mr Bush, with the rest undecided. Asked for their presidential preferences, compared to the previous poll, Mr Clinton went up one point to 46 per cent, Mr Bush down 4 points to 31 per cent and Mr Perot up 7 points to 15 per cent.</p>

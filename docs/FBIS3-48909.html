The  newspapers detail the last hours of Zhirinovskiy's visit here.  He left for Moscow by a scheduled flight at 14:20 p.m. local  time. "The interior minister's order for Zhirinovskiy's  expulsion was unnecessary, stupid and leaves open the question  about the real motives. It also is indicative of a temper  lost," runs a commentary in KONTINENT daily, adding that "talks  with Zhirinovskiy should have been held only by force of  argument, or no comments should have been made at all -- just  the way the president had reacted in the case of U.S. Ambassador  William Montgomery's statements," an editorial commentary in 24  CHASA blames the president's advisers for having invited only  foreign correspondents and reporters of "selected Bulgarian Mass  media" to hear Dr. Zhelev's remarks yesterday.    The trade union daily TRUD runs an interview with Svetoslav  Stoilov whom Zhirinovskiy proclaimed as the future president of  Bulgaria. Asked if he really believed he was going to be the  next president of Bulgaria, Stoilov said, "Me, a Bulgarian  president? This statement is offending me. I am going to be  president of the Balkans (of all countries on the Balkan  peninsula). A severe cataclysm is due in Bulgaria. We will  throw all the present parties into the Black Sea. The plan is  ready." Interviewed for the Socialist Party daily DUMA, the  leader of the Bulgarian Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Veselin  Koshev says that before leaving Bulgaria Zhirinovskiy had  declared he would come back here as president of Russia. Koshev  says that the Bulgarian LDP invited Zhirinovskiy to visit  Bulgaria again in March or April next year, and a delegation of  LDP will visit Moscow in January. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Promise of lower interest rates helps bourses THE PROMISE of lower interest rates, and higher bond markets had varied effects on the Continent yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. MADRID closed sharply higher, boosted by the Bank of Spain's cut in its daily rate on liquidity injections to the market. The general index rose 3.73 to 264.77, up 2.7 per cent on the week. The Bank of Spain's move to cut its average daily rate by 22 basis points to 11.52 per cent was seen as clearing the way for a cut in its official benchmark rate of 11.25 per cent. Mr Stephen Hughes at Kleinwort Benson added that there was a political angle, in that discussions between Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the victorious Socialist prime minister, and the CiU, the Catalan nationalist party, seemed to hold out the prospect of stable government. Interest rate-sensitive stocks moved, with gains in banks and most utilities. Big blue chips reflected the more general bullishness, with Repsol Pta70 higher at Pta3,335 and Telefonica up Pta40 at Pta1,435. FRANKFURT saw a huge increase in turnover as DTB options expired, but little share price volatility as the DAX index closed 5.39 lower at 1,686.90, a fraction higher on the week. Turnover virtually trebled to DM15.4bn with Allianz, Siemens, Daimler and Deutsche Bank accounting for over DM6bn between them. Banks mostly ignored gains in the fixed interest market, where the Bundesbank's average bond yield fell three basis points to 6.57 per cent and looked to be extending that trend in the afternoon. Deutsche Bank lost DM5.50 to DM692 and Dresdner DM3.20 to DM378.50. On the upside, news of lower taxes on German trucks left MAN DM3.50 higher at DM272.50. Among second and third-liners, Viag's Gerresheimer Glas subsidiary fell DM4.50 to DM214 on a first-half loss, and widening losses at Technocell, the technical paper group, took its shares down DM20 to DM237. PARIS built on Thursday's gains, helped by a stronger bond market, and expectations of a further 25 basis point cut in interest rates on Monday. The CAC-40 index settled up 9.98 at 1,910.29, slightly lower on the week. Turnover was put at FFr2.6bn. Investors continued to react to profit warnings from Havas and St Gobain and the shares slipped respectively by FFr2.00 and FFr1.50 to FFr412.10 and FFr475.20. LVMH advanced FFr13 to FFr3,729 following a presentation in London on Thursday and positive brokers' reports released this week. Credit Local de France featured with a FFr8 rise to FFr407 after the government set the sale price of 10.9m shares being offered to the public at FFr386. MILAN continued to be supported by Ferruzzi group companies, which have begun to recover some of the losses of the last couple of weeks. The Comit index closed 6.01 higher at 527.97, down 0.7 per cent on the week. The market's rise was also helped by strength in Fiat, which climbed L258 to L5,978 at the close and to L6,120 on the kerb. There have been suggestions that the restructuring of Ferruzzi might lead to a delay in the privatisation schedule, particularly as Credito Italiano and BCI - two of the Ferruzzi creditor banks - are among leading candidates for flotation. However, Mr William Cowan, an analyst with James Capel in London, commented that while, in the short term, the privatisation of Credito would probably be held up, he did not see the process as a whole getting under way until some time in 1994. This was because of the continuing political uncertainty  -elections may be held in the autumn  - and the packed legislative programme, he said. Ferruzzi gained L90.70 or 16 per cent to L635.50, a loss of 13 per cent on the week and Montedison improved L93 to L939, 3.7 per cent lower on the week. Among the banks, BCI put on L63 to L5,143 and Credito L23 to L2,701; Mediobanca rose L640 to L15,840, then to L16,200 on the kerb. AMSTERDAM was given a boost by the strength of the dollar. The expiry of June options and futures had little negative impact. The CBS Tendency index closed 0.3 higher at 109.2, an improvement of 1.9 per cent on the week. Royal Dutch struck an all time high, up Fl 2.00 to Fl 175.70, helped by strong overnight US buying. Among other multinationals, Unilever gained Fl 1.10 to Fl 198.50. STOCKHOLM fell back in spite of a 1.6 per cent gain in Ericsson, up SKr5 to SKr319, after winning further new orders. The Affarsvarlden general index lost 3.00 to 1,078.90. ISTANBUL leapt by 5.4 per cent to its seventh record close of the month, cash continuing to flow into the market on political and economic optimism, as well as bright six-month profit expectations. The market index closed 538.83 higher at a provisional 10,460.80, up 18.4 per cent on the week on hopes that Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister, will pursue low interest rate policies, speed up privatisation and give more incentives to stock trading through equity-based mutual funds.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                   FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- June 18                                            THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes             Open      10.30     11.00     12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1187.44   1187.02   1186.66   1186.99 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1242.64   1243.05   1243.59   1243.22  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             13.00     14.00     15.00     Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1188.31   1187.56   1187.50   1186.72 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1242.39   1244.07   1241.89   1242.58  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Jun 17    Jun 16    Jun 15    Jun 14    June 11  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1182.69   1181.17   1173.17   1181.59   1181.85 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1238.06   1236.97   1229.86   1234.83   1232.37  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1189.01 ; 200 -  1245.96 Low/day: 100 -  1185.92  200 -  1240.21 .  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Call for cuts shocks London hospital chiefs BIG CUTS in the number of hospitals providing specialist services in London and the south-east were recommended by a series of government-appointed reviews yesterday. Publication of the reviews - the latest move in a delicate government strategy aimed at bringing about extensive bed closures in London - provoked protests from hospitals threatened by the proposals. Yesterday's specialist review reports added to doubts about the future of famous institutions such as Harefield heart hospital In Uxbridge, the Royal Marsden cancer hospital in south-west London and St Bartholomew's in the City. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, stressed that no decisions on the transfer of services or hospital closures would be made on the basis of the review recommendations alone. She said they added a further perspective to the forthcoming changes to London's health services, but 'they do not paint the final picture'. It is a picture that must have become deeply confusing for many Londoners. Last October a government-appointed inquiry under Sir Bernard Tomlinson recommended hospital closures and a shift of resources to family-doctor and community services. Mrs Bottomley accepted the thrust of the Tomlinson report in February, with detailed decisions awaiting further work, including the specialist reviews. But in some cases the reviews have reached contrary conclusions to Tomlinson and since - unlike Sir Bernard - they extended their investigations to outer London and the home counties, more hospitals have been drawn into the restructuring net. The overall message of the reviews - which examined cardiac, cancer, renal, neurosciences, children's and plastics and burns services - is that London and the south-east have an excessive number of relatively small units providing specialist services. On cancer services, for example, the review finds that many of the 15 specialist cancer centres within the M25 are only half the size of comparable units elsewhere in Britain, often lacking a full range of modern equipment and medical expertise. It envisages eight bigger centres. The survival of individual hospitals in the market-based National Health Service structure depends on income from contracts. So the loss of specialist services envisaged in the review could affect the viability of many hospitals - including some that survived the Tomlinson analysis intact. Mrs Bottomley is aware of the sensitivity of the decisions that she and London's four regional health authorities will have to start making later this year. She quickly made clear yesterday, for example, that she did not see any prospect of moving the internationally renowed Harefield hospital in the near future. The public expenditure climate presents Mrs Bottomley with an even more fundamental problem. Developing new, high-quality specialist services would be expensive, with little to be recouped from selling surplus hospital sites in the present property market. Professor Michael Besser, chief executive of St Bartholomew's, who is opposing his hospital's amalgamation with the Royal London on the latter's site, calculates that it could cost between Pounds 150m and Pounds 300m to combine the two hospitals without undermining the quality of services. Funding concerns were also expressed by Prof Sir Colin Dollery, pro vice-chancellor for medicine and dentistry at London University. He said that given the country's financial difficulties the lack of financial analysis in the reviews was a 'matter of deep concern'.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Money Markets: Cash flows tighten MONEY flows were tight yesterday as the clearing banks resisted early temptations to take up the Bank of England's offers of assistance and preferred to take short-term money rates instead, writes Peter John. Consequently, overnight money, which began the day at just below 7 per cent, was bought up to around 8 1/4 per cent before moving lower at the close. At the higher levels, the central bank offers became attractive again and 80 per cent of the forecast liquidity shortage was taken out. Three-month money remained stable at 7 1/8 per cent. Sterling futures returned to more credible levels after looking extraordinarily cheap for the past few days. The contract for March delivery, which tends to be the most sensitive indicator of the way interest rates could be heading was sold off at the opening, reflecting the sharp downturn in the pound. It rallied later to end the day 9 basis points up on the day at 93.50 with relatively thin turnover of 14,000 contracts by the official close. At that level it reaffirmed the market's belief that a further half a percentage point could be lopped off the base rate soon. Bank of England operations were cold-shouldered during the early part of the day with no help provided in the morning and only Pounds 30m of the final forecast of Pounds 1bn liquidity shortage taken up at noon. Among the main factors affecting the shortage were the take-up of treasury bills and paper maturing in official hands, expected to drain Pounds 827m from the system, bankers' balances below target and a rise in note circulation. These were partly offset by exchequer transactions adding Pounds 210m. At midday, the Bank bought Pounds 5m of band one bank bills at the 6 7/8 per cent rate and Pounds 25m of bills for resale on January 5 at 6 7/8 per cent. In the afternoon, the Bank bought Pounds 376m of band one and band two bank bills, both at 6 7/8 per cent rate. It also bought Pounds 29m of bills for resale on January 5 at 6 15/16 per cent. However, it was not until the official close that the shortage was addressed and even then it was not taken out. The Pounds 390m of late, unspecified assistance brought total help to only Pounds 796m. In Germany, call money was at 8.95 to 9 per cent in early trading. The Bundesbank added DM6.5bn of liquidity to the banking system with its weekly repo tender bringing the figure to DM77bn.</p>

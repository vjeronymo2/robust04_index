			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Books: The writer who made himself hero - JDF Jones on a new biography of Hemingway A LIFE WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES by James R Mellow Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 25, 704 pages NOT another biography of Ernest Hemingway? We are bound to be taken round the old familiar circuit of First War heroics, suicide father, boozing, big game and bullfighting, and then the sad decline, the hints of androgyny, the suppressed homosexuality, the self-inflicted shotgun death. It is somehow so easy to leave out that he was one of the few greatest writers of our century. It did not help that, from before the Second War until the 1961 death, Hemingway encouraged a personality cult. He projected himself as hero - macho Papa, hunter and deep-sea fisherman, wounded soldier, hard-drinking, hard-loving man-of-the-world. There has ever since been too much confusion between the Hemingway personality and his fictional protagonists - hence some bad biography and a lot of misdirected lit. crit. Far too many words have been devoted to relating Hemingway's dramatic life to his dramatic works: matching the cast of The Sun Also Rises, for example, to the pre-war expatriate community of Paris; his father's example as suicide; his sexual proclivity for short-haired cross-dressing; the supposed autobiography of A Farewell To Arms. (Hemingway actually spent only a few weeks as a teenaged ambulance driver on the Italian Front in 1918 and ever afterwards encouraged fantasies about his experiences there). The fact is that Hemingway's image long ago became mythic-heroic, which has made it difficult to separate fact from fiction, the author's life from the novelist's gifts. James Mellow confronts these problems rather well. His approach is eminently sensible. He refuses to make too much fuss about the trauma of the baby Ernest being dressed as a girl or his later vendetta against his mother; he suggests that the 1918 affair with the older nurse Agnes von Kurowsky was not so steamy, so intense, even so consummated, as would later appear in A Farewell To Arms; he adds proportion to the story of first-wife Hadley losing her husband's manuscripts; he analyses Hemingway's Republican allegiances in the Spanish Civil War; he is particularly well-balanced about the 1918 episode which has so exercised recent biographers - yes, Hemingway's wounding was ridiculously dramatised, with his own help, but 'it does not annul the fact that Hemingway in Italy had narrowly escaped death . . . Commonsense argues that the ordeal had an effect on his life . . . The confrontation of death proved to be one of his most vital and obsessive themes.' Mellow is good on the early days in Michigan, which were to produce the wonderful Nick Adams stories. Indeed, he is generally good on the books, especially the earlier ones - he has a better sense than most biographers and critics of the difficulty of writing good fiction. His judgments are sound: he signals out A Farewell To Arms and The Snows of Kiliminjaro as the great masterpieces, and he explains why. He is savage about the seductive A Moveable Feast in which Hemingway looked back on happy pre-war days with Hadley in Paris - 'an old man's romantic idyll and a vengeful summing-up'. The thesis - and here we nudge up against the problem - is that 'Nothing in Hemingway's life, before or after, would match the importance of the years that were centered in Paris (ie much of the 1920s). It would not be too much to say that Paris changed Hemingway's life as a writer - for better and worse, and significantly in both cases.' After Paris, 'whether intentionally or unconsciously, Hemingway set about creating a new persona . . .' It seems to be implied that this was the point when the rot set in. What we are not told, and what is still very hard to understand, is why Hemingway developed that new persona - if indeed it was new. At this point in an engrossing but overlong book the reader begins to understand that its structure is seriously askew. The balance is wrong: one-half of this biography is consumed with the first 27 years, there is far too much detail about the Paris period, and the later career is abbreviated to a degree which seriously damages the value of what Mr Mellow has been attempting. Only in the closing 'Acknowledgments' does he explain that this is the final volume in his trilogy about the Paris outcropping of the Modern Movement - 'a cultural revolution unequalled in its wide-reaching effects on Western culture except by the Italian Renaissance . . .' (That is surely a touch strong.) Mellow locates Hemingway at the heart of this pre-war revolution and is at his best in his detail of Stein, Pound, Fitzgerald, Anderson and all that galere. He chooses to view Hemingway as a 'continental' novelist. He is inadequately interested in what happened thereafter. Which seems a pity.</p>

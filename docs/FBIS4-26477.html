			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 22 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton today tried to calm down nervous financial markets,  saying the U.S. economy was fundamentally "very sound."    Speaking to reporters at the White House, Clinton minimized  Tuesday's [21 June] plunge in the value of the dollars.    "Let me just emphasize that the dollar as you know is traded  in big multinational markets with other currencies and they go  up and down," the President said. "But the fundamental economic  realities in this country are very sound."    He said the economy is growing, inflation is low and  unemployment has dropped dramatically. "I think we just have to  keep working on our fundamentals and in the end the markets will  have to respond to economic realities of the American economy,"  Clinton said.    The U.S. dollars had plunged to a post-World War Two low  against the Japanese yen and the lowest level in more than a  year against the German mark Tuesday.    The Bank of Japan intervened today to slow the dollars's  slide, but the German mark has retained its strength in  international markets.</p>

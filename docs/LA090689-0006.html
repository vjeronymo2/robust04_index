			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORE ON CONVENT AT DEATH CAMP  </P> <P> William Pfaff shed some much-needed light on the Polish feelings about the  Carmelite convent near Auschwitz ("Poles Suffered Too, but Justice Seems to  Give Jews Deciding Word on Auschwitz," Op-Ed, Aug. 28). However, he still  misses the point.  </P> <P> The convent is outside the camp fence. "The convent lawn is a former gravel pit  where political prisoners were gunned down by Nazi executioners in 1940 and  1941" (Times, Part I, July 15). Surely, a majority of those political prisoners  were Polish Christians. Indeed, ". . . a million Polish Catholics . . . were  killed by the Nazis at Auschwitz." (Times, Part I, Aug. 16). Auschwitz is,  therefore, the largest Polish, largest Catholic, largest Christian cemetery in  the history of the world.  </P> <P> The Jews have no legal or moral right to have the deciding word on the convent.  </P> <P> ROMAN J. ZAWADZKI, Los Angeles  </P></p>

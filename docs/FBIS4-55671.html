			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ivan Stojkovic: "Heroes on the Wrong Side of the </F> Law"]    [Text] The civil war, disintegration of Yugoslavia,  economic crisis, and the crisis of ethics have led to the  emergence of what is called the Vukovar syndrome, the domestic  version of the post-Vietnam era in the United States. Many  people, mostly young, have fought these last years on  battlefields, some as volunteers and others as members of  military units, where they have witnessed horrors, massacres,  killings and destruction. When some of them return from the  battlefield, they face unsurmountable problems of unemployment  and feelings of rejections and of being unable to fit into  society, so that many often decide to try their luck at fitting  in by operating outside the law. Many have been charged and  convicted of serious crimes in our country: murder, grand  larceny, unlawful possession of firearms.    The most recent example is that of Ilija Vujic, accused of  having murdered Vera Zidic and her son in an apartment in  Pohorska Street in Belgrade. The Pohorska Street case stirred up  the public, especially after Vujic's statement in the  investigation that he fired at Vera Zudic without reflection,  deliberately wounding her so that she would tell him where the  foreign currency was. From what we have learned in the Palace of  Justice, he has stated that he fired at Vera Zidic's son without  deliberation, as soon as he saw him. This is only one example  but the experts, the legal theoreticians and practitioners, say  that a new and still more cruel crime wave generated by the  Vukovar syndrome we mentioned threatens our country only when  the war is entirely over.  <H5>  Unaware of Crimes </H5>   "I think this Vukovar syndrome has grown beyond the limits  of  the post-Vietnam syndrome, since these boys, at least those whom  I have defended before the court, are not even aware that they  have committed a crime. I think we are dealing with a big  problem of society here, and I think we ought to organize  collective treatment of many volunteers and members of the  military who took part in this war. They have witnessed  horrifying massacres. The problem is that the police meet many  of these returnees from the war at the border, take away their  weapons and question them, although they have a permit from the  Srpska republic to carry them. It is no wonder that they are  often charged with the crime of assaulting an official. A large  number have also been convicted of unlawful possession of  firearms and of creating a general hazard. There have been  frequent examples of shots being fired in restaurants and the  like," says lawyer Borivoje Borovic.    According to him, there are even examples of disabled  returnees from the battlefield being convicted of some of these  crimes. Since many of them, Borovic says, do not have a job or  anything to live on, they feel rejected and are unable to adapt.  There have been many cases, Borovic says, when those who have  been convicted, wounded and disabled unfortunates, go back to  the battlefield after serving their sentence and lose their  lives there.    "All the lads I have defended were actually real heroes on  the battlefield. However, the horrors they experienced and the  welcome they received from our authorities had such an effect on  them that they have rebelled. I feel that the weapons permits  issued to the boys in the Srpska republic should be honored here  in the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] as well. However,  the view of the court applying the famous Article 33 of the Law  on Firearms is that those permits are not valid, and thus many  of them have been convicted of this. The police do not issue  weapons permits to many of these lads, and they take them into  custody for questioning. There is the well-known case of Zvonko  Osmajlic, whom the police in Subotica tried to frame in a murder  case. Even when he was released and the charges dropped, the  police took away his passport, supposedly because they were  unhappy with the court's action," Borovic says.  <H5>  Sad Tales </H5>   He says that the penalties for the crimes of inflicting  serious and light physical harm are increased in decisions of,  say, the Superior Court when returnees from the battlefield are  involved. Borovic says that under the influence of the Vukovar  syndrome the young men commit serious crimes with elements of  violence, and he says that in these cases forensic psychiatric  evaluation often finds that they were in a pathological  emotional state at the time they committed the crime.    In the past few years "blunderbuss" grenades have flown  around in Belgrade, immense quantities of arms have been found,  and many serious robberies have been committed. The question is  what is the main reason for this.    "These lads are returning from the battlefield, but actually  they have nothing to come back to. The first contact with the  state is in practice the encounter with the police. They are  treated as though they have come from another country. The case  of Nebojsa Markovic, for example, is interesting. He is a  volunteer who returned from the battlefield and was sentenced to  4 1/2 years in prison for involuntary manslaughter in the death  of his friend Vladimir Tadic. They were together in a group,  there was drinking, there were some verbal exchanges. Nebojsa  had a Scorpion automatic pistol and that is how this tragedy  occurred. Those returning from the battlefield should be told as  soon as they enter the country what awaits them here with  respect to the law, the possibility of fitting into normal life,  and weapons regulations. One man who was convicted provides a  typical example. He was carrying a grenade because he did not  know where to turn it in. He did not dare to leave it at home,  fearing someone might get hurt, and so in the end it was  activated when he was carrying it around and caused an  accident," says Miroslav Todorovic, judge at the Belgrade  District Court.    According to Todorovic, the veterans are usually convicted,  and the crimes are usually serious cases of robbery, murder and  unlawful possession of firearms. He emphasizes that the Law on  Weapons treats this area too severely, since an individual need  only have in his possession a pistol planted on him by someone  else, say, or one he is carrying, say, with papers from the  Srpska republic, and he will be convicted and punished very  severely, although it has not been established whether he had  any intention of using it for any purpose whatsoever.    All of these problems -- the legal confusion, war in the  vicinity, the disorganized state of society, and the  insufficient attention paid to the many young people who through  no fault of their own were compelled to take up arms and  participate in a bloody war with the blessing of the state --  threaten, once the civil war is over, to engender a still larger  number of crimes and turn many sound and able young men into  potential criminals on the wrong side of the law.</p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Peres bullish on peace talks MR Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, concluded a three-day visit to London yesterday full of optimism about closer ties with the European Community and about the chances of progress in the Middle East peace talks. He said Israel wanted to open a new chapter in relations with the EC following the victory of the Labour-led coalition in the country's June general election. Mr Peres was recently in the Soviet Union as part of a broader Israeli programme aimed at repairing old friendships bruised by the years of the previous Likud government and to begin new diplomatic contacts. During talks with Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, Mr Peres failed to win an immediate lifting of the British arms sales embargo imposed in response to Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. But Britain had promised to review the embargo, said Mr Peres. The Israeli foreign minister also expressed his hopes that the multilateral Middle East talks dealing with issues such as water and economic co-operation could be restructured so that all committees met at a single venue. He suggested the creation of a new bank for the region along the lines of the Euro-pean Bank for Reconstruction and Development. As for the bilateral peace talks, Mr Peres declared that the recent negotiating session with Syria in Washington represented the best 10 days in the history of the two countries. However, Mr Peres would not commit Israel to eventual withdrawal from the Golan Heights which it occupied in 1967 and said that the future for the Palestinians should be expressed in confederation with Jordan. Mr Major has promised that Britain will do all it can to speed up the peace process, although there has been little evidence of European input during the six rounds of negotiations since last October.</p>

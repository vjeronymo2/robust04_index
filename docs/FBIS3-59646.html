			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) provided  information about boiling water reactor (BWR) nuclear power  plants to China's Second Design Academy, which deals with  electrical power technology for non-commercial use. In China,  all of the power plants that are in operation or are planned are  the pressurized water reactor (PWR) type, but the course from  now on is to deal with BWR power plants. To Hitachi, Toshiba,  General Electric of the U.S., and other companies that deal with  BWRs, a new market will open for nuclear power plants in the  1,000-megawatt class, one of which costs &yen;300 to 500  billion. To TEPCO, as well, the effect of mass production will  lead to lower costs in the introduction of nuclear power.    Of the different types of BWRs, China shows interest in the  advanced boiling water reactor (ABWR), which has simplified  mechanics and keeps construction costs down. TEPCO told China  about the features of an ABWR: 1) the reactor housing vessel and  reactor building are small, and 2) the thermal efficiency is  1.1&percnt; higher than that of a conventional BWR. TEPCO is  building  an ABWR, which was jointly developed by TEPCO, Hitachi, Toshiba,  and GE, at its Kashiwazaki-Kariwa power plant (Kashiwazaki-shi;  output: 1,356 kW).    Because the transmission and transformer systems in China  are  small--Chinese-produced steam turbines are  600,000-kW-class--they are not the 1,000,000-kW-class  large-scale equipment as in Japan, so even with ABWRs China  wants 600,000-kW-class mid-scale reactors.    China's independently developed Qinshan No. 1 reactor will  go  into operation next year. Then, the Qinshan No. 2 and No. 3  reactors, and the Guangdong No. 1 and No. 2 reactors, the  technology for which is being introduced from France, are under  construction. All of those are PWRs. There is also a plan  underway to build a nuclear power plant in Liaoning Province  based on a nuclear power plant construction cooperation  agreement with Russia. That will also use a PWR. However,  limiting all nuclear power to PWRs apparently was judged as not  good for national policy.    China's route is to provide about 10&percnt; of its  electricity  with nuclear power by 2010, and for that it will need 20 to 30  nuclear power plants. There is a high possibility that China  will become a huge market for the nuclear power industry.</p>

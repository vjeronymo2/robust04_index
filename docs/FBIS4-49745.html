			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Random Notes on Hong Kong" column by A Bing (7093 3521): </F> "It Is High Time To Strengthen Communication"]    [Text] Lu Ping, vice director and secretary general of the  Preliminary Work Committee for the Preparatory Committee of the  Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [PWC], and other  mainland PWC members made a special trip to Hong Kong to attend  the meetings of the PWC political and economic subgroups. In  the last few days, they had a tight schedule. Apart from  attending the meetings, they met with representatives from  various social sectors and found time to visit grass-roots  people to understand how they lived. It is safe to say that by  gearing themselves to the needs of Hong Kong people, having  contacts with people from all walks of life and listening to  their opinions, the mainland PWC members were blazing a new  trail. Through understanding the real situation by having  contacts with people at all levels through various channels, the  PWC members, we believe, will formulate programs and policies  more suited to Hong Kong's realities.    With the date 1 July 1997 drawing near, the PWC must step up  its work. To solicit opinions from more Hong Kong people, the  PWC, at the suggestion made by many Hong Kong people, decided to  move the venue for the meetings of the two subgroups from  Beijing to Hong Kong so as to increase exchanges with Hong Kong  people and draw more Hong Kong people into participation in the  preparatory work in the transitional period. This arrangement  once again showed that the PWC was determined to make efforts,  together with Hong Kong people, to achieve Hong Kong's smooth  transition.    The task taken on by the PWC in the second half of the  transitional period is arduous. The spirit displayed by PWC  members in courageously shouldering heavy loads and working hard  is praiseworthy. Anyone who hopes for Hong Kong's smooth  transition will enthusiastically support the PWC in its work and  help overcome contradictions and difficulties arising in the  course of advance. Facts show that more and more people are  doing so.    It should also be pointed out that Chris Patten and a few of  his followers have so far despised the PWC and unscrupulously  belittled the PWC's role and achievements, saying the PWC "lacks  credibility" and "transparency" and describing the mainland PWC  members' trip to Hong Kong to attend meetings and solicit  opinions as "adopting a lofty stance." By bringing such  groundless discredit on the PWC they will in no way impede the  PWC's work, nor will they damage the prestige the PWC has  established among the Hong Kong people. On the contrary, they  will enable more Hong Kong people to see clearly the stubborn  position of Chris Patten, who continues to confront the Chinese  side. They will also awaken Hong Kong people who are unaware of  the truth and the latter will then appreciate and support the  PWC's work. This is Hong Kong's present reality and trend and  nobody will be able to change or resist it.</p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Triple-witching expiry unnerves Dow Wall Street US shares prices retreated yesterday in the face of a sell-off in bonds and a powerful wave of trading related to the triple-witching expiration of futures and options, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 34.56 at 3,776.78, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 3.48 at 458.45. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite receded 1.52 to 440.26, and the Nasdaq slumped 5.62 to 729.35 amid fresh weakness in the technology sector. Although there was no first-tier economic news to drive the market, activity was robust. Investors were busy unwinding positions linked to quarterly options on individual stocks and market indices, and future contracts on the indices. Some 373m shares were exchanged on the NYSE. Trading accelerated in the final hours of the session, as the triple-witching activity tripped a battery of program-guided orders. Declining issues swamped advances 1,405 to 760. Unfortunately for investors, the program trading exaggerated a negative move inspired by plunging bond prices. The benchmark 30-year government security fell nearly a point, as traders reacted nervously to a third consecutive monthly rise in consumer confidence. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index came in at 94.5, compared with 92.8 in May. Bond traders were even more disturbed by a fresh rise in commodity prices and a sharp drop in the value of the dollar against the D-mark. Despite the sour mood in general, there were no strong sectoral trends dragging stocks down. The Dow components were broadly lower, led by cyclical issues. 3M was down Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 50 7/8 , DuPont lost Dollars 1 to Dollars 60 3/8 and International Paper slipped Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 70 3/4 . Boeing was down Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 48 3/8 . Exxon, which shot down and then up during the week, levelled off at Dollars 58 5/8 , finishing with no change on the day. Chevron lost Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 43 1/2 after Smith Barney Shearson downgraded the issue. Relative calm returned to banking stocks after two days of heavy selling. Most issues were down marginally, but First Interstate shed a further Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 75 3/4 and First Chicago fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 49 3/8 . The spotlight yesterday turned to Quaker Oats. The stock jumped Dollars 7 1/4 , or more than 10 per cent, to Dollars 78 5/8 . The gain was struck on speculation that either Nestle or H J Heinz was interested in acquiring the food group. Quaker declined to comment. In semiconductors, Micron Technology dropped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 33 1/2 and Texas Instruments Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 78 1/8 . On the Nasdaq, technology issues came under renewed fire. Lotus Development was marked down Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 51 5/8 , in spite of the announcement that it was buying Softswitch, a communications software supplier. Analysts said the deal was a good strategic move. On the Amex, Cheyenne Software plunged Dollars 8 1/2 or 51.9 per cent to Dollars 7 7/8 after issuing a profits warning. Canada Toronto stocks closed slightly lower in moderate trading, with the TSE 300 composite index down 6.67 in 60.6m shares valued at CDollars 746.8m. Advances and declines were almost even, with advances outpacing declines 361 to 360. Ten of the 14 stock groups ended lower, with the banking sector recording the largest drop of 1.50 per cent. Consumer products and industrial products fell slightly, energy stocks were flat, and mining rose moderately. Golds jumped 2.95 per cent on index. Brazil Equities in Sao Paulo were up 6.72 per cent, helped by active trading ahead of Monday's options settlement. The Bovespa index climbed 2,037 to reach a high for the day of 32,376 in volume of Cr616.7bn (Dollars 266m).</p>

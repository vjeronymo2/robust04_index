			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> WOODEN INJUN LEADS TRAINER GARCIA'S PARADE TO PIMLICO  </P> <P> The "loaded" barn of trainer Carlos Garcia will be in business as usual  Thursday when the 70-day spring meeting begins at Pimlico Race Course.  </P> <P> Garcia, second most successful trainer in the Laurel meet that ended Tuesday,  will saddle the short-priced favorite, Wooden Injun, in the $60,000 Mister Diz  Stakes. The race is a six-furlong sprint for Maryland-bred 3-year-olds.  </P> <P> The colt, bred by owner David Hayden, is among the strong candidates Garcia is  training in several categories of young horses.  </P> <P> Wooden Injun has won his two starts, both stakes, as a 3-year-old. He had two  victories, a second and a third in four starts at age 2.  </P> <P> In his last start, Wooden Injun nosed out his stablemate, Ebonizer, in the  Dancing Count Stakes on Feb. 3.  </P> <P> Wooden Injun is by Baederwood, sire of stakes winners Bea Quality and Miracle  Wood. His dam, Barrera's Charm, is a daughter of Barrera, one of the fastest  sprinters who ever came out of the West.  </P> <P> A son of Raise A Native, named for trainer Laz Barrera by breeder Louis  Wolfson, Barrera broke track records on both coasts. His 1:07 2-5 in the 1977  Premiere Handicap was still the record for six furlongs when the Hollywood Park  course was altered for the 1984 Breeders' Cup. In 1978, at 5, Barrera won the  Tobbogan at Aqueduct in 1:08 4-5, a track record.  </P> <P> Wooden Injun first attracted attention last Aug. 25, when he ran away by 17  lengths in a six-furlong race at Laurel. He led by 10 at the eighth pole and  Kent Desormeaux could have gotten him home sooner than his 1:11 clocking if  necessary.  </P> <P> (Possibly topping that, Garcia has a 3-year-old filly who won her first start  last Saturday by 18 lengths. Pretty Flame, by the good sprinter Mt. Livermore,  went the 6 1/2 furlongs in 1:17 4-5, a second faster than allowance horses had  done it two races earlier.)  </P> <P> One of Wooden Injun's defeats was by Smelly, a Maryland-bred who will head the  field for the $200,000 Federico Tesio at Pimlico Saturday. Smelly left Wooden  Injun seven lengths behind in the seven-furlong Bimelech.  </P> <P> Smelly was a strong second in Gulfstream's Fountain of Youth on March 3. He may  be Maryland's only Triple Crown contender, though trainer Charles Peoples has  hopes for Baron De Vaux, who won the 1 1-16-mile Private Terms at Laurel the  same day.  </P> <P> The 1 1-16-mile Tesio will include a tempting long shot. Trainer Mert Bailes,  who almost never asks too much of his horses, is entering J.R.'s Horizon, who  is eligible for non-winners of two other than maiden.  </P> <P> The son of Jim Ryan's Belmont winner Caveat, J.R.'s Horizon won a 1 1-16-mile  allowance last Friday. In similar races in his previous two starts he was  second to Baron De Vaux by three quarters and to Gala Swinger by a head.  </P> <P> It took J.R.'s Horizon three months and six races to break his maiden, but  lately he seems to be getting the idea. Anyway, he has given Bailes an idea.  </P></p>

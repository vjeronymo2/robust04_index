			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / The costs of closure: FT writers answer the questions arising from the controversy over coal Why is Britain sharply scaling down its coal industry if this will throw tens of thousands out of work and lead to more imports? British Coal has been heavily subsidised - to the tune of Pounds 100m a month, according to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary. He would rather cut British Coal down to a smaller size, even at the risk of boosting imports, because he believes this will bring benefits for the economy as a whole, such as greater efficiency and cheaper electricity. Britain is not the only country to run down its coal industry. Several Continental countries have shut down their mines for good. 2. But isn't British Coal the most efficient producer left in Europe? Yes, by far. It mines coal at a fraction of the price of Germany and Spain, the only two Continental coal producers of any size. But this is irrelevant since prices in the international coal market are dictated by large producing countries including the US, Australia and Colombia. Typical British Coal prices are currently 50 per cent higher than imported coal. In its restructured form British Coal's management believes it could match imported prices within five years. 3. If Spain and Germany believe it is worth paying a price to keep their coal industry, why doesn't the UK? In contrast with those countries, Britain has a wide choice of indigenous fuels, so it is not as tightly locked in to one in particular. It is also questionable whether Spain and Germany will be able to continue subsidising their coal industries under European Community rules. But the fundamental reason is that the UK government believes the price is too great, and produces unacceptable distortions in the energy market. 4. Wouldn't it be cheaper for us to pay the coal miners to go on working? And what effect will this have on our balance of payments? The government will spend Pounds 1bn on coal community aid and redundancy payments, and achieve subsidy savings of Pounds 1.2bn a year, if Mr Heseltine's figures are correct. But the public cost will be much higher if you take into account the ripple effect on unemployment, lost tax revenues and so on. If British Coal is privatised, the Treasury will also have to assume billions of pounds of liabilities for pensions, mine subsidence and free coal for miners. The cost to the Treasury will therefore be substantial. Whether the net result is worth it depends on how far Mr Heseltine's wider benefits materialise. The balance of payments will suffer from a rise in coal imports, though these may not be as big as feared because of the switch out of coal into domestically produced gas. 5. Why do the cuts have to happen now, in the depths of a recession? The timing is dictated by the long-term effects of privatisation of the electricity industry. The electricity generators were privatised on the understanding that when their contracts with British Coal ran out in April 1993, they could renegotiate them on realistic rather than inflated prices. Negotiations on those contracts are now underway, and it is clear that the generators want to take as little British coal as possible because of its high cost. If the government wanted to postpone the colliery closures, it would either have to roll back electricity privatisation, or subsidise the 1993 contracts - neither of which it is prepared to do. 6. Is the National Union of Mineworkers to blame for the closures? Or are Mr Arthur Scargill's dire predictions being proved correct? The effect of the Scargill-led dispute in 1984-85 was to speed up, not slow down, the pace of pit closures. It also helped put back the recent productivity improvements by about two years, thus preventing more pits from reaching an acceptable cost base. Once the die had been cast for electricity privatisation, much of what Mr Scargill had warned about was bound to come true, but that was partly because his own union had undermined the security  -of - supply argument for coal and made it a less attractive fuel for the generators. 7. What is the chance of the closures being stopped? The unions have little industrial leverage, but they hope to raise a sufficient public outcry to frighten the government into reversing its position, as with the poll tax. To that end Mr Scargill has adopted a moderate strategy, eschewing a strike ballot (for now) and talking about the costs to the taxpayer. But this is unlikely to be enough. The best hope for a moratorium comes from Tory backbenchers and the courts. If enough Tory backbenchers vote with Labour for a review of the closures in next Wednesday's debate, they will presumably be stopped for at least a few months. On Thursday the High Court is due to decide whether British Coal abandoned its own colliery review procedure. Tory backbenchers are a better bet than the judges. The government would survive if it was defeated in the debate, but Mr Heseltine may feel obliged to resign because he has become so closely associated with the decisions announced this week. Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade spokesman, says his party's aim is to save the coal mines - not bring down the government. The motion that Labour will draw up for the debate will aim at attracting the maximum number of wavering Conservative MPs. If the government loses, it is likely to table immediately a motion expressing confidence in the government - which it would probably win comfortably. 8. Are we right to be using gas when we have far less of it than coal, and what effect will it have on my electricity bill? There is a great deal of gas in the North Sea - enough to last at least 50 years, so there are no short-term supply problems. The switch to gas is happening partly for commercial reasons, but also because of bad planning in the electricity privatisation. Gas has many advantages over coal: it is cleaner, easier to transport and converts more efficiently into electricity. Gas power stations are also quick and cheap to build, and face fewer planning obstacles. Whether gas produces electricity more cheaply than coal is much disputed because although coal looks cheaper on paper, not all calculations take full account of its heavy environmental costs - which will grow as more green regulations are implemented. Mr Heseltine says the closure of the coal mines will wipe Pounds 300m off electricity bills, but Mr Andrew Horsler, marketing director of British Coal, claims gas-fired stations will add to electricity bills because they will replace coal stations whose costs have already been completely written off, and therefore can produce electricity very cheaply. Another problem is that electricity distribution companies are building gas stations to cut their dependence on supplies from the duopoly of National Power and PowerGen. Present rules allow them to pass the cost straight through to customers so they have no incentive to buy the cheapest fuel. 9. If we abandon all these coal mines now, could we mine the coal again later? British Coal is mothballing four of the 31 collieries listed for closure in case its market revives. But it is costly to keep mines open and these will most likely be shut too unless there is a swift change in coal's fortunes. If, next century, the UK decided to switch back to coal, it would have to build new mines. 10. It sounds as if there are monopolistic practices going on in the electricity industry which are hitting coal unfairly and adding to electricity costs. The National Power/PowerGen duopoly has undoubtedly been able to drive a hard bargain with British Coal, and it has already been threatened with possible monopoly investigation by Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, for trying to influence electricity prices. But Prof Littlechild himself has come under fire from consumers for allegedly failing to ensure that electricity distributors are buying the cheapest possible power when they contract with gas-fired power stations. Some of them have threatened to take him to court. If they win, gas power station deals might have to be unraveled. 11. If the coal cuts go through, will Britain then have achieved the free market in energy which the government wants? No. The nuclear power industry receives Pounds 1.2bn of subsidies a year, though these are being phased out. Nuclear could be in for the British Coal treatment in 1994 when the government plans to review its future. One lesson the nuclear power industry will have learnt this week is that it has only two years to prove that it can stand on its own feet. There are also tight controls on electricity distribution which effectively create regional monopolies. These are also supposed to be phased out over the coming years. A totally free market, if such a thing were possible, is not in sight until the end of this decade. 12. Although the cuts are regrettable, perhaps the run-down of coal is a good thing for the environment? Coal is unquestionably the dirtiest fuel, in terms of the damage caused by mining, transportation, and the emissions at power stations, all of which place extra costs on the economy. It also faces pressure from the government's commitment to an EC target of reducing carbon dioxide emissions to their 1990 levels by the year 2000. If the EC were to introduce a proposed carbon tax, its appeal would be further reduced. Technology does exist to burn coal more cleanly, and it is being introduced at power stations. But it is expensive and reduces the efficiency of the fuel. 13. Will anyone want to buy what's left of the coal industry? Should Sid buy shares? In its truncated form, there is a realistic chance that British Coal can operate profitably. The company was in the black last year, and prospects exist for further productivity gains to meet the tougher terms of the new electricity contracts. At the moment, British Coal is more likely to be sold to another company than floated on the stock exchange as was British Gas. Some half-dozen large companies have expressed an interest, including Hanson, owner of one of the largest US coal companies. There are also two buy-out proposals by trade unions. But if none of these come about, British Coal could be sold to stock market investors. In world terms, it would be a minor coal company with moderate profits at best. World energy supplies are plentiful for the foreseeable future so, barring upheavals, the price of coal is unlikely to show a sharp increase.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency also believed it necessary to identify compliance provisions for the work practice standards because significant emission reductions will be achieved through the work practice standards. Obviously, direct measurement of emissions is not appropriate because emission points being controlled by work practices are not point sources that emit through a stack. All of the recordkeeping associated with work practices is required by the proposed rule to be included in the Work Practice Implementation Plan. The Agency believed that the least complicated way to ensure continuous compliance would be to require a semiannual compliance certification that states that the Work Practice Implementation Plan is being followed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Compliance certifications submitted on a semiannual basis are required for a source that uses compliant materials or an averaging approach, and for a source demonstrating compliance with the Work Practice Implementation Plan. These compliance certifications are analogous to the compliance certification required by the parts 70 and 71 operating permit programs. Therefore, the compliance certification required by these proposed standards are consistent with other regulatory actions that may also apply to the affected source.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> H. Selection of Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In discussing the reporting and recordkeeping requirements, the Committee agreed on the types of records required and the reporting frequency it considered appropriate for this source category. As with the compliance and monitoring requirements, the Committee focused solely on the general information that should form the basis of the reporting and recordkeeping requirements. The Agency has developed a specific regulatory framework identifying reporting and recordkeeping requirements that builds on the general principles agreed to by the Committee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The General Provisions (subpart A) to part 63 include general reporting and recordkeeping requirements that apply to sources for which a NESHAP has been developed, or will be developed, pursuant to section 112 of the Act. The requirements of the General Provisions, in conjunction with the Committee's decisions, form the basis for the reporting and recordkeeping provisions of the proposed rule. A summary of these provisions is provided in Table 6.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For sources using control devices, all of the reporting and recordkeeping requirements of the General Provisions apply. The General Provisions are particularly directed to sources that are using a control device, and that will therefore be conducting an initial performance test and performing traditional emission or process parameter monitoring. As such, for sources that are using compliant coatings or an averaging approach to demonstrate compliance with the proposed rule, some sections of the General Provisions do not apply. Table 6 summarizes those sections of the General Provisions requiring reporting or recordkeeping and identifies whether all sources are subject to the section or just sources using control devices. (For a discussion of the relationship between the proposed rule and the General Provisions in their entirety, see section VI.K.) Sources using compliant materials or an averaging approach to comply with the proposed standards must keep records of finishing material usage, the VHAP content, in kg  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> VHAP/kg solids (lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied, of each finishing material, thinner, and adhesive subject to the emission limits in &sect;63.802; the VOC content, in kg VOC/kg solids (lb VOC/lb solids), as applied, of each strippable booth coating; and the CPDS for finishing materials, cleaning materials, adhesives, thinners, and strippable booth coatings subject to regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Small Business Considerations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because of the large number of small businesses that could potentially be impacted by regulation of the wood furniture industry, the Committee considered carefully the impact of each aspect of the proposed standards on small businesses. The Committee included two small wood furniture manufacturers and a representative of a trade association consisting primarily of small businesses. A Small Business Work Group was formed to specifically address small business issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

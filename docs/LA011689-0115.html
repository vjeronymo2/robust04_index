			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FORD TO MAKE SIERRA IN BELGIUM  </P> <P>  -- Ford Motor Co. Ltd. said today it plans to switch production of its Sierra  model from Britain to Belgium as part of its strategy to prepare for the single  European market in 1992.  </P> <P> The gradual production switch is expected to cut 500 jobs in Dagenham,  northeast of London, and create 2,000 jobs in Genk, Belgium, over the next five  years, said a Ford spokesman. The moves will strengthen the company's ability  to meet anticipated increases and variations in demand by 1992, when the Common  Market is to become one barrier-free marketplace of 320 million consumers, Ford  said.  </P> <P> Dagenham, which employs 8,300 auto workers, will concentrate on the new Fiesta  model, to be introduced in the spring, with production to be increased to match  the current combined output of Sierras and Fiestas of 1,100 a day.  </P></p>

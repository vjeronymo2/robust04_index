			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Sao Paulo - city on a boom-bust roller-coaster ride: Once the magnet for all types of talent, it represents the fading dream of a Great Brazil CUTTING through the heart of Sao Paulo, South America's largest city, the Avenida Paulista is home to the headquarters of most of Brazil's banks, important companies and multinationals, and controls around 39 per cent of the country's GDP. Recently commemorating a century of existence, the 'Paulista's' jumble of concrete skyscrapers, architectural masterpieces, and opulent mansions built by the coffee barons who constructed the road bears witness to the development of the Brazilian economy; its mood acts as a barometer on the prevailing economic situation. Some call it Brazil's 'island of the First World', a magnet for wealth and talent and a symbol of what Brazil could be: for others, like President Fernando Collor, it is a focus of all that is wrong with the country. He sees it as a notorious den of cartels and monopolies blocking his every attempt towards introducing a competitive economy, and peopled with businessmen who, he claims, 'feed their cows with beer and imported lettuce'. The main target of Mr Collor's wrath lies at No. 1313. The powerful Sao Paulo Federation of Industries (FIESP) prospered from the import substitution policy begun in the 1950s and was, in the boom years of the 1970s, the main engine of growth for Latin America. Today, frequently at loggerheads with the Collor government, it houses many 'dinosaurs' eager not to allow intruders into what remains one of the world's most protected economies. The most common FIESP weapon against the government is to warn of widescale dismissals and impending social crisis. With Brazil in its worst recession for a decade, officials are currently threatening mass lay-offs provoked by the government's tight monetary policy (in effect since September) on top of last year's 8 per cent drop in employment. FIESP's lobbying force is, like Brazil's industrialisation, relatively recent. Today's Paulista, along which 130,000 cars hurtle per hour and digital pollution monitors read 'BAD' two-thirds of the year, is very different to the magnolia-lined avenue hewn out of the jungle for the coffee baron society to perambulate in their carriages. Yet until only 40 years ago, coffee barons were the country's most powerful people, coffee comprising 70 per cent of Brazil's exports. And Brazil was a society which imported almost everything. Coffee brought commerce, and names on the road's buildings such as Crespi and Matarozzo register the business success of immigrants who came to Brazil between 1885 and 1914 in a great global migration from Europe and Asia to the New World. More than half the city's population are descended from immigrants, but the deterioration in the economy means nowadays that there are long queues at the Italian and Japanese embassies of second- or third-generation descendants wanting to return to their home countries. The most recent wave of entrants to the Paulista were banks - more than 120 of them. Housed in some of the most impressive buildings, banks above anything have prospered in the last decade of chronic inflation and now represent around 15 per cent of GDP - double that of an average industrialised economy. Recently, they have been unusually calm. 'Some weeks we're Ethiopia, others we're Switzerland. For the last three months we've been Switzerland but now we're heading back to Ethiopia,' says one banker working on the Paulista. He was referring to the fact that the 'agio', the difference between the black market dollar rate and the official rate, and which is usually taken as a monitor of confidence in the economy, is back up to 10 per cent after four months at zero. The disappearance of the 'agio' in December for the first time in 11 years was less a sign that the Brazilian economy is truly on the road to stability and more a result of the government's credit crunch. Maintaining the world's highest interest rates is forcing Brazilians to sell their dollars from under the mattress or bring in some of the estimated Dollars 50bn (Pounds 28.2bn) they hold abroad in order to pay suppliers and workers. These days even the banks are unsmiling as the high interest rates push many of their clients into insolvency - more in 1991 than in the previous two (also recessive) years combined. Gloomier still are the Paulista's shops where shelves remain stocked high and shoppers are few, frightened off by credit costing 5,000 per cent a year. Pressure is mounting on Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, Brazil's economy minister, to relax the monetary policy. 'We are killing off our industry,' warns Mr Emerson Kapaz, a Sao Paulo business leader and toy manufacturer. On the Paulista's pavement, the informal economy seems to be doing little better. The preponderance of street traders selling everything from sink plungers to electronic games show the increase this decade in the informal economy. Thought to be equivalent to 50 per cent of Gross Domestic Product, it is currently exercising the brains of those in government over how to tax it. The last decade left other marks on the Paulista: these days, shoppers clutch handbags and watch out for well-armed pickpockets who shoot for brandname sneakers while motorists drive bullet-proof cars, wary of kidnappers out for more lucrative targets. Ragged children roam the street offering to guard cars for a handful of almost worthless notes, a glaring example of how inflation has increased the gap between rich and poor - the world's widest. As dusk falls on the most expensive real estate in Latin America, gangs of street children cluster round the bin outside Macdonald's hoping for scraps. These were the people that Mr Collor referred to as the "shirtless and shoeless' in his campaign two years ago and pledged to lift out of poverty, while promising those inside the bullet-proof cars to take Brazil into the First World. Now, after a second year of recession and expecting 1992 to be little better in growth, even the Paulista is starting to show the strain. The days of new construction are forgotten and the lack of investment evident in the poor upkeep of the greying buildings. Once a magnet for talent from all over the world, the cracked pavements of the Avenida Paulista now attract down-and-outs from the country's poverty-stricken north-east. And symbolise the fading dreams of a Great Brazil.</p>

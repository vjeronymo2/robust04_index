			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Israeli troops alerted for reprisals Troops in Israel's south Lebanon security zone and along the international border were placed on heightened alert yesterday, after Lebanese Moslem militants threatened to avenge the kidnapping by Israel of Mustapha Dirani, leader of the pro-Iranian 'Faithful Resistance' guerrilla movement. Mr Dirani was seized from his home in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley early on Saturday morning, in what Israel's army chief of staff, Lt-Gen Ehud Barak, described as an 'impeccably executed' commando operation. The army's intelligence chief, Maj-Gen Uri Saguy, said Mr Dirani had 'already provided some answers to questions we've been asking for a long time'; other military sources said that he was proving 'a tough nut to crack' and that his interrogation would continue for several weeks. The guerrilla leader, whose movement is linked to the pro-Iranian Hizbollah group, is alleged by Israel to have taken prisoner an Israeli air force navigator, Ron Arad, who bailed out of his Phantom jet over Lebanon in October 1986. The Israelis claim Mr Dirani held Mr Arad captive for two years, then sold him to a contingent of Iranian Revolutionary Guards for Dollars 300,000 (Pounds 200,000). Israel's Prime Minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, said the Dirani kidnap had been planned for months and that he hoped the Shia militia leader would be able to provide information on Mr Arad's whereabouts. He added that Israel decided on the operation after repeated appeals to Syria, via the US, for details of Mr Arad had failed to produce results. He said Israel did not intend to use Mr Dirani as a bargaining chip, having learned from experience that trying to arrange such details was futile. While Hizbollah vowed to 'expand the scope of fighting' against Israel in response to the kidnapping, and other Islamic militant sources threatened 'spectacular retaliation', Israeli politicians from across the spectrum came out overwhelmingly in support of the operation. Israeli troops killed at least one alleged Islamic militant and captured two others when raiding a house in the West Bank town of Hebron yesterday.</p>

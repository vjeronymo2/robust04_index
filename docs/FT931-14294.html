			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: More Brazilian iron ore deals agreed BRAZIL'S Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the world's leading exporter of iron ore, has reached an agreement that will cut the price paid by Japanese steel mills by between 11 and 12 per cent. Japan is the largest market for the state-owned company's ore production, accounting for about 19m tonnes of the company's 60.4m tonnes of exports last year. The price reductions are similar in scale to those contained in an agreement with German producers announced last week. The company suggested that they would set the pattern for its prices for the rest of Europe. High grade northern sinter material, from the Carajas site, will be supplied at Dollars 18.15 a tonne and southern sinter at Dollars 16.90 a tonne. Prices for pellets will be renegotiated under a separate accord. The German deal included a price reduction for pellets from Dollars 31 to Dollars 28 a tonne. CVRD's existing contract with the Japanese mills will remain in effect until its scheduled expiry in April. A company official said that the early renegotiation was 'completely atypical'. The company also revealed that producers in the UK and Italy will enjoy similar price reductions.</p>

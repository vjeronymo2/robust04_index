			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: Alexander &amp; Alexander in moves to replace chief Non-executive directors of Alexander &amp; Alexander have acted to replace Mr Tinsley Irvin, the US insurance brokers' long-time chairman and chief executive, after a succession of mishaps and disappointing results at the group. Mr Irvin has stepped down immediately as chairman and will be replaced as chief executive once a replacement from outside the group has been found. The move follows a special board meeting on Friday to consider the management of the group. Mr Irvin said he and the board had agreed that 'significant changes in leadership' were necessary 'in order to accelerate the pace of change and effect improvements in operations and earnings.' He added: 'Some of the old ways we do business must also change.' Two months ago, Alexander &amp; Alexander, the world's second-largest insurance broker after Marsh &amp; McLennan, restated earnings back to 1991 when it discovered that its Alexander Consulting Group arm had been overstating its revenues. Earlier last year, the group had to take a special Dollars 157.5m charge to cover indemnity costs related mainly to a business it had sold some years previously. Mr Robert Boni, a former chairman of Armco, the steel company, has taken over as chairman and will head a committee of non-executive directors charged with finding a new chief executive for the group. Efforts would be made to lift the company's revenues, cut its costs and improve organisation controls, Mr Boni said. He paid tribute to the accomplishments Mr Irvin had achieved, adding that he had brought the company through a turbulent period. Mr Irvin became chief executive in 1987, as the US broker was recovering from fraud losses it suffered in Alexander Howden, the Lloyd's insurance broker it had acquired in 1982. He became chairman a year later. The company said it would divide these two roles in the future. Alexander &amp; Alexander has suffered from flagging profits in its large US retail insurance broking operations, as well as from a disappointing record from its international acquisitions. These include Alexander Howden and, in 1985, Canadian broker Reed Stenhouse. Mr Irvin, 60, had been with the company since 1953, and will remain a director.</p>

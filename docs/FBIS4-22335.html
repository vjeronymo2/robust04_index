			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by P. Shcherbakov: "We Have the Resolution. We Do </F> Not Have the Fuel"]    [Text] Last week the federation council passed a resolution  on priority measures to secure the fulfillment of spring field  work in the Russian Federation in 1994. The document, which was  signed by V. Shumeyko, is short, consisting of only two points,  but it would be difficult to overestimate its significance. In  it, the federation council proposes that within a two-week  period, the government of the Russian Federation solve the  problem of allocating credit to the agroindustrial complex for  the first six-month period in an amount equalling 6 trillion  rubles, including 3 trillion rubles for the first quarter. In  this way the upper house of the Russian parliament showed itself  to be more generous than the government, which in its recent  resolution on the economic conditions for the functioning of the  APK [Agroindustrial complex] operations in 1994 was able to  allocate only 5 trillion rubles for this purpose. Recall how  many critical barbs the mass media, which considers itself to be  democratic, directed in this regard at the government's deputy  prime minister, A. Zaveryukha, who is responsible for the  agricultural sector. By doing this, they said, the government  was pushing the country into a new inflationary spiral.    Of course it is gratifying that the upper house of  parliament  has finally shown some concern for peasant needs. But the  question immediately arises: Where were you before, respected  deputies? After all, it is well known that the spring day feeds  the year. Well, all right, perhaps before the snow melts the  people of the north will see the effects of this document. But  what about the people of the Kuban, Rostov and Stavropol?  Incidentally, at a point at which the resolution of the  federation council had not yet been signed, the farmers of  Krasnodar Kray, having poured the last liters of fuel into  tractor tanks, were already able to fertilize 200,000 hectares  of winter crops out of a total of 1.5 million hectares. Winter  crops were resown on 20,000 hectares where they had perished  completely or were thin. This work must be done on a total of  300,000 hectares. Will farmers complete it successfully?    It is no accident that on 1 March the new government  commission on spring sowing and harvesting in 1994, chaired by  the RF government's deputy prime minister, A. Zaveryukha, met  for the first time this year. The discussion at the meeting was  very alarming.    Russian agricultural workers must carry out spring sowing on  67.4 million hectares, which is 4 million hectares more than  last year. This can be explained by the fact that last fall for  a number of reasons fewer late-fall plowed fields were raised  and winter crops were not sown on 4 million hectares. In  addition, due to crop loss it is necessary to resow winter crops  on 2 million hectares.    V. Shcherbak, first RF deputy minister of agriculture and  food, noted in his speech that Russia's agricultural enterprises  have somewhat smaller supplies of spring crop seed, especially  corn.    Yet this did not evoke as much concern among commission  members as did the shortage of tractors, agricultural machinery  and spare parts, oil and lubricating materials, mineral  fertilizes and chemical plant protection agents. It is this,  noted the meeting participants, that can seriously affect the  course of spring field work.    As of early February one out of four tractors and trucks and  about one-third of plows, cultivators and sowers were in a state  of disrepair. As for diesel fuel and gasoline reserves in  enterprises, prior to the beginning of the current sowing period  they were significantly smaller than in preceding years.    Specialists confirm that uninterrupted equipment fuel  supplies during spring field work is impossible if enterprises  do not have a diesel fuel and gasoline reserves for at least 25  days. At the present time enterprises have only 350,000 tonnes  of diesel fuel compared to the norm of 1.3 million tonnes.  Operations data from the RF Ministry of Agriculture and Food  confirm that about 30 percent of enterprises have completely  expended their available fuel reserves. One fifth of enterprises  have only a 3-5 day reserve. Especially alarming is the  curtailment of fuel reserves in regions and enterprises located  at a distance from railroad stations because it is impossible to  transport anything during the spring period when roads are bad.    In the opinion of commission members, the situation  involving  supplies of mineral fertilizers, seed-treatment chemicals and  pesticides to enterprises for spring sowing is equally serious.  Even if we supplied enterprises with a minimum quantity of  mineral fertilizer calculated on the basis of 27 kilograms of  active substance per hectare, we would still have a shortage of  2.9 million tonnes of mineral fertilizer. In storehouses the  remainder comprises only 400,000 tonnes. In January-February  enterprises were able to procure another 200,000 tonnes. Thus,  total reserves equal only 21 percent of the minimum needed. Let  me remind you that just 5 years ago kolkhozes and sovkhozes  applied 12.8 million tonnes of fertilizer to the harvest. This  year they probably will not apply even 3.5 million tonnes.    Because of insolvency, village goods producers owe chemical  combines 70 billion rubles. As a result, in order not to stop  production, a significant portion of the fertilizer that is so  needed by agriculture is exported. In order to stop this  negative process even for a short time, the commission has  decided to make a proposal to the government on halting the  export of all forms of mineral fertilizer produced in Russia for  a period of 3 months beginning 10 March of this year.    "Yes, this is not a market solution," noted Deputy Prime  Minister A. Zaveryukha, "but we have no other today. Otherwise,  we will leave the domestic goods producer without fertilizer,  and this means without a harvest."    Commission members have given a great deal of attention to  the financial problems of agriculture and its related branches  of industry and to the deterioration of the system of mutual  accounts and payments. The commission has complained about the  Central Bank and the RF Ministry of Finance concerning the  non-fulfillment, in its opinion, of the government's directives  on the order for issuing credit to village goods producers and  for canceling interest on such credit.    The commission noted a number of specific measures that  would  make serious corrections in the course of preparing for and  carrying out spring sowing.</p>

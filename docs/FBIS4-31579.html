			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Khristo Bardaliev: "Bulgarian Socialist </F> Party Made Painful Step Toward Power"]    [Text] It is no exaggeration to say that the 41st BSP  [Bulgarian Socialist Party] Congress was awaited with interest  not only by society but also by the various parties and  coalitions. The BSP supporters had good reason to expect (and  demand) a clear stance on the current political and economic  crisis. The main opponent of the BSP, the SDS [Union of  Democratic Forces], convened a special session of the National  Coordinating Council to enable it to react immediately to the  congress decisions. The other parliamentary and  extraparliamentary parties impatiently waited for the congress  to end, mostly so that they could reorient themselves regarding  the date of possible early elections and the potential chance of  utilizing the "red" carrier rocket for new parliamentary seats.    Naturally, it is as yet too early to speak of any full and  precise answer to these issues. Nevertheless, the main  tendencies in the development of the BSP can be divined.    The most important thing -- for both the BSP and the whole  of  Bulgarian society -- was that the congress prevented  restorational and nostalgic longings for the "bright past" to  gain the upper hand in its decisions on the BSP program and  statute. The rejection of the draft documents submitted by the  "Marxist Alternative" faction is proof enough of this.    The convincing majority by which Zhan Videnov was reelected  as leader indicates that his views will form the basis of the  parties practical politics in the future. Incidentally, the  conservatives did gain their revenge by preventing a number of  prominent members of the OSD [Alliance for Social Democracy]  from being elected to the Supreme Council -- people like Dimitur  Yonchev, Velislava Dureva, Rosen Karadimov, and Elena  Poptodorova. In this way the provincial delegates showed that  they do not like free thinkers, or perhaps they merely think  that they can thus make room for new deputies in the next  parliament.    Andrey Lukanov's star also faded. Evidently, the accusations  heaped upon him of banking swindles had their effect, or perhaps  he had simply become an embarrassment, being too closely  connected with the former leadership of the Bulgarian Communist  Party, or again, maybe both factors played a part.    Surprisingly, Aleksandur Marinov also met with failure. It  is difficult to say what he paid the price for -- his excessive  personal ambitions or his too close connections with Aleksandur  Lilov.    These personnel changes indicate something of real  importance, namely that the BSP is taking difficult and painful  steps along the road of replacing its dogmatic ideology with  pragmatism. They also show that it already realizes the need to  break out of the magic circle of insider quarrels about the kind  of "social democracy" or "democratic socialism" that mean  nothing in themselves, and is moving toward a specific program  and concrete actions arising therefrom.    The party's specific program and actions will be determined  by the internal balance within the BSP, between the party elite,  linked with young Bulgarian business, and the mood of the party  mass membership, which is dominated by the feelings of the  sections of Bulgarian society with fewest rights -- the  pensioners, peasants, and unemployed.    The BSP can no longer rely on cheap populist ploys,  especially since it has attracted much opprobrium by its support  of the Berov cabinet, support provided in the name of economic  and social stabilization -- hopes that proved illusory.    The renunciation of direct ideologizing is even more  necessary if the party wants to find allies for the upcoming  election duel. The less said about concepts and the more about  the nation's problems, the easier the BSP will find it to  attract more of the better-quality parties and personalities.  This will provide the best answer to the meaningless question:  "Is the BSP changing?"    "He who does not advance loses ground" -- the BSP  headquarters at 20 Pozitano Street has enough historians and  philosophers who are well aware of the truth of this Latin  saying. The question is whether the new leadership will succeed  to turn "the word into flesh," as the Gospel puts it.</p>

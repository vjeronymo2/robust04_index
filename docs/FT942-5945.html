			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / No answers at VAT gripeline An attempt by HM Customs &amp; Excise to boost its caring image ran into embarrassing early difficulties yesterday as the agency tried to unveil details of an initiative designed to show its new-found helpfulness to business. The department said that from Monday companies would be able to gripe over the telephone about their concerns in handling value added tax. But in an omen of things to come, the agency said yesterday that it was unable to provide further information such as the number or type of calls it expected to receive because all the relevant officials were out of the office. After failing to raise any officials yesterday an exasperated press officer said: 'I think they took advantage of the bank holiday and are not back yet.' The 'business-views hotline' will be open for three months for ideas on ways to make VAT more 'user-friendly for business'. Businesses hoping for proof that Customs staff are human will be disappointed - the service will be in the form of recorded messages. The department hopes that businesses will use the telephone to make recommendations on improvements to the VAT system. Last month consultants completed a survey of 1,000 businesses for Customs &amp; Excise to judge how it could improve its quality of service, fulfil its commitments and keep compliance requirements to a minimum. One piece of good news is that rather than try to cash in on the premium-rate charges often levied on recorded messages, the department has arranged for calls to be free, on 0800 132384.</p>

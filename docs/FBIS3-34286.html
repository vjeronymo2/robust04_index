[Dallul] The summit of U.S. President Bill Clinton and  Syrian  Arab President Hafiz al-Asad was mainly based on the integration  between the Lebanese and Syrian tracks. Furthermore, I say that  this summit--and there is no illusion in what I say--is the  result of this physical integration of the Lebanese-Syrian  level, and the coordination and consultation with the Jordanian  track. This integration of the Arab tracks, despite the  deviation of Palestinian brothers from the semi-Arab consensus,  forced all who deal with the dossier of the Middle East  negotiations to follow a distinguished new approach with the  Arab parties directly concerned with the negotiations.    In other words, the steadfastness of the Syrian and Lebanese  front, and to some extent, the steadfastness of the Jordanian  front, have been the basis of the political developments that  were crowned by the Clinton-al-Asad summit in Geneva.    All those concerned with the Middle East negotiations on all  levels became aware that the political breakthrough they made on  the Arab tracks, and precisely through the Gaza-Jericho  agreement, was not enough to make a settlement, even a distorted  one, on the Palestinian track itself, so how can this be the  case with the other tracks? The deformed agreement that is  called the Gaza-Jericho agreement does not represent even a  small portion of the Palestinian people's aspirations, so how  can this be the case with our Arab nation's aspirations for  comprehensive, just, and real peace?    Briefly, I say we and Syria have not been apart in very  serious circumstances. Therefore, we will not be apart today  after we reaped together the result of our steadfastness and  integration.    [Faqih] How will the positive atmosphere be translated on  the  negotiations table? Are there assurances on pressuring Israel  in order to advance the Lebanese and Syrian tracks?    [Dallul] Our only assurance for employing pressure on Israel  is through continued integration of the Lebanese and Syrian  tracks. This is the only guarantee for reaching a just and  honorable solution. Some quarters tried to ignore or even to  delay negotiations with Syria and Lebanon, and some  international and regional forces tried to undermine the size of  Syria and Lebanon in the settlement. They also tried to inflate  the size of the Gaza- Jericho agreement in order to overshadow  the whole cause, but we, on the Lebanese side as well as on the  Syrian side, stressed that Palestine is an Arab cause,  therefore, it concerns all Arabs, and no party, whoever they  might be, has the right to say that this cause is his particular  cause or his area, in which he deals in the manner he deems  appropriate.    [Faqih] What is the role of the U.S. full partner?    [Dallul] We have no illusions about this. The U.S. partner  has declared its full bias to Israel. During the main phases of  the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the United States  financed and even supported all Israel's wars against the Arabs.  Furthermore, it provided an international and political cover  for the Zionist state. But I speak now about the U.S. interest  in all of this, and in this particular stage. Now the United  State is the sole superpower in the international political  arena, therefore, what interest do the American people have in  antagonizing Arabs, who have huge human and economic  capabilities? What interest does the United States have in  supporting Israeli aggressions against Lebanon, for instance? I  ask this question about U.S. interests, and I do not find  convincing answers that call for continued U.S. adoption of the  aggressive Israeli policy. Therefore, I assume that the United  States is heading for a change in its alliances. I do not have  facts indicating any major change in this field, but what is  needed is to deal with the Arab-Israeli conflict with some  objectivity.    [Faqih] Does Lebanon still stick to its position not to  participate in multilateral negotiations unless progress was  realized in the bilateral negotiations?    [Dallul] Lebanon still sticks to this point in particular  and  refuses to participate in the multilateral negotiations. We do  not have any other formula for negotiations other than the  current formula.    [Faqih] Suppose Israel proposed a joint committee with  Lebanon in exchagne for a commitment to comply with UN Security  Council Resolution 425? How would you react? How do you  envisage the work of such a committee? Will you approve of the  security arrangements? What role would the Lebanese Army play?  And what will become of Hizballah and the resistance and the  South Lebanese Army [SLA] ?    [Dallul] Resolution 425 provides for an Israeli pullout from  the occupied Arab territories not linked to security  arrangements or a military committee with the Israeli enemy.  Lebanon has publicly rejected any security arrangements with  Israel. We have made our rejection of any joint military  committee known as well.    The Lebanese Army is now set to deploy in all Lebanese  territories, including those under Israeli occupation. As for  the weapons in the hands of Hizballah and the resistance, the  areas where the Lebanese military deploys will be off limits to  any other weapons. As for what you call the SLA, we have never  recognized it. For us, it is outside national legitimacy. We  will deal with it accordingly.    [Faqih] Assuming Antoine Lahd recognized the l-Ta'if accord  and the SLA surrendered their weapons to the state, is it  possible that it would end up the way other militias did? Would  the other parties and forces agree to absorb some 3,000 agents?    [Dallul] There is no comparison between the SLA and other  Lebanese militias. These militias have fought each other for  many years and for a variety of reasons, each adhering to what  it viewed as its own princples. But none of these have strayed  outside their Lebanese fold, or sold out to the devil the way  the SLA have. In any case, Lebanon has its judicial and legal  authorities that will decide the way to handle the SLA.    [Faqih] Has a link been established between Israel and the  recent explosions in al-Sayfi and the attempt on the life of the  Lebanese president? Don't you think such leaks are detrimental  to Lebanon's credibility?    [Dallul] In criminology, we first look for who stands to  gain most from a crime. In the case of a homeland, the evidence  is usually more conclusive and damning. Lebanon is going  through a state of growth and recuperation, and is emerging from  a terrible civil war. There are ongoing attempts to restore  credibility in Lebanon, with powerful forces working in the  opposite direction. If the military confrontations are over,  there is still a more ferocious battle that we have to fight,  and that is the struggle for peace in Lebanon, for the Lebanese  people's civilizing, cultural, democratic, and economic roles.    The rehabilitation effort is attended by compelling and  destructive circumstances, pressure, and siege on all sides. In  our battle for peace our weapons are not that many. The only  weapon we have is the will and determination to build.    There are attempts to undermine the confidence we are  seeking  to restore to Lebanon's security and economy and to kill the  saplings before they put forth their leaves, with the object of  wrecking all that we have built and scrapping the al-Ta'if  agreement.    [Faqih] Who will benefit from this?    [Dallul] The crime leads to the criminal. In any case, it is  not far removed from Israel, although the direct perpetrator is  not necessarily an Israeli.    [Faqih] Will the negative stands affect the pope's visit to  Lebanon? Can the Lebanese security organs protect the pope?    [Dallul] There were no negative stands regarding the pope's  expected visit to Lebanon. Some political sides declared  political stands regarding this visit and expressed their desire  that the Vatican maintains a balanced policy vis-a-vis the  Middle East issue. However, there were no negative stands in the  full sense of the word.    With regard to the capability of the Lebanese organs to  protect the pope, it is certain that our organizations can  provide such protection with efficiency. Those who can protect  the entire homeland can protect its guests, even if the guest is  the pope.    [Faqih] Is the Syrian presence in Lebanon subject to  discussion?    [Dallul] There is no such problem as the Syrian presence in  Lebanon. This presence came in response to an official and  popular legitimate Lebanese request to confront the plot against  Lebanon and the Lebanese. This presence contributed in a basic  fashion to stability in Lebanon and to reaching this situation.    I say this presence was a solution, not a problem; it was a  solution that stopped the bloodshed and brought an end to the  fire that was spreading to every street, house, and village in  Lebanon. This presence created a suitable atmosphere to lay down  the bases of peace.    [Faqih] If Israel withdraws all its forces from southern  Lebanon, can the Lebanese Army, with its limited capabilities,  control the entire border and prevent infiltrations and fedayeen  operations that would renew tension on the borders?    [Dallul] First, I would like to assert that the Lebanese  Army  can protect the Lebanese borders with its capabilities, which we  are trying to develop. The capabilities of the Lebanese Army  are not as limited as some people might think. This army stood  up in the face of the recent Israeli aggressions and resisted  them, with its available potentials -- with its hands, weapons,  and determination. The army's determination is an important  weapon. The decision of steadfastness and fighting is the most  important weapon. Yes, this army can protect the Lebanese  borders. With regard to the fedayeen operations, these  operations are launched because dear parts of our land are still  under Israeli occupation. So, when this occupation ends, there  will be no need for fedayeen operations.    [Faqih] It has been reported recently that there will be  government change or reshuffle following the Geneva summit?    [Dallul] Why should there be a change or a reshuffle  following the Geneva summit? I see no reason for this, although  the possibility of a government change in Lebanon exists under  less important circumstances. This government will be changed  when the reasons for its continuation have ended. This is not  an important issue. People are not as important as the policy  of the government or the general outlines governing its trends.</p>

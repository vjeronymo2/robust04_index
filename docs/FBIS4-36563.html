			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Adnan Husayn: "Iraqi Opposition Stresses </F> Situation in Kurdistan Under Control"]    [Excerpts] London -- An Iraqi opposition official has  stressed that the situation in Iraqi Kurdistan is now under  control after a month of armed conflict over power between the  Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP], led by Mas'ud Barzani, and the  Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK], led by Jalal Talabani. The  conflict resulted in the deaths of at least 600 ordinary  citizens from the two sides.    Dr. Ahmad al-Jalabi, head of the [Unified] Iraqi National  Congress Executive Bureau, told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT over the  telephone yesterday from his residence in the city of Salah  al-Din in north Iraq that "life has returned to normal" in most  Kurdish areas since the meeting held last Sunday between Barzani  and Talabani. [passage omitted]    Asked about the clashes that broke out the day before  yesterday in the Qal'at Dizah and Halabjah areas near the border  with Iran, al-Jalabi said that the National Congress, which has  been entrusted with the task of disengaging the warring  militias, sent forces belonging to it to these areas yesterday  "to disengage the forces and prevent fighting from breaking out  between them."    PUK (Talabani) sources accused joint forces of the KDP  (Barzani) and Kurdish Islamic organizations, which are accused  of collaborating with Iran and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard,  of attacking PUK positions in these areas. But sources from  Barzani's party have denied that the KDP forces participated in  these clashes, which they said took place between "PUK forces  and Islamic Movement forces only."    AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that a tripartite meeting  bringing together leaders from Barzani's party, Talabani's  party, and the Islamic Movement was held yesterday in Irbil to  discuss ways of stopping the clashes in the border areas.

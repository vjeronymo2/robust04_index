			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / S Africa's blacks get the vote: Deal on majority rule constitution ends 350 years of white oppression SOUTH AFRICA last night adopted a majority rule constitution, effectively bringing to an end 350 years of white minority oppression and giving blacks the vote for the first time. 'We have reached the end of an era . . . millions who were not allowed to vote, will do so. I, too, for the first time in my short life, will vote,' said Mr Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress leader and the man widely expected to become the country's next president. Mr FW de Klerk, the South African president and the man whose vision and reforms made the new constitution possible, will remain in charge until next April's general election when the new constitution will take effect. He heralded the document as the 'distillation of the dreams of generations of disenfranchised South Africans'. Weary negotiators reached agreement on the historic 158-page document late last night after years of negotiation. The process was set in train when government ministers met Mr Nelson Mandela in the months preceding his release from jail in 1990, after 27 years in detention for opposing the racist state. The constitution will remain in force for up to five years and is based on traditional western values which contrast sharply with apartheid, one of the most repressive regimes in history. It guarantees multi-party democracy, equality before the law, fundamental human rights and freedoms, an independent judiciary and a free press. Mr Matthew Phosa, the ANC's constitutional negotiator, said the 21 parties which agreed the constitution had dug 'the grave for apartheid'. Mr Roelf Meyer, the government's chief negotiator, shocked delegates to the negotiating council when he announced that the government had agreed to a very weak form of multiracial power-sharing, a capitulation by the ruling National party. All parties with more than 5 per cent of the vote will be granted a seat in cabinet in a government of national unity, with two deputy presidents to be chosen from the two top parties. The president will be elected by the national assembly. But the new constitution has powerful opponents, among them the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and the white right wing, led by retired army general Constand Viljoen. They form the so-called 'Freedom Alliance' which poses a substantial threat to the stability of the government which will emerge after elections on April 27 next year. Mr de Klerk has left open the possibility that the Alliance may ratify the constitution after it has been adopted by the other 21 parties, but this seemed increasingly unlikely. Concessions were made to the Alliance in last night's debate, including allowing regions to write their own constitutions and requiring a two-thirds majority of the regional house of assembly, the senate, to change the powers of regions. But these did not appear sufficient to bring the Alliance back on board. With a low-level civil war already raging in Natal province between Inkatha and the ANC, and with the right wing heavily armed and well trained, the two could prevent elections altogether unless they are accommodated. The president will try for a consensus, but will have the final say where this is not possible.

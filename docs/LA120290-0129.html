			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. TROOP CUTS KNOCKED AWRY BY GULF CRISIS  </P> <P> The massive Persian Gulf military buildup will make it all but impossible for  the Pentagon to carry out the first round of personnel cuts mandated by  Congress as part of a five-year plan to shrink the armed forces by 25%, defense  officials said Saturday.  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is ready to inform Congress that the requirements  of Operation Desert Shield probably will force a delay in this year's personnel  reductions, sources said. He is expected to seek authorization to defer the  cuts until later years.  </P> <P> The Persian Gulf deployment is placing the heaviest demands on the U.S. Army,  which had been expected to cut 40,000 uniformed personnel by the end of 1991 --  or half the overall 80,000 reduction approved by Congress for the fiscal year  that began Oct. 1.  </P> <P> The probable need to delay the 1991 round of reductions -- and the savings they  would have produced -- is the first concrete evidence that Operation Desert  Shield will soak up much of the initial "peace dividend" generated by warming  East-West relations.  </P> <P> Advisers have told Cheney that the gulf deployment, which is expected to reach  430,000 troops by mid-January, will require the Pentagon to restructure its  five-year personnel reduction plan and persuade lawmakers to ease their demands  for this year's reductions.  </P> <P> Defense officials said it became clear in late November that the Pentagon would  be unable to meet the personnel reductions mandated by Congress as part of an  effort to reduce future defense spending in response to a declining Soviet  threat.  </P> <P> At that time, Cheney approved an Army proposal to halt departures of soldiers  whose terms of duty had expired and officers who had elected to retire. His  action will prevent the sidelining of as many as 3,500 Army soldiers each  month.  </P> <P> The Army recently concluded that even under the most favorable circumstances,  it could reduce its forces by no more than 20,000 this year. In the worst case  -- a protracted war or a prolonged stalemate -- the service has told Cheney it  would be unable to trim its rolls at all.  </P> <P> "A sharp drawdown in strength in the last half or quarter of the year would  destroy Army readiness," said one Pentagon source.  </P> <P> Cheney had planned to cut the Army's personnel roster to 580,000 in 1996 from  the current level of 750,000. The cuts would be part of an overall plan to  eliminate a quarter of America's 2.1 million active-duty armed forces personnel  over five years.  </P> <P> "The services are very antsy about their ability to meet their end-strength  reductions," said a senior defense official, who noted that Cheney may ask  Congress as early as Monday to give the services some leeway in making the  reductions this year.  </P> <P> Army officials said almost three-quarters of the service's active-duty manpower  is deployed abroad, in Europe as well as the Middle East, causing more turmoil  in the ranks than at any time since the Army shifted to voluntary recruitment  in 1973.  </P> <P> The Marine Corps, with two-thirds of its troops slated for deployment in the  Persian Gulf by late January and almost 80% assigned somewhere overseas, also  has instituted a program to stop the loss of some personnel.  </P> <P> But officials said that even with the added strains, the Marines expect to be  able to meet their first-year personnel reduction goal of 3,000 by Sept. 30,  1991, the end of the fiscal year. Under Cheney's plan, the Corps would shrink  to 175,000 by 1996 from about 200,000 now.  </P> <P> Navy officials already have argued that they will be hard-pressed to maintain  six carrier battle groups, totaling hundreds of U.S. warships, while  simultaneously retiring ships and sailors as directed by Congress.  </P> <P> The personnel reductions are part of overall defense spending cuts proposed by  Cheney that would trim Pentagon outlays by 10% over the next five years. Those  plans were devised before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and the resulting  U.S. military buildup.  </P> <P> The current U.S. deployment of about 240,000 troops is costing the government  the equivalent of $17 billion a year, and the amount is expected to almost  double when the recently announced buildup is completed in January.  </P></p>

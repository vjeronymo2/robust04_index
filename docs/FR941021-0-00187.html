			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 213.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We will not impose a global band sharing plan on U.S. licensees at this time. The four parties to the Joint Proposal have not given any justification for doing so, and one applicant specifically opposes the imposition of such a plan. We have no evidence on the record before us of imminent coordination conflicts among the applicants beyond U.S. borders. Neither is it clear at present that operating constraints designed to accommodate our domestic licensees will provide either necessary or effective in other jurisdictions. Perhaps most importantly, we do not believe it is appropriate for the United States to impose global band sharing restrictions, that directly impact the ability of other countries to access these systems as they see fit, absent indications from these countries regarding their planned use of these frequency bands. Accordingly, we will not mandate a band sharing scheme to be followed beyond U.S. borders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. EC Concerns  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 214. The Delegation of the European Commission (EC) is concerned that the proposals in the Notice are based purely upon domestic U.S. interests despite the global nature of the proposed systems and services. Specifically, the EC alleges that the Notice: (1) Fails to take into account proposed non-U.S. or future systems, their access to the U.S. market and use of spectrum in the U.S.; (2) indicates an intention to extend Section 310 restrictions to the proposed systems inhibiting potential European investment; (3) advances trade and industrial policy arguments underlining the importance of the proposed systems to the U.S. economy and U.S. leadership; (4) proposes unilateral solutions to orbit, frequency and coverage issues that are global in nature; (5) fails to discuss requirements to effect the satisfactory application of Resolutions 46 and 70 of WARC&hyph;92; and (6) fails to address issues related to the 2 GHz band. The EC states that the regulatory approach that we proposed raises global regulatory and trade issues and that the U.S. should not proceed with its domestic licensing process until it consults with foreign administrations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 215. We agree that the proposed systems have international ramifications. Many of these are or will be addressed in appropriate international fora and in ITU satellite coordination activities. Others may be appropriate for bilateral consultations of the nature sought by the EC. However, we do not agree that the U.S. domestic licensing process must await final resolution of these issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 216. We find delaying the U.S. licensing process is unacceptable. Delaying our regulatory process would delay the improved communications and economic growth that Big LEO services will create. These benefits would be developed both for citizens of the United States and all other countries that may choose to participate in rendering these services. Such a delay would also harm developing countries by limiting their opportunity to improve their communications infrastructure. The uncertainty associated with delay could also adversely impact the viability of the proposed systems in the financial markets and the ability of the applicants to attract additional investors. U.S. applicants have already invested significant resources in research and development, satellite design, marketing and participation in ITU meetings and conferences. Even if the United States were to delay its licensing process, it is unclear how the EC proposes to resolve the issues it has identified, resulting in open-ended delay. Further, the EC's criticism of our proposals is not accompanied by recommendations. Indeed, it is not clear that the EC is yet in a position to speak authoritatively for its member countries. We do not believe that an indefinite delay in the U.S. regulatory process under such circumstances is warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 217. It is also clear that we do not need to delay the domestic licensing proceeding until international agreements are finalized. Regardless of our domestic decisions, each administration will retain the right to license gateway earth stations and mobile earth stations needed to provide service. In addition, U.S. licensees will be subject to ITU recommendations and coordination procedures. Further, the United States is working with the ITU Radio Communications sector to develop standards applicable to LEO systems. However, we seek to leave system design and service offerings to the licensees as much as possible in order to encourage technological innovation, to promote rapid implementation of Big LEO services and to maximize consumer choice. Therefore it is in the interest of the United States government and U.S. system operators to seek globally acceptable standards and we will strive to do so. We disagree with the EC that we are not taking into account projects envisaged outside the United States and future global systems that might use the spectrum. In the Notice, we noted that all U.S. satellite systems are subject to ITU coordination procedures. <FOOTCITE>307</FOOTCITE>  Thus, U.S.-licensed operators are required to coordinate their proposed systems with countries whose existing services, or whose possible future MSS systems, might be affected. Regardless of the spectrum licensing arrangement within the United States, we would work with affected administrations to resolve any spectrum sharing or technical issues. Further, we are not precluding access to the U.S. market. We believe, however, that subject is more appropriately handled through bilateral discussions (as the EC contemplates) and the ITU coordination process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 307 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Notice, not 2,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> at para. 91.  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of International Hotels (2): Forget the rudimentaries  -Paul Taylor investigates developments to attract the business traveller Advances in portable computing and mobile telecommunications over the past decade mean that many business travellers now arrive in the hotel lobby carrying a shoulder-bag of high tech gadgets including notebook PC, modem and perhaps even a cellular telephone. Large hotel chains on both sides of the Atlantic recognise that many guests are no longer satisfied with rudimentary centralised business facilities such as front desk telex machines, aged photocopiers and outdated switchboards. At the very least, many business travellers now expect a business centre furnished with the latest telecommunications, printing and PC equipment. And some are demanding at least some of these facilities in their rooms. In the 1990s, when productivity and efficiency are corporate bywords, an increasing number of travelling businessmen and women are sending a clear message to hoteliers that they will no longer tolerate bed-side telephones, cramped desks, inadequate lighting and inaccessible power sockets. Today, they expect to be able to turn their hotel rooms into offices capable of communicating directly with the outside world. The Hyatt Hotels group is one of the chains which has acknowledged and responded to this demand. Earlier this year, Hyatt announced that all 85 of its US and Canadian business hotels would provide its 'Business Plan' facilities by the end of March. Hyatt's business plan facilities include facsimile machines in every guest room, and business equipment including desktop computers, laser printers, photocopiers and office supplies accessible 24-hours-a-day, on every Business Plan floor. In addition, Business Plan guest rooms feature large desks, a desk telephone with computer hook-up and enhanced lighting. The desk lamp even has a power outlet on its base so that guests do not have to dive under the desktop to find a socket to plug in their portable PC power adapters. Hyatt charges its Business Plan guests an extra Dollars 15 a day on top of room rate for the additional facilities - which also include complimentary local 800-number and credit card telephone access. If the programme proves successful, it will be extended to Hyatt hotels overseas. The Chicago-based hotel group developed the business plan after a telephone survey of 500 business customers revealed that 72 per cent feel more 'pressure to produce' on business trips than they did five years ago. 58 per cent said they spent 'more time working in their hotel rooms than they did five years ago.' Other international hotel groups have also begun to respond to these pressures. In the UK, all six Inter-Continental and Forum hotels have recently added an extensive range of new products and facilities aimed at the international business traveller. These include state-of-the-art business centres, voice mail systems and other advanced telecommunications facilities such as mobile telephone hire. For example, last year the George Inter-Continental in Edinburgh installed what it claims is the most advanced telephone system in operation in any Edinburgh hotel. Facilities include two telephone lines in each guest room, enabling in-room facsimile services, the allocation of individual private telephone numbers for incoming calls to guests, automatic checkout from guest rooms, and a sophisticated television messaging system. However, the most extensive refurbishment, totalling Pounds 9.5m, is taking place at the Churchill Inter-Continental in London. It includes installation of a new Club Inter-Continental 'executive floor' modelled on a concept introduced by Inter-Continental in the Pacific/Asia region two years ago. Guests staying on the Club floor (which was officially opened at the Churchill earlier this month) have their own swift check-in/check-out facilities on the floor. Multi lingual staff are available to assist with business and travel arrangements. Each Club floor guest room features a dedicated fax/modem line in addition to an international direct dial telephone line - fax machines are available on request and are supplied in all suites. Transatlantic travellers in particular will appreciate the dual 110/220 voltage power sockets in each room. By providing such specialised business facilities, hotels hope that they will retain a competitive edge over their rivals and continue to attract the all-important business traveller. Features such as extra telephone lines and in-room facsimile machines certainly provide the business traveller with added convenience. Others make hotel bedrooms more 'office-friendly'. Nevertheless, technology is already helping the seasoned traveller overcome many of the limitations of less well-endowed establishments. For example, portable high-speed fax-modems - including some which plug into the credit-card sized PCMCIA slots on the newer notebook computers - now enable portable PC users to send and receive facsimile message directly from their screens via a standard telephone line. If secure voice-only telecommunications are required, then the business traveller will soon be able to use one of the new pan-European GSM-standard digital cellular telephones to make a telephone call almost anywhere in Europe. Where hard-copy paper print-outs are required, lightweight high quality portable printers are now available, as are notebook PCs with in-built ink-jet printers - such as, for example, those from Canon - and portable facsimile machines. But despite miniaturisation, squeezing all this gear into a shoulder-bag - let alone operating it - can require considerable skill and cunning, and lifting the bag may still require weight-training.</p>

			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE COLOR OF WAR  </P> <P> Re director Oliver Stone's glorifying of white males in the Vietnam War ("New  Film Brings the Old War Home," Jan. 22): Many thousands of Vietnam casualties  were African Americans -- heroic, dedicated and patriotic soldiers. Stone has  portrayed African American military men as lazy, inferior and cowardly. The  world knows better.  </P> <P> Please! Please! Spare us from another "White Platoon"!  </P> <P> JOHN JOHNSON  </P> <P> Venice Beach  </P></p>

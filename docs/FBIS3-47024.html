			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 7 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam  fascist clique recently threatened that the "labour-management  disputes" will be "dealt with toughly by law" and "emergency  arbitration power" will be invoked against workers' strikes even  though they are legal.    Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says the labour  movement in South Korea can by no means be a target of fascist  suppression.    Noting that the workers' strikes to push their demands  including wage hike are the exercise of their elementary rights  for existence, the analyst continues:    When he was active in an opposition party, Kim Yong-sam  stood  by the side of the workers, joining them in strikes at their  request. After climbing to power, however, he executed a swift  volte-face and began brandishing the sword at the workers. How  can such a person be called a human being?    Not much penetration is needed to see why the Kim Yong-sam  fascist clique is threatening the workers with "tough  counteraction" and "emergency arbitration power" from the  beginning of the year.    It is foreseen that the workers' struggle against the puppet  regime's flunkeyist and treacherous economic policy and  anti-popular labour policy will grow fiercer in South Korea this  year. Upset by this, the fascist clique schemes to check their  struggle by threatening them at the point of the bayonet from  the beginning of the year.    Bayonet-brandishing, however, is not almighty.    A MINJU CHOSON analyst says the more desperate the Kim  Yong-sam fascist clique get in suppressing the people with  bayonets, the faster it will precipitate the doom of the  "civilian" regime.</p>

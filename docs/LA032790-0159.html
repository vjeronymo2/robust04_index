			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AMEX SWEETENS OFFER FOR SHEARSON BUYOUT  </P> <P> American Express Co. today sweetened its purchase of outstanding shares of  Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and said it will give its struggling securities  unit $750 million in capital as previously announced.  </P> <P> The moves came amid reports that Shearson, the second-largest Wall Street firm,  is planning a first-quarter charge against earnings of more than $700 million,  which would be the largest ever in the securities industry.  </P> <P> American Express said each publicly held Shearson share will be converted into  0.48 of a share of American Express stock. That will be a 12.7% increase from  the 0.426 a share announced earlier this month.  </P> <P> The deal marks a reversal for American Express, which had planned to reduce its  majority stake in the Wall Street firm that is struggling because of  overexpansion and a recession in the securities industry. When completed,  American Express will own about 92% of Shearson.  </P> <P> The plan was approved late Monday by Shearson's board on the recommendation of  a special committee of Shearson directors and the American Express board.  </P> <P> Shearson stock jumped $1.12 1/2 to $12.37 1/2 in early New York Stock Exchange  trading today. American Express fell 50 cents to $26.37 1/2.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal reported that Shearson is expected to take a  charge against earnings of $700 million to $800 million in the first quarter.  </P> <P> The charge would cover severance payments for about 2,000 laid-off workers, the  cost of closing about 50 branch offices, reserves against losses at Shearson's  Balcor Co. real estate unit and lease payments for businesses Shearson plans to  leave.  </P> <P> Shearson and American Express said in a joint statement that attorneys for  shareholders had agreed to drop class-action suits challenging the merger,  pending court approval.  </P> <P> The suits claimed that American Express was offering too little for the  Shearson stock, which it had sold at $34 a share in an initial public offering  in 1987.  </P></p>

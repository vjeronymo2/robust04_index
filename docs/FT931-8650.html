			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Arts: The Invisible Man - Vaudeville, The Strand 'The Invisible Man', much praised by my colleague Andrew St George when it opened at the Theatre Royal, Stratford East, last October has transferred to the Vaudeville in the Strand where it should give pleasure for many months. Based on the HG Wells novel, the piece is written and directed by Ken Hill who did the non-musical version of 'The Phantom of the Opera'. Here the wonderful illusions - things that go bump in the light - are provided by Paul Kieve. The unmistakeable Theatre Royal style is at its irrepressible best. The photograph shows Michael N. Harbour in a moment of visibility. You can't miss him. MR</p>

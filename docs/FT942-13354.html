			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Coca-Cola opens Moscow plant:  European News Digest The Coca-Cola Company, the US soft drinks manufacturer, yesterday opened a Dollars 35m (Pounds 23.5m) plant in Moscow, its first fully-owned, greenfield operation in the former Soviet Union. Coca-Cola, which says sales last year grew 270 per cent, plans to open a Dollars 30m plant in St Petersburg next month. The Moscow plant will employ 300 people in what the company describes as Russia's first fully integrated system for producing and distributing consumer goods. Despite the confidence expressed by Coca-Cola executives in the Russian market, both investments enjoy coverage from Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the US government agency which helps US businesses invest abroad.</p>

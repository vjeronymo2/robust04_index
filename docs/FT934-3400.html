			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Prudential chief takes firm line on payouts Leading pension providers do not intend to provide compensation to people sold their products wrongly by independent financial advisers if Mr Mick Newmarch, Prudential chief executive, is any guide. Mr Newmarch emphasises his commitment to recompensing the 'handful' of people who have suffered after poor advice from the company's direct sales force to transfer out of occupational schemes and buy Prudential pensions. However, he is clear that his company is not responsible for independent advisers' actions. The Prudential is the UK's largest life insurer and one of the largest pension providers, with 850,000 pension holders and Pounds 65bn of assets under management. It has sold most of its pension products through its own direct sales force of about 8,000, with little business through independents. 'An (independent financial adviser) is sorting products from a whole variety of providers on the basis of his view of the best advice for his customer,' he said. 'If my contract is the best in his eyes and he chooses to use it, that's presumably good. If he misuses it, I can't be held responsible for that, can I?' The Prudential's exposure to this area of business is limited. It has some 45,000 personal pension holders transferred from occupational schemes since 1988, out of a market of between 400,000 and 500,000. Yet scale does depend on perspective. Mr Paul Trickett, the head of pensions in the Mineworkers' Pension Scheme, said some Pounds 58m had been transferred to the Prudential from that scheme since 1988. Mr Newmarch is unapologetic about the legitimate argument for personal pensions as well as proud of the Prudential's own record in training, procedures and setting standards for its sales force. The Prudential says the number of cases investigated for wrong advice so far has been about 100 at most. Even so, he recognises that the damage to people's perception of the industry could still affect his company. 'If the whole industry is being held as not properly organised and taking advantage of people's ignorance and innocence and so on, then at some point nobody escapes that general proposition,' he said. But he underlined that responsibility did not rest with the industry alone. Those such as the trustees of occupational schemes and schemes' consulting actuaries also had duties to provide proper information to aid decisions to transfer out of an occupational scheme. 'The responsibility in all this is a very complex series of interrelated events,' he said. On the basis that most of the life industry tried to behave properly, 'then where things go awry it is for a whole variety of complex reasons'. 'At the margin - I hope it's the margin - some companies have been uncontrolled in taking advantage of what they saw as a market opportunity, and the regulator's job is to stop that.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We used constructed value (CV) as FMV for those U.S. sales for which there were insufficient sales of the comparison home-market model at or above the COP. We calculated CV in accordance with section 773(e) of the Act. We made an adjustment to general and administrative expenses based on our finding that Akzo had allocated general and administrative costs to different product groups based on specific allocation methodologies. The costs reported were general in nature and related to all operations, and we allocated them to all of Akzo's product lines. In addition, we summed the cost of materials, indirect selling expenses, direct selling expenses, revised general and administrative expenses, net interest expenses, and imputed credit. In our calculation of the selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&amp;A), where the sum of the actual selling expenses and the revised general and administrative expenses was less than the statutory minimum of 10 percent of the cost of manufacturing (COM), we calculated SG&amp;A as 10 percent of the COM. Where the actual profits were less than the statutory minimum of 8 percent of COM plus SG&amp;A, we calculated profit as 8 percent of the sum of COM plus SG&amp;A. We adjusted CV for selling, credit, and packing expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For those models that had sufficient above-cost sales, the Department calculated FMV using home market prices based on the FOB price to unrelated purchasers. Where applicable, we made adjustments for inland freight (post-sale), inland insurance, packing, discounts, other discounts, interest revenue, rebates, and third party payments. We made adjustments for differences in technical services expenses and credit. We also made adjustments for differences in the physical characteristics of merchandise. The Department also made an adjustment to the amount of consumption taxes included in FMV in accordance with the Department's aforementioned tax adjustment methodology. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Preliminary Results <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a result of our review, we preliminarily determine the dumping margin to be: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 3,L2,tp0,i1,s10,16,6 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Manufacturer/Exporter <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Time period <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Margin (percent) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Akzo Faser A.G. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 2/20/92&hyph;5/31/93 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1.11 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Parties to this proceeding may request disclosure within 5 days of publication of this notice and any interested party may request a hearing within 10 days of publication.

Supp. 782 (1993), decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company, it can only be changed through an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is appropriate to reinstate the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for correction for clerical errors or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders for the purposes of establishing cash deposits in all current and future administrative reviews. Thus, the ``all others'' rate for the purposes of this review will be 24.58 percent, the ``all others'' rate established in the final notice of LTFV investigation by the Department (57 FR 21770). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice also serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: June 15, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Susan G.

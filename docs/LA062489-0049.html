			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TURMOIL IN CHINA: CRACKDOWN ON DISSENT;  </P> <P> BUSH ASKS LAWMAKERS FOR 'PATIENCE' ON CHINA  </P> <P> President Bush appealed Friday to members of Congress for "patience and  forbearance" with his cautious approach in dealing with China's crackdown on  dissent, according to legislators who met with him.  </P> <P> Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Delaware Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee, said the President made the appeal at a White House meeting with  leading lawmakers that focused primarily on the Middle East.  </P> <P> "With regard to China, the president asked for our patience and forbearance,"  Biden said. "He believed that it was appalling what was happening in China in  terms of human rights," but added "there was a long road that was going to have  to be traveled in that relationship and we shouldn't move precipitously," Biden  quoted Bush as saying.  </P> <P> To protest the wave of arrests and executions that has taken place since June  3-4, when Chinese troops mounted a bloody assault on pro-democracy  demonstrators in Beijing, Bush has suspended military sales to China, begun  efforts to stop $1.4 billion in international development loans and banned  high-level U.S. contacts with Beijing.  </P> <P> Senate Democratic leader George Mitchell of Maine, who was at the meeting, and  other lawmakers have criticized Bush for not taking stronger action to protest  the crackdown.  </P> <P> "Let's face it -- I think the president was saying that it is very simple to  take a precipitous action, break relations with China, but the long-range  interests of the United States require delicate, appropriate, judgmental  handling of the situation," said Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), who also  attended the session.  </P> <P> There were these other protests Friday against the executions and political  crackdown in Beijing:  </P> <P>  -- Belgium announced it has frozen state loans to China and stopped funding  for new development projects.  </P> <P> It has also suspended high-level visits between the two countries, a Foreign  Ministry spokesman said.  </P> <P> The freeze affects an agreed-upon $7.5-million loan and any new loans until  further notice.  </P> <P>  -- The Italian government said it had suspended future development aid to  China because of Beijing's "unacceptable repression." Foreign Minister Giulio  Andreotti said, "We have no choice but to suspend consideration (of future  programs) as a sign of our grave dissent from current executions and  unacceptable repression." Since 1987, Rome has said it would provide China with  aid and loans totaling $800 million.  </P> <P>  -- Japan Socialist Party Secretary General Tsuruo Yamaguchi, said Japan's  major opposition party had decided to suspend top-level exchanges with the  Chinese Communist Party for the time being. Yamaguchi said his party also  demanded that the Japanese government take strong action against China. He said  his planned visit to China later this year will be reconsidered.  </P> <P>  -- In Bonn, the West German parliament called on the United Nations to debate  violations of human rights in China without delay. A resolution backed by all  five parties represented in parliament condemned the executions and demanded  that the Security Council, the General Assembly and the human rights commission  of the United Nations "immediately deal with the aggravated human rights  violations in China."  </P> <P> It also called on China to declare an amnesty for dissidents, stop all  political trials and allow independent human rights groups to visit jailed  pro-democracy demonstrators. And it urged the World Bank to cancel further  credits to the Beijing government.  </P> <P> A Foreign Ministry official noted that the West German government had suspended  all development aid and economic cooperation with China but ruled out a  full-blown West German economic boycott.  </P></p>

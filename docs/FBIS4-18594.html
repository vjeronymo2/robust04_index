			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jan Friese: "The Possibilities on the </F> Subcontinent Have Not Yet Been Exploited"]    [Text] New Delhi, 5 Apr -- At a time when German-Indian  economic relations are currently far below their potential --  and there is general agreement about that -- this is certainly  not due to a lack of visitors. After Chancellor Helmut Kohl's  trip to India last year and the return visit by Prime Minister  Rao in February, FRG Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt's trip  to Delhi is the third visit to India by a German minister this  year.    Guenter Rexrodt has come to participate in the 11th meeting  of the "Joint Economic Committee" in the Indian capital. This  committee has been meeting at the ministerial level since 1988;  thus it is a routine matter. However, Rexrodt is going at an  important time in India's economic development and in  German-Indian economic relations.    Three bilateral treaties, an amendment to the German-Indian  double taxation agreement, a new aviation agreement, and an  investment protection agreement are in different stages of  preparation. The double-taxation agreement is practically  concluded, and the German side is reportedly satisfied with the  result.  <H5>  Agreements on Investment Protection </H5>   The FRG economics minister wants to finish the preparations  for signing the aviation agreement in Delhi. It will bring  about additional landing rights for Lufthansa in Indian cities  and, in addition, help Air India in expanding its tourist  business. The "investment protection and promotion agreement,"  is also virtually ready for signature apart from a few  "technical-juridical details." After Great Britain, the FRG will  be the second country with which India will conclude such an  agreement.    The 20-person economic delegation accompanying the minister  stresses that the visit will naturally also deal with  down-to-earth business. Rexrodt told correspondents that he  wants to advocate several specific projects, among others in the  fields of telecommunications, machine-building, iron and steel,  energy, and food industry.    In New Delhi, Rexrodt will also meet with Indian Prime  Minister Rao, Finance Minister Singh, and Minister of Commerce  Mukherjee, as well as the minister of civilian aviation and  tourism, the minister of post and telecommunications, and the  state secretary in the Foreign Ministry.    In the meetings with Rao, Singh, and Mukherjee, it is likely  that not just "bilateral issues" will be discussed, because the  Indians' worries concerning the GATT conference in Marrakesh are  currently the dominating economic policy issue in New Delhi.    Rexrodt's doubts whether environment-specific trade barriers  are the best way to make free world trade compatible with the  environment are not only shared by New Delhi, but are seen as a  neoprotectionist specter, together with other initiatives, such  as "trade-related work norms" and countervailing duties against  "social dumping." In contrast to the skirmish with Washington,  New Delhi hopes that it will find a few common points with Bonn  in these fields.    In the bilateral sphere, it is intended to look for new ways  to strengthen German-Indian partnership in trade and industrial  cooperation. If German industry "is underrepresented in the  Asian-Pacific region," as the Federal Government's Asian concept  says, this quite certainly also applies to India because German  industry has only a very moderate share in the current boom in  India, especially regarding investments.  <H5>  Bilateral Trade Stimulated Again </H5>   Even though German investments in India have doubled every  year since 1990 (measured by the approved applications), the  German share in total foreign investments in India has, at the  same time, declined from second place to 10th place. Only  regarding the number of cooperation projects (173 in 1993) have  German companies successfully maintained their traditional  second place among India's partners in technology.    It seems that German investment capital is still shy.  Several large projects of renowned companies, such as Siemens,  BASF, and Mercedes-Benz, to cite just a few, permit, however,  the conclusion that a change is emerging in this field.    German-Indian trade has also been stimulated again after an  extended period of stagnation. Trade volume rose by 12 percent  in 1993; thus, for the first time exceeding 6 billion German  marks. This is a sum that Rexrodt called "very, very small" with  a view to China. "We are not here without euphoria," Rexrodt  said, referring to the missed opportunities, "and we are not  just thinking of China anymore."    Customs reductions, great plans for expansion in the field  of  infrastructure, reorganization of the nationalized companies,  and a quickly growing large market give the go-ahead for major  business with India. The glitches in implementing these plans  will be the main subject of the ministers' meeting in New Delhi.</p>

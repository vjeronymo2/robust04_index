			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of Hong Kong (14): Big shift in population planned - More skyscrapers to be built in the New Territories LAST YEAR it was fishponds, gently worked by rural families still farming this area of Hong Kong's New Territories. Today, the calm has been shattered by convoys of trucks bringing yellow rock, freshly hewn from nearby hills for foundations for skyscrapers. Soon the first few families will move in and, by 1997, this will be home for 150,000 Hong Kong people. The dramatic transformation of Tin Shui Wai in the New Territories' far north-west into Hong Kong's latest new town, complete with shopping arcades, bowling alleys and Japanese restaurants, marks the latest step in a remarkable population shift. Faced with a population explosion from immigration and a baby boom in the 1960s, government planners earmarked the New Territories as the only place left to house the overflow from the cramped areas of Hong Kong Island and Kowloon. Eight new towns have been built so far. The sleepy Cantonese clan villages of the 1960s have been overrun by 30-storey apartment blocks, ring roads and industrial estates. The population has quadrupled since 1961. By 1997 it will have almost doubled again to 3.27m, more than half Hong Kong's total. In the villages around the new town of Yuen Long the effects of such rapid urbanisation are still being felt. Mr Tso, now in his 70s, fled here from China with his wife and cousins. Their tiny cottage, with one living room and sleeping area above, stands opposite the village temple. Until last year it was inaccessible to cars. Now a major road is being built through the village, flattening the Tsos' cottage and forcing them out into a modern government housing estate. Mr Tso does not want to leave and enter the 'modern' world. For a start, he has never been in a lift. The New Territories have rarely captured the imagination of the expatriates and businessmen who pass through Hong Kong. It cannot offer the icons of the future, the skyscrapers and neon on Hong Kong's harbour, nor the icons of the past available just a few miles north in China. But in places the tangled hills, turned an even deeper shade of green by passing clouds, the long hiking trails popular with Hong Kong Chinese enjoying the clean, or cleanish, air and the lolling atmosphere of life all combine to laugh in the face of the madness that is the better-known Hong Kong. The area is roughly 15 miles deep by 25 wide. It was leased by Britain in 1898 when the European powers scrambled for concessions in China. Britain wanted the land as a buffer zone to protect Hong Kong and its valuable harbour, acquired 57 years earlier. It is the lease on the New Territories, expiring in 1997, which forced Britain to agree to return Hong Kong to China. Colonial administrators largely ignored the farmers, pearl fishermen and local traders of the New Territories, prefering to maintain order through alliance with the Heung Yee Kuk, a powerful group of land owners. Even in the 1960s, when the Kuk were armed against communist uprisings, Britain assessed the political climate in the New Territories unscientifically, by counting Chinese and Taiwanese flags flying in the villages. As the area has become an overflow for Hong Kong people, so valleys and farm land have become dumping grounds for the less edifying aspects of Hong Kong life. Remote areas like High Island in Sai Kung are home to Vietnamese Boat People, tucked out of sight of Hong Kong taxpayers, who pay for the accommodation, as well as hiking tourists. In return for its support, the Heung Yee Kuk was absolved from colonial interference. Rules governing land use were never introduced. In the 1980s local farmers found it hard to compete against cheap vegetable imports from China. So instead of farming, they have hired out their land as storage areas for shipping containers, construction materials and scrap heaps. The farmers now watch television or gamble all day on the stock market with their profits. Beside the tiny roads around Lau Fau Shan, once reknowned for its natural beauty, fields full of rusting containers piled six or seven high provide a powerful but unpleasant reminder of Hong Kong's trading status. The government, claiming to be sensitive to environmental lobbying, has clamped down on this new kind of absentee landlordism. Even though the measures are half hearted, they have provoked the wrath of the Kuk, which believes it has been betrayed. Mr Lau Wong-fat, chairman, says his members are being deprived of their right to use their land as they wish. The Kuk's custom of only recognising male succession is also under attack because Hong Kong is introducing a Bill of Rights which guarantees equality before the law. Mr Lau says these rights and customs were guaranteed in the 1898 Peking Convention and in more recent treaties like the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini constitution after 1997. He says the traditionally pro-British Kuk, a force for stability in the New Territories, will become more confrontational is its grievances are not addressed. Near the small town of Kam Tin, two walled villages owned by the Tang clan still draw tourists and curious locals. The present clan matriachs, quick to spot an earner, greet visitors with a demand for money - 'one photo, two dollar - one photo, two dollar]' It would be no surprise if their traditional silk gowns are donned only for the photo call or, perhaps, are designed to conceal portable phones. Away from the ever widening main roads there are still reminders of the past. Near the Chinese border in the east, around Ta Kwu Ling, farming hamlets are linked by thin concrete paths which wind through patchwork fields of vegetables and rice paddy. One field is lined with pot plants, soon to be packed off south to the boardrooms of Hong Kong's businessmen. Clumps of bamboo offer shade for the village's dogs. The same bamboo will one day support Hong Kong's construction workers atop the colony's building sites. On one recent Sunday afternoon, the only sounds come from an old Hakka woman carting firewood back home and families watching the horse racing at Sha Tin on television. Occasionally there is the clatter of a game of mahjong, a Cantonese favourite which combines the opportunity to make lots of noise with, hopefully, lots of money. Near Fanling, another new town in the north east, the bus passes army camps which act as home to the Gurkhas, defenders of Hong Kong until 1997. China's People's Liberation Army came to visit recently and assess their future barracks. They returned to China amazed at the number of tennis courts. On the other side of the town is Wo Hop Shek cemetery, Hong Kong's largest, which snakes away into the hills. Each year families return to share some food and clean the graves of their ancestors. But as more and more Hong Kong people head overseas for a foreign passport, ancestors are being neglected. The tombs lie silent, cluttered with the debris of past seasons. As the light quickly fades, photographs of the deceased on the headstones gaze northwards across the hills towards China, awaiting the return of their former masters.</p>

Proponents of the plan to restructure the Police Commission  said the rejection underlined the need to curb the power of  active and retired police officers on the panel and bring the  police force under the interior minister's control.    "I have done my best. I tried to make members of the Police  Commission understand. The Police Department has suffered  enough. Everybody should be working together instead of causing  more confusion," Gen Chawalit said after the commission meeting.    Chawalit said the commission had ignored his plea for an  open  discussion and vote to decide the nomination for the top police  job. The commission instead chose to vote by secret ballot.    The interior minister acknowledged that the commission was  legally empowered to reject the nomination, but said he believed  the decision went against public opinion, which wanted a new  police chief appointed as soon as possible. He would decide  before the month is out whether to resubmit Prathin's name or to  make a new nomination to the commission.    Chawalit said he had told Prathin, currently acting police  chief, to perform his duty to the best of his ability.    The interior minister said he would definitely push for the  restructuring of the Police Commission when the time was right.  Current members would be consulted.    Prime Minister Chuan Likphai, speaking to reporters at  Government House yesterday evening, described the commission  decision as "unusual", but said he believed it would not in any  way affect Prathin's authority as acting police chief.    "The interior minister will do whatever he sees fit. He may  want to resubmit the nomination when he chooses to," Chuan said.  The prime minister also stressed the need to restructure the  Police Commission to achieve a balance of power between the  interior minister and the police governing body, but only after  current problems at the Police Department had been resolved.    Prathin told reporters after meeting Chawalit yesterday  afternoon that he had anticipated the commission would reject  his appointment.    "The Police Commission decided not to approve my nomination.  That's okay with me. I'm not disheartened. I had expected  this," the acting police chief said. "I will carry on with my  duty as long as I receive assignments from Gen Chawalit."    He said the commission had not bothered to give any reasons  why he should not be appointed director general.    Later in the evening, after meeting the prime minister at  Government House, Prathin said he may have to serve as acting  police chief until his retirement in September this year.    "I have the feeling that I may have to continue to serve as  acting police chief," he said. "As an acting police chief I  have the full authority of a police director general." [passage  omitted]</p>

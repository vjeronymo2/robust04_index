The agenda of the session of the upper chamber of Russia's  parliament tackles some organizational issues which were left  undecided at the first session, including the elections of a  third deputy chairman of the Council of Federation and  chairpersons of four committees (the leaders of six other  committees have already been elected), adoption of the  regulations of the Federation Council and several other  documents.    The upper chamber is also to consider several presidential  decrees which cannot come into force without its approval.    These include President Yeltsin's decree on prolongation of  a  state of emergency in the southern Republics of Ingushetia and  Northern Ossetia which is likely to top the list.    The Federation Council will also consider the social and  economic situation in the Russian Federation, Vladimir Shumeyko,  chairman of the Federation Council, told a recent press  conference.    Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin is expected to  report on the issue at an early date. Afterwards the prime  minister and the deputies who include many heads of local  administrations and presidents of Russia's republics, will  discuss the 1994 budget of the Russian Federation, Shumeyko said.    The discussion will precede an extended session of the  government on the issue and therefore should enable, in  Shumeyko's opinion, the State Duma to adopt a draft budget to be  worked out by the cabinet as soon as possible.    According to Shumeyko, he has coordinated the lawmaking  activities of the two chambers with Ivan Rybkin, speaker of the  State Duma. (The Russian Constitution has it that the Federation  Council has to decide on the bills adopted by the State Duma  within 14 days).    There is no indication so far that the State Duma will take  a  non-constructive stand, Shumeyko noted.    The sessions of the Federation Council will last, as a rule,  for a week and then a two-week break will follow, he specified.    Only 34 persons will work for the Federation Council on a  full-time basis, including the chairman and his deputies,  chairpersons of the committees and their deputies.</p>

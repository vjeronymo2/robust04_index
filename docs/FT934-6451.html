			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Retaliatory measures expected The US Congress is expected to press ahead next year with legislation authorising retaliatory trade measures in the financial services sector, even if the immediate need for the bill as a negotiating weapon in the Gatt talks has gone by then. The Treasury had hoped the progress of the 'Fair Trade in Financial Services' bill through Congress would increase their leverage to persuade countries such as Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines and Brazil to improve their offers to increase access to their financial markets as the Uruguay Round of Gatt negotiations draws to a close. The bill would allow the Treasury to restrict the expansion of banks and securities companies from countries which do not offer equal access to American businesses. Treasury officials say they made some headway in recent visits to some of these countries, but are wary of predicting the outcome of the talks on financial services, which remains, from the US perspective, one of the biggest stumbling blocks to an overall Gatt agreement. Although the Senate banking committee's attempt to agree on the bill's language was held up by an unrelated dispute on legislation to allow US banks to open branches outside their home states, in the House of Representatives the subcommittee on international development, finance and trade completed work on a draft. The House has in the past been the most difficult obstacle to passage of similar retaliatory legislation, largely because of differences of opinion between the banking, energy and commerce and ways and means committees. Congressional aides expect, however, that this time these divergences will be smoothed out, enabling the bill to pass early next year. These aides say that whether or not the Gatt talks are completed by the US deadline of December 15, the legislation will be needed. In the event of a successful Gatt deal, it would be required to enforce the two-tier approach US negotiators want to apply in the financial services area, discriminating against 'free riders' which have not opened their markets. Other aides caution, however, that the language of the bill, which has been carefully wrought to exclude the European Union from any retaliation threat, is so closely tied to the Gatt talks that it would need to be completely reworked in the event of a breakdown, or if the US fails to win the exemption it is seeking in the financial services sector from the obligation to apply the most favoured nation principle.</p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HATE CRIMES DIRECTED AT HOMOSEXUALS  </P> <P> In last Sunday's (May 28) Times, the prescient Commentary ("Why Hate Crimes  Against Gays Should Be Everybody's Nightmare") provides a gratifying  juxtaposition to a letter (on the opposite page) wherein one reads such --  among other -- inanities as "the opposite sex is terrifying as it is" and "only  by keeping sexual perversities in the closet," etc.  </P> <P> George Kennan, in his recent literary masterpiece, gives us an observation so  pertinent as a perspective on such as the subject quotes -- "For one of the  keys to the understanding of the human predicament is the recognition that  there is, for the human individual, no reality -- no comprehensible and useful  reality, at any rate -- other than that of an object as perceived by the human  eye and the human mind. All that we see around us may be considered to some  extent as a part of ourselves, the reflection of our own astigmatisms."  </P> <P> The "perceptions" of the referenced letter writer must emanate from a seemingly  deranged mind: pitiful.  </P> <P> DON PERLEY  </P> <P> Yorba Linda  </P></p>

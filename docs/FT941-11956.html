			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Fading hopes of a reduction in German interest rates this week, together with active selling from leading securities houses, brought a retreat by stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. Dealers reported an erratic start to the session after the first trade in the March contract on the FT-SE 100 was struck at 3,512. The early activity included what initially appeared to be a big buy order, sending the contract advancing to 3,524. The realisation that it was an order to sell saw March reverse earlier gains. A feeling that tomorrow's Bundesbank meeting was unlikely toannounce a reduction in German rates, weakness in the gilts sector and selling from some of the big brokers, only served to increase the slide. After a further retreat in the afternoon brought about by a dull opening on Wall Street,dealers were suddenly caught short, which led to a squeeze just ahead of the official close. March, which traded at a discount to cash for much of the session, ended at 3,481, seven points below its previous close and just ahead of its fair value premium of about one point. Volume at the official close stood at15,380 contracts. In traded options, turnover in the FT-SE 100 option improved to 15,034, making a significant contribution to the day's total of 43,657 lots. However, the Euro-FT-SE 100 option performance was below its recent average and traded a mere 1,533 contracts. SmithKline Beecham was the most actively dealt stock option, closing with 4,156 contracts, followed by Hanson at 3,334 trades.</p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Warsaw and Bonn agree goodwill treaty A MILESTONE German-Poland treaty, in which Poland recognises its German minority for the first time since 1945, will be signed next month by the countries' leaders. The German government said yesterday the friendship and co-operation treaty would fundamentally alter previously strained relations between the two nations. Bonn would now proceed step-by-step towards the same relationship with Poland as it has with France. The 38-article treaty, together with a border accord signed last November, is to be submitted to both parliaments for approval. Warsaw previously denied the existence of ethnic Germans in Poland; estimates put their number at up to 200,000. In a draft treaty approved by the foreign ministers of the two countries last weekend, Poland agreed to grant full equality to its Germans. In return Germany will fully support Polish associated status in the European Community as a first step towards full membership. Both countries say they will work closely to achieve 'co-operative structures' for Europe, together with members of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). Germany is Poland's main western trading partner and Warsaw hopes for substantial German investment. Ethnic Germans in Poland will be given full educational, cultural and religious equality with Poles. They, and not officials, will decide whether they belong to the German minority and will be allowed to use their German family names. Ethnic Poles in Germany - many of whom arrived in the last century and were assimilated - are to enjoy the same rights. The Federation of Expellees in Germany strongly criticised Mr Hans Dietrich Genscher, the foreign minister, this week for ignoring its demands focusing on the rights of ethnic Germans expelled from Poland after the Second World War. Warsaw has voiced concern over plans by ethnic Germans in Upper Silesia to meet German expellees next month at Annaberg, site of a fierce battle in 1921 between German soldiers and Polish nationalists.</p>

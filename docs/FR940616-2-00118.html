(See the accompanying guidelines for complete cost-sharing and auditing requirements.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Additional Criteria for Category A <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> President's University Student Exchange Program (the 1000&hyph;1000 Student Exchange) With the Baltic Countries and the New Independent States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Grant funding under this category is intended to enhance and expand the scope of U.S. academic exchanges with undergraduate and graduate students from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. For accident year 1995&hyph;96 the intention is to exchange 1,000 students in each direction. Priority will be given to applications from international exchange organizations and consortia of universities that have a demonstrated ability to exchange students from multiple countries in the former USSR. Preference will then be given to applications from single institutions for programs outside the Russian Federation. For projects in the Russian Federation, preference will be given to applications involving multiple foreign partner institutions, especially outside of Moscow and St. Petersburg. Both existing and new projects are eligible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Awards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Project awards to U.S. organizations will be made in a wide range of amounts. The Agency reserves the right to reduce, revise or increase proposal budgets in accordance with the needs of the program. For organizations with less than four years of experience in international exchange activities, grants will be limited to a maximum of $60,000, and proposed budgets should not exceed this amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Participants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Participants must be citizens either of the U.S. or of the host country. Undergraduate students are defined as students who have not received their baccalaureates prior to participation in this program. Graduate students for this program should be studying at the equivalent of the Master's degree level. Doctoral candidates are not eligible. Students in all academic fields are eligible; students of agricultural are especially encouraged to apply (please note special conditions for agricultural programs below). Projects that include graduate students must delineate between the number of graduate and undergraduate participants, separately describe the academic programs, and include for each a separate line item in the budget. All projects must include undergraduate students. It is important that the selection process ensure equal opportunities for both male and female students.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Language Qualifications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Students should have sufficient fluency in the institutional language of the host country to be able to pursue university study in that language and to be able to converse with the citizens of the country without the aid of interpreters. Generally, the equivalent of two years of college-level study is considered the minimum.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (4) Duration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applications will be accepted for projects with durations of at least eight weeks to no more than one year, including programs lasting an academic quarter, trimester, or semester. Exchanges of less than eight weeks duration or more than one year will be considered technically ineligible. Although grant awards may begin earlier, the actual exchange of participants may not begin before February 1, 1995, and must be completed by December 31, 1996. Programs for exchanges in subsequent academic years will be considered technically eligible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (5) Preference Factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a. Preference will be given to proposals in which incoming students study in the U.S. for a full academic year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Preference will be given to programs that reflect wide geographic distributions in recruitment of participants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Preference will be given to programs that recruit foreign and U.S. participants through merit-based, open competition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (6) Reciprocity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposals should be reciprocal, but not necessarily equal in numbers. In cases where political or practical circumstances do not allow for the placement of U.S. students, one-way programs will be considered. The proposal should provide detailed information on the activities in both the U.S. and the partner country.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (7) Internships <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While programs may include internships, the focus of projects should be classroom work or research. If internships are included in the exchange experience, students should have completed at least one semester of classroom work. The duration of the internship should not exceed the duration of the classroom work. Institutions are encouraged to grant academic credit for the internship experience.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (8) Special Allowances for Agriculture Programs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to give added encouragement to the participation of students of agriculture as provided for in the bilateral agreement, language standards may be modified for participating students of agriculture. Programs including agriculture students need not exchange agriculture students in both directions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Additional Criteria for Categories B and C  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Category B: Samantha Smith Memorial Exchange With the Baltic Countries and the New Independent States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Grant funding is intended to enhance and expand the scope of academic exchanges with Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan for undergraduate students under the age of 26. Participants must be citizens either of the U.S. or of the host country. Programs designed specifically for foreign participants to teach their native language or area studies in American institutions are ineligible for support.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

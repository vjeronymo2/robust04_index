			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Cliveden chief buys Principal Hotels chain from receiver Principal Hotels, which went into receivership two years ago with debts of Pounds 100m, has been taken over in a Pounds 65m deal led by Mr John Lewis, chairman of Cliveden, the former stately home that is now a luxury hotel. Principal, based in Leeds, has 22 hotels, mainly of three-star standard, with two in both Denmark and the Netherlands. The chain includes the Norbreck Castle in Blackpool, the Royal in York, and the Imperial in Harrogate. It has been run successfully by its management under Mr Edward Klempka, corporate recovery partner of Coopers &amp; Lybrand in Leeds, the receiver, making Pounds 6m profit in 1992 and Pounds 7.5m last year. Mr Lewis, who will be keeping his prestigious Cliveden operation entirely separate, won a tight contest against a consortium led by Legal &amp; General and Mr Michael Purtill, Principal's managing director. Mr Purtill will leave the group, but the rest of the management team will continue under Mr Lewis, and will get some equity participation. The price paid for Principal is not being disclosed, but is believed to be close to Pounds 60m, with the remainder of the Pounds 65m being raised for working capital. About Pounds 31m of the total finance is equity, provided by NatWest Ventures, the leader of the deal, Granville Development Capital, Prudential Ventures, Bankers Trust and Royal Bank Development Capital. The loan finance is being provided by Morgan Grenfell and the Bank of Scotland, but it is believed that Barclays Bank may also participate. Blenheim Capital Ventures, a new financial services group set up by former Bank of Tokyo and Hill Samuel staff, facilitated the deal and brought together the equity partners. Mr Lewis takes on all liabilities incurred by the receiver during the two-year administration, but the deal excludes any pre-receivership debt.</p>

			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REUNIFICATION OF GERMANY  </P> <P> I find it odd that in The Times' excellent coverage of the German reunification  celebrations (Oct. 3) there is no mention of Ronald Reagan's cry, "Mr.  Gorbachev, tear down this wall."  </P> <P> I believe that cry had something to do with triggering the landslide that  helped dislodge the Soviet hold on Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> And how ironic it is that Reagan was recently cheered in Berlin and Poland and  warmly greeted in Moscow, while in his own country little note is made. Except  in the cartoons of Conrad who ("A combination of factors brought these deficits  about!" Oct. 3), again claims that the cause of all America's ills is one  Ronald Reagan.  </P> <P> TONY THOMAS  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

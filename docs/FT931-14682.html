			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: Building a retirement nest egg - Single premium pensions for the self-employed RETIREMENT saving for the self-employed takes discipline. But it can be done much more effectively, and more cheaply, if the discipline comes from the saver and not the insurance company. That means using single premium pensions, rather than the more heavily sold and arguably more convenient regular premium contracts. At this time of year, people with an irregular income will normally start to put some of it into a personal pension. This is most administratively simple if the pension is a regular premium arrangement, where you have contracted in advance to make fixed payments at fixed intervals. The other big advantage of this method is 'pound-cost averaging'. By saving regularly in small amounts, the problem of timing is avoided, and, if the market is turbulent, then at least some of the premiums will be paid when values are at their cheapest. If you opt to buy a single premium pension each year, you will need to do so between January and March. But James Higgins of Chamberlain De Broe points out that the first few months of the year are not traditionally the best time to invest in equities. The standard stock market saw is to 'sell in May and go away'. So regular premiums might be better for the totally unsophisticated. However, there are limits to this investment argument. Firstly, single premiums allow the investor to choose a different manager each year, diversifying risk, and spreading expertise. Diversification is, if anything, even more desirable than pound-cost averaging. Taking the pension on retirement could get very difficult if too many companies are used. But using five or six fund managers, rather than one, for managing pension funds, can only increase the security of the final retirement income. Then there is the fact that, in the words of John Cole, of Berry, Birch &amp; Noble, 'a pension is no more than an investment which has tax advantages and also tax restrictions'. It should be treated, he says, as a part of a wide portfolio of investments. As pensions justifiably cost more to administer than other forms of saving, that would point to making regular savings through another vehicle, and topping up annually with single premium pensions where necessary. For example, regular savings into a unit or investment trust Pep provide much the same investments as a personal pension. Contributions are not 'grossed up' when they are paid in, but the final payout can be taken at any time and is more tax-efficient than a pension payout. Those who do not opt for a Pep saving scheme might still take out a regular premium pension plan for a relatively small amount. This limits the danger that you will be unable to keep up with a high regular premium, and then face stiff penalties. This is the approach recommended by David Harris of Chantrey Vellacott. He says: 'In general, I would attempt to encourage individuals to pay around 25 per cent of their total annual contributions by regular premiums and then undertake a fuller, additional, planning exercise to use up as much of their total retirement reliefs as possible each year.' Personal pensions come in almost as broad a range of sectors and investments as unit trusts, so this allows enthusiastic investors the chance to make some imaginative choices. It is the expense which makes single premiums better for most people. Typically, the commission on a Pounds 100 per month regular contract works out at Pounds 540, while for a Pounds 5,000 single premium it would be Pounds 260 - you would need to pay regular premiums a long time to counterbalance this. The 'allocation rate' plays an important part of this - this refers to the proportion of premiums paid which are actually put towards providing retirement benefits. According to Harris, with regular contributions, allocation rates for an initial period (usually one or two years) are between 50 and 70 per cent. After that, around 95 per cent will go towards benefits. This can increase to more than 100 per cent for young lives, or for large contributions (Harris suggests Pounds 500 per month or more). By contrast, single premium contributions under Pounds 5,000 usually have between 95 and 97 per cent allocation rates, according to Harris, and this can rise to 105 per cent for contributions of Pounds 15,000 or more. Other charges to watch out for on regular premium contracts are the standard bid-offer spread - almost always five per cent - plus annual management charges and flat plan charges. Cole identifies one typical client for whom single premiums are always preferable - the person who takes early retirement and then continues to work on a freelance or consultancy basis. Both the level of income each year from such an arrangement, and the timespan before the client wants to start drawing the pension are unknown, so a regular premium policy cannot be justified.</p>

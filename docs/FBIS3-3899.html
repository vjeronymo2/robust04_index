The sub-heading to the  remaining part of the article is "The Two Pillars of a  Theoretical Edifice." [end editor's note])    The theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics  represents a great theoretical achievement for our party in the  new historical period. This theory has integrated the universal  principles of Marxism with the concrete realities of China and  has taken shape on the basis of summarizing our previous  practical experience, especially the new experience gained in  building socialism since the commencement of reforms and the  open policy. This theory represents the crystallization of our  party's and people's wisdom.    The theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics  initiates a whole range of breakthroughs in traditional Marxism.  It represents new and important developments in  Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. It is Marxism of  contemporary China. Comrade Deng Xiaoping is the founder of  contemporary Marxism. His related works, especially the  recently published Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, reveal the most important and highly original  thinking during the process of forming and developing the theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.    Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping,  is rich in content and profound in ideology. Let me now talk  about some of the things I have learned from this important  breakthrough made by Comrade Deng Xiaoping in the concept of  socialism.  <H5>  A New Concept of Socialism </H5>   The most conspicuous aspect of this theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics in the creative  development of Marxism is that it expounds a new concept of  socialism, one which is different from that espoused by  traditional Marxism.    In order to explain that this is a new concept of socialism  one needs to recall history.    Traditional Marxism vigorously stresses class struggle and  the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is because during the  lifetimes of Marx, Engels and even Lenin class struggle was, in  reality, widespread and manifested itself quite sharply. The  doctrines of Marx and Engels, taken in their literal sense,  sought the emancipation of both the proletariat and the whole of  mankind and the eventual realization of communism. However,  because the times in which they lived reflected the harsh rule  exercised by the bourgeoisie, and because of the fact that the  bourgeoisie would neither relinquish its rule nor automatically  retreat from the stage of history, the proletariat therefore had  to use revolutionary means to overthrow bourgeois rule and,  moreover, by means of the dictatorship of the proletariat,  protect the newly established socialist system. Only then could  it liberate itself from capitalist oppression. Under such  circumstances scientific socialism could not but change its  emphasis from general inquiries into the question of the  emancipation of the proletariat and mankind to that of probing  questions related to the conditions required for emancipating  the proletariat. Engels, in his work Socialism: Utopian  and Scientific, defined scientific socialism as "the  doctrine of conditions required for the emancipation of the  proletariat." At that time the so-called conditions for the  emancipation of the proletariat referred to the elimination of  capitalist exploitation and oppression and thereby the  establishment of the socialist system through the proletarian  revolution and dictatorship of the proletariat. However, as  Marx and Engels saw it, this was merely the first step in the  emancipation of the proletariat and there were still questions  to be resolved in relation to its further emancipation. In the  Communist Manifesto and in many other works they  repeatedly observed that the proletariat had to achieve its own  complete emancipation only by emancipating the whole of mankind.  This so-called emancipation of the whole of mankind is none  other than the implementation of communism, which in turn is the  final goal in emancipating the proletariat. Thus the conditions  required for emancipation are far more complex than just  revolution or the dictatorship of the proletariat. Since the  whole of mankind must be emancipated, the productive forces in  society should be highly developed, material goods should be  abundant and peoples's spiritual horizons should be greatly  enhanced. Only in this way can mankind become the master of  nature, society and itself; only in this way can one traverse  the narrow-mindedness of the bourgeois right and genuinely  implement "from each according to his ability, to each according  to his need." This mission is different from that of a  revolution or a dictatorship which, through radical means,  brings about a sudden change in society. It is, from start to  finish, a gradual process of change from a quantitative to a  partially qualitative nature; it is a gradual cumulative  progression of a new nature. For a country which, in any case,  is economically and culturally backward it is necessary to  undergo even greater hardship. These ideas of Marx and Engels  are an important element of scientific socialism; however, they  have gradually faded from people's minds. Because Marx and  Engels were never able to see with their own eyes the  emancipation of the proletariat from the capitalist system and,  moreover, since no such emancipation took place for a period  even after their deaths, but indeed, on the contrary, the  bourgeoisie continued its exploitation and oppression of the  proletariat, the urgent and practical task of the Marxist  political parties in each country became the realization of the  first stage of emancipation of the proletariat. Thence, the  proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat  became the central theme of Marxism. In this way, an incomplete  understanding of Marxism affected Marxists for several decades.    Lenin led the emancipation of the Russian proletariat from  Czarist rule and thereby transformed a militaristic, feudal  imperialist state into a socialist country. Although the  Russian proletariat overthrew the rule of the exploiting  classes, the exploiting classes nevertheless could not reconcile  themselves to their defeat and they collaborated with external  imperialist forces to crazily attack the newly established  Soviet power. This created a situation whereby, although Russia  had already overthrown the exploitative ruling classes, it  nevertheless found itself still embroiled in class struggle.  Thereupon, the goal of achieving communism and the emancipation  of the whole of mankind became a distant ambition. This is why  Lenin still frequently pondered upon the questions of class  struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Later the  internal situation of the Soviet Union and the international  environment both improved, and the main emphasis in Lenin's  deliberations began to change. Questions of economics and the  development of productive forces clearly gained more importance  in Lenin's works. For example, he states: "After the  proletariat achieves political power in the state its most  fundamental interest is in increasing the quantity of products  and in vastly expanding social productive forces. This task has  already been clearly stated in the program of the Russian  Communist Party. In today's post-war situation, with a bankrupt  economy, starvation and destruction, this task is even more  important." (Selected Works of Lenin, Vol 4, p 586)  He also states: "If we cannot rebuild our country's economy,  then we shall lag behind and continue to lag behind the big  capitalist powers, and as a result we shall be vulnerable to  attack." (Selected Works of Lenin, Vol 4, p 384)  Lenin even makes the following assertion: "In the final  analysis labor productivity is the most important thing in  guaranteeing the success of the new social system."  (Selected Works of Lenin, Vol 4, p 16) In talking  about the party's work, Lenin states that the party must improve  all aspects of its work so that it can lead the Soviet economic  construction. In 1921, Lenin addressed the realities facing  Russia by decisively advocating the New Economic Policy which,  in essence, was a policy to improve Russia's economic  circumstances by developing a commodity economy and increasing  the level of production. Unfortunately, the untimely death of  Lenin brought about an immediate end to these very valuable  explorations.    Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong the CPC  consistently emphasized that the universal truths of Marxism and  Leninism must be integrated with the actual realities of China.  During his long revolutionary practice Comrade Mao Zedong  consistently upheld a creative Marxist attitude of rejecting  bookishness and dogmatism and choosing to use China's national  conditions as a starting point. He led the whole party to a  glorious victory along a democratic revolutionary path which had  its own Chinese characteristics. However, as China found itself  in a prolonged revolutionary war, the Chinese democratic  revolution was astonishingly complex, and this could not but be  reflected in the works of Mao Zedong at that time. During this  period Comrade Mao Zedong's most important theoretical  achievement was that of the theory on new democracy. In the  important work On New Democracy, Comrade Mao Zedong  theoretically expounds a whole host of questions, including the  relationship between the democratic and socialist revolutions,  the composition of the future state and the politics, economics,  culture, and so on of new democracy. However, when all is said  and done, it is nevertheless a theoretical summary of the  practical experience of a democratic revolution, and in no way  can it involve questions on how to undertake construction work  after the victory of the democratic revolution. After the  founding of New China, Comrade Mao Zedong led the whole party in  completing the remaining tasks of the democratic revolution,  rebuilding the economy, implementating socialist reforms and the  commencement of industrialization. This clearly shows the  importance our party gave to the development of productive  forces and the building of the economy for a particular period.  The Eighth CPC National Congress, which was convened in  September 1956, testifies to this fact, the congress clearly  highlighting the central task of the party as being the  development of productive forces. However, shortly afterward,  because of the drastic changes in the international situation,  our party made the "leftist" mistake of over-enlarging the scope  of class struggle. Consequently, the strategic plan drawn up by  the eighth party congress, with the development of productive  forces as its centerpiece, was never really put into effect and  came to a premature end. Thereafter, we became enmeshed in the  "struggle philosophy" and constant, never- ending class  struggle. That is to say, having completed the task of  socialist transformation and having established a socialist  system, just when we ought to have changed the emphasis of the  whole party's work to that of building the economy, we never  really undertook the change; alternatively it could be said that  while class struggle was already diminishing and the need to  strengthen the economy was growing, we were still continuing to  practice and preach the importance of class struggle. This  meant not only that we lost a very good opportunity to develop  the economy, but also that we lost an excellent chance to break  the fetters of tradition and create a new theoretical pattern.    The above is a historical perspective on the traditional  concept of socialism. This concept of socialism has its  rationality, i.e. when class struggle becomes an important  reality and when the only means open to the proletariat for  emancipating itself from exploitation is through revolution and  dictatorship, then this interpretation is correct. However,  when the proletariat has already been emancipated from  exploitation and it needs to greatly enhance productive capacity  in order to significantly increase material and spiritual  civilization and thereby create conditions for its own continued  emancipation, then this concept is not completely correct, or is  incorrect. In such circumstances one needs to take as the  centerpiece of this theory the conditions required for the  continued emancipation of the proletariat as espoused, but never  developed, by Marx and Engels at the time. Moreover, they should  be creatively developed by incorporating the special features of  this new age and the circumstances of each particular country.    The concept of socialism as conveyed by Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics is such a concept of socialism. This concept of  socialism takes the liberation and development of productive  forces as the turning point, the establishment of a high degree  of material culture and spiritual enlightenment as the condition  and the elimination of polarization and the creation of common  prosperity as the goal in establishing its basic theoretical  framework.    Through reading the related works of Comrade Deng Xiaoping,  especially Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, we can understand that since the Third Plenary  Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's constant pondering of questions relating to Marxism,  communism and socialism all concern that of developing  productive forces. In June 1984, in a discussion with Japanese  friends, he said: "What is socialism? What is Marxism? In the  past our understanding of these questions was not entirely  clear. Marxism attaches the greatest importance to developing  productive forces. We state that socialism is the initial stage  of communism and that when a higher stage of communism is  achieved then we must implement the practice of from each  according to his ability, to each according to his need. To do  this society needs highly developed productive forces and an  abundance of material goods and wealth. Therefore, the most  fundamental task of socialism is to develop productive forces.  The superiority of socialism is, in the final analysis,  embodied in its ability to develop productive forces faster and  better than the capitalist system and, moreover, on the basis of  developing productive capacity, to constantly improve the  material well-being of the people." (Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping, Vol 3, p 63. Hereinafter, quotations from  this work will be designated by the page number only) In August  1985, Comrade Deng, at a meeting with Prime Minister of Zimbabwe  Robert Mugabe, said: "We have summarized the experiences of  several decades of practicing socialism. In the past we were  not absolutely clear what socialism and Marxism were. Another  word for Marxism is communism. Our struggle over many years has  been for communism, our ideal is to achieve communism. During  our most difficult periods the ideal of communism was our  spiritual pillar. Countless people sacrificed themselves for  this ideal. Communism is a society without exploitation, a  society abundant in goods which practices the principle of from  each according to his ability, to each according to his need.  Unless conditions exist for material abundance then one cannot  put into effect the principle of to each according to his need.  In order to implement communism it is absolutely necessary to  complete all the tasks in the socialist stage. The tasks  involved in building socialism are many; however, the most basic  is to develop productive forces. On the basis of developing  productive forces socialism will prove superior to capitalism  and will create the material basis for the implementation of  communism." (p 137) In October 1987, Comrade Deng Xiaoping,  during a meeting with Janos Kader, general secretary of the  Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, reiterated his viewpoint:  "Marxism is also called communism. The basic principle of  Marxism is to implement `from each according to his ability, to  each according to his work' in the socialist stage, and during  the communist period to implement `from each according to his  ability, to each according to his need.' To practice to each  according to his need requires an abundance of goods. Can this  be achieved in a poor society? Can communism be  poverty-stricken? On the basis of synthesizing these  experiences we have concluded that for the whole historical  stage of socialism the central task is to develop productive  forces. This is real Marxism." (pp 254-255) Similar assertions  are numerous. From these expositions we can see that Comrade  Deng Xiaoping has all along considered the question of  productive forces to be a key point in his theoretical  explorations on what is Marxism, what is communism and  socialism, and how to effectively build socialism in China,  thereby creating a new concept of socialism which is different  from the traditional concept. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theories  concerning the nature of socialism, the motivation for the  development of a socialist society and the guarantee for the  development of a socialist society form the cornerstone of a new  concept of socialism.   <H5>    The Cornerstone of a Theoretical Edifice </H5>   In an important talk given during an inspection in south  China in early 1992 Comrade Deng expounded a new view on the  nature of socialism. He said: "The intrinsic nature of  socialism is the liberation of productive forces, the  development of productive forces, the abolition of exploitation  and the eradication of polarization in order to reach the final  objective of common prosperity." (p 373) What is new about this  view? We can make a comparison with the traditional concept of  socialism. Although the traditional concept of socialism gives  no definition of the intrinsic nature of socialism,  nevertheless, over the years, the traditional viewpoint has  formed that the factors determining a socialist system are: 1)  The socialist system of public ownership; 2) to each according  to his work; 3) the dictatorship of the proletariat. These  three elements are generally considered to be the special  features highlighting the intrinsic nature of socialism.  Although these three elements are very important, nevertheless  this concept has a major weakness because it overlooks the  significance of productive forces and common prosperity. That  is to say, it overlooks the goal of socialism and overlooks the  material basis for achieving that goal.    What really is the goal of socialism? Over the years  countless high-minded people have made great sacrifices for the  cause of socialism, but why have they done so? Comrade Deng has  categorically answered this question by saying: "The goal of  socialism is to achieve common prosperity for the people of the  whole country without the polarization of society." (pp  110-111) In September 1986, in response to a question from the  American reporter Mike Wallace, Comrade Deng Xiaoping stressed  that the principle of socialism was common prosperity, and that  the prerequisite condition for achieving this was the  development of productive forces. He said: "During the  socialist period the most important task is to develop  productive forces so that society's material goods will continue  to expand and the people's livelihood will improve day by day in  such a way that the material conditions are created for  implementing communism. In the same way that one cannot have a  poor communist society, one cannot have a poor socialist  society. Getting rich is not a crime. However, what we call  getting rich differs from what you talk about. Socialist wealth  belongs to the people; the creation of wealth in a socialist  society is for the common good. The principles of socialism  are: 1) The development of production; 2) common prosperity."  (pp 171-172) From these pronouncements one can see that in his  theory on the intrinsic nature of socialism, Comrade Deng places  common prosperity and the development of productive forces as  its centerpiece, that the former is the goal and the latter is  the material basis required for achieving this goal. If there  is no development of productive forces to create a material  base, then common prosperity is merely empty words. Therefore,  of these two points, developing productive forces is more  fundamental. This is why Comrade Deng sees development of  productive forces as the "most fundamental task" (p 63), the  "primary task" (p 116), and the "central task" (p 131) of  socialism, as well as the criterion for assessing right and  wrong, gains and losses. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has not only  linked the development of productive forces to the intrinsic  nature of socialism, but also linked it to the future and  destiny of socialism. He emphasized: "Our country's overriding  task at the present time is to wholeheartedly carry out the four  modernizations. We have given full rein to the intrinsic  features of socialism and even employed certain capitalist  methods (employing them as methods only) to speed up the  development of productive forces." He added: "China has no  choice but to take this path. Only this path can lead to  prosperity and boom." (pp 149-150) It can be clearly seen from  the above that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's viewpoint on the  intrinsic nature of socialism is different from that of the  traditionalists. The traditional view of socialism omitted the  two principles concerning the goal of socialism--common  prosperity and the material base, i.e. the development of  productive forces, needed to achieve that goal. Consequently,  the traditional concept of socialism was inaccurate and  incomplete.    The establishment of the ideas outlined above means that on  this most important question of what socialism is, Comrade Deng  has shown the difference between his concept of socialism and  that of the traditional socialist and that of traditional  Marxism. This has laid a firm foundation for the concept of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics.</p>

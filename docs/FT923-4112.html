			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Gonzalez move rejected THE Spanish parliament yesterday turned down an attempt by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and his government to ratify the Maastricht Treaty before the French referendum on the Treaty on September 20. The move robs Mr Gonzalez, who has already intervened personally in the French debate, of a further opportunity to signal Spain's enthusiasm for Maastricht to French voters. However, the Spanish parliament had not been expected to agree to hasty ratification. Although the Socialists have half the seats in the parliament, the parliamentary party saw little to be gained by forcing an early vote. Spanish ratification is a virtual certainty, as there is little opposition to Maastricht. A first step was taken this summer when parliament voted to adapt the constitution to the treaty by agreeing to allow foreigners to vote in local elections. The only difficulty in allowing ratification to take longer is that parliamentary debate could be delayed until next year and become embroiled in electioneering. Mr Gonzalez has to hold a general election by October 1993 and could call it next spring. However, European union promises little trouble politically for the government. Practically all the parties and the main union leaders support the EC treaty changes agreed last December. Opposition parties and the trades unions are having difficulty turning Mr Gonzalez' support for Maastricht, and his contribution to President Francois Mitterrand's campaign, to their advantage. Their best effort has been to attack him for being 'undemocratic' because of his refusal to call a referendum, thereby denying Spaniards the opportunity to vote Yes. The government has no intention of calling a referendum. Facing quite severe economic trouble, it fears a referendum campaign would quickly turn into a general election warm-up. Mr Javier Solana, the foreign minister, said this week that Spain would ratify Maastricht even if the French voted No this month.</p>

			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> SOVIET PARTY TAKES MEDVEDEV BACK  </P> <P> The Communist Party has restored membership to dissident historian Roy A.  Medvedev, whose writings about the personality cult of dictator Josef Stalin  prompted his expulsion in 1969, Tass said today.  </P> <P> Medvedev had asked the party's Central Committee Control Committee to be  restored as a party member, and the request was approved, the official news  agency said without giving a date for the action. Like many Soviets who had  fallen out of official favor, Medvedev has gradually been restored to good  graces. He was elected April 9 as a deputy to the new Soviet parliament, the  Congress of People's Deputies.  </P></p>

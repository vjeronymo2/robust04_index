			<p>BFN     [Text] North Korea has pushed ahead with the development of  nuclear weapons since 1986 and now has a considerable amount of  plutonium. This was revealed by Kim Tae-ho, who defected  recently to the South, during a press conference held at the  Seoul Press Center this afternoon. Before he defected, Mr. Kim  was the head of a work team at the Sanamchon Chemical Complex, a  uranium refinery plant under the North Korean Ministry of  Nuclear Energy. Mr. Kim said North Korea began to develop  nuclear weapons in 1986 and was able to produce plutonium in  1988.    Mr. Kim, who escaped from North Korea on 2 February because  the North Korean authorities became aware of the fact that he  misappropriated $5,000 in foreign currency, said plutonium has  been continuously produced in the nuclear facilities in  Yongbyon. He claimed that although he does not know whether  North Korea has a nuclear weapon, North Korea has attained a  considerable technological standard for the development of  nuclear weapons.    Meanwhile, brothers Hwang Kwang-chol and Hwang Kwang-il said  they crossed the border to China last June because they were  caught stealing food and lived a life of those who enter China  illegally. Elder brother Hwang Kwang-chol, 20, said that because  of the haphazard food rationing in North Korea, stealing food is  a frequent practice there.</p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Patten moves to seize initiative over controversy MR JOHN PATTEN, the education secretary, yesterday sought to regain the initiative in the controversy over testing in schools by writing to all Conservative MPs to explain why a boycott by teachers would damage the prospect of further improvements to the government's education reforms, Alison Smith writes. In a letter to his colleagues, Mr Patten acknowledged that there were a range of concerns among teachers, and he said that his announcement in February of a review of testing and also of the national curriculum was in response to those views. That review would be hindered if there were no results available from this year's tests for it to consider, he argued. This view had also been emphasised by Sir Ron Dearing, who will chair the review. Mr Patten said that the English tests for 14-year-olds, which are due to start this summer, had been the subject of particular anxiety. He accused the NUT and the NASUWT teachers' unions of exploiting concern about those tests in their plans to boycott all the tests. Opening his attack well in advance of the boycott itself, Mr Patten described any such action as 'counter-productive and unnecessarily damaging, including to the professional standing of teachers'.</p>

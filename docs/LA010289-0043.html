			<p><P> January 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> TREATMENT EFFECTIVE AGAINST BREAST CANCER  </P> <P> The combined results of 61 studies involving nearly 29,000 women establish  "beyond reasonable doubt" that drug and hormone treatment after surgery can  save the lives of many victims of early breast cancer, researchers say.  </P> <P> The analysis shows that during the five years after treatment begins, a  synthetic hormone called tamoxifen reduces the odds of death among older women  by about one-fifth. For women under age 50, a combination of chemotherapy drugs  reduces the odds by about one-quarter.  </P> <P> Dr. I. Craig Henderson of the Dana-Farber Cancer Center in Boston, one of 79  co-authors of the report last week's New England Journal of Medicine, said that  the treatments do not necessarily cure these women but "substantially delay  death."  </P> <P> National Institutes of Health recommended in 1985 that tamoxifen and  chemotherapy be used for breast cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes. In  May, 1988, the National Cancer Institute told doctors that this treatment could  be extended to women in the earliest stages of breast cancer that is not yet  evident in the lymph nodes. The institute based its recommendation on three  unpublished studies showing that cancer was slower to return when these women  were treated after surgery.  </P></p>

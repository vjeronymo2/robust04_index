			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA LETTERS;  </P> <P> THE NEW PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS  </P> <P> Americans have developed a fascination with the homeless. A while back, The  Times View section ran a story about a homeless man, neither the stereotyped  beggar nor the a cappella crazy talking to himself but a scholar without a  university position or research grant out on the street. Forty-seven-year-old  Irvin Matus was researching a book at the Folger Shakespeare Library in  Washington, without a place to live.  </P> <P> Matus was not the first of the celebrity homeless. Billy Boggs, a New York City  bag woman appropriated the name of a local male television personality and  first refused Mayor Koch's invitation and then resisted his coercion to enter a  shelter. Briefly famous after an article in People, she appeared on the  "Donahue" show and was asked to lecture at Harvard on her street experiences.  Film offers followed until she was discovered back on the street cursing at  passers-by.  </P> <P> In a March 1, 1989, editorial, the New York Times described a surreal  interaction at Grand Central Station between homeless people and some realistic  sculptures made to look like homeless people by artists like George Segal and  Duane Hansen. Complete, for the moment, with its own aesthetic, homelessness  has found its way out of the shadows and into a half-way zone between  frustrated social concern and spectacle. The aesthetic is indispensable.  </P> <P> Although more visible during the Reagan years, homelessness is not a phenomenon  of the '80s but the stubborn underside of the modern dream of steady  uninterrupted progress. In the summer of 1902, Jack London observed and wrote  about similar conditions in England. London's model for his study, which he  entitled "People of the Abyss," was W. T. Stead's best-selling expose, "If  Christ Came to Chicago" (1894). An Englishman, Stead had come to America during  the Columbian Exposition, a celebration of technology and American power, and  had walked along the edge of the great fair to report mass homelessness and  urban dislocation. So great was the problem of housing that thousands were  compelled to sleep each night in Chicago's elaborate new city hall. Returning  the favor, London wrote about his experiences among the English poor in "People  of the Abyss," republished in a handsome, edition by Joseph Simon.  </P> <P> London's work is a classic literary treatment of the underside of urban life,  the nightmare that continues to disturb our glamour-fantasies of leveraged  buyouts and endless nights on the town. For London, an American pragmatist in  the rigorous sense of the word that his contemporary William James employed,  "theories become instruments, not answers to enigmas, in which we can rest."  London neither moralizes about poverty nor generalizes his feelings but  dresses, instead, in the old clothes of a common sailor and lives on the street  in order to report an alien condition. He makes sharp distinctions,  distinguishing between working poor and indigent, between the tramp perpetually  looking for work and the bum hopeless of ever finding it.  </P> <P> For London, the homeless are not a people apart, a roving army assaulting us  alternately for charity or for pity. No, they are unadorned versions of  ourselves driven to extremes. Neither contemptuous nor sentimental, London's  letters from this time (Stanford University Press, 1988) reveal a man  struggling to face the facts about something that he once arrogantly thought he  knew. Initiated as a quick project to publish a new book, to get away from a  bad marriage and make some money, "People of the Abyss" begins to claim him.  Posing as an East London local (anticipating the antics of Dan Rather costumed  as an Afghan freedom fighter or Geraldo Rivera on a drug bust), Jack London,  already famous as a legitimate adventurer and radical, finds when out on the  street himself that "the human soul is a lonely thing." Even with some gold  coins sewn into the lining of his coat, he imagines the terror of unrelieved  poverty. London describes for Anna Strunsky, a former lover back home, what has  been happening to him. He writes, "You can live by theory, and therein you  approach perfection. I blunder at living by theory. At first I did too much  living by practice. They failed to catch me when I was young. . . . I have seen  men's eyes here, &amp; women's, that I was almost afraid to look in -- not  because of the viciousness therein, nor the sensuality, or anything of the  sort, but because of the utter lack of all these, because of the supreme  bestiality or unhumanness."  </P> <P> In the current period of transition between the years of greed that  characterized the '80s and the advertised new gentleness of the Bush '90s,  reading "People of the Abyss" is not a bad exercise. Jack London provides a way  to examine our own motives. In a letter to some friends, he hints at a method  for understanding what surrounds us today. He writes: "I've read of misery, and  seen a bit; but this beats anything I could even have imagined. Actually, I  have seen things, &amp; looked the second time in order to convince myself that  it was really so."  </P> <P> Looking the second time is critical. Seeing twice within the same short moment  forces us out of our habitual stances of piety, sentimentality or annoyance.  When we keep our eyes fixed until we see, we risk reconsidering some seemingly  fixed notions of family life and the moral causes of poverty.  </P> <P> What London saw was the flower of the English countryside blighted by life in  the city. He reports, "Year by year, and decade after decade, rural England  pours in a flood of vigorous strong life." But that vigor "not only does not  renew itself, but perishes by the third generation." Stripping himself of his  own sentimentality, London sees beyond the feelings he wants to entertain. The  people he interviews and spends time with are lost. He reports the toll of  having to live off handouts and unreliable public charity. Herded about day  after day, denied adequate shelter but forbidden to sleep in the parks, "the  dominant note of their lives is materialistic. They are stupid and heavy  without imagination." The Abyss becomes a "huge killing machine."  </P> <P> Written at the beginning of the century, London's work still carries the  passion of a man unafraid to question his own assumptions. The twin addictions  of our culture to irony and narcissism make it difficult to match him in  confronting something as refractory and unpleasant as homelessness. In one  mode, we tend to affect a sophisticated note of knowing unconcern, while in the  other, we tell each other how bad the last unpleasant street encounter made us  feel. London's work remains valuable because it forces us to re-imagine  homelessness as more than a social problem for the few unfortunates. In  demythologizing progress, or its New World variant the "American Dream," he  allows us to see ourselves as part of a problem and not apart from it. By  dressing up and voyaging down, he explores the depressive side of a society,  like ours, always looking for a quick fix or release from the terror of the  soul.  </P></p>

Following that the Islamic Republic of Iran's membership in GATT  has been seriously considered by our nation's policymakers and  officials. Conflicting views and explanations have been  presented on this matter. Firuz Dowlatabadi, the Foreign  Ministry's economic adviser and chief of its Office of Economic  and Strategic Coordination, gave an interview to our  correspondent in which he presented his views on this matter,  the details of which are presented for you below:    The foreign minister's economic adviser discussed the  effects  and consequences of joining GATT. He said: International  economic organizations cannot actually be evaluated on the basis  of whether joining them has benefits or disadvantages.    International organizations, especially international  economic organizations, are formed on the basis of a win-win  strategy. Therefore, consensus is a principle in these  organizations, and without a consensus their decisions are not  implemented.    Dowlatabadi said: Membership in these organizations  basically  faces the profitability of the economic system of each country,  and Iran will not be harmed by joining these organizations in  the way that is being mentioned. However, one must assess the  level of relative advantages in Iran and other nations of our  country's steadfastness and determination and the level of the  relative advantages that are in general unavailable to us and  are available to the other member nations.    What will the future of their behavior be towards us in  accordance with the government's policies, whether financial,  monetary, foreign exchange or in commercial policy, and how far  behind are we in this matter, or how far ahead of them are we?    The chief of the Foreign Ministry's Office of Economic and  Strategic Cooperation emphasized: This kind of assesment is the  basis for our estimate of the benefits or disadvantages to GATT  membership. It is really improper for us to ask whether we will  profit or lose by joining GATT, or to ask in what areas we will  profit and in what areas we will lose.    He said: Because our assessment of GATT membership has been  mistaken, despite the fact that the question of joining GATT has  been under discussion continuously for almost 20 years (since  the time before the revolution), no suitable conclusion has been  reached.    The foreign minister's economic adviser noted: In  international relations, if a country has the power to provide  expert counsel and if it has more political and economic  capacity, due to the fact that it has more factors for limiting  trade, it will in turn make more profit.    He noted: One reason we have not gotten the necessary  prerogatives to match the nation's political capacity in  economic negotiations is our weak foundation of expert knowledge  (consultative). Our expert system does not have the necessary  capacity. Because negotiations do not take place at the level of  ministers, deputy ministers or general managers, the weakness of  expert knowledge has kept us from having the power to do the  necessary bargaining, and has prevented us from having the  ability to make use of negotiations.    The chief of the Foreign Ministry's Office of Economic and  Strategic Cooperation added: Of course, GATT membership cannot  be proposed as a means of overcoming this deficiency, but to  compensate for this problem an acceptable level of privileges  must be designated for the experts who participate in the  negotiations, and they must not be allowed to depart from this  framework.    He said: During the process of joining, very close and  active  cooperation must exist between the legislative and executive  powers. With support from the law makers we can make the process  of joining GATT lawful.    The foreign minister's economic adviser was asked whether  there are obstacles to GATT membership in the Constitution. He  said: There is no obstacle to GATT membership in the  Constitution. Of course, support for some goods is provided in  the Constitution and prohibitions are given on imports of some  goods, and in this regard it is necessary to have cooperation  between the legislative and executive powers.    For example, the level of the Majles's willingness to  support  industries in this year's budget law was such that the Majles  added 10 percent to the taxes on imported vehicles.    He added: We will not be able to do this at this rate in the  budget law if we join GATT, and if we join GATT any increase in  tariffs will have to be done through negotiations with other  members.    Dowlatabadi was asked whether aggressor foreign countries  would become active in our country's banking and service affairs  in the event of our GATT membership. He said: If we become a  member, foreign banks will not necessarily become active in our  country. There are many countries, such as Pakistan and  Malaysia, where foreign banks cannot operate despite the fact  that those countries are GATT members.    He emphasized: There are provisions in GATT that allow that  in countries where there are legal obstacles negotiations will  be held and they will be made exceptions to the list of  provisions in the agreement.    The chief of the Foreign Ministry's Office of Economic and  Strategic Cooperation discussed the short-term and long-term  effects of GATT membership. He said: Basically, the process of  acquiring GATT membership is not a short-term process. It takes  at least five years. There can, therefore, be no short-term  analysis of this subject. This certainly has to do with our  long-term behavior.    Continuing, he added: In my view, our country will  definitely  profit from GATT membership and there will be no loss in the  event we join.    Dowlatabadi discussed the formation of a national committee  to study Iran's membership in GATT. He said: I recommend that a  group from the Majles become members of this committee and that  the request for Iran's membership in GATT be pursued rapidly.  The members of the expert negotiation team must be selected.  Iran's strategy for GATT membership must be specified,  especially in areas that have to do with our newly established  support system for exports, production and industries, and it  must be given to the expert team so they will know on the basis  of which items to pursue negotiations. More important is that  there must be continuous and active cooperation between the  legislative and executive powers for the study of GATT  membership.    He emphasized: That illogical fear among policymakers and  that illogical question concerning the profits and losses of  GATT membership must be cleared from the minds of policymakers,  and the process of GATT membership must be seriously pursued.    Dowlatabadi was asked whether we should take fundamental  steps in the nation's economy and then become a member of GATT,  or whether we could join it under current circumstances. He  said: Joining GATT is not dependent on any circumstances.  Nations are members of this organization with the strongest and  the weakest economic foundations. The economic structure of a  nation is not something that can be strengthened in the short  term.    He was asked, in view of the fact that our country is mainly  an importer of agricultural products and that our only export is  oil, which is not related to GATT issues, and that in a few  years the nation's import tariffs would have to be lowered and  the payment of subsidies would gradually have to be stopped,  whether joining would damage the nation's economy. He said: Our  system of tariffs is not efficient, and our tariffs in the  agricultural sector are quite low, even lower than GATT. At the  same time, in other countries the existing tariff percentage is  efficient and effective, and a decrease of several percentage  points will have a great effect on the nation's economy, while  this is not the case in our economy. Most of the tariff  pressures are on the government itself. If we become a member of  GATT we will be able to give greater support to the agricultural  sector.    He added: There is also a 10- to 15-year period allowed to  reduce subsidies. In this regard it is much better for our  economic system to be put under pressure and to bring itself to  the designated stage by that time.    The Foreign Ministry's economic adviser emphasized: There is  no problem regarding the reduction of tariffs in Iran. Tariffs  are no problem in our economic system. Even in a nontariff  system, our nontariff supports are quite low compared to  international members.    The chief of the Foreign Ministry's Office of Economic and  Strategic Coordination discussed the effects of this agreement  on regional economic pacts such as ECO [Economic Cooperation  Organization]. He said: GATT includes an exception for regional  cooperation. These regional cooperation pacts can exist with any  kind of preferential tariff. Therefore, there is no obstacle in  this and it encourages GATT at the outset. At the same time our  economic activity has not yet taken efficient shape in ECO or  any other framework in which it is felt that GATT might be  harmful.    Dowlatabadi was asked whether the fact that America and the  Zionist regime are GATT members with most-favored nation status  might bring about the creation of relations with them. He said:  In the preliminary negotiations one can make some countries  exceptions to economic relations, and the membership of these  two nations is no obstacle to joining GATT.</p>

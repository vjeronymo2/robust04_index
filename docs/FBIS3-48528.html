			<p>Language: <F P=105>Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by First Prime Minister Prince Krompreah Norodom </F> Ranariddh at the University of Fine Arts in Phnom Penh on 25  January -- recorded]    [Summary From Poor Reception] I assure you that the Royal  Government will try to solve problems while taking the interests  of our compatriot traders into account. Whatever I do is in the  name of the Royal Government. There have been cases when it was  said that problems could not be solved; yet the Royal Government  solved them without any demonstrations occurring. But there is  no need to praise Ranariddh or say that he is a hero.    There are still many problems to be solved, such as the  schools lacking textbooks and teachers, poverty in rural areas,  insecurity, and so forth. We should not focus exclusively on  the problems with the Olympic Market. The problem will be  solved without putting Cambodia's interests at risk. This  should be done properly. I am very concerned about unauthorized  checkpoints. This is a problem we must solve. I urge all of  you to be considerate and sympathetic to the Royal Government.  Show the international community that Cambodia has no problems;  that we have social and political stability.</p>

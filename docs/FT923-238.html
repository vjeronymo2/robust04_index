			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (3): Teacher does know best MACRO ECONOMICS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY by Jeffrey Sachs and Felipe Larrain B. Prentice Hall HOW DOES he find the time? Mr Jeffrey Sachs is best known as the West's principle economic fire-fighter, dousing various inflationary blazes across eastern Europe and Latin America, but he is primarily an academic economist at Harvard University in the US, a teacher and now a successful textbook author, too. Macro Economics in the Global Economy is an impressive achievement. Sachs, with his co-author, Felipe Larrain, of the Pontificia Universitidad Catolica de Chile, has managed to instill much of his knowledge and experience of policy-making into a readable textbook for intermediate undergraduates. This is not of the usual textbook school - turgid, dry, parochial and divorced from the real world. For scores of European students, who have been forced up to now to study from US-centric economic texts, this book will bring welcome relief. It is innovative in three main ways: from the outset it takes an international perspective, recognising that in today's inter-dependent world of free-flowing capital and exchange rate fluctuations, no economy can be studied in isolation from its trading partners, even the US. it focuses on the importance of institutional differences - in wage-setting or the making of monetary policy - in explaining cross-country variations in national economic forms. rather than simplifying by excluding, it incorporates the most modern theory and tackles difficult issues in an accessible way. It is not an easy read - 750 pages, many of which contain algebra as well as words and pictures, may put off readers who are not required to study it by apparently over-zealous professors. However, that would be a mistake. It is a book that repays effort. The bulk of the text breathes life into the basic theory of international macro economics, using many empirical and real world applications. But it is in the final five chapters that it excels. Covering the making of economic policy, financial markets, traded and non-traded goods, the developing country debt crisis and stabilisation in high inflation countries, they are superb examples of how to combine theory, evidence and experience in explaining economics.</p>

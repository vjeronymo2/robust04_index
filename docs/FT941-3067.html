			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / International Bonds: Philips returns to market Philips, the Dutch electronics group which this month announced a return to profit in 1993 and its first dividend since 1990, returned to the international bond market yesterday after an absence of six years with a FFr1bn offering of eight-year Eurobonds. A Philips spokesman said the proceeds of the transaction would be kept in French francs and used for general corporate purposes. He added that Philips had chosen to make its return in the French franc sector because it was the most receptive to long maturities from corporate borrowers. Syndicate managers said Philips' bonds were correctly priced at a yield spread of 85 basis points over the 8 1/2 per cent French government bond due 2002, and that the spread met current demand among investors for decent returns. They added that a further attraction was the likelihood that Philips' fortunes would continue to improve. Lead manager CCF said domestic investors took up around half of the bonds which it sold yesterday, while the other half were sold to investors in Germany, Benelux and Switzerland. When the bonds were freed to trade, they slipped from a fixed re-offer price of 99.55 to 99.20, in line with weakness in the underlying market. The spread widened by one basis point. Elsewhere, New Zealand's successful issue of floating-rate notes on Tuesday prompted two further five-year FRN offerings, one of Dollars 500m from Hydro-Quebec and the other of Dollars 150m from Instituto Nacional de Industria (INI), the Spanish state industrial holding company. The tighter pricing on INI's offering, which was off its Euro medium-term note programme, reflected its superior credit rating. Some syndicate managers feared that the FRN market was close to saturation following the recent rush of offerings. The World Bank followed the European Investment Bank's footsteps into the Greek drachma sector yesterday when it launched a Dr15bn offering of three-year Eurobonds. The proceeds of the transaction were swapped into dollars. The World Bank said the deal reflected its policy of constantly trying to diversify its funding sources and investor groups. In addition, the bank had achieved an attractive cost of funds on an after-swap basis. Lead manager Midland Bank Athens said the high coupon on the bonds of 15 1/2 per cent appealed mainly to continental investors. When the bonds were freed to trade, they rose from an issue price of 100 7/8 to 103 1/4 . Bank for Dutch Municipalities took advantage of demand among Benelux retail investors for short-dated Canadian dollar bonds by issuing a CDollars 150m offering of three-year Eurobonds. Lead manager ABN-Amro said it had sold over half of its commitment, around one-third of the total amount, by the close of trading. The bonds closed unchanged at their fixed re-offer price of 99.86.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Jun 26 (ANEX-ANTARA) -- The Agriculture  Ministry's Director General of Food Crops Amrin Kahar said that  drought besetting certain areas in Indonesia was expected to  cause the national rice production to decrease by 2.7 percent of  48 million tons total production last year.    "Drought besetting several areas of the country is difficult  to predict as it has deviated from the long dry cycle," he told  the press after attending the opening ceremony of the sport week  to mark the Ministry's hari krida pertanian (outdoor activity  day).    The five year cycle of long dry season occured in 1972,  1977,  1982, and in 1987. It was predicted that 1992 would see a long  dry season but it did not and even in that year the rice  production increased by 7.8 percent from 47.5 million tons in  the previous year.    Drought is expected to plague hundreds of hectare rice  fields  in the Central Java cities of Wonogiri, Sragen, Cilacap, Demak  and in West Java cities of Indramayu, Cirebon and Bandung which  are all regarded as the breadbaskets.    Amrin proposed that farmers in the areas which are short of  water after rainy season should resort to planting crops which  need less water, such as corn and soybean.    The drought, however, will not threaten the Indonesia's  existing self-sufficiency in rice.    "Indonesia's rice production is still much bigger than that  of consumption. Besides, several neighbouring countries which  borrow Indonesia's rice will in the near future repay it so that  it can be used to secure the rice self-sufficiency," he said.</p>

			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Profits taken after Dow's recent gains Wall Street US share prices retreated from Friday's gains yesterday as traders took profits after last week's advance, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 16.49 off at 3,790.70. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 0.89 at 457.91, the American Stock Exchange composite eased 0.50 to 425.73 and the Nasdaq composite shed 1.16 to 727.91. New York Stock Exchange trading volume came to 272m shares. Analysts attributed much of last week's strength to Friday's 'triple-witching hour' when options and futures on stock indices expired together in the last 60 minutes of trading. With that out of the way and no important economic news out yesterday, there was little to push up the market. Investors were also acting cautiously in advance of today's meeting of the Federal Reserve's open market committee. Most analysts are betting that the Fed will not lift rates at the meeting, but opinion is not unanimous. Interest rate rises usually push the market down as investors worry that reduced consumption and borrowing will erode corporate earnings. In recent weeks the market has moved up and down skittishly as investors first worried about another rate rise and then bought when those fears subsided briefly. A round of relatively mild economic news put out last week led many to speculate that the Fed would not raise rates again before January. Caesars World rocketed Dollars 20 3/4 to Dollars 66 after ITT said it would acquire the casino company for Dollars 67.50 per share, or Dollars 1.7bn. ITT dipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 81 1/2 . US Shoe rose Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 19 after an investor group at the company said it would back the sale of its footwear business to Nine West, Dollars  3/8 firmer at Dollars 26 5/8 . Ben &amp; Jerry's fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 10 after the ice cream company announced that it expected a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 700,000 to Dollars 900,000 and a decline in revenues from the same period last year. Revenues should be about Dollars 30m, the company said. Canada Toronto stocks were no worse than mixed as Wall Street declined. Hearty gains in banking shares and golds provided the bulk of the fuel for a rise of 18.72 points to a closing 4,136.75 for the TSE 300 index. Declines and rises were almost evenly matched at 385 to 384 after volume of 55.7m shares. Ten of the 14 sub-indices advanced, led by gold, financial, communication and industrial-product stocks. Conglomerates, consumer products, oils and merchandising posted the biggest declines. The golds group added 0.91 per cent, even though the New York spot bullion price eased 35 cents to USDollars 379.75 an ounce. Mexico Equities finished sharply lower after reports came through of fresh trouble in the southern state of Chiapas. The IPC index dropped 95.93 or 4.12 per cent to 2,231.66  - at the end of 1993 it stood at 2,602.63. Volume was a modest 31.2m shares worth 390.4m new pesos. The Zapatista rebels said they had turned down an offer from the government of a multi-party commission to negotiate peace. Traders said key Mexican rates are likely to see increases at the central bank's weekly auction tomorrow because of nerves stemming from Chiapas.</p>

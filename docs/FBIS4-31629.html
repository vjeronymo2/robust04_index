			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jacek Safuta] </F>   [Excerpt] Istanbul, 10 Jun, PAP--At their meeting in  Istanbul on Friday, the foreign ministers of the NATO, Central  European, and former USSR states, who make up the so-called  North Atlantic Consultative Council [NACC], with unprecedented  stubbornness disputed the text of the final communique, which  extended the proceedings.    This pushed into the background the resolution of the nature  of relations between Russia and NATO, although the issue has  remained unclear. Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski  stressed in his speech on Friday that Poland is "aware of the  need for solid partnership between NATO and Russia," within and  beyond the Partnership for Peace, but he warned that this should  not lead to a "marginalizing of the smaller states, undermining  their trust in NATO." He also gave assurances that countries  such as Poland "want to join NATO not as frontline states but as  factors promoting further cooperation." [passage omitted]</p>

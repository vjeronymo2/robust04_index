			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE WON'T REINSTATE STAR 49ER WITH 1 KIDNEY  </P> <P> At 1:15 Monday afternoon, outside a federal courtroom in Los Angeles, Mark Seay  had hope as he awaited a hearing. If everything went well, he anticipated  playing football again for Cal State Long Beach, as soon as Saturday in a game  at Boise State.  </P> <P> "I hope they have room for me," he said. The remark was made jokingly because  the 49ers had lost two days before to Hawaii, 63-10, and it seemed plausible  they would welcome back a man who had been a star receiver last season until he  lost a kidney in a shooting at a children's Halloween party.  </P> <P> But less than an hour later, U. S. District Judge Ronald S. W. Lew refused to  grant a preliminary junction that would have allowed the 22-year-old junior to  rejoin the team. Lew said there was not clear proof that Seay's remaining  kidney is working normally.  </P> <P> Seay sat numbly after the decision, realizing he would not be playing at Boise  or anywhere this season. His attorney, Richard J. Foster, a 49er booster and  fund-raiser, tried to console him. They did not leave for several minutes.  </P> <P> "He was near tears," Foster said. "I told him it wasn't over, that it was the  beginning of the fourth quarter and a lot of teams pull it out in the fourth  quarter."  </P> <P> Last month, Seay sued the university because it would not allow him to play,  claiming that the risk to his remaining kidney was too great.  </P> <P> Despite Monday's setback, Foster said he is considering having the case proceed  to trial early next year. He said the burden of proof at a trial is less than  it is at a preliminary injunction hearing.  </P> <P> The attorney also said that Seay, who will retain his scholarship, may look  into the possibility of playing at another school.  </P> <P> Foster had hoped that the testimony of Dr. Stewart W. Shankel, a kidney  specialist at Loma Linda University, would be sufficient.  </P> <P> "Mark Seay's renal (kidney) function is stable," Shankel said in a declaration  filed with the court. "His creatinine clearance has been consistently between  72 and 80 (cubic centimeters per minute). While this clearance is somewhat low,  it is within acceptable limits for a person with one kidney." (Creatinine is a  byproduct of muscle metabolism and is excreted through the urine; the clearance  is a measure of kidney function.)  </P> <P> Shankel also said in a letter to Dr. Robert Austin, the 49ers' team physician,  that Seay was willing to take the risks of playing football with one kidney and  that he should be allowed to play.  </P> <P> But Austin recommended that Seay not be allowed to play. Austin has said that  Seay's kidney is not working properly and would be at substantial risk -- from  a hard blow to the back or from extreme physical exertion. Austin also said  Seay's creatinine clearance is half what it should be.  </P> <P> "Mark's kidney function is stable, not normal," Deputy Atty. Gen. Christopher  C. Foley, representing the university, said at the hearing. "We're not saying  he's an invalid. But is it medically advisable to play? The conservative  approach is appropriate."  </P> <P> CSULB Athletic Director Corey Johnson said Tuesday, "I felt all along the  institution had done the proper medical investigations and made the right  decision."  </P> <P> Foster had been encouraged before Monday's hearing. He said that Seay qualified  under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibits a university that  receives federal money from discriminating against an otherwise qualified  handicapped person. He said that, under the act, Seay, rather than the  university, should make the decision whether he should play.  </P> <P> Foster also pointed to a report by C.C. Calescibetta, a Long Beach kidney  specialist to whom the university sent Seay last March. Calescibetta had  recommended that Seay participate in track, not football. "(Track) is a sport  generally recognized to be more strenuous than football," Foster said.  </P> <P> Calescibetta also said that if Seay were allowed to play football, he should  wear a flak jacket. Foster said at the hearing Monday that the Douglas  Protective Equipment Co. of Houston would make a protective pad for Seay  similar to one it made for James Dixon, who has one kidney and played last  season as a wide receiver for the University of Houston.  </P> <P> The company claims that a person wearing the pad could be hit with a baseball  bat and not feel any pain.  </P> <P> But Foster said that the overriding issue is whether Seay's remaining kidney is  working properly. "He wants conclusive evidence," Foster said of Lew. "We can't  get him conclusive evidence."  </P> <P> Foster said that any hope of future success in the case probably will hinge on  whether Seay's kidney function increases, which Austin doubts.  </P> <P> "We will contact some sports medicine people to conduct extensive studies on  Mark," Foster said. "If they come in negative, Mark will have to make a  decision whether to pursue (the case)."  </P> <P> Foster accused the university of being "excessively conservative" and that it  feared Seay would sue if he played and were injured. The school rejected a  waiver offer, the attorney added.  </P> <P> "I think we came darn close (to winning)," Foster said. "I think the judge  really struggled with the decision."  </P> <P> Seay, who became a hero when he shielded his 2-year-old niece from gunfire at  the party last Halloween, said after the hearing that he was having a hard time  accepting Lew's decision.  </P> <P> "If I had won this case," Seay said, "I could live my life the way it used to  be."  </P></p>

			<p>Europe      Economic Review:  WESTERN EUROPE Vo1. III, No. 17, 02 May  1994      Notice To Readers:  FOREIGN MEDIA SURVEY is a series published by  FBIS Europe/Lat in America Group featuring brief summaries of  foreign  media reports on topical issues, compiled from the most recent  sources available to FBIS.      Europe Economic Review (EER) is a subseries of FOREIGN MEDIA  SURVEY published by the West and East European Divisions of  Europe/Lat in America Group with contributions from FBIS overseas  bureaus.  The EER is intended to supplement coverage of European  economic issues by the FBIS Daily Report for West and East Europe,  and other FBIS publications.  Foreign news, feature, and editorial  reports selected for summary in this publication normally do not  appear in other FBIS publications.      The EER is published in two editions, one for West Europe (also  including media coverage of Canada and Turkey), and the other for  Eastern Europe.  Drawing primarily from domestic media sources of  these countries but also using other foreign media where  appropriate, the EER focuses on national and regional economic  issues, such as economic competitiveness, regional economic  integration, economic reforms and other changes in economic  policies, and foreign trade and investment.      FOREIGN MEDIA SURVEY is a U.S. Government publication.  Its  contents in no way represent the policies, views, or attitudes of  the U.S. Government.  All comment or analysis contained herein is  attributable to the cited media source, unless otherwise indicated.     TABLE OF CONTENTS      INTRODUCTION      PARLIAMENT      THE COMMISSION      THE COURT OF JUSTICE      EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK      UNICE      EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY     CEDEFOP      THE DUBLIN FOUNDATION      EUROSTAT      Part I: Impact of EU Institutions on European Business      INTRODUCTION      This special issue of the West Europe Economic Review summarizes  a series of articles appearing in the Paris business daily LES ECHOS  from 5 January to 23 March 1994.  The articles discuss the main EU  institutions which affect the conduct of business in Europe, either  through their regulatory, advocacy, or consultative functions.  The  articles include interviews conducted by the authors with special  interest group spokespersons commenting on the advantages and  problems inherent in dealing with these institutions.      According to the articles, the Treaty of Rome, which founded the  European Community, largely ignored the business community--with the  exception of the steel, aircraft, and agriculture industries.  During the 1960's and 1970's the Community focused almost entirely  on agriculture.  However, with the advent of the Single Market in  January 1993, the Community made European industry a priority and  set out to coordinate and merge the various member state regulations  and laws which govern its conduct.  Moreover, the EU is now trying  to go a step further by providing national companies a means to  incorporate on a European level.  When the Maastricht Treaty was  ratified at the end of 1993, the authors claim the EU finally "put  business in its rightful place, neither forgotten nor privileged."  It made the European company one of the major components of European  Union, either directly through social welfare decisions, the  development of vocational training, and Community industrial policy  or indirectly in changing the framework of economic policy to  coordinate EU fiscal legislation in preparation for a single  currency. (Dian I. x733-6286)      EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT      Following the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, the  European Parliament has increased its scope of responsibility,  extending its ability to participate in legislative decisionmaking,  budget control, and oversight duties--a fact European companies are  poised to take advantage of, according to Strasbourg special  correspondent Jacques Docquiert in the 26 January edition of LES  ECHOS.  These companies are intensifying their lobbying efforts in  the halls of Parliament and a representative of a large European  company claims it is more and more often in Strasbourg, seat of the  Parliament, that future EU regulations are made or unmade.  This  company representative argues that for European business to ignore  Parliament, "which is still too often the case, is to misunderstand  the Community decisionmaking process and to deprive oneself of the  opportunity to influence Eurodeputies, who are often more sensitive  to the interests of public opinion than of the Eurocrats" in  Brussels.      Interview With Bruno Dupont, President of Euralia      Bruno Dupont, CEO of small business lobbying group Euralia, notes  that the extension of Parliamentary authority after Maastricht  Treaty ratification included the oversight of EU industrial policy.  He maintains that while most companies have not yet realized this,  it is fundamental for those firms which want not only to anticipate  regulatory changes but also to evaluate their impact on company  plans, to make discussion with EU deputies integral to their  interaction with the Community.  British companies have already  largely taken into account Parliament's increased power over issues  as sensitive as financial services, technology, and the environment.  Dupont additionally suggests that all EU medium- and large-sized  companies should make their views known to Parliament independently  from their professional federations and associations, which can only  act in consensus on issues.      Asked about Parliament's current priorities that affect EU  companies, Dupont made the point that EU deputies are distributed  among 10 policy groups and 18 permanent commissions.  The priorities  of each deputy will depend on which group or commission he is a  member of.  Additionally, each deputy must be accountable to his own  member state and priorities will be influenced by the diversity of  these representatives.  Traditionally, Dupont states, consumer  protection and the environment have always been two permanent  priorities of the Parliament which directly concern companies.      In Dupont's view, the major issue today for the Parliament which  will affect companies is unemployment.  He sees the Parliament as  being called on to foster an improved business climate by changing  direct and indirect taxation, clarifying competition policy,  providing transparency in EU legal coordination, and making such  coordination profitable for companies.  On the other hand, the  Parliament will be asked to integrate further small business into  the Community by opening government markets to them and allowing  them wider participation in EU programs.      THE COMMISSION      According to Jacques Docquiert, writing on 12 January, the  Commission is the key institution of the European Union and has a  long tradition of contacts with businesses.  He points out that the  Maastricht Treaty has not changed the Commission's scope of  authority or its relationship with professional federations.  Its  mission under the Treaty of Rome is intact: to propose legislation  and regulations to the Council of Ministers to provide for the  smooth functioning and the development of Community policies.  The  Commission is supported by a strong bureaucracy of some 16,700  employees coming from each member state and divided into 23 General  Directorates.  These "Eurocrats" and their institution have for some  years been accused of usurping power, overregulating EU business,  and "all sorts of evils" by adversaries of the Brussels technocracy.  The reality is different, Docquiert claims.  Although the  Commission, in addition to the 726 bills it had written since its  inception to the end of 1990, had to submit 380 supplementary bills  to the Council of Ministers for consideration between 1989 and 1992  to prepare for the Single Market, it is in fact, only the Council of  Ministers that has decisionmaking authority in 80 percent of  Community matters.  Moreover, the Maastricht Treaty's new concept of  subsidiarity, under which legislation is handled at the member state  level and only reaches the Community level if it cannot be resolved,  should put an end to this "Eurocratic regulatory bulemia," Docquiert  claims.      The Commission and Business      "The dialogue between the Commission and the business community  functioned well before the Maastricht Treaty," notes Riccardo  Perissich, director general of the Industrial Affairs and Internal  Market Directorate, the DG3, "and should continue to function  smoothly."  However, Perissich points out that there is no model to  follow and no single office to go to to have action taken on an  issue.  A company representative arriving in Brussels where the  Commission is located and can be derailed by the number of actors  and directorates working on the same directive proposal, Perissich  acknowledged.      Companies or professional groups which are just starting to lobby  the Commission must first learn where to go and whom to approach.  The Commission has traditionally dealt with EU federations or  industry associations, which cooperate to defend a common position  with varying success depending on the industry.  The chemical,  pharmaceutical, and steel industries for example, rely on old  traditions "perfectly broken in."  In other industries, such a  tradition does not exist and national federations or individual  companies must seek out Eurocrats to lobby in order to change  opinions or push a certain agenda.  This lobbying can take three  forms: appoint a European representative within the company, open a  bureau in Brussels, or use a legal firm or consultants on an ad hoc  basis.  The choice often depends on the financial means of the  company.  Perissich contends that small and medium-sized companies  are disadvantaged in this effort and must often rely on national  industrial federations to plead their cases.  Docquiert notes that  French companies have been late to open bureaus in Brussels, doing  so only at the end of the 1980's, considerably later than their  counterparts in Germany and in Britain.      Interview With Etienne Crespel, Director of the Permanent  Representative Office of Alcatel-Alsthom      Etienne Crespel, head of lobbying efforts for France's  electronics firm Alcatel-Alsthom, points out that computer and  telecommunications manufacturers have for several years met together  in a round table, with the approval of the Commission, to consult  and devise strategic policies.  He refutes those who say French  companies began lobbying "a little too late," noting that before the  Single Market Act was signed in 1986, EU regulatory evolution was  slow and not sufficient to closely monitor the Commission's work.  However, with the advent of the Single Market in 1991, the pace of  regulation and EU directives has picked up to the extent that large  French industrial companies have decided to establish bureaus in  Brussels.      THE COURT OF JUSTICE      Isabelle Graviere writes on 19 January that the Court of Justice,  which was created in 1952 and oversees EU treaties and the  harmonization of Community legislation, arbitrates disputes between  EU companies and the Commission, a member state, or a competing  company.  The Court meets every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday to  hear cases--on agriculture, competition, social policy, taxes,  transportation, labor issues--many of which directly concern  European companies.      The growth of the court's casework has grown parallel to that of  the Community itself.  It has heard 7,000 cases since 1952, covering  400 issues since 1978.  To cope with this flood of work, the Court  asked the Council to establish an additional court, which they did  in 1988.  The new court which aids the Court of Justice is called  the High Court.      Development of the High Court      The High Court, which had 635 pending cases at the end of 1993,  is also swamped, according to Graviere, and the length of  deliberations and the difficulty of agreeing on a final opinion  among judges of different countries, education, and languages may  discourage companies from bringing grievances to it.  French  companies, however, often bring cases before the High Court,  according to the French High Court judge Jacques Biancarelli, in  part because they have a more internationally driven corporate  strategy than do German and British companies.  However, German  companies traditionally have called on both the Court of Justice and  the High Court for issues such as taxation and the free movement of  companies.      The High Court is composed of 12 magistrates, each assisted by  one public auditor (soon two).  At the Court of Justice there are 13  judges, one per member state plus the president.  Each is assisted  by three public auditors and by six general attorneys.  In both  cases, the judges are named for a term of six years by common  agreement by the member states.  These terms are renewable.  Governmental agreement on judicial appointments, however, is no  guarantee of ultimate judicial consensus on different issues.  Disagreement often adds to the length of deliberations.      Interview With Hugues Calvet, Sales Vincent Georges &amp; Associates   Attorney      Hugues Calvet, refuting Biancarelli, claims that French companies  are not very active before the Court.  It is not that they have no  legal differences to settle, Calvet states, but that they are  "underdeveloped" when it comes to managing their legal affairs.  They tend to consider being contentious as being "parasitic" and  consequently a company legal strategy rarely exists to the extent it  does in Anglo-Saxon countries or even in Germany and the  Netherlands.      Nonetheless, the Community legal system represents a way for  companies to obtain a fair competitive environment.  Moreover,  Calvet notes, Court decisions which have declared French business  regulations as incompatible with European law have produced "attacks  of conscience" within the French Government.  One such case was when  the Court declared France could not forbid women from working at  night.  As a result of successfully challenging this French law,  companies realize that at the European level they can change the  legal framework within which they conduct business.  More often,  however, companies are concerned with integrating Community law into  their corporate practices in order to "avoid surprises" and  litigation.      In Calvet's view, the Court is very accessible.  He points out  that litigation before the Court is free, although the company must  support the cost of its lawyers.  Even though the duration of legal  procedures has lengthened over the last few years, it is comparable  to an equivalent litigation in national courts, and perhaps less  time-consuming.  Calvet adds that over the years, a number of  individuals and very small companies have won their cases from the  Court.      Cases Heard by the Courts      High Court:      --All cases brought against the Commission by "physical or moral  persons (particularly companies)," with the exception of antidumping  cases.     --CECA: cases brought against the Commission by virtue of the  Community Steel and Coal Treaty.      Court of Justice:      --Antidumping cases.     --Cases brought because of nonobservance of Community law by  member states.     --Incompetency cases: Cases brought before the Court because of  legal omissions by Community institutions.     --Prejudicial dismissals: National judges, in case of doubt about  the interpretation of Community law, can ask the Court for legal  interpretation.     --Appeals: Can be brought against any decisions handed down by  other courts.      EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK      Isabelle Graviere in the 2 February edition characterizes the  European Investment Bank (EIB) as the "first among European banks."  Indirectly for the small- and medium-size company projects, directly  for larger ones, the EIB contributes to financing an important share  of EU company investments.  As Europe's financial arm, the EIB is  without doubt one of the EU institutions with the most immediate  impact on EU companies.  This is the case, Graviere points out,  because the EIB loaned 19.6 billion European Currency Units (ECU's)  last year and 1.895 billion ECU's the year before for projects  involving EU firms.      The EIB's mission obligates it to finance investments which help  the Community realize its economic objectives: development or  "reconversion" of poor regions, which applies to nearly 40 percent  of its loans; loans to assist company competitiveness; support for  small- and medium-sized companies; development of trans-European  transportation, telecommunications, and energy networks;  environmental protection and improvement of the quality of life;  reduction of energy dependence; and the rational utilization of  natural resources.  To do this, the EIB uses several financial  "tools," which Graviere details below.      Individual Loans and Global Loans      The EIB directly funds up to 50 percent of the total loan  requirement for projects costing 17 million ECU's or more.  It also  provides lines of credit to financial organizations which in turn  lend to small- and medium-sized businesses or to local governments.  Such loans are under the supervision of the EIB.  Last year, 5,351  small- and medium-sized companies and 783 public works projects  initiated by local governments benefited from such credit for a  total of 2.6 billion ECU's loaned at competitive rates, made  available because the EIB takes no commission and is deemed to be a  AAA borrower by rating agencies.  According to EIB information  officer Henri Marty-Gauquie, France makes the most use of EIB loans.  To date, the EIB has made loans to 2,985 small French businesses and  480 French infrastructure projects.      Following the December 1992 European Council in Edinburgh, the  EIB created an additional funding pool of 5 billion ECU's which was  to be loaned out in 1993 and 1994.  In December 1993 the fund was  increased to 8 billion ECU's: 7 billion are destined for financing  investments for the trans-European transportation,  telecommunications, and energy networks and 1 billion for small  businesses at a preferred loan interest rate of 2 percent.  Of the 8  billion ECU's, 4.5 billion have been disbursed.  Graviere notes that  while politicians find this amount too small, EIB Vice President  Alain Prate defends the sum as a significant contribution to  investment effort.      Finally, the EIB is helping to establish the European Investment  Fund (EIF).  The ElF, which was created by the Council of Edinburgh  to guarantee infrastructure projects and small business investment,  will be a separate entity from the EIB.  It is currently being  ratified in Italy and in Greece and will become operational this  summer.  A team has begun to define the EIB's priorities and its  loan selection criteria, following methods practiced by the EIB.      The EIB employs 800 employees, split between a team of some 50  engineers who study the technical feasibility of projects, a  research department with 50 economists who verify their economic  viability and appropriateness for EIB funding, and some 100  financial experts in a dozen geographic teams who control the bank's  financial arrangements.      Interview With Patrice Compin, Caisse Centrale des Banques  Populaires      Patrice Compin, responsible for EIB relations at France's Caisse  Centrale des Banques Populaires, states that the EIB provides his  company an opportunity to take part in a European initiative.  Furthermore, the EIB guarantees the Caisse the ability to diversify  its debt structure and offers financing compatible with loans the  Caisse offers companies.  The EIB also allows the Caisse to borrow  at a cost 10 to 15 percent below that of the market.  Compin noted  that 14 of 30 regional banks in his group have agreements with the  EIB dating from 1992 which involve a total lending amount of 750  million francs (Fr).  To date, the EIB has dispersed Fr500 million  of that amount to finance some 986 projects.      Compin, in detailing the criteria for EIB financing, stated that  the size of the company must not surpass 500 employees and those  with less than 100 are a priority.  The cost of the project also  must not be more than 25 million ECU's to be eligible for loans  valued between 20,000 ECU's and 12.5 million ECU's.  Geographic  location is also a criteria since the EIB targets certain less-  developed regions or those in the process of converting their  industries.  Finally, the industry is important.  Currently the EIB  gives priority to industries which can save energy or preserve the  environment.      UNICE      Isabelle Graviere, writing on 5 January, describes the Union of  Industrial and Employers Confederations of Europe (UNICE) as a  representative body for employer organizations from 22 European  countries.  Since the Single Market was established, it has become  an active lobbyist at the EU Commission.  With the Maastricht Treaty  now ratified, along with its social agreement concluded by 11 of the  12 EU member states (Britain excepted), Graviere anticipates that  UNICE will have wider latitude to carry on a "social dialogue" with  other EU organizations.      The mission of UNICE today is essentially one of communication  and lobbying.  It must in effect inform its members of Community  projects, laws, and directives.  It must also present employers'  concernsto EU legislators before any definitive decision is made on  economic, fiscal, social, or legal matters which concerns its  members' companies or industries.  UNICE primarily lobbies the EU  Commission but also holds discussions with the Council, the  Parliament, and the Economic and Social Committee, which has  codecisionmaking authority on certain issues.  UNICE also deals with  EU institutions which are more specialized such as the Patent and  Trademark Office.      Working Practices      Headquartered in Brussels not far from the Commission, the small  40-odd permanent staff of UNICE organizes working meetings nearly  daily.  Twice a year the presidents of the member federations and  five UNICE vice presidents work out priority issues to be addressed.  The issues are then referred to any one of five commissions-  -economic and financial, foreign relations, social affairs,  industrial affairs, and company affairs--which meet three times a  year, and to more than some 50 technical groups which meet from two  to seven times a year according to the importance of each issue.      The permanent representative of some employers groups, such as  the National Confederation of French Employers (CNPF), also have  representative offices in Brussels to lobby for large national  industries, also participate in UNICE meetings.  Occasionally member  states send their own specialists to participate in certain issues.  For the past six years, UNICE has scrutinized 300 EU directives  adopted for the Single Market, some of which are still under  discussion.  According to the UNICE secretary general, consensus  among the membership is generally arrived at quickly despite their  varying interests.  More difficult is influencing EU decisionmaking.  However, hard work pays off, Graviere notes, and cites the example  of UNICE successfully putting all its weight behind preventing the  adoption of a EU tax on carbonic gas.      To more effectively represent EU companies and to increase its  budget, UNICE established a support committee of some 20 large EU  companies, including IBM Europe, Unilever, Shell, British Petroleum,  Veba, and Iveco.  No large French company is represented since the  large computer company Bull withdrew because of budgetary problems.  Neither are small- and medium-sized companies represented.  They are  represented by default through their national federations.  UNICE  meets with these federations once or twice a year.      Interview With CES Deputy Secretary General Jean Lapeyre      Deputy Secretary General of the European Confederation of Unions  (CES) Jean Lapeyre, who points out that the Maastricht Treaty called  for EU social partners to consult regularly, states that,  unfortunately, dialogue has not intensified between the CES and  UNICE since the treaty's adoption.  He adds that UNICE does not want  to increase social dialogue with unions until the treaty is fully  implemented.  Lapeyre stated that the CES would have liked UNICE,  which agreed approved the text of the treaty, to have taken the  initiative to foster such dialogue, especially on major issues such  as vocational training.  However, Lapeyre criticizes employers for  doing nothing and not being ready for economic crises that may  occur.      While Lapeyre has not given up on UNICE, he argues that only  through social dialogue can the EU take qualitative steps to produce  laws which address general economic problems, a harder task than  confronting objectionable individual company practices.  However,  Lapeyre contends that UNICE has not supported the establishment of  European group committees which would provide a forum for such  social negotiation.  He concludes that only when EU employers become  serious in proposing social dialogue and have a more constructive  attitude will social partners find themselves around a negotiating  table.      EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY      Denis Fainsilber writes on 16 March that the European Space  Agency (ESA), which was established 20 years ago and is noted for  successfully developing the Ariane missile and for having put into  orbit some dozen scientific probes and satellites since 1975, has an  "industrial mission" to fulfill by providing R&amp;D opportunities to  member state aerospace companies.  However, ESA is facing a budget  crisis brought about by Europe's recent economic recession and has  had to put its space ambitions on hold for the next two years as it  tries to find a market niche between the equally tight-budgeted  Russian and U.S. space programs.  ESA must wait to find out its  place in the joint Russia/U.S. Columbia space platform project and  is on "standby" status until the discussions over the project's fate  are concluded, probably late in 1995.  ESA in the meantime is trying  to improve its current operations by obtaining a budget based on  ECU's by 1 January 1997.  The agency points out that each ECU  invested in its contracts generates 3.2 ECU's for EU industries and  that 20 percent of these benefits come directly from ESA's space  sector.  However, ESA member states acknowledge that ESA undertook  too many projects during the late 1980's and that in the future the  agency must reverse this trend.  As a result, the 1994 budget, which  is Fr16.67 billion, is 10 percent lower than 1993, after having  increased each year prior.  It is expected to remain the same for  the next five years.      Guarantee of Industrial Return      According to Winfried Thoma, chief of ESA contracts, the agency's  guarantee to provide "industrial returns" on EU investment in the  agency's projects limits the agency's freedom of action.  While the  agency must find for each program the best cost/benefit industrial  relationship, it must also assure each member state benefits  equivalent to its financial contribution.  When contracts are let  out to bid, ESA cannot allow the free market to work or else the  large manufacturers from France, German, or Italy would consistently  be awarded the agency's contracts, leaving the smaller EU countries  "in the dust."  For the agency to function as an EU institution, it  must encourage competition and allow smaller member states, which  are dependent on EU programs, to share in the work.  For example,  the XXM satellite and the earth stations for the Envisat satellite  were handled this way, according to Fainsilber, who cited sources at  ESA as confirming the program was not controlled by large  industrialists.      However, it is becoming more and more difficult for smaller  companies to compete, Fainsilber claims.  The European space  industry is in the process of restructuring, with five of the  largest companies--Germany's DASA, France's Aerospatiale and  Arianespace, Italy's Matra Marconi Space and SEP--monopolizing 74  percent of the business, compared to 57 percent in 1984.  Fainsilber  cites industry experts as predicting that the consolidation of the  industry will continue because of the current decrease in market  potential.      Another form of ESA's "industrial return" and of subtle balance  among member states is its 2,000 member workforce, which is  recruited in part on criteria of nationality and national financial  contribution.  While ESA's headquarters are in Paris, its research  center, the European Research and Space Technology Center (ESTEC),  is in Noordwijk in The Netherlands.  ESTEC has 1,200 employees and  manages most of ESA's programs.  The rest of the agency is in  Darmstadt, Germany and in Frascat, Italy.      Because of the constraints of balancing these "returns" among  member states, the agency, which manages some 60 programs, has had  trouble completing programs in a timely manner, Fainsilber claims.  The Hermes program, for example, used up enormous sums of money and  time but in the end was never completed and was cancelled.  The  agency has viewed its cancellation as "therapeutic," however, and  has since turned to space programs that are sharply less expensive  for space transport.      ESA Budget Weakness      One of ESA's main weaknesses, according to Fainsilber, is its  budget system, which is the reason for it trying to obtain an ECU-  based budget by 1997.  Critics of the system, "which has poisoned  the life of the organization for years," according to ESA Budget  Chief Jean Vuagnat, question how the agency has held together for 20  years.  The system converts member states' contributions in national  currencies into a unit of account whose conversion rates are  determined when the budget is passed.  The rate is largely  artificial.  Two years later, the Agency retroactively adjusts the  conversion rates with some countries receiving a credit, others a  bill.  In the future, the ESA would like to use the ECU as the basis  of contributions and contract prices, to correct the artificiality  of the current system.  According to Vuagnat, after the EU currency  crises in 1993, there are few real opponents to the change.      (The hard copy version of this Review includes a graph of ESA's  1994 budget, a pie chart on how it is allocated, and a breakdown of  member state financial contributions)      Interview With Marc Giget, Director General of Euroconsult      Euroconsult head Marc Giget contends that ESA has a significant  role to play in relation to U.S. and Russian space programs, as well  as an independent role in space development, and thus will continue  to provide Europe an industrial return.  Giget notes that NASA's  budget is 4.8 times larger that ESA's but claims the difference is  essentially due to the absence of "autonomous access programs" for  flights based in Europe, which are very costly and absorb the  majority of civilian space budgets for the United States and Russia.  In other areas such as satellites, ground observation units, and  missiles, ESA programs are very comparable to its competitors, Giget  claims.  Furthermore, future large infrastructure programs will be  developed with international cooperation, in which ESA will be a  major partner.  Neither NASA, whose budget has been reduced, nor the  Russian RKA, in full budgetary crisis, can alone finance these  projects, which are no longer political priorities.      To compete, Giget concludes that Europe's space industry must  reorganize as did Europe's civilian aircraft industry before merging  into Airbus Industrie.  Fainsilber points out that while NASA's  budget is less than five times that of ESA, it has 25,000 employees  compared to ESA's 2,000.  Nonetheless, he argues, ESA operations are  complex, linked to its role in coordinating space policy for 13  member states whose views are sometimes very different.  While the  EU Commission has criticized ESA for managing this role in a  "pragmatic" way in order to fulfill its mission of providing an  "industrial return" for large and small companies alike, Giget notes  that the Commission also manages its own R&amp;D programs with a  "political return" in mind and with a "systematic salting" of  benefits--a  more perverse system in its dilution of Single Market  goals than ESA's.  In any event, Giget claims there is no European  R&amp;D program that has found a better solution in the current state of   European integration and that if change is desirable, "it is not  necessary to throw the baby out with the bathwater," since ESA is  one of the rare examples of real scientific and technical European  cooperation with a world reputation.      CEDEFOP      Isabelle Graviere's article on 23 March states that the European  Center for Development and Vocational Training (CEDEFOP) promotes  close social welfare coordination among member states, especially in  the domain of vocational education.  To fulfill its mission during  its 20 years of existence, CEDEFOP has developed its research and  information capabilities and coordinated them with European  employers and labor unions for the EU Commission.  In fact, the  Commission is CEDEFOP's primary consumer, ordering research from the  organization and using it for policy decisionmaking.  The center,  explains Ernst Piehl, its director since 1984, is at the source of  numerous Community initiatives, such as the Erasmus European  Exchange Program and the Regional Training and Development Program,  which was launched by CEDEFOP before subsequently becoming the  responsibility of the directorate for regional development and  policy, DG16.      Industry Colloquiums      One of CEDEFOP's greatest contributions to coordinating EU social  welfare policy is that it provides a venue where representatives of  member state governments, the Commission, and EU labor and  employment unions can discuss and negotiate common social policy.  This three-party function is played out at the Administrative  Council three times a year.  Additionally, CEDEFOP organizes  colloquiums, both institutional and industrial, where  representatives can meet.  A colloquium was organized for the retail  industry three years ago, for example, which resulted in  negotiations to coordinate and define European job skill  descriptions.   For 1994, CEDEFOP plans to have colloquiums for the  textile and naval construction industries.  Additionally, CEDEFOP  organizes meetings among Community advocates of various EU programs  such as the continuing education FORCE program or COMETT, which  promotes links between companies and university.  Research and  publications from CEDEFOP's work is distributed freely, such as in  its quarterly bulletin, "CEDEFOP Flash."      Graviere notes that CEDEFOP has been criticized for its  centralized study and research approach to its mission.  A recent  audit of CEDEFOP activity recommended that CEDEFOP "mobilize the  research centers in member states rather than endowing itself with a  heavy research structure at the European level."  However, with its  76-person staff and a budget limited to 12 million ECU's, the Center  is limited.  Moreover, its imminent move to Thessalonica, Greece,  from Berlin will have a "revolutionary" impact on the institution,  according to Graviere, who, however, did not explain further.      Study Visits      Among the activities of CEDEFOP, study visits are one of the most  efficient means of creating industry networks among member states  and diffusing information.  Such visits are intended to provide  training to EU companies in "performance systems" or new ideas, such  as the German apprenticeship system which has been often cited  during the current period of high EU unemployment as a good example  of labor management.  The networks established through these study  visits are crucial to the "real convergence" of European business  methods, Graviere concludes.      Interview With Marie-Odile Paulet, UCC-CFDT Secretary General      Paulet contends that the tripartite nature of CEDEFOP is the  reason the organization works so well.  As the head of a major EU  labor union, Paulet sees CEDEFOP as having allowed the principal  actors in vocational training to exchange ideas and decide policies  together, facilitating the coordination and convergence of European  union.      However, Paulet notes that CEDEFOP has three main weaknesses.  First, the time it takes each of the 12 member states to  sufficiently recognize and understand the needs of vocational  training throughout the Community, a slow but indispensable task to  Europeanize training.  Secondly, CEDEFOP's use of nine languages,  which burdens its work and lengthens the time to publish study  results.  Lastly, the change over the last 20 years which has  required the EU to reposition the organization as the needs for  training and EU institutions have changed.      In Paulet's opinion, CEDEFOP's most exemplary accomplishment is  its documentation of different professional training systems in each  of the 12 member states.  She characterizes such work as  indispensable to European construction and praises CEDEFOP for the  studies it has done on defining professional qualifications, for  providing comparative data on most of the basic occupations within  the EU, and its continuing work on defining job skills for new EU  occupations.  These studies, Paulet claims, have already been used  by labor and employer unions during industry negotiations.      THE DUBLIN FOUNDATION      In the 16 February LES ECHOS, Isabelle Graviere notes that the  Foundation for Improvement of Living and Working Conditions--most  often called the Dublin Foundation--is one of two EU organizations,  the other being CEDEFOP, which allow three-party dialogue on  subjects which concern industry productivity and labor issues.  Each  member state is represented by officials from government, labor, and  management.  Created in 1975 to help the Commission in research, the  Dublin Foundation helps formulate EU policy on issues such as access  to employment, organization of work, health and security,  participation of employees, role of public services, and  environmental protection.  The Foundation conducts polls,  colloquiums, and studies on these issues, analyses the findings, and  publishes the results.  Its conclusions, sometimes accompanied by  recommendations, are provided to the Commission as well as member  state governments, employers, employee organizations, and to the  general public.      Recent, Current Studies      The Foundation's priority is to study the link between better  work conditions and company profitability and then to influence EU  legislation.  Below are examples of past and future Foundation  studies:      * Studied construction worksites to determine the causes of  worksite deaths.  Resulted in a Community directive on construction  worksite safety in 1992.      *  Published a study on workplace stress in 1993.  Has initiated  a study to rethink the traditional organization of companies and to  increase the importance of training and quality of operators.      * Published a "Glossary of Industrial Relations" to compare  industrial terminologies and practices in the different member  states.      *  Will participate in the Community's white paper on employment.  It will study the issues brought up by each member state about their  employment policies.      * In 1994 the Dublin Foundation will conduct the second EU study  on the work environment to verify improvements or degradations in  work conditions in the EU.      *  Additional studies frequently requested by companies include  problems with unskilled labor, lack of appropriate equipment,  occupational rigidities, noise and air pollution, and night work.      Interview With Jacques Combe, CNPF Representative      Combe, who represents France's Confederation of French Employers  (CNPF) at the Dublin Foundation, points out that the Foundation's  difficulty in translating its findings into concrete actions in the  workplace is its major weakness.  Moreover, he notes that it is  difficult for it even to formulate recommendations if they will in  any way constrain member states.  Combe claims this weakness is  because the Foundation is not well known.  Unlike agencies created  to oversee the coordination of Community regulations, such as the  Patent Office, the Dublin Foundation is an "upstream" organization  whose task is to define what exists and to determine what is needed  in the EU workplace.      EURO STAT      Eurostat has seen its functions expand greatly over the last few  years in response to the increased pace of European union, evolving  from an in-house body concerned with gathering data on EU policies  to the Community's premiere statistical watchdog which supplies  companies and governments with all EU statistics, not only those  linked closely to EC policies.  It's priority, according to Isabelle  Graviere writing in the 9 February edition of LES ECHOS, is to  furnish its consumers with all statistical information useful to  analyze and make decisions.  A "satellite" General Directorate under  the Commission, Eurostat has developed its analytical tools over the  last few years to include Community industrial activity.  It has  reformed its methods, increased its investment in people, and  expanded its cooperation with professional organizations.  It will  soon add new fields to its repertoire, including providing  statistics for service industries, construction and public works,  and small businesses.      Eurostat, located in Luxembourg, has six departments, five of  which are "operational" and are organized around economic activity  sectors: economic and monetary convergence, foreign and inter-  Community trade, companies and energy, social and regional  statistics, and agriculture, fishing, and the environment.  Eurostat  coordinates and cooperates with other Commission directorates,  Community organizations, and with EU companies and professional  organizations to determine their statistical needs.  It holds an  annual meeting with the 12 representatives of national statistical  organizations to coordinate policy and it is developing a dialogue  for this purpose with EU companies.      Expansion has brought some problems to Eurostat.  It has gone  from 12 to 18 members, including those countries in the European  Economic Area, and is developing an interest in East Europe.  This  geographic enlargement, according to Yves Franchet, Eurostat  director since 1987, has raised the question as to whether Eurostat  should be more independent as well as whether it should do more to  apply the principle of subsidiarity, contracting work to national  organizations.      Some economic sectors remain less covered than others.  Manufacturing (where a majority of large companies are concentrated  which are easiest to gather data on) has seen real progress,  Graviere writes.  This is not the case with services, construction  and public works, and small businesses.  However, when the Community  adopts the Special Nomenclature of Activities of the European  Communities (NACE) and establishes company catalogs which contain  polling information, Eurostat will then be able to increase its  reporting in these sectors.      Interview With Yvonick Renard, CNPF Statistical Study Group Head      Renard remarked that, unfortunately, little of the data from  Eurostat is usable in industrial matters, principally for reasons of  detail and timeliness.  While the economic polls Eurostat conducts  with company panels for the Economic and Financial Affairs  Directorate, DGII, are certainly useful, Renard points out that they  lack a common statistical reference base and therefore lose a large  part of their viability.     Renard notes that Eurostat underwent a "quiet revolution" when it  changed the EU's official list of products and businesses to comply  with consolidated customs offices' lists, or Intrastat lists, in  January 1993.  This change has affected the statistical management  of companies, Renard claims.  It allowed economic information to be  much more comparable than in the past.  However, the operational use  of these Intrastat lists is weak and needs to be quickly improved in  such areas as orders, investments, cost of production, and cost of  employment.      Equally positive, according to Renard, is the increased  cooperation among EU statistical organizations and EU professional  organizations.  The latter, both on the EU and the national levels,  constitutes a very dense network of industrial data.  Within the  framework of the DEBA group, established to promote cooperation  among EU professional organizations, this data is synthesized in up-  to-date economic studies and reports on the Single Market and shared  with the public.      Renard concludes that the importance of viable Community data for  all the member states was evident when the Maastricht Treaty was  negotiated.  However, the data should not be at the exclusive use of  the Community and its dialogue with professional groups should be  increased, he argues.  Technically, coordinating statistics  throughout the Community remains difficult as witnessed in the  reticence of certain member states to establish a common  classification of company activities.      Eurostat Publication      Eurostat publications are listed in "Catalogue Eurostat -  Publications and Electronic Services" under nine principal themes.  Below are six of the themes most relevant to businesses:      General Statistics:  The most popular in this group is "Europe in  Numbers" and "Basis Community Statistics," in which data is compared  to Europe's major economic partners.      Economy and Finance: Eurostat publishes country statistics, such  as on the Russian economy, and sector analyses, such as on consumer  prices in the EU.      Population and Social Conditions: Consists of statistical data on  unemployment.      Energy and Industry: These publications have the largest  audience, especially the one entitled "Panorama of Community  Industry," which is published every two months in coordination with  the DG3.      Foreign Trade and Balance of Payments: Consists of a monthly  publication.      Services and Transportation: Among its works is "Retail Trade in  the Single Market in 1993."

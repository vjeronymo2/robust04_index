			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Warhorses relive heroic defeats - Ivo Dawnay listens to the old music of boos and jeers FOR just a few minutes, the Labour conference turned into its old self yesterday. And inevitably, it was the platform veterans - Mr Arthur Scargill, NUM president, and Mr Dennis Skinner, MP for Bolsover - who brought the floor to its feet. With rip-roaring 'I-told-you-so' speeches on the relentless decline of the coal industry, the two warhorses invoked the spirit of the miners' strike and other heroic defeats. To top it off, there even followed a spat with the rightwing engineers, accompanied by the magical music of boos and jeers that, in the good old, bad old days, alerted the most somnolent reporters to the prospect of a front-page story. But, as has characterised this listless week in Blackpool, there was no real story, merely a bit of blowing off steam. 'What you saw there was a nostalgic look back at the past,' said Mr Alistair Darling, the new City spokesman on Labour's modernist wing. Labour's new conformism and the steely grip with which the new party leadership has established its authority has been the true and unspectacular story of the week. There have been a few fleeting gestures of resistance. Yesterday delegates arrived to find the union barons had fired a warning shot on reform of their block vote by passing a motion, all but ruling out any serious change to the party-union relationship. 'There is some unfinished business there,' Mr Stuart Bell, the Middlesbrough MP and another moderniser, remarked. Yet, elsewhere, there were some clues to the readiness of the party's newly emollient supreme authority to roll over and play the leadership's game. Another motion, calling for the maintenance of Clause IV - the highly totemic commitment to public ownership - was, largely unnoticed, voted down by 4.3m discredited block votes to 1.2m. Similarly discreetly, Blackpool '92 also voted for the conference's own emasculation. In consequence, a new mechanism for policymaking - dominated by the national executive committee and shadow cabinet under Mr John Smith's leadership - will reduce its future powers only to those of veto. Furthermore, Mr Smith - previously viewed as uninterested in party management - has demonstrated that the pace of a well-upholstered tortoise might well prove more effective than the hyperactive style of a Kinnock hare. That, together with the plight of the government, is Labour's good news. But the principal question mark that has dominated the past four days centres on whether Labour has done anything this week to alter an image as outdated and as unrepresentative of modern Britain as the redbrick seaside resort of Blackpool itself. Under a platform like something out of the Festival of Britain, Mr Smith's speech promoted the stolid values of the 1950s - moral, austere, pragmatic - but proved entirely devoid of signposts as to which way the party has to go. Long-time conference-goers have remarked that this year it has been flatter and duller than any they can remember. There has been no real debate of the causes that lay behind the April election defeat, or on how they should be addressed. Introspective, but shallowly so, Labour appears more and more like the Church of England - ready to change just enough to irritate some of the older traditionalists, but not sufficiently to win any new converts. Even new bloods like Mr Blair have felt obliged to recite the liturgy, while Mr Brown paid lip service with an unexplained and unconvincing promise to tackle the foreign exchange speculators. Not one frontbench spokesman addressed head-on how the individualist, not to say greedy, south of the country is to be persuaded to mend its ways. Or, alternatively, how Labour will mend its own. That, we are promised, will come next year. It is unfortunate, nonetheless, for the 'modernisers' that Scargill and Skinner proved the show's best double act.</p>

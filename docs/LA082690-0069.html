			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USING THE U.N. TO SETTLE MIDEAST CRISIS  </P> <P> Few men boasted as impressive a resume upon running for the presidency as  President Bush. Nevertheless, this consummate politician may have misjudged how  his playing golf and fishing will be perceived by the American people while  thousands of our military prepare for conflict in the Middle East.  </P> <P> President Carter was seen as a virtual prisoner during the hostage taking late  in his Administration. President Bush, apprehensive of a similar fate as that  of Presient Carter, overreacted by appearing nonchalantly in front of the media  on the first tee, determined not to be imprisoned in the Oval Office.  </P> <P> However, by this misplaced conduct the President opened himself to criticism  from two camps -- either as a dedicated sportsman, to the detriment of his  constitutional duties, or a politician too concerned with his image and the  upcoming 1992 election season.  </P> <P> JEFFERY LA GOY  </P> <P> La Crescenta  </P></p>

			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / International Company News: Profits fall at Exxon, Mobil and Chevron THE RECESSION'S impact on oil companies was reflected in the fourth-quarter results of Exxon, Mobil and Chevron, which all reported sharply lower earnings for the period. Very strong oil prices a year earlier, following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, made earnings comparisons particularly difficult for the three months. Exxon, the world's biggest oil company, unveiled a 28 per cent drop in fourth-quarter earnings but posted a 12 per cent improvement in net income for the year. The company blamed the erosion in fourth-quarter earnings on exceptionally high prices in the corresponding 1990 quarter after the invasion of Kuwait. The decline also reflects weak gas prices in the US and lower production of liquids and natural gas. In the latest quarter, Exxon earned Dollars 1.12bn or 89 cents a share against Dollars 1.56bn or Dollars 1.23 a year earlier. Revenues fell 12 per cent to Dollars 30.87bn from Dollars 35.12bn. Exxon's full-year net income climbed to Dollars 5.6bn or Dollars 4.45 a share from Dollars 5.01bn or Dollars 3.96. Revenues were flat, at Dollars 116.34bn compared with Dollars 116.94bn a year ago. Mr Lawrence Rawl, chairman, said all the company's earnings growth in the year and 75 per cent of its profits had come from overseas. 'The company's foreign refining and marketing operations were well-positioned to respond to rapidly changing market conditions, particularly in the first quarter when essentially all of this year's increase in earnings was achieved.' During the year, crude oil prices fell by Dollars 10-a-barrel, cutting into Exxon's profits. Earnings were also hit by sluggish natural gas prices in the US and weak markets for chemicals, coal and copper. Mobil, the second biggest US oil and gas group, posted fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 401m or 97 cents a share, down 38 per cent from 1990's Dollars 652m or Dollars 1.58 a share. Stripping out one-time items, fourth-quarter operating earnings were Dollars 389m, down 51 per cent from Dollars 797m last year. Mobil's fourth-quarter revenues fell 24 per cent to Dollars 16.63bn from Dollars 19.38bn. Full-year revenues edged 3 per cent lower to Dollars 62.68bn from Dollars 64.47bn. For the year, Mobil earned Dollars 1.92bn or Dollars 4.65 a share against Dollars 1.93bn or Dollars 4.60. Excluding extraordinary items, earnings for 1991 were Dollars 1.90bn against Dollars 1.92bn last year. Mr Allen Murray, chairman, said Mobil's operating performance helped offset some of the negative factors in 1991. Chevron, the fourth biggest US oil company, turned in fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 39m or 11 cents a share, including extraordinary items of Dollars 244m. A year earlier, Chevron earned Dollars 633m or Dollars 1.80 a share, including one-time charges of Dollars 123m. For the year, Chevron's earnings fell 40 per cent to Dollars 1.29bn or Dollars 3.69 a share from Dollars 2.16bn or Dollars 6.10 in 1990 in spite of strong gains from the company's foreign operations. Chevron attributed the decline to depressed natural gas prices and downstream margins in the US. Chevron had fourth-quarter revenues of Dollars 10.39bn, down from Dollars 13.76bn. Total 1991 revenues were Dollars 40.95bn from Dollars 42.57bn. Mr Michael Young, an analyst at Smith Barney, said the results met his expectations and provided further evidence that the industry would have a very weak first quarter. 'Clearly oil companies are at the depths of a recessionary cycle in all of the major segments,' namely chemicals, US and foreign oil and gas, and US and foreign refining and marketing. These sentiments were echoed by Mr Murray who said: 'Unfortunately, 1992 is not off to a good start. There has been no improvement in business conditions. Crude oil prices have remained weak, as have US natural gas prices which are below last year's level, and US downstream margins are very weak.' Mr Young said he had not changed his earnings estimates for Mobil, Exxon or Chevron. He expects Mobil to earn 80 cents a share in the 1992 first quarter, and Dollars 4.15 a share for the full year. He expects Exxon to earn 85 cents in the first quarter and Dollars 3.90 for the year and Chevron 60 cents in the quarter and Dollars 3.80 in the year. Imperial Oil, 70 per cent owned by Exxon, and Canada's biggest integrated oil company, is following Petro-Canada and Shell Canada with heavy cuts in downstream operations, Robert Gibbens reports from Montreal. Imperial posted a 1991 operating loss of CDollars 36m (USDollars 31m) on revenues of CDollars 9.2bn against profits of CDollars 522m on revenues of CDollars 11.3bn in 1990. But after gains on asset sales and accounting adjustments, net profits were CDollars 162m or 84 cents a share against CDollars 256m or CDollars 1.34 a share. Imperial will probably close two small refineries and several hundred retail petrol outlets. Staff will be cut from the present 11,500. Details will be released next month.</p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / The Markets: Lead and zinc group meets - Commodities Leaders of the world's lead and zinc industries, who have been meeting in Vienna over the weekend, today begin the 39th full session of the International Lead and Zinc Study Group. The session, which continues tomorrow, follows committee meetings among the 300 government and industry participants. Many will have been continuing debates begun at last week's London Metals Week on the influence on metal markets of the influx over the past two years of money from international investment funds, which have come to regard commodities as a long-term asset to be traded as alternatives to traditional securities such as equities and bonds. The distortions this has entailed will be a factor when the study group considers demand and prices for the two sister metals. A report published last week by Billiton Metals said both metals were 'poised to derive significant benefits from the period of synchronised growth emerging in the major industrialised economies'. 'On the production side,' it said, 'mine cutbacks have resulted in substantial shortfalls of concentrate (an intermediate material). In 1993 contained zinc output fell by some 450,000 tonnes (8 per cent), while that of lead declined by 300,000 tonnes (13 per cent). Further reductions will be experienced this year, although restarts and new additions to zinc capacity are already starting to reverse this situation. These will have little impact on lead concentrate output, and a further deficit seems likely this year.' Other events this week include the 1st International Conference on Mining Environmental Management in Reno Nevada, which began yesterday and continues until Wednesday. The conference, sponsored by Mining Journal and Mining World News, will focus on mining-oriented environmental legislation, the financial implications, the available technological solutions and management control systems.</p>

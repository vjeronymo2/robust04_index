			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [SEGODNYA report: "Duma Budget Committee Against Upping </F> State Spending"]    [Text] The State Duma Budget Committee does not think it  possible to hike budget expenditures in line with  recommendations passed by the senate. Committee Chairman  Mikhail Zadornov thinks the budget calls for serious correction,  but it should be accepted precisely in the shape submitted by  the government. He pointed out that the main indicators of the  level of expenditures, revenues, as well as the budget deficit  were already approved in the first reading and cannot be  changed, whereas an item-by-item redistribution of expenditures  is not ruled out.</p>

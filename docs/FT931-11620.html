			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Plasterboard prices about to rise PRICES of plasterboard widely used in construction and home improvements are about to rise for the second time in eight months. The move is likely to increase builders' fears of further increases for materials as the economy recovers. Contractors that have taken jobs at fixed prices simply to cover overheads could face damaging losses if the cost of materials rose during the work. British Steel and Pilkington, which supply large amounts of steel and glass for construction, have announced price increases in the past three weeks. Prices of some imported timber used in construction have also risen after sterling's devaluation. BPB Industries, Europe's biggest plasterboard producer, has told customers it will raise the prices of some products by more than 10 per cent from the beginning of next month. Last summer the company increased prices by an average of about 15 per cent. The move followed the ending of a bitter European price war between the three largest manufacturers: BPB, Lafarge Coppee of France and Knauf of Germany. Plasterboard prices in France have risen by about a quarter and in Germany by about 15 per cent since the beginning of last year. The increases prompted allegations by builders, rejected by the Office of Fair Trading, that the three companies had colluded over pricing. Mr John Maxwell, BPB's chief executive, said the company was justified in trying to recover a small part of its lost margins. He said: 'UK plasterboard prices fell by more than half in real terms between 1987 and 1992.' Lafarge and Knauf, which with BPB supply almost all the plasterboard in the UK, are also expected to raise their prices again following BPB's latest lead. Contractors said they will try to resist price increases announced by Pilkington and British Steel by turning to overseas suppliers if necessary. Mr Allan Collins, president of the British Constructional Steelwork Association, said he believed the increases would stick. He said British Steel was prepared to supply smaller consignments, cut to the finer tolerances that customers required and competitors found difficult to match. Prices to constructional steel suppliers are due to rise by 7 per cent to 13 per cent from the end of this month.</p>

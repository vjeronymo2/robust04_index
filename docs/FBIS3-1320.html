"Up until  yesterday, all we learned was that there was unusual movement of  Cameroonian troops toward the Nigerian border," General Fred  Chijuka, spokesman of the Defense Headquarters, told AFP. Gen.  Chijuka, however, remarked that the movement of the Cameroonian  troops does not necessarily mean that they have come "into  contact" with Nigerian troops. "They are probably moving their  troops closer to the border just in case hostilities break out,"  he said. Nigeria and Cameroon, which are claiming ownership of  the Bakassi Peninsula, a 1,000-square-km zone rich in fish and  oil, have stationed their troops at their borders.</p>

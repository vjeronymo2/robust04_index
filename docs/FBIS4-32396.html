			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, June 23 (CTK) -- Over half of the Czech  press is either owned or part-controlled by foreign concerns,  the Czech daily DENNI TELEGRAF reports today.    The Swiss concern Ringier owns a Czech-based joint stock  company of the same name which publishes the best-selling  newspaper in the Czech Republic, the tabloid BLESK. Besides  this it has a 51 percent stake in the daily LIDOVE NOVINY and  the regional paper MORAVSKOSLEZSKY DEN. Among other media  publications controlled by Ringier are the weekly RESPEKT,  PRAGUE NEWS, TENIS REVUE, CESKOMORAVSKY PROFIT and TYDENIK  TELEVIZE.    MLADA FRONTA DNES, the serious Czech daily with the widest  circulation, is published by MaFra in which the French company  Socpresse -- publishers of the French newspaper LE MONDE -- has  a 48 percent stake. Socpresse additionally has stakes in five  regional newspapers.    Most of the regional papers in the Czech Republic are  controlled, however, by the Bavarian concern Passauer Neue  Presse which, according to the DENNI TELEGRAF article, owns many  Bavarian regional dailies which are close to the conservative  CSU party. Passauer Neue Presse has a large stake in the Czech  holding company Vltava Labe Press which publishes papers such as  JIHOCESKE LISTY, SEVEROCESKE NOVINY, HRADECKE NOVINY, as well as  the national magazines MLADY SVET and KVETY.    The agricultural daily ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY is 65 percent owned  by the German Mittelrhein Verlag Bohemia, which also controls 86  percent of the tabloid EXPRES.    A number of specialist economic publications are controlled  by a concern called Euroexpanzion, created by Germany's  Handelsblatt and the American Dow Jones company (which publishes  THE WALL STREET JOURNAL). Euroexpanzion owns 45 percent of  Economica, the company which publishes the Czech economic daily  HOSPODARSKE NOVINY, and the periodicals EKONOM and FINANCE.    Among Czech publications in which no foreign capital is  involved are RUDE PRAVO, a left-leaning daily in which the  editor-in-chief has the majority share, the right-leaning daily  CESKY DENIK, DENNI TELEGRAF, which is owned by Investicni a  Postovni Banka [Investment and Postal Bank] and PRACE, in which  the trade unions have the majority share. The daily SVOBODNE  SLOVO is published by the Melantrich publishing company, 97  percent of shares in which belong to the Liberal National Social  Party (LSNS). But the new law on political parties will oblige  the LSNS to renounce its share and the daily will most likely be  taken over by private individuals, DENNI TELEGRAF writes.</p>

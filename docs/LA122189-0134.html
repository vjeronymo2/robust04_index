			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMBAT IN PANAMA;  </P> <P> NORIEGA'S U.N. AMBASSADOR APPEALS FOR TRUCE  </P> <P> Gen. Manuel A. Noriega's ambassador to the United Nations on Wednesday urged  the world body's Security Council to appeal to President Bush for a cease-fire  in Panama.  </P> <P> Ambassador Mirla Bellavita also asked the council to send international  observers to monitor a withdrawal of U.S. troops from her nation.  </P> <P> Bellavita earlier outlined the pro-Noriega strategy at a closed-door meeting of  nearly 100 nonaligned members of the world body. The Security Council held an  evening meeting on the Panama fighting.  </P> <P> The ambassador contended that Noriega "still was in Panama, moving around for  security reasons" but maintaining contact with members of the Panama Defense  Forces.  </P> <P> After hearing Bellavita and Nicaraguan Ambassador Alejandro Serrano Caldera,  the nonaligned group adopted a declaration denouncing "this unacceptable act of  intervention" and affirming its "solidarity with the Panamanian people." The  statement also called on the United States to "cease immediately all military  operations in Panama and to solve outstanding issues with that country through  dialogue and negotiations."  </P> <P> Nicaragua, which requested the Security Council session and which was to be the  only non-member of the council to speak Wednesday, circulated a draft  resolution that would condemn the invasion as a "flagrant violation of  international law." It also would demand "immediate cessation of the invasion  and withdrawal of troops."  </P> <P> The United States has veto power over any Security Council actions. Chinese  Ambassador Li Luye said, after emerging from informal consultations, that "most  of the delegates want to have an immediate meeting." But he added that "one or  two wanted more time."  </P> <P> U.S. strategy was to adopt a waiting stance as the search for Noriega went on  and as more than 24,000 troops moved to crush Noriega's forces and consolidate  the position of Guillermo Endara, the U.S.-backed president.  </P> <P> The conflict in Panama was mirrored at the United Nations when delegates loyal  to Noriega vowed to remain as Panama's official voice.  </P> <P> But the Endara administration sent its own U.N. ambassador, Harvard University  scholar Eduardo Vallarino, who remained in a nearby hotel while Noriega  supporters retained possession of their plush offices just north of the U.N.  headquarters. The Noriega diplomats entered their mission at 6 a.m. Wednesday  and instructed building staff members to bar visitors.  </P> <P> U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering told reporters that the council had agreed  not to hear either of the Panamanian factions. Panama is not a council member.  </P> <P> Throughout the day Wednesday, an atmosphere of crisis gripped the world body.  Members of the Security Council met in informal deliberations as consensus  built for the formal session.  </P></p>

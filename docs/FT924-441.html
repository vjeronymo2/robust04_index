			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Four to be charged with breaking UN sanctions against Serbia, Montenegro A Greek shipowner and three captains are to be charged with breaking United Nations sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, following an investigation by the prosecutor's office in Piraeus port, writes Kerin Hope in Athens. The shipowner, Mr Theodoros Therapiotis, is accused of ordering three of his vessels to unload banned cargoes at ports in Montenegro in October and early November. The investigation was launched last month after the UN sanctions committee in New York informed the Greek government that one of the ships, the Theta Triton, was suspected of breaking the embargo.</p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Portmeirion Potteries advances 40% AFTER AN upsurge in the first half Portmeirion Potteries is expecting a satisfactory result for 1992, although a return to the 1990 pre-tax profit level of Pounds 3.4m is unlikely. In the six months ended June 30 pre-tax profit came to Pounds 1.42m, an advance of 40.5 per cent over the depressed Pounds 1.01m. That was affected by short time working and reorganisation costs, but at the end of 1991 the profit had reached Pounds 2.61m. Turnover rose 18.5 per cent to Pounds 10.4m. Earnings per share worked through at 8.89p (6.47p) and the interim dividend is again 2.25p.</p>

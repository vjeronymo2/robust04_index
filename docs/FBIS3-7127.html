			<p>Language: <F P=105> Burmese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Rangoon Burma Television Network in  Burmese at 1330 GMT on 24 March carries a 50-minute report on  the 24 March plenary session of the National Convention to draw  up the basic principles for drafting the new constitution held  in the Central Meeting Hall of the President's Residence  compound on Ahlone Road in Rangoon. The report includes  extracts of the proposal papers read by 13 delegates at this  morning's session on the three chapter headings on the state,  state structure, and head of state.    The proposal paper prepared by the group representing  peasants was read by U Shwe Hla and U Kyaw Aye. U Shwe Hla of  Rakhine State proposes that a basic principle be prescribed to  declare Rangoon the state capital and a "Union territory under  the direct administration of the president" due to its unique  position as the seat of government and its importance for the  country's defense and security, economy, and international  communications. He also suggests that "other areas with unique  conditions, such as the Coco Islands, be declared Union  territory under the direct administration of the president."    Next, U Kyaw Aye of Karen State continues reading the report  dealing with qualifications for president -- loyalty, genuine  citizen born of parents who are citizens, appropriate age -- and  the election of president through the electoral college composed  of all members of Parliament who will be separated into three  groups. The three groups are: "The first group is composed of  members of the chamber of Parliament who are elected based on  equal representation from states and divisions; the second group  is composed of members of the chamber of Parliament based on  population; the third group is composed of members of Defense  Services nominated by the commander in chief of the Defense  Services to the two chambers of Parliament."    Next, the proposal paper prepared by the group representing  workers is read by U Kyaw Win Tun of Mandalay Division,  explaining the need to include perpetuation of existing national  territory as a basic principle in the constitution. U Kyi Myint  of Pegu Division continues reading the workers group report  dealing with the state structure and prescription of  self-administrative divisions and self-administrative zones.    U Aung San of Magwe division continues reading the workers  group report suggesting the president be elected by the  electoral college composed of three groups of members of  Parliament.    Next, U Sam Lut Naw of Kachin State repesenting the workers  group read his paper. Addressing the issue of whether the  Convention delegates can determine which national groups are  entitled to self- administered zones or self-administered  divisions and in which states and divisions, U Sam Lut Naw says  this matter cannot be determined by the delegates. He says "the  basic principle unanimously endorsed by the delegates calls for  prescription of self-adminsitered areas for national groups if  they have an appropriate number of population living  collectively in a congruous territory. It says based on the  size of population and extent of the territory, the status of  self-administered divisons or self-administered zones are to be  granted as appropriate." He says, however, the delegates do not  have at their disposal data on the size of population and  territory to determine the self-adminstration status. He says:  "The delegates do not know what constitutes an appropriate  population size, and they cannot decide on the matter.  Furthermore, he says the delegates do not know which national  groups have asked for status of self-administered division or  zone. He says the delegates do not know which national groups,  out of 135 national groups, want self-administered divisions or  zones. As for the requirement for living collectively in a  congruous territory, the delegates have no knowledge. The  delegates also have no knowledge of geographical location and  dimension. Therefore, I believe the status of self-administered  division or zone can be determined only after the knowledge is  obtained on the aforementioned two unknown points. [applause].  Therefore, I propose that it is only appropriate for the state  to form a commission to decide on the issue of self-administered  areas."    Continuing, U Sam Lut Naw, worker representative of the  Kachin State, addresses the issue of election of president. He  says: "Even major countries in the world only have one president  and one vice president. The population and territory of the  Union of Myanmar [Burma] are not big. Therefore, there should  not be two vice presidents but one president and one vice  president. [applause] Also, there should be only two groups in  the Electoral College without a group composed of members of  Defense Services nominated by the commander in chief of the  Defense Services to the two chambers of Parliament. The two  vice presidents should be elected by two groups of the Electoral  College composed of members of two chambers of Parliament.  [number as heard] [applause] Members of Parliament from the  Defense Services nominated by the commander in chief of the  Defense Services are already included in the two chambers of  Parliament."    In the recorded portions of delegates speeches carried on 23  and 24 March, U Sam Lut Naw is the only delegate to have  received applause for his speech. In this session, the  recording of his speech was interrupted by applause four times.    Next, U Min Naing, an artist, reads the report of the group  representing intelligentsia and intellectuals. The report  suggests the additional principle -- that "the state is a state  where indigenous fraternal national people live in unity through  weal and woe" and the term "Myanmar" refers to all national  groups residing in the state -- be added to the already accepted  four principles concerning sovereignty, government, territory,  and population. The report also suggests that a national group,  regardless of whether or not they obtain the self-administered  status, should have the right to participate in their regional  affairs and to freely preserve the language, literature,  culture, customs, and traditions they cherish according to the  law. The report also calls for prevention of exploitation of  one race by another.    Continuing the report, Henzada U Myint Wai proposes that  three groups of the Electoral College elect the country's  president and two vice presidents. The report also proposes  that the president be elected in the last month of the third  quarter of the fiscal year to give sufficient time to the  president to attend to financial matters.    Next, the report prepared by the group representing public  servants is read by U Maung Maung of the Ministry of Hotel and  Tourist Industry. The report proposes to include the provision:  "Myanmar is a sovereign and independent state" in the chapter on  the state in order safeguard and uphold national sovereignty and  independence.    Continuing the report, U Yan Naing Aung of the Ministry of  Agriculture, proposes that areas of strategic, economic, and  administrative importance be declared as "Union territories  under the direct administration of president." Addressing the  issue of granting self-administered areas, U Yan Naing Aung  expresses the view "that it is not appropriate for a national  group, which already has the status of region or state, to  demand the status of self- administered division or  self-administered zone in another region or state." He says  similarly, if a national group has been granted a  self-adminstered zone or self-administered division in a state  or division, it is not appropriate to grant self-administered  zone or self-administered division status to the same national  group in another state or region.    Next, Dr. Kyaw Win of the Ministry of Health continues  reading the report of the public servants. The report proposes  the corollary to "the basic principle that the president must be  loyal to the nation and its citizens, the president or one of  his parents, or his spouse, or any of his legal children, or  spouse of any of his legal children shall not owe allegiance to  a foreign power or serve a foreign power and shall not be a  citizen of a foreign country." The report also proposes that the  president be well versed in the national affairs to have correct  judgement and effective leadership. The report also proposes  that the president meet the residency requirements of at least  20 years in the country.    Lieutenant Colonel Tin Kha of the Defense Ministry continues  with the report of the public servants. The report deals with  the 37 basic principles proposed by the group dealing with  citizenship, term of office of the president, requirement for  president and vice president to resign from a social or  religious organization from the date of his election, and  qualifications for president and vice president. The report  says the group representing public servants gives priority to  emergence of a modern and developed state.    The plenary session ends at 1605 after the submission of the  reports.</p>

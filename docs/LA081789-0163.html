			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP REVIEW;  </P> <P> ELTON JOHN AT THE FORUM: A MAN WITHOUT A GIMMICK  </P> <P> From the thunderous audience response during Elton John's show at the Forum on  Tuesday, you'd think that the veteran pop star hadn't performed in Los Angeles  in a decade.  </P> <P> Actually, John sold out three shows at the Hollywood Bowl less than 11 months  ago.  </P> <P> Then he must be riding a big comeback hit?  </P> <P> No. John's coming album, "Sleeping With the Past," won't be released until the  end of the month. And his last album, "Reg Strikes Back," didn't exactly set  the the pop world on fire.  </P> <P> Then, surely, he must have decided to reintroduce the outrageous costumes and  flamboyant stage presence that he put in mothballs a couple of years ago.  </P> <P> Wrong again. John hardly moved from his electric piano, and he wore just two  suits during the entire show -- granted, one was lavender and the other was  lime green.  </P> <P> So what accounted for the frequently tumultuous response?  </P> <P> The songs.  </P> <P> John's 2 1/2-hour show drew its strength almost completely from the quality and  diversity of his music.  </P> <P> For most acts, pacing a show means simply alternating ballads and up-tempo  songs. But John's remarkably diverse repertoire allowed him to move from the  spacey funk of "Bennie and the Jets" to the classically shaded elegance of  "Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word"; from the feel-good pop of "Philadelphia  Freedom" to the swaggering, rave-up rock of "The Bitch Is Back" -- which was  made even hotter Tuesday with the inclusion of several bars of the Rolling  Stones' "Brown Sugar."  </P> <P> John also struck just the right balance between engaging but disposable ear  candy like last year's "I Don't Wanna Go on With You Like That" and more  challenging, ambitious works like the symphonic rock piece "Funeral for a  Friend/Love Lies Bleeding."  </P> <P> The 42-year-old singer/songwriter focused on crowd-pleasing oldies in the first  hour. Nine of the first 12 songs dated from 1976 or before. The night's biggest  ovation was for the graceful ballad "Candle in the Wind," which John introduced  16 years ago. The mere mention, early in the show, of the 1973 album "Goodbye  Yellow Brick Road" got a big hand.  </P> <P> But this was no idle stroll down memory lane. John and his five-man backup band  pumped up the arrangements of several of the songs and thoroughly revamped two  of them. His bluesy funk version of the 1972 pop hit "Rocket Man" bore little  resemblance to the original. And John has turned his sing-songy 1984 hit "Sad  Songs (Say So Much)" into a muscular, gospel-flavored rocker.  </P> <P> And the balance shifted to newer material in the second hour. There were no  songs at all in the show from the years 1977-81, when John was in a commercial  and artistic slump.  </P> <P> John told the audience that his coming album was inspired by R&amp;B songs that  he and longtime collaborator Bernie Taupin enjoyed when they were growing up.  </P> <P> You'd never know it, however, from the four songs he previewed Tuesday. The  album's first single, "Healing Hands," is a crafty mix of pop and rock  elements, but the title song is far too pat and polite. John never came close  to cutting loose, much less working up a sweat. What kind of R&amp;B is that?  </P> <P> It once seemed that the secret to John's success as a concert performer was his  over-the-top showmanship, which made him the Liberace of rock.  </P> <P> There must have been times over the years when John worried that if he ever put  aside the costumes and the props and the antics, fans would gradually lose  interest. Perhaps, he must have feared, it was the outrageousness and the high  jinks that intrigued them.  </P> <P> That's why the strong response Tuesday must have been especially gratifying.  When a visibly moved John told the audience, "You've touched me very deeply  tonight and I thank you," one could almost see those old fears evaporate.  </P> <P> When John then launched into the proud, chest-thumping "I'm Still Standing," it  was no idle boast.  </P> <P> John's sold-out, three-night Forum stand is set to conclude Friday. He's slated  to play the Pacific Amphitheatre on Saturday.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANDELA URGES TALKS TO PLAN FOR 'A NEW ERA';  </P> <P> SOUTH AFRICA: THE JAILED BLACK LEADER STILL BACKS ARMED STRUGGLE. BUT HE  STRESSES NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT.  </P> <P> Jailed black nationalist Nelson R. Mandela, in his first major policy statement  since his trial 26 years ago, has reiterated his commitment to the armed  liberation struggle "as a legitimate form of self-defense," but he says he  wants to bring the African National Congress and the white minority-led  government to the negotiating table.  </P> <P> The lengthy document, published Thursday by the left-wing Cape Town weekly  South, offers rare insight into the thinking of Mandela, the 71-year-old leader  of the ANC.  </P> <P> Sources close to Mandela say the document was written last year, presented to  Pieter W. Botha, who was then the president of South Africa, at their meeting  in July and later read to anti-apartheid leaders who visited Mandela in prison.  </P> <P> "The overwhelming majority of South Africans, black and white, hope to see the  ANC and the government working closely together to lay the foundations for a  new era in our country, in which racial discrimination and prejudice, coercion  and confrontation, death and destruction, will be forgotten," Mandela says,  according to the text published in South. He urges the government to seize the  opportunity without delay.  </P> <P> Mandela has since written another, secret peace proposal for his colleagues in  the outlawed ANC. This proposal, described as a 10-point peace plan, is under  consideration by the ANC's national executive at its exile headquarters in  Lusaka, Zambia.  </P> <P> Mandela is expected to be released within weeks from Victor Verster Prison,  where he is serving a life sentence for sabotage. Justice Minister Kobie  Coetsee, in an interview this week, said the government intends to free Mandela  and that the only question is "when and under what circumstances."  </P> <P> In a separate development Thursday, anti-apartheid leaders made public a letter  from Mandela in which he said the ANC remains committed to nationalizing banks,  mines and monopoly industries. Any change in that policy is inconceivable,  Mandela said.  </P> <P> The letter was published by leaders of the United Democratic Front, an  anti-apartheid coalition with close ties to the ANC. Front spokesman Patrick  Lekota said Mandela wanted to clarify his position on economic issues because  of suggestions that he and the external ANC leadership are in conflict.  </P> <P> "Black economic empowerment is a goal we fully support and encourage, but in  our situation state control of certain sectors of the economy is unavoidable,"  Mandela said in the letter.  </P> <P> In the policy statement published by South, Mandela said he was "acting on my  own initiative, in the hope that the (ANC) will, in due course, endorse my  action."  </P> <P> He stressed that his decision to urge the government to negotiate with the ANC  was not an attempt at negotiation, and said, "Negotiation on political matters  is literally a matter of life and death which (must) be handled by the (ANC)  itself through its appointed representatives."  </P> <P> He added: "My task is a very limited one, and that is to bring the country's  two major political bodies to the negotiating table. No prisoner, irrespective  of his status or influence, can conduct negotiations of this nature from  prison."  </P> <P> No one knows for sure what role the country's most-respected political prisoner  will play in the liberation movement once he is released. Mandela has described  himself as "a loyal and disciplined member of the ANC," and he has been meeting  with government leaders since 1986. Sources in the anti-apartheid movement say  Mandela will probably form part of its negotiating team.  </P> <P> President Frederik W. de Klerk has promised to create a climate for  negotiations, and a detailed plan is expected when Parliament convenes next  week.  </P> <P> De Klerk and his Cabinet are seeking ways to lift the 30-year ban on the ANC.  </P></p>

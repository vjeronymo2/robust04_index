			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Midland Bank rejects demand Midland Bank stood firm yesterday over a 2.25 per cent pay rise for its 20,000 clerical staff. It rejected union appeals for an increase after it had reported a sharp rise in profits. Bifu, the finance union, is balloting staff on plans for a series of one-day strikes next month if it achieves a mandate when voting ends on August 26. Members have already voted by three to one to reject the offer. Midland results, Page 19</p>

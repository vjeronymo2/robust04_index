			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DPA) -- Chancellor Kohl has said  that securing employment and creating jobs is the first joint  duty. "I am worried because we now have more than 4 million  unemployed in Germany as a whole," Kohl said on Friday [18  February], according to the prereleased text of his speech at  the opening of the Ambiente consumer products fair in Frankfurt.    In order to reduce unemployment, there must be a  considerable  increase in the number of part-time jobs offered, the chancellor  said. According to the text, the chancellor said the conclusion  of the collective agreement in the chemical industry with lower  pay for newly employed long-term unemployed and entrants is "an  important signal."    European Economic and Monetary Union, which entered its  second stage at the beginning of the year, is also a basis for  employment, growth, and prosperity in the FRG, Kohl said at the  beginning of the world's largest exhibition of consumer goods.  In 1992, Germany exported goods valued at 365 billion German  marks to countries of the European Union [EU]. Thus, since its  founding in 1957, Germany's exports to the EU countries  increased almost twice as much as to the rest of the world.    At the Ambiente spring fair, almost 4,800 exhibitors from  more than 70 countries are showing products for the table and  kitchen, household and lighting ideas, and fancy goods.</p>

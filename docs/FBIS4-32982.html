			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Six O'Clock Sharp" newscast] </F>   [Text] Nicaraguan Resistance Vice President Jose Rivas has  expressed his views on the Haitians refugees that the U.S. wants  Nicaragua to accept.    [Begin Rivas recording] We view the plight of the Haitians  as  regrettable. The Nicaraguan Government's policy is strictly for  export purposes. Here in Nicaragua we are very much aware of  the situation we are confronting. Here in Nicaragua more than  50 percent of the work force is unemployed. We do not believe  it would be advisable for people from other countries, in this  case Haiti, to come here when we cannot solve the problems of  the Nicaraguan people. The government has implemented many  economic plans that have not worked out. Many Nicaraguans  cannot understand why. I believe that if we were to accept  Haitian refugees in Nicaragua we would face situations which  would be difficult to describe at this time. We do not believe  Nicaragua should be a laboratory to test this type of social  program. They are overlooking the real situation experienced by  the Nicaraguan people. I do not believe this would be good for  us and it worries us. [end recording]</p>

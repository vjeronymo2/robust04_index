			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / France faces new outbreak of violence in urban areas THE French government's campaign against urban violence yesterday faced a fresh challenge in the shape of two outbreaks of rioting near Paris and the northern town of Tourcoing. In Argenteuil, north-west of the capital, bands of youths smashed shop windows and car windscreens, and threw petrol bombs late on Monday night, as a result of which eight were arrested. In Tourcoing, petrol bombs were thrown and a van set on fire after police tried to capture a stolen car being driven through the suburb of Bourgogne. A day earlier in Tourcoing, windows were broken and two cars set alight in clashes between youths and policemen. The Tourcoing disturbances were sparked after a young north African motorcyclist fell when police approached him for not wearing a helmet. A portable police radio was thrown, say eye-witnesses. At Argenteuil, the spark was the murder of a teenage Arab by a drug dealer. These new outbreaks are the latest in a two-year series of sporadic rioting, starting in a suburb of Lyon in September 1990. Ironically, this comes just a month after President Francois Mitterrand attributed the Los Angeles riots to the lack of social protection in the US. The French government, however, has made urban policy a big priority recently. It will spend more than FFr6.2bn on urban renewal, development and security this year. It has recently stepped up efforts to curb youth violence in the hot summer months, the highest risk time. Poverty and unemployment are thought to be factors in France's urban discontent. This twin problem was a factor in the decision three years ago to introduce a national minimum income (revenue minimum d'insertion) to help those inadequately covered by other kinds of social security. Plans to extend the scheme were yesterday presented to the National Assembly, which is likely to adopt the scheme in the current session.</p>

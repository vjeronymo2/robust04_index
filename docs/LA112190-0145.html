			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Save Our Bastanchury -- A report on Nov. 9 that the Save Our Bastanchury group  in Fullerton had sued the city over a ballot measure was incorrect. In fact,  the City Council has voted to sue the group over the wording of the ballot  measure, which would let voters decide whether Bastanchury Road should be  widened.  </P></p>

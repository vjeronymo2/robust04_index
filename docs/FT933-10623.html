			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Ashtead improves 22% to Pounds 2.76m ASHTEAD, the plant and machinery hire group, reported a 22 per cent increase in annual profits and said that current trading was 'well up on the same period last year and margins are now strengthening.' Pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 2.76m in the year to April 30 against Pounds 2.27m last time when profits were reduced by a Pounds 65,000 exceptional charge. Of the Pounds 489,000 increase, Pounds 386,000 came in the second half and Mr Peter Lewis, chairman, said the stronger second half performance had continued into the current year. Turnover increased by 10 per cent to Pounds 33.9m (Pounds 30.8m) with all three divisions achieving increased sales and rental income now accounting for 89 per cent of the total. Earnings per share rose 35 per cent to 9.7p (7.2p); an increased final dividend of 3.405p makes a total of 4.538p (4.125p). Mr Lewis said: 'The results reflect the strategy we have been pursuing since 1990. We have maintained investment, reshaped our customer base and entered new markets. As a consequence, and almost entirely through organic growth, we have increased our market share and strengthened the position of each of our businesses.' Total capital expenditure increased to Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 7.8m), including Pounds 8.8m on plant, comfortably exceeding the depreciation charge of Pounds 7.93m (Pounds 7.46m). Reflecting the high level of capital expenditure net borrowings increased to Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 8.4m) at the end of April, equivalent to gearing of 50 per cent, up from 43 per cent a year earlier. A-Plant, the core plant hire division, lifted turnover by some 7 per cent to Pounds 26.9m, further increased its market share, and reported trading profits of Pounds 9.73m (Pounds 9.39m). COMMENT Ashtead's strategy through the recession should stand it in good stead now the recovery appears to have arrived. The group has continued to invest heavily in new plant, has reduced its dependency on construction from 80 per cent of turnover in 1990 to less than 40 per cent today and has emphasised industrial plant hire, rather than sales. Although the hire market has shrunk, Ashtead has managed to boost market share and push up prices recently. Having climbed from a low of 90p last September the shares gained another 19p yesterday to close at 236p. With pre-tax profits of some Pounds 3.5m expected this year and earnings of 11.7p the shares are trading on a lofty prospective p/e of about 20, but are still worth buying on signs of weakness.</p>

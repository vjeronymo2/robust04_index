			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Zedillo swift to confront political tests: Mexican president plans big overhaul of judicial system Mexico's President Ernesto Zedillo has acted swiftly on two of the most pressing political challenges facing his new administration. He has unveiled plans for a sweeping overhaul of the judicial system and an accord designed to prevent violence during this week's transfer of power in the southern state of Chiapas. The judicial reform would allow Mr Zedillo to remove all Supreme Court magistrates and name a new court if he wishes, providing an opportunity to clean house only weeks into his six-year term. The reforms would also prohibit cabinet ministers and congressmen from being named to the court, thus ending the practice whereby it had become a refuge for out-of-favour politicians. The judicial reforms, detailed on Monday, involve changes to the constitution and require approval by both legislative chambers and state legislatures. They would award more power to the traditionally weak legislature by giving the Senate the authority to ratify the nation's attorney-general and Supreme Court justices after open hearings. Mr Zedillo's aides claim the reforms form a key component of a bigger agenda of political reform by strengthening the judicial and legislative branches of government at the expense of the president. But they also concede that the 'top down' approach of the reforms makes them 'just a beginning, and it will take the president's entire term for them to become fully functional'. Mr Zedillo is relying on Mr Antonio Lozano, the new attorney-general, to change the ethos and practices of the police, much criticised for corruption an ineffectiveness. On Monday Mr Lozano, a member of the conservative opposition National Action party, named fellow party members to all six top jobs in his law enforcement agency. Other aspects of the reforms include a mechanism allowing citizens to challenge inaction by prosecutors and police, as well as the constitutionality of federal, state and local laws. In Chiapas, scene of a bloody Indian uprising earlier this year, the interior ministry has reached an agreement with the self-styled State Democratic Assembly, which groups the state's leftist opposition. The accord calls for protesters to respect Thursday's swearing-in ceremony of governor-elect Mr Eduardo Robledo, and for the state government to respect the right to protest. The assembly, backed by the Zapatista rebels, claims Mr Robledo was fraudulently elected and had promised to use civil disobedience to prevent his taking office. The Zedillo administration has insisted Mr Robledo take office, saying its larger agenda of promoting the rule of law would be undermined if it began forcing governors to resign. It was not immediately clear if the agreement would be respected by all assembly members.</p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR HOLLYWOOD'S ELITE, A SPOT THAT'S STILL TOPS  </P> <P> "See you Monday night at Morton's."  </P> <P> It's as much a part of the Hollywood vernacular as "Let's do lunch," "My people  will call your people" and "I'll get back to you on that tomorrow."  </P> <P> The reason is sheer longevity: in a landscape littered with restaurants that  come and go as fast as B-rated movies, Morton's is marking its 10th anniversary  next month as the preferred West Coast watering hole for the heavy hitters of  the entertainment industry.  </P> <P> Some people can't even remember when it wasn't there. "I've been going to  Morton's most of my adult natural life," allows Barry Diller, the chairman of  Twentieth Century Fox.  </P> <P> "At any given point in time, there's always one restaurant which is the  high-priced commissary," says producer Steve Tisch ("Big Business," "Soul  Man"). "In the past, it was the Brown Derby, Chasen's and Scandia. And for my  generation, it clearly is Morton's."  </P> <P> And, on this particular Monday night at Morton's, everyone's where they should  be.  </P> <P> Near the window, producer Mark Johnson ("Rainman," "Good Morning, Vietnam") is  talking animatedly with comedian Robin Williams and his bride, Marsha. Up front  at separate tables, super-agents Ed Limato (ICM) and John Burnham (William  Morris) are doing deals with darting eyes. Off to one side, manager Molly  Madden is taking a meeting with actress/model Julianne Phillips, the Boss' ex.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Making an Entrance  </P> <P> On their car phones, MCA chairman Lew Wasserman and Disney chairman Michael  Eisner are announcing their imminent arrivals. And waiting to be seated are  music producer John Kalodner, TV actress Judith Light, movie muscleman Dolph  Lundgren and singer Pia Zadora, who waves to a friend already holding court  across the waiter-filled aisles.  </P> <P> Most restaurateurs would be in heaven to see these folks packed in potted palm  to potted palm. But as the man behind Morton's looks around the pink-lit power  palace he has erected at the corner of Melrose and Robertson in West Hollywood,  he can't help but stifle a yawn.  </P> <P> Because the secret's out. Frankly, my dah-ling, Peter Morton doesn't give a  damn.  </P> <P> "What drives me nuts is just the total preoccupation in this town with the  entertainment business -- where you go to dinner parties and which movies are  going to make money and who's going to a certain party -- and I think that's  boring," says the 41-year-old Chicago native, whose great-grandfather,  grandfather and father were all in the food business.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Another World  </P> <P> "And while I do have to make a living here and I'm not the sort of person that  is ungrateful to anybody, I think I've spent enough time outside this city to  understand that there are more important things at the end of the day other  than the film industry. And I thank God or whoever gave me enough smarts to  realize that there is another world out there."  </P> <P> A world that has made him very rich -- so rich, in fact, that he could buy and  sell many of Morton's regulars, thanks to his $80-million-a-year international  Hard Rock Cafe empire. Started in London in 1971, a cross between a burger  joint and a rock 'n' roll museum, the Hard Rock Cafe has become one of the  world's most successful privately held restaurant chains.  </P> <P> And with his wealth has come certain perks. Not just the sumptuous homes in  Coldwater Canyon, London and Honolulu he jets between, or the MOCA-quality  contemporary art he collects, or the Ferrari Mondial convertible he tools  around in. But, more importantly, the freedom not to have to cater to a  Hollywood elite that is so used to be catering to.  </P> <P> "Of course, certain people expect me to patronize them," Morton says  sardonically. "But fortunately I can operate Morton's in my unique way because  I have this other company on the side. You could almost say the Hard Rocks have  been my ticket out of Hollywood."  </P> <P> "One of the qualities I admire most about Peter is that the motion picture  business holds no glamour for him," says good friend Eric Eisner, president of  the David Geffen Co. "And although he is very respectful of movie executives  and appreciates their patronage, he respects their accomplishments no more or  less than he would respect the accomplishments of someone on Wall Street."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Staying on Top  </P> <P> But don't be fooled by his "what me worry?" demeanor. Because Morton already is  ensuring that his restaurant stays on top of the heap for another 10 years.  That's why next month he'll close Morton's briefly to give both the restaurant  and the menu a facelift.  </P> <P> "It's just time," Morton explains. "To be perfectly honest, I haven't been  tending the store as diligently as I could. I have let Morton's slip a little  bit. But I'm going to put some energy back into it and try to make up for a  little lost ground."  </P> <P> Slipping or not, Malcolm Forbes still lists Morton's as one of his three  favorite places in the world to eat. And when Laurence Tisch took over the  reins at CBS, he knew enough to head to Morton's during his first  meet-and-greet trip to Los Angeles. That famous talent warehouse, Creative  Artists Agency, deems Morton's one of only three "approved" restaurants for  expense-account dinners, so a frequent sight is Michael Ovitz wining and dining  client Kevin Costner at one end of the room while Ron Meyer toasts Madonna at  the other.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cutting Deals  </P> <P> For those keeping score, it was also at Morton's that Eisner, then with  Paramount, persuaded a young actor named Eddie Murphy to sign a multipicture  deal. And it was over dinner at Morton's again that Eisner decided to jump to  the Walt Disney company.  </P> <P> And, yet, to all except the most dedicated follower of the entertainment  industry, the people who frequent Morton's are not the sort whom the paparazzi  like to snap. If anything, they're more likely to wind up on the cover of  Fortune or Forbes than Fame magazine.  </P> <P> For example, while TV actress/producer Victoria Principal likes to take her  husband to Spago on weekends, she always takes her management meetings at  Morton's on weekdays. "So what I do is have my lawyer and my agent and my  publicist meet me at Morton's because it's such a pleasant atmosphere to do a  business dinner in," Principal explains.  </P> <P> In keeping with Hollywood's penchant for doing business over Morton's  brochettes, regulars like to tell about the time a middle-aged man suffered a  heart attack there. Even when he was carried away by paramedics on a gurney, so  the story goes, none of the diners bothered to stop their wheeling-dealing long  enough to look up and notice he was gone.  </P> <P> That may explain why Jack Nicholson feels comfortable enough to eat dinner  alone at the bar some evenings. Or why Pia Zadora has serenaded the restaurant  accompanied by her daughter Kady playing her plastic guitar. Or why actor James  Woods got down on one knee during dinner last January and asked his girlfriend,  Sarah Owen, for her hand in marriage.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Best Seats  </P> <P> Naturally, like any L.A. restaurant, there are "good" tables -- and there is  Siberia. According to conventional wisdom, the better the artwork, the worse  the table.  </P> <P> Of course, some of Morton's original investors, like producers Jerry Weintraub  and Allan Carr and singer Tina Sinatra, are guaranteed good seating. There even  used to be an official "Jerry Weintraub" table marked by a small wall plaque,  which had to be removed when the restaurant installed French doors three years  ago. "But when Jerry comes in, he still likes to sit near there," notes Pam  Morton, Peter's fraternal twin and the restaurant's manager.  </P> <P> Even so, not everyone wants to sit at the "best" tables -- Nos. 4 and 6 in the  front. For instance, Pam Morton once saved a much-sought-after table for two in  the front for Barbara Walters even though someone else seated at the rear was  ready to kill for it.  </P> <P> "Then Barbara walks in, and it turns out she wants to sit in the back," Pam  Morton laughs. A quick switch, and suddenly everyone was happy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Busiest Nights  </P> <P> Almost from the beginning and continuing to this day, Morton's is hottest on  Monday and Thursday nights. That's when the power is truly palpable, regulars  say.  </P> <P> "You never go on a weekend," noted Harris Katleman, president of Twentieth  Century Fox television. "We call it 'civilian' night."  </P> <P> "My theory, based on observation," says writer Ben Stein, "is that it's because  people in the biz are so biz-oriented that they get restless over the weekends  being home with their families, and by Monday they're dying to be out and  talking deals.  </P> <P> "And on Thursday, they're just stocking up on deals to make it through the  weekend."  </P> <P> With its well-spaced tables (no eavesdropping allowed), muted acoustics (to  make whispering easier) and simple but solid food (watch those cholesterol  counts, remember!), it's clear why Morton's has withstood the test of time.  "There's nothing trendy about it. And that's because Peter doesn't wear  Japanese suits," Eric Eisner kids.  </P> <P> "It's just direct and straight and easy," agent John Burnham notes, "which is  very similar to Peter."  </P> <P> It's 11 p.m. on this Monday night, and the last Rolls-Royce and Porsche parked  under Morton's green neon sign have disappeared. Peter Morton, dressed preppily  as usual in a tennis sweater and jeans, glances around his restaurant one last  time before getting up to leave.  </P> <P> "You know," he relates, "Jonathan Tisch (the nephew of CBS chief Laurence  Tisch), called up and asked if I'd put a Morton's in the CBS Building in New  York. But I just really have been too busy to consider undertaking such a  thing."  </P> <P> He stares into space for a moment. And then a smile comes to his face.  "Obviously, from a clientele standpoint, it wouldn't be duplicated. Because  there's only one Hollywood."  </P></p>

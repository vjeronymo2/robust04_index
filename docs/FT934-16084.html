			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / 'Serious money' sought for home rentals SIR George Young, the housing minister, said discussions were taking place with pension funds and insurance companies about the action needed to secure the investment of 'serious long-term money' in residential accommodation. He contrasted the readiness of financial institutions to invest in high-quality rented flats in Paris and New York with their unwillingness to do so in Britain. Sir George said he was working with City institutions and builders to find a way to develop the policies which had proved successful in halting the decline in the private rented sector. He described it as a 'paradox' that after 14 consecutive years of Conservative government, the rented market was still dominated by the public sector. Sir George noted that three quarters of those occupying rented accommodation were either tenants of a local authority or a housing association. He did not comment on a call by Mr Mark Tennant, a director of the largest private rented property company in the UK, for the ending of tax relief on mortgage interest for owner-occupiers. Mr Tennant admitted that in advocating such a step he would be as popular as 'Attila the Hun', but insisted that there could not be 'a level playing field' so long as tax relief on mortgage interest continued. He also pressed for the streamlining of the legal processes for securing the payment of rent arrears. Sir George confirmed that the government intended to change the legislation on providing housing for the homeless so that unmarried pregnant teenagers were more likely to be accommodated in hostels rather than flats. He emphasised the need to distinguish between providing 'an essential safety net' and a device for jumping the housing queue.</p>

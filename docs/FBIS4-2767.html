			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 12 (XINHUA) -- The State  Administration of Taxation (SAT) will launch an inspection on  personal income taxation during the latter half of this year, in  a clear gesture to tighten the crackdown on individual tax  evasion and cheating.    "We will severely punish tax evaders and cheaters as well as  those who threaten and do physical harm to tax collectors,"  pledged Li Yonggui, vice-director of the SAT.    "The present punishment, mainly through fines, has hardly  worked. The serious tax violators must be brought to court and  sentenced according to law," Li said.    China instituted a new law on individual income tax on  January 1st this year. Under the new law, salaries or wages of  Chinese citizens must be taxed after a deduction of 800 yuan.  The deduction amount for foreigners in China is 4,000 yuan.  But in both cases, the highest tax rate is 45 percent.    As the national economy booms and especially with the latest  overhaul of the wage system of government staff, the ranks of  taxpayers have swelled.    The state tax authorities today asked all government  functionaries, starting from this month, to fulfill their duties  by deducting the due tax from their staff's wages or salaries on  behalf of the tax administration.    "High-placed officials with the party Central Committee, the  State Council and some of the ministries have either paid taxes  or have had taxes deducted by relevant departments," said Li.    Li disclosed that by the end of March, the country had  collected 1.304 billion yuan in personal income tax, an increase  of 470 million yuan, or up 56.2 percent over the same period of  last year.</p>

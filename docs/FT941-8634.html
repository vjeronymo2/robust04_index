			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Tring Int places 49.9% with ease Tring International, the recording company which faces legal action from several larger competitors, yesterday announced that the placing of 49.9 per cent of its enlarged share capital had been substantially oversubscribed. The shares were priced at 118p, giving the company a market capitalisation of Pounds 50.2m. It expects pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.1m for the year to March 31. Expected earnings per share of 8.42p put the shares on a prospective multiple of 14 at their placing price. Dealings begin next Wednesday. Mr Philip Keane, finance director, accepted that some potential investors might be wary because of the copyright litigation Tring faced, but he thought the shares had been priced realistically. Tring is being sued by MCA, PolyGram and K-Tel International for alleged copyright infringement. Last month it agreed to pay Pounds 20,000 to EMI Music, which had sued it for breach of copyright. The company has said it does not expect the litigation to have a significant financial impact. Mr Philip Robinson, joint chief executive, said none of Tring's 800 album titles represented more than 1.5 per cent of sales. Mr Mark Frey, the other joint chief executive, said the litigation affected 70 musical tracks out of more than 8,000 in the company's catalogue. Mr Robinson said that the company had indemnities from its licensors, ensuring that Tring would be reimbursed for damages paid and the complainants' legal costs if licences proved to be invalid. The company also said yesterday that it was issuing 2.5m new shares, raising Pounds 1.4m net of expenses. Mr Frey and Mr Robinson were receiving Pounds 3.7m each from the placing, although each will retain a 12.37 per cent stake in the company. The remaining shares which were not placed yesterday are held by other directors and investors. Tring said that it would have paid a net dividend of 3.8p if it had been listed throughout the current financial year, giving a notional gross yield of 4 per cent at the placing price.</p>

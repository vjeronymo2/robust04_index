			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESCUING ANDEAN ECONOMIES FROM COCAINE;  </P> <P> DRUGS: WE ALREADY SWAP THIRD WORLD DEBT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION, SO WHY NOT  TRY THE SAME THING IN THE DRUG WAR?  </P> <P> Like the drug menace in this country, narcotics are deeply rooted in South  America, where cocaine profits play an integral role in the Andean economy and  daily violence in Colombia and Peru threatens democratic institutions. But the  drug-producing nations of the Andes bear another burden -- external debt --  that seriously inhibits their ability to fight the drugwar.  </P> <P> The "Andean strategy" outlined by President Bush is notably silent on this  problem. We must correct this flaw, and one way to do so would be to link debt  relief to anti-drug efforts.  </P> <P> This initiative is not motivated by charity. It simply recognizes the  undeniable link between debt and drugs in the Andes, where large debt burdens  make both debt service and a full-scale war on drugs fiscally impossible.  </P> <P> The Andean economies have become "hooked" on drugs. Repatriated cocaine profits  account for an estimated 10% of all export earnings in Colombia, one-quarter in  Peru and one-half or more in Bolivia. As many as 500,000 Bolivians, nearly  one-third of the labor force, are involved in the drug trade. Little wonder  that former Bolivian Finance Minister Flavio Machicado has said: "If narcotics  were to disappear overnight, we would have rampant unemployment. There would be  open protest and violence."  </P> <P> The "debt-for-drug swaps" that I propose are modeled on  debt-for-nature-preservation exchanges that have already been successfully  negotiated in Latin America. Under this plan, the United States, with the help  of our European and Japanese allies, would create an international fund to  acquire a portion of the external debt of the Andean nations at discounted  rates. The fund would then forgive the interest payments -- and ultimately the  principal -- on this debt in return for the successful implementation of  anti-narcotics programs.  </P> <P> Swapping debt for drugs would give the economies of the Andes room to breathe  and provide increased resources for the war on drugs. Debt relief, which would  still be contingent on continued economic reforms, can leverage more money than  foreign aid, because the debt of the countries involved -- Bolivia, Colombia  and Peru -- has already been discounted from face value by lender banks.  Governments can also use local currency to implement new anti-drug programs,  rather than the precious foreign reserves that must go to debt service.  </P> <P> This approach will fail unless we alter our current strategy of forcibly  eradicating coca fields in South America, which by all measures has been  self-defeating. The Andes are awash in coca. Forced eradication, especially in  Peru, has alienated peasant farmers, driving them into the arms of  anti-government insurgents.  </P> <P> Why this failure? One reason is that forced eradication temporarily raises the  price of the coca leaf, as less raw material is available to suppliers. The  higher price attracts more farmers, who plant new coca crops in the warm ashes  of recently eradicated fields.  </P> <P> Instead of destroying their fields, we should offer farmers an economic  alternative to coca cultivation while continuing vigorous enforcement against  the traffickers. Prices for coca leaf fall when such enforcement is sustained.  Fearing that prices may bottom out, farmers become desperate to unload their  coca and would switch to other crops if they could find help to weather the  transition. Debt-for-drug swaps would make more funds available for such  economic alternatives.  </P> <P> These debt swaps have other benefits. The Andean nations would invest in their  own rural economies instead of using foreign exchange to pay creditors.  Economic-development programs would drive a wedge between the cartels and the  growers, giving governments more freedom to take on the traffickers. Just as  important, the legitimacy of the fledgling democracies in Bolivia and Peru --  and a longstanding democracy in Colombia -- would be greatly enhanced.  </P> <P> Like the ghettos of our nation's cities, the jungles of South America are the  front line of the drug war. But just as tough law enforcement on the street is  doomed unless accompanied by treatment and education, the best eradication  programs will fail if they leave only burned and fallow fields. Indeed, coca  and cocaine will spring endlessly from the ruins of debt-ridden and  drug-dependent Andean economies unless we help them rebuild their legal  sectors.  </P> <P> The drug menace terrorizes all the nations of the Americas with a vengeance,  corroding our families, our institutions and our societies. We must work  together to attack this problem, or together we will continue to suffer the  consequences. Swapping debt for drugs is one way for all Americans -- North and  South -- to make common cause against the blight on our Hemisphere.  </P></p>

Sulaiman Ali, leader of  one of the lost commands said the new wave of kidnapping will  start at the close of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The  month-long fasting of Muslims ended on Sunday.    Ali, however, denied responsibility in the kidnapping of  five  school teachers in Tuburan, Basilan last 7 March. He demanded a  pull out of the marines from Tuburan, saying that more people  will be abducted by his group starting this month if the marine  troops will not be pulled out.</p>

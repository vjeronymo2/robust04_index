			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Portillo the young pretender triumphs With Elgar ringing in their ears, Conservative activists left Bournemouth yesterday reflecting on a week that produced little glory but rekindled hopes that the party might yet recover to win a fifth successive general election. Unlike last week's Labour gathering in Blackpool, the 111th Tory party conference passed with little sense of occasion, and no great victories or defeats for the leadership. But Bournemouth was not equally kind to the nearly two dozen ministers who addressed the troops. At least three left with their reputations enhanced. The great bulk did little or nothing to affect their standing. One - a surprise - was a relative failure. The winners were led by Mr John Major, the prime minister. Buoyed by the absence of a challenge to his leadership he wrapped himself in the union flag to deliver a relaxed and confident speech designed to send supporters away happy. Mr Jeremy Hanley, party chairman, was a surprise success. He had a bad start, failing to turn up when he was expected. But the representatives gave a warm welcome to his two speeches, laughing at his jokes and cheering his anti-Labour sallies. The other winner was Mr Michael Portillo, employment secretary, whose four-minute ovation for a clearly anti-European speech was the longest of the week - except for Mr Major's 5 1/2 minutes. Mr Portillo appeared to have widened his support among rank-and-file activists, but some good judges are already saying that he may come to regret identifying himself so closely with factional politics. The surprise loser was Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, who won only a two-minute ovation and seemed to have lost his unofficial title of conference darling to Mr Portillo. However, Mr Heseltine achieved his main aim - showing that he remains as vigorous a performer as ever following his recovery from a heart attack last year. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, delivered a good speech poorly, throwing away most of the best lines, but was able to claim wide support for his steady-as-she-goes economic policy. The debate on law and order was expected to prompt criticism of Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, but did not. Mr Howard was booed only when he made clear that the government favoured voluntary rather than compulsory ID cards. Among the cabinet middleweights Mrs Gillian Shephard made a confident debut as education secretary, even though her best ideas were appropriated by the prime minister for his end-of-conference speech. Others, including Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, and Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, delivered largely routine speeches without adding significantly to their support. The two cabinet newcomers who addressed the conference, Dr Brian Mawhinney at transport and Mr Stephen Dorrell at national heritage, were both regarded as solid performers, likely to risk a more aggressive approach next year. There were other winners and losers. Conservative Way Forward, the rightwing lobby group, won the battle of the fringe with the biggest and best attended meetings. In a sign of the times, the Campaign for Europe achieved only a third of last year's turnout, in spite of boasting Sir Leon Brittan, UK European commissioner, as its main speaker.</p>

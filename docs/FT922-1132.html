			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Moldova youths flaunt the machines of war WHEN their armoured personnel carrier was disabled in the bloody fighting in Bendery, eastern Moldova, which claimed hundreds of lives over the weekend, Sergei, Slava and Sasha replaced it more casually than American teenagers getting a new set of wheels after a car accident. 'We just went to the 59th Division of the 14th Army, spoke with the local commander and he gave us this baby,' said 21-year-old Sergei Zubkov, a fighter with the Trans Dnestr forces who are attempting to break away from Moldova and have won the help of the Russian army. 'The commander and the boys of the 59th Division all know us, so they gave us a new APC,' he said, proudly banging the coffee-coloured metal sides of the vehicle he now drives. Like many young men driving powerful new machines, Mr Zubkov is only too happy to offer admirers a lift. Racing with him across the bridge over the Dnestr river - the most important strategic point in the region - is an oddly cheerful experience. The boys generously offer a nibble of their food or a drag of the cigarettes they smoke in complete disregard for the brand new ammunition stacked high inside their carrier and present a few bullets as souvenirs. The scene appeared to turn ugly when the APC pulled up to the bullet-ridden city council building in Bendery, which is at the heart of the bloody battle between the Slavic separatists and the forces of Moldova, whose population is of predominantly ethnic Romanian origin. A square-jawed man toting a machine-gun emerged to provide cover against Moldovan snipers. He turned out to be Mr Viacheslav Kogut, the mayor, and offered to talk for 10 minutes 'because then the next attack is due to start'. Huddled in a crowded basement room where stockpiles of increasingly scarce bread vied for space with bandages, Mr Kogut's answers were peppered with grim questions from his assistants. What to do with the hundreds of corpses rotting in the streets? Bury them, was the no-nonsense answer. A desperate woman called wondering how to flee the city. 'Walk across the bridge like everyone else,' snapped the mayor, then slammed down the receiver and launched into a diatribe on the ways in which the Soviet regime had deprived its citizens of individual initiative. The interview came to an abrupt halt when a fresh attack forced the building to be evacuated. Sergei, Slava and Sasha were gone. But, more readily than a taxi in downtown London, two young drivers of another APC volunteered to drive back across the river.</p>

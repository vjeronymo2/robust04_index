			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / UK shares rise on hopes of rate cut SHARE prices in London rose yesterday on speculation that Britain might cut base rates next week around the time of the world economic summit. While the market rumours led to renewed buying interest in equities, they led some investors to switch funds out of sterling, the weakest member of the European exchange rate mechanism. The FT-SE 100 index recovered some of its losses of earlier in the week, closing up 21.0 at 2,497.1. But the pound fell back three-quarters of a pfennig against the D-Mark to finish at DM2.895, down 1 3/4 pfennigs on the week. Given the pound's weakness, an early move by Britain on base rates, held at 10 per cent since May 5, is considered unlikely. Government officials, in a briefing ahead of next week's summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in Munich, said they did not expect any immediate commitments at the meeting to reduce interest rates. A technical manoeuvre in the money markets by the Bank of England - which shaved by  1/32 of a percentage point its rates on long-maturing bills - was responsible for the expectations about a cut in base rates. Any such move would follow Thursday's cut in US interest rates, and might stimulate Britain's flagging economy. It would win the support of many industrialists and politicians. But a decision by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to reduce borrowing costs would risk sterling falling close to the bottom of its ERM band. The manoeuvre might be deemed especially hazardous, given that base rates are only  1/4 point above the equivalent short-term rates in Germany. With many traders in the money markets less than confident that Mr Lamont was about to take the plunge, the three-month interbank rate - a good reflection of sentiment about the future level of base rates - fell by just  1/16 of a point to 9 27/32 per cent.

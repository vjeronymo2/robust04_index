			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / UK confident of oil blaze contracts MR John Wakeham, UK energy secretary, said yesterday he had 'every reason to believe' that British companies would soon receive substantial contracts to help cap Kuwait's blazing oil wells. Senior UK oil industrialists who accompanied Mr Wakeham on his three-day visit to the emirate also said they were confident of winning a share of the fire-fighting and capping work, now being undertaken by three US companies and a Canadian group. The British delegation is among groups from around the world, including China and the Soviet Union, which have responded to the Kuwait government's appeal this month for more help in fighting the fires. However, no further contracts have yet been confirmed. Mr Wakeham told reporters yesterday he expected contracts towards repairing Kuwait's oil production facilities to amount eventually to 'a good many billions of dollars'. He added: 'I have every reason to believe the Kuwait Oil Company will be asking a British team to do some of the work.' The British delegation, headed by Mr Basil Butler, president of the Institute of Petroleum and a former chairman of the Kuwait Oil Company, is offering expertise in management and damage assessment, as well as in direct fire-fighting. British fire-fighters would be expected to concentrate on blazes in northern oilfields, where no capping has begun. Many of the delegation stressed UK expertise in addressing the fires by drilling relief wells, rather than by tackling the well-head. Mr Butler said it was too early to examine how long it might take to extinguish the fire, but said there was little prospect of this within a year.  More than 60 wells have been capped so far of the more than 500 set alight by the Iraqis.</p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Operating strength lifts A McAlpine shares The share price of Alfred McAlpine jumped by 35p to 329p yesterday after the construction group announced a better than expected operating performance for the year to October 31. As expected, provisions of Pounds 6.5m were made to cover potential losses on a housing joint venture, construction contracts, reorganisation, and a Pounds 500,000 loss on disposals. These reduced pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.17m, against Pounds 3.39m restated for FRS 3. Turnover rose from Pounds 560.7m to Pounds 620.7m. Before exceptional items, profits rose from Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 7.7m. This was after an interest bill of Pounds 3.33m (Pounds 2.66m). The improvement was led by the housing division, which after interest more than doubled profits to Pounds 5.51m (Pounds 2.58m). Mr Oliver Whitehead, chief executive, said the recovery in the UK housing market had seen higher sales and improved margins and was 'unlikely to be upset by higher tax bills due to take effect in April'. Earnings per share before exceptional items increased to 9.6p (7.3p). After taking account of provisions, earnings fell from to 4.8p to 0.7p. The final dividend is maintained at 3.5p, for a same-again total of 6.5p. The number of homes completed rose by a fifth to 1,521. The average price remained static at Pounds 79,400. Mr Whitehead expected prices to rise over the next 12 months to Pounds 90,000. Profits from contracting rose marginally to Pounds 3.03m (Pounds 2.9m) in spite of an 8 per cent rise in construction turnover to Pounds 371.5m, reflecting low margins. UK aggregate profits fell from Pounds 1.86m to Pounds 1.19m. In the US, profits from contracting and building materials were lower than expected at Pounds 1.68m (Pounds 1.84m). The group is changing its year end to December 31. COMMENT The fillip in McAlpine's share price had as much to do with optimism about the company's prospects as with market satisfaction over a better than expected operating performance. Margins on housing are rising satisfactorily, without some of the big write-downs announced by other builders. This means the company has more to gain as it uses up expensive land acquired in the late 1980s. Management also appears to have a tight grip on the construction business and is confident that it will avoid serious problems on low margin contracts caused by rising building material prices. The US business remains strong and the group should be capable of making Pounds 13m in the current year and up to Pounds 19m in 1994-95. This would put McAlpine on a prospective p/e of 14 times earnings two years on, making the shares still look reasonably attractive in a sector which is at a substantial premium to the rest of the market.</p>

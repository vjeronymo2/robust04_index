			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: Thames TV clears way for bid as profits surge THAMES Television is selling Reeves Entertainment, its loss-making US production company, in a move that is expected to clear the way for a bid from Pearson, the publishing, banking and industrial group. Lord Brabourne, chairman of Thames, said yesterday that the company was 'in advanced discussions' with the management of Reeves about a possible buy-out. His statement came at the same time as Thames announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 44.4m in the year to end-December - its last as an ITV company - compared with Pounds 8.2m. However, after extraordinary items of Pounds 93.4m and the interim dividend the loss for the year was Pounds 68.8m. The accounts were prepared on a pre-FRS 3 basis. Lord Brabourne also said yesterday that 'discussions regarding a possible offer for Thames by Pearson have advanced, but agreement has not yet been reached.' Neither side would comment further on the talks although Pearson, which owns the Financial Times, has made it clear that it is interested in expanding in the media. The present market capitalisation of Thames, which is controlled by Thorn EMI, is Pounds 88.7m. Reeves has never fulfilled Thames' hopes since the UK broadcaster bought it for about Pounds 57m. It lost Pounds 10.3m last year. The provisions on the purchase include Pounds 51.5m in goodwill previously written off to reserves plus Pounds 22.8m, mainly for programme costs not yet amortised. Further provisions of Pounds 19.1m were made in the UK because of the loss of the ITV franchise, almost all because of property and equipment rationalisation costs. The provisions mean that Thames has no distributable reserves so there will be no final dividend. The Thames chairman said the directors intend to bring forward proposals for a reduction in capital to try to resume dividend payments as soon as possible. The company has also revalued its 9.6 per cent stake in SES, the operator of the Astra satellite system, to Pounds 20m in line with third party transactions. Lord Brabourne said Thames' interest in taking part in programme services 'remains undiminished' although the company still thought it 'deeply unsatisfactory' that the Independent Television Commission had not re-advertised a Channel 5 licence. Despite the high costs of restructuring Lord Brabourne said that programmes such as The Bill, Mr Bean and Wish You Were Here, the programme library and investments in both programme services such as UK Gold and Astra 'provide Thames with the opportunity of benefiting from expansion in the television industry worldwide.' Thames shares fell 5p to 174p.</p>

			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Letter: Ruff universe theory may be a cut above the rest Sir, The missing mass in the universe is indeed an intriguing mystery. As one who tried to tie up all of 1992's loose ends in the time between Christmas and the new year, I turned to this more tractable problem and came up with a much simpler idea than the invisible matter explanations suggested by Clive Cookson ('Mystery of missing mass', December 29). Imagine that our familiar three dimensions could somehow be squashed down on to the two dimensions of a gigantic strip of lace and then elegantly bent back and forth to make an enormous Elizabethan ruff. And suppose that light and matter could not leave the ruff's surface but gravity could. Then in any two-dimensional locality where not much matter was present, one might still feel some big gravitational effect from bodies in a neighbouring ruffle. In fact, depending on the closeness of ruffles, inhabitants of this crinkly universe might experience many times the gravitational pull they would expect from observing within the ruff's surface the density of matter. Mr Cookson tells us that astronomers observe precisely this of our unsquashed universe. So perhaps there is no need to squash our universe down and fold it up to get crinkliness. Perhaps, rather, the fact that we observe extra gravitational attraction in space is evidence that our universe is already crinkled up in some fourth dimension. What else? Could black holes be points where the 'lace' of one 'ruffle' touches the next? Could the Great Wall simply be a manifestation of crinkliness on a gigantic scale? Ingenious explanations for all sorts of observed cosmic irregularities and singularities might follow. Perhaps crinkliness occurs at several different scales. Could that explain why quanta - which always seemed rather arbitrary to me - appear as bitty as they do? But the real appeal of crinkliness as an idea is that, if true, we are much closer to other planets and galaxies than our conventional geometries tell us we are. Until now, it has been depressing to think that the stars are utterly beyond our practical reach. It would be wonderful if there were short cuts - jumping from one ruffle to the next, so to speak - so that, in due course, like the USS Enterprise, spaceships might carry man great distances across space.

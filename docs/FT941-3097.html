			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Grolsch forecasts improvement Grolsch, the Dutch brewer, posted virtually flat results in 1993 but it expects to see a 'significant' rise in 1994, due in part to the recent overhaul of its strategy in Britain and Germany. Declining beer markets in north-west Europe caused net profit to remain at Fl 43.5m (Dollars 22.9m) compared with Fl 43.4m in 1992, on turnover down 8.5 per cent at Fl 793.5m. Since the start of 1994, Grolsch has set up a distribution joint venture with Bass, the UK's largest brewer, to boost sales in Britain and Ireland. It has also announced the sale of Wickuler, its subsidiary in Germany, to the German brewer Brau und Brunnen, in return for a distribution pact that will give Grolsch entry to 6,000 cafes across Germany within five years. These changes, plus efficiency measures at home, should lead to a significant improvement in 1994. Mr Paul Snoep, chairman, said Grolsch did not rule out future acquisitions. But in contrast to the 1991 acquisition of Wickuler, which gave Grolsch a range of local beers and the prospects of a gradual introduction of its own brand in Germany, any takeover must have as its prime goal the accelerated expansion of the Grolsch brand. He denied that the Wickuler investment represented a failure in corporate policy, saying it had given Grolsch the opportunity to enter into a partnership with Brau und Brunnen and achieve a breakthrough in distribution. In the UK, the Bass deal will give the British brewer the right to produce Grolsch beer locally, with the exception of beer bottled in Grolsch's trademark swing-top bottles. The move is a departure for Grolsch, which was previously keen to set itself apart in the UK by being a foreign-brewed beer. But Mr Snoep said, 'Extensive market research has shown that UK consumers are used to drinking foreign lagers that are brewed and bottled in the UK.' Grolsch had no plans for a similar production arrangement in the US, its second biggest market.</p>

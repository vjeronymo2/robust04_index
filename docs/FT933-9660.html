			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Osman to be freed later this month MR Lorrain Osman, former chairman of Bumiputra Malaysia Finance, will be freed later this month, almost eight years after he was arrested on charges of fraud in connection with the collapsed Carrian group, writes Simon Davies in Hong Kong. The remaining 15 criminal charges against Mr Osman were dropped on Friday, leaving the Malaysian banker to complete a one-year sentence handed out in June. His jail term has been reduced by good behaviour and time already spent in prison. Carrian, a Hong Kong listed property and shipping group, collapsed in 1983 with bad debts of more than USDollars 1bn (Pounds 660m). The subsequent legal battle has been the longest and most costly in Hong Kong's history. Carrian's managing director, Mr George Tan, was acquitted in 1988 of conspiracy to defraud shareholders in a decision which a leading lawyer described as 'bizarre and irrational'. Mr Tan will face further bribery charges next month. In June Mr Osman pleaded guilty to charges of con-spiring to defraud Bumiputra Malaysia Finance by authorising USDollars 292m of loans to a company controlled by Mr Tan. The company had no assets and paid-up capital of only HKDollars 2. The case has cost Hong Kong taxpayers more than HKDollars 100m (Pounds 8.7m).</p>

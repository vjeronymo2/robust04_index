			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / DTI lends ASB top hand THE ACCOUNTING Standards Board is to recruit a senior official from the Department of Trade and Industry to help it make accounts easier to understand, Andrew Jack writes. Mr Michael Butcher, head of accounting and audit policy at the DTI, is to join the board on secondment for at least a year from August. He will help to make draft standards issued by the board less wordy and technical. He will also start work on a two-three year project producing guidelines on the inclusion of a statement in annual accounts to clarify financial information to non-professionals. Mr David Tweedie, head of the board, has long said he wants to make accounts more understandable. But critics have accused the ASB of producing standards that are highly technical and increasingly difficult for non-professional investors to use. Mr Butcher will become secretary to the board but there will be no change to its number of staff. The appointment has been driven partly by demands on the time of Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the financial reporting council, the board's parent body, in his role as School Curriculum and Assessment Authority chairman.</p>

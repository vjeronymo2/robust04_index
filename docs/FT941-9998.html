			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Observer: Elderly queue The good news for the 1.2m depositors in Venezuela's second-largest bank, Banco Latino, which went bust last month, is that the Venezuelan government has promised that many small depositors will be able to get their money back straightaway. The bad news, for some of the bigger customers, is that they might have to wait a while, if history is any guide. Venezuela's financial authorities announced only this week that 1,000 customers of Banco Tachira would finally get their money back. It was rescued by the government in 1958 . . .</p>

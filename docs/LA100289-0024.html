			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> DOOBIES' ROCK IS JUST ALL RIGHT  </P> <P> Reunite a famous '60s band like the Who, the Jefferson Airplane or the Rolling  Stones, and all sorts of questions arise about the propriety of honored  innovators and standard-setters coming back to cash in with one last gravy run.  </P> <P> But reunite a '70s band like the Doobie Brothers, and there's hardly a need to  ask anything.  </P> <P> The Doobies, like many of their high-profile '70s brethren, retreated from the  '60s vision of rock as a cultural battlefield or a burgeoning movement to be  infused with high creative ideals. The group, which took its name from a slang  term for a marijuana cigarette, saw rock as a backing track for an easygoing  good time. The one-time bar band from San Jose never sang about how the storm  was threatening their very life today, or about people putting down their  generation. No, the most telling line from the Doobies' signature song, "Listen  to the Music," went: "What the people need is a way to make 'em smile / It  ain't so hard to do if you know how."  </P> <P> Given that limited vision, the reunited Doobie Brothers don't have to carry the  extra musical burdens under which the returning '60s vets have labored. The  only question they had to answer Friday at the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa  Mesa was the one common to all bar bands and nostalgia acts: Do they still have  the skill and enthusiasm to breathe momentary freshness into a batch of old  favorites?  </P> <P> The answer was good enough to get a few thousand nostalgic thirtysomething  types up and dancing through much of the Doobies' brisk, 90-minute set of  faithfully rendered hits. Led by Patrick Simmons and Tom Johnston, the band's  two founding singer-guitarists, the nine-man lineup capably reproduced the  distinctive high-wall-of-voices harmonies, rolling rhythms and commercially  glossy synthesis of country, soul and rock 'n' roll roots.  </P> <P> The Doobies did play six songs from their successful reunion album, "Cycles."  But the new material hews to the band's old style, the Doobies having been  sufficiently honest -- and market-savvy -- to stick with proven old ways  instead of trying to sound falsely "contemporary." Certain songs from "Cycles"  convey a depth that the Doobie Brothers' early music lacked, a sense of life  lived with struggles and disappointments. Otherwise, it was pretty much  good-times as usual for the Doobies, a way to make the people smile.  </P> <P> While the "Cycles" lineup is drawn from the Doobies' early '70s incarnation  that centered on Simmons and Johnston, the show included a few songs from the  later period marked by Michael McDonald's sophisticated white-soul style  (McDonald, the only Doobie Brother who went on to solo success in the '80s, is  not part of the reunion). Sidemen Cornelius Bumpus (a late-period Doobie) and  Richard Bryant helped carry the McDonald songs off, but the Doobies were at  their best with more rocking material, including feisty renditions of such  chestnuts as "Rockin' Down the Highway," "Jesus Is Just Alright" and "Long  Train Runnin'."  </P> <P> Simmons and Johnston had little to say in perfunctory song introductions, but  they probably realized that their repertoire alone was enough to give the show  a ready-made sense of connection and familiarity.  </P> <P> That, of course, is the problem with rock nostalgia: The whole experience is  ready-made. Real excitement comes from watching a band -- whether new or old --  that still has the capacity to surprise itself and its audience. The Doobies  can't be accused of playing by rote. But, Friday, the Doobies' safe, familiar  rock was just alright -- and that's about all.  </P></p>

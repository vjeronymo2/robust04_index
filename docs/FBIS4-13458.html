			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Chief Editor Salah al-Mukhtar: "What Does the </F> Flow of Delegations into Iraq Mean?"]    [Excerpts] There is a new eye-catching phenomenon in the  life of our country, bringing happiness into the hearts of the  Iraqis, who are full love for Iraq and its independence. This  is because this phenomenon produces new and categorical evidence  that the front of the hostile forces that have imposed the  criminal comprehensive blockade is disintegrating. After the  split which took place at the UN Security Council and led to the  emergence of a majority supporting Iraq's rightful demand that  the blockade be lifted, there has been a noticeable increase in  the flow of Arab and world figures and delegations arriving into  Iraq, both publicly and officially, making the point that they  want to assert their support for Iraq and condemnation of the  blockade.    A quick glance at yesterday's press reports on the visiting  delegations and figures is enough to make us realize the great  and positive changes which have turned into a phenomenon  pleasing Iraq and lovers of freedom and disheartening the slaves  of evil and the Satan occupying the White House.    The press reports noted the arrival of two Italian economic  and parliamentary delegations, a German economic delegation, a  French media-commercial delegation, two Belgian delegations, a  Jordanian delegation led by a deputy prime minister, a Romanian  minister, and Bishop Capucci, who arrived to voice his  solidarity. [passage omitted]    The public flow of delegations and officials and their  unanimous support for Iraq and the expression of their desire to  have trade with Iraq has a profound, clear, and significant  message. It tells us that the world--both states and  institutions--has become weary of and unprepared to tolerate the  U.S. excesses anymore. It also shows that the world has freed  itself of many of the factors of fear and hesitation, taking  moves to condemn the U.S. colonialism and support Iraq. In this  vein, the visits to Iraq break the cordon of isolation that the  United States has imposed with force and terror.    This positive phenomenon complements and supports another  phenomenon, which is the rift in the stands of the UN Security  Council member states on Iraq. This is because by expressing  its support for Iraq, the world public opinion offers support  for the states that have changed their stands and begun to  demand that the blockade be lifted. Besides, the presence of  official trade delegations is yet further evidence that  circumstances are getting ripe for the end of the blockade. In  the past, foreign companies used to visit Iraq for secret talks  on future contracts. But now, they are publicly declaring their  decisions regarding Iraq.    What does all that mean? It means, among many other things,  that the Iraqi people's steadfastness and sacrifices have  provided a solid basis for the world to review and reconsider  its stands. This is just the beginning. Bill Clinton, who  furiously and stupidly watches these developments, should  prepare his cheek, which is swollen from domestic slaps, for a  new slap from Iraq, which might make him weep, after he has  begun to see how the world is gradually siding with Iraq and  opposing his criminal plans to annihilate the Iraqis.    Clinton: Drowned as you are in an ocean of crises and  scandals, pause for a while and consider your future. The Iraq  storm is coming, there is no question about it. You are  vulnerable, and can take no more slaps.</p>

According to our correspondent Pedro Manuel in  the Zambian capital, although the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] accepted the portfolios offered  by the government, the Black Cockerel's men want more. The  government in turn refuses to yield and points out that its  offer is not negotiable. Pedro Manuel reports.    The process continues at an impasse. The parties have not  yet reached an agreement in the country's administration.  Although it is being said that UNITA has accepted the  ministries of health, trade, tourism and hotel industry, a  source said that this does not change the present situation.  The government has offered UNITA these posts and although UNITA  has accepted them, it says they are not enough. UNITA also  wants to hold other ministries, the so-called [word indistinct]  ministries. The government continues to say no because its  offer is nonnegotiable.    It also seems as if UNITA wants to hold the Ministry of  Public Works and Urbanization, instead of the Construction  Materials Ministry. This issue could find an easy solution,  because both the Public Works Ministry and the Construction  Materials Ministry are part of the ministries offered by the  government. That is not all however [words indistinct].    On provincial governments, the situation continues  unchanged.  Apart from Uige, Lunda Sul, and Cuando Cubango which were  offered by the government, UNITA also demands the provincial  governments of Benguela, Huambo, and Bie. As if this was not  enough, UNITA also wants to administer more than 20 districts  and about 50 communes [words indistinct]. The government has  answered no. Now, the mediators are [words indistinct]. This  work began yesterday afternoon and continued this morning, but  no results have been obtained so far. The talks will be resumed  on 21 March.    Meanwhile, the government negotiating team returned to  Luanda  this afternoon for consultations with the president of the  Republic [words indistinct].</p>

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Mandela refuses to punish ANC offenders in human rights cases MR Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, yesterday refused to punish ANC officials found guilty by the organisation's commission of inquiry into murders, torture and other human rights abuses in ANC prison camps in the 1980s. The commission, which was appointed by Mr Mandela, last week called on the ANC to punish those involved in the deaths of 22 detainees, and other cases of abuse and injury, and to pay compensation to victims or their families. Mr Mandela rejected these recommendations, calling instead for a 'Truth Commission' to investigate all cases of human rights abuse, including those involving government officials. Mt Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC secretary general, drew a distinction between abuses carried out in defence of apartheid, and those committed in the fight for liberation. Asked whether the ANC believed that the ends justified the means in cases of human rights abuse, Mr Mandela replied: 'You can draw your own conclusions.' He said the ANC accepted 'collective responsibility' for what happened. He went on to excuse the abuses by saying that they were committed 'in an attempt to prevent violations of human rights by the other side'. Mr Mandela said any compensation to victims would have to be paid by a future government, not by the ANC. Meanwhile, he announced that Mr Thabo Mbeki, a leading moderate, had been elected national chairman of the ANC. This will boost Mr Mbeki's chances to succeed Mr Mandela as president. Mr Ramaphosa, another moderate, is the other possible successor, though he has come under increasing criticism for making too many concessions to whites.</p>

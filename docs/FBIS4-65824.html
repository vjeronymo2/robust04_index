			<p>BFN     [Text] There are unclear reports from New York about the  postponement of the UN secretary general's report to the  Security Council. Last night, UN alternate spokesman 'Ahmad  Fawzi said the report would be submitted by the end of the week  and clarified that the international organization has no  information that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas has  accepted the confidence-building measures [CBM's].    But the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation correspondent in New  York reported that according to UN Security Council circles,  after intervention by Turkish diplomats, the Turkish side has  been given a new extension until the end of May. According to  the same information, Inal Batu, the Turkish permanent  representative to the United Nations, sought a meeting with  Marrack Goulding, Alternate UN Secretary General, at which time  he conveyed a Turkish Government request that the report not be  submitted before 31 May. His justification was that the Turkish  Cypriot community is still holding meetings with Gustave  Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate special  representative in Cyprus. The Turkish representative also  claimed that Denktas informed Ankara of his decision to accept  the 21 March UN document on the CBM's but said he could not  announce it to Feissel before the extraordinary meetings of the  pseudogovernment and the pseudoparliament today and tomorrow  respectively.    According to our correspondent, UN Security Council circles  said the Turkish side was given the requested extension after it  was stressed that no new extension would be given. U.S.  officials said an extension would not be given even for the  so-called referendum that Denktas may attempt to hold.</p>

			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Deutsche Bank If ITT's sale of its financial services arm is in shareholders' interests, the reverse may be the case for Deutsche Bank, which is paying a net Dollars 900m for ITT Commercial Finance. True, Deutsche will be able to reap benefits from putting together its existing north American asset-based lending activities with those of the ITT subsidiary, and will gain access to thousands of new customers in north America and elsewhere in the world. But the bank will also have to write off substantial goodwill following the acquisition. No figure for this has been disclosed, but analysts put it at Dollars 700m. The acquisition adds Dollars 3.75bn of receivables to Deutsche's balance sheet, but the net effect of the deal will be an appreciable deterioration in the bank's core, tier one capital ratio. Other recent acquisitions, both in Germany and abroad, have also involved a large goodwill element. Given the bank's reluctance to sell the bulk of its industrial holdings, the danger is that Deutsche will be obliged to turn to shareholders to restore its capital base. Investors may be reluctant to contemplate this, as the strategy behind the acquisitions makes questionable sense. Recent purchases in Spain, Italy and now the US enhance the bank's position in these countries, but do not transform the bank's global competitiveness or its earnings power. The bank should consider pulling out of peripheral markets - especially in Spain and Italy - and concentrating its resources on developing a world-class investment banking operation.</p>

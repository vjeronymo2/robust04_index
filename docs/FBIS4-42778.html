			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Marco Taradash, chairman of the Italian </F> Broadcasting Oversight Committee, by Maurizio Ricci; place and  date not given: "How I Will Free Italy From the RAI" -- first  two paragraphs are LA REPUBBLICA introduction]    [Text] Rome -- The RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation]  stands with respect to the system of party domination as the  Republic of Salo stood with respect to the Fascist regime. "We  freed ourselves from the latter, now we must free ourselves from  the former." Marco Taradash has become the first chairman of  the RAI Oversight Committee of the Second Republic and has a  specific plan in mind: radical reform of public broadcasting as  the precondition for any discussion of a reorganization of the  Italian television system. A representative of Pannella's  "reformers" group, ready to proudly declare his membership of  the liberal Left, though elected on Forza Italia's lists ("There  is a Right that is democratic to a greater or lesser extent, but  that in any case behaves democratically now. On the other hand,  there are the post-Christian Democrats and the  post-Communists"), Taradash has always been accustomed to  controversy and is not frightened by the polemic sparked by his  initiative to report the spoils system within the RAI to the  legal authorities. Nor is he frightened by the reserve with  which his move was received by the majority to which he belongs.    "Who says Berlusconi has distanced himself from it? Whoever  says so is committing journalistic libel, displaying a lack of  professionalism and correctness. Anyone who knows about  terrorism knows that the people who distance themselves are  those who, having done something together with others,  subsequently change their minds and say: I will never do it  again."    [Ricci] What about Berlusconi?    [Taradash] Berlusconi knew nothing about it, and there was  no  reason to involve the prime minister in this matter. Indeed, he  merely said that he knew nothing about it, that he did not  criticize it, and admitted that it was a personal initiative on  my part, meaning that it was an initiative of the reformers'  political movement. That is all there is to it.    [Ricci] So are all these reservations expressed by forces  which, after all, belong to the same majority, not part of the  atmosphere of ill feeling that exists at present between you and  the Berlusconi government?    [Taradash] I am doing what I have always done. Already two  weeks ago I condemned the prejudiced and discriminatory attitude  that Fininvest adopted, especially toward the smaller lists, in  the European election campaign. I think that Fininvest has the  duties of a public service, even though these are not envisioned  by the law.    [Ricci] Do you not think that your institutional role as  chairman of the Oversight Committee limits your flexibility,  your ability "to do what you have always done"?    [Taradash] I prefer to say that it liberates. I presented  the judiciary with documents concerning the past, in order to  avert a vast whitewash in connection with the RAI's domination  by the parties. This has nothing to do with the future work of  the committee, which is what concerns me since I became  chairman. I see no conflict here.    [Ricci] Who is under investigation in the RAI? The Justice  Ministry has not confirmed any names.    [Taradash] If anyone asks me whether they are under  investigation, I have always said, I do not know. But  journalists have always stated the opposite.    [Ricci] Nevertheless, [RAI Chairman] Dematte and the other  "professors" of the RAI top management seem convinced that you  do not have your sights set on them, as you do on previous  administrations.    [Taradash] That is true. I have no issue with them. The  problem is that when the system of party domination collapsed,  the regime entrenched itself within the RAI. I suspect that  even the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] eventually allowed  itself to become involved in a system of party domination  entirely internal to the RAI, even when this system of party  domination no longer existed outside. Consider the fact that  such people as Dematte and [RAI Managing Director] Locatelli,  who have backgrounds as in academia or journalism: They have  been destroyed. Or involved in a kind of Stockholm syndrome --  the psychological link created between a bank robber and his  hostage.    [Ricci] So is their time over?    [Taradash] I am not interested in manhunts, which some  people  on the Left, however, would like very much. I want a war to  liberate the RAI from this regime. The Salo Republic, too, must  be liberated.    [Ricci] How?    [Taradash] I cannot reveal my plan for the Oversight  Committee because that would be unfair to the other Committee  members. What I can say, is what I think its objective should  be: Managers, producers, officials, and journalists must be  chosen on the basis of criteria of efficiency, productivity, and  professional skills. This is the way to end the Salo Republic  and to enter the democratic republic.    [Ricci] How can those appointed according to the spoils  system be identified?    [Taradash] It is enough to turn on the radio or television  to  see whether or not this applies to a particular producer.    [Ricci] But the issue here is not the assessment of the  average listener. I want to know what the Oversight Committee  will do: Will it pass judgment on individual programs, say  which are subject to the spoils system and which are not?    [Taradash] Thank heavens, the Committee has neither the  legal  nor the administrative powers to do this. The Committee will  assess broadcasts to the extent that it can. The Committee can  adopt a political stance. Then it is up to the government, the  judiciary, the IRI [Institute of Industrial Reconstruction], the  management board, the director general, or the director of the  individual program to act.    [Ricci] How is this "liberation" of the RAI connected with  containing Fininvest's hegemony, the issue of efficient  antitrust legislation with regard to the media?    [Taradash] The two things are connected chronologically,  though the RAI is a public broadcaster and has different  problems from private broadcasters. The building of a  commercial RAI network, that is, with commercials, means that  the commercial competitor that is being established must have  the same dimensions and that we cannot now consider reducing  Fininvest's strength without first taking action on the RAI.    [Ricci] Would such action extend as far as shielding it in  terms of advertsing?    [Taradash] Definitely not. Advertising distorts public  broadcasting. Furthermore, only if the RAI does not compete in  the advertising market will the resources be made available that  will ensure that an antitrust authority will not penalize firms  capable of being active at the international level and that will  favor the growth of new alignments. If on top of this we add  new technologies -- cable and satellite -- which are not so new  abroad and which must be made available to both new and old  users, the problem of monopoly and duopoly will acquire a  completely different aspect.    [Ricci] Do you mean that these three steps -- reform of the  RAI and its advertising, the introduction of new technologies,  and the formation of new alignments -- are dependent on one  another and that the technological revolution cannot be carried  out unless the RAI is reformed and reduced and that antitrust  legislation cannot be implemented unless the other two steps  have been carried out?    [Taradash] We could draft antitrust legislation even now and  say that it takes effective in six monthse or in two years,  depending on the fulfillment of the other two conditions.</p>

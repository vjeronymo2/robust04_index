			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Record rise in cable services THE cable television industry has enjoyeda record period of growth, the Independent Television Commission said yesterday. In the three months to October, 49,667 new subscribers were connected, bringing the total in the previous 12 months to 159,569. Both figures were records. The quarterly ITC figures show that the total number of subscribers to modern multi-channel cable systems rose to 380,297 with cable operators, mainly North American, accelerating their building of cable networks. Cable services are available to 1.75m homes. The penetration rate - the proportion of those who subscribe out of those who could do so - is 21.7 per cent, an increase of 2.8 percentage points over the year. The ITC believes the cable audience exceeds 1.2m. The most striking growth was in cable companies offering telephone services as well as television. Of the 57 operating franchises, 21 are offering a telephone service, almost all in competition with British Telecom. In the year to October, the number of telephone lines installed by cable companies rose from 11,903 to 72,681. Sir George Russell, chairman of the ITC, said earlier this week that by the end of the year investment in cable would exceed Pounds 1bn. The ITC chairman also quoted Saatchi &amp; Saatchi forecasts that by the turn of the century 7.6m people would be receiving cable services and that 70 per cent of the country would be covered.</p>

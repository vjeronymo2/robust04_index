			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Survey of Tyne and Wear (5): A powerful magnet - Tyneside NEWCASTLE comes as a surprise to many first-time visitors. Primed to expect - depending to their preconceptions - pit heaps, grime, a concrete jungle or men in mufflers and flat caps, many are taken aback at the city's handsome central conservation area, its fine shops and dozens of restaurants. Newcastle, unlike so many British urban centres which die after 6pm, has retained a grip on its populace's thirst for leisure and entertainment, whether than means eight pints of lager and a kebab or a night at the opera. Regional capital of the north-east, its facilities are a powerful magnet for Tyneside's 832,000 population. How else could a city with fewer than 300,000 residents, 12.9 per cent of them unemployed, possibly support in its centre alone more than 100 restaurants, 60 pubs and nightclubs, three department stores, hundreds of shops and a plethora of theatres, cinemas, museums and other cultural facilities? The Royal Shakespeare Company's annual visits to its 'third home' and performances by the city's resident Northern Sinfonia and visiting orchestras, draw people in from a very wide area. The Theatre Royal, beautifully refurbished at a cost of Pounds 9.3m, and the restored Tyne Theatre, which has Victorian understage machinery of interest to theatre historians worldwide, are both held in great affection and regard. The same cannot be said of the City Hall, the main concert venue, long criticised for its lack of atmosphere and size - it is inadequate for blockbuster events. To test the commercial scope for a new concert venue, an expert study funded by the TWDC, the city council, the Department of the Environment and the Northumbria and English tourist boards began last month. Tyneside's two giant retail centres - Eldon Square, Europe's largest city centre shopping complex in Newcastle, and the MetroCentre, Europe's largest out-of-town shopping and leisure complex in Gateshead - maintain a friendly rivalry, co-operating in wooing big-spending Scandinavians and competing in the home market. Both had very good Christmases and are sounding bullish even now. Secondary shopping streets and areas are, however, finding the competition difficult and are tending to shift downmarket. But Newcastle is about to have an injection of yet more top quality shopping space at its very heart; the new neo-classical Monument Mall will open this spring. Although the city has responded swiftly to any threat to its supremacy - the MetroCentre's multiscreen cinema was promptly countered by a similar development in Newcastle and Eldon Square has been extended since the MetroCentre opened - it has been unable to combat the shrinkage of its manufacturing sector. Manufacturing employment declined from 28 per cent in 1981 to 17 per cent in 1989, with a corresponding rise in the service sector; about 20,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost in the city in the past 20 years. The latest cut is at Anglo Great Lakes' graphite electrode plant, closing this summer with the loss of 230 jobs. Some argue that all this is an inevitable feature of international employment trends; that the remaining big manufacturers, by dint of investment, are offering high quality jobs with prospects; that in an age of mobility Newcastle should embrace a service, small business and high-tech industry future, built partly on its strong academic sector, and not worry too much if some residents work elsewhere in Tyne and Wear. But the city's failure to attract any of the north-east's Japanese manufacturing investments has underlined its lack of large development sites. To remedy this, the city council's unitary development plan controversially proposes the release of 1,222 hectares from the green belt near Newcastle airport and the new Western Bypass. The land would be available for business and industry, recreation and 3,000 homes. Gateshead has fared better in land availability, thanks to its large Team Valley Estate. The public developer English Estates, headquartered here, is carrying out developments in various locations in Tyne and Wear to help diversify its economic base. Some are high-tech, others more conventional such as its new factory development at Walker Riverside in Newcastle. Much of the former Gateshead garden festival site is destined for housing or recreation but near the river Sir Robert McAlpine is to develop Tyne Park, comprising office and high-tech space. Agents Storey Sons and Parker have no firm lettings yet but say they are not disappointed with the level of interest. They remain convinced there is potential on Tyneside for more modern, high quality office space and for rental growth from the present Pounds 13.50 per sq ft maximum. Storey Sons and Parker itself made news last year when six partners bought the business from Lloyds. Headquartered in Newcastle, with other offices in Yorkshire and the north-west, it claims to be the north of England's largest firm of commercial-sector chartered property surveyors. The firm notes that several leading hotel groups have, against the national trend, been inquiring about development sites in Tyneside, even though several new hotels, including the four-star Copthorne on Newcastle Quayside and the Friendly Hotel at Boldon Business Park, South Tyneside, have opened recently. Other occupants of the Boldon park include Japanese car trim manufacturer Hashimoto, a Nissan supplier. Work also starts this summer on a new hotel near the river mouth in South Shields. It will be ready in time for next year's Tall Ships Race. The last race, in 1986, stirred deep affections for the River Tyne. Since then its riversides have been much rejuvenated. The 1993 event should be one to remember.</p>

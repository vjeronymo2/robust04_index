			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Management: Support for Aids project Picture the scene: a jack collapses in a repair workshop, a mechanic is trapped under a car and there is blood everywhere. The mechanic is known to be gay. No-one wants to touch him in case he has got it - Aids. The first-aid kit cannot be found and the victim screams for help while his workmates freeze in horror and indecision. This chilling sequence of events - played by actors in this instance, but only too plausible - comes from a training video from the Terrence Higgins Trust, in partnership with a group of blue-chip employers. Companies which have given their backing to the training project include IBM, Marks and Spencer, Unilever, Kingfisher and WH Smith. The project has also published a training manual and briefing notes, covering basic medical information, recruitment issues, confidentiality, pensions, first aid and travel abroad. Separately, the Society of Occupational Medicine has also produced a booklet which covers some of the same ground and serves as a good introduction to the subject. European companies have been slower than their US counterparts to draw up policies covering HIV and Aids and educate their workforces. A degree of complacency, even, has crept in. This latest batch of training material will help to reawaken interest in the issue. HIV and Aids: Positive Management. Complete training package Pounds 149 plus VAT. Briefing notes available separately Pounds 5. From: The Sales Unit, The Industrial Society, 49 Calthorpe Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 1TH. Tel: 021 454 6769. What employers should know about HIV and Aids. Available free (send a large SAE, 74p postage) from: The Society of Occupational Medicine, 6 St Andrews Place, London NW1 4LE</p>

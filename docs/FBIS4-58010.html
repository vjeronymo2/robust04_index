			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 27 May (AFP) -- Today, Dominican  Deputy Foreign Minister Fabio Herrera said deposed President  Jean-Bertrand Aristide should resign to facilitate a negotiated  solution to the Haitian crisis. Herrera said he does not  believe that stepping up the embargo or resorting to military  intervention to force Aristide's return are solutions for the  neighboring country.    "I believe the solution will be for the military to leave  power and for Aristide to resign, thereby making way for a  provisional government and, in turn, general elections," Herrera  said in a domestic television interview. According to Herrera,  if the Haitian military is crushed by way of a military  intervention, then Aristide would have to rule with a government  guarded by foreign troops.    The Dominican deputy foreign minister, who is considered an  expert on Haiti, reiterated his disagreement with the embargo  because Haiti "has become a huge concentration camp." Herrera  also said that it was "impossible" for the Dominican Republic to  prevent contraband fuel from trickling into Haiti "because we  have 300 km of border which is very difficult to patrol."    Herrera also rejected the idea presented by Western powers  that Haitian refugee camps be set up in Dominican Republic.  This topic, as well as the issue of border patrols, was  discussed with President Joaquin Balaguer by President Bill  Clinton's special envoy William Grey on Wednesday night in Santo  Domingo. Following the meeting, Balaguer announced that he  "would seal" the border.    According to information received today, Balaguer met  yesterday afternoon with the Armed Forces High Command to  instruct them to redouble border vigilance. According to Army  sources, more than 10,000 soldiers are deployed in the  impoverished border region to prevent contraband and Haitians  crossing into the Dominican Republic.    Armed Forces Secretary General Constantino Matos told the  press that "we are conducting strenuous and honest work" along  the border in an effort to comply with UN decisions.  Nevertheless, he admitted, "it is possible that some gasoline  is still being shipped" into Haiti, but "not with the consent of  the Armed Forces." Matos also announced that border troops will  soon be relieved by fresh troops, and he gave assurances that if  officers or soldiers are found to have permitted contraband to  cross the border into Haiti, they will be severely punished.    [In a related 210-word, Santo Domingo-dateline report, Paris  AFP in Spanish at 1335 GMT on 27 May notes, "The presence of  Haitians in the commercial sector of downtown Santo Domingo,  where they secure supplies to meet demands for various goods in  their country, has been reduced to a minimum." The report adds:  "A similar drop in the presence of Haitians was noticed in the  border province of Pedernales, 350 km south of Santo Domingo.  According to reports from the border region, many Haitians are  gathering along a small river on the border, waiting to  establish contact with Dominicans wanting to sell them food."]</p>

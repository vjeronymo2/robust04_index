			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Income): Ten simple rules you should watch There are 10 simple rules to remember when checking out an investment: The higher the income, the more you should investigate the security of the investment. If it looks too good to be true, it probably is. Beware, in particular, of high-income guarantees from small banks and finance houses - they may not be secure. The higher the income, the less chance of capital appreciation. Can you afford to take a high income at the expense of long-term growth? Does the product use part of your capital to maintain the income if returns are lower than expected? Over the past 30 years, the value of income from equities has, on average, doubled every seven years. Other things being equal, the capital value of a well-chosen unit trust, investment trust or portfolio of shares should increase - although not necessarily at the same rate. But remember that, with these investments, the income and capital value will fluctuate. Check thoroughly any strings attached to high-guaranteed income rates from building societies. The rate might be fixed for just a few months before falling below standard rates. Deposit rates from the major banks are not competitive at present but, if base rates rise, the banks tend to respond more quickly than building societies. Check the underlying investments of any collective vehicle that offers a very high income - income unit trusts, for one. It might be invested in companies about to cut dividends; rely on futures and options to boost the yield; or take management costs out of capital rather than income. Some investments, such as the income shares of split level investment trusts, offer what appears to be an outstandingly high income but will pay back little or nothing of your original capital. This is not a market for novices. Examine the assumptions used by high-income bonds. Some promise to return your capital only if the underlying investments increase by, say, 10 per cent a year. Tax-efficiency is important. First, make good use of your tax allowances (see table). Second, invest (where possible) through a tax-efficient vehicle  -say, a personal pension or personal equity plan - but do watch for high charges that can eliminate any tax advantages. The over-riding consideration is performance and the likely rate of return after charges and tax. Remember that tax treatment of different investment vehicles can change, as can your personal tax circumstances. Review your portfolio regularly and consider a spread of investment vehicles. Note the difference between an investment which guarantees to return your money at a particular future date, such as a gilt or bond held to maturity, and one which returns your money on demand, such as a traditional bank or building society account. Gilts and bonds involve considerable market risk while you hold them. Always seek independent advice and check how the adviser is paid. If commission-based, will the adviser still recommend nil-commission products such as National Savings? Should you be looking at income investments at all? Sophisticated investors argue that income-seekers often would do better to aim for capital growth instead. When they need income, they can simply cash in some profits to make use of their tax-free Pounds 5,800 annual capital gains exemption. Some investments offering good total returns but little or no true income, such as zero coupon bonds, can be included in portfolios structured in a way which allows them to provide a regular flow of profits as quasi-income. But this approach will appeal only to investors who can afford to take a long-term view, have a high risk tolerance, and are either unusually numerate or have a very reliable financial adviser.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Tax facts for income investors  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Allowances                     Pounds  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Personal allowance              3,445 Age 65-74*                      4,200 Age 75 and over*                4,370 Married cpl's allow.**          1,720 Age 65-74**                     2,665 Age 75 and over**               2,705  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Income tax rates               Pounds  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Lower rate 20%            First 3,000 Basic rate 25%           3,001-23,700 Higher rate 40%           Over 23,700  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Capital gains tax              Pounds  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Annual exemption                5,800 Thereafter          Your highest rate  --------------------------------------------------------------------- *Age related allowance reduced by Pounds 1 for every Pounds 2 additional income over Pounds 14,200. ** Relief restricted to 20%.

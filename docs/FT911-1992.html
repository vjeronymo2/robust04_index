			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Big sugar crop unlikely to lift Brazilian exports BRAZIL is expecting a bumper sugar crop this year, but market sources say excess production is unlikely to result in higher exports. The Association of Sugar and Alcohol Industries of Sao Paulo (AIAA) has forecast a 9 per cent rise in sugar output this year compared to the harvest of 1990-91, one of the worst years on record. According to the association Brazil's next sugar harvest will produce 158m bags. The rise will occur due to improved productivity, rather than any increase in area planted. Most of the excess production will come from the central-south area of the country. Exporters believe the association's forecast is accurate. Mr Mauricio Fernandes, president of the sugar exporter Magman Comercio Internacional, said: 'All our preliminary analyses point to an increase of about 10 per cent in sugar output this year.' Observers believe, however, rising demand for sugar-derived alcohol market will continue to put a lid on exports. Those shortages might get worse, analysts say. During the Gulf war sales of cars run on alcohol surged, and the Brazilian government has said it will be reluctant to release sugar for export in the face of insufficient supply at home. Mr Luiz Bertelli, superintendent of the AIAA, said: 'A rise in sugar production only means that the Sao Paulo area may become self-sufficient this year, reducing the region's need to import sugar from the north-east.' The United States has agreed to abolish the countervailing duty on the importation of frozen orange juice concentrate from Brazil. According to orange producers here, the move is an important concession in the battle to eradicate import barriers on orange juice from Brazil.</p>

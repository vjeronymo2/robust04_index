			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITIES OFFERING BARGAIN PRICES TO AUTO DEALERS;  </P> <P> TAXES: CAR DEALERSHIPS GENERATE SUBSTANTIAL SALES TAX REVENUES. AND SOME SAN  GABRIEL VALLEY CITIES ARE CUTTING DEALS TO FILL THEIR NEW AUTO MALLS.  </P> <P> Like a star high school quarterback among throngs of hungry college recruiters,  the auto dealer has become the darling of many revenue-hungry San Gabriel  Valley city officials in the last decade.  </P> <P> And in recent months, the mall skirmishes have become mall wars, as some  officials offer increasingly sweet deals to lure dealers -- and their precious  sales taxes -- to their respective cities, and others scramble to keep their  established dealerships.  </P> <P> "(Auto dealers) generate more sales tax per square foot of land than any other  business a city can attract," explains Rob Steel, redevelopment director in  Azusa. "That's why cities are fighting each other for them."  </P> <P> But the zeal to retain and attract dealerships has sparked debate about the use  of public funds to boost private enterprise, as well as exacting an emotional  and financial cost to businessmen and homeowners who lie in the path of  redevelopment and eminent domain. And some critics suggest that dealers are  playing on cities' fears in order to win better deals.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, city officials forge on. Three new auto dealers will begin  construction at the Glendora Auto Center along the Foothill Freeway this month,  breaking ground on a 32-acre complex that will become the newest car-shopper's  paradise in the San Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P> Eight dealerships will buy the land from the redevelopment agency for  essentially 50% of its value. In return, the city gets at least $1 million a  year in expected new tax revenue once the mall is completed.  </P> <P> The city manager called the project one of the council's most important and  positive moves in the city's history. But critics have blasted it as a  "sweetheart deal" that is setting back the city $13 million.  </P> <P> Pomona is offering land valued at $6 per square foot for between $1.50 and  $2.50 per square foot at a 57-acre auto center to be built north of the Pomona  Freeway. Monrovia and Duarte had been selling land for their adjoining  18-dealer, 47-acre 210 Freeway Autoplex, scheduled for completion next year,  from as low as $7 per square foot.  </P> <P> In Pasadena, where six dealers have left the city in the last two years, the  average cost of commercial land is $30 a square foot. Desperate to keep its  remaining 16 dealerships from deserting, Pasadena is considering offering  dealers rebates of up to 50% of the sales tax that would be due to the city  should the dealers decide to build or expand.  </P> <P> Alhambra -- whose 20 auto dealers are projected to generate $2.1 million in  sales tax in the 1989-90 fiscal year -- has helped dealers on leased land  purchase sites so they don't have to deal with skyrocketing real estate costs.  And last month, Covina, which has lost two dealerships to a mall in neighboring  West Covina, condemned a retail center to acquire land for up to two new  dealerships.  </P> <P> "They won't pay more than $5 per square foot for land valued at $10 to $20 per  square foot, and cities are happy to offer them that," Covina Planner Hal  Ledford said.  </P> <P> Leonard Eliot, assistant exececutive director of West Covina's redevelopment  agency, said the dealerships are attractive because they are "large ticket  items."  </P> <P> "Cities are generally looking for revenue, and sales tax is one item we have  the greatest amount of control over," he said.  </P> <P> City officials say that since the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, cities  have been forced to turn to sales taxes rather than property taxes as a steady  source of general fund revenue. The landmark measure slashed property taxes to  1% of a parcel's value and restricted increases in assessments to 2% annually.  </P> <P> Ever since the success of the Cerritos Auto Center -- which opened in 1980 and  was one of the first in the Los Angeles area -- the malls have tempted city  officials, said Mike Martin, redevelopment director of Alhambra.  </P> <P> "It also showed the impact on surrounding cities like Downey and South Gate,"  which had to fight to retain their dealers, he said. "That's a real sobering  thought. The cities that have been able to respond will come out on top."  </P> <P> Alhambra City Manager Kevin Murphy said several dealers in the city "came to us  in '84, '85 planning to move out of town unless we helped them." The city  decided then to develop an 18-dealership mall along Main Street. The project  should be 90% complete within two years, Martin said.  </P> <P> Although most officials maintain that competition for dealers is friendly, they  admit they hate to see one leave.  </P> <P> "Conflict has arisen when a city successfully gets an auto franchise from an  adjoining city," Eliot said. "That has caused some bad feeling between some  cities sometimes."  </P> <P> But certain officials say they think cities are letting dealers take advantage  of them.  </P> <P> Glendora Councilman David Bodley, who voted against the Glendora mall last  November, charged that dealers are exploiting cities by shopping around for the  best deals.  </P> <P> "They're very good businessmen, and they are using all of the fears of all of  the cities about revenue, or the lack of it, to get the best deal," he said.  </P> <P> "As dealerships become more sophisticated in realizing how great an asset they  are to cities, they begin playing cities off against each other," said West  Covina's Eliot.  </P> <P> "One dealer (approached by Glendora) wants us to buy property for them to  expand," he said. "We're looking into it."  </P> <P> Warren Person, a West Covina Oldsmobile dealer who is asking the city to help  him acquire 40,000 square feet for expansion, said he has to do what is in the  best interest for his company.  </P> <P> "I'm in a redevelopment district, and obviously they don't want me to move to  Glendora," he said, adding that he would prefer to remain loyal to West Covina.  </P> <P> Chester Yoshizaki, West Covina's redevelopment manager, said the whole point of  his agency was to help existing businesses.  </P> <P> "We automatically respond any way we can," Yoshizaki said. "Everything we can  do to keep them here would be to our benefit."  </P> <P> West Covina collected $1.7 million in sales tax from auto dealers in 1988-89.  Of the city's 12 dealerships, nine are in the 18-acre West Covina Auto Plaza  along the San Bernardino Freeway completed in 1986.  </P> <P> Some city officials complain that dealers will sometimes use the threat of  leaving as a bargaining chip to get concessions from redevelopment agencies.  </P> <P> "These guys are car salesmen; they can negotiate," said Martin, referring to  Alhambra dealers who "will hint to make you understand there is cheaper land  elsewhere in the world."  </P> <P> Ledford said this encourages cities to "steal businesses from one another. It  results in cities competing and giving money to businesses, instead of services  to people."  </P> <P> Eliot warned: "It's estructive for cities to upbid each other. It's going to  cost them more and more."  </P> <P> Because the creation of almost every mall is organized by a redevelopment  agency, another complaint arises when the power of eminent domain is sometimes  exercised in assembling land.  </P> <P> "You can't put a price tag on people," said Sherry Passmore, a slow-growth  advocate who has served as a consultant to residents fighting condemnation. "It  adds insult to injury when you find it's for a businessman."  </P> <P> Christina Lizardo, whose 9,000-square-foot lot was taken by eminent domain for  the mall in Duarte, took the case to court and finally settled with the city in  July.  </P> <P> "It was very stressful trying to find a house when I hadn't planned to sell in  the first place," she said. "If the school or freeway was expanding and they  had to take homes, it would have been a lot easier for us to swallow."  </P> <P> No homes were taken for the Glendora center, but a slow-growth group, Glendora  Pride, objected to the project. "We're opposed to the use of public funds for  private enterprise," said association president Judy Lawford.  </P> <P> Darlene Avina, a past president of the group, called the arrangement with the  dealers a "sweetheart deal." She pointed out that the redevelopment agency has  already helped one of the dealers acquire his existing site.  </P> <P> Glendora Finance Director Larry Shroeder said Fred and Carl Colley, who jointly  own Ford, Volkswagen and Subaru dealerships in the city, owe the redevelopment  agency $2.8 million for land the agency purchased for them in 1983. They have  until 2008 to repay the debt.  </P> <P> The Colleys already have "a low-interest loan from us, and now (they're) coming  back and getting more. Why is the city helping them get rich?"  </P> <P> Dealers contend that finding a good location is a matter of survival and that  land prices make help from cities almost essential.  </P> <P> "Dealers that don't get onto freeway locations will find it very difficult to  survive," said Carl Colley, who was negotiating to move to San Dimas when  Glendora approved its mall. The Colleys will relocate to the freeway mall next  year.  </P> <P> Pasadena Motorcar Dealers Assn. president Charles Pachdjian , will be moving  his Oldsmobile dealership to the Monrovia mall next summer.  </P> <P> "As these malls go in, it's got to hurt dealers in towns like Pasadena that  don't have one," he said. "Every dealer in this town would move out" if there  weren't similar franchises already at the malls, he said. He hopes the freeway  exposure will increase his annual sales from $15 million to $20 million.  </P> <P> Duarte, which expects $2 million to $3 million in additional sales taxes from  the 10 dealerships on its share of the mall, expects to recoup the $7.5 million  it spent to create the package within 14 years.  </P> <P> "The key is to be conservative on sales tax projections. That will help even  out those peaks and valleys in the industry," said City Manager Jesse Duff. But  no matter how careful the analysis and planning, he said, "you always have a  concern about giving away too much."  </P> <P> HOW CITIES LURE AUTO DEALERS  </P> <P> Alhambra Helped existing Main Street dealers upgrade and relocated others to  that street to create an 18-dealership strip. Also helped dealers purchase land  so they wouldn't have to continue leasing.  </P> <P> Claremont;Assembled and sold land with no discount for a seven-dealership auto  park that opened in 1986.  </P> <P> Covina;Condemned retail center last month to create space for up to two new  auto dealerships on Citrus Avenue and intends to help two other dealers upgrade  and expand.  </P> <P> Glendora;Looking for dealers to fill two remaining slots in its  eight-dealership mall along Foothill Freeway. The city is asking for about 50%  of the land value as down payment. The remainder will be forgiven if the dealer  generates the equivalent in sales tax over the next 10 years. Groundbreaking  for the first three dealerships began this month.  </P> <P> Monrovia-Duarte;Sold dealers land for $6 to $15 per square foot, depending on  when dealers signed up for a space at their 18-dealership 210 Freeway Autoplex,  to be completed in 1990.  </P> <P> Pasadena;Considering sales tax rebate to dealers who want to build or expand.  </P> <P> Pomona;Asking for $1.50 to $2.50 per square foot for spaces in a  nine-dealership mall along the Pomona Freeway. Three dealers have already  agreed to move in.  </P> <P> West Covina;Opened a nine-dealership mall along the San Bernardino Freeway in  1986 and is considering helping a dealer outside the mall expand.  </P></p>

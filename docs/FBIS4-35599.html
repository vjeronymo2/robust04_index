			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] President 'Umar al-Bashir returned to Khartoum  from Vienna yesterday afternoon [31 May] at the end of a two-day  visit to Austria at the invitation of President Thomas Kestil.  In his arrival speech, General al-Bashir said he held several  meetings in Vienna with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni. At  some of these meetings, which were behind closed doors, the two  leaders discussed the development of bilateral relations.  According to President al-Bashir, these meetings were aimed at  improving relations between the two countries, given Uganda's  important role in the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and  Development initiative on restoring peace to southern Sudan. He  said the two sides agreed to strengthen ties to serve the  interests of both peoples. [passage omitted]</p>

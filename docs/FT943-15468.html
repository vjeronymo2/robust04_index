			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Spain to defy Brussels over UK ferry row The Spanish government yesterday signalled its intention to defy a formal complaint from the European Commission by refusing to grant a British ferry line access to its most commercially appealing southern ports. Officials said yesterday in Madrid that Cenargo, the British ferry company, would shortly receive permission to start services between Nador in Morocco and a single Spanish port, most probably Alicante. But in a case being dubbed the Orly Airport of shipping, this solution will satisfy neither the Commission, Cenargo nor the British government as Alicante is furthest away from Nador of the three ports on Spain's Mediterranean coast. The closest ports - Almeria and Malaga - remain closed to the British line. The case has been compared with the much publicised British Airways dispute with France over access to Orly airport in France. Spain's partial climbdown, after some two years of obstruction, follows a complaint from Brussels that Madrid has disobeyed the rules and spirit of the European Union's single market by denying Cenargo access to Spanish ports. The official letter from the commission to the Spanish Foreign Ministry, sent at the beginning of June, states that the Spanish are directly contravening EU legislation that allows shipping lines to operate services between any member state and another non-EU country. The letter suggests that neither the commission nor its legal services will accept the Spanish government's solution. The letter implies that Cenargo ought to have been allowed to chose to operate from any of the three southern ports. Cenargo said yesterday that although it would accept the offer of Alicante, it would continue to push for access to Almeria and Malaga. 'The government has opened a window but not the door,' Mr Armando Ligerri, Cernargo's chief executive in Spain said yesterday. The Department of Transport in the UK said it would support Cenargo. Spain's authorities should have replied to the Commission complaint last week but they have now been granted an extension until the end of the month to rectify formally their ban on Cernago. Although there is an intermittent ferry service between Alicante and Oran, in Algeria, there has never been one with Morocco and this eastern Spanish port which - unlike Malaga and Almeria, which lie further south - lacks an established Moroccan client base. Mr Ligerri said Cenargo did not have an office in Alicante although it did have one in Almeria. By operating out of Alicante, with a sailing time from Nador of some 13 hours, against six hours out of Almeria, Cenargo is in effect barred from establishing a daily return service to Morocco with a single vessel. Cernargo had originally hoped to establish an Almeria-Nador link early last year but its ferry's maiden voyage was aborted by the Spanish navy, which prevented it docking at Almeria. The UK company, which says it will be unable to start up out of Alicante until November, is claiming Pta2.1bn (Pounds 10.4m) from the Madrid authorities in compensation for lost business.</p>

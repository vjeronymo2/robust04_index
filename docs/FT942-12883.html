			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Sao Paulo up 2.08% in nervous trading Brazil Stock prices ended up 2.08 per cent in nervous trading on the Sao Paulo stock exchange, hurt by signs that Congress will make no further progress on the constitutional reform process. The Bovespa index of 56 most-traded shares ended at 15,839 points, up 323 on the day. Volume was moderate at CR258bn(Dollars 209). In Rio de Janeiro the ISENN index slipped 1.6 per cent to end at 60,295 points. Brazilian congressional party leaders failed to agree on an eleventh-hour accord to save the long-stalled constitutional revision. Mexico Equities ended strongly in late trading to close with a big gain in expectation of a drop in interest rates and news of an Dollars 8bn swap facility between the US, Canada and Mexico. The key IPC index rose by 93.05 points, or 4.25 per cent, at 2,284.13 on a volume of 100.3m shares. The bolsa was up 49.15 points at midday but - off earlier highs - closed with heavy buying. Announcement of the swap facility raised hopes that interest rates would fall in coming weeks. Some analysts predict that rates for 28-day treasury bills, or Cetes, will drop by as much as a percentage point in this week's auction. The swap facility proved an immediate tonic as the peso gained 0.018 new pesos against the dollar. Advancing issues oputnumbered decliners 70-12 with Ggante B leading the way with a 13.51 per cent gain. The rise was seen as a 'normal correction' after the stock's sharp fall on Monday after the kidnapping of the company's vice-chairman.</p>

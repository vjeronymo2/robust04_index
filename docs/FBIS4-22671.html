			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Valdis Francs: "New Director of Citizenship and </F> Immigration Department Appointed"]    [Text] Riga, March 8. Today, the Cabinet of Ministers of  the Republic of Latvia appointed Ints Zitars, former head of the  information center of the Citizenship and Immigration Department  (CID), as director of the CID.    I. Zitars, in his former position, has shown himself to be  an  able organizer. An important prerequisite was that the new  department chief should come from this very department, and thus  be familiar with its major problems, according to Normunds  Belskis, Press Secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, as  told to DIENA.    Since the removal from office of the former department  chief,  Maris Plavnieks, the department was being run by his deputy,  Peteris Zviedris.    Ints Zitars was born in 1944, and is Latvian. He graduated  from the Department of Physics and Mathematics of the University  of Latvia in 1970. From 1970 to 1978, he worked in the  experimental semi-conductor laboratory in the University of  Latvia as junior scientific associate. From 1978 to 1992, he was  at the Solid-State Physics Institute of the University of Latvia  as junior scientific associate, then senior engineer. From 1992  until his appointment as director of the CID, he worked as the  head of the CID information center.    Photo caption: CID director: Ints Zitars. Photo by Vitalijs  Stipnieks, A.F.I.</p>

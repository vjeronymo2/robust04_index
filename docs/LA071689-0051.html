			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL FORMULAS TARGET PESTS  </P> <P> Just when everything seems to be going along so well, those pesky garden pests  show up and begin to consume the bountiful meal in your garden.  </P> <P> You can usually control them in one of several ways: by physically removing  them, by bringing in other insects that are their natural enemies or by using a  packaged product containing active ingredients to kill the pest.  </P> <P> Caterpillars, budworms and other critters can be handled very nicely by the use  of one of the bacillus thuringiensis products. This is not a chemical; rather  it is a bacteria which, when eaten by the unsuspecting worm, causes one last  stomach ache.  </P> <P> Ants are also having a field day now. Silica gel compound is a very safe  product that is neither a chemical nor a germ. It causes an insect's feet to  stick together -- so it also works on silverfish and other creepy crawlers.  </P> <P> You can also find very finely ground products that will take care of all of  these monsters as well as snails and slugs. Be sure to use any product  according to the instructions on the label.  </P> <P> Most products have a very short life span once exposed to the sun or air.  Although it can limit the overall effectiveness of the product, they're made  that way for our safety.  </P></p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 10m law suit fears hit Lloyd Thompson Shares in Lloyd Thompson, the insurance and reinsurance broker, fell 16p to 176p yesterday after the company warned that its principal subsidiary was expected to be named as defendant in a Pounds 10m law suit. Commercial Union, the composite insurer, is understood to be planning legal proceedings following a dispute over a marine insurance policy arranged via Lloyd Thompson. CU, which today announces its results for the first nine months of this year, would not comment last night. Lloyd Thompson said it would 'vigorously resist' any claim. The group said in a statement that the proceedings had arisen 'in the ordinary course of business' of its main broking business. The statement added: 'Such proceedings could, if instituted, give rise to a claim of approximately Pounds 10m.' Lloyd Thompson has had to weather difficult trading conditions over the past year which have curbed profits growth. In September it announced pre-tax profits up 5 per cent to Pounds 18.2m for the 12 months to June 30.</p>

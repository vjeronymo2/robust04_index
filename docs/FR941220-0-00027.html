			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree with the commenters that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement would be overly burdensome and have revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed &sect;484.36(b)(2)(iii) to require each aide to receive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at least 12 hours of in-service training per 12 month  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period. Without the requirement that the training be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received in each calendar year, this provision will allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HHAs a full 12 months to provide the required in-service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training to newly hired home health aides. The revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement will also allow HHAs greater flexibility in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheduling in-service training programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that the provision of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;484.36(c) requiring the registered nurse to assign the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> home health aide to a specific patient reduces the HHA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheduling flexibility and ability to send a substitute aide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the event of sickness or other unforeseen circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This requirement represents no change from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the current requirements of this section. Although we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> understand that this requirement may slightly reduce the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HHA's scheduling flexibility, we believe that the benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be gained by its encouragement of consistency in care and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> familiarity between patient and home health aide far  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outweighs any reduction in scheduling flexibility. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement does not prevent the assignment of more than one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aide to a patient, and we certainly do not intend it to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preclude the use of a substitute aide when illness or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unforseen circumstances prevents the regularly scheduled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aide from providing services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that a licensed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practical nurse (LPN) should be allowed to perform the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required home health aide supervisory visit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We do not agree. We believe that the more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extensive educational background of a registered nurse (RN)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> makes the RN better equipped to assess the care provided by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the home health aide as well as the total effect of the care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the patient's condition. Therefore, we believe that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is in the best interest of the patient's health and safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to require that supervisory visits be performed by an RN.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It has long been Medicare policy that the RN's extensive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professional training uniquely qualifies him or her to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perform evaluation and supervisory functions. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognition of the RN's qualifications is represented not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only in this section but in &sect;484.30, which describes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> skilled nursing services, &sect;484.16, which describes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> group of professional personnel, and &sect;484.14(d), which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires therapeutic services to be furnished under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supervision of a physician or RN.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter opposed the requirement that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supervisory visit be performed no less frequently than every  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two weeks as costly to the HHA and unnecessary because these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patients are regularly seen by a nurse or therapist who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely performs a basic assessment of the care furnished by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the home health aide anyway.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We disagree with the commenter. If the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patient is receiving skilled care from a registered nurse or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therapist on a biweekly basis, then the professional can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> easily perform the required supervisory visit during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> course of his or her visit to furnish covered skilled care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, we believe that patients in the situation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described by the commenter present little cost or difficulty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to an HHA scheduling supervisory visits. Not all patients,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, receive skilled nursing or therapy services on such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a regular basis. When a patient is receiving skilled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nursing or therapy services, we believe that it is in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> best interest of the patient to require the registered nurse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or appropriate therapist to supervise and assess the care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furnished by the home health aide on a biweekly basis. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supervisory visit ensures that the aide services will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regularly assessed to ensure that they are furnished  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properly and of benefit to the treatment of the patient's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> illness or injury.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Many commenters oppose the proposed provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in &sect;484.36(d)(2)(i), which would have required at least one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supervisory visit per month to occur while the aide is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furnishing services if the patient is receiving one or more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> skilled services. Many commenters also oppose the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision in paragraph (d)(2)(ii), which would have required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all supervisory visits to occur while the aide is furnishing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services when the aide is not employed directly by the HHA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We have accepted these comments and are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including these proposed supervisory requirements contained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in &sect;484.36(d)(2)(i) and (ii) in the final rule. We have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concluded that the improvement in the quality of home health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aide services that has occurred as a result of the home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health aide training and competency evaluation requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implemented in 1990, as well as the increase in patient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in care that has resulted from the recently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implemented patient rights requirements of &sect;484.10, make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed requirements for direct aide supervision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unnecessary. These requirements were proposed in response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a study published by the Office of the Inspector General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in September 1987. (``Home Health Aide Services for Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Patients'', OA1&hyph;02&hyph;86&hyph;00010, September 1987.) Since the time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this study was completed, however, we have instituted the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training and evaluation requirements referred to above as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well as annual in-service training and performance review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. We believe that these requirements have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly improved the quality and oversight of home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health aide services. In addition, the institution of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patient rights requirements has given home health patients a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more comprehensive knowledge of their rights regarding care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> planning and provision. This, in effect, lets the patient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> play a greater role in the oversight of the care he or she  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

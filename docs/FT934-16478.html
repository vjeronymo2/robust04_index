			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / A rose by any other name: Guy de Jonquieres examines the malaise affecting several product brands as consumers switch to private-label lines Since Philip Morris, the US tobacco company, stunned Wall Street six months ago by slashing the price of Marlboro cigarettes in the face of sliding sales, manufacturers of other consumer products, from chocolate to toothpaste, have anxiously protested that such a catastrophe could not happen to their brands. Yet the humbling of Marlboro increasingly looks like one, particularly dramatic, symptom of a wider malaise afflicting consumer goods industries. On both sides of the Atlantic, many branded products continue to lose share to retailers' cheaper private-label lines. With prices under pressure, manufacturers everywhere are relying heavily on cost-cutting to bolster profit margins. Recession, the growth of more powerful retailers and 'value-conscious' consumer attitudes are often held responsible. However, the search for culprits has recently found another target - the marketing skills which most consumer products manufacturers have long considered the bedrock of their business. Even the industry's harshest critics agree brand leaders such as Coca-Cola, Gillette and Kellogg, and some smaller players, such as Britain's Cadbury-Schweppes and Ferrero of Italy, remain models of excellence. But in other companies, the austere climate of the 1990s is exposing underlying weaknesses which were masked by buoyant consumer spending and steadily rising profits in the 1980s. Professor John Quelch of Harvard Business School, a marketing expert and adviser to companies including Mars, Nestle and Procter &amp; Gamble, blames complacency. 'Consumer products manufacturers tend to think they are the fount of all marketing wisdom. But in reality many have become excruciatingly myopic and arrogant,' he says. Similar criticisms have been levelled by McKinsey, the management consultancy, which has many leading consumer goods companies as clients. In a hard-hitting article entitled 'Marketing's mid-life crisis', two of McKinsey's European directors say consumer marketing has grown ineffective and needs to be radically rethought. Some industry executives agree. Mr Crispin Davis, a former top marketer with P&amp;G who now heads United Distillers (UD), Guinness' spirits division, says: 'Much consumer goods marketing has not been nearly as good as it should have been.' The situation is even worse than it appears, he says, because in some companies marketing spending has lagged sales growth in the past decade  - or even fallen in absolute terms - while a growing share of it consists of price discounts to retailers. In the US, such attitudes appear so prevalent that the lead article in the current Harvard Business Review argues, as if reporting a recent discovery, that companies which invest consistently in marketing over a long period earn better returns than those which insist on quick results. Marketing departments are increasingly faulted, often within their own companies, for taking their eye off the ball. McKinsey blames creeping bureaucratisation: it estimates that the typical department in larger companies spends 80 per cent of its time on routine administrative chores and only 20 per cent working on product innovation strategy and ways of serving retailers and consumers better. If that sounds reminiscent of companies such as General Motors and Philips a decade or so ago, it may be partly because consumer goods producers have not been exposed to the Japanese export competition which has forced so many other western manufacturing industries to slim down, restructure and re-examine their approach to customers. Of Japan's consumer goods companies, only cosmetics maker Shiseido and drinks companies such as Asahi and Suntory have made much effort to expand abroad. Japanese competition has, however, found a proxy in the retail trade. As the power of big supermarket groups in many countries has increased, they have not only driven harder bargains with their suppliers but are increasingly challenging their traditional franchise with consumers. The threat is coming from two main directions. One is the rapid growth of aggressive discount retailers, such as Aldi of Germany and and US warehouse 'clubs' such as Costco. Though many offer only limited grocery ranges, their high volumes, thin margins and low costs result in exceptionally cheap prices which are challenging the traditional marketing strategies of both manufacturers and other retailers. A potentially even more menacing development is occurring at the other end of the market, due to the growing sophistication of private-label ranges. These were long dismissed by manufacturers as commodity products or inferior imitations which sold purely on price - much as Detroit derided early car exports from Japan. Yet in several countries private-label lines are now taking on estab-lished brands on their own terms. In the US, private-label has recently eaten into high-margin categories once held to be impregnable, such as breakfast cereals, cookies and beauty products, and many consumers now rate its quality equal to that of manufacturer brands. In the UK, where private-label is stronger than in any other country, it dominates some newer markets for fast-growing premium products, such as chilled recipe dishes. Out of these developments, a new battlefield is emerging. Manufacturers have gradually recognised that their struggle with retailers is no longer simply over prices and shelf space but over the essence of their competitive advantage - brand strength and the profit margins which go with it. The trend has been particularly pronounced in Britain, where supermarkets' success in fattening margins by moving private-label up-market in the 1980s has recently inspired similar efforts by some North American and continental retailers. J. Sainsbury and Tesco, the two biggest chains, now rank among the 10 most heavily advertised UK brands - ahead of those of almost all their suppliers  -while their marketing emphasises image and intangible benefits such as quality, service and value, as well as individual product lines. Whether that repositioning will prevent them losing sales to 'hard' grocery discounters is uncertain. But the big supermarkets' efforts to place private-label on a par with manufacturer brands seems likely to continue thanks to two strengths, also shared by retailers such as Marks and Spencer and Boots. One is investment in highly efficient distribution systems and stringent product and quality control standards, which sometimes exceed those of branded manufacturers. The other is unmatched access to immediate information about consumer purchasing patterns. Retailers have no clearer idea than branded manufacturers how housewives will behave tomorrow, or why. But they know far more about what they bought yesterday, thanks to the reams of data churned out by their point-of-sale systems. That offers a big advantage in bringing new products to market. While manufacturers have to spend months test-marketing innovations and large sums to market them, supermarkets can experiment cheaply at low risk by stocking their shelves with goods developed to their specifications and watching how they sell. Faced with these challenges, how can branded manufacturers regain the initiative? Some have sought to turn from confrontation to co-operation with retailers. The trend was pioneered by an informal partnership between P&amp;G and Wal-Mart, the large US discount chain, and has been emulated by other manufacturers such as Mars and Coca-Cola. Such arrangements aim to increase both partners' sales and manage the supply chain more efficiently by sharing information. Their success may depend, though, on manufacturers being undisputed brand leaders which can offer retailers in-depth product market expertise. Even where that is the case, the spread of such partnerships is still inhibited by mutual suspicion and hostility, particularly in Europe. But the toughest challenge remains to come up with products which consumers really want to buy. Though recession has made low price the overriding concern for some consumers, there is plenty of evidence that many are ready to pay a premium if they are really convinced they are getting something special for it. Few producers have found it easy to come up with such products in recent years, despite a frenzy of new product launches. There were 11,500 in the US food industry last year, double the number in 1985. However, many involved minor brand extensions, cosmetic packaging changes and copycat products. There is a growing belief in the industry that such tactics have proved counter-productive by cluttering supermarket shelves with similar goods and heightening consumer scepticism towards advertising claims. Some manufacturers now accept that a bigger effort is needed to raise the standards of new products and differentiate them from the competition, by focusing development more tightly and concentrating more marketing resources behind fewer brands. That, in turn, is prompting a rethinking of management and marketing methods. Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch group, has radically restructured Elida Gibbs, its UK personal products subsidiary, by abolishing traditional management divisions and creating teams which co-operate at every phase of the product cycle, from research to sales. Kraft General Foods, part of Philip Morris, is also experimenting with teamwork in an effort to beef up product development and marketing in Europe. But the benefits of such reorganisation also have to be effectively communicated to consumers. That is an issue on which opinions differ sharply. Unilever, for instance, stoutly defends the virtues of classic mass-market advertising. But Nestle of Switzerland, the world's largest food group, is far more sceptical. Mr Peter Brabeck, Nestle's chief marketing strategist, believes the growing power of retailers, the fragmentation of television media and more sophisticated shopping habits have made it increasingly hard to influence consumers: 'People today don't just act because someone tells them something,' he says. 'You have to find a way to communicate which is believable and relevant to them.' One option favoured by Nestle and a growing number of other companies is to resort to more direct channels of communication. With the aid of detailed databases about shoppers, they hope to encourage loyalty by rewarding regular customers and informing them directly of new products and special offers. Some industry experts say, though, that what producers really need to do is to listen more. A survey by Professor Quelch found that US consumer brand managers typically spent only three per cent of their time in face-to-face contact with buyers of their products and relied for most of their inform-ation on numerical market research data. 'Most companies are not spending enough time really understanding consumers,' says Mr Davis of UD. He says some of his most useful market research is done on Saturday mornings, when he regularly visits his local supermarket to watch shoppers in action. He has also arranged for his managers to spend evenings serving at bar counters. One recent result was the discovery that Black Label scotch was selling poorly in Greece because status-conscious drinkers thought the bottles could not be seen clearly in dark night clubs. Successful marketing has always required fanatical attention to such apparently trivial details. If brands have lost some of pulling power, it is because too many producers have forgotten that their value depends largely on finding out what consumers want and giving it to them at the right price. In that sense, their biggest challenge is to get back to basics.  -------------------------------------------------------------------                  DEVELOPMENT OF DISCOUNTERS IN EUROPE  -------------------------------------------------------------------                   Share of food         Sales 1992     Increase                sales by value, 1992       Ecu bn       over 1991                      per cent            per cent       per cent  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium                19                   2.41           6.6 France                  2                   2.13         100.9 Germany                25                   24.3          11.4 Netherlands            11                   1.71           8.9 Spain                   6                    1.1           7.8 Sweden                  6                   0.98          58.1 UK                      8                   4.62          32.4  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Nielsen  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

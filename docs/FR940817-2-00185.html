			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change also amends provisions of the By-Laws to lower the number of votes required to call a special meeting from 75% to 25% of the outstanding voting power (Article 2, Section 2.3), to provide for waiver of notice of a stockholders' meeting (Article 2, Section 2.4), and to authorize the board of directors to establish the salaries of MBSCC's officers (Article 5, Section 5.2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 2 of the Shareholders Agreement specifies how Participant Directors and members of the nominating committee <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  are elected. As is currently the practice, the nominating committee will nominate candidates for Participant Directors and members of the following year's nominating committee. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  Participants are given the opportunity to petition for additional candidates. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  If no petitions are filed, the participant shareholders must elect the candidates nominated by the nominating committee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Under Section 2(A)(ii) of the Shareholders Agreement, no person who is a current member of the board or who was a member of the board or nominating committee for the prior year may be elected to the nominating committee. Members of the nominating committee must be officers or general partners of or hold similar management positions with MBSCC participants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The nominating committee must submit its list of nominees to the Secretary of MBSCC no later than sixty days before the annual meeting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The petition must be signed by a least five participants and filed with the Secretary of MBSCC at least thirty days prior to the annual meeting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If there are competing candidates due to a petition or petitions being filed, ballots will be mailed to all participants. Pursuant to Section 2(A)(iii) of the Shareholders Agreement, each participant of MBSCC is entitled to the number of votes determined by multiplying the number of persons to be elected Participant Directors at the annual meeting by one vote for each $1,000 of average monthly volume-related fees (rounded down to the nearest one thousand dollars) payable or paid by the participant to MBSCC during the preceding year (``Voting Entitlement''). <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  Every participant shall have at least one vote. Each participant may cast all of its votes for a single nominee or distribute its votes among several nominees. Participants Owners of Class A stock must vote their shares as determined by the vote of all of the participants whether or not the voting participants are shareholders. In the event of a tie vote, the nominating committee selects the person who is to be elected director. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Shareholders Agreement contains special provisions for participants that are bank holding companies (``BHC'') (as such term is defined under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956) and their affiliates. The voting entitlement of a BHC participant and its affiliates is limited to 4.9% of the total voting entitlements. The voting entitlement of all BHC participants and their affiliates is limited to 24.9% of the total voting entitlements. Should the sum of the voting entitlements of all BHC participants exceed 24.9%, each BHC participant's voting entitlement will be reduced pro rata to comply with the 24.9% limitation. The 4.9% limitation will not apply to a BHC participant if that BHC participant provides confirmation from the appropriate bank regulatory agency that the limitation is not applicable to that BHC participant. The 24.9% limitation will not apply to BHC participants if any BHC participant provides confirmation from the appropriate bank regulatory agency that the total voting entitlements of all BHC participants can exceed 24.9% of the total voting entitlements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Croatia holding firm to demands for peacekeepers CROATIA yesterday played a game of brinkmanship at the United Nations, holding firm to demands for a tougher peacekeeping mandate to enforce Serb rebels to comply with a peace plan. UN diplomats yesterday sought backing from Russia for a compromise proposal for a new mandate for the 14,000-strong peacekeeping force in Croatia. Russia on Thursday blocked the proposal which linked the lifting of severe sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro to the resolution of the stand-off in Croatia. Croatian officials were disappointed that it stopped short of empowering peacekeepers to give Zagreb control over Serb-held territory, which accounts for one-third of Croatia and cuts the country in two. In an effort to avert an all-out war between Serbia and Croatia, the Security Council yesterday tried to renew the mandate, after gaining a 24-hour extension to persuade the Russians to back the plan. In Geneva meanwhile, the international mediators in the Bosnian conflict, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, said they had no immediate plans to reconvene the talks between the three warring factions, following the rejection of the latest peace plan by the mainly Moslem Bosnian parliament on Wednesday. The mediators yesterday met Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, and General Jean Cot, the UN force commander in ex-Yugoslavia, to discuss how to protect the humanitarian relief effort if the war continues. Meanwhile, UNHCR officials said the agency had raised only half the Dollars 350m (Pounds 227m) estimated cost of its 'winterisation' programme for Bosnia.</p>

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Wheat council raises world crop estimate by 11m tonnes THE INTERNATIONAL Wheat Council has raised its forecast for world wheat production in 1993-94 by 11m tonnes from the level it was projecting last month. In the latest issue of its monthly Grain Market Report, published yesterday, it puts the crop at 573m tonnes, which would also be 11m tonnes up from actual output in 1992-93, and second only to the 1990 record of 592m tonnes. The increase from last months report chiefly reflects higher projections for China (up 5m tonnes at 102m) and the Russian Federation (up 4m tonnes at 47m). The report cautions, however, that although prospects for Russian grain crops are reported to be generally favourable 'some commentators have drawn attention to the possibility of heavy losses during, as well as after, harvesting'. Shortages of equipment and fuel are reported to be severe in some regions, it says, and 'storage facilities remain inadequate'. Other countries for which estimates have been increased significantly since publication of the July report include the US (up 1m tonnes at 69m), Argentina (up 1.5m tonnes at 10.5m) and Canada (up 1.2m tonnes at 29m). However, the IWC's Canadian forecast is 1.3m tonnes below an estimate published this week by Statistics Canada. The IWC's forecast for the European Community is reduced from 83.9m to 83m tonnes, which would be 2.2m down from 1992-93. While overall availability of wheat is expected to more than adequate, the IWC warns that there may be a problem with quality as 'unfavourable harvesting conditions have prevailed in many parts of the northern hemisphere'. It suggests therefore that demand for good quality wheat may have to be met to some extent out of stocks carried over from earlier crops. The lower quality wheat from the current crop may, in turn, help to redress the balance in the coarse grains sector as it competes with maize in the livestock feed market. The report puts world course grain production in 1993-94 at 810m tonnes, down just 1m from last month's forecast but 49m tonnes below 1992-93 output. The fall from last year is almost entirely due to the effect of the Midwest floods on US maize prospects. US coarse grains output is now projected to reach only 222.4m tonnes, down from 229m tonnes in the July report and 277.7m tonnes in 1992-93. But the latest cut in the US estimate has been compensated by increases indicated for the EC (by 1.4m tonnes to 82.1m), Kazakhstan (by 1.2m tonnes to 11.6m), the Russian Federation (by 2.6m tonnes to 53.7m) and Canada (by 1.6m tonnes to 24.1m).</p>

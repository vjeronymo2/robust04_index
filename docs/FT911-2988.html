			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (32): The specialist route into emerging markets may be volatile - Investment trusts INVESTMENT TRUSTS have been steadily forced into specialisation over the last decade. The large general trusts, which were the flagships of the industry, have been whittled away by takeover and reconstruction. Institutional investors, rightly or wrongly, just did not perceive that the trusts' managers added value. In contrast, specialist trusts, by concentrating on investment areas that are illiquid or arcane, can bring value to the institutional portfolio. For private investors, specialist funds are really the only way they can gain access to emerging markets, such as Korea. And a closed-end structure lends support to the managers. There are funds for a wide variety of markets, including New Zealand, Thailand and Spain. There are also other closed-end funds on offer which, though not officially deemed investment trusts, have many of the same qualities. Many of these funds, which can be found in the Finance, Land section of the FT prices pages are dollar-based investments. Perhaps the most successful specialist trust of all concentrates on a field that is closer to home. Electra Investment Trust concentrates on the unquoted sector and, since the start of 1980, has outperformed the FT All-Share Index by almost 30 per cent and the FT Investment Trust Index by around 8 per cent. The trust has some 70 per cent of its portfolio in unquoted investments and a wide geographical spread, with more than 40 per cent outside the UK. The concentration on unquoteds is both an advantage and a disadvantage: it means that the trust has a tendency to value its investments conservatively, which may underplay its strengths; but it also means that the asset value is less volatile. Volatility is the problem for many specialised trusts. Not only is investing in a niche area inherently more of a volatile business, but such trusts often move to a premium to net assets in their early days, since they represent one of the best ways for investors to gain access to what is usually a fashionable area of the market. When the area becomes unfashionable again, and prices drop sharply, the trust then falls to a discount, creating a 'double whammy' effect for investors. Private investors need iron nerves before backing such a trust, and should ensure that a specialised holding is part of a more diversified portfolio.</p>

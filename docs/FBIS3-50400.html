Information gathered from several sources in Belgrade seems to  indicate this. In particular, we have been receiving reports of  the mobilization of Serbian refugees in the rump Yugoslavia, who  are being called up by the Serbian armies in Bosnia and Krajina.  Belgrade authorities are denying all involvement in this  mobilization, but the High Commission for Refugees in Belgrade  believes that the operation would be impossible without the  collaboration of the local authorities. Florence Hartmann [LE  MONDE correspondent in Belgrade] reports:    [Begin Hartmann recording] A form with the heading -- Your  Country Calls On You -- is being sent out to Bosnian [Serb]  refugees in Serbia and Montenegro calling them back to serve on  the front. Suffering from a shortage of manpower, the Bosnian  Serbs are recruiting with the help of threats and with  Belgrade's backing. Those who do not answer the call-up will  lose their refugee status and could even face a prison sentence.  Defying international conventions, the civilian and military  authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are providing  lists of refugees, distributing call-up papers and transferring  the troops to the combat zones. The Belgrade authorities are  nevertheless officially denying their collaboration in this  activity. For now, we are unable to estimate the scope of this  mobilization, but several hundred called-up refugees have  alerted the UNHCR to the situation. The UN is advising them to  stay in hiding. Several refugee shelters in Serbia and  Montenegro have been deserted in recent days by all men of  fighting age; or rather by all men of any age, since the call-up  also includes refugees of 60 as well as men exempted from  military duties for medical reasons.    Having failed to obtain a [Muslim] signature on the Bosnia  peace plan, the Serbs seem decided to inflict total defeat on  the Muslim side.    Florence Hartmann, Belgrade, RFI. [end recording]</p>

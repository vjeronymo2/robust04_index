			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Letter: Initiative represents real training opportunity Sir, Mr Ansel Harris (Letters, June 24) described Training and Enterprise Councils as being 'essentially a repackaging of earlier government initiatives'. Of course, the Tec movement has inherited some programmes from government but the focus is substantially different from any previous measures. Tecs are principally catalysts for bringing about a cultural change of attitude to training - they are not simply about the delivery of government funded programmes or narrowly focused schemes. Will Tecs be able to bring about the change required? Only time will tell, but early indicators are promising. The Tec initiative was launched in 1989 and the last of the Tecs was operational almost two years ahead of schedule. Furthermore, investment in training is, as a consequence of Tec endeavours, increasingly being seen by business leaders as a means of improving the bottom line benefits of company performance. The new Tec initiative, Investors in People (IiP), is a major part of Tec strategy to increase the momentum of change. At last, companies which demonstrate a commitment to increasing skills will receive public recognition. The focus for IiP is clear. Approximately 80 per cent of the workforce in this Tec area are employed by the largest 20 per cent of companies. Inevitably, Tecs will focus their endeavours where there will be greatest impact so larger companies will be targeted, but not to the exclusion of smaller businesses which may have already recognised the benefits of investing in their people. IiP will increase the demand for training and I am hopeful that colleges, and in particular, The College of North West London, will respond to this. In the meantime, this Tec will continue its financial support for the college. It is regrettable that Mr Harris appears to link the IiP initiative with the underfunding of The College of North West London. In doing this, not only is he adding oranges and apples to arrive at bananas, but he is failing to recognise that IiP could open up new markets and sources of income.

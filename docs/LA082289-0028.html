			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MOTHER OF BABY SHAMU DIES AFTER COLLISION IN SHOW  </P> <P> Kandu, a killer whale who gave birth last year at Sea World, died Monday after  a collision with another female whale during a show at the marine park.  </P> <P> Sea World officials issued a terse statement saying the 14-year-old Kandu died  after a "physical interaction" with "Corky" during the 4 p.m. killer whale  show. Sea World officials refused to provide any other information about the  circumstances of the killer whale's death.  </P> <P> There were conflicting versions of when the collision occurred. Some witnesses  said the whales collided in the performing area of the 5-million-gallon tank  while moving at high speeds. Others said it must have happened when the whales  were in a holding area behind the main pool or in a tunnel connecting the pen  with the main pool.  </P> <P> Kandu weighs about 6,000 pounds, Corky weighs about 8,000 pounds.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Ignored Commands'  </P> <P> Ed Maley and Ruth Jacobsen, who are vacationing from New Jersey and witnessed  the incident, said that, during the second part of the whale show, the two  females and the baby were in the main pool performing. Maley said the collision  must have occurred under water, where it was not visible to the audience. The  two females then began circling the pool at high speed "for no apparent reason"  and ignored the trainers' commands.  </P> <P> Maley said that, at one point, Kandu broke away and approached a male whale,  who was locked in a separate holding pen, for a few seconds before she began  circling the pool again. When she began circling the pool a second time, Maley  noticed the blood.  </P> <P> "It wasn't just a little bit of blood. It was all over the place. It dirtied  the whole pool. At one point, you just knew she was going to die," said Maley.  </P> <P> The bleeding whale swam toward the enclosure where Baby Shamu is kept and  disappeared from sight, Jacobsen said. Park officials said that Baby Shamu was  not involved in the incident.  </P> <P> "It looked like there was nothing they could do," said Jacobsen.  </P> <P> Several thousand people saw the  </P> <P> injuries and were escorted from the stadium after an abbreviated show.  </P> <P> "It's very obvious to you, as it is to us, that (Kandu) is bleeding," an  announcer at Shamu Stadium said. "We're not really sure what happened."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Blood Was Really Bad'  </P> <P> According to an Associated Press report, Jim Barnes -- who brought his family  from Stansbury Park, Utah, to visit Sea World while vacationing in San Diego --  said, "They enticed (Kandu) back to the holding pen and brought the other  female adult into the show pen and completed part of the show. Then they got  the mother whale into about 6 inches of water -- the baby was lying right there  next to her -- and the blood was really bad."  </P> <P> Ben Deeble, a Greenpeace whale expert from Seattle, said, "This is the first  death of its kind involving killer whales that I know of. A (killer whale) in  captivity is like keeping an eagle in a parakeet cage. In this case, they put  two eagles in a parakeet cage."  </P> <P> Deeble said that Greenpeace, an environmental group, was told that Corky and  Kandu have been rivals for female dominance in the Sea World killer-whale  pools.  </P> <P> Corky, who was performing under the name of Shamu, is about 25 years old and  was purchased from Marineland, near Los Angeles, about three years ago. Orky, a  male killer whale, was purchased from Marineland at the same time and died last  year.  </P> <P> Last September, Kandu gave birth to a whale calf during a performance. The baby  was named "Baby Shamu" and was sired by Orky, who died three days after the  baby whale was born.  </P> <P> Sea World officials said they do not believe that Kandu's death will have a  serious effect on Baby Shamu. According to officials, the baby is eating 40 to  45 pounds of solid food each day and "is sufficiently independent at this  time." Kandu and Baby Shamu were featured in television commercials that aired  throughout Southern California promoting the park.  </P> <P> Spokesmen for Sea World said that more information about the circumstances  surrounding the whale's death will be released today.Plans are under way for  Sea World veterinarians to perform a necropsy to determine the cause of death.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Second Incident  </P> <P> It was the second incident in two years in which killer whales at the park have  fought with each other, according to two people who witnessed an earlier  confrontation. John Fitzrandolph, a San Diego junior high school teacher, and  Deborah York, a San Luis Obispo reporter, said that, in June, 1987, they  witnessed a bloody confrontation between two whales in the same tank.  </P> <P> Fitzrandolph said he saw a 2 1/2-foot gash on one whale's left underbelly,  which was bleeding. On Monday, Sea World officials refused to comment on the  purported 1987 incident.  </P> <P> Sea World has been plagued with problems involving its killer whales over the  past two years. In November, 1987, trainers were pulled from the water after a  number of trainers were injured over an eight-month period while performing  with the animals.  </P> <P> The most serious incident involved trainer John Sillick, who was crushed when  one whale landed on top of him while he was riding another. Sillick suffered a  broken pelvis, femur and ribs.  </P></p>

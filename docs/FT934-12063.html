			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Paris, Bonn set out EC foreign policy priorities FRANCE and Germany yesterday proposed several foreign policy priorities for the newly-created European Union which comes into effect under the Maastricht treaty on Monday. They also suggested that ministers of the twelve meet more frequently to direct the European Community's executive. But a joint letter by President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl to the Belgian presidency of the EC fell well short of widespread expectations - and fears in countries such as Britain - that France and Germany would place an ambitious agenda in front of tomorrow's Community summit. Instead, both leaders stressed that they had 'no other ambition than to contribute towards implementing the Maastricht treaty' on European union, which comes into effect on November 1, and to give Europe 'credibility and the capacity to act'. Officials in Paris and Bonn underlined there was little new in the letter - a contrast to the way France and Germany have trumpeted their initiatives before past EC summits. Yet it was France and Germany who called for this week's special summit to celebrate final ratification, and plan the entry into force of the Maastricht pact. Mr Mitterrand and Mr Kohl now imply there is little to mark tomorrow's special meeting from the EC's regular mid-December summit except certain pressing foreign policy issues. The two leaders are calling for EC foreign ministers to push on with four particular 'joint actions' - a French-inspired plan to improve stability in Europe, an offer to host an international investment conference to bolster the Palestinian-Israeli peace plan, moves to ensure aid reaches Bosnia and to rebuild the town of Mostar there, and to provide observers for Russia's December 12 elections. The new proposal is for governments to provide more continuity to their ministerial presence in Brussels. This would involve junior EC affairs ministers meeting between the monthly sessions of foreign ministers. In France, which is still smarting from the Commission's Gatt negotiating tactics with the US, the idea was said to be to keep the EC executive under tighter control, but Bonn officials claimed it was merely to upgrade the twelve's diplomacy.

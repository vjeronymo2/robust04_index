			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / The Week In Luxembourg: Milking the Community cow - European Court Dairy farmers who were paid a premium by the European Community to take a five-year holiday from milk production are entitled to damages for lost income they would have received during the period under the EC additional milk levy quota, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled last week. The Court said the Community must compensate the farmers because they had accepted a temporary EC non-marketing premium for a period chosen by Dutch and German authorities under 1984 EC milk rules which the ECJ had already ruled invalid because they breach Community law on protection of legitimate expectations. The ECJ held that the Community had incurred liability because of its failure to take account of the specific situation of the producers affected without invoking any higher public interest. The extent of damage to be compensated was the loss of income that would otherwise have been earned. Income earned from alternative occupations had to be deducted in mitigation. Interest was awarded at the rate claimed but at a maximum of 8 per cent. The farmers were not entitled to further damages under a 1989 amendment to the milk rules which allowed producers a provisional quota. Although the 1989 amendment was equally invalid, the breach of EC law on protection of legitimate expectations was not sufficiently serious to entitle them to compensation because the Community legislature had considered all relevant interests in making its legitimate economic policy choice. All dairy farmers in the same situation as those in last week's test cases will be entitled to claim damages caused by invalid EC rules on the additional milk levy quota introduced in 1984, but not for any loss caused by the failure of the 1989 rules to allocate sufficient quota. However, those involved have as much as a year to agree the calculation of the amount of damages, in accordance with principles laid down by the Court. So while final adjudication in the event of disagreement is reserved to the Court, further delay and complications are likely before any dairy farmers are compensated. Mulder and others v Council and Commission, Joined Cases C-104/89 and C-37/90, FC, 19 May 1992. Last Friday, ECJ president Ole Due refused the European Commission's application for interim measures against the UK in a case concerning the scope of the monopoly enjoyed under EC law by the five UK Milk Marketing Boards (MMBs) over 'milk produced and marketed without processing'. The UK says the monopoly covers all forms of liquid milk for direct human consumption including skimmed and semi-skimmed milk. The Commission disagrees, claiming that the MMBs' exclusive rights are limited to whole milk. The ECJ president, who customarily decides interim measures cases alone, did not examine the merits of the dispute, rejecting the Commission's application on the ground of lack of urgency. In particular, he held that the milk producers concerned had sufficient safeguards that the status quo would be maintained until judgment by the full court without danger of serious and irreparable damage. He accepted undertakings by the MMBs not to enforce any rights over skimmed or semi-skimmed milk until the ECJ's final decision. Commission v UK, Case C-40/92 R, Order of the President of the Court, 22 May 1992. Permissible national controls - auditors The ECJ has delivered another significant judgment for the professions, and in particular auditors, building on earlier indications of the kind of national controls which member states may impose on individuals or companies established in one member state when they provide services or are engaged as employees in a second member state. In accordance with EC rules on establishment, an auditor authorised to practise in Luxembourg under Luxembourg law, and employed by an authorised Luxembourg company, may not have his authorisation removed simply on the ground that he no longer satisfies the condition of Luxembourg law which restricts authorisation to auditors established in Luxembourg, when he moves his centre of operations to Germany, and is employed by a German company related to his Luxembourg employer. However, the Rome Treaty rules on free movement of workers and freedom to provide services permit Luxembourg to require the auditor to comply with certain rules which can be objectively justified in the public interest and are equally applicable to Luxembourg auditors, if the requirements in the member state where he is established are not equivalent. In the current case, this meant that, within its own territory, Luxembourg could require compliance with rules objectively necessary to ensure professional rules applicable to auditors are observed, and require an effective presence and a permanent infrastructure in Luxembourg as well as the supervision of an auditor's compliance with professional ethics. Ramrath v Minister of Justice, Case C-106/91, 6CH 20 May 1992. Cheaper German roads The ECJ had condemned a German law, previously suspended in 1990 by interim order of the Court, increasing the tax imposed on heavy lorries using Federal roads. The tax was held to infringe the Rome Treaty's 'standstill' rule prohibiting the introduction of new road transport measures with the direct or indirect effect of discriminating against transport from other member states. The discrimination resulted from the fact that, while German road hauliers were subject to the same increase, they received a reduction in motor vehicle tax which was not shared by those from other member states. This judgment will save road hauliers of all member states the additional costs when crossing Germany, in particular, to eastern Europe. Commission v Germany, Case C-195/90, FC 19 May 1992. Other cases In four cases of less general significance, the ECJ rejected cases brought by Greece challenging the clearance of its 1987 CAP accounts (Case C-385/89) and by the Commission against Germany unsuccessfully claiming that German rules infringed the Treaty rules on free movement of goods by applying stricter rules to eye drops as a result of defining them as medicinal products instead of as cosmetics (Case C-290/90). The court upheld the Commission in finding that the Netherlands had failed to implement correctly, within the time laid down, the 1982 directive on risks of certain big industrial accidents (Case C-190/90) as well as interpreting certain terms in the directive on the treatment of employees in the case of the transfer of undertakings in the special context of certain Dutch social work foundations (Case C-29/91). FT Commercial Law Reports Following the introduction of the European Court column, FT commercial law reports now appear on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. There will be no European Court column next week as the court is not sitting. All dairy farmers in the same situation as those in last week's test cases will be entitled to claim damages caused by invalid EC rules on the additional milk levy quota introduced in 1984</p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: PEOPLE WATCH  </P> <P> Murdersomething: Ken Olin, the sensitive yuppie Michael Steadman of  "thirtysomething," will play a murderous yuppie in a TV movie this fall about  Boston's bizarre Charles Stuart case.  </P> <P> Olin has been cast as Charles Stuart, the Boston furrier who duped the nation  when he told police a black gunman had killed his pregnant wife, Carol. Police  now believe Stuart killed his wife and then wounded himself in an elaborate  plot to cash in on insurance policies and then committed suicide in January.  There's no word yet on who will play Carol Stuart. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Good inflation news is offset by profit-taking Wall Street US share prices ended little changed yesterday after early profit-taking had overshadowed good news on inflation and a sharp drop in bond yields, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.68 at 3,848.63. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished a marginal 0.04 up at 474.17, while the American SE composite gained a net 0.50 at 479.87 and the Nasdaq composite was 1.35 firmer at 786.87. NYSE volume totalled 310.7m shares, and rises outpaced declines by 1,129 to 938. The day's big economic news was bullish for financial markets. The government announced that its index of producer prices rose by only 0.1 per cent in December, and the 'core' measure of producer price inflation (which excludes the volatile food and energy components) increased by 0.2 per cent during the month. The data were in line with expectations, but still produced a strong reaction from the bond market, where prices of long-dated government securities advanced sharply, pushing yields lower. In the late afternoon the benchmark 30-year bond was up about a point and the yield was down to 6.169 per cent. Neither the inflation numbers, nor the bond market's strong performance, however, was able to breathe life into the equity market, where investors continued to take profits in the wake of the six-day long new year rally. However, the profit-taking was not especially heavy, although, as on Tuesday, some stocks tied closely to the economic cycle (many of which have risen substantially in recent days) were targeted by the sellers. Auto makers, which have been in particularly heavy demand lately as investors bet on another year of improving car and truck sales, retreated. Ford slipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 67 1/2 , General Motors Dollars  1/8 to 59 1/4 and Chrysler Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 59. Westinghouse Electric eased Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 13 5/8 in volume of almost 3.9m shares as investors responded to the news that the company will take charges of Dollars 750m in a restructuring that will cut Westinghouse's workforce by 6,000. The company also plans to raise Dollars 500m of new capital to bolster its balance sheet. After firming early on, American Express ended down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 30 5/8 after an analyst at Merrill Lynch upgraded his rating on the stock from 'neutral' to 'above average'. Fannie Mae moved ahead Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 85 3/8 on news of record fourth-quarter and annual earnings of Dollars 493.6m and Dollars 1.87bn respectively. On the Nasdaq market, leading technology stocks were mixed, with Intel Dollars 1 5/8 higher at Dollars 68 3/8 , Microsoft up just Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 85 1/2 and Apple Computer off Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 30 1/2. Canada Toronto stocks staged a late-session turnround in extremely heavy trade on a rebound in bank issues and a continued strong rise in media shares. The TSE 300 index was finally 7.3 up at an all-time peak of 4,454.7 and advances led falls by 403 to 390 after volume of 99.5m shares, the fourth heaviest day's trade on record, and valued at CDollars 1.32bn.</p>

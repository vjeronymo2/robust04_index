			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> STATE MAY CHALLENGE PIERSIDE SETTLEMENT  </P> <P> State Deputy Atty. Gen. Robert G. Collins said an agreement Tuesday ending a  four-year legal battle over land on which the city hopes to build its Pierside  Village project does not clarify title to the site.  </P> <P> "It's our view that the city still does not have clear title" to the land,  Collins said. He spoke outside court shortly after Orange County Superior Court  Judge Robert Todd accepted an agreement between the city and the state that  ended the city's four-year lawsuit involving Pierside Village land.  </P> <P> The city's suit sought to obtain ownership to three acres of beach-bluff land  at Pacific Coast Highway and Main Street. The city hopes to use the property  for a "restaurant row" development called Pierside Village.  </P> <P> The city's legal action succeeded in getting the three joint owners of the land  -- Chevron USA, the Huntington Beach Co. and Southern Pacific Transportation  Co. -- to donate their interest in the property to the city. In addition, the  state agreed to stipulate in the case that no state-owned tidelands are  involved in the land being sought by the city.  </P> <P> Deputy City Atty. Robert Sangster said that the city's lawsuit thus cleared  ownership title to the land and that the entire package of land now belongs to  the city. Sangster said the beach-bluff acreage, which is immediately south of  the pier, can now be considered city-owned property, able to be leased to  commercial restaurants in the proposed Pierside Village project.  </P> <P> But Collins on Tuesday said he strongly disagrees that the city has gained  title to the land. He said he believes that the Southern Pacific Transportation  Co.'s land donation to the city is legally faulty because it incorrectly  defined the land boundaries and because it incorrectly claimed that no public  easement exists on the land. Collins noted that the property has had a public  easement, or right of way, on it since 1932.  </P> <P> "The title to the land is more confused now than before," Collins said.  </P> <P> The city must get state Coastal Commission approval for the project before  construction can begin.

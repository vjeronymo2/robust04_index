			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / International Company News: Nike seeks to reassure investors on share price NIKE, the US athletic shoe manufacturer, yesterday sought to reassure Wall Street over last month's sharp share price fall, triggered by a warning of lower-than-expected fiscal 1994 growth. 'The recent volatility in our stock is not consistent with the superior results we have generated over the past six years or with the potential growth we see in the future,' said Mr Philip Knight, chairman. The company announced that its board had authorised a plan to repurchase up to Dollars 450m of Nike class B common stock over the next three years. It also reported an 8.8 per cent rise in fourth-quarter 1993 net income, to Dollars 76.9m, or Dollars 1 a share, compared with Dollars 70.7m, or 92 cents, in the same period last year. Revenues rose 16 per cent to Dollars 983.3m. The figures were broadly in line with market expectations. They combined with Nike's other announcements to boost its shares Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 56 1/8 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. In the fourth quarter, its US athletic business saw revenues rise 13 per cent to Dollars 521m. US footwear revenues were up 21 per cent at Dollars 446m, while apparel revenues dipped 21 per cent ot Dollars 75m. International revenues rose 18 per cent to Dollars 406m, with footwear sales up 15 per cent to Dollars 295m and apparel up 25 per cent at Dollars 111m. Consolidated gross margins totalled 39.5 per cent, up from 38.6 per cent, while selling and administrative expenses were 26.2 per cent of revenues, up from 25.3 per cent. For the full 1993 year the company reported net income of Dollars 365m, or Dollars 4.74 a share, up 10 per cent from the Dollars 329.2m, or Dollars 4.30, reported last year. Revenues rose 15 per cent to Dollars 3.9bn. Mr Knight said he believed 1994 would be Nike's seventh consecutive record year, although several factors could cause its growth rate to slow temporarily. Continued weakness in Europe's larger economies and a stronger US dollar would limit international growth, while US retailers appeared to be ordering cautiously for the Christmas holiday season. However, he said these were temporary conditions and would not hamper growth in its international business.</p>

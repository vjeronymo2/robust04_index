			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Bundesbank stands by inflation policy THE Bundesbank's vigorous anti-inflation policy is in the best interests of the German economy and will contribute directly to the hoped-for economic upswing in the country's east, according to a member of the German central bank's policy-making directorate. Responding to criticisms from Mr Franz Steinkuhler, head of the IG Metall trade union earlier this week, Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum said in Frankfurt that the Bundesbank's stability-orientated monetary policy was far from being hostile to jobs and employees. On the contrary, he argued, stable prices could only help to promote a 'crisis-proof economic recovery' in the eastern part of Germany. If the policy were relaxed, those on normal incomes or living on savings would suffer most of all, Mr Gaddum said. His comments follow Mr Steinkuhler's denunciation of the Bundesbank's 'unrestrained power' and 'extensive and excessive' attention to inflation. Mr Steinkuhler said high interest rates, while aimed at reducing the growth in money supply, often had the effect of hitting companies' solvency and ability to invest and were retarding recovery in the eastern part of Germany.</p>

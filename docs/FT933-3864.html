			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Two more gas-fired stations go ahead MR TIM Eggar, energy minister, yesterday gave the go-ahead for two more gas-fired power stations, David Lascelles writes. They are a 1,200MW combined cycle gas turbine plant at Seabank, Avon, and a similar 710MW station at Keadby on Humberside. The Seabank station is being built by Midlands Electricity and British Gas, and Keadby by Hydro-Electric and Northern Electric. The gas-fired power station at Seabank on the Severn estuary is expected to cost Pounds 500m and will be owned and operated by Seabank Power, a joint venture between British Gas and Midlands Electricity. The stations are the latest in the controversial 'dash for gas' which has been blamed for causing the contraction of the coal industry.</p>

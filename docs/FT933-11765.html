			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major needs to hold the centre - Political Notebook SURPRISE, surprise. Mr John Major is a human being. Publication of the prime minister's off-the-cuff conversation with a television journalist has provoked the inevitable synthetic horror from some in the press. My goodness, Mr Major occasionally uses four-letter words. (Journalists never, ever swear). He is fed up with some of his cabinet colleagues. He is scathing about the has-beens and never-has-beens on the Tory back benches. He knows that he is referred to as a wimp. Those who take the trouble to study his conversation with Mr Michael Brunson of ITN will see the sort of exchange which occurs every day at Westminster between journalists and senior politicians. Mr Major swears a great deal less than one or two in his cabinet. He is kinder about his colleagues than some of them are about him. He is far too sensitive about what journalists say and write, but he can occasionally make fun of himself. As anyone who has spoken to him for more than a minute or so knows, he is more impressive in private conversations than when he is placed in front of a camera or on a podium. He makes no secret of his bitterness towards those who have used the conflict over Maastricht to undermine his political authority. He feels hemmed in by the combination of a small majority and the burning resentment of the Thatcherite dispossessed. The label 'bastards' was pinned on these embittered souls rather than on anyone in particular in the cabinet. His unguarded comments do reveal some of his weaknesses - his reluctance, for example, to sack errant ministers. The remarks have also raised eyebrows among those of his colleagues who have been admonished for speaking too freely to the press. By and large, however, the episode confirms the view of those insiders who have been saying for some time that, as the Maastricht battle has drawn to a close, Mr Major's confidence has begun to return. He is said to be sharper in cabinet committee meetings, less tolerant of the meandering debate which clogs up the Whitehall machine. He is trying to be himself again. Sir Gordon Reece, the man who built Lady Thatcher's prime ministerial image, no longer pays his weekly Sunday evening visit. Mr Major has even been seen pulling out his election soapbox to address informal gatherings at Number 10. It would be nice to say then, that with Maastricht over and the public offered a glimpse of the prime minister's more assertive inner self, his abysmal standing in the country might begin to recover. Sadly a few more unpleasant realities are about to intrude. Unless the electors of Christchurch have been engaged in a gigantic and inexplicable confidence trick, Friday morning may see the Conservative party waking up to the biggest by-election defeat in post-war history. Ministers insist it has been well-discounted. The summer recess means fewer of the awkward squad on the Tory backbenches will be around to snipe at the prime minister from radio and television studios. But the anticipated defeat will reverberate through the already disgruntled, and in some cases openly rebellious local party associations. The October conference, with revolts looming over the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel, on law and order, on Europe, and on much else threatens to be what one (indiscreet) senior minister terms 'a wretched affair'. If that fear is realised the buck will stop with a prime minister whose reputation for niceness was replaced some time ago with one for weakness. The party faithful, as much as the country at large, want that indefinable quality called leadership. So do the Tory MPs upon whose nerve - or lack of it - Mr Major's future will depend during the winter. They also want a sense of direction. The prime minister has failed to articulate a coherent programme for his government. After 14 years in office the promise of a crackdown on crime and a burst of deregulation is not enough. The anti-Europeans alone cannot topple him. The danger is that the uncommitted centre of the Tory party at Westminster is losing faith in his leadership. There are ideas around in Downing Street for a new prospectus. Sustaining an investment-led economic recovery, rebuilding industrial competitiveness and a linked drive to revitalise education and training policies are among the themes. But the prime minister has yet to put a thread through the beads. An unpopular November Budget will limit his room for manoeuvre. Legislation to allow higher British con-tributions to Brussels will give the Euro-sceptics the opportunity to launch another assault. The odds are that his unscripted outburst last week will do him no harm among the voters. It might even do him some good. But either way, Mr Major has much more important things to worry about.</p>

			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Mobile phone disconnections rise The intensifying battle between mobile phone companies to recruit customers is leading to a serious rise in fraud and the number of bad debtors, industry analysts say. The number of mobile phone users in the UK has nearly doubled, to 2.6m, since the start of 1993 with one in 20 of the population now owning a cellular handset. The rate of disconnections is also rising steadily, however. It is running at an annual rate equal to about 30 per cent of the number of mobile subscribers, according to BIS Strategic Decisions, an information technology consultancy. The consultancy estimates that about half of all disconnections are caused by people moving between mobile phone companies or between different types of usage. The other half are due to a combination of fraud and the inability of customers to keep up with their bills. Ms Gail Kirby, an analyst at the consultancy, said: 'It's a big problem, and it's getting more serious for the network operators as the number of subscribers rises so dramatically.' The three months to the end of June saw the number of disconnections rise, as a proportion of subscribers, for the fourth successive quarter. Vodafone, the largest cellular operator, was worst hit, with a disconnection rate equal to 34 per cent of its subscribers over a full year. Mr Terry Barwick, Vodafone's corporate affairs director, said: 'We have had problems with fraud, and are tightening our credit-checking system to reduce it.' He said some of the fraud appeared to be organised systematically, with some dealers stealing bonuses paid for new subscribers by means of fake subscriber names and personal details. The increase in disconnections also appears to be caused by customers being attracted to mobile phones by cut-price handset offers. Some cannot then keep up the monthly payments. Although handsets can be bought for as little as Pounds 30, monthly subscriptions can be Pounds 28.75 a month and calls can cost as much as 50p a minute. Lower monthly charges are available on low-user schemes, but call charges are then far higher and subscribers who - perhaps inadvertently - use the phone to make more than a few calls face hefty bills. One dealer said: 'Many people who buy mobile phones don't have a clue how much it actually costs to keep a mobile phone going - particularly if you use it.'</p>

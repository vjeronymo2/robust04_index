			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Blair casts long shadow over Ashdown's future: Philip Stephens says Labour, with a new leader, has shifted the ground on which the third force in politics is fighting It is the issue on everyone's mind. Most would prefer not to talk about it. Unsurprisingly, Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, was nowhere to be seen as the Liberal Democrats gathered in Brighton yesterday at the start of the autumn political season. His shadow was everywhere. The Labour party's decision to elect as its leader an aggressive and attractive young moderniser has shifted irrevocably the political ground on which the Liberal Democrats must fight the next election. The already threadbare pretence that the third force in British politics could remain neutral between the Conservatives and Labour has been torn open. The doctrine of 'equidistance', so cherished by Dr David Owen in the 1980s, when as leader of the now-defunct SDP he flirted with the Conservatives, no longer has even the pretence of credibility. Mr Paddy Ashdown's party does have other things to discuss in Brighton. In other circumstances it would feel entitled to some modest self-congratulation. It is only five years since the party almost destroyed itself during the break-up of the old Liberal-SDP Alliance. But it is still here, and as strong now as it has ever been in post-war politics. As Mr Ashdown never ceases to remind us, the Liberal Democrats hold a record 4,600 council seats as well as their 23 places at Westminster. After the heady by-election successes of Newbury, Christchurch and Eastleigh the European election result in June came as a disappointment. But the party's two seats in the Strasbourg assembly provide its first representation in Europe. More importantly the party, always relatively strong in Scotland, has broken out of its other bastion in Devon and Cornwall to establish a wider political base in south-west England. That means it has become more efficient in turning votes into seats. The electoral successes have been accompanied by a more mature approach to policymaking. Compared with their two larger opponents the Liberal Democrats still occasionally come up with pretty eclectic policies. Activists reserve the right to debate at length the sort of issues which ensure that the party is regularly panned in the tabloid press. The conference will argue whether the monarchy should be scrapped and whether young girls should have access to contraceptives. Mr Ashdown will find it hard to win time on television news bulletins for more important debates on the economy, the constitution and the environment. In spite of eccentricities Mr Ashdown has shifted the Liberal Democrats' political centre of gravity. It is true that some of the specific ideas - a massive shift away from value added tax to a raft of new pollution levies, hypothecation of income taxes, curfews for young criminals and local referendums on planning decisions - frequently owe more to a craving for distinctiveness than to careful analysis. But taken together the burst of policymaking since the 1992 general election has positioned the party on the hard centre-left. By and large it has come to terms with an enterprise-based economy, the need for flexible markets and the need for reform of public services. Mr Ashdown hopes that this week it will shy away from joining Labour in backing a national minimum wage and will cut its proposed top rate of income tax to 50 per cent. More broadly, ideas for constitutional reform now stretch well beyond the self-serving demand for proportional representation. The party is beginning to acknowledge that European integration will not solve all of Britain's problems. And there are signs that the hard-headed realities of Westminster are starting to be understood by the party's local activists. So it is understandable that Mr Ashdown should want to spend this week reinforcing the notion that his party has at last established a mature, distinctive identity. Third-party politics cannot, however, operate in a vacuum. The chorus of acknowledgements from senior party figures yesterday that the Liberal Democrats could not respond to an inconclusive general election by sustaining the Conservatives in office was in one sense stating the obvious. There has never been much logic to the notion that because the party is frequently a natural home for disgruntled Tory voters it must keep open the option of support for a Conservative administration. The Liberal Democrats are committed to pluralist government and constitutional reform. They cannot sustain in office a party that by the time of the next election will have governed Britain for 18 years. Admitting the obvious is one thing. Defining the possible extent of any collaboration with a Labour administration is altogether different. There are too many imponderables. The success of Mr Blair's project to turn Labour into a modern social democratic party is one. The outcome of the general election is another. Neither Liberal Democrats nor Labour can envisage pre-election pacts. If Mr Blair were to win an overall majority at Westminster his present inclination for co-operative rather than confrontational politics between the two parties may change. Mr Ashdown is right to say that the only option facing his party is to compete on independent ground before the next election. But he will not be able to hide the fact that there is only one route for the Liberal Democrats into government - behind Mr Blair.</p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Demise of miners' gala is postponed The Durham Miners' Gala, under threat because of the demise of the Durham coalfield, is to be held this year following a strong response to an appeal for financial support. Much to the surprise of the National Union of Mineworkers, companies are among those expressing interest in supporting the event, which in recent years has been a platform for leftwingers. While negotiations are in progress the NUM is not disclosing the names of potential backers of the biggest and most evocative annual working class rally in Britain. But Mr Dave Hopper, general secretary of the north-east NUM and of the Durham Miners Association, which stages the event, said yesterday the volume of offers meant the 110th gala - which is to cost Pounds 20,000 to mount - would definitely go ahead on July 9. The gala's subsequent future remains unclear: the NUM and DMA have been concerned to ensure that its leftwing radicalism is not diluted.</p>

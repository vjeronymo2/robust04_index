			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Patten offers olive branch to China Mr Chris Patten, the Hong Kong governor, yesterday offered a working-level role to members of Beijing's shadow Hong Kong cabinet, in a concession aimed at breaking the deadlock on the colony's transition to Chinese sovereignty. The concession, outlined in a policy speech to the Legislative Council (LegCo), marks recognition of Beijing's Preliminary Working Committee, set up by China when Sino-British talks on Mr Patten's democratic reform programme broke down in acrimony last year. Until now, the government has been wary of the PWC, which some say could erode the authority of the colonial government, and contacts between the body and Hong Kong civil servants have been limited. Now, PWC members have been invited to share in expert-level talks of the Joint Liaison Group (JLG), the official channel for transitional issues, in a bid to speed negotiations. The JLG's work has decelerated sharply since agreement was reached on the transfer of military land last June. Two big infrastructure projects, a new airport and extension of the port, have already fallen victim to JLG inertia, while local enactment of laws, rights of residency and air services agreements are among the issues remaining on the agenda. Mr Patten said: 'What's of primary concern to us, without being ideological about our relations with the PWC, is how we can give more impetus to the JLG and how, in due course, we can co-operate with the Preparatory Committee (to be established in 1996) and the Chief Executive-designate.' Mr Patten's gesture, however, was shot down by Beijing even before he stood up to speak, with the official Xinhua news agency saying Britain lacked sincerity when it spoke of a desire to improve co-operation and questioning the validity of involving the PWC. Mr Patten said he was surprised by Beijing's statement: 'I thought that's what the PWC is supposed to do,' he said. He further added that Hong Kong people would be puzzled if Beijing failed to provide a positive response to his speech over the coming weeks, saying he was hoping for the best. News of a softer stance on the PWC had already been carried to Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, by Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, when the two met in New York last week. In his speech yesterday, Mr Patten said: 'We have indicated to the Chinese side our willingness to explore further with them whether there are informal ways in which this can be achieved, perhaps by expanding the pool of expertise on which the JLG can draw. Members of the PWC for example may be able to contribute to this process. We would welcome that.' In a further attempt to speed the 'snail's pace' of the JLG work, Mr Patten outlined a raft of issues on which Hong Kong would provide practical aid to the incoming government and related bodies ahead of the transition. These matters span the layers of future government, defence (under the People's Liberation Army after the handover), HKDollars 120bn (Pounds 10bn)-worth of fiscal reserves plus Exchange Fund assets, infrastructure and the 1997 budget.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Stephen Castle and Paul Routledge: "Blair Tops </F> Leadership Poll"]    [Text] Opinion polls published today make Tony Blair the  clear front-runner to succeed John Smith as the contest  threatens to become a classic left-right Labour Party battle.    Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, emerged  yesterday as a likely challenger for the leadership, increasing  the prospect of an ideological battle between the party's  traditionalists and modernisers.    Mr Cook is seriously considering standing for the job left  vacant by Mr Smith's death last week, his allies said. No final  decision will be made before Mr Smith's funeral on Friday.    However polls by ICM [International Communications and  Marketing Research] in today's SUNDAY EXPRESS, by Gallup in THE  SUNDAY TELEGRAPH and a Mori telephone poll in THE SUNDAY TIMES  all make Mr Blair, the shadow home secretary, the public's  favourite to lead Labour.    He has a lead of between 11 and 15 percentage points over  his  closest rivals, John Prescott and Gordon Brown. Mr Blair's lead  is smaller among Labour voters but remains substantial. Mr Cook  is Bottom in every poll -- none gives him more than seven per  cent. They were carried out after Mr Smith's death.    Mr Cook's probable candidature, made known before the polls  were published, ensures at least one candidate from the party's  left when the election takes place, almost certainly in July.  John Prescott, the shadow employment secretary, could be  another: his allies argued yesterday that Mr Cook's early  apparent entry to the race could rebound on him. They can also  point to today's opinion polls which show that Mr Prescott is  far more popular than Mr Cook both among the public and among  committed Labour voters. He is running second to Mr Blair both  among the public at large and among Labour voters.    However, Mr Blair and Mr Brown, the leading contenders from  the right, are looking increasingly reluctant to stand against  each other. Mr Blair's firm lead in today's polls could create  pressure on Mr Brown to stand down. But the shadow chancellor's  supporters insist that he cannot be counted out of the race.    Some modernisers warn that traditionalist Labour members and  trade unionists abhor the media "froth" in favour of Mr Blair.  Under the "one member, one vote" system pushed through by Mr  Smith last year, constituency Labour parties and trade unionists  together make up two thirds of the electoral college.  Supporters of Mr Brown argue that their man might have stronger  backing among the mass membership.    The first signs of a potentially divisive battle began to  emerge yesterday just as the acting leader, Margaret Beckett,  tried to damp down electioneering. She appealed to the leading  potential candidates not to speculate about the succession until  after the European Parliament elections on 9 June. Labour  sources said: "They have all agreed that this must be the case."  But the self denying ordinance -- already under strain -- is  likely to break down after Mr Smith's funeral service in  Edinburgh on Friday.    Mr Brown and Mr Blair have met since Mr Smith's death but  are  unlikely to reach any agreement or pact until next week.    Supporters of both men believe it is vital to present one  strong, modernising candidate who offers greater clarity, more  radicalism and more specific policies than Mr Smith did, while  building on his ability to include all shades of opinion.    Both are aware of the potential threat from Labour's  traditionalists and the left, who were brought back into the  fold by Mr Smith after the battles of the Kinnock years.    Mr Prescott's allies believe that the deputy leadership, now  occupied by Mrs Beckett, could still be contested at the same  time as the leadership. Mrs Beckett would, in any case, be open  to a later challenge at the time of the party conference in  October. However, the trade unions, who finance most of the  estimated 1.5m pound cost of the election, are unlikely to want  two separate contests, Mr Prescott's allies said.    That could revive talk of a Blair/Prescott dream ticket,  earlier dismissed when it became clear that a July contest was  the widespread wish of the party. Some senior Labour figures  argue that Mrs Beckett could secure her position as deputy  leader if she decided not to stand for the leadership.</p>

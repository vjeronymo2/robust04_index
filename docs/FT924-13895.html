			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / International Company News: Campbell launches bid for Arnotts CAMPBELL Soup, the US foodmaker, yesterday launched a surprise ADollars 8.80 a share offer for Arnotts, the Australian biscuit maker, in which it holds a 32.9 per cent stake. Campbell, which has a sizeable biscuit and bakery division in the US where it manufactures the 'Pepperidge Farm' brand, said its objective was to secure control of Arnotts by acquiring a further 17.2 per cent of the shares at a cost of ADollars 209m (Dollars 149.20). However, the group said it was prepared to move to 100 per cent control at a cost of ADollars 943m. The offer, which is subject to approval by the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB), values Arnotts at ADollars 1.2bn. Campbell already has FIRB approval to acquire up to 40 per cent of Arnotts. Arnotts, which was informed of the offer only minutes before it was announced by the Australian Stock Exchange, advised shareholders to take no action until after a scheduled board meeting tomorrow. Schroders Australia, the investment bank appointed to advise the Arnotts' board, said the offer was 'not nearly good enough' to secure control of the group's large range of premium brands. 'I would have thought a first shot across the bows would have been in the region of ADollars 12,' said Mr Paul Binstead, a director of Schroders' investment banking division. Analysts said the small premium over Arnotts' closing share price of ADollars 8 suggested Campbell was testing the market, possibly to flush out potential rival bidders such as Pacific Dunlop, the diversified Australian manufacturer, or United Biscuits of the UK. Mr David Johnson, Campbell's chief executive and himself an Australian, said the offer was 'a logical extension' of the technical and marketing relationship between the companies, which began in 1985 when Campbell helped Arnotts resist a bid by Mr Alan Bond. 'We are sharing high-value ideas, technology, and know-how with Arnotts. We need majority ownership to justify sharing of our proprietary assets,' he told the Arnotts board in a letter. Campbell had started to buy shares in Arnotts in 1984, and pointed out yesterday that it was 'invited by the Arnotts board to become a major shareholder in 1985'. Today, Campbell has two representatives on the Arnotts' board. Mr Johnson said Campbell would develop Arnotts' dominant position in Australia and help it increase sales in Asia, widely seen as a potentially lucrative market for Australian food manufacturers. Arnotts', he indicated, would become Campbell's 'pan-regional brand' in Asia, and could utilise the US food company's sales and distribution network in the region. The US company's existing biscuit and bakery division had sales in the year to August of Dollars 808.6m and operating profits of Dollars 90.6m. 'The world food and biscuit industry is becoming increasingly globalised. Arnotts needs a global partner to help it take advantage of new opportunities,' he said. Campbell said Arnotts would remain a stand-alone company run by its current management team. Analysts said this was probably an attempt to deflect criticism of the sale of the company's well known brand names to an overseas owner. The offer is the fourth big development in the Australasian food market in little more than a year. In the earlier deals, Pacific Dunlop acquired Petersville Sleigh from the collapsed Adsteam group last year, while Goodman Fielder Wattie sold its Wattie offshoot in New Zealand to Heinz of the US for ADollars 428m and bought the Uncle Toby's group in Australia for ADollars 330m.</p>

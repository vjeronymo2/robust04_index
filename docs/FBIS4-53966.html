			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Antonio Kamiya] </F>   [Text] Washington, May 24 KYODO -- Japan and the United  States wound up four days of exploratory talks in the early  hours of Tuesday and appeared to break a three-month deadlock  over their bilateral trade framework.    While both Japanese and U.S. sources said negotiators have  hammered out a compromise arrangement that would allow the two  countries to resume the stalled framework talks, officials  involved in the negotiations would not confirm a deal is in  place.    "There will be a statement tomorrow," said Bowman Cutter,  deputy director of the White House National Economic Council,  after emerging from the negotiating session which ran past  midnight.    Cutter declined to make any further comments, refusing even  to confirm that the four days of closed door negotiations are  over.    Japanese negotiators were equally reticent.    Asked whether the four days of talks have been wrapped up,  Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi responded, "I wish so."    At stake is the fate of the so-called "framework" accord, a  set of formal market-opening negotiations the two countries  launched last July but which collapsed in February at a  Washington meeting between President Bill Clinton and then  Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    Shortly after Japan's new premier, Tsutomu Hata, came to  office in late April, he and Clinton agreed to seek a common  basis for resuming the trade talks before they meet at the Group  of Seven summit in Naples in early July.    The key points of the settlement on Monday, according to  Japanese sources, included a U.S. commitment not to use  numerical targets as "objective criteria" in measuring progress  of imports to Japan.    Another U.S. commitment, the sources said, is to refrain  from  using trade sanctions as a means of enforcing  "objective-criteria" yardsticks to be set in each of the  industry sectors covered by the framework agreement.    Japanese sources said the two sides also agreed to continue  informal talks to work out the objective criteria to be used for  the "priority" industry areas under the framework -- Japanese  Government procurement of medical and telecommunications  equipment, autos and auto parts, and insurance business.    In what could be a source of future disputes, the U.S.  side of the negotiating table appeared to emphasize that the  settlement clinched Monday embodies the "results-oriented" trade  policy championed by the Clinton administration.    According to U.S. press reports, the deal includes a formal  acceptance by the Japanese Government that "measurable results"  will be a gauge for measuring whether the Japanese market is  really open to foreign nations.    In return, the United States will assure Japan in writing  that it will not rely solely on "numerical targets" to determine  progress on trade issues, THE WASHINGTON POST reported in early  editions Tuesday.    At the heart of the controversy, as both Japanese and U.S.  officials have freely admitted, is "a lack of trust" between the  two countries when it comes to bilateral trade issues.    Japan is committed under the framework accord to  significantly reduce its global trade surplus by boosting  domestic demand and opening its market wider to U.S. and other  foreign goods.    Yet, the Japanese surplus has kept on snowballing, hitting a  record 130 billion dollars last year.</p>

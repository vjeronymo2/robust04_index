			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Money Markets: French rates rise EUROPEAN money market dealing yesterday got off to a lively start after the New Year holiday, with many traders trying to work out the Bundesbank's intentions for monetary policy, writes James Blitz. As expected, the return to full trading was accompanied by renewed pressure on the French franc and the Irish punt inside the European exchange rate mechanism. Both currencies came under speculative pressure, and there were sharp rises in their cash rates. In the early morning, trading across Europe was quite bullish, and some London-based dealers even wondered whether the March short-dated sterling contract might break through the 93.50 barrier following the UK prime minister's weekend comment that sterling would not return to the ERM this year. That bullish sentiment was broken later in the morning by the Bundesbank's announce-ment that it will hold a securities repurchase tender at variable rates for 15-days and 29-days today. In recent months, the Bundesbank has restricted itself to issuing two-week repos to give itself greater flexibility. A strong view in the market was that the longer duration of today's repo has scotched any hopes that the Bundesbank would cut rates at this week's council meeting. 'Why invite offers to tie up funds for nearly a month if they are planning to cut rates this week?' asked one dealer. However, one analyst suggested that the 29-day repo could be a convenient excuse for bringing the Bundesbank's repurchase rate down to the lower levels in the money market periods. Both two and three-month money were trading yesterday as low as 8.65 per cent. The news had a negative effect on the March Euromark contract, pushing it down 6 basis points from its opening level to a low of 92.18. It later picked up to close at 92.20. The March French franc contract was worse hit, because the news helped to weaken the French franc to FFr3.419 per D-Mark. The contract tumbled 35 basis points to a low of 90.38 before finishing at 90.48. French cash rates firmed sharply yesterday, with overnight rates seen as high as 13 1/2 per cent at one stage, and closing at around 12 per cent. In the sterling market, three-month money ended unchanged at 7 1/16 per cent.</p>

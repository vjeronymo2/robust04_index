			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, May 5 (AFP) -- European Trade Commissioner  Sir Leon Brittan will this week renew calls for the total  closure of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant during a visit to  Ukraine, a spokesman said Thursday [5 May].    The spokesman said Brittan, due in Ukraine Thursday and  Friday, will stress the urgent need to close the facility, the  site of the world's worst civilian nuclear accident, in April  1986.    In Paris, French Environment Minister Michel Barnier said  Thursday his government would submit a proposal to its European  Union [EU] allies within 10 days for a concrete timetable for  closing the two reactors still operating at the plant.    Barnier said France would seek approval for the project from  both the EU and delegates at the G7 summit of leading  industrialised nations in Naples in July.    Both he and the European Commission spokesman stressed the  need to help ensure Ukraine has stable alternative sources of  energy.    Western nuclear energy experts believe Chernobyl could fall  victim to a second disaster if the plant is not shut down.    Energy-starved Ukraine says Chernobyl provides seven percent  of the former Soviet republic's electricity and that it would  need three billion dollars in financial compensation for  shutting it down.</p>

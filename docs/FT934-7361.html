			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (6): Diagnoses in conflict - A prominent consultant sees gloom. A prominent park developer disagrees TAKE-UP ON business parks has collapsed by 75 per cent since the the late 1980s, says property consultant DTZ Debenham Thorpe. Its study of parks, published earlier this year, shows that investment deals formed less than 1 per cent of the property market last year, compared with 12 per cent in 1990; and that development is running at a mere third of peak levels. As head of Arlington Securities, Britain's biggest park developer, Patrick Deigman might be expected to be discouraged. However, his company has nearly a dozen projects under way, with more than 5.5m sq ft still to be built. Beyond these sit more than 20m sq ft in the pipeline. Even so, the company set alarm bells ringing around the market recently by laying off staff. But the statistics are incorrect, insists Mr Deigman. There had never been a tidal wave of potential development. A crowd of no-hopers had jumped on the bandwagon during the boom. The lay-offs were not a sign of falling business, but part of an internal reorganisation under which property investments were transferred to the British Aerospace parent company, he says. 'We should clock up more than 1m sq ft this year,' says Mr Deigman. Institutions are also falling over themselves to diversify out of city centre holdings, he adds, forecasting yields under 7.5 per cent by the end of the year. 'We get a letting every month or two, and intend to restart development next year,' says Philip Wakeling, who looks after Colchester Business Park for GRE. But rents are down from 14 to 10 a sq ft, and nothing will be built without a pre-let. DTZ Debenham Thorpe says that business parks have fallen into an even bigger black hole than the notorious City of London office market since 1988. Yet Paul Lunn, of Applied Property Research, which provided the basic statistics, is busy stripping out developments which have no chance of going ahead or boast dubious claims to business park status. This could cut supply by 40 per cent. Even that figure will be debatable, however, as no one can agree on how to define a business park. Some analysts refuse to acknowledge any scheme that includes manufacturing or warehouses, which is ironic, considering that a new generation of parks now on the drawing board will contain the whole spectrum of business activity - and maybe even housing. Others set a minimum of 100 acres for the 'true' park, ignoring the fact that some of the most successful schemes over the last decade are much smaller. Even the much-reduced total still leaves what appears to be a vast over-capacity, however. Business parks flourished in the 1980s, because tenants were either squeezed out of town centres by soaring rents or buoyant enough to take swish new premises on greenfield locations. Today, neither of these pressures seems to apply. Wrong again, says Mr Deigman. Firstly, recession makes businesses look hard at costs, and discover that property makes up little more than 5 per cent of bills. People are the big expense, and moving them to a more efficient environment can raise productivity. He quotes KPMG, which has just decided to centralise its Oxford and Reading offices in 30,000 sq ft at Theale, near Reading. The rent is likely to be around Pounds 24 a sq ft, compared with town-centre level of Pounds 15. This kind of letting will be vital in future, says DTZ. Business parks have to grab a larger slice of total demand or widen their appeal to include town-centre tenants. Some are much better placed than others to do this. 'Business parks reflect the health of their local region,' says John Heawood, of DTZ. 'This is inevitable, as 80 per cent of tenants move no more than 20 miles.' Trafalgar House, for instance, has picked up two of the largest deals ever seen on a business park through local moves. At Brooklands, in Weybridge, Surrey, both Sony and Procter &amp; Gamble are building huge new headquarters only a few miles from their old homes. Both also bought freehold sites to create bespoke buildings, which is now about the only activity taking place in the sector, as developers have stopped speculative building. Even the best locations will fail unless they can offer accessibility and amenity, however. Tenants surveyed by Weatherall Green &amp; Smith gave road links and parking as main reasons for selecting accommodation - far above air conditioning or landscaping.</p>

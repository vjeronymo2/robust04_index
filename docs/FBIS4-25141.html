			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "China, ROK Sign Pacts To Promote </F> Cooperation"]    [Text] China and the Republic of Korea (ROK) yesterday  signed high-profile agreements on industrial cooperation.    The two countries plan to join efforts especially in the  production of auto spare parts and television sets, as well as  the development of civil aviation and programme-controlled  switch system technologies.    The event in Beijing was hailed by South Korean officials as  a crucial part of what they billed as the "Kim-Jiang Vision" of  bilateral economic collaboration.    The vision took shape late last year when Chinese President  Jiang Zemin and ROK President Kim Yong-sam met at the summit of  Asia-Pacific nations in the United States city of Seattle.    And during Kim's visit to China in March, the two  governments  agreed to set up the Sino-ROK Industrial Co-operative Committee,  which seeks mutual benefit from each other's industrial  priorities.    The agreement was signed by Wang Zhongyu, Minister of the  State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC), and Hwang Pyong-tae,  the ROK Ambassador to China.    SETC is responsible for the macro development of China's  industries.    Wang will lead Chinese officials from nine ministries to  Seoul later this month to attend the first session of the  cooperative committee.    A memorandum on civil aviation technical cooperation between  the two governments was also signed in Beijing yesterday.    Hwang Pyong-tae said the new agreements would help diversify  bilateral economic co-operation, which has largely been focused  on trade only.    The Republic of Korea's industrial giants like Hyundai,  Posco, Daewoo, Goldstar, and Samsung have begun direct  investments in China in the last few years. ROK investors are  particularly interested in carving off a slice of the Chinese  automotive, steel, electronics and telecommunications markets.    Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing said yesterday that the two  nations should promote co-operation in industrial development,  production and sales in a wide range of sectors.    SETC officials said the two economies are complementary, and  enjoy good prospects for further co-operation.</p>

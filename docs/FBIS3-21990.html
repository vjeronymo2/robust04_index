			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Police headquarters in Belmopan has launched a top  flight investigation into the activities of its Belize City  Special Branch Squad after discovering more than ten kilos of  confiscated cocaine worth more than $350,000 on the black  market, missing from its strong vault in Eastern Division  Headquarters.    Reports say the heat is being focused on two veterans of the  Force, both trusted members of Special Branch, who have become  crooked cops.    Police Commissioner Sherman Zuniga Wednesday appointed a top  brass investigative team headed by Assistant Commissioner Ornell  Brooks. The two others are Senior Superintendent Alvan Rowland  and Superintendent Raymond Thimbrell. Two officers who have not  been identified have been detained, and reports say, one or more  arrests are imminent.    Police Commissioner Zuniga has promised he will hold a press  briefing when the investigations are complete.    Police first knew that something was seriously wrong on  Tuesday when a package of 2.1 kilograms of confiscated cocaine  with special police markings to identify it turned up on the  streets of Belize City.    Last Tuesday night the police busted three guys who were  trying to peddle the stuff in front of the Fort George Radisson.  During some intense questioning police learned the name of at  least one officer working with the Crimes Investigation Bureau.    The investigation has been expanded to include the police  Sergeant in charge of the Police strong room where confiscated  drugs are kept under lock and key.    The Police image has been tarnished time after time by  crooked cops who commit crimes and get off with just a rap on  the wrist. This time however there is every indication that  Police Commissioner Sherman Zuniga will press criminal charges  which could lead to extended jail sentences for the guilty  officers.</p>

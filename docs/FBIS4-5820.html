			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Cause of Libyan People Cannot Be Obliterated"--KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 14 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today in  a signed article on the lapse of 8 years since the United States  Bombed Libya says the United States cannot bring the Libyan  people to their knees with any move.    The article goes on:    The brutal bombing raid on Libya by the United States in  April 1986 brought to light the heinous nature of the United  States which is committing undisguised terrorism under the  pretext of "anti- terrorism".    The Libyan people are waging a brave struggle to consolidate  the independence of the country and defend sovereignty against  the aggression and intervention moves of the United States under  the banner of anti-imperialist independence. Disliking this,  the United States is taking issue with this country in a  far-fetched way to find a pretext for new aggression and  intervention. The U.S. vicious anti-Libya campaign is part of  the systematic schemings to bring this country to its knees and  turn the situation in this region in favour of the execution of  its Africa policy.    Today the Libyan people are heightening vigilance against a  possible new provocation of the United States.    The Korean people are extending firm solidarity for the  Libyan people in their struggle to smash the threat and blockade  moves of the imperialists and defend the national dignity and  sovereignty.    The United States must stop its anti-Libya campaign.</p>

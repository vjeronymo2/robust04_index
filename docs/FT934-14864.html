			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / UK Company News: US and Japanese shortfalls leave Densitron at Pounds 0.25m SHARES IN Densitron International fell 5p to 32p yesterday after the electronic components manufacturer reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 370,000 to Pounds 251,000 in the first half of 1993. Mr Cliff Hardcastle, chairman, said all parts of the company were trading profitably, although there were reduced profits in the US and Japan. The Japanese situation, in particular, was expected to improve rapidly in the second half. Orders and sales were already showing an improvement which, if continued, would help towards a satisfactory outcome for the full year, he added. An improved second half - similar to last year - was expected, but the final outcome was dependent upon relatively large contracts deliverable in the last quarter. Mr Hardcastle pointed out that currency changes had made a significant impact on the reported figures, with the result that the indicated increases in overhead costs and sales were overstated. First-half turnover rose from Pounds 23.4m to Pounds 28m, but after eliminating the effect of currency changes, sales volume remained level, with a small reduction in gross margin. A tax credit of Pounds 17,000 (Pounds 166,000 charge) - the result of higher UK profits being sheltered from tax by prior years' losses and lower earnings abroad - meant earnings per share were higher at 1.12p (0.8p). An increased interim dividend of 0.5p (0.4p) is declared. Mr Hardcastle reported that Densitron had taken a legal action in the US against a Japanese competitor concerning the misuse of confidential information. Costs of the action were 'quite significant', he said, but at this time, the company expected to recover all of its costs, plus damages. The case is due to come to court in mid-December.</p>

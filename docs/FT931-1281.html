			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Lasmo Mr Joe Darby, Lasmo's new chief executive, deserves credit for cutting the dividend. Last year's Pounds 80m pay-out, including the write-off of advance corporation tax, was too high for a loss-making company with Pounds 1bn debt. Yet the 2.5 per cent yield on the shares is hard to square with Lasmo's modest growth prospects. That the Markham gas field is now on the block suggests divestment is eating into core assets. With exploration spending cut again this year, Lasmo will be hard-pressed to replace oil now being drilled with new reserves. The Liverpool Bay gas project should deliver good profits in the second half of the decade - assuming the government's energy review does not block the power projects on which it depends. That may limit the downside. In the meantime, Lasmo looks like a high-cost producer without the financial muscle to compete with the best. Without a sustained rise in the oil price, a fresh injection of equity looks the only way to restore financial balance. Raising US preference capital may provide a partial solution. Having disappointed the UK stock market on so many occasions, though, Lasmo cannot count on the real thing.</p>

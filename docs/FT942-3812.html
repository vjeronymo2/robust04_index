			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Quiligotti calls for Pounds 1.5m Quiligotti, the USM-quoted tiles and flooring group, has launched a 1-for-3 rights issue at 15p to raise about Pounds 1.5m net in order to restore its resources following the acquisition of Cristofoli in April. The group also announced reduced pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.53m (Pounds 3.3m) for the year to March 31, and that it had applied for admission to the Official List. In addition, Quiligotti has disposed of its Irish subsidiary, Quiligotti Ireland, to its management for Pounds 1 plus the payment of some intercompany debt. Quiligotti Ireland, which is involved in the contract laying of hard flooring systems, will be appointed as the group's distributor in Ireland. Group turnover for the 12 months amounted to Pounds 12.9m (Pounds 15.2m) including Pounds 1m from acquisitions and Pounds 824,000 (Pounds 1.22m) from discontinued activities. The pre-tax result was after restructuring costs of Pounds 1.03m. Losses per share came through at 1.22p (4.4p). Irrevocable undertakings have already been received to take up 46.6 per cent of the underwritten rights issue of 11.22m new ordinary shares. As anticipated last October, the company intends to consolidate its shares on the basis of one 5p share for every 10 existing 0.5p ordinary shares. Mr Campbell Allan is stepping down as chairman with effect from July 4. He will be succeeded as chairman by Mr Kenneth Hodgson.</p>

The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule change reflects the NASD's determination to temporarily waive the collection of ITS/CAES service fees for November and December 1993. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  Such action has resulted from the positive financial and operational developments experienced in the equities marketplace generally in 1993, including members' increased usage of ITS/CAES. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  The waiver of ITS/CAES service fees for November and December of 1993 will maintain total revenue from ITS/CAES at levels believed to be reasonable in relation to recovery of the development and ongoing operational costs associated with the system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD only is proposing to waive the ITS/CAES service fees; the equipment related charges noted in section A.4. are not being waived for November and December 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See also Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33143 (November 3, 1993), 58 FR 59773. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with and in furtherance of section 15A(b)(5) of the Act. Section 15A(b)(5) requires that the rules of a national securities association provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and other charges among members and issuers and other persons using any facility or system which the association operates or controls. By waiving ITS/CAES service fees for a limited two-month period, the NASD believes that the total fees assessed for ITS/CAES usage by members will remain at levels sufficient to ensure satisfaction of the statutory mandate that these fees be reasonably and equitably allocated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

At any time within 60 days of the filing of such rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Arts: Tirelessly original old master - Records ELLIOTT CARTER was born the day after Olivier Messiaen, but outlives him now in the pinkest of health. Going on 84, he is more prolific than ever, not least because he's laden with commissions: in the serious music world, he is recognised as a tirelessly original old master. Almost any poll of composers would vote him a seminal place in mid-century music. Yet the wider musical public barely knows his name, let alone his works. Where Messiaen's style - grandiose blocks of sound, oracular formulas, stylised birdsong, lusciously poignant harmony - is easily parodied (and many insignificant composers have been doing that straight-faced for years, with some success), the notion of a Carter caricature hardly gets off the ground. Almost any Carter piece is clamorous with 'solo' voices, whether assigned to a pianist's left hand, a whole viola section or a brass ensemble, and in linear terms they betray favourite tics that could easily be mimicked. But Carter's is above all an art of dramatic combination, of striking cogent sparks from collisions - meticulously calculated - between wildly disparate voices; missing that out would leave your parody vacuous, and to imitate it well you would have to be as much a creative musical engineer as him. All the recorded performances under review here - on Sony, the Juilliard's conspectus of his quartets, and, on Virgin, the high-middle Concerto for Orchestra, the serene 1990 Violin Concerto and his latest freehand orchestral experiments - drive the point home to the hilt. It's a happy chance that they should appear simultaneously; for between them they trace Carter's glorious trajectory in an intimate medium (the string quartet, from his revolutionary First to the Augustan radiance of the Fourth) and on a grander concert-scale his progressive relaxation into 'accessible' transparency and grace, without musical compromise. Like his early mentor Charles Ives, Carter is a self-contained original. His later musical education - with Nadia Boulanger in France, and afterwards amid the populist ideals of the New Deal back home - made him a sophisticated American composer with interesting quirks, when there were plenty of others. Just before and after he turned 40, he thought hard, even corrosively, about the formal possibilities of music: which veins were exhausted, and which others might reward strenuous exploration.

His 1946 Piano Sonata announced his first bold findings, and then his Cello Sonata, and some wind-ensemble experiments. Those might be the best textbook-introductions to this composer. In the late 1950s, however, it was Carter's string quartet that travelled the world on records, setting composers' imaginations alight. The crucial new device, which for a time was called 'metrical modulation, was this. One voice could match the others beat for beat, and yet - little by little - come to stress beats at different distances, so as to establish a new metre of its own. More ingeniously, it might subdivide the common pulse in asymmetrical proportions (7-to-the-beat, say, against 5 or 4) and then begin to fix the downbeat in new places, challenging what the other voices strove to maintain. As Carter realised, the result could be ambiguous and tantalising, or equally make a strong, disorienting transition. At either extreme it can generate fraught musical drama, and also unbridled solo expression on a loose but still definite rein. His First String Quartet explored those extremes on a visionary scale. My only reservation about the new Juilliard account is that they are almost too familiar with it, more intent upon making smooth sense - and every note translucent - than enforcing the broader, starkly dramatic effects that first knocked us over. Since the detail is so rich on its own, one can hardly complain. It is good to find, nevertheless, that the Juilliard maintains sharper nerve-end contrasts in the later quartets, where Carter's ordering of his musical elements is more compacted and violent, though no less cogent. (It is also rather moving to learn that the current Juilliard Quartet, sterling as ever, retains only its leader Robert Mann from the teams who gave the first performances of the Second and Third Quartets.) The Fourth Quartet, impassioned but stately, blossoms into noble breadth and depth. It is no accident that it should be a composer, Oliver Knussen, who conducts the orchestral works on the Virgin CD to such incisive and beautiful effect. Practical musicians are the people who are better placed than anybody to appreciate Carter's high-definition writing - and to insist upon performing him, even when the audience won't extend much beyond some cognoscenti. In fact the Three Occasions are immediately appealing. First a witty, intricately clever fanfare, 'A Celebration of some 100x150 Notes' (just what it claims to be); then an elevated trombone elegy, 'Remembrance, with chiaroscuro accompaniment; and 'Anniversary, a rigorously taut - but tautly lyrical - present to his wife upon their golden wedding. As always, Carter fans his inspiration through self-imposed formal challenges, and finds brilliantly natural-sounding solutions. The spare, silvery new Violin Concerto is eloquent, and eloquently delivered by Ole Bohn. Its three shapely movements seem not to include any unabashed climax. In particular, the slow movement - marked 'Tranquillo' for the orchestra, 'Angosciato' (anguished) for the soloist - has the ring of cleanly assured purpose, inversely proportional to anything like distress or disarray. So what? The teeming 1969 Concerto for Orchestra also has too much lithe muscle to register the darker with unambiguous conviction, but it is wonderfully bracing to hear. The great thing about Carter-on-records is that you can repeat it until you know it properly, whereupon its extraordinary strengths become palpable. As with the impacted Third Quartet: it is a continuous set of overlapping 'movements' for string-duos, each heard at least twice against different duo-music, and composed on the patrician assumption that you'll listen to it again and again until you appreciate the identities-in-difference in their distinct lights. And so you should; the eventual rewards will justify a lot of dogged attention. Elliott Carter: String Quartets nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4.  Duo for Violin and Piano.

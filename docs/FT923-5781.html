			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Daf in 'strategic alliance' talks with Mercedes-Benz DAF, the Dutch commercial vehicle maker in which British Aerospace holds a 16 per cent stake, has begun talks on forming a 'strategic alliance' with Mercedes-Benz, the world's leading truck manufacturerr. Daf refused to name Mercedes-Benz as its potential partner yesterday, although Dutch trade union officials have confirmed the talks. However, Daf and Mercedes-Benz, the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial corporation, issued contrasting versions of the talks. The Dutch company, which is suffering its third year of heavy losses, said discussions were 'taking place on a strategic alliance' with an unnamed party which could lead to a 'structural strengthening' of the group. An equity stake was under consideration and the negotiations included talks on exchanging products, co-operation in new product development and sharing of production. Mercedes-Benz, which on Wednesday had denied that any talks were taking place, yesterday admitted that discussions were under way following an approach from Daf. The German company insisted that there was no question of 'concrete negotiations' with the aim of Mercedes-Benz either acquiring a minority shareholding or even taking over Daf. It said that the talks, which had been initiated by Daf and which had been under way 'for some time', concerned the creation of a 'customer-supplier relationship' between the two companies. Mercedes-Benz dominates the European truck industry and accounted for 32.8 per cent of new truck sales (above 3.5 tonnes) in west Europe last year, compared with the 7.2 per cent taken by Daf. Its main rivals in Europe are the Franco-Swedish alliance of Renault and Volvo, and Iveco, the commercial vehicles subsidiary of Fiat. Despite the two versions of the nature of the negotiations, the disclosure of the talks helped to boost the Daf share price, which has been trading at an all-time low in recent days. The price gained Fl 2.3 to close at Fl 18.1 last night. The share price was also helped by Daf's announcement that it had cut net losses in the first half of the year to Fl 97.4m (Pounds 30.9m) from Fl 179.1m in the corresponding period a year ago. Mr Cor Baan, who took over as chairman of the Daf management board earlier this year, forecast that the group would break even in the second half of 1992. Daf is also understood to be close to reaching agreement with the Dutch and Belgian governments on raising Fl 210m of new finance.

We present the full text of the document and the provisional  statute approved by him:    "For the purposes of ensuring the development of local  self-government in the city of Moscow and the execution by the  city of the functions of the capital of the Russian Federation,  I resolve:    "1. To approve the accompanying provisional statute on the  general principles of the administrative-territorial division  and organization of local self-government in the city of Moscow.    "2.

This edict goes into effect from the day it is  published."  <H3>  Statute on the General Principles of  Administrative-Territorial Division and Organization of Local  Self-Government in the City of Moscow: </H3>   I. General principles of administrative-territorial  division.    1. This provisional statute establishes the general  principles of the administrative-territorial division of the  city of Moscow as a component of the Russian Federation--a city  with federal significance.    2. The system of administrative-territorial division of the  city of Moscow is made up of:    --an administrative okrug;    --a municipal okrug.    3. The administrative okrug is an intracity administrative  unit, a system of organs of authority that is built on the basis  of centralized management. The procedure for managing the  administrative okrug is established by a special statute  approved by the mayor of Moscow.    The city of Zelenograd forms a separate administrative  okrug.    The territory of the administrative okrug includes municipal  rayons.    4. The municipal rayon is an administrative-territorial unit  of the city of Moscow within whose borders the self-government  of the population that lives on the given territory is conducted.    Municipal rayons are organized taking into account the  socioeconomic characteristics of pertinent territories, their  town-planning and historical features, and the presence of  residential complexes and objects of the municipal  infrastructure. The boundaries and the names of the municipal  rayons are established by the Moscow City Duma on a  representation of the mayor of the city of Moscow.    The municipal rayon is divided into microrayons  (settlements)  in which organs of territorial public self-government can be  established. The boundaries and names of microrayons are  determined by the organs of self-government of the municipal  rayon.    II. The principles of organization of local  self-government.    5. Local self-government on the territory of the city of  Moscow is conducted on the basis of this provisional statute,  legislation of the Russian Federation, and the normative acts of  the city of Moscow, taking into account its status as the  capital of the Russian Federation.    6. The organs of local self-government in the city of Moscow  are municipalities that include assemblies of representatives of  the population of the municipal rayon (municipal assemblies) and  the head of the local administration (head of the municipality).    III. Local administration.    7. The activity of the local administration is directed by  the head of the municipality, who carries out the management of  the municipal economy and property, develops the estimate of  incomes and expenditures, ensures its implementation, and  performs other executive-administrative functions.    8. The head of the municipality is appointed in coordination  with the municipal assembly by the mayor of Moscow from the  number of candidates recommended by the prefect of the  administrative okrug.    In the event of nonconcurrence by a majority of the members  of the municipal assembly in the candidacy proposed for the  position of the head of the municipality, the mayor has the  right to resubmit this candidacy or propose another one.    Given the nonconcurrence of a majority of the members of the  municipal assembly in the proposed candidacy in this case as  well, within a two-week period the mayor of Moscow appoints an  acting head of the municipality for a period of one year. The  indicated person enjoys all of the rights and carries all of the  responsibilities of the head of a municipality.    The head of the municipality cannot engage in other paid  activity, except for teaching, scientific, and other creative  activity.    9. The head of the municipality, in the event of a  systematic  nonfulfillment of his duties or their gross violation, can be  dismissed from the position by the mayor of Moscow, including on  a representation of the prefect of the administrative okrug, or  on the basis of an appeal by the municipal assembly. The  indicated appeal is examined by the mayor within a two-week  period.    10. The head of the municipality issues instructions on  questions of his own jurisdiction established by legislation of  the Russian Federation and normative acts of the city of Moscow.    11. The administration of the city and the municipal  assembly  have a right to exercise control over the activity of the head  of the municipality in a procedure stipulated by legislation of  the Russian Federation and normative acts of the city of Moscow.    12. The procedure for dismissal of the head of the  municipality and the appointment to the position and dismissal  from the position of his deputies is established by the mayor of  Moscow.    IV. Municipal assembly.    13. The assembly of representatives of the population of a  municipal rayon (municipal assembly) consists of five to seven  municipal councillors elected according to territorial election  okrugs for a period of two years on the basis of general equal  and direct elections in secret voting.    The procedure of elections to the municipal assembly and the  number of municipal councillors are established by the Moscow  City Duma on the recommendation of the mayor of Moscow.    14. The municipal assembly is convened by the head of the  municipality, who heads the municipal assembly, no less than  once a quarter to consider drafts of decisions proposed to him  on the following questions:    --approval of estimates of incomes and expenditures and a  report on their execution;    --approval of the annual program (plan) of socioeconomic  development and building of the territory and a review of the  report on its execution;    --approval of the procedure for managing municipal property;    --examination of other questions relating to the conduct of  the municipal assembly.    15. The municipal assembly can be convened at the initiative  of the Moscow City Duma, the mayor of Moscow, or by no less that  two-thirds of the municipal councillors, but not more than twice  a year.    16. The municipal assembly has the right to exercise control  functions, including control over the activity of the head of  the municipality and over the procedure for using tracts of land  and municipal property.    17. The municipal assembly is competent to make decisions if  more than half of the municipal councillors are present at its  meeting. Decisions are adopted by a majority of the municipal  councillors attending the meeting and are signed by the head of  the municipality, except decisions about appealing to the mayor  of Moscow on the question of dismissing the head of the  municipality from his position.    18. Decisions of the municipal assembly that are adopted  within the scope of its jurisdiction are obligatory for  implementation by all enterprises, institutions, organizations,  organs of public territorial self-government, and citizens  located on the pertinent territory.    In the event that a decision of the municipal assembly  contradicts legislation of the Russian Federation and normative  acts of the city of Moscow, or affects the interests of the city  as a whole, it can be suspended by the mayor of Moscow or  official authorized by him.    19. The municipal assembly can be dissolved by the Moscow  City Duma in cases established by legislation of the Russian  Federation, and also as a result of the conduct of a local  referendum on confidence in the assembly. The municipal assembly  can adopt a decision on early dissolution.    The elections of municipal councillors must be held not  later  than three months from the date of the corresponding adoption by  the Moscow City Duma of a decision on the dissolution of the  municipal assembly, the announcement of the results of a  referendum, or the adoption of a decision on self-dissolution.    V. Territorial Public Self-Government.    20. The population of microrayons (settlements), and also of  streets, blocks, and homes, can establish organs of territorial  public self-government acting in accordance with legislation of  the Russian Federation and the normative acts of the city of  Moscow.    21. The procedure for the formation of public  self-government  is established by the municipal assembly on a recommendation of  the head of the municipality in accordance with the standard  statute on organs of territorial public self-government approved  by the Moscow City Duma according to the written statement of  the mayor of Moscow.    VI. Transitional Statutes    22. The periods and stages of the conduct of reform of the  local self-government in the city of Moscow are established by  the Moscow City Duma on a representation of the mayor of Moscow.    23. Before the adoption of the statute of the city of  Moscow,  peculiarities in the management of municipal property, including  the procedure for submitting it to the management of the  municipal rayons and associations in the interests of the  residents of the entire city and its individual parts, are  established by the Moscow City Duma on the recommendation of the  mayor of Moscow.    24. Before the adoption of the statute of the city of  Moscow,  the procedure for the formation of estimates of incomes and  expenditures of the municipal rayons is established by the  Moscow City Duma on the recommendation of the mayor of Moscow.  Before the creation of the necessary conditions for the  formation and execution of local budgets, the formation and  execution of a unified city budget, with an allocation of  financial resources for the municipal rayons, is allowed.</p>

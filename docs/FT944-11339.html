			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / People (Names in the News): Ohga collects another award Norio Ohga, 63, the colourful president and chief executive of Sony, is about to collect another award - and this time not for his piano playing, writes William Dawkins. George Washington University has named him as its first international chief executive of the year. The fact that Ohga's talents are not just limited to business is an 'inspiration to business leaders around the world', says David Fowler, the dean. Ohga learnt to play the piano at the age of seven, studied music in Munich and Berlin, and had started a career as an opera singer when he was spotted by Akio Morita, Sony's founder. Since then, the baritone has provided the cultural and design input. Ohga is well known in US business circles, having taken a big part in Sony's negotiations to buy CBS Records for Dollars 2bn in 1987 and Columbia Pictures for Dollars 3.4bn in 1989 - the biggest foreign acquisition by a Japanese company. This realised the dream of Ohga and Morita to add software - films and music  -to a consumer electronics hardware making business. That dream has become something of a headache during the recession, but Sony, under Ohga, is sticking to the strategy. The recession certainly has not dented his taste for the grand gesture, as shown when he appeared in New York last year to conduct the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra before a capacity audience. He will content himself in Washington next Friday with giving a speech at the award ceremony.</p>

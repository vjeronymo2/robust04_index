			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Pochin's tumbles to Pounds 1.08m POCHIN'S, the Cheshire-based civil engineer and building contractor, saw pre-tax profits in the six months to November 30 decline from Pounds 1.54m to Pounds 1.08m on turnover down from Pounds 23.3m to Pounds 14.2m. Mr Nicholas Pochin, chairman, said the results were a reflection of the state of the industry. The recession persisted and until incentives were provided to bring back confidence, building and construction would remain stagnant. He added that profits continued to be supported by healthy investment income. The interim dividend is held at 8p from earnings of 73.5p (96p) per share. Tax took Pounds 312,000 (Pounds 540,000).</p>

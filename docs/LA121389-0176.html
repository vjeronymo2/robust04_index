			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> BOXER FIGHTING TO SAVE CAREER  </P> <P> Three-time world boxing champion Jeff Fenech of Australia entered a hospital  today to undergo hand surgery in an attempt to save his career, trainer Johnny  Lewis said.  </P> <P> Fenech, unbeaten in 24 fights and the current World Boxing Council  featherweight champion, has been troubled by painful hands throughout his  career.  </P> <P> He broke bones in both hands during a title defense against Marcos Villasana of  Mexico in April and again injured his right hand last month when outpointing  Mario Martinez of Mexico in a super-featherweight title elimination bout.  </P> <P> Fenech, 25, hopes to fight for a fourth world title early next year. He  previously held the International Boxing Federation bantamweight and WBC  super-bantamweight titles.  </P> <P> Lewis said the operation would involve the lengthening and possible  reconstruction of tendons in Fenech's right fist and would be performed by  specialist Dr. Bruce Shepherd on Thursday.  </P></p>

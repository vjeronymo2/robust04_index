Programs must include the provision of training and/or technical assistance to State staff and/or staff of local service providers nationwide, i.e., in each of the Federal Regions, in the most cost effective manner possible. Collaboration with State CSBG coordinators and local service providers will be required in identifying the training and technical assistance needs of staff of local service providers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Priority 2_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Data Collection: The design of a survey instrument, and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information on FY 1993 CSBG Programs on a nationwide basis through a process that relies on voluntary State cooperation. The information must be comprehensive enough and disseminated in such formats as to enable States and local service providers to improve their planning, management, and delivery of services and to assure that the general public has a clear understanding of those programs and their outcomes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Baldwin restores interim pay-outs Losses at Baldwin, the holidays, printing and properties group, widened from Pounds 2.02m to Pounds 2.25m at the pre-tax level for the half year ended April 30. However, in view of the strong financial position of the group and the current state of trading interim dividends are being restored via a 1.6p payment. The deficit was a direct result of the accounting policy of the tour operating division which recognises revenue only on the departure of customers on holiday. Since virtually all holidays take place in the second six months 'there is little turnover and little profit' from this division at the interim stage. Turnover doubled to Pounds 8.4m and losses per share worked through at 9.03p (7.98p). Cash balances at period end stood at Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 4.5m).</p>

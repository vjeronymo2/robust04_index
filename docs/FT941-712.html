			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Technology: File for patents far and wide - Technically Speaking The recent agreement in the Uruguay Round of the Gatt (general agreement on tariffs and trade) negotiations will have an obvious, positive impact on trade in goods and services. Less clear is the profound effect it will have on intellectual property rights (IPR) and corporate patenting strategies. IPR is likely to change considerably over the next 10 years. Companies that depend on IPR for their business should be filing now for patents in countries that they want to start selling to in the next decade. Otherwise, their future products will have no patent protection in these large emerging markets. IPR will now come under the umbrella of the Gatt (and its successor), pressuring the developing world into creating IPR protection comparable to that today in the countries belonging to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). For many products, patent protection is essential to creating or capturing future value, irrespective of whether the product is imported, manufactured locally under licence, or manufactured by a local subsidiary. Goods and services now produced under licence, mainly in the OECD countries, are estimated at more than Dollars 500bn (Pounds 342.40bn) a year. The total value of goods and services covered by IPR protection is many times larger and these amounts could easily double in real terms over the next 10 years as the developing countries, particularly in Asia, join the market in IPR. Under the Uruguay Round accord there will be a comprehensive and binding agreement on IPR. This includes: Broad cover for all forms of intellectual property in line with currently accepted international standards, including the Paris Convention (patents) and Berne Convention (copyright); Twenty-year minimum patent life from filing date for products and processes; Comprehensive enforcement procedures and dispute settlement mechanisms within Gatt; Protection for commercial and trade secrets when required by governments for use in patent applications or for regulatory approvals. OECD countries will have a one-year transition and mid-level developing countries a further four years. The least developed countries can have up to 11 years in transition but patent applications can be made immediately for pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical products, with patents granted at the end of the transition period. Under the pressures of the trade sanctions that the Gatt can deploy, enforceable patent systems are likely to emerge in a number of less developed countries over the next 10 years. We are seeing today a rapid shift in economic growth from the developed world to the developing world. One view of future growth prospects suggests that world GDP may increase from Dollars 24,000bn in 1990 to Dollars 51,000bn in 2010. A patent filing programme covering the main OECD countries, with a lifetime cost of about Dollars 270,000 (for a single, moderately complex technology) will today cover around 54 per cent of world GDP. By 2010, that same programme would be covering only 38 per cent of world GDP. Yet, by 2010, there are likely to be enforceable IPR laws in the bulk of the remaining 62 per cent. Responding to the imminent changes in the global IPR system may seem a postponable decision, but country analyses of future GDP suggest that patent filing programmes should include more Far Eastern and Latin American countries. Relatively small changes in patent-filing programmes, at quite low cost, could effect the success of technology-based companies in 10 years' time.

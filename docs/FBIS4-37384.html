			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuwait, 19 Jun (KUNA) -- Admiral Sir Benjamin  Bathurst, British chief of the Naval Staff, will arrive here  this evening on a two-day official visit to Kuwait during which  he will discuss the issue of Kuwait's security and the joint  military exercises with the Kuwaiti officials.    The British Embassy in Kuwait said in a statement today, of  which KUNA has received a copy, that this visit is a new model  for the strong ties between the two Navies which have been  strengthened by the principal role played by these forces during  the war to liberate the State of Kuwait.    The embassy added that this visit confirms the United  Kingdom's continued concern for the security of Kuwait.    It pointed out that the visiting admiral will discuss the  continued rounds of joint military exercises between Kuwaiti  military ships and the royal ships of the Armilla Patrol in the  Gulf.    The forthcoming exercises of these forces are scheduled to  take place next September during the visit of HMS Cornwall.    During his visit, Admiral Bathurst will meet with Defense  Minister Shaykh Ahmad al-Hamud, General 'Ali Mu'min, chief of  the general staff, and Dr. Hamud al-'Utaybi, under secretary at  the Defense Ministry.    Admiral Bathurst will also meet with Commander Muhammad  Yaqut  al-Fayruz, deputy-commander of the Kuwaiti Navy, during his  visit to the naval base in al-Julay'ah.    It is worth mentioning that the United States, Britain,  France, and Russia have signed defense agreements with Kuwait  since the end of the war to liberate the State of Kuwait in  February 1991.</p>

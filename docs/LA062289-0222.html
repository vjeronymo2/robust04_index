			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOMINO'S DRIVERS UNDER 18 FIRED AFTER RASH OF ACCIDENTS  </P> <P> Domino's Pizza Inc., under criticism for a series of fatal traffic accidents  involving its delivery drivers, has told its stores to fire or reassign drivers  who are under the age of 18, a spokesman said today.  </P> <P> Domino's spokesman Ron Hingst said federal law prohibited the company from  hiring drivers younger than 18, but in some cases people hired for other tasks  have ended up delivering pizzas.  </P> <P> The new order will affect about 300 employees at Domino's company-owned stores,  about one-third of the Domino's 5,000 stores nationally, he said. The franchise  stores are being urged to make the same move.  </P> <P> The company's directive led to confusion at a Miami Domino's store that gave  pink slips to all its under-18 employees Wednesday. Those under 18 who do not  drive were rehired later that day, the company stated.  </P></p>

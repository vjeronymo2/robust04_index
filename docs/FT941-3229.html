			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Ministers seek to calm Tory fears on IRA The government is preparing a charm offensive aimed at reassuring Conservative backbenchers about its Northern Ireland policy in the wake of recent terrorist attacks. Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland minister, is offering to meet Tory MPs with specific concerns about the province individually or in small groups from next week. Many Conservatives are keen to add their weight to mounting unionist calls for a security clampdown in response to the latest surge in mainland terrorism by the IRA. They are understood to be disappointed with the government's response to date. A top-level committee of cabinet ministers met secretly at Westminster this week to discuss the security situation. The Northern Ireland Office is thought, however, to be reluctant to countenance radical new counter-terrorist measures at such a delicate point in the Anglo-Irish peace initiative. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, will have a fresh opportunity to gauge the strength of backbench feeling today, when he meets the generally pro-unionist officers of the Tory backbench Northern Ireland committee. This routine get-together will come immediately after Northern Ireland questions in the Commons, when members of the opposition parties will grill Sir Patrick on recent events. The backbench Northern Ireland committee will meet at Westminster later in the afternoon, after which it is thought MPs might press for a meeting with Mr John Major, the prime minister. Meanwhile, the cross-party Commons selection committee expects to decide next week which MPs are to sit on the new Northern Ireland select committee in a move which could pave the way for the body to start work soon after Easter. The decision to set up the select committee is widely seen as a reinforcement of the government's commitment to the province's unionist majority.</p>

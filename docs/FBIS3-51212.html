			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Joe Alberto Briceno] </F>   [Text] Actions by the large American countries, headed by  the United States, were stepped up on 10 January to expedite the  official announcement of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria's  candidacy to the post of OAS secretary general, diplomatic  sources have reported. Those sources have even said that in  Washington the United States, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, and  Brazil--the main promoters of Gaviria's candidacy--are the ones  lobbying the most with other diplomatic representations to  obtain the votes the Colombian president needs.    The sources have underscored that the United States does not  want Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus to head the OAS,  because, according to them, he does not meet the necessary  conditions.    The North Americans want a statesman to head the  organization, because they expect this will be the means to get  their inter-American policy implemented with more multinational  criteria, just as has been cited by Bill Clinton's  administration.    According to news agencies, the State Department has already  obtained the support of Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru, and Bolivia  for Gaviria's candidacy. Chilean Foreign Minister Enrique Silva  Cimma has said his government views this candidacy with much  interest, although President-elect Eduardo Frei will have to  make the decision.    Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon has said there  will be "a hard confrontation with Colombia" if Gaviria  formalizes his candidacy. He also reiterated that efforts will  continue to unite all the small countries on the continent and  elect the Central American and Caribbean representative.    Luis Guardia, the Costa Rican ambassador at the OAS, has  told  LA REPUBLICA that only Peru had advanced its backing to the  Colombian in Washington and that this was not surprising,  "because Costa Rica was the first country to protest after  President Alberto Fujimori broke the constitutional order."    The Peruvian president has said his country supported  strongly the Colombian nominee, and he said Gaviria is a  statesman who also has a good integrationist spirit.    Guardia has explained that the 13 Caribbean countries have  confirmed their support for Niehaus' candidacy and will maintain  it if Central America "does not separate."    In talks with U.S. officials, Guardia has requested "they  not  take sides yet" and that, as has been their tradition, they not  announce their choice until the end. Likewise, he has stressed  the importance of respecting the management rotation principle,  which prevails in Washington-based institutions, such as in the  Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the Pan-American  Health Organization.    Until now the Costa Rican minister has maintained the  support  of the 13 Caribbean and six isthmian states, as well as the  Dominican Republic, Chile, Ecuador, and Argentina. The latter  two seem to have modified their positions, however, according to  reports coming from Santa Fe de Bogota.    Niehaus has said much speculation has been reported to stop  the regional option, but he said: "We have a comfortable  majority, and I am sure President Gaviria will think twice  before making his candidacy official." He has charged that  certain big countries consider they are "first category"  countries and that small countries are "second category" ones  and thus unable to manage inter-American forums.    Niehaus believes this attitude violates international law.  He has added that the 28 March election will reflect if  regulations will be respected or slighted.</p>

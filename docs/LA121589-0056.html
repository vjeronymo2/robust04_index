			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Hollywood Memorabilia Up for Grabs: Ever wanted to dress up as Judah Ben-Hur  facing off against Rome's greatest charioteers in the Colosseum? If so, put in  your bid this afternoon to Sotheby's in New York, which is offering these and  59 other items in a special auction of Hollywood memorabilia. Among the more  talked-about pieces on the block at 2 p.m. today are a red sequined evening  gown worn by Marilyn Monroe in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" (expected to fetch  $8,000 to $12,000), a bowler hat worn by Charlie Chaplin while filming "City  Lights" ($6,000 to $8,000) and Judy Garland's blue-and-white cotton dress in  "The Wizard of Oz" ($20,000 to $25,000). Also to be auctioned is the  17-by-37-foot backdrop used by Alfred Hitchcock in his 1945 film, "Spellbound."  The massive painting, designed by surrealist Salvador Dali, is expected to  bring the auction's top price: an estimated $80,000. SHAUNA SNOW  </P></p>

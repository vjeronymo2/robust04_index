			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Opec close to deal on output cuts and support for prices AN AGREEMENT by ministers of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut output in the second quarter of the year and shore up oil prices was believed to be close last night. The ministers, meeting in Vienna, were making 'very satisfactory progress', according to Mr Alirio Parra, the Opec president, who said he expected a final deal today. The talks centre around a Saudi Arabian proposal for members to make pro rata cuts amounting to 1m barrels a day from Opec's first quarter ceiling of 24.58m b/d agreed in November. Most delegations have agreed to the cuts, but a decision was being stalled by Kuwait's strong resistance. The Gulf state declared that it was unhappy with the level of cuts that fellow members believe it must make if the cartel is to satisfy the markets. Mr Ali al-Baghli, the Kuwaiti oil minister, last night held a series of bilateral meetings to try to narrow the differences with other Opec members, which have been exerting pressure on the emirate to agree to cut production in proportion with themselves. The Saudi formula would, if the cartel were to show uncharacteristic discipline and obey its own ceiling, actually take nearer to 1.5m b/d off the oil market, given that most estimates by the industry put Opec output for the present quarter at more than 25m b/d. To attain that, members would be expected to cut output pro rata from their production figures of November last year. At that point Kuwait was lifting around 1.5m b/d. The Gulf state, however, has insisted that it did not receive a quota as such in November and anyway should be regarded as a special case while it is still rebuilding after the damage done by the Gulf war. Kuwiat claims its present production to be around 1.98m b/d which would rise to 2.1m b/d in the second quarter, and wants any cuts to be considered only from this level. Other delegations, and many industry specialists, believe a present Kuwaiti production figure of around 1.7-1.8m b/d to be more credible. Some delegations, including Saudi Arabia, argue that Opec cannot deliver a believable output cut while allowing Kuwait such leeway. The kingdom itself is refusing to cut its production below 8m b/d from its present 8.4m b/d. In addition, patience has worn thin among other delegations for Kuwait's call for special treatment. 'Every country has got economic problems,' said one Nigerian delegate. 'The fact that we did not have a war does not mean we don't have economic problems.' Neither do many Opec countries want to make too much of a precedent for special treatment with the prospect of Iraq's re-entry on to the oil market looming, albeit fairly distantly, on the horizon. Anything less than a unanimous agreement to cut production to somewhere near 23.5m b/d, and corresponding discipline in meeting the target, is likely to disappoint the markets, which have built between Dollars 1.50 and Dollars 2 into the price of crude before this weekend's meeting on the back of apparent consensus to cut at least 1m b/d from the November ceiling. By late yesterday, however, 23.5m b/d looked an optimistic target, with some members suggesting that Kuwait might at the outside be accommodated at a production level of perhaps 1.6m b/d or slightly more  - which, if accepted, would already represent leakage on the November Opec ceiling. Some Gulf Arab delegations suggested the final agreement might be closer to a ceiling of 23.6-23.7m b/d.</p>

			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / BBC forced to curb its own adverts such as the Radio Times - with glossy television commercials, because it distorts the market. In future, the government has decided, the corporation can give only basic information - such as the title price and availability of a magazine - over a still slide at the end of programmes. In addition, the BBC will also have to mention the availability of competing magazines. Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said yesterday that he would be asking Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, to seek an undertaking from the BBC on the issue. Mr Hamilton acted as the Monopolies and Mergers Commission published a report on the publicising of goods supplied by broadcasters. The BBC said yesterday that it would be expressing its concern over the idea that it should have to promote non-BBC magazines. The MMC investigation, set up as a result of the Sadler report into cross-media promotion, found that it was only in the consumer magazine market that BBC promotion distorted competition. The MMC decided that BBC use of air time to promote its magazines had distorted competition in the food and cookery sectors. There was also distortion in listings and gardening, but that did not have such adverse effects. The MMC came out against moving trails - videos lasting up to 40 seconds - because they were more likely to contain 'elements of persuasion, overt endorsement and selling'. It said mentions of magazines in programmes should also be prohibited because of the likely adverse effect on competition. The MMC had suggested that if the BBC and the Independent Television Commission came up with a code of practice acceptable to the Office of Fair Trading, that should be substituted for its recommendations. However, Mr Hamilton rejected that alternative and ruled that moving trails and mentions during programmes should be banned. Mr Hamilton said: 'I believe these to be important additional safeguards which, when taken together with the MMC's recommendations, will help prevent future distortion of the market.'

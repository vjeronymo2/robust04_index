			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Zhong Pengrong, director and researcher of </F> the Beijing Jinsida Economic Planning Center, by staff reporter  Gao Shangang (7559 0810 4993); place and date not given:  "Curbing Inflation Requires Quicker Reform--Interview With  Young Economist Zhong Pengrong"]    [Text] Zhong Pengrong, 39, is now director and researcher  of the Beijing Jinsida Economic Planning Center. In 1987, he  published an article "Reforming the Investment Structure  According to the Requirements of the Commodity Economy" in  JINGJI RIBAO, and his opinions attracted the attention of the  central leaders. He was later transferred to the Central  General Office to do investigation and research work. In 1992,  he published an article "Socialism Also Needs the Market  Economy" (written jointly with Chen Jinyu) in JINGJI RIBAO. The  article was reprinted by RENMIN RIBAO and dozens of national  newspapers. So far, he has published more than 10 books,  including "Studies of Inflation in China" and "On  Macroeconomics," and more than 200 treatises. Recently, his  book "100 Major National Policies" was published by the People's  Publishing House.    [Gao] Price hikes have become an issue which concerns many  people. What is your opinion about the fundamental cause of  price increases in our country?    [Zhong] The price increases have been caused by an excessive  amount of currency in circulation, which in turn has resulted  from excessive loans. Therefore, in order to control commodity  prices, efforts should primarily be made to restrain credit and  limit the amount of currency in circulation.    [Gao] Why has the phenomena of excessive credit appeared so  frequently, and why has it been so difficult for the state to  bring under control?    [Zhong] The fundamental problem is that loans in our country  are being made almost for free. This finds expression in two  ways. First, after a loan is made, the borrower may fail to pay  it back when the debt is due or may never repay it. Second, the  interest rate for the loans is lower than the inflation rate and  is also lower than the average market interest rate. The annual  interest rate of bank loans is around 10 percent, but the  inflation rate in large and medium-sized cities is over 20  percent. In some localities, the interest rate of loans given  by one enterprise to another is as high as 35 percent or more.  Because of these two factors, enterprises and the local  government all want to take out as many loans as possible by  starting new projects. Thus, bank loans have become the most  precious and scarce of resources. Between 80 and 90 percent of  the people who come to the provincial capitals or the national  capital do so for the purpose of obtaining loans. Under strong  pressure from borrowers throughout the country, the credit  limits laid down by the state have been exceeded time and again.  This has inevitably led to inflation.    [Gao] Loans are being made almost for free. This problem  indeed exists to various degrees in our country, and it is a  structural problem. That is to say, the inflation in our  country is not only related to the current policies; instead, it  is the result of the operation of the current structure.  Therefore, the fundamental way to curb inflation is to reform  the current structure.    [Zhong] In restraining inflation, the key lies in the  establishment of a mechanism in the monetary structure which  will prevent loan seekers from contracting endless amounts of  loans and which will prompt them to be more conservative in  taking out loans. Only when they are sure that the expected  profits from the investment or the business project will be  higher than the interest rate of the loan do they dare take the  loan; otherwise, they will refuse to accept the loan even if the  loan is offered to them. The mechanism should also discourage  loan-extenders from offering loans recklessly; only when they  are sure that the debtors can repay the principal with interest  will they offer a loan. Under such a mechanism, there will  appear a new situation in which hundreds of thousands of people  are jointly exercising self-control over the size of loans.    [Gao] The character of the funds is determined by the  characteristics of the financial institutions that provide such  funds. If the financial institutions are not enterprises that  have to bear sole responsibility for their own business profits  and losses but are just government fund suppliers, then the  funds they offer will have the same character as "rice from the  big pot" [da guo fan 1129 6938 7391]. If the financial  institutions are enterprises which operate on their own and bear  sole responsibility for their business profits and losses, then  they will treat the funds as a commodity.    [Zhong] In order to establish a mechanism which makes both  loan-makers and money-borrowers jointly exercise self-control  over the size of credit, it is necessary to make the commercial  banks (including the current specialized banks) operate on their  own and bear responsibility for their own business profits and  losses. This is a necessary precondition. If the commercial  banks really bear responsibility for their own profits and  losses, then they will link the issuance of loans with their own  interests and will make careful assessments and prudently handle  the issuance and recovery of the loans. Before they make loans,  they will carefully evaluate and scientifically analyze the  liquidity of the debtor enterprises and the economic feasibility  of the relevant projects and will not recklessly make credit  arrangements; after the loans are made, they will try by every  possible means to retrieve loans that are due for repayment.  Thus, both loan-makers and loan-users will be facing great  pressure, and they will behave more prudently and rationally  when issuing and accepting loans.    [Gao] The rising demand for loans is also related to their  comparatively low interest rate. Without changing this  situation, even if there are tough terms for repayment, people  may continue to seek more loans.    [Zhong] Reforming the interest rate mechanism is indeed a  major measure for curbing inflation. In our country, the  interest rate is sometimes lower than the inflation rate. The  negative interest rate in reality is not conducive to  restraining the demand for loans; nor is it conducive to  increasing the supply of deposits. To solve this problem, we  may appropriately raise the interest rate, but, in the long run,  we must still take action in the structural aspect. That is, we  should establish a structure in which the interest rates are  formed and adjusted by market forces. With such a structure,  when the demand for loans becomes too great, the interest rate  will automatically rise, and the cost of funds will increase;  thus, enterprises with poor business results will automatically  shrink their scale of production and operation, and investment  projects that do not yield good returns will automatically scale  down. Furthermore, when the interest rate is increasing,  deposits will become more attractive, and some residents will  reduce consumption and add to their savings. The two  developments are both conducive to reducing the currency in  circulation and lowering commodity prices.    [Gao] In our country, inflation has close relations with the  swelling of investment. Whenever the size of investment  expands, currency inflation certainly takes place and commodity  prices go up; whenever the size of investment is brought under  control, prices go down.    [Zhong] At present, the funds for launching new projects  primarily come from bank loans. If the funds for new projects  come from the surplus money of residents or the accumulated  funds of enterprises, then expansion in investment will be based  primarily on the reduction in the enterprise bonuses and welfare  funds and in the immediate consumption of the residents. This  will only change the structure of demand in society and will not  increase the overall quantity of demand. If the size of  investment is expanded in this manner, it will accelerate  economic growth and will not lead to inflation. Moreover, with  such an investment structure plus reform of the banking system,  there will be an effective mechanism for controlling the credit  fund. Even if people are encouraged to launch new investment  projects, they will not do so recklessly. Thus, inflation can be  effectively curbed. In the long run, we cannot merely rely on  administrative means to control the size of investment; instead,  we should set up a self-control mechanism for investors by  reforming the investment and monetary structures.    [Gao] There are also certain relations between enterprises'  economic efficiency and the inflation situation. Do you think  that it will be conducive to curbing inflation if more  enterprises can register fewer business losses?    [Zhong] The enterprises which are running in the red  constitute a cause of inflation in our country. The normal  relationship between the enterprises and the market is as  follows: The former puts currency (including savings) into the  market and takes raw materials and consumer goods for its  workers away from the market. Through one cycle of production,  it puts products back into the market and retrieves the money it  contributed in the past. This will not cause inflation. If  products do not sell, and the enterprise incurs losses and  cannot find a way out, then the enterprise will have to go  bankrupt, and the money will be retrieved by auctioning off its  assets. If the enterprise cannot use its products or assets to  retrieve the money, then the money will remain in the market for  a long time and will affect prices, thus causing inflation.    [Gao] When governments use bank overdrafts to cover  financial  deficits, this also causes inflation. One of the reasons behind  the financial deficits is the failure to cut down on  administrative expenses. What do you think we should do to  solve this problem?    [Zhong] Advancing structural reform in government  institutions is a good way to cut down on administrative  expenses and is also an important element of curbing inflation.  In our country, a major cause of inflation is the excessive  size of government institutions, whose gigantic administrative  expenses lead to financial deficits. When bank overdrafts are  used to cover up these deficits, this directly leads to  inflation. If the deficits are covered up by issuing public  debt, the possibility of inflation still cannot be ruled out.  Therefore, the efforts to curb inflation should also be linked  with steps to streamline government institutions and reduce  administrative expenses.    [Gao] Will the enterprises and local governments' method of  raising funds by issuing bonds and stock also cause inflation?    [Zhong] The enterprises' issuance of bonds and stocks and  the  local governments' fund-raising activities play the same  function as the banks' issuance of loans in increasing the  quantity of currency in circulation. However, we cannot put a  halt to necessary financial activities. In our country, means  of direct fund-raising such as stocks and bonds, as compared  with the means of indirect fund-raising with the banks playing  an intermediate role, are not only representative of the changes  in financial forms but are also representative of the changes in  the monetary system and the character of the funds. The "gift"  funds are thus changed into a type of commodity, and such a  change is conducive to curbing inflation. Of course, in order  to prevent the excessive size of direct fund-raising, which may  lead to the swelling of credit, we should properly handle things  in two aspects: First, there should be a limit for the gross  size of direct fund-raising. Second, when the size of direct  fund-raising is expanding, indirect fund-raising among the banks  should be scaled down accordingly.</p>

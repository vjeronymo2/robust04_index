			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BABCOCK EXPECTED TO LEAVE DENVER, JOIN ATLANTA AS GENERAL MANAGER  </P> <P> Pete Babcock, the off-again, on-again general manager of the Denver Nuggets,  will take over as general manager of the Atlanta Hawks in a move expected to be  completed Wednesday in Atlanta.  </P> <P> The Times' sources said that Stan Kasten, currently president and general  manager of both the Hawks and the Atlanta Braves, will remain the president of  the Hawks but relinquish the Hawks' general manager job to Babcock and  concentrate on the Braves.  </P> <P> Babcock, once an assistant coach of the old San Diego Clippers under Paul  Silas, was the Nuggets' general manager until he was replaced by Dave Checketts  when a new minority ownership took over the Denver team last summer. But when  that deal fell through in late summer, Babcock was back in his old job. Soon,  however, the minority ownership deal went through, with help from TV official  Bob Wussler, and Babcock was replaced by Jon Spolestra, formerly of the  Portland Trailblazers.  </P> <P> Last week, Spoelstra was fired and Babcock was back in once again with the  Nuggets. But when his powers were reduced considerably in the areas of trades  and player personnel, he began negotiating with the Hawks. BILL DWYRE  </P></p>

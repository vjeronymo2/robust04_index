			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Personal Pensions (26): Glad tidings from an ill wind - Alternatives to the life companies / Non-life providers will hope to exploit the poor image of inflexible products and mis-selling that has damaged the insurance companies Companies from outside the life assurance industry are now gearing themselves up to make their second attempt at grabbing an important share of the personal pensions business. In the past, however, they have failed to overcome the barrier of investor indifference. New hope for the non-lifers springs essentially from the so-called 'hard' disclosure of commissions and charges on life policies, which comes into effect next January. These non-life providers will also be seeking to exploit the poor image of inflexible products and mis-selling which has so badly damaged the life companies in recent months. When personal pensions legislation was introduced in the mid-1980s, the government went out of its way to ensure that the new pensions products would no longer be confined to the life assurance closed shop. It was expected that unit trust companies, building societies and banks would all participate in the exciting new markets, providing an important new layer of competition for the life companies. But it didn't work out like that. Although new entrants appeared, most providers of unit trust pensions, such as Fidelity or Midland Bank, eventually either pulled out or switched to life assurance vehicles. Only a handful, such as Gartmore, Invesco and NM Rothschild, are still in business with niche products. They found marketing difficult when they could not use the life assurance distribution channels. Lower charges made the non-life pensions products inherently attractive, but the market turned out not to be very price-sensitive - a consequence of the life industry's ability to conceal its costs. Administration also turned out to be something of a nightmare for providers such as unit trust companies, which are used to handling simple transactions involving straightforward products. While the life offices sold millions of personal pension plans, the non-life companies could only gain a toehold in the market, albeit probably towards the higher-value end of the spectrum. Fidelity had around 3,000 clients, for instance, when it pulled the plug in 1993. It is possible, however, that the sales techniques which proved so successful for the life companies will now rebound against them. One non-life provider which has remained in business, however, is the intermediary and consultancy group Pointon York, which is using the framework for self-invested personal pensions (Sipps) which were introduced in the 1989 Budget. Sipps can be invested in a range of assets in a tailored and transparent way. Mr Nigel Goodhew, a Pointon York director, says that a Sipp is the right product for between 5 and 10 per cent of UK earners, but that 'my problem is how to get to them'. So far the whole Sipp market embraces only about 3,000 clients. However, Mr Goodhew expects Sipps to get a shot in the arm from hard commission disclosure and greater job mobility for executives. He thinks there will be 50,000 Sipps in existence by the year 2000. An unexpected new entrant to the personal pensions market last February was Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust, which has extended its long-established regular savings scheme (which is a particularly economical way of buying shares in the investment trust) so that it can handle personal pension plans. Key features of the F &amp; C plan include low costs and flexibility, so that there are none of the penalties that life companies can impose for reduced contributions or missed instalments. However, savers are also likely to need advice on how to handle the risks of a single stock market-based investment in the years immediately preceding retirement. In general, it is the absence of a developed infrastructure of fee-charging advisers that has inhibited the growth of non-life personal pensions in the UK. The question is whether the new disclosure climate will push the market firmly enough in the non-life direction. Fidelity is trying to tackle the market in a different way. It is drawing on the experience of its American parent, which has successfully exploited the trend towards company 'money purchase' pension schemes in the US. So Fidelity has launched a unit trust-based company scheme, reckoning that it is more practical to reach investors through their employing company than directly through individual personal pension plans. The rather pessimistic implication, however, is that Fidelity thinks it is always likely to be very expensive to sell plans directly. But a few more new entrants on the lines of F &amp; C might help popularise the idea that life and pensions do not automatically go together.</p>

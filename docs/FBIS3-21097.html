			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by P.L.: "1994: Year of Merger Among European </F> Missile Manufacturers"; introductory paragraph in boldface as  published]    [Text] Both teams are making preparations  simultaneously for French-British and French-German  regroupings--which are then expected to merge.    Discussing the merger of missile activities by Matra Defense  and British Aerospace [BAe] Dynamics, Noel Forgeard,  Matra-Hachette's general manager in charge of defense and space  and chief executive officer of Matra Defense, writes in the  group's in-house newspaper that "detailed talks between the  teams are making progress, with both sides showing a desire to  conclude the discussions as soon as possible in 1994."    According to Forgeard, "it is very desirable that the  resulting Matra-BAe (missile) company be joined by Aerospatiale  and Deutsche Aerospace [DASA], and it is very likely that that  will happen in the medium term."    For the time being, the French-German team is continuing its  separate efforts to merge the missile activities of those two  firms in a new company that may be called Euromissile, thus  retaining the name of the current consortium. But this is not  certain, since the two companies have asked for in-house  suggestions regarding a less "Euro" name!    What is certain, on the other hand, is that the merger of  missile activities by Aerospatiale and Deutsche Aerospace is in  the final stretch. Officials met in Munich before Christmas to  finalize their communication strategy with a view to an upcoming  announcement regarding the new French-German missile company  formed by Aerospatiale and DASA.    It is therefore likely that we will see the simultaneous  regrouping of Matra-BAe and Aerospatiale and DASA in 1994.</p>

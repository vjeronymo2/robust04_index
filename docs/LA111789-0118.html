			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A LOT OF HISTORY;  </P> <P> PARKING STRUCTURE HOUSES MEMORIAL TO L.A. PIONEER  </P> <P> Born a slave in 1818, Biddy Mason walked to California behind her Mississippi  master's covered wagon, won her freedom in a Los Angeles court and saved the  wages from her job as a midwife to buy a $250 plot near downtown's 4th and  Spring streets in 1866.  </P> <P> She built a wooden house, then a mixed-use brick building with business space  on the first floor and her home above. From that home she founded a day nursery  and a school and, in 1872, the First African Methodist Episcopal Church of Los  Angeles. In 1885, her grandsons started a livery stable on the bustling block.  </P> <P> On Thursday, which was declared "Biddy Mason Day in Los Angeles," her  descendants returned to the site of the old homestead and snipped two ribbons  at a new mixed-use building called the Broadway Spring Center.  </P> <P> The first ribbon cutting officially opened the $24-million facility's  1,274-space public parking garage, which will serve the Ronald Reagan State  Building due to open across Spring Street next fall.  </P> <P> The second ribbon, officially snipped by Biddy Mason's 95-year-old  great-granddaughter, Gladys Owens Smith, was mounted on a new city monument to  black history.  </P> <P> Only after turning into the modern version of the livery will unsuspecting  drivers see the monument by graphic designer Sheila Levrant de Bretteville. The  memorial, located outside the garage's west end, is a striking 8-by-81-foot  time-line wall of Los Angeles' and Mason's intertwined history during the 19th  Century.  </P> <P> Any driver taking elevators to retrieve a car in the 10-story facility will see  another public work of art, a collage reminiscent of Biddy Mason's original  wood frame home, done by sculptor and assemblage artist Betye Saar.  </P> <P> The melding of historic art with a functional parking structure -- "no small  challenge . . . to do with dignity," noted James Wood of the Community  Redevelopment Agency -- was accomplished through the joint efforts of the Power  of Place, a UCLA-affiliated organization that promotes Los Angeles'  multicultural history, and City Councilwoman Joy Picus.  </P> <P> They persuaded city planners that the CRA requirement that developers provide  public art in downtown projects could be used to memorialize Biddy Mason's  pioneer contributions to the city.  </P> <P> "It's just marvelous," said Smith, accompanied by her great-granddaughter,  Linda Cox, and Cox's daughters, Cheryl, 11, and Robynn, 9.  </P> <P> "More people will see this in a parking garage, and recognize what she did,  than they would a painting somewhere else," said Smith, who was in no way upset  that her energetic ancestor has been memorialized in a parking structure.  </P> <P> The new complex, which stretches from Spring Street on the east to Broadway on  the west mid-block between 3rd and 4th streets, will also include 35,000 square  feet of retail space, sidewalk cafes and a food court, and a landscaped, walled  and gated park.  </P> <P> Parking is available now. The park is under construction.  </P> <P> Thomas Phillips of System Parking Investments, a co-developer in the project,  said that although the street-level retail shops are not yet open, the space is  65% leased. The center should be in full operation within six months, he said.  </P> <P> Responding to concerns that the 3,000 future Reagan Building employees might  not be safe in the area, which is on the edge of Skid Row, developer Robert  Silberman of Allied Parking Ltd. said the complex will have 24-hour,  state-of-the-art security designed by the Los Angeles Police Department.  </P> <P> Asked about homeless people who frequently sleep on nearby sidewalks, Silberman  pointed out that even the park and food court will have locking gates.  </P> <P> "They can still sleep on the sidewalk," he said. "We are not building a park  for people to sleep in."  </P></p>

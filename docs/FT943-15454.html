			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Chinese PM cuts rest of German tour: Protests highlight suppression of Tiananmen Square uprising To the embarrassment of his government hosts, and the bewilderment of the Bavarians who were waiting to see him, Mr Li Peng, the Chinese prime minister, yesterday abruptly cancelled the remainder of his official visit to Germany. For the second day in succession the Chinese leader simply abandoned parts of his programme, apparently out of anger over planned demonstrations to protest at his role in suppressing the Tiananmen Square uprising in 1989. Yesterday he refused to attend both final events in his official visit to Bavaria - an inspection of a typical Bavarian farm, and a boat trip on the scenic Tegern lake in the foothills of the Alps. En route to the boat ride, protesters had erected a papier-mache model of the Statue of Liberty, just as the Tiananmen students did five years ago. Mr Li declined an offer of an alternative route to the lake-shore. Instead, he lingered as long as possible in the company of Germany's leading industrialists, including the managers of Siemens and Deutsche Aerospace, and finally retired to the security of his Munich hotel suite. His behaviour has aroused the scorn of wide sections of the German press and an embarrassed hush from the government, which had hoped to entertain him for a big trade-promoting trip without too much talk of human rights. The popular Bild Zeitung, a strong supporter of the German government, ridiculed the Chinese leader on its front page and in an editorial column, saying: 'You expect respect, but so do we.' Commenting on the plight of the mayor of Berlin, who was left to wander on his own through the Brandenburg gate on Thursday, when Mr Li failed to appear, the newspaper said: 'Our democratically elected politicians certainly do not have to let themselves be insulted by you.' The government insisted last night that the end of Mr Li's visit would still go ahead as planned: a farewell handshake from the government's head of protocol at Munich airport, around lunchtime today. He then flies on to Bucharest. On Thursday Mr Dieter Vogel, the government spokesman, said that while Bonn regretted what had happened, 'we must also say that demonstrations are allowed in Germany, if they are peaceful. However, the federal government does not believe that it is the right way to promote human rights.' Before he cancelled his programme, Mr Li and his delegation had signed further contracts and letters of intent with Siemens, Daimler-Benz' subsidiary Deutsche Aerospace, and MAN. The contracts with Siemens involve joint ventures to build three coal-fired power stations, raising total Chinese business planned by the group to DM6bn (Pounds 2.4bn). At Deutsche Aerospace, the Chinese signed documents to found a joint space satellite enterprise, and at MAN they finalised a licensing agreement for the China National Heavy Duty Truck Corporation to build up to 5,000 bus chassis a year.</p>

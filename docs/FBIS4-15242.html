			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 7 TASS -- "Along with urging to step up  anti-crime struggle, deputies to the Federation Council are  actually creating obstacles for law-enforcement agencies,  because in the current situation every lawyer may turn down any  state prosecutor on the grounds that he was appointed by the  prosecutor-general, not approved by the Federation Council,"  Georgiy Satarov, President Yeltsin's aide, told ITAR-TASS today.  He commented on the desire of the upper chamber of the Russian  parliament to set its resolution on the problem of the Russian  prosecutor-general against the instructions of the head of state.    Satarov explained why Kazannik under no condition can come  back to the post of prosecutor-general: "There is no legal act  under which Kazannik could claim his previous post. He was not  approved by the Federation Council on that post, and the  president's decree on his resignation was the latest document.  If the president removed Kazannik from his post by his own free  will, the Federation Council would have the right to examine  reasons for the decision taken by the head of state. However,  Kazannik's resignation was voluntary, and the president only  accepted it. According to the Constitution the head of state is  the only one who has the right to submit to the Federation  Council a candidature to the post of prosecutor-general."    President Yeltsin's aide stressed that the April 6 voting at  the upper chamber of parliament over the acceptance or  non-acceptance of Kazannik's resignation actually blocked a  possibility of approving on that post of Aleksey Ilyushenko,  whose candidature was suggested by the president, because the  Federation Council linked the approval of the new  prosecutor-general with the acceptance of the resignation of the  previous one.    According to Satarov, Ilyushenko may be removed from  discharging the duties of the prosecutor-general only if the  president officially submits his candidature to the Federation  Council, and the deputies reject it. Now, however, they cannot  do it, because the resignation of Kazannik has not been accepted.    In his opinion, the only way out of this deadlock is to  accept the resignation of Kazannik, thus paving the way for the  functioning of constitutional mechanisms of the appointment of a  new prosecutor- general. Until that time, "the contradiction  between the old way of appointing a prosecutor-general and a  principle of the new Russian Constitution, which cannot be  settled by legal means, will continue to exist," Satarov said.  It is not clear, however, whether or not the Federation Council  will agree to hold another voting on this issue.</p>

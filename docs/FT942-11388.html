			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (33): Global inspector keeps a low profile - Profile of the world's largest provider of import-export services for both public and private sector organisations / Societe Generale de Surveillance Geneva based Societe Generale de Surveillance (SGS) is the world's largest international trade inspection, testing and verification organisation, operating in more than 140 countries through 1,170 offices and 309 laboratories staffed by 31,000 people. The group claims its services facilitate the execution of transactions, increase the safety and long-term reliability of plant and equipment and prevent the disruption of delivery and production schedules. SGS and its competitors are best known for providing import and export verification services for governments and aid organisations to ensure goods delivered are what the customer ordered and that they are delivered to the proper recipient and invoiced at a fair price. In the mid-1980s, these activities were occasionally contested. In 1987, the US's International Trade Commission (ITC) took up complaints from US exporters that SGS and other inspection companies used unfair trade practices in their pre-shipment inspection of US exports. SGS had been hired by 25 developing countries that suspected they were being overcharged for what they ordered. The ITC eventually backed away from the case. In 1985, the Indonesian government hired SGS to overhaul its notoriously corrupt customs service and inspect all imports in countries supplying them. This had an immediate impact on the speed with which goods cleared Indonesian customs and on costs. The Indonesian government has since renewed the contract, probably SGS's largest, several times. SGS was founded in the 1870s when Mr Henri Goldstuck, a young Baltic refugee, persuaded a French oats merchant to pay him a commission for improving the handling and storage of his grain. The agriculture sector accounts for an eighth of the group's SFr2.6bn revenues last year, and its expertise now covers 250 commodities and products. The group's services to the natural resources industries centre on quality inspections supported by sophisticated laboratories. These sectors account for about a fifth of group revenues. SGS drew attention in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Some of its directors wanted it to diversify into higher value activities. Others felt it had to avoid conventional manufacturing or service businesses because of potential conflicts of interest. They enlisted Elisabeth Salina Amorini, a leader of the younger generation of the controlling families, in their cause. Four directors resigned in 1989 and Mrs Salina, a lawyer with London investment banking experience, became chairman. The group's recent expansions have been into insurance adjusting and inspection and monitoring services for the environment, health care and biosciences industries. SGS officials say these fields are consistent with group policy. 'All of our businesses assess values or technical conditions on new or used goods,' a spokesman says.</p>

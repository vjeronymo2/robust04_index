We obtained a high efficiency of 70&percnt; by using a  500  MHz band one-element antenna with &lgr;/40 element. We also  realized a unidirectional radiation pattern and a higher  radiation efficiency than an equivalent Cu antenna by using a  900 MHz band two-element superdirective antenna with a &lgr;/20  element and a &lgr;/11 element spacing. We confirm that the use  of  superconductors and the present design principle are very  effective for realizing high efficient small antennas.  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   Highly efficient small antennas are required for use as  environmental monitors, which can detect long wavelength radio  waves sensitively. However, the radiation resistance is very low  in electrically small antennas, which have elements whose length  is shorter than their wavelength. The radiation resistance of  superdirective allay antennas, which have element spacings  shorter than their wavelength, are also very low. Consequently,  the loss resistance is relatively high and the radiation  efficiency is very low when these small antennas are made of  normal conductors. However, if a superconductor is used to  fabricate small antennas, high efficiency can be maintained.  Therefore, small antennas made of metal superconductors, such as  lead, have been studied.&lt;sup&gt; 1,2&lt;/sup&gt;  Although these antennas  exhibited a lower antenna loss than equivalent antennas made of  normal conductors, it was difficult to achieve a high absolute  gain because they required the use of a cooling system with  metal insulators, and this caused a decrease in antenna gain.    Since the discovery of high temperature superconductors  (HTS), such as YBaCuO (YBCO) and BiSrCaCuO (BSCCO), many  superconductive small antennas have been  developed&lt;sup&gt; 3-5&lt;/sup&gt;  because they only require simple  cooling systems.    This paper proposes small antennas made with HTS, which are  composed of helical elements and quarter-wave matching circuits  and a feed network.&lt;sup&gt; 6-9&lt;/sup&gt;  The properties of these  antennas are also described.  <H5>  1. Antenna Structure </H5>   Figure 1(a) and (b) show the equivalent circuits of a  one-element (a) and a two-element (b) antenna.  I&lt;sup&gt; e&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt;  (= &xgr;&lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt; I&lt;inf&gt; 0&lt;/inf&gt;  exp (j&dgr;&lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt; ) where&xgr;&lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt; , I&lt;inf&gt; 0&lt;/inf&gt; ,  &dgr;&lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt;  are real numbers) and  R&lt;sup&gt; in&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt;  are, respectively, the excitation  currents and input resistance of the n-th element (n = 1,2)  which is self-resonating at a designed frequency.  Z&lt;sup&gt; m&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; cn&lt;/inf&gt; , &agr;&lt;sup&gt; m&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt;  and  L&lt;sup&gt; m&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt;  are the characteristic impedance,  attenuation constant and length of the matching circuit,  respectively. Z&lt;sup&gt; d&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; cn&lt;/inf&gt; ,  &agr;&lt;sup&gt; d&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt;  and L&lt;sup&gt; d&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt;  are the characteristic impedance, attenuation constant and  length of delay times, respectively, Z&lt;sup&gt; f&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; c&lt;/inf&gt;  is the characteristic impedance of a feed line. The antenna is  composed of a feed network which is composed of a feed line and  delay lines, matching circuits and helical elements. Since  R&lt;sup&gt; in&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt;  values are generally much lower  than Z&lt;sup&gt; f&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; c&lt;/inf&gt;  values, it is essential to  match these impedances. &lgr;/4 matching circuits are used in  these antennas, because they are easily formed using brittle  sintered HTS. Self-resonant helical coils are used for the  radiators,&lt;sup&gt; 10&lt;/sup&gt;  because only the resistance (real part  of the impedance) can be matched with a &lgr;/4 matching circuit.  In order to adjust each I&lt;sup&gt; e&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt;  to its  designed value, Z&lt;sup&gt; m&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; cn&lt;/inf&gt;  and  L&lt;sup&gt; m&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt;  are determined while  L&lt;sup&gt; m&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt;  is fixed at a quarter of an  effective wavelength on a parallel line. Figure 2 shows the  antennas made of HTS materials. Antennas A and B are 500 MHz  band one-element antennas with elements which are &lgr;/40 in  length and antenna C is a 900 MHz-band two-element end fire  superdirective array antenna with &lgr;/20 length element and a  &lgr;/11 element spacing.         <H5>    2. One-Element Small Antenna </H5> <H5>  2.1 Design and Fabrication </H5>   The helical elements of antennas A and B in Figure 2 were  designed to resonate at 500 MHz by using the moment  method.&lt;sup&gt; 11&lt;/sup&gt;  The directive gain of the radiators was  calculated at 0.5 dBi. Figure 3 shows the loss at a helical  element (&zgr;&lt;sup&gt; e&lt;/sup&gt; ) as a function of element length  (L&lt;sup&gt; e&lt;/sup&gt; ). When the surface resistance (R&lt;inf&gt; s&lt;/inf&gt; )  is large &zgr;&lt;sup&gt; e&lt;/sup&gt;  increases rapidly as L&lt;sup&gt; e&lt;/sup&gt;  decreases. The elements of antennas A and B were made of  sintered BSCCO, whose surface resistance was about 0.5 m&ohm;'o'hgr; at  500 MHz at 77 K.&lt;sup&gt; 12&lt;/sup&gt;  The &zgr;&lt;sup&gt; r&lt;/sup&gt;  values are  therefore calculated to be about 0.4 dB in these elements. The  input resistance of the element is calculated to be 0.37 &ohm;'o'hgr;.       The matching circuit of antenna A was made of two Cu bars  and  a dielectric sheet (teflon) was placed between them. A parallel  meander line made of EuBaCuO thin-films&lt;sup&gt; 13&lt;/sup&gt;  was used  for the matching circuit of antenna B in order to reduce the  antenna size. The element and the matching circuit of both  antennas were joined using silver paste. The loss of the Cu  matching circuit of antenna A is not so highbecause the parallel  line has a relatively large cross section.&lt;sup&gt; 7&lt;/sup&gt;  By  connecting the parallel line of the matching circuit to the  microstripline of the feed network, the microstripline works as  a balun (converter from balanced mode to unbalanced  mode).&lt;sup&gt; 6&lt;/sup&gt;  <H5>  2.2 Results and Discussions </H5>   Figure 4 shows the actual gain of antenna A as a function of  frequency. The gain of an equivalent Cu antenna is also shown in  this figure for comparison. The actual gain of antenna A was  -1.2 dBi at 80 K and 488 MHz and was 7.8 dB and 6.2 dB higher  than the actual gain of the equivalent Cu antenna at room  temperature (R.T.) and 77 K, respectively. This value  corresponds to 70&percnt; of the radiation efficiency, and it is  also  very high compared with those of previously reported  superconductive small antennas. The actual gain of antenna B was  -4.5 dBi at 80 K and 469 MHz, and this value was 9.6 dB and 5.4  dB higher than that of the equivalent Cu antenna at R.T. and 70  K, respectively. This enabled us to confirm that these  superconductive small antennas are more effective in realizing  high-gain than a Cu small antenna. The relatively lower gain in  antenna B is attributed to the loss at the joint between the  helical element and the matching circuit. We believe that the  gain will be improved by improving the joining method.     <H5>  3. Superdirective Array Antenna </H5> <H5>  3.1 Design and Fabrication </H5>   In a two-element array antenna, the excitation current for  each element, which leads to results in maximum gain, should be  determined by solving the following differential equation:    Partial derivative of G&lt;inf&gt; d&lt;/inf&gt;  with respect to  I&lt;sup&gt; r&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt;  = O (n = 1,2)    where G&lt;inf&gt; d&lt;/inf&gt;  is the directive gain of an antenna. If  we assume that the resonant frequency is 900 MHz and the element  spacing (d&lt;inf&gt; e&lt;/inf&gt; ) is 30, relations between excitation  currents (I&lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt; , I&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; ) of &xgr;&lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt;  =  &xgr;&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  and &dgr;&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  - &dgr;&lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt;  =  165.6&deg; are obtained.&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  The self- and  mutual-impedances (Z&lt;inf&gt; nm&lt;/inf&gt;  n,m = 1,2) of the elements  are calculated by the moment method. The input impedances  Z&lt;sup&gt; in&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt;  (= R&lt;sup&gt; in&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt;  +  jX&lt;sup&gt; in&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt; ) of the elements are computed by  using Z&lt;inf&gt; nm&lt;/inf&gt;  and I&lt;inf&gt; m&lt;/inf&gt; . In this antenna, we  can theoretically expect a derivative gain of 6.2 dBi, which is  5.3 dB higher than that of a one element antenna, and a front-  to-back ratio of 7.9 dB in the radiation pattern.    Figure 5 shows the loss at the element (&zgr;&lt;sup&gt; e&lt;/sup&gt; ) of  a 900 MHz band two-element array antenna as a function of  d&lt;inf&gt; e&lt;/inf&gt; . When R&lt;inf&gt; s&lt;/inf&gt;  is large, &zgr;&lt;sup&gt; e&lt;/sup&gt;  increases rapidly as d&lt;inf&gt; e&lt;/inf&gt;  decreases. As with antennas  A and B the elements of antenna C were made of BSCCO. Since the  surface resistance of BSCCO at 900 MHz and 80 K is 2  m&ohm;'o'hgr;,&lt;sup&gt; 12&lt;/sup&gt;  the loss was calculated at about 2.5 dB. The  input resistance of each element, R&lt;sup&gt; in&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt;  and R&lt;sup&gt; in&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; , was calculated at 2.0 &ohm;'o'hgr; and  -1.66 &ohm;'o'hgr;, respectively. The negative value of  R&lt;sup&gt; in&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  indicates that the element draws  radiatedpower from the other element which has a positive  R&lt;sup&gt; in&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt; . This is due to the strong mutual  coupling between two elements placed closely to each  other.&lt;sup&gt; 14&lt;/sup&gt;  Therefore, in order to obtain a theoretical  antenna gain, the power received at the negative  R&lt;sup&gt; in&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  element must be fed back to the  positive R&lt;sup&gt; in&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt;  element through the feed  network. In order to realize the above feedback mechanism, the  feed network must fulfill the following conditions:       (1) The difference in line length from the elements to the  branch point must be equal to the phase difference between the  excitation currents (&dgr;&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -&dgr;&lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt; ).    (2) The total line length between positive- and negative-  R&lt;sup&gt; in&lt;/sup&gt;  elements via the branch point must also  correspond to &dgr;&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -&dgr;&lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt;  +/-&pgr;.    Consequently, L&lt;sup&gt; d&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt;  is determined  uniquely, and this is a particular feature of the superdirective  array antenna.&lt;sup&gt; 9&lt;/sup&gt;  The matching circuit of antenna C  was made of sintered BSCCO, and the feed network was made using  a conventional printed circuit board (&egr;&lt;inf&gt; r&lt;/inf&gt;  = 10.2).  The elements, the matching circuits and the feed network were  joined together with silver paste.  <H5>  3.2 Results and Discussion </H5>   The actual gain of antenna C was -4.2 dBi at 910 MHz and 80  K. Its gain was 5.4 dB and 4.0 dB higher than that of an  equivalent Cu antenna at R.T. and 77 K, respectively. We  therefore confirm that the superconductive small antenna  exhibits a higher gain than a Cu antenna. Figure 6 shows the  designed and measured radiation pattern of antenna C. Although  unexpected radiations, which perhaps emanated from the feed  system, were observed around &phgr; = 205&deg;, a unidirectional  radiation pattern and front-to-back ratio of 6.8 dB were  confirmed for the antenna. The fact that the actual gain of  antenna C was lower than the designed value seemed to result  mainly from ohmic losses in the Cu lines and silver paste  joints, and unwanted radiation. The gain should be improved by  changing the feed network from normal conductors to  superconductors.     <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   We proposed a design principle for superconductive small  antennas with quarter-wavelength parallel line matching circuits  and helical coil elements and/or a feed network. On the basis of  this concept, we fabricated a 500 MHz-band one element antenna  with a 0.025 &lgr; radiator and 900 MHz band two-element and  end-fire superdirective array antenna with a 0.09 &lgr; radiator  spacing and 0.05 &lgr; radiator length. These antennas exhibited  a  higher efficiency than an equivalent Cu antenna. We confirmed  that the superconductor and the present antenna structures can  be used to realize highly efficient small antennas.  References    1. G.B. Walker and C.R.

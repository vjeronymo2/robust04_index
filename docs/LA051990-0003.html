			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AND ANGEL FANS ARE VERY UNHAPPY, TOO  </P> <P> How convenient it must be for Gene Autry to have both his Western Heritage  Museum and Anaheim Stadium to house expensive relics from the past. With the  Angels acquiring another high-priced, over-the-hill superstar in Dave Winfield,  Autry and Mike Port will have to decide when to make Winfield's transition from  the Big A to a nice display case at the museum.  </P> <P> DAN ROSMAN, Redondo Beach  </P></p>

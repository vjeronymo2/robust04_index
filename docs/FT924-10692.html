			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Falling rubber price leaves Bertam lower Bertam Holdings, the rubber and oil palm producer and property dealer, reported per-tax profits of Pounds 354,000 for the first half of 1992, down 15 per cent on the Pounds 418,000 achieved in the comparable period. The company said that palm oil prices held up well during the period, but rubber prices had been disappointing. The completion of a MDollars 50m (Pounds 12.7m) land sale to Bertam Properties, in which the group has a 40 per cent stake, meant that the planned acquisition of three companies would take place in November. Further joint ventures would be sought on plantation land with local Malaysian partners. Turnover was little changed at Pounds 598,000 and operating profit was Pounds 465,000 (Pounds 494,000). Earnings per share came to 1.07p (1.45p).</p>

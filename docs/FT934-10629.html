			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: GEC will only bid for full control of Ferranti GEC, which has proposed a 1p-a-share bid for Ferranti, has told Ferranti's chairman Mr Eugene Anderson, that it is only interested in taking 100 per cent control of the troubled defence electronics group. Mr Anderson, responding to a series of questions raised by Mr John Katz, who is representing some disgruntled Ferranti shareholders, said he had spoken again to GEC about the possibility of leaving current shareholders with a minority stake in a Ferranti which would be majority controlled by GEC. 'The answer was unequivocal,' Mr Anderson said. 'They will not bid for anything less than 100 per cent of the equity. They believe that they need this position in order to have the flexibility to take the actions necessary to reverse the deterioration of Ferranti brought on by its weak balance sheet and lack of liquidity.' There are growing signs that some of Ferranti's 48,000 individual shareholders are deeply unhappy with the GEC offer. This, together with Ferranti's complex share structure, has raised doubts over whether GEC will be successful in winning the backing of investors holding 90 per cent of the equity and raised hopes among some investors that GEC might settle for becoming the majority shareholder. However, Mr Anderson made it clear yesterday that GEC has reiterated that it will only go forward with the bid 'if it receives 90 per cent acceptances' - the minimum percentage required under company law to compulsorily purchase the rest. Meanwhile Mr Katz has invited Mr Anderson to make a presentation to disgruntled Ferranti shareholders at a meeting he is planning to hold to discuss their campaign. Mr Katz, who has received hundreds of telephone calls from anxious individual Ferranti shareholders, said yesterday that he hoped to arrange the meeting to give them the chance to air their views.</p>

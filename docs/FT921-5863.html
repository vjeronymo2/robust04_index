			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Letter: Failure of many quality programmes no surprise Sir, Tony Gill (Letters, February 21) may have been disappointed by Christopher Lorenz (Management February 17), but we are disappointed with Tony Gill. He has fallen into the trap of taking one theme, in his case systemic thinking, and presenting it as a universal business panacea. Systemic thinking is only one element of the total system quality approach. This requires examination of the company as a whole. We call it the house of change. Its three main building blocks are the company environment, organisation and systems. We deliberately use the word environment, culture is too narrow a concept. Supporting these must be a communication system and a management education process. Above everything, change requires leadership, and when we say leadership we do not mean management. Given the half-hearted approach of both management and consultants to total quality, it is not surprising that a recent survey suggests that eight out of ten quality programmes taking place in the UK are failing. Leaders of British industry must understand the total system quality approach and why they need to commit to it and then protect it. When leaders stop leading, followers stop following. That is the real crisis that business is facing in the UK. Simon Greenly, chairman, Greenly's, 39 Thames Street, Windsor, Berkshire SL4 1PR</p>

			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Risk and Reward: Broadening the horizons of currency exposure management UNTIL recently, the use of derivatives by non-financial companies had only sparked interest among shareholders if disaster struck. In these instances - such as Allied Lyons' Pounds 150m loss in 1991, when a treasury official wrote uncovered currency options - the focus tended to be on the cause of the short-term hit, usually speculation or inadequate management controls. However, more attention is now being paid to the broader implications of a company's policy on currency risk management. The volatility in exchange rates in the last year, and the virtual collapse of the exchange rate mechanism, has heightened the awareness of institutional investors of the potential impact on profitability of a company's approach to currency exposure. Last year, the Association of Corporate Treasurers published a set of draft guidelines designed to make it easier for institutional investors to analyse the implications of foreign exchange management. The subject has been a matter of intense debate, since there is some opposition to increasing disclosure, but definitive guidelines are expected this autumn. Mr Gerald Leahy of the ACT said there was a strong feeling there should be better qualitative, if not quantitative, information on treasury policy. Stock analysts are also waking up to the importance of currency hedging in analysing an international company's performance prospects. For example, Credit Lyonnais Laing recently published a ground-breaking piece of research on the UK drinks industry entitled 'Currency hedging in the drinks sector', which provides an unusually detailed examination of the practices of companies like Grand Metropolitan, Guinness and Bass. As well as defining the extent and nature of these companies' foreign exchange exposure, analyst Ms Julie Bower details their policies on dealing with their exposure. She notes that in general, 'too much attention is paid to the exposure of companies to currency movements as reported in their accounts, and too little to the underlying long-term competitive positions of companies under various exchange rate scenarios'. There are three types of currency exposure: transaction exposure, which is the exposure to exchange rate movements between a sale and its settlement; translation exposure, which relates to the effects of currency movements on a company's accounts when reported in the home currency, and is held to be of significance only for accounting purposes; and economic exposure, which describes the extent to which the present value of expected future cash flows changes with currencies. Ms Bower argues that companies tend to concentrate too little on the third of the these categories. '(Economic exposure) is a true exposure which managements should be seeking to optimise through a financial management programme that complements their long-term strategic planning process.' She makes the important point that hedging can be financial or strategic. For example, Japan's Nikka Whisky Distilling Company bought a large Scottish distillery in 1989, reducing the operating risk of being dependent on exported whisky from Scotland for its own Japanese blended whiskies by hedging its long-term economic exposure to the sterling/yen exchange rate through an investment in the home market of its suppliers. Undoubtedly, the pressure on companies to provide better information is increasing. Last year, Mr Hugh Jenkins, chief executive of Prudential Portfolio Managers, described information given by most companies as 'minimal' even though the Report and Accounts is the correct medium for disclosure. Most senior managers claim they are anti-speculation, yet they follow selective hedging policies designed to protect against anticipated adverse currency movements. Yet in practice it is often the case that hedging is only useful in protecting the company against unexpected changes. The consequence for investors is uncertainty. If a fund manager buys a UK stock because he thinks the company will benefit from increased US earnings, he needs to know if the dollar exposure of that company is hedged. At present, he is often in the dark.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A two-stage government: The first cabinet would be a  constituent one and would last a few months. The prime minister  -- not necessarily from the [Northern] League -- would have to  be a "staunch federalist." He would chair a governmental  committee which would submit to parliament a bill for a new  constitution. The second period would be political. The  government would last five years altogether. This is the  League's latest proposal to overcome the impasse. It was made  by Roberto Maroni.    Before that, the speakers of both chambers must be elected.  The League has asked to meet Forza Italia, the National  Alliance, the Christian Democratic Center, and the Lista  Pannella on Monday [11 April].</p>

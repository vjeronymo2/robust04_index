			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / International Company News: Royal Trust quarterly dividend cut to 10 cents ROYAL Trust, the financial services group controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family, has cut its quarterly dividend and is putting up for sale the US banking subsidiary which it acquired less than three years ago. The measures are a response to the unexpectedly severe slump in North American and UK property markets which has sharply increased the losses which Royal Trust is likely to suffer on its loan portfolio. Companies in the Bronfman empire are closely linked through investments in each other's common and preferred shares. Problems at Royal Trust and at Bramalea, a property developer, have recently eroded investor confidence in the group. The company said that RT's dividend cut, from 18.5 cents to 10 cents a share, would not be material to the group's most senior companies, such as Brascan, Hees International and Edper. Brascan has a 23 per cent indirect interest in RT. RT's share price fell 25 cents in early trading on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday to CDollars 5.75. The shares reached a peak of almost CDollars 36 in 1986. Shares of other Bronfman-controlled companies were little changed. RT suffered a second-quarter loss of CDollars 8m or 14 cents a share, compared to a CDollars 43m profit or 17 cents a share a year earlier. Loan loss provisions jumped to CDollars 70m (USDollars 58.3m) from CDollars 27m. The weakness of the UK property market led London-based Royal Trust Bank to set aside CDollars 27m in loan-loss provisions. The British operation suffered a CDollars 34m loss. Non-performing loans in RT's Canadian corporate and commercial loan portfolio have jumped from 1.2 per cent to 5.1 per cent in the past year. The company disclosed that 43 per cent of 'discontinued' loans in the US, totalling CDollars 583m, were non-performing. RT's decision to sell its US subsidiary, Pacific First Bank of Seattle, marks a further humiliating retreat from efforts during the 1980s to expand outside Canada. The company has either sold or closed most of the assets acquired with the purchase in 1986 of Dow Financial Services, the international banking arm of Dow Chemical. Pacific First has 136 branches, most of which were part of former savings and loan institutions.</p>

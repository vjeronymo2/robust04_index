			<p>BFN     [Text] Colombian Deputy Foreign Minister Andelfo Garcia,  who is heading the Colombian delegation to the joint  Cuban-Colombian commission, has stated that diplomatic relations  between Cuba and Colombia have been reestablished in order to  preserve and develop them. This is the first bilateral meeting  since Cuba and Colombia reestablished diplomatic relations and  according to Garcia there were no difficulties in reaching  agreements in the spheres of education, culture, sports,  tourism, and science.    [Begin Garcia recording] There were no problems in moving  forward in all these spheres. The primary difficulty is the  reestablishment of regular channels so that these relations can  flow freely. It is usually up to the governments to open such  channels and allow such relations to be established by  initiatives on the part of the two sides. That step has already  been taken. [end recording]    Garcia also said that relations between the two countries  have been strengthened in a very short period of time.    [Begin Garcia recording] After the visits to Bogota of  Foreign Minister Robaina and Carlos Lage, vice minister of the  Council of State, relations have been boosted. What we are doing  is merely the continuation of those efforts, made at the  presidential level through the meeting between President Castro  and President Gaviria in Cartagena and later through the visits  of Foreign Minister Robaina and Vice President Lage -- and now  we are meeting in this joint commission. [end recording]    The conversations of the joint Cuban-Colombian commission  are  to continue in October 1994 and April 1995 in Santa Fe de Bogota.</p>

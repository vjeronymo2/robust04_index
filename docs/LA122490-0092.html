			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE;  </P> <P> FUNDS SOUGHT FOR ROAD IMPROVEMENTS  </P> <P> The City Council has approved a request for nearly $300,000 in county matching  grant funds to improve El Camino Real, the main street linking the north and  south ends of the city.  </P> <P> Plans call for repaving the north end of the four-lane street from Avenida  Mateo to El Portal, with the city paying for half of the project, estimated to  cost $594,000.  </P> <P> The council also approved a separate request for county matching funds to  repave Avenida Pico, between Calle de Los Molinos and Calle Frontera, a heavily  traveled area from the freeway to San Clemente High School.  </P> <P> If county officials agree, the city would pay $475,000 toward the project from  its share of state gasoline tax revenue. The rest of the money would come from  the county's Arterial Highway Financing Program. WENDY PAULSON  </P></p>

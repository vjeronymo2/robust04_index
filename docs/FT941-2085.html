			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / France warns student rioters The Balladur government yesterday asked teachers to keep their students off the streets where they have been contesting a youth wage law and warned that if they did not, serious injuries might result. But students in the south-eastern city of Lyons yesterday held their fourth demonstration in less than a week against the law. In its final version published yesterday, it permits employers to pay unskilled young people 80 per cent of the national minimum wage for working 80 per cent of a normal 39-hour work week, with the other 20 per cent devoted to training. The government's aim is to make France's jobless young, numbering some 800,000 now, more employable. Dozens of protesters have been arrested demonstrating against the measures in the past week and at least 19 have been sentenced in court to up to six months in jail. During three days of demonstrations in Lyons, capped by pitched battles on Monday, 35 policemen were injured and 73 people detained. In Nantes, 21 policemen were injured when about 300 young people broke away from an estimated 4,000 protesters and fought for more than four hours with police. Mr Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior minister, warned students not to let themselves be manipulated by left-wing politicians and unions, adding: 'It is the young people who will pay the price.' It was, in fact, an earlier version of the law, allowing employers to pay the same reduced wages to young people with university diplomas, that ignited the student revolt which has rumbled on despite the law's revision. Ex-president Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the UDF party in the government coalition, yesterday criticised 'the clumsy presentation' of the law, saying that its original version was 'discouraging' to students. Mr Michel Giraud, the labour minister, yesterday promised 'early initiatives to help the country's youth. He said that he and prime minister Edouard Balladur had been 'incensed' by what he called 'the political exploitation' of students' fears by trade unions and the Socialist and Communist parties. But in Toulouse, a city with 100,000 students and the highest university population outside Paris, this political connection was discounted. Professor Robert Marconis, a teacher at Toulouse-Le Mirail university, said that, in contrast to 1968 when students seized control of part of Paris for nearly a month, 'French students are more discouraged than politicised - more likely to be found reading L'Equipe (a sports paper) than Le Monde'. But he added: 'This is dangerous for the government because it is hard to know how to deal with it.'</p>

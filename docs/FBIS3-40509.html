			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. (IHI)  completed the F100-220E, an improved version of the F100-100 jet  engine for the Air Self-Defense Force's (ASDF) intercept fighter  F-15, and delivered the first engine to the Defense Agency on 29  October. The new engine is equipped with a digital electronics  control device (DEEC), which digitally controls all functions of  the engine. The new engine's main feature is that its  reliability and controllability have been substantially improved  over the F100 engine, which was developed in 1975.    The DEEC directly controls the engine pressure ratio (EPR),  using a computer to maintain the air-fuel ratio at the optimum  level under all flight conditions. As a result, full engine  performance is guaranteed at every instance to enable the pilot  to control the throttle with complete freedom. Moreover, the  DEEC contributes to the improvement of serviceability and  durability, as well as life-cycle cost.    IHI will deliver a total of nine engines this fiscal year to  the Defense Agency, including the first one it just delivered,  and 17 additional engines during the next fiscal year.</p>

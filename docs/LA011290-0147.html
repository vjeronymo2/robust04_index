			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> PAY, HEALTH BENEFITS STALL TEACHERS' PACT  </P> <P> With more than 200 teachers marching and chanting outside, representatives from  the Ocean View School District and its teachers union made little headway  Thursday in resolving their contract dispute.  </P> <P> After more than seven hours of negotiations with state mediator Tom McCarthy  and an exchange of proposals, the two sides remain "$1 million apart," said  Gayle Wayne, assistant to the district superintendent.  </P> <P> Carol Halbach, president of the Ocean View Teachers Assn., said she was "very  disappointed" with the lack of progress.  </P> <P> Teachers from the district's 17 Huntington Beach schools, which serve 8,400  students, picketed for 90 minutes in front of the district offices, carrying  signs and chanting, "We want a contract."  </P> <P> McCarthy directed both sides to continue to exchange proposals next week, and  if no settlement in the 10-week dispute is reached by next Friday, he will  authorize a fact-finding effort, the next step in the process.  </P> <P> The major issues at stake include teachers' salaries and health benefits, and  how money from the state lottery and Proposition 98 will be spent. The union's  latest proposal calls for a 9.3% pay raise and full health benefits.  </P> <P> The district countered with an offer that did not address salaries and included  an increased contribution to health coverage.  </P> <P> The district paid for health care for its employees until this school year,  when the cost of its Blue Shield plan soared 50% -- a cost that was passed on  to the teachers.

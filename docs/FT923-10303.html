			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Japan offers slice of inaction: Two telecoms stocks now open to foreign ownership Japan will from tomorrow offer foreign investors a rare opportunity: the right to own the worst performing stock of recent years in the Nikkei index of the country's 225 biggest listed companies. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), the domestic telecommunications group, came to the market five and a half years ago in a partial privatisation. Foreigners were barred from direct shareholding and Japanese flocked to the issue. Nearly 1.7m individual shareholders are now holding stock which soon after its debut traded at Y3.18m (Pounds 13,000) apiece, but then fell to stand yesterday at Y595,000, half the price at which the initial tranche was floated. Its fall has been longer and deeper than that of the market as measured by the Nikkei, which after a further rally yesterday stood 60 per cent below its December 1989 peak. But because of the high initial asking price, NTT still trades on a premium price/earnings ratio of a prospective 70, about double that for the market as a whole. The importance of NTT lies in its sheer size. With annual revenues equivalent to Pounds 26bn (it dwarfs all world telephone companies except AT&amp;T. Its market value is a still towering Y9,282bn and is thus a key component of the Nikkei average. Anyone hoping to build a portfolio matching the Tokyo market would need their quota of NTT. Foreigners have long held shares in NTT - and in Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD), the smaller international telecoms carrier, ownership restrictions on which are also being lifted from August 1. They have merely held them in unregistered form. Tomorrow's changes, which allow a maximum foreign holding of 20 per cent in each, will have two main consequences for overseas investors: In registering their holdings they will be able to collect the annual dividend. This had been no great loss anyway - Japan's payout ratio is low and in the case of NTT, the Y5,000 per share annual distribution represents a yield of around 0.8 per cent. Some foreigners are said to have circumvented the restrictions by opening nominee accounts with Japanese securities houses, which would hold the shares under the brokerages' name and pass on the dividend with fees deducted. More importantly, the deregulation will allow holding of the shares by institutional funds previously prevented by law - as in the US and some European countries - from buying stock which they could not register. Analysts still suspect, however, that many of those which wanted an exposure to NTT would have found their way around the barrier. There are few signs of pent-up buying enthusiasm from abroad. At Nomura Securities, Japan's biggest stockbroker, an official says 'hopefully the NTT share price will go up' but adds: 'I think there won't be much buying demand.' Mr Masashi Kojima, NTT president, said that he had met some US investment bank chairmen whom he thought regarded it as 'an interesting company for the medium-term'. 'I get a feeling . . . that foreign investors have a big interest in NTT stock.' Any 'medium-term' view would have to take account of the uncertain outlook for the Tokyo stock market as economic slowdown sets in, and also the effects of increased competition on the companies' earnings prospects. Mr Jason James, a strategist with the London stockbroker James Capel, acknowledges that 'you can make a case for NTT - on four times cash flow it is cheap relative to foreign phone companies'. (BT, by comparison, is priced at a cash-flow multiple of around five). But Mr James detects 'no great deal of enthusiasm about either NTT or KDD in terms of fundamentals'. NTT is forecasting a 24.3 per cent fall in parent pre-tax profits to Y267bn in the year to next March, accelerating from a 14.8 per cent slide last year. While the government continues to control many telephone charges - the Y10 three-minute local call is one of Japan's best bargains - so-called new common carriers have been allowed to mop up business by discounting on its most important inter-city long-distance routes. Yesterday Mr Kojima announced that on at least some routes the price gap with its competitor consortia, which the company has been steadily narrowing, would be eliminated by October next year. NTT has also been lobbying the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications  - so far to no avail - to allow a reform of its rate structure based more on the cost of providing each service, including ancillaries such as directory assistance which lose money. KDD, after a flat 1991, expects a 3.7 per cent rise in profits this year to Y27bn on revenues of Y259bn, in the face of slowing growth in the volume of calls. It says that since the partial opening up of the country's telecoms market in the late 1980s it has now adjusted to life with its two rivals, competing on service rather than price. Unlike its larger sibling, KDD has had a Tokyo listing for more than 30 years. Opening ownership of the two to foreigners is arguably an optimistic quest to stem the slide in the market, and indeed was not set in train until the downturn began, in 1990. For the companies themselves, there will be two main effects. First, they may seek to list their shares on foreign exchanges in the hope of broadening recognition. Second, they may offer equity-linked bonds in the Euromarkets - assuming there is any appetite. But any significant upturn in the NTT share price would, notes Capel's Mr James, meet 'a huge overhang of disgruntled individual shareholders who had lost several thousand pounds each' and were looking to get out. Moreover, foreign predators with Pounds 8bn or so to spend and an eye on what a one-fifth slice of NTT might bring should have their ardour cooled by three further facts. Japan's muscular Ministry of Finance retains a two-thirds stake. By law, it cannot let this holding fall below one third (in the current trading climate the sale of a further tranche has anyway been indefinitely postponed). And, again by law, foreigners are banned from its board.</p>

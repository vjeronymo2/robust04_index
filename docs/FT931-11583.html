			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Arts: Today's Television People who prefer pandas will want to see the latest episode of The Ark (BBC 2, 9.25). Waving a bouquet of withered bamboo at her fans, Ming Ming arrives at the crumbling establishment in Regent's Park, at the same time that other animals are being crated up and shiped out. Whether one likes zoos or loathes them, it remains the case that director Molly Dineen has produced an inventive, well-crafted film dealing with what may well be the last days of London Zoo. If you missed My Beautiful Laundrette (C4, 10.00), now is the night to catch a thoughtful and highly atmospheric film which gives a memorable picture of London. Tonight sees the last episode of Europe means Business: The Apprentices of Dresden (BBC2, 5.00), the worthwhile series revealing the cogs of business live in united Germany. The apprentices in question are of the Dresdner Bank, opening new branches in the former East where savings accounts used to pay only 3.25 per cent and personal accounts were unknown. Out of Sight, Out of Mind in the First Tuesday series (ITV, 10.40) goes over familiar territory for the socially-concerned film-maker.</p>

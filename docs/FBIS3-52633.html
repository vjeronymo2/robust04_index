			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Tamil Nadu Assembly has passed two bills making  the chief minister chancellor of all the 13 universities in the  state in place of the governor. Replying to the debate, the  education minister, Mr. K. Ponnuswamy, allayed fears there would  be interference in the day-to-day functioning of the  universities. He claimed that it is well within the legislative  competence and jurisdiction of the house to make the chief  minister chancellor of the universities.    The Congress-I, the Janata Party, the CPI [Communist Party  of  India], the CPI-M [Communist Party of India-Marxist] and the MGR  Anna DMK [M.G. Ramachandran Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]  parties have criticized the Tamil Nadu Government for violating  federal principles and showing disrespect to the governor by  bringing forward the bills. They expressed the view the bills  would pave the way for encroachment in the day-to-day  functioning of the universities.</p>

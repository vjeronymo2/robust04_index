			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Currency effect assists in Eurotrack recovery BOURSES generally recovered from the depths they hit on Monday afternoon, when the Dow dropped 100 points in early trading, writes Our Markets Staff. However, the 1.8 per cent rise in the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index, which is expressed in terms of D-Marks, also owed something to the recovery of other currencies against their German counterpart. FRANKFURT's recovery was not immediately apparent, as the DAX index closed down 4.10 at a new 1992 closing low of 1,420.30, but dealers noted that there had been an indicated break below 1,400 in the post-bourse on Monday. There was no obvious pattern, either, to individual or sector share price levels. In carmakers, after Monday's earnings downgrades and general gloom, BMW recovered DM7 to DM460 and Continental, an industry supplier, by DM4.50 to DM194.50; but Daimler dropped DM7.50 to DM525.50 and Volkswagen by DM4.60 to DM258.60. Similarly, in chemicals BASF gained DM3.40 marks to DM204 while Bayer and Hoechst were both slightly lower. A 0.4 per cent fall in western German manufacturing orders in August did nothing to brighten the outlook. Siemens slipped DM7.40 to DM546.00. The company said yesterday that its automation division had produced lower profits for 1991-92, but gave no specific figures. PARIS had another volatile day, the CAC-40 index dipping as low as 1,586.11 before ending 1.47 better at 1,612.51. Turnover was moderate at FFr2.6bn, and trading was dominated by arbitrage activity. Hachette surged 20.2 per cent or FFr23.80 to FFr141.80 on speculation about the share parity when the media company is merged with its sister company, Matra. Other gainers included Total, up FFr7.20 or 3.6 per cent to FFr205.60, on bargain-hunting in the wake of its recent weakness. Eurotunnel slowed after Monday's sharp fall, closing FFr1.10 lower at FFr29.25. AMSTERDAM was broadly positive, and the CBS Tendency index ended 1.6 or 1.5 per cent higher at 107.7. DAF rose on publication of an interview with the group's chairman but subsided later as investors found little new in the comments. It closed up 60 cents at Fl 12.60. Heineken, Fl 2.10 better at Fl 167.30, was boosted by its decision to initiate exports to Germany in the new year. However, James Capel reiterated a hold note yesterday, forecasting 'a noticeable slowdown in earnings growth over the next 12 months'. MILAN ended widely mixed in a session dominated by speculative buying of a number of potential takeover stocks. Dealers added that some institutions used yesterday's technical bounce to continue to lighten their positions. The Comit index rose 2.74 to 361.11 in turnover estimated at L120bn after L111.7bn. Speculation that Fiat would sell off non-core assets to strengthen its balance sheet sent the retailer Rinascente and Snia BPD, a diversified chemical group, sharply higher. Rinascente soared L410 or 10 per cent to L4,460 while Snia also added 10 per cent or L75 to L805 at its official fixing, though it fell back to L765 later. Stet recovered L45 or 4.3 per cent to L1,080 after Monday's heavy fall. MADRID took heart after the government said that it was not planning to raise interest rates in the short term. The general index rose 3.67 to 183.15. Banks were boosted by BBV's decision to increase its quarterly dividend by Pta2 to Pta38 as its shares rose Pta75 to Pta2,015. STOCKHOLM featured a SKr7.50 gain to SKr48 for Proventus B after the investment company proposed redeeming outstanding shares at SKr50. The Affarsvarlden General index rose 4.1 to 643.1 in turnover of SKr422m after SKr443m. In the forestry sector, Stora B shares dropped another SKr10 to SKr165 following its earnings report on Monday. ZURICH liked the drop in the Swiss inflation rate, which fed through into lower domestic interest rates, higher bank shares and a recovery in the SMI index of 33.2, or 1.9 per cent to 1,820.5. UBS rose SFr12 to SFr766, and SBC SFr6 to SFr275. HELSINKI saw a sharp fall in bank shares as the Hex index closed 6.4 lower at 603.1. The banks and finance index dropped another 19.3 per cent, KOP free shares falling FM1.2 to FM3.8 and Unitas B FM1.6 to FM2.7. After hours it was reported that IBCA, a ratings agency, might cut its ratings on Kop, Unitas and Postipankki. Bank and shipping shares led COPENHAGEN lower as the all-share index fell 3.28 to 258.02, writes Hilary Barnes. Danske Bank was down DKr8 to DKr226 and Unidanmark fell DKr5 to DKr111. AP Moller's D/S 1912 B fell DKr1,000 to DKr71,800. VIENNA remained in an uncertain mood as the ATX index eased 0.90 to 768.55. Austrian Airlines was one of the day's main gainers, up Sch50 or 2.6 per cent at Sch1,920. ISTANBUL retreated 2.7 per cent to its second consecutive three-month low as the release of disappointing inflation data on Sunday continued to weigh on sentiment. The 75-share index fell 105.12 to 3,814.18.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - OCT 6                            Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------    Open   11.30am   12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     4 pm    close  952.35   954.28   956.94   954.81   956.60   953.39  954.13   954.29                    Day's High  957.89     Day's Low  952.26            Oct 5     Oct 2      Oct 1     Sep 30     Sep 29           937.42     993.56    1006.01    1003.44    1009.98  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

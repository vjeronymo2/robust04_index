			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Insurers active on switching Leading life assurance companies saw exceptionally heavy trade yesterday as a technical view on relative performance clashed with the attitude towards long-term prospects. Several leading securities houses had noted that Legal &amp; General had underperformed the broad market by 5 per cent over the past month, while Prudential had outperformed by the same amount. However, heavy switching was counterbalanced by the feeling that L&amp;G was more prone to regulatory changes surrounding the selling of pensions. And the 'feel bad factor' was compounded by Tuesday's news that its US subsidiary faces an Dollars 8.7m fine. The chartists won the day. L&amp;G gained 3 at 431p on turnover of 7.9m, while Prudential slipped a penny to 320p on unusually high trade of 13m.</p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Observer: Rocks on the box Don't show your age by talking about 'engagement' rings. They're out, sneers De Beers, because golden youth now associates them with fusty family-arranged marriages. Today's people talk of 'commitment' rings, adds the world's top diamond-producer, about to launch its biggest television advertising campaign in Europe at a cost of Pounds 8.5m. But while making much play with the new 'in' word, the ads will emphasise that, whatever the changes in terminological fashion, diamonds are for ever. And it just so happens that the first showing in the UK, on Monday, will be during a re-run of the James Bond movie with the same name.</p>

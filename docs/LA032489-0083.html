			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: SAVORING NORTH ITALIAN CUISINE IN NORTH COUNTY  </P> <P> When it opened a few years ago, Scalini was particularly attractive as the  destination of a Sunday drive in the country.  </P> <P> The restaurant still looks across Via de la Valle at polo grounds and open  fields, but the nearby hillsides that formerly grew dun-colored brush and  sprinklings of wildflowers now sprout expensive housing tracts. In its mood and  menu, Scalini seems well able to match its neighborhood as the landscape  becomes progressively more urban.  </P> <P> The place always has been somewhat urbane, especially during the racing season,  when many of its patrons smelled of thoroughbreds, Kentucky blue grass and the  Saratoga turf club; in fact, the formality of the dining room and the casual  tone of the clientele combined to produce a sense of sophistication rarely  found in these parts. At the time, the menu was pleasantly ahead of itself, and  if other Italian houses in North County have caught up, Scalini has held its  own. A couple of recent visits turned up cooking that was consistently  well-prepared and well-presented.  </P> <P> The common denominator that unites the disparate styles and elements of Italian  cookery is garlic, and if one enters on a busy night it is the scent of garlic  sizzling in olive oil that forms a first and lasting impression of Scalini.  Most of the entrees, which are relatively restrained and "northern" in their  approach, avoid garlic, but first courses and pastas are transformed by an  almost abandoned use of it.  </P> <P> A primary example of the way garlic can change the direction of a dish is the  penne all'arrabiata ("raging" pasta). This is a common Italian presentation of  tube-shaped macaroni tossed with a lightly cooked tomato sauce spiked with bits  of hot red pepper. A little garlic usually seasons the sauce, but Scalini  throws in a large spoonful of coarsely chopped, raw garlic, which supplies a  sensation of heat quite different from that touched off by the peppers. The  result is delicious, with the only caveat that the penne may not make the best  prelude to a social situation.  </P> <P> The antipasto table also includes tidbits that sigh with garlic's heavy breath.  Especially notable here are the the slices of eggplant and zucchini that have  been grilled, then marinated in olive oil. Topped with slivers of strong, musky  Parmesan, these vegetables make particularly savory mouthfuls. The buffet  usually offers six or seven items -- sliced tomatoes with fresh mozzarella and  basil leaves, a cloying chicken salad in homemade mayonnaise, excellent  marinated olives, a cold compote of chick peas and tuna -- and a little of each  will be included on the antipasto plate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Elegant Pizzas  </P> <P> The kitchen puts a great deal of emphasis on starters, and, in addition to the  cold antipasti, it turns out sauteed shrimp finished in the arrabiata style;  puff pastry filled with shellfish in a creamed tomato sauce; snails served in a  fashion similar to the "bourguignon" style that turns up on so many menus, but  here with the addition of mixed herbs, and steamed mussels in a broth flavored  with herbs, garlic and tomato.  </P> <P> Four rather elegant pizzas make prime candidates to be shared as first courses,  but because the restaurant often serves a round of dough topped with olive oil,  garlic, salt and basil as a snack while guests read the menu, the pizzas can  seem rather beside the point. Nonetheless, it is an impressive selection that  begins with the Margherita (according to Neapolitans, the one true pizza), a  pie topped simply with tomato, mozzarella, basil and oregano. More elaborate  versions include the "moskovskaya," a theoretically Russian variation topped  with cream cheese, smoked salmon and caviar, and the house special, which  combines sun-dried tomatoes with cheese and sweet peppers.  </P> <P> The pasta list perhaps takes itself too seriously because it excludes the  simple, classic sauce of quickly cooked tomatoes seasoned with nothing more  than a little basil and salt. Spaghetti or vermicelli topped with a bit of this  at times seems the perfect kickoff to an Italian meal, and it is a little  surprising to not find it on an otherwise far-ranging menu.  </P> <P> There is a close cousin to it, though, the capelini Santa Margherita, or thin  pasta tossed with chopped raw tomato, basil, mozzarella and garlic. There is a  pleasing lightness to this dish, even though it is rather substantial. The  pasta mood grows racy with the fusilli alla Mediterranea, or twists in a spicy  sauce of sausage, cured black olives, tomato and seasonings, and mellow with  the elegantly restrained ravioli boscaiola, which swim in a tomatoed cream  sauce filled out with porcini mushrooms and bits of Italian pancetta bacon.  </P> <P> Entrees definitely take the tone identified these days as "Northern Italian,"  but, despite the general restraint there are plenty of such typical accents as  lemon, rosemary and other strong herbs and garlic.  </P> <P> Grilled fresh salmon arrives in dill sauce, grilled swordfish with capers and  lemon butter and sauteed scallops in a sauce of grain mustard and cream, and  any of these preparations would be equally at home in a French restaurant. More  specifically Italian are the excellent grilled lamb chops, beautifully crusted  and redolent of rosemary and garlic; the sea bass amalfitana, finished with a  fresh tomato sauce, olives and basil, and the veal scallops in a choice of  lemon butter or Marsala sauce.  </P> <P> The most interesting-sounding veal dish, the vitello Scalini, was one of the  kitchen's less successful offerings, because it featured a gravy-like sauce  that appeared to have been thickened with flour, something generally not done  in Italian sautes. It also went shy on an advertised component, eggplant,  offering only a tiny scrap of it under the coverlet of prosciutto melted  fontina cheese that draped the sauteed veal scallops.  </P> <P> The menu closes extravagantly with lobster fra diavola, a spicy dish that  includes a brandy flambe in its preparation, and with the interesting hybrid  called filetto Rossini. The Italians claim this decidedly French combination of  grilled beef filet, foie gras, truffles and brown sauce as their own, because  it was the notorious favorite of composer Giacomo Rossini.  </P> <P> The dessert tray is the one perfunctory presentation of the meal. It includes  profiteroles, the French dessert of ice cream-stuffed cream puffs, and  tiramisu, the very Roman dessert of whipped mascarpone cheese, flavored here  with powdered espresso. It is creamy, but not very exciting.  </P></p>

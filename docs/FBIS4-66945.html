			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] La Paz, 27 Apr (EFE) -- Bolivian President  Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada has stated that Bolivia is running the  risk of becoming the target of "narco-guerrilla" actions.    In a statement published by the La Paz newspaper ULTIMA HORA  today, Sanchez de Lozada explained that in Chapare, a region in  the central part of Cochabamba Department, "the atmosphere is  ripe for the establishment of drug cartels or the operations of  narco- guerrilla groups." [passage omitted]    Sanchez de Lozada stated that "all coca leaves produced" in  the Chapare region are used to manufacture cocaine, not for the  traditional and legal uses of this leaf. [passage omitted]    Sanchez de Lozada also announced that his administration  wants to draft a new drug enforcement policy in coordination  with the United States Government.    "This is very important for them (the North Americans),  because even though they have acknowledged after many years that  the responsibility for this situation should be shared, we must  come up with a proposal capable of truly resolving this  problem," the Bolivian president said.    Sanchez de Lozada agreed that drug trafficking is one of  Bolivia's most serious problems, and stressed that it  jeopardizes Bolivia's relations with the rest of the world.</p>

			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / People: Waterways Ombudsman Lady Ponsonby of Shulbrede has been appointed Waterways Ombudsman, largely, she believes, on the strength of her experience as a barrister and arbitrator. Every year millions of people use Britain's canals: boaters, anglers, and freight carriers. If they have cause to complain of maladministration by British Waterways, the nationalised body that runs the canals, reservoirs, towpaths and buildings, they have recourse to BW's complaints procedure. If still not satisfied, Lady Ponsonby is their last resort. No one really knows how busy she may turn out to be; British Waterways says it keeps no overall record of how many moaners it gets annually. But Lady Ponsonby is not one of them; she acknowledges never having taken a canal boat holiday, 'though I have walked along a good few towpaths'. During her three-year contract, Lady Ponsonby, 61, plans to stir the waters a bit: 'British Waterways will have to abide by my decisions, and if they don't like them, too bad - they're stuck with me,' she says.</p>

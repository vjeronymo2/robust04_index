			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Buoyant Sandoz raises turnover to SFr14.4bn SANDOZ, the Swiss pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, yesterday shrugged off the slow-down in the world economy when it announced turnover up 8 per cent from SFr13.35bn (Dollars 9.5bn) to SFr14.42bn for 1992. The improvement was mainly driven by the pharmaceuticals and nutrition divisions. Profit figures were not given, but Sandoz said it expected the operating performance of the divisional companies to result in a substantial rise in group profits. In 1991, the group generated net profits of SFr1.1bn. Pharmaceuticals sales improved 9 per cent from SFr6.27bn to SFr6.87bn, driven chiefly by prescription medicines. The over-the-counter business also did well, the company said. In local currencies, the rise was also 9 per cent. Sandoz's nutrition division's turnover rose 13 per cent from SFr1.54bn to SFr1.75bn. Turnover in the chemicals division increased 4 per cent from SFr2.36bn to SFr2.45bn. Most of the growth was in the Americas and Asia. The agrochemicals division suffered from the reform of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy. However, the introduction of new products helped sales increase 6 per cent from SFr1.16bn to SFr1.23bn. In local currencies turnover rose 3 per cent. Revenues from the seeds division increased 7 per cent from SFr950m to SFr1.02bn. In local currencies the increase was 3 per cent. The construction and environment division's turnover improved 3 per cent from SFr1.07bn to SFr1.1bn, despite low construction volume.</p>

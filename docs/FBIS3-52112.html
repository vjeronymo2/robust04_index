This official visit will come on the heels of recent talks  held between His Majesty King Husayn and the Palestinian  president, during which the Palestinian side affirmed its  concern to maintain the special Palestinian-Jordanian  relationship regardless of the impediments entailed.    In a separate development, Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam  al-Majali received at his office yesterday Dr. George Habash,  secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine, who arrived in Amman the day before yesterday.    AL-WATAN has learned that there is currently a consensus  within the Palestinian side, particularly the PLO leadership,  that the Israeli leaders will maintain their procrastination and  prevarication regarding the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho  accord, and that it is in the interest of the Palestinians to  coordinate with various Palestinian factions and forces to  ensure harmony within the Palestinian camp, and also to enhance  the relationship with Jordan and other Arab sides.</p>

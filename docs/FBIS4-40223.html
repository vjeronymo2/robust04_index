			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, at the house of parliament, the NATO  delegation led by General Peter Heinrich Carstens, chief of  staff of Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe [SHAPE], was  received. In the conversation that took place, deputy speaker  Kuanysh Sultanov told the guest that Kazakhstan's new foreign  policy is based on that of a non-nuclear country. The  parliament, he stressed, endorsed the fundamentals of the  defense doctrine. Much attention is paid to building and  developing the armed forces. He expressed hope for the  possibility of cooperation with all NATO member states for the  sake of preserving peace and good relations.    The general spoke about the concept of the Partnership for  Peace program and its future development. He expressed  satisfaction that three Central Asian states, including  Kazakhstan, signed the document on cooperation in the framework  of their program. At its early stage, establishment of  political contacts is envisaged. In September, the first joint  military training exercise will take place, and observers from  Kazakhstan are invited to participate.</p>

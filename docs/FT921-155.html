			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / UK Company News: 'Miraculous' restructuring of Brent Walker is finalised THE Pounds 1.65bn financial restructuring of Brent Walker was finalised a little after 5pm yesterday when the last of several hundred documents arrived safely at the offices of Hill Samuel, the leisure group's merchant bank. Lord Kindersley, Brent Walker chairman, said that the restructuring was 'little short of miraculous against the background of the deepest and longest recession of post-war history'. He said the company would now work to re-establish some value for shareholders, although he warned that this would take a long time to achieve. Mr Richard Heley, head of corporate finance at Hill Samuel, said it was 'outstanding that the patience of the banks has held together in view of the enormous complexity involved in putting the rescue in place'. The rescue is the largest in UK corporate history and fees involved are expected to total nearly Pounds 50m. It became necessary because Brent Walker's borrowings had far outstripped its ability to service them. Its troubles became apparent in the autumn of1990 and a standstill agreement was reached with its banks in November, with a view to a full restructuring following. Talks on that got under way in February 1991 but have taken until now to complete. Today sees the start of trading in new shares being issued as part of the restructuring. The banks are converting Pounds 250m of the group's loans into equity, and bond and preference shareholders are also receiving new shares. The old shares fell 2p to 8 1/2 p yesterday. In supplementary listing particulars for the share issue, posted over the weekend, Brent Walker details the claims made against the company by Mr George Walker, its former chairman and chief executive, who was ousted last May. He has claimed Pounds 10.3m in compensation for the loss of office, while Mrs Jean Walker, his wife and another former director, has claimed Pounds 396,000 and Mr Jason Walker, their son, has claimed Pounds 222,000. In addition Mr Walker has claimed that Brent Walker agreed to indemnify him if he was required to meet an indemnity he had given to Lonrho, the international trading group, which had bought Pounds 5m of a Pounds 101.9m convertible bond issue. Mr Walker had promised Lonrho that it could sell the bonds back to him. Brent Walker said it was invest-igating the claim and 'has sought clarification from Mr Walker'. The document also shows that the Pounds 350m William Hill loan has had its maturity shortened from December 13 1994 to March 1 1994. This will give lenders a chance to assess the 1993 results and then see if they want to refinance the loan. The group has also found a way round the problem of a Pounds 50m payment due to Grand Metropolitan, the leisure group, which is the final instalment of the Pounds 685m purchase price of William Hill. GrandMet, which was an unsecured creditor, has been given a position in the ranking hierarchy. Of the total, Pounds 20m is ranked near the top of the cascade, with accrued interest lower down and the remaining Pounds 30m near the bottom. Brent Walker now hopes to re-start negotiations with GrandMet over its claim for a refund of part of the purchase price of William Hill.</p>

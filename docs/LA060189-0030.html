			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR COINS: QUARTER EAGLE HAS A FLOCK OF ADMIRERS  </P> <P> Question: I have a United States gold $2 1/2 coin dated 1926. It appears to be  in excellent condition, with an Indian on one side and an eagle on the other. I  would appreciate knowing its value. -- S.K.  </P> <P> Answer: United States gold coins traditionally are called eagles by collectors.  The $20 piece is a double eagle, the $10 is an eagle, the $5 a half eagle and  the $2 1/2 a quarter eagle. Quarter eagles are interesting because of the odd  denomination and also because they've had a long numismatic run -- from 1796 to  1929. A hobbyist could easily spend a lifetime pursuing this interesting piece.  Early dates are especially elusive and expensive.  </P> <P> It is believed that the reason for the $2 1/2 gold piece was to have a  denomination between the silver dollar and the $5 half eagle. Because of its  longevity, the quarter eagle has undergone many design changes, everything from  the capped bust to the capped head to the classic head to the coronet type to  the Indian head design. There are also many varieties and mints represented in  this series.  </P> <P> Your 1926 $2 1/2 is an Indian head type that was produced intermittently from  1908 to 1929, the last year of issue. There were 446,000 quarter eagles minted  in 1926 and unless your coin is a gem or a high-grade uncirculated piece, it's  probably worth about $150 to $300.  </P> <P> Coin News  </P> <P> The third coin (pictured) in a series that began in 1987 commemorating Pope  John Paul II is being issued by the Warsaw Mint. The new Polish piece, dated  1989, features intricate beveled edges and, when the design catches light, the  reflection of a Christian cross as a background for the Pope's image. Mintages  are expected to be low: a four-coin silver proof set (1,500 sets), 12-ounce  proof gold (300 pieces), and for the first time a proof platinum coin (1,000  pieces).

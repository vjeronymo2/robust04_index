			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV AND THE DEATH OF A COLONEL  </P> <P> I agree wholeheartedly with Rosenberg's viewpoint. I was insulted for Higgins  and his family.  </P> <P> Why does television insist on using "tabloid attraction" instead of discretion?  Why not grant Higgins dignity by showing a photo of him taken prior to the  kidnaping?  </P> <P> At the very least, there should have been a warning to viewers before showing  the videotape of Higgins' hanged body.  </P> <P> NBC and ABC both opened up their news program with a still photograph of the  hanging. I wonder how quickly network executives would be to put on such a  photograph if it had been one of their relatives? Sadly, I have a feeling that  if it meant high ratings, they wouldn't hesitate.  </P> <P> EILEEN O'REILLY  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

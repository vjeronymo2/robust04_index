			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (22): Easing the shackles - Profile: P. S. Sangma HE WILL not make the final decisions. But as acting labour minister, Mr P. S. Sangma will be highly influential in the government's formulation of controversial policies to deal with sick units and their workers in the public sector, and to ease the shackles imposed on industry to deal with surplus employees, writes Michael Smith. The deliberations are among the most difficult the government faces. In India, jobs have traditionally been viewed as the preserve of the holder for his or her working life. The political sensitivities that surround the issues have already contributed to the departure, several months ago, of Mr P. Ramamurthi, Mr Sangma's predecessor at the labour ministry. Mr P. V. Narasimha Rao, prime minister, thought to be considering a significant re-shuffle of his cabinet, took on the job himself for a short period, but then decided to appoint an acting replacement. Mr Sangma was familiar with the brief, having been labour minister in 1986-87. Still only 44, he has wide experience in government, although below cabinet level. A lawyer by profession, he was elected to parliament in 1977 at the age of 29. When Congress I was next returned to power, in 1980, he became a deputy minister and served in that post in industry and foreign affairs before becoming minister of state (home). Like many other government ministers, Mr Sangma returned to his home state when Congress I lost power. In his case he was chief minister in Maghalaya for three years before Congress I was returned to power last year. He was then appointed coal minister, a non-cabinet job which he retains alongside his labour brief. Mr Sangma visibly enjoys the cut and thrust of parliamentary debate, and can often be seen smiling when confronted with challenging questions. But his approach to his ministerial jobs is by no means adversarial. Although he jokes about the lack of unity among trade unions - 'there are nine trade union centres, and that makes it easier for us: we can make them fight each other' - he says he is trying to impress upon union leaders the need to work together. 'It would give them more bargaining power,' he explains. 'For any honest employer, it is better to have one union than several to deal with. If the unions are united, it is better for the working classes.' Mr Sangma says he is in favour of the unions, though on one condition: that the leadership should come from the workers themselves, and not from political parties. The government is proposing legislation which would limit outsiders on union executives (including MPs) to 10 per cent of the leadership. Although this may meet union opposition, the bigger fights will be over the public-sector sick units and any amendments to labour laws. Mr Sangma, who chairs the tripartite committee to consider the impact of the new industrial policy on labour issues, has tried to allay the fears of unions, by telling them that the government intends to 'safeguard the interest of workers'. The government would like to rationalise labour through voluntary retirement, retraining and redeployment, he says. Mr Sangma points to agreements such as that recently negotiated by him in the state-owned coal mines. Under this, workers have, for the first time, agreed that any new mines shall take only 30 per cent of their employees from new recruits to the industry. The rest will come from other mines where they are viewed as surplus labour. The problem with the 58 sick units earmarked for modernisation is that their financial position is already tenuous, and some would be considered unviable in other countries. Mr Sangma says he hopes most of the units can be revived. 'In a few cases, where there is no chance of revival, we are willing to hand them over to workers' co-operatives, and we will write off all the past losses and liabilities and give them finance.' And if that does not work? 'We will see later on,' replies Mr Sangma. He laughs his infectious laugh, but in a way that suggests he realises that that will be the crucial test of government policy.</p>

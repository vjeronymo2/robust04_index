Tsui Tsin-tong, chairman of the New China Hong Kong Group  Ltd., made the remark at a contract-signing ceremony on the  building of a four-lane 90-km express highway linking Chengdu,  capital of south-west China's Sichuan Province, with Mianyang  city.    Tsui is also a member of the Standing Committee of the  National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference and an adviser on Hong Kong affairs to  the State Council, China's highest governing body.    The Hong Kong company will pay for 60 percent of the nearly  1.4 billion yuan (about 160.9 million U.S. dollars) total cost  of the freeway project, which is the largest cooperative project  between Sichuan and overseas investors.    Tsui was of the view that at present most overseas  businessmen tend to put their money into China's coastal areas,  and into the real estate sector in particular, and that such an  investment pattern is improper anyway. It will only result in  greater discrepancies between rich and poor areas.    He believed that responsible and farsighted industrialists  had better invest in China's broad inland areas to improve local  infrastructure facilities by building more highways, ports and  similar facilities, and they would certainly get profitable  returns.    Taking Sichuan as an example, Tsui said that the province  has  a population of more than 100 million, and its annual retail  sales total is only next to Guangdong, one of the economically  booming provinces in China. In addition, Sichuan has abundant  mineral resources and various other products, together with an  industrial, scientific and technological might. An upgraded  infrastructure would certainly lead to the province's fast  economic growth.    Previously, Mr. Tsui has established an automobile company  and an investment and development company in Sichuan Province,  both of which are running well.    He said that while investing more in the inland areas of  China, he will also motivate more other overseas funds to these  areas.    Together with Tsui, an inspection group of some 70 people,  including 15 representatives of large Hong Kong banking firms,  showed great interest in investing here.</p>

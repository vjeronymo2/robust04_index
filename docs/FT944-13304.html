			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Army may be sent after Rio drug barons Brazil is considering sending its armed forces into Rio de Janeiro's shanty towns to combat the city's drug traffickers amid widespread concern that the police have lost control and are heavily involved in corruption. Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, due to take over as president on January 1, yesterday added to calls for the outgoing administration to act. He said he favoured military intervention in Rio, which he described as being in a state of 'undeclared civil war'. Calls for troop deployments have been welcomed by Rio residents who are tired of the city's spiral of violence and corruption. However, previous proposals have been blocked by Rio politicians, who fear losing power to the federal government. Outgoing President Itamar Franco now appears ready to act, but may not have enough political backing. Putting troops on the streets would be controversial given Brazil's unpleasant memories of 21 years of military rule which ended in 1985. The latest proposal follows a shoot-out 10 days ago in a Rio shanty town in which police killed 13 people, including a two-year-old boy. Police said they were hunting drug traffickers who had attacked a police station a few days earlier. However, fights between police and drugs gangs are more often caused by competition for control over drug networks. Following the incident, the justice ministry and armed forces sent Mr Franco a confidential report thought to have raised the possibility of military intervention. A spokesman said the president was still 'analysing' the report and no action would be taken ahead of a scheduled meeting on Monday between the president and Mr Nilo Batista, Rio's governor. If Mr Batista requests intervention the federal government is thought ready to deploy troops quickly. If he opposes the plan, the government could take control of Rio state through a variety of constitutional mechanisms, which would allow it to strip him of his power. However, the outgoing government is thought reluctant to take such a measure because it would involve the temporary suspension of some constitutional rights and require congressional approval. This might not be forthcoming so close to the government's departure from office. Military leaders are believed to favour intervention, although they admit it could be risky. Most of Rio's drug traffickers live in the centre of the shanty towns. These are often perched on the top of hills and innocent bystanders would probably be caught in the crossfire if troops intervened. The military is also worried that a prolonged period of patrolling the shanty towns could lead to poorly paid troops being co-opted by drug traffickers, which is how corruption of the police force started.</p>

			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MEDIA OUT OF TOUCH WITH IRVINE CITIZENS  </P> <P> Your editorial "A Mayor or a Marshmallow" (Oct. 11) leads me to the conclusion  you're out of touch with the citizens of Irvine. The voters spoke by a 52%-48%  vote to not reelect Larry Agran.  </P> <P> You do a disservice to the city voters when you fail to recognize what in most  elections would be considered a landslide.  </P> <P> You're right when you said we failed to reelect an international diplomat in  Agran. I question your description, however. We defeated a man who put his own  political ambitions ahead of the interests of Irvine.  </P> <P> Every city with an elected mayor is governed by machine politics. Mayor Bradley  is out raising $750,000 to cover legal fees for his conflict-of-interest  lawsuit. Is Sacramento better now that we have paid career politicians  controlled by lobbyists, instead of our former citizen politicians?  </P> <P> I am a very independent voter -- and I'm not a supporter of Sally Anne Sheridan  -- but to call her a pothole-fixing mayor is demeaning. You should look at one  of the cleanest political cities in the United States -- Cincinnati -- the  mayor elected by fellow councilmen, no political machine, just honest  government serving the people.  </P> <P> We've got a lot of wounds to bind in this city. Your editorial contributes  nothing to it. It just illustrates that the media -- like Congress -- are out  of touch.  </P> <P> LESLIE J. RACEY, Irvine  </P></p>

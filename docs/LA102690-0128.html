			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAYING HOOKY;  </P> <P> IT'S AUTUMN -- BUT THE BEACH ISN'T OUT OF REACH  </P> <P> I was meandering along Ocean Front Walk in Venice on Thursday, trying to figure  out how some people steal a midweek day at the beach -- especially a hot,  autumn, cliche-of-a-Southern-California day.  </P> <P> Then, on the walkway near where Venice Boulevard dead-ends into the Pacific, I  spied four teen-age girls from North Hollywood.  </P> <P> Hey, what about school?  </P> <P> "I'm the bad one," said a 16-year-old from North Hollywood High School. "I was  the one who first said, 'C'mon, let's ditch.' "  </P> <P> It was late October, she explained, the sky was baby blue, and temperatures  were 90-plus. The weather is expected to stay warm through the weekend. But the  beach-going foursome couldn't wait for the weekend.  </P> <P> I approached Todd Pulvino, 28, an engineer from Culver City who said he was  taking a day off from his job. He worked that out, he said, by telling a  supervisor the night before that he wanted to relax a bit after coming home  late from a business trip to Boston.  </P> <P> "The nice weather doesn't hurt, either," he said as he unloaded his 1-year-old  daughter, Christa, from the back seat of his bicycle. He was with his mother,  Carol Pulvino. The 53-year-old schoolteacher, visiting from Madison, Wis.,  marveled at the opportunity to wear short pants in the late fall.  </P> <P> Not everybody in Pulvino's family made it to the beach.  </P> <P> "My wife is a financial analyst," he said. "She had to go to the office at  about (6:45 a.m.). I think she was calling me a lazy bum when she left."  </P> <P> Then there were others snatching just an hour on the beach.  </P> <P> Barry Geier and co-worker James J. Burke, in shirts and ties, sat on the  basketball court bleachers on Ocean Front Walk eating hot-link sandwiches.  </P> <P> "Being inside felt like being in a cave," said Burke, a contracts specialist at  a Culver City electronics company. "The weather and the cramped feeling made me  want to get outside."  </P> <P> Geier, whose tie remained snug around his collar, said: "I've been working in  Culver City for about six years.  </P> <P> "This is the first time I've actually gone out and had lunch at the beach."  </P> <P> Then there was Mike Blumenthal, a wholesale candy and tobacco distributor who  didn't have time to take lunch. Armed with a clipboard binder, stuffed with  yellow invoice forms and accompanying carbon copies, he said he had a dozen  stops to make at shops along the walkway.  </P> <P> His determined stride relaxed a bit when I asked if he ever took time off from  his rounds to enjoy a balmy day.  </P> <P> "Well, I don't think that I work any less if the weather is good," he said,  implying that he was no slacker. "Let's just put it this way: If the day is  nice, I walk a little slower."  </P> <P> OK, OK, I thought, knowing that my time at the beach was just about up. Even  though I knew I had to go back to the office, I walked a little slower too.  </P></p>

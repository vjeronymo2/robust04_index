			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GETTING DOWN TO BASICS WITH BEATTY  </P> <P> Beatty's cogent observation in Mathews' excellent bio article is timely: ". . .  box-office grosses, film budgets and production problems demean films" and  "box-office reports are promoting bad films."  </P> <P> Clearly, the PR use of such statistics have become vulgar marketing tools.  </P> <P> When I was young, I used to root for Hugh McElhenny of the San Francisco 49ers.  My focus was on Hugh's awesome broken-field running. I didn't know his salary  or even care. Today, ask kids about basketball star Michael Jordan. They'll  fire off some stats at you, prefaced by the seven-digit figure of his enormous  salary.  </P> <P> I suspect that some movie budgets are exaggerated to hype the box office.  Whatever happened to quality for quality's sake?  </P> <P> Michael Jordan is clearly a very great athlete. And Warren Beatty is a major  talent in the entertainment world. Neither require "seven-digit hype" to sell  their quality talents.  </P> <P> The "bean counters" who dominate sports, Hollywood and our society today  ultimately demean the Jordans and the Beattys.  </P> <P> PHIL CAVAGNARO  </P> <P> San Bernardino  </P></p>

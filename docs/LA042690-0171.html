			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HARCOURT MULLS SELLING SOME ASSETS  </P> <P> Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc., which has vowed for months that none of its  assets were for sale, said Wednesday it is discussing the possible sale of a  portion of its publishing business.  </P> <P> Peter Jovanovich, president and chief executive officer, said the Orlando-based  corporation has begun preliminary discussions involving the sale of some or all  of its existing debt at a discount, or the purchase of "certain assets of the  company by a third party."  </P> <P> The statement followed a report earlier Wednesday that former U.S. Sen. Eugene  McCarthy, who has served for a decade on HBJ's board, said discussions had been  under way with Thomson Corp. of Canada for a month.  </P> <P> The report by Dow Jones News Service said McCarthy did not know whether HBJ or  Thomson made the initial overture.  </P></p>

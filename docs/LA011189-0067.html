			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOW DIPS 6.25 AFTER A DAY OF PROFIT TAKING;  </P> <P> INVESTORS DAUNTED BY INTEREST RATES, ECONOMY  </P> <P> Wall Street broke a four-day winning streak Tuesday, sliding to a modest loss  after profit taking hit the market at a key technical level.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrials closed at 2,193.21, a decline of 6.25 points.  </P> <P> Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 4 to 3 in trading of New  York Stock Exchange-listed stocks.  </P> <P> The closely watched index of 30 leading shares was up 5.17 points Monday but it  failed to close above the key level of 2,200, ending just shy at 2,199.46.  </P> <P> Stocks began the session with a bounce, led by futures-related buying, analysts  said. But when the programs turned sellers, the market was knocked off its  perch.  </P> <P> Higher short-term interest rates, unremitting strength in the U.S. economy and  futures-related selling daunted investors, analysts said.  </P> <P> "It is a bit demoralizing that the market cannot get through that level  (2,200)," said market analyst Hugh Johnson of First Albany.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sluggish Market  </P> <P> Traders said the market seemed to be catching its breath after having advanced  in every session of 1989 except the first, setting three post-crash highs in  the process.  </P> <P> There was no major economic news affecting the stock market Tuesday, although  stocks got continued support from bonds and the dollar.  </P> <P> The dollar rose in spite of reports of continued dollar-selling by the Federal  Reserve, which is trying to restrain the currency's rise. The dollar's strength  helped buoy bonds, which finished slightly higher.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, high interest rates, particularly for short-term instruments,  remain an attractive alternative to stocks.  </P> <P> The stock market was somewhat sluggish because it was still trying to digest  stocks dumped on it Monday in a big sell program coordinated by Goldman, Sachs  &amp; Co., said Philip Puccio, manager of institutional trading at Dillon, Read  &amp; Co.  </P> <P> The asset manager rumored to be behind the sale, Renaissance Investment  Management Inc. of Cincinnati, declined to comment on its involvement.  </P> <P> "We are variously accused or ascribed as having done things beyond the power of  mortal men at times," said Frank Terrizzi, the firm's president.  </P> <P> Volume on the floor of the NYSE totaled 140.42 million shares, down from 163.18  million in the previous session.  </P> <P> On the London Stock Exchange, share prices finished slightly higher Tuesday,  after an uneven day that saw sharp movements in several speculative stocks. The  Financial Times 100-share index ended with a gain of 4.5 points at 1,836.0.  </P></p>

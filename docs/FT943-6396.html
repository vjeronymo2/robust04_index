			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Bangemann in plea for private telecom funding The private sector - not the public sector  - should take the lead in funding the telecommunications networks of the future, Mr Martin Bangemann, EU industry commissioner, said yesterday. In a speech to the 13th World Computer Congress in Hamburg, Mr Bangemann said there was no need for extra public sector funding; but he warned that private companies and consortia had to be given the chance to compete on an equal footing. This meant breaking up long distance telephone monoplies, and linking existing networks as fast as possible so as to achieve the lower tariffs vital for creating the new information society. 'The only way to get lower tariffs is through competition,' he told delegates. Mr Bangemann's crusading tone comes amid presssure from Brussels to liberalise the supply of telecommunications infrastructure across the European Union, despite continued opposition from national telecoms operators fighting the loss of their monopolies. Mobile, satellite and other business-related services are already open to competition. EU governments have also agreed to set a target date of 1998 for the opening of competition in basic 'voice services' which account for most of the revenue of telcoms operators. But the question of competing infrastructure, as permitted in the UK, has been left for decision in 1995 with no prior commitment to liberalise. Mr Bangemann's speech yesterday suggests further pressure from the Commission to bring forward the decision and secure a commitment to infrastructure competition from member states. The speech comes as the European Commission is putting final touches to a new document on EU industrial policy in the 1990s. The document is likely to be measured against the strategy for industrial policy set out by Mr Bangemann in 1990. The 1990 paper abandoned 'vertical' policies in favour of channelling aid to particular sectors. Instead, it promoted 'horizontal' spending on training, infrastructure and research - the idea being to bolster competitiveness and benefit the whole European economy rather than championing individual industries. In his speech, Mr Bangemann said industrial policy should not only cover the technological industries of tomorrow. New technologies could - and should - be adapted to tackle today's problems. He cited the use of computerised traffic management systems which could regulate city traffic and introduce fairer tariffs through 'road pricing'; introduction of modern diagnostic equipment which could offer early warning systems registering air pollution and allergy levels; and use of information networks such as 'telemedicine' for cheaper, more efficient health care. Mr Bangemann called for an extension of telecom networks to pave the way for multi-media services such as teleshopping, telebanking and teleworking. 'We don't need elegance, we need practical solutions,' he said.</p>

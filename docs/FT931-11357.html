			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Test rail franchises to be set up THE main effect of yesterday's announcements on the privatisation of British Rail is that the private sector is likely to be operating most of the passenger trains between London and south-west England and all those in Scotland by the end of next year. The government's plans involve putting BR's tracks into the ownership of a new state-owned body called Railtrack and parcelling out the operation of the passenger trains to private-sector franchisees by competitive tender. To give would-be franchisees an idea of what they might be letting themselves in for, the government will set up seven pilot franchises that will be split from the rest of the railway this year and run autonomously by BR managers. These franchises will not necessarily be the first to be contracted out to the private sector, but because they will be in a better state of readiness than the rest it is assumed they will be prime candidates. The seven - with annual ticket revenue - are: Network SouthEast's south-western division operating out of London Waterloo. Turnover: Pounds 230m. InterCity's east coast main line from London King's Cross to Edinburgh and Glasgow. Turnover: Pounds 209m. InterCity's Great Western main line from Paddington to south Wales and south-west England. Turnover: Pounds 159m. ScotRail, comprising all non-InterCity lines in Scotland. Turnover: Pounds 81.6m. The London, Tilbury &amp; Southend line running into London's Fenchurch Street station. Turnover: Pounds 56m. InterCity's Gatwick Express. Turnover: Pounds 25m. The Isle of Wight railway which, unusually, will be franchised along with its tracks. Turnover: not available. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said yesterday that a complete map of proposed franchise areas covering the rest of the network would be published later this year. In an attempt to make the franchising process as simple as possible, would-be franchisees will not be involved in complex negotiations over train services and track charges. Instead, the franchising authority will work these out with Railtrack and then put the resulting deal out to tender. All that companies will be required to do is to look at the deal and say how much they are prepared to bid to run the service under the terms agreed. If they reckon it will run at a loss (as most will), they will bid according to the amount of subsidy they require.</p>

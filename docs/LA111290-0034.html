			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LUTHER CAMPBELL'S LYRICS  </P> <P> Luther Campbell self-righteously puts an "adult" sticker on the album and hides  behind his claim of comedy ("Today They're Trying to Censor Rap, Tomorrow. . .  ," Nov. 5).  </P> <P> Since when is it entertainment to tear open women's vaginas, bust the walls,  break their backbones?  </P> <P> They call this comedy? I call it rape, and rape and sexual violence aren't  funny. Ask the runner in Central Park.  </P> <P> KATHY SILVERI  </P> <P> Channel Islands Beach  </P></p>

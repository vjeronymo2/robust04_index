			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Talks begin on airways dispute The UK and US governments yesterday started a new round of talks in London to try to resolve their dispute over transatlantic air services, Paul Betts writes. The UK has already warned Washington it would limit US airline services to London's Heathrow Airport if the Washington administration sought to curtail the rights of British Airways in the US. Mr Lawrence Nagin, an executive vice-president of United Airlines, one of the big three US carriers, said that a trade war between the two countries would ultimately hit the consumer hardest because of the risk of fewer transatlantic services. The US will be pressing the UK government to grant US carriers more access into Heathrow airport. The UK is seeking an easing in US regulations on foreign ownership of US carriers.</p>

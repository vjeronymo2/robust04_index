National Transportation Safety  Board officials said a preliminary examination showed that the Boeing 747 door  had fractured longitudinally near the midspan latch. The piece was found late  Wednesday in 14,100 feet of water 90 miles south-southwest of Honolulu, said a  U.S. Pacific Fleet spokeswoman.  </P></p>

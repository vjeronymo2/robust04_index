			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Mellor to oversee lottery bill MR DAVID Mellor's national heritage department has taken over the main legislative responsibility for the National Lotteries Bill. The Home Office is expected to have residual responsibilities under gaming legislation, but Mr Mellor and his department - whose work the lottery is intended to help fund - will steer the bill through the Commons. Mr Mellor, a former chief secretary to the Treasury, believes that a national lottery could produce as much as Pounds 1bn a year to support cultural and sporting life in the UK and improve crumbling and outdated buildings such as sports stadiums. It was also announced earlier this week that Mr Mellor would take over the government's continuing interest in press standards and regulation. The government is due this summer to review the performance of the Press Complaints Commission, set up after the Calcutt Committee investigation into privacy to replace the Press Council. The Home Office is expected to retain its responsibility for issues such as data protection. Changes in departmental responsibilities involving the biggest shake-up Whitehall has experienced for many years were announced yesterday, writes Ivor Owen. They give effect to the proposals in the Conservative party's election manifesto, but no date has yet been set for the transfer of responsibility for oversight and regulation of the financial-services sector and investor protection to the Treasury. The timing of the change will be announced in a Transfer of Functions Order which is likely to be debated in the Commons. Responsibility for company investigations will remain with the Serious Fraud Office and the Department of Trade and Industry.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yerevan ("RESPUBLICA ARMENIA" (Past), "LRAGIR"  dailies), 06/21/94 -- A Mediation Delegation, headed by the CSCE  Minsk group Chairman Jan Eliasson, started its visit to the  region on June 14.    Members of the delegation arrived from Baku to Yerevan on  June 16, and met First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs  Zhirair Liparityan. The delegation left to Stepanakert on the  same date, and returned back to Yerevan on June 17 and met the  President Levon Ter-Petrosyan. On June 18, members of the  delegation met Liparityan again, and then left for Baku. On  June 19, Eliasson returned from Baku to Yerevan, and negotiated  with the Armenian authorities. He left the Armenian capital on  the same day. No other details are reported by official  Armenian press services.    According to preliminary estimates, visit of the CSCE Minsk  group Chairman Jan Eliasson to the region has finished without  notable results. Jan Eliasson said that the sides are still  keeping rather harsh stances. In addition to this, the incident  at the north- western section of the RA border on June 18 may  seriously affect further negotiations.    Chairman of the Minsk group wasn't able to find any  solutions  to oppose the Russian project. He met unexpected obstacles in  Azerbaijan to implementation of their plan of the Karabakh  conflict's resolution. According to "Lragir", Baku suggested to  involve the problem of liberating Shusha and Lachin from  Armenian forces in the CSCE project. This topic is absent in  the current version of the CSCE plan, being unacceptable to the  Armenian side.</p>

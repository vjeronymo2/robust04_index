			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE VOTES FOR PLOT TO HONOR CHINA PROTEST  </P> <P> The Senate voted Wednesday to name a grassy plot near the Chinese Embassy in  Washington "Tian An Men Square Park" in honor of pro-democracy demonstrators in  Beijing.  </P> <P> In addition to memorializing demonstrators who were killed by the Chinese army,  said the bill's sponsor, Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.), the action serves "to  remind Beijing that America will never and can never forget the ruthlessness  and callousness of the Chinese government in crushing their  citizen-demonstrators and their aspirations."  </P> <P> The proposal expresses the sense of Congress that a statue should be  constructed to honor the fallen students.  </P> <P> The amendment was added by voice vote to a bill authorizing State Department  programs for the new budget year.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Chernyshev, RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA economic </F> observer: "Timely Topics. GAZ Will Not Raise Its Hand"]    [Text] The serious passions seething in Nizhniy  Novgorod regarding the change in the procedure for privatization  of the GAZ Automotive Plant could possibly open up new chapters  in the Russian transition to the market. The collective has  protested the "anti-plant" decision of the State Committee for  Administration of State Property of the Russian Federation--to  give the state a controlling 20-percent block of shares while  the plant workers have to be satisfied with 15 percent.    Yuriy Kulemin, chairman of the trade union committee,  explains the position of the workers:    "We were simply deceived, because, according to the  previously approved privatization plan, the state structures  were to have owned only one out of 10 shares. Therefore before  the adoption of the unfortunate decision, 120,000 of our  engineers, specialists, and workers were quite satisfied with  the role of being in charge with the right to a decisive vote.  Now all of them intend to defend their constitutional right to  manage their own property. As a first step we have appealed to  the court."    It is clear that GAZ has become a desired object of  privatization for many structures that intend to divide the  single giant into parts. Now 430 modern Volgas come from the  conveyor each day instead of 280. Last year alone the production  of motor vehicles increased by 27,000. They are increasing the  output of diesel trucks, children's bicycles, washing machines,  and other industrial products and they have filled orders for  various kinds of military equipment. They have received 319  billion rubles [R] in net profit, which remains at the disposal  at the enterprise, of which R189 billion has been invested in  further development of production and the social sphere.  Including about R60 billion which has been assimilated in the  form of capital investments in modernization and reconstruction  of production and preparation for series production of the  high-class diesel 1.5-tonne GAZ-3302.    The automotive plant workers intend to transform their  "automotive state" into a joint-stock company in the form of a  powerful transnational corporation called GAZ which functions  aggressively on domestic and foreign automotive markets. And the  structure of the joint-stock portfolio, which balances the  interests of the state and the producers, has given evidence to  the birth of almost the first financial-industrial group in  Russia. Effective the middle of 1994 on its basis in Nizhniy  Novgorod there should arise a seat of stability and confident  economic growth. After all, automotive construction means dozens  of industrial enterprises, trade, transportation, service,  banks, VUZ's [higher educational institutions], science, and  many other things all bound together into a single unit.    The main guarantee of the feasibility of such plans, let us  recall, was that the association could retain the controlling  block of shares. But frequent examples of "seizure," whereby  maneuvers with the transfer of blocks of securities from state  into private hands have led to a loss of independence by large  Russian enterprises, have forced the automotive plant workers to  take defensive measures.    The Nizhniy Novgorod automotive giant organized a brilliant  and instantaneous financial operation through its subsidiary  firm GAZinvest. It organized the purchase of vouchers with money  from the privatization fund for workers and pensioners, and the  checks were turned over the GAZinvest. Waiting until, in keeping  with Russian laws, the state put up 50 percent of the plant's  shares for sale through auction, GAZinvest participated in the  auction in keeping with the interests of the workers of the  collective and the board of directors functioned smoothly as  well.    Numerous partners from Moscow, St. Petersburg, and some of  the other largest industrial centers of Russia helped the  automotive plant to hold out. Now it would be impossible to sell  out the flourishing plant no matter what happens. And this is  where it all began.    The first round of artillery fire was directed at the plant  by the State Committee for the Administration of State Property,  which issued its January decision to establish a controlling  20-percent share for the state. The governor of Nizhniy Novgorod  Oblast, Boris Nemtsov, sent the government of the Russian  Federation a letter concerning violations of existing  legislation when conducting the check auction for sale of shares  in the GAZ Joint-Stock Company. As a result there appeared a  directive from the government to declare the check auction for  the sale of shares in the GAZ Joint-Stock Company null and void.    Additionally, the government directive ordered all  stockholders to "raise their hands" when voting for removal of  the general director of the GAZ Joint-Stock Company, Boris  Vidyayev, from the position he held. As is customary in such  cases, the procuracy was given the corresponding instructions.  In brief, thunder clouds hung over the automotive plant at the  end of March.    It was almost impossible to get a call through to Vidyayev  himself. He was busy with the production: conference calls,  planning sessions, business meetings, visits to the  shops...finally the general director picked up the receiver. He  commented briefly on the situation:    "The accusations that were made are contrived and  irresponsible. Any unprejudiced audit or legal investigation  will confirm the legality of our actions, which were aimed at  preventing the plant from being bought up by unwanted masters.  The workers simply will not stand for such a turn of events.  They are the ones who are now the owners of the joint-stock  capital, which makes it possible for all of us to look  confidently to the future with the hope of the rebirth of  Russia."    Boris Vidyayev says that he anticipated such a turn of  events  and accusations of personal financial transgressions. Because he  will have to take the first blow personally. In the bookkeeping  office, in his words, everything is crystal clear and he himself  is blameless before his workers and Russia. But his enemies have  still decided to find criminal activity elsewhere. The plant,  they say, has spent money on acquiring vouchers while the  enterprise was late with its payments to the budget. Well, so  what? If the deferment was permitted, it was permitted. The  money went into the budget, but money likes to circulate. We  must judge not those for whom the ruble is working, but those  for whom it is a dead weight.    So far the Ministry of Industry of the Russian Federation  has  refused to comment on the situation, referring to the need to  fulfill government directives. One of the workers, who asked  that his name be withheld, said there were no charges against  the current leadership of the Nizhniy Novgorod automotive plant  and added that in Russia today enterprising and resourceful  directors should be rewarded and not punished. Otherwise, there  will be no rebirth.    In all probability subsequent events will take the most  unexpected turn for all parties. Only the State Committee for  Administration of State Property and the Nizhniy Novgorod  governor's office have had their say in this story. Then the  story went into the press with one-sided criminal overtones.  Until the judicial investigation is over, the workers have  sensibly decided not to raise an unnecessary fuss and to return  to the shops.    I think they share the initial goals of privatization: To  help the reborn Russia and not to destroy production that is  already prospering and not to divide it into juicy morsels to be  swallowed up by the sharks of international business.    So far nobody has heard the true voice of the collective of  120,000, the real owners. According to existing evidence the  permanent body of workers and engineers intend to defend firmly  and without compromise their right to be truly and not just  apparently in charge. So far this is the only positive result of  privatization and, possibly, new chapters in its history. When  it is the working people who are interested in the preservation,  growth, and flourishing of their property.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   P.S. After this article was already prepared for the  press we received the following report. On 25 March the High  Arbitration Court of the Russian Federation adopted an  affirmative decision regarding the complaint of the GAZ  Joint-Stock Company: "On declaring the directive of the State  Committee for Administration of State Property of the Russian  Federation of 19 January 1994, No. 121-R, to be not in keeping  with legislation and violating the rights and interests of the  GAZ Joint-Stock Company which are protected by law."    As they say, the factories--to the workers, the  land--to the peasants, and the law--to the people. On this we  stand.</p>

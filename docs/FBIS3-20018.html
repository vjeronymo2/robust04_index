Van den Broek  arrived here this evening accompanied by Serge Abou, the EU  observer on the Cyprus issue.    Speaking upon his arrival, van den Broek said the EU and  Cyprus are working together for Cyprus' EU accession. He said  the Cyprus issue is dragging on and expressed the hope that  Cyprus will be reunited. He also said that the EU's interest in  a Cyprus solution became more pointed with the appointment of an  observer to the talks. Van den Broek expressed regret that the  talks are going through a difficult phase, as he put it, and  called on the side responsible to cooperate with the Cypriot  Government and United Nations, amend its position on the  confidence-building measures, and cooperate for a political  settlement.    Welcoming the EU commissioner, Foreign Minister Alekos  Mikhailidhis expressed his deep gratitude and stressed that van  den Broek has contributed decisively to historic beginnings for  Cyprus, adding that it is hoped things will reach a successful  conclusion with Cyprus' accession to the EU. Mikhailidhis also  said that the EU commissioner's presence in Cyprus is very  important. It is, he added, a political message indicating the  importance of Cyprus' upgraded relations with the EU.

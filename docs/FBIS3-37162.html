			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 14 TASS -- Journalists are going to  continue the struggle for their economic survival, heads of  journalists' unions of Russia and Moscow, the Glasnost  Protection Fund and other organisations announced today at a  press conference of the Committee for Emergency Measures to  Protect the Press.    The immediate reason for calling the press conference was  the  situation at the TV. However, there are many other problems to  be discussed. Journalists, who are considered the fourth power  in Russia, insist that the government should keep the promises  it gave to them, specifically, the January resolution dealing  with providing support for the publication and circulation of  mass media organs.    Oleg Poptsov, head of the Russian TV company, said that by  today the government had decided to allocate to state-owned TV  companies 51 per cent of the money they need. However, the  Ministry of Finance allocated 18 per cent of what they need,  without taking into account their debt to communication services  in 1993. Poptsov regards the step taken by communication  workers as a call for a general political strike and is sure  that three days without radio and TV will be enough for the  country to get out of control.    According to Anatoliy Yezhelev, chairman of the Committee  for  Emergency Measures to Protect the Press, journalists intend to  display solidarity, defending their professional interests and  the right of citizens to information. It is quite probable that  another stoppage of TV and radio broadcasting will be followed  by a call for the information boycott of the government's work.    Measures, suggested to the government by the Federal  Committee for the Press, may change radically the economic  situation of the press. According to chairman of the committee  Boris Mironov, these include tax privileges, the granting of  easy-term credits, the exemption from customs duties of the  imported printing equipment and paper, etc. Vsevolod Bogdanov,  chairman of the Russian Journalists' Union, believes that the  state should take upon itself the legal protection of  journalists and guarantee their access to information.    Heads of journalists' unions are going to insist on the  keeping of promises. Editors-in-chief will have a meeting  tonight with press secretary of the president Vyacheslav  Kostikov, where they will discuss problems of journalists,  Bogdanov told ITAR-TASS.</p>

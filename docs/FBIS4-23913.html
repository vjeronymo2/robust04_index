			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town -- ANC proposals to institute race  monitors to ensure "affirmative action" in the public sector  would result in anti-White discrimination, and increased  emigration of the country's skilled personnel, the Freedom Front  [FF] said yesterday. Mr Joseph Chiole, Freedom Front spokesman  on state administration, said elements of the ANC's affirmative  action proposals "spell serious danger that the greatest racial  discrimination in South Africa's history -- against Whites -- is  now being planned".    This was indicated by the fact that the recommendations of  the Public Service Commission on the filling of vacant posts,  including recommendations made after merit determination, had  been withdrawn. This had to be seen against the fact that the  government proposed to institute race monitors to ensure that  affirmative action took place, not only in the civil service but  also in the private sector.    "The fact that in some instances undertakings will have to  keep records of the race of their employees as well as their  clients will increase the level of racial tension in South  Africa. It would also increase bureaucratic red tape, which  could have serious financial repercussions for businesses."    Referring to the statement last week by Public Service and  Administration Minister Mr Zola Skweyiya that "monitoring  mechanisms" would watch developments in every department of  state, Mr Chiole said that, in simple terminology, this meant  preferential treatment for blacks. The implication was that  appointments would not necessarily be made on the basis of  merit, and that qualified Whites faced blatant racial  discrimination.</p>

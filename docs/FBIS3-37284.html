In his words, the visit will become "a real  realization of the words of the American president that if 1993  was the year of Russia, 1994 will become the year of Ukraine".    Buteyko pointed out that during the visit "the Ukrainian  president hopes to confirm the development of cooperation",  paying special attention to "the transformation of political  agreements into economic ones". He said that the Charter on  principles of relations between Ukraine and the U.S. will be  adopted in Washington.    Besides, Buteyko said that documents on the development of  economic ties and trade, cooperation in the space field and aid  for conversion of the Ukrainian military complex, as well as on  humanitarian and financial aid, had been prepared for the  signing. Treaties on mutual protection of investment and  prevention of dual taxation have also been prepared for the  signing.    In Buteyko's opinion, "the American administration is  finishing the re-evaluation of its attitude to Ukraine".</p>

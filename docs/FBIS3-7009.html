			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 24 March Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] In connection with the U.S. Government's demand for  compensation from Japanese construction companies for alleged  "dango" [bid-rigging] on construction work at the U.S. Atsugi  Naval Station, a majority of the general contractors and civil  engineering firms involved have decided to reject the demand,  claiming: "This issue has been resolved; we do not intend to  meet the demand" (according to Nishimatsu Construction Company,  Ltd.). These companies will send a letter to the law firm  representing the U.S. Government before 25 March, the deadline  set by the United States for a reply, and inform it of their  rejection. Since the Japanese parties have come out clearly  with the intention of contesting the claim, there is now a  strong possibility that the U.S. Government will file a lawsuit.    Nishimatsu, a second-tier general contractor, denied there  was any inflation of contract fees through bid-rigging as  claimed by the United States. It stated with confidence: "The  profit (from the Atsugi Base construction work) was a few  percent. We are still undecided about whether or not to respond  to the lawsuit [sosho ni ojiru ka do ka], but if we compile the  available data at that time to argue our case, we will surely  win." Penta-Ocean Construction Company, Ltd., also said: "We  will just state in a brief letter that we say `no.'" Maeda  Corporation, which currently holds chairmanship of the Japan  Federation of Construction Contractors, says "we cannot meet the  demand." It will send out the letter of rejection on 24 March.</p>

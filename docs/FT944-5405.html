			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (9): Free of the old routine? Not quite - Home-working Homework was what teachers expected you to devote your evenings to, and the reason why parents implored you to switch off Top of The Pops. But homeworking may be altogether more palatable. It means earning your living from home, with flexibility over working hours, no commuting and freedom from memos, meetings and office politics. Many homeworkers will be self-employed. Others will be employees, also known as teleworkers, wired up through computers and fax machines to the companies they work for. Working from home has many attractions, but take care of all financial aspects. Advice is available from books, banks and professional or trade bodies. Here we touch on some of the common pitfalls. Insurance: Inform the company that insures your home and contents that you are working from home. It might require you to install extra security devices. There may also be a problem getting cover for business equipment, such as computers. You could be asked to pay an extra premium, or may need to go to a broker to buy a specialist policy. Likewise, tell your insurer if you are using your car for work. Replacing an employer's benefits: Sick pay, life insurance and pension schemes are a part of a typical employment package. If you are a self-employed homeworker, consider taking out permanent health insurance, which pays out when you are too ill to work. Private medical insurance, to pay for hospital bills, is also an option. If a health problem hinders your ability to work, long NHS waiting lists could damage the long-term viability of your business. Adequate life insurance is important for anyone with dependants. And a personal pension plan is an essential part of the financial planning armoury, not least because the self-employed do not belong to the state-run Serps pension scheme. You normally need to make sizeable contributions to achieve a decent pension. Tax: If you are an employee working from home, you could incur a tax liability on equipment supplied by your employer if you ever use it for private purposes. But if you are self-employed you can claim capital allowances for equipment that you buy. Employees can claim some expenses, including a proportion of heating, lighting and phone bills against income tax if it is a condition of their employment that they work from home. The self-employed may be able to claim many more expenses. Good record-keeping is important, and investing in the services of an accountant could pay for itself, if only for the first year or two until you are confident enough to sort out tax (and National Insurance) yourself. Vat: You may have to register and pay value-added tax if your turnover exceeds Pounds 46,000 a year. And it is sometimes worth registering for Vat on lower turnovers, if the amount of Vat on goods and services you buy exceeds what you would pay. Capital gains tax: If you use part of your home exclusively for work, you could lose a proportion of the CGT exemption on your main home. Check with your tax office.</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Markets: Hanson ends its brief freeze - The Bottom Line Hanson's great dividend freeze has proved just a cold snap. In December, the Anglo-American conglomerate failed to increase its quarterly dividend for the first time in 30 years. Last week came the thaw. The return to dividend growth is an important signal of the company's confidence in the future. Yet, on the surface, it is not obvious that the world has changed that dramatically in the past six months. Analysts estimate that this year's increased dividend payments will be covered little more than 1.2 times by underlying earnings, barely more than last year and scarcely comfortable. But the recovery in the US economy, which provides 60 per cent of Hanson's profits, is starting to show through in the group's figures. The scope for recovery in Hanson's earnings is considerable. Although it has a steady flow of profits from Imperial Tobacco, Hanson has some very cyclical businesses in areas such as building materials and chemicals which have been hit hard in the recession. It estimates that underlying profits, which are running at about Pounds 1bn a year, are around Pounds 1bn below the peak level represented by the previous records in each division. For some businesses, such as bricks in the UK, it might be argued that the peak was an unrepeatable consequence of the boom of the late 1980s. But most of the cyclical businesses are in the US where the peaks were achieved in less exceptional circumstances. A large part of the shortfall stems from Quantum Chemical, the US polyethylene and propane group acquired last September for Pounds 2bn. Quantum's profits were severely depressed by price erosion during the recession. It is large enough to make a significant difference to a group Hanson's size if it makes a decent recovery and recent evidence suggests that such a recovery is under way. Quantum is already performing better than Hanson expected and, more importantly, recent price rises are sticking. Meanwhile, the expensive strike at Peabody, Hanson's US coal business, has been settled on terms which will lead to useful cost savings and the high borrowings which were left after the Quantum acquisition,are being whittled away, largely by disposals such as the flotation of Beazer Homes. After the acquisition Hanson's gearing rose to 86 per cent, but this was down to 69 per cent by the end of March. Excluding exceptional items such as the cost of the coal strike, the company says there was a cash inflow from operations of Pounds 100m in the first half. Derek Bonham, chief executive, is so confident that the debt reduction will continue at a brisk pace that he last week said: 'We're prepared to look at acquisitions from here on.' Yet, while the group's borrowings are coming down, its interest bill is rising steeply. This paradox stems from the reduction in the disparity between US and UK interest rates which allowed Hanson to make more money on cash deposited in the UK than it paid in interest on its much larger debt in the US. As a result, it is expecting to face an interest bill of Pounds 250m this year, compared with income of Pounds 14m last time. In terms of reported profits this will be offset by gains on disposals this year but it will absorb a good part of the recovery next year. On an underlying basis, analysts expect profits to edge up to just over Pounds 1bn this year rising to Pounds 1.35 in the year to September 1995. Assuming that Hanson manages to hold its tax rate to the underlying level of 28 per cent achieved this year earnings would rise to around 18p in 1994-95. That would only cover this year's likely dividends of 11.85p just over one and a half times. Given the cyclical nature of the businesses, and the longer- term threats to Imperial Tobacco's profits, Hanson's prudent approach would require cover to be built up significantly further, limiting the scope for dividend increases. But with the shares yielding over 5.5 per cent gross income-seeking investors can afford to be patient.</p>

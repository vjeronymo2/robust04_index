			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Kenneth Gooding report: "Alumina Terminal Opened on </F> Russia's East Coast"]    [Text] An Anglo-Russian project to open up one of the  bottlenecks that has restricted the import of an essential raw  material for the Russian aluminium industry became operational  this week when 25,600 tonnes of alumina (aluminium oxide) was  unloaded by new facilities at the east coast port of Vanino.    The bulk alumina handling facilities, costing "several  million dollars," are jointly owned by by Trans-World Metals,  the UK-based trading group, and the Vanino Port Authority, one  of the new Russian joint stock companies.    Russia has only one other such handling facility, at  Murmansk. According to Mr Alan Bekhor, managing director of  Trans-World, said to be the biggest trader in Russian aluminium:  "The Vanino facilities open the way for alumina to get to  Russia more efficiently. They represent a logical link between  Australia, the world's biggest alumina producer, and Russia's  big Siberian smelters." The first alumina through the  facilities was bought from Alcoa of Australia.    Mr Bekhor said that within three months a second stage would  lift the bulk alumina handling capacity at Vanino to 50,000  tonnes a month. The port is at one end of the Baykal-Amur  railway which runs parallel to the Trans-Siberian railway.    In theory the facilities are available to all but  "TransWorld  will probably keep them busy for the rest of this year."  However, Mr Bekhor stressed: "This is a long-term investment  and there will be no quick returns."</p>

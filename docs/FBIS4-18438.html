			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Semih Idiz from the "Public Eye" column: "What </F> the Welfare Party Victory Tells Us"]    [Text] What now? This is the question being asked by the  large number of Turks who did not cast their ballots for the  pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) that more or less doubled its  support in Sunday's local elections gaining 18 percent of the  overall vote.    The fear is that the important gains by the Islamites will  in  a short time translate into interference in the secular way of  life that the majority of people in this country are used to.  As they consolidate their foothold the Islamites will then turn  to dismantling the principles of Kemalizm one by one, starting  with laicism, this fear has it.    As for their final goal, it is believed this will be the  institution of the Shari'ah, the all-encapsulating Islamic  judicial code governing everything from a husband and wives  behaviour in bed to the conduct of international relations.  There can be no doubt that there are elements within the RP who  would be more than delighted to see all of this come about.  Even statements by the RP leader Necmettin Erbakan can be  interpreted as pointing to the fact that he too would wish such  an outcome eventually.    It is however equally evident that the RP will not want to  endanger its victory on Sunday from day one. This is a cool and  calculating party that has worked hard both at the top and at  the bottom to get the outcome it has gotten.    It mobilized tens of thousands of young men and women in a  door to door campaign which highlighted concrete rather than  "spiritual" issues.    In its campaign the RP capitalized to the full the anger  among the public resulting from the incompetence and corruption  of current local administrators.    It promised to bring concrete solution to concrete problems  ranging from air pollution to the environment, from the price of  bread to city transportation.    The first statements by victorious RP candidates show that  these are the issues they will concentrate on initially. In  order to allay a major fear among the public they have even  indicated that they will not revoke alcohol licences--considered  the litmus test for RP--that have already been issued, although  they admit they will not issue new ones. All this indicates  that this Party has no intention of scaring away timid people  whose support it has gained for social reasons and whose votes  have been effective in the RP victory. Especially when it will  want to consolidate its position prior to the general elections  in the fall of 1996.    This is why we are hearing a lot of: "don't be afraid we are  not as bad as the opposition says we are" type of statements  emanating from new RP mayors.    It must also be remembered of course, that the RP also  tapped  the anger of a predominantly conservative society in the face of  images of unchecked hedonism by a rich minority.    An anti-aesthetic minority whose ugly Bacchanalian and  corrupt antics were persistently presented in the mass media as  if it was representative and the sign of social advancement.  [sentence as published] In this respect it is wrong to say  that spiritual and moral considerations did not play any role in  these elections and in the RP victory.    On the other hand, the images, highlighting the behavior of  this ill-educated newly rich segment of society, churned out day  in day out by the press and private televisions were a main  instrument contributing to the conservative backlash. The fact  is that the press and television in Turkey have contributed  hardly anything to cultural and educational awareness choosing  instead to go down the path of least resistance by exploiting  basic instincts.    This press and television however is now in a state of near  panic because "the Islamites are coming."    The media in Turkey refuses to see that it has come to  represent the cultural, moral and ethical decay that  conservative elements have objected to so strongly. It has also  come to represent for intellectuals the "anti-culture" of a  decaying new rich bourgeoisie which abused its social privileges  to the hilt.    Regardless of where they stand politically the  establishment parties, including those on the left, also  pandered to the whims of this new rich element and its press and  media, thinking somehow that this would enhance their power.    On top of all this where they could they also took their  "pick of the readies" [money] that an increasing corrupt system  was laying on their path.    This is what makes it conceivable today that people who  generally voted for social democrats have now turned to the RP  because of its social messages even though it is a religious  based party.    Especially when the RP intentionally kept its social message  in the foreground and its spiritual message in the background --  except, of course, where it needed this message to fortify its  social message.    The main thing now is to try and interpret what is going on  in a cool and calm manner. There is no need to panic. Neither  is there a need to be complacent about anything. There is  however a need to try and see things for what they really are.  The first thing to realize is that Turkey is a complex country  that does not lend itself to easy answers. Even if no one else  is aware of this one can be sure that the RP is.... [ellipsis as  published]    Mark the taxi driver who drove me to work this morning. He  said he was a staunch supporter of the ultranationalist  Nationalist Movement Party (MHP).    "I would never vote for the RP" he said "But I voted for  Melih Gokcek (the RP's candidate for Ankara)."    He said he did not see this as a vote for the RP in the  sense  that he had opted for the candidate that had convinced him the  most during the campaign about addressing Ankara's growing  problems.    This is just one permutation. There must be thousands more,  especially among those who switched from a social democratic  vote to the RP. The RP is more than aware of this.    It is important now to note the warning the public has given  the mainstream parties who have much time to mend their ways, to  overcome their petty bickering and to serve the people for a  change rather than serving themselves.    This is the only way to allay the "Islamic threat." But more  than issuing a warning the RP victory has also signalled the  unmistakable advent on the political scene of a new force in  Turkish society which will have to be considered from now on.    The RP victory will inevitably catalyze a new social  contract  in this country whose ethnic, religious, and sectarian divisions  are becoming more apparent as time goes on.    The social contract will have to of necessity be based on  democratic ideals in order for all to have their breathing space.    It will have to prove to all the parties to it that  maintaining the whole is to the advantage of all of them  individually.    This is the challenge facing the country and its  legislators.  Shallow commentators in the Turkish media who have contributed  nothing to enhancing the awareness of the public, and who are  now panic stricken because their "cushy life styles" appear to  be threatened are not aware of this.    Their complacency did not permit them to see what was on the  horizon and now they are screaming for help. But there is no  succor for them.    Perhaps they will now see that the basis of a new social  balance of power is being laid in Turkey and act accordingly.  Hopefully this will also lead them to exercising some  intelligence to ensure that the overall democratic system is  strengthened in a manner that prevents it from becoming the tool  of one segment of society or another.</p>

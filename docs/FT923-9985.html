			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Arts: Fast forward to the end of the world - Video A DARK thought occurred to me at the Irn-Bru Pop Video Exhibition, which has just opened at London's Museum of the Moving Image. Is the world seeing its whole cultural history flash before it, processed into these bite-size hallucinations, much as a drowning person is treated to a short, dramatic 'pop video' of his past life? Many of us today are worried by the fact that the planet Earth is about to open its mouth to its doctor and say '1999,' possibly followed by 'Aaargh.' Pre-millennial tension is a natural human condition. The rise of the pop video is part of it: symbolic of a shortening of the spiritual breath before the numbers change to 2000. The MOMI exhibition will show you what I mean. A dozen screens glower in darkened corners, issuing crazed staccato images of life and death, sex and smoke, Madonna and Michael Jackon. Nor is this walpurgisnacht screen culture confined to the pop video. The month's new feature film releases on video show that we have entered an age not so much of the short attention span as of the hunger for audio-visual tyranny. Batman (Warners) is now available to pushbutton viewers, timed to coincide with Batman Returns at the cinemas. Both are drowning-person movies par excellence. Never mind leisurely exposition or patient filling-in of character: the screen explodes with cackling guest stars, runaway production design and multi-megaton special effects. The video version of Batman is on widescreen format - hurrah] - which at least makes the strident virtuosity more bearable. Your eyes can roam a little around the mayhem. For another facet of the pre-millennial moving image is that we are mostly told what to see, perhaps on the principle that drowning people have no say in what flashes before them. This tendency is evident in films as diverse as this month's My Girl (Columbia), The Butcher's Wife (CIC) and Dead Again (CIC). Made for the large screen, they play as if made for the small. We are hustled through the plots with heads held still while the cast stand at stage-front enacting their one-dimensional dramas of sentimental growing pain (My Girl), clairvoyant whimsy (The Butcher's Wife) or amnesiac murder mystery (Dead Again). In former movie eras, before films had to anticipate a second life on television, the screen image could be a fresco. The eye could wander around a John Ford landscape or an Orson Welles cityscape, foraging for details. Today, the threat of emptying cinemas and homes equipped with fast-forward buttons puts pressure on film-makers to hold the viewer's attention at all costs, if necessary in a vice. Let me illustrate the negative effect of this by citing one positive moment in The Butcher's Wife. The scene caused incredulous joy at the press show I attended. While psychiatrist Jeff Daniels and another character discuss an important plot point in a foreground doorway, Daniels's unoccupied patient in the background performs some quiet, inventively eccentric funny business with a mask. The shock of being allowed to take in two zones of action at once in a modern Hollywood movie made everyone in the audience guffaw with nervous delight. But drowning persons are allowed few such moments of questing contemplation. For these you must turn from modern Hollywood to the art film sector of the video market, now growing fast enough to offer a serious home-viewing alternative. August's treats include Robert Bresson's L'Argent (Artificial Eye), a majestically gnomic murder tale from the director of Pickpocket, the Tavianis' harshly powerful Padre Padrone (Artificial Eye) and from Australia Jane Campion's Sweetie (Electric). This last is a tale of family and personal breakdown couched at times in the language of non-sequiturs and surrealism we associate with pop videos. But there is a human story, and there are slower passages between the scherzos in which we can think about that story. That is the difference - a rapidly disappearing one in our countdown culture - between viewing images and drowning in them.</p>

			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / International Company News: Viag gets a Bavarian ring-fence  -Germany's biggest privatisation to date Anyone who still believes Germany's revived enthusiasm for privatisation will open the way for participation in key sectors by outsiders needs look no further than this week's sale of Bavaria's state-owned electricity utility to Viag to confirm that this is hardly the case. In a deal described as Germany's biggest privatisation to date, Viag agreed to take full control of Bayernwerk and all its appendages, including a 24.9 per cent stake in Viag. In return, the Bavarian government is to walk away with a thumping DM2.3bn (Dollars 1.3bn) in cash plus a minority blocking stake of 25.1 per cent in the enlarged Viag group. Just to be on the safe side, the ring-fence around Viag is reinforced by hefty stakes in the safe custody of other Bavarian institutions. Local banks, led by the Bayerische Vereinsbank have 15 per cent and Mr August von Finck, of the famous local banking family, has 13.5 per cent. Announcing the deal on Thursday, Mr Edmund Stoiber, Bavarian prime minister, solemnly underscored his commitment to privatisation local-style with a promise that the 25.1 per cent in the enlarged Viag (which is to move its headquarters from Bonn to Munich) would be sold within the next five years. It would go, he said, to a 'sensible' circle of shareholders - in the interests of securing a 'solid energy policy for Bavaria'. Viag executives, keen to promote the group as an international business (30 per cent of the stock is held by non-German investors) declared themselves comfortable with a loyal local band around them. It offered 'protection against raiders' while they got on with the job of restructuring. 'Raiders' was also a notional threat which worried Mr Werner Lamby, former chairman. But that was back in 1989, one year after the Bonn government sold its last 60 per cent stake in Viag. At that time the group's rapid-fire acquisitions were attracting favourable attention, while rumours of a looming break-up bid were exciting speculative share buyers. Viag's shares had consistently out-performed the stock market since the first stage of privatisation in 1986, and were to continue to do so until late 1991. That was when markets decided the buying spree and diversification had gone far enough and it was time for a little consolidation. Now, involved in nine disparate industrial divisions - energy, aluminium, transport, trading, packaging, paper, refractory products, chemicals and a fledgling corporate communications business - Viag suggests it is ready to put a little more capital investment behind its helpful if rather hesitant progress so far. In the recent past the VAW aluminium business has benefited from investments to increase output of packaging materials. A new plant to supply engine blocks for Ford reflects a potential-oriented policy move towards the motor vehicle industry. But VAW still runs Germany's largest aluminium smelter, even though production costs are a third higher than in other industrialised countries. Mr Georg Obermeier, finance director, who two years ago spoke of 'dressing the VAW bride' in preparation for a part-flotation, accepts that a primary source of the metal is not an essential adjunct to a successful aluminium processor. The SKW Trostberg chemicals business has been largely purged of loss-making operations, but it has still not found the partner or partners required to give it critical mass in its most promising business supplying the construction industry. According to Mr Obermeier, negotiations to take a body-building stake in the Goldschmidt group are well-advanced, and 'promising' talks are under way on at least two other fronts. Paper production is a 'not-so-core' business, he says. The same goes for Didier-Werke, the refractory products specialist, which has suffered from contraction and fading investment among some of its principal customers in the steel industry. Unveiling the new-look Viag at a press conference on Thursday, Mr Obermeier and his colleagues strove purposely to present a picture of newly-dynamised group poised for a renewed surge of growth. The company would not shy away from disinvestment or finding new homes for some businesses, declared Mr Jochen Holzer, supervisory board chairman. Mr Obermeier promised strong future growth and an early return to a progressive dividend policy. The Frankfurt stock market, unable to rush to judgment on Thursday, when Viag shares were suspended for the announcement of the terms of the Bayernwerk deal, delivered it the following day, marking Viag shares down more than 6 per cent to DM458.50.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg June 13 SAPA -- A rise in inflation  would negate the success of the new government's Reconstruction  and Development Programme [RDP], Deputy Finance Minister Alec  Erwin warned Monday [13 June]. "Its (the RDP) effect will be  retarded if inflation erodes the real income earned in newly  created jobs or micro and small enterprises, areas which are  most vulnerable to inflation," he said.    Consequently, President Nelson Mandela and the cabinet were  "unquestionably" committed to ongoing monetary and fiscal  discipline. "We all agree that we need reconstruction... but,  in government we accept that we cannot spend our way to these  objectives," he told the opening of the new headquarters of the  International Bank of Southern Africa in Johannesburg.    A ballooning fiscal deficit would likely increase  inflationary pressures and thus would also harm the ability of  South Africa's industries to restructure in a highly competitive  global environment. "It (industry restructuring) will not  succeed if domestic prices rise more rapidly than international  prices," he said.    Mr Erwin said a comprehensive and precise white paper on the  RDP was being prepared for tabling in Parliament, which would  include proposals on the RDP fund.    Government would Allocate R2.5-billion [rand] in the  upcoming  budget to the fund, and it could be supplemented by  international grant aid and private sector assistance. The  state's committment would be derived from departmental savings  and re-allocations in the budget to be presented on June 22.    "These funds will go back through government line  departments  at national, provincial and local level to kickstart the  reordering of priorities in the areas indentified in the  president's state of the nation address," Mr Erwin said.    The government also intended to augment domestic savings  with  foreign capital resources once the preparations for a  comprehensive RDP had been completed.    The government is awaiting an international credit rating  assessment before approaching global capital markets to raise  financing.    "(In addition), there is likely to be a considerable  increase  in demand for corporate, trade and structured financing and we  welcome the role that international bank and the three major  European banking houses it represents will play in this regard,"  he said.    Germany's Dresdner Bank AG, France's Banque Nationale de  Paris and Belgium's Banque Bruxelles Lambert are the three  shareholders in the Johannesburg-based international bank.    The opening of the bank's new premises was attended by  senior  executives from all three financial institutions.    "We hope to play a role in facilitating SA's re-entry into  the global financial community, working alongside established  local banks," Dresdner Bank AG international head Volker  Burghagen told reporters earlier.    "Sa needs international investment and we hope to be a link  in the chain that brings it... We are also ready to serve  leading SA companies in their domestic markets and as they take  advantage of new international opportunities."</p>

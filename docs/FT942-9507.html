			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Athens curbs on capital movement lifted early The Greek drachma could face more pressure today, following the government's unexpected decision at the weekend to lift all remaining restrictions on short-term capital movement, six weeks ahead of the July 1 deadline. Mr Yannos Papantoniou, the economy minister, said the decision to speed full liberalisation was taken 'to rebut speculators' expectations and unfounded rumours' of a devaluation in the run-up to the deadline. Economists described the move, which brings Greece into line with European Union rules on free movement of capital, as a bold attempt to pre-empt speculative attacks on the currency as the date for lifting curbs approached. However, they pointed out that there was now little likelihood of a drop in interest rates. The government aims to buttress the drachma this week by launching a new issue of Ecu and dollar-linked drachma bonds, which are popular with both domestic and foreign investors, at interest rates of 7.5 and 7.7 per cent respectively. The Bank of Greece spent almost Dollars 1bn, equivalent to about 9 per cent of the country's foreign exchange reserves, to support the drachma following the D-Mark's strong rise last week. The Greek currency fell from Dr147.2 to Dr148.1 against the D-Mark last week. On Friday, the interbank three-month rate jumped above 25 per cent, from 19 per cent at the start of the week. However, central bank officials dismissed the prospect of a massive outflow of capital with the disappearance of curbs that prevented Greeks from holding bank accounts or making short-term investments abroad. There is greater concern about the effects on the Greek currency of lifting the ban on short-term borrowing in drachmas by international investors. However, the bank still appears committed to its 'hard drachma' policy under which the Greek currency will be allowed to slide by only 7 per cent this year against other EU currencies.</p>

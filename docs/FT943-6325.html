			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Flotations at issue The surge in London share prices over the past two weeks has reinforced expectations of a flood of equity issues after the summer lull. Flotations scheduled for the autumn will be joined by several that were pulled when the market faltered in the late spring. The rights issue flow will also restart, prompting concerns that the market may suffer another bout of indigestion. This looks alarmist. Institutional cash flows are healthy and while the memory of this year's flops will make buyers more wary there is no reason to suppose that solid, well-priced issues will have any trouble. It is the international scene that is more difficult to judge. There is a queue of multi-billion dollar privatisation issues in Europe and Asia, including Lufthansa in Germany, Renault or AGF in France, Repsol in Spain, Enel or Stet in Italy, Nordbanken in Sweden and possibly the Greek telephone company OTE. The flotation of the Indian telecommunications group VSNL may also be revived if it can fight its way through a crowd of other new issues. Unless some are brought forward to take advantage of the current firm markets the programme looks no heavier than earlier in the year. But one of the props for recent issues, the wall of American money, may be weakening. The hedge funds in particular, which had been big buyers, can no longer be relied on. Governments, eager to balance their budgets by selling off state assets, may have to work harder to attract domestic funds.</p>

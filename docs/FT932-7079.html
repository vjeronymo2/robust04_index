The meeting, convened by Sweden's Finance Minister Anne Wibble, in her capacity as chair of the bank's board of governors, was held at the UK Treasury. Coopers &amp; Lybrand have been called in by the bank's internal audit committee to help it investigate the cost of the headquarters' project. 'We are sure that Coopers will do a good and thorough job of this,' said one official who had attended the meeting. He added: 'There is a firm desire to get to the bottom of the affair and there is a very firm aim to get the report completed by July 15.' The meeting was described as low key and was intended as an informative session for the finance officials of the leading industrial nations.

			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD PROFILE: NORTH CENTRAL ANAHEIM: FOCUS;  </P> <P> AN AFFORDABLE DISTRICT FOR RAISING A FAMILY  </P> <P> There are a lot of unfortunate stereotypes that can be applied to a  neighborhood whose per-capita income is $9,000 yearly: peeling paint, cars  parked on lawns, weed-ridden yards and frustrated social and personal  commentary documented in spray paint on walls, to name a few.  </P> <P> However, this Anaheim neighborhood's assets lie not in its Dun &amp; Bradstreet  but in its sense of community.  </P> <P> "It's not the kind of neighborhood where we are always running in and out of  each other's back door," says resident Lucille Gray, 32, "but we visit when  we're out doing yard work -- we know who's who, and we watch out for each  other."  </P> <P> And they do. Neighborhood Watch signs are planted every few blocks, warning  intruders to beware. Youngsters are rarely seen alone and are almost always  accompanied by mom, dad, an older brother or sister, or in small, safe groups  with their peers.  </P> <P> Western Medical Center lends aid to its neighbors with blood pressure, glucose  and cholesterol screenings, as well as at-cost mammograms, tours and community  lectures.  </P> <P> Even Uncle Sam watches out for the neighborhood. Because of the large number of  low- to moderate-income residents, the Department of Housing and Urban  Development has designated the district a target area and has made money  available for neighborhood improvements through the Community Development Block  Grant (CDBG) program.  </P> <P> According to Linda Ureno, community development coordinator for the city of  Anaheim, which administers the program, the neighborhood received $308,500 this  year and has been allocated $320,000 by HUD for the coming fiscal year.  </P> <P> "The neat thing about the whole CDBG program is that it is  grass-roots-dominated," Ureno says. "Citizens identify projects and follow them  all the way through. We have an extensive citizen-participation program that  calls for the formation of neighborhood councils," in this case the Citron  Neighborhood Council.  </P> <P> Michele Botich, chairwoman of the neighborhood council, says it holds regular  meetings for residents to put together wish lists. This enables the Anaheim  City Council to get requests for street lights, storm drains and new sidewalks  and move on them without modification or delay. Upcoming ventures include an  alley revitalization in which inoperative vehicles will be removed, potholes  will be repaired, graffiti will be removed and an entire alley spruced up.  </P> <P> "This is such a good program," she says. "But we need more people from this  particular neighborhood to attend meetings. We've got a big push on now, with  flyers and mailing lists to get as many (people) as possible to our June 7  meeting. If they have a pet project that would benefit the neighborhood, they  need to bring it to the meeting."  </P> <P> One such project is a bookmobile. "It is difficult to break the poverty cycle  unless you learn to read and do well in school," Ureno says. "When the  neighborhood asked for money for the bookmobile, CDBG gave $30,000 for  bilingual materials, new books, cellular phones -- whatever they needed to make  their life easier and reach those pockets (of people) that might not otherwise  get to the library."  </P> <P> The bookmobile program was such a rousing success that last summer more than  500 neighborhood children participated in the summer reading program.  </P> <P> Through the block grant program, qualified residents can get low-interest loans  for home improvements -- new roofing, landscaping, tree removal, paint, room  additions -- or rebates if the improvements have already been made and can be  documented.  </P> <P> Those development programs may be one of the reasons homes look so well kept.  It is a familiar sight on any given block to see lawns in transition, hazardous  trees being removed, new roofs being installed or homes being given a fresh  coat of paint.  </P> <P> Still, another reason homes are so well maintained is simple pride of  ownership. Homes such as that of Lucille and William Gray are a good example.  Brightly colored flowers frame impeccably manicured shrubs and lawns. But for  the moment, the Grays' lawn is completely brown -- they killed it so the family  could put in a new, drought-resistant yard.  </P> <P> "People keep pride in their homes," Lucille Gray says. "We're not fancy, but we  try to keep it up. We're typical. A lot of us are older and retired, but we've  stayed. A few have lost spouses but still live here."  </P> <P> But three blocks over is Juan Garcia. He and his family rent a modest home in  the neighborhood and are relative newcomers. They are part of the growing  dichotomy between older, retired, established residents and younger families  with young children looking to buy that first home. Garcia was attracted by the  prospect of an affordable, comfortable, safe place to raise a family.  </P> <P> "We moved here from Santa Ana five years ago," Garcia says with a smile, as his  three small children tackle him in the front yard of their home. "We like it.  This is a nice neighborhood."  </P> <P> Population  </P> <P> Total: (1989 est.) 6,103  </P> <P> 1980-89 change: +11.6%  </P> <P> Median Age: 25.8  </P> <P> Racial/ethnic mix:  </P> <P> White (non-Latino): 44%  </P> <P> Latino: 51%  </P> <P> Black: 1%  </P> <P> Other: 4%  </P> <P> By sex and age:  </P> <P> MALES  </P> <P> Median age: 25.7 years  </P> <P> FEMALES  </P> <P> Median age: 26.0 years  </P> <P> Income  </P> <P> Per capita: $8,946  </P> <P> Median household: $20,600  </P> <P> Average household: $22,832  </P> <P> Income Distribution:  </P> <P> Less than $25,000: 62%  </P> <P> $25,000-49,999: 33%  </P> <P> $50,000-74,999: 4%  </P> <P> $75,000-$99,999: 1%DALLAS M.

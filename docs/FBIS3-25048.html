Addressing students at Bloemfontein's Vista University on  Friday, Mr Lekota said his organisation was aware of the  rightwing's bombing campaign against the ANC, which had already  damaged offices in Parys, Bothaville, Harrismith and other areas.    Referring to "civil war preachings" by elements in the  Freedom Alliance, he said: "Let me warn them. Our peace gospel  should not be taken for cowardice or inability to take on  anybody if there is need to fight. We are given today to solve  the problems of this country peacefully, so let's not waste that  chance, for it may not come again," said Mr Lekota.</p>

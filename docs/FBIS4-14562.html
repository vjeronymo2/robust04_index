			<p>BFN     [Text] In the past three months the government has not done  anything that could be described as reform. However, during  this time nothing bad was done, apart from the imposition of  customs duties. This was stated today by former Finance  Minister Boris Fedorov.    Fedorov does not intend to join the opposition to the  government and will act in support of the submitted draft  budget, he stated at press conference.    Asked about his attitude to the idea of Kazakhstani  President  Nazarbayev about the creation of a Euro-Asian Union with a  single currency, Fedorov said that he supports that kind of  proposal if the integration will be of the Western Europe type  where a supranational currency, the ECU, is current together  with national currencies.</p>

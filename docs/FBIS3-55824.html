Zhirinovskiy's godfathers are Gaydar, the International  Monetary Fund, and monetarists of the Geoffrey Sachs type."  This view was expressed in an interview with Interfax by the  Director of the Institute for U.S. and Canadian Studies, Dr.  Georgiy Arbatov.    According to Arbatov, he fears that during his visit to  Moscow U.S. President Bill Clinton may fail to realize the need  for "great changes in Russia's economic and social policy that  could lead the country toward stabilization." Such changes  alone are capable of turning Russia into a "normal country  posing no threat to the rest of the world," Arbatov said.    According to him, stability in Russia did not increase after  December's parliamentary elections. On the whole, he said, the  "shock therapy" hit science, culture, education and health  service most of all. "A horrible de-intellectualization of  society" is in evidence. "Gaydar-style reforms are a road to  the third world. Many people, and not only in this country,  began to realize this after the success scored by Zhirinovskiy,"  Arbatov declared.    He believes that "Russia must rely primarily on its own  strength." "As a matter of fact, the Americans have never given  us tangible material aid, but they did us a disservice by  recommending Gaydar-style reforms - the 'shock therapy'. The  greatest aid they can give us is to stop giving bad advice," Dr.  Arbatov said.    Arbatov said he hopes that after his visit to Moscow the  U.S.  president will acquire "a new insight into Russia's economic  problems and tasks." "I would be very glad if precisely this  happened," he said.    According to Arbatov, Russian-American relations today can  be  described as "normal on the whole." "There are neither serious  breakthroughs, nor sharp deteriorations in them. When the 'cold  war' ended, Russian-American summits lost their dramatism. It's  obvious that such summits will become routine with the passage  of time," he concluded.</p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Labour starts offensive over nursery places Labour went on the offensive over the government's record on nursery education yesterday by publishing figures which showed that Labour-controlled councils provided three times more nursery places than Conservative authorities. Mr John Major, the prime minister, said last year that he wanted universal nursery education. But Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said there was a deep split over the issue between Mr Major and Mr John Patten, the education secretary. She said: 'The secretary of state still clings stubbornly to the belief that child care, valuable though that may be for working parents, can be a substitute for proper nursery education for children. That is nonsense.' Mrs Taylor's attack signalled that nursery education will be one of Labour's main issues in May's local government elections. The figures, compiled by the Department for Education, show that 34 of the 40 local education authorities in England with the highest proportions of three and four-year-olds in nursery education are Labour-controlled. None of the bottom 25 is Labour-controlled. Newham, a Labour-controlled east London borough, came highest with 64 per cent, followed by Walsall (where no party has overall control) on 60 per cent, and the Labour councils of Cleveland, Manchester, Merton and Sandwell on 57 per cent. Gloucestershire (no overall control) had no nursery education. Mr Patten yesterday announced the first eight schools to be given approval to set up sixth forms under a new government initiative in response to the 'staying-on revolution'.</p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Moscow names acting chief for central bank President Boris Yeltsin yesterday named Ms Tatyana Paramonova as acting chairman of the Russian central bank in succession to Mr Victor Gerashchenko. She is one of the youngest of the bank's deputy chairmen and the only woman in its senior management. Ms Paramonova, 44, joined the bank's top echelons only two years ago when Mr Gerashchenko was appointed head of the bank six months after relinquishing his post as head of the Soviet State Bank at the end of 1991. She was described yesterday by Mr Andrei Illarionov, a prominent reform economist, as 'Mr Gerashchenko's right hand, but tougher on inflation than he was'. A senior western financial official in Moscow welcomed the appointment, saying that Mrs Paramonova had earned a high reputation for her tough line on credits and on the fight against inflation. However,the general view is that her relative youth, her sex and her brief time in the bank's ruling council mean that she is a temporary appointment while the struggle continues over who takes the job on a permanent basis. The state duma, or lower house of parliament, yesterday decided to postpone a debate on Mr Gerashchenko's resignation - a debate demanded by those deputies who insist that only the duma has the right to accept a resignation and to confirm appointment of a new chairman. Ms Paramonova's appointment, since it is a temporary one, does not require to go before the duma. Though the appointment fills the vacancy left by Mr Gerashchenko and stills the fears of Moscow's bankers, it leaves the main Russian financial institutions in the hands of young, inexperienced and temporary figures. Last week, Mr Andrei Vavilov was appointed acting finance minister in place of the sacked Mr Sergei Dubuinin - himself 'acting' - and his status was further compromised by briefings from presidential spokesmen to the effect that he was a 'temporary' acting minister. Her appointment comes on the eve of talks today between Russian officials and a top-level team from the International Monetary Fund on a standby loan of Dollars 4bn.</p>

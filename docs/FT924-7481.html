			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / World Trade News: London offices for Hermes and Coface EUROPE's two most powerful nationally owned export credit agencies, Hermes of Germany and Coface of France, are poised to open offices in the city of London. The primary role of both offices is in the short term to gather market information. The two insurers say the moves are linked with Britain's deep recession, which has made it essential to have the most accurate information possible on the creditworthiness of customers for German and French exporters. But the moves will also be seen as a warning to the UK's two leading privately owned export credit insurers, Trade Indemnity, and the Dutch-controlled NCM, of increasing competition to come in Europe's most open insurance market. Mr Richard Savage, appointed in March to head the Hermes office in London, said: 'The main implication is of another reputable and strong credit insurer plying its wares in the UK. We have been trying to do this from a distance. We are saying we are in the market to stay, and our presence will grow.' The main initial role will be to gather information for existing (mainly German) clients. But from its current small base of UK clients, most of them multinationals with close links with German companies, the company aims to grow 'selectively' as a domestic insurer. 'We have been writing business in competition with others for several years. It is just that now we have decided we must have a better and more important presence,' Mr Savage said. Following the recent collapse of Svenskacredit in Sweden, Hermes has also established an insurer in Scandinavia. Coface is more powerfully motivated by anxiety over the plight of UK clients as they wrestle with domestic recession: 'The aggregation of risk in UK companies is causing considerable concern,' says Mrs Bridget Spreckley, who will head the new office, to open near St Paul's Cathedral. She will be working with a risk analyst, mainly to provide French exporters with the most accurate credit information possible on UK buyers. 'We are not desperately pessimistic about the UK, but just say we need to be well informed. When credit insurance becomes difficult, getting closer becomes vital,' she added. Coface has no immediate plans to compete for UK business, Mrs Spreckley said. 'All we are doing is studying opportunities'. Private-sector competition to write export insurance has increased since January last year, following the purchase by Holland's NCM of the short-term export credit business of the government-controlled Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD). It is widely believed in the industry that by the end of the century, only four export credit insurers will exist in Europe. Coface, Hermes and NCM are expected to be competing hard to ensure they are among them.</p>

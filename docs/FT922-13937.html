			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / UK groups plan US placements THREE more UK companies are poised to raise finance in the US private placement market this week, adding to the growing number of overseas corporations raising long-term debt funding from US institutional investors. The deals come at a time of few public Eurobond offerings or large syndicated bank borrowings by UK companies. The proceeds of many of the placements are being used to repay outstanding short-term bank debt. Bankers in New York said Pilkington, the glass-maker, was considering a Dollars 200m (Pounds 116m) placement of bonds with US institut- ional investors. The securities will have a 15-year maturity. Tate &amp; Lyle, the foods group, is placing Dollars 50m seven-year bonds and Senior Engineering is raising Dollars 30m, also over 15 years. Last week, Lucas Industries raised Dollars 100m 12-year finance from a group of five US investors and Harrisons &amp; Crosfield raised Dollars 100m 10-year and 12-year funding. The deals were arranged by Wertheim Schroder and Barclay's de Zoete Wedd, respectively. Lucas used the proceeds of its placement to repay all but Dollars 30m outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the US market. Mr David Creed, Tate &amp; Lyle treasurer, said the company hoped to use the proceeds of a US private placement to refinance a maturing Dollars 100m Eurobond and repay bank borrowings in the US. However, he said firm details of the placement had not been fixed. The companies are keen to lock into long-term committed funding while banks are mostly unwilling to make unsecured loans of more than five years. With the economic outlook uncertain, banks do not want to take on exposure to corporate credit risk for long periods. The public bond markets are equally wary of corporate credit risk. Large companies can still raise funding at attractive rates in the Eurobond market, but only up to 10-years maturity. The US private placement market amounted to Dollars 160bn last year, but overseas companies accounted for only between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of the total raised.</p>

No final regulations will be issued based on the NPRM. However, the Secretary does plan to incorporate the change in program regulations implementing Title VII of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (Act). These program regulations are currently being developed to implement changes required by the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 and the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1993. The Secretary expects to publish these proposed regulations shortly. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The NPRM is withdrawn effective April 29, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Gregory March, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW., room 3124, Mary E.

Also on October 27, 1993, the Secretary published a separate NPRM (58 FR 57942) on the indicators of minimum compliance with the evaluation standards under the Centers for Independent Living Program (Indicators NPRM). The Indicators NPRM notified the public of the Nomenclature NPRM and advised the public to direct their comments on the proposed nomenclature change to the Nomenclature NPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary received 37 comments on the Nomenclature NPRM expressing a wide range of points of view about the proposed change. Commenters favoring the change generally expressed the view that the term ``significant'' is less pejorative than ``severe'' in referring to an individual's disability. These comments were generally received from commenters with an interest in the Independent Living Services and Centers for Independent Living programs authorized by Title VII of the Act. Commenters opposing the change raised several issues. Some suggested that the change is technically not accurate and that a change in meaning would result despite departmental assurances to the contrary. Others suggested that the change would be confusing and burdensome to implement and that the change should be made through legislation rather than through rulemaking. These comments were generally received from commenters with an interest in the Vocational Rehabilitation Services programs authorized by Title I of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary received 102 comments on the ``Indicators NPRM,'' of which 56 included comments on the proposed change of the term ``severe'' to ``significant.'' Of these 56 comments, only 4 expressed concern with the proposed change. Approximately 28 commenters specifically approved of the proposed change, and 24 commenters used the new terminology in their own comments, implicitly indicating their approval of the proposed change. That is, these 24 commenters used the term ``significant'' instead of the term ``severe'' in their comments, even though they did not specifically approve of the proposed change. The remaining 50 commenters expressed no views on the proposed change and did not use either of the terms ``severe'' or ``significant'' in their comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the favorable support for the nomenclature change received from the independent living community, the Secretary plans to propose the change in program regulations implementing Title VII of the Act. The proposed Title VII regulations would implement changes to the Act made by the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;569) and the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;73). The Secretary expects to publish these proposed regulations shortly. The Secretary does not plan to make the nomenclature change in any other program regulations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: April 25, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Howard R.

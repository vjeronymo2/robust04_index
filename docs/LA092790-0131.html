			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HE MIGHT BE ON FAST TRACK, BUT IT TOOK TIME;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: FRESNO STATE'S CRAVER DIDN'T PLAY FOOTBALL AT COMPTON HIGH. NOW HE IS  RATED AMONG THE BEST RUNNING BACKS IN COLLEGE.  </P> <P> Fresno State tailback Aaron Craver had no idea what to do when he graduated  from Compton High in 1985.  </P> <P> Two years later, Craver still had no plans, but he had a better idea of where  he was going: Nowhere. And fast.  </P> <P> Craver served as a volunteer youth coach at a local park but didn't have a  paying job and didn't go to college. When he wasn't coaching, he was usually in  Compton pool halls, hustling $5 games of billiards. "I made enough to get  through the day every day," Craver said.  </P> <P> But by the spring of 1987, Craver realized he wasn't the next Minnesota Fats  and knew he had better get on with his life.  </P> <P> At the urging of fellow coaches, Craver, who ran on the track team but didn't  play football in high school, enrolled at El Camino College and tried out for  the football team. Little did he suspect that the decision might put him on the  fast track to the National Football League.  </P> <P> The 6-foot, 215-pound Craver rushed for 1,355 yards and 14 touchdowns in two  seasons at El Camino and earned a scholarship to Fresno State, where he rushed  for a school-record 1,313 yards in 1989 and was an All-Big West Conference  selection.  </P> <P> The Sporting News rated Craver as the No. 1 college running back in the nation  going into the 1990 season, and Craver is off to a solid start, having rushed  for 443 yards and seven touchdowns to help the Bulldogs get off to a 4-0 start.  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy, whose Titans play at Fresno State  Saturday night, projects Craver as "a high-round NFL draft pick" next spring.  </P> <P> "I never thought this would happen," Craver said. "Every time I go to bed at  night I say, 'Dang, I can't believe this is happening.' It's weird, but it  shows you what a lot of hard work can do."  </P> <P> Of course, it helped that Craver also had an abundance of ability.  </P> <P> Tryouts at El Camino lasted five days, but after Craver ran the 40-yard dash  and caught a few passes on the first day, Coach John Featherstone told him he  had made the team.  </P> <P> Craver is speedy by tailback standards but has displayed the power of a  fullback, often punishing those who tackle him. Although he's quick enough to  run outside, he prefers to burst through holes in the line.  </P> <P> He also can catch the ball, as evidenced by his 25 receptions for 168 yards and  a touchdown in 1989 and his nine catches for 78 yards this season.  </P> <P> "I tell pro scouts that, although they might not see it in our offense, he has  the best hands of anyone I've had here since Henry Ellard," Fresno State Coach  Jim Sweeney said. "He has amazing manual dexterity.  </P> <P> "He catches footballs in practice behind his back, between his legs; he can go  long and catch. In fact, after I hang up (the phone), I'm going to go talk to  my offensive coordinator to find out why we don't throw to him more."  </P> <P> The Fresno State coaches also see room for improvement, areas where Craver's  inexperience shows up. For instance, a play might be designed for the tailback  to run to a specific gap, but Craver will go for another opening.  </P> <P> "He tries to ad-lib sometimes instead of being disciplined to stay with the  play," Sweeney said. "But he also has great instincts and tremendous quickness  for his size. Sometimes I think we over-coach him and limit his natural  ability."  </P> <P> Craver's athletic potential was a resource that went virtually untapped at  Compton High.  </P> <P> He was an accomplished Pop Warner League football player, but when he tried out  for the team in his first year at Compton, Craver said the coaches wanted him  to play receiver. He wanted to play running back or option quarterback.  </P> <P> "They said I wasn't fast enough, that I was too small, stuff like that," Craver  said. "But what happened was they had another running back coming in who was in  my grade; they didn't want to run the option, and they needed receivers.  </P> <P> "It wasn't that the coaches disliked me. They just didn't give me an  opportunity to play the position I wanted to play. I had another sport I could  do, so I said forget it and just ran track."  </P> <P> Craver was a league champion in the 300-meter intermediate hurdles as a senior  but did not receive any track scholarship offers.  </P> <P> Because he skipped the sixth grade as part of a community project to advance  brighter students through the system, Craver was only 16 when he graduated. But  he was a C student through high school, and college was not his top priority.  </P> <P> So after high school, he lived at home, which meant he didn't need a full-time  job to survive. And he didn't have much desire to continue school.  </P> <P> Then some of his friends from junior high school started getting athletic  scholarships, and that depressed Craver.  </P> <P> "I was down in the dumps then because I wished I had played high school  football," Craver said. "Coaching took my mind off my problems. I had thought  about going to school, but I didn't think I'd be that good of a player. Then I  got the guts to try it."  </P> <P> Craver went to El Camino hoping to have a little fun, capture some of the glory  he missed out on in high school.  </P> <P> Then all this happened.  </P> <P> "I'm definitely surprised at how things turned out," Craver said. "I never  thought I'd get a scholarship or anything like that."  </P> <P> Craver has a scholarship and a lot more this season -- the expectations that  accompany the label of "nation's best running back." Craver said it was an  honor, but with it came a burden.  </P> <P> "When they say you're the best, it makes you think you have to be better than  you are," Craver said. "If I run for eight yards, I think, I'm supposed to be  the best, I should have got 20 on that run. It bothers you sometimes. I may put  too much pressure on myself."  </P> <P> Sweeney said Craver shouldn't be so hard on himself because he's still learning  the position.  </P> <P> "Every time he touches the football, it's a learning experience," Sweeney said.  </P> <P> It's an experience that changed his life.  </P></p>

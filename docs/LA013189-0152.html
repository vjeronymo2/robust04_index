			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> GM SETTLES BLACK PAY BIAS SUIT  </P> <P> General Motors Corp. said today that it has reached a preliminary agreement to  pay about 10,000 black salaried employees about $3 million to end a five-year  class-action suit charging the auto maker with an unfair pay structure.  </P> <P> GM spokeswoman Patricia Malloy said the agreement covers current and former  black salaried employees in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana who claimed that they  were denied pay raises and promotions. Former employees covered are those who  worked for the auto maker between 1982 and 1986. GM estimated the cost of the  preliminary settlement at $3 million, but the leading counsel for the  plaintiffs said it could swell to as much as $40 million.  </P></p>

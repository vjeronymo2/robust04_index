			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAKING FILM MAKERS;  </P> <P> WELL-REGARDED ORANGE COAST COLLEGE MOVIE, VIDEO PROGRAM LETS THE STUDENTS DO IT  ALL  </P> <P> Alan Ruffier graduated from the film/video department at Orange Coast College  in 1986. By 1988, he had formed his own production company and written,  produced and directed his first feature film, "Bonneville, Arizona," on a  $100,000 budget that he raised himself.  </P> <P> Just 25 years old, Ruffier is now at work on "Grandpa," his second independent  feature. "It's a bigger budget ($500,000) and I'll be working with name actors  this time," Ruffier said in a phone interview this week. "It's a whole new ball  game."  </P> <P> Kent Blakely, a fellow OCC graduate and Ruffier's co-producer on "Bonneville,  Arizona," is now directing an independent feature of his own, "A Different  Life," to be shot entirely on location in Orange County in June and July. With  a local doctor as an investor, Blakely has also optioned the rights to another  screenplay that will go into production next year with a projected $2-million  budget.  </P> <P> "I'm 26 years old and I'm doing my second film," Blakely said, "and I've  already got my third lined up."  </P> <P> Ruffier and Blakely are two of the success stories that Brian Lewis, head of  OCC's film and video department, points to with pride. And the two former  students in turn give credit to Lewis -- and the program he has built on a  shoestring budget -- for giving them the tools to build their early success.  </P> <P> "I'm very grateful to Orange Coast and Brian Lewis," Ruffier said. "At OCC I  had the freedom to do what I wanted."  </P> <P> "When you're first making films, you have to have the freedom to experiment,"  added Blakely, "or you won't learn anything at all."  </P> <P> Although it lacks the glamour of more famous film schools such as USC and UCLA,  Orange Coast has quietly been building a reputation for turning out students  with a solid grasp of the technical side of movie and video making.  </P> <P> "We are the film school in Orange County," Lewis said matter-of-factly. "We're  the main game in town." It's only a 2-year program but, Lewis added, "it's  totally hands-on." While the school also teaches film theory and appreciation,  all students in the introductory courses have a camera thrust into their hands  in the first week of class.  </P> <P> After Blakely graduated from OCC, he went on to Art Center College in Pasadena  but said he learned more in his 2 years at Orange Coast. "I went to Art Center  for the degree only," the young film maker admitted.  </P> <P> When Ruffier graduated from Orange Coast, he went straight to work. "I never  went to any other schools because by the time I came out of Orange Coast  College, I knew how to make a film," he said.  </P> <P> These days, activity in Orange Coast's editing room is especially frenzied as  students scramble for equipment, desperately working to finish their film and  video projects in time for the school's upcoming festival.  </P> <P> "I came back to do some editing the other night and there wasn't any room to  stand in here," said Todd Williams, a beginning production student working on a  video to enter in the annual event.  </P> <P> Students have until Wednesday to turn in their entries. That's when the work  begins for Lewis, who must choose from as much as 40 hours worth of 20-minute  films to create a 2-hour program, to be presented Friday night in the school's  Forum theater.  </P> <P> This is the 19th festival in as many years for Lewis, who started the festival  after arriving at Orange Coast from San Francisco State University. "The first  year here (the film program) was kind of a meager offering," Lewis recalled. He  also recalled  </P> <P> how an annual festival created a focus for the program at San Francisco State.  </P> <P> The approach to student projects at other film schools is often highly  regimented, with each student responsible for just one aspect of a production.  Each of Lewis' students is assigned his or her own full project and gets a  taste of every aspect. "It's like throwing you in the water," said student Dan  Buhler. "But it really does make you work."  </P> <P> Lewis puts no constraints on style or content, which results in a wide variety  of approaches. Colleagues have asked how he can view so many student films year  after year; Lewis says that variety is what keeps him going.  </P> <P> "It never ends, in terms of the creativity of the students," Lewis said.  "There's been some great stuff."  </P> <P> Lewis screened two films from past festivals to prove his point. One was  "Rabbit," a short by Keith Fialcowitz that went on to win awards in several  international competitions. The highly polished film takes a humorous look at  the way nature turns the tables on a bored driver during a lonely haul across  the desert.  </P> <P> "Horror Brunch," a slice of Grand Guignol humor in which a peaceful Sunday  brunch turns into a blood bath, was done by Rik Carter, who has gone on to work  special effects in Hollywood.  </P> <P> Lewis also screened an early entry in this year's festival, "Under the  Windowpane," a mature and sensitive look at a father coping with the suicide of  his son. Mark W. Solter wrote, directed, produced and edited the film, with  photography by S. Emmett Fahey and original music by Todd Rogers.  </P> <P> Until 2 years ago, the festival accepted only films; now videos make up about  half the entries. Where beginning production students once worked in super 8,  now they use one of 15 video camcorders the school owns.  </P> <P> That is partly a matter of convenience -- video is cheaper and easier to use  than film -- and partly a recognition that most jobs are now in video. "You  really need to have an insight into video production," Lewis said.  </P> <P> The hands-on approach to teaching film relies heavily on having the right  equipment, which Lewis has managed to assemble -- largely through donations and  discounts -- at a time when community college budgets are notoriously tight.  Film and video-editing equipment, a screening room, mixing equipment for film,  and computers for graphics all are available to students.  </P> <P> Lewis remains the program's only full-time instructor, and now he has been  handed the school's studio production program as well. Film and video classes  fill up within the first few days of registration, so Lewis would like to  expand the offerings. "The only thing holding us back is the money," he said.  </P> <P> About half the graduates of his program go on to 4-year colleges, Lewis said,  while the other half go straight into the workplace. Of those, about half go  into theatrical and commercial films and television, while the rest find work  in Orange County's burgeoning production market, which is mostly focused on  industrial videos.  </P> <P> While Ruffier and Blakely took the independent route, largely for the creative  freedom it offers, they are the exceptions. Former student Liz Ervin, like most  of the graduates, works for others; a free-lance production assistant, she just  finished work on "To the Limit," a new Imax film from Laguna Beach-based  MacGillvray/Freeman Studios.  </P> <P> In the next 2 weeks, Ervin will be releasing the second edition of her "Orange  County Film/Video and Audio-Visual Resource Directory" which lists production  and post-production facilities, recording studios, permit information and  free-lance production people in the county. Its size -- 230 pages, up from 180  last year -- indicates the growth and size of the production business here.  </P> <P> Ervin was planning a career in social welfare when she took Lewis' introductory  film production class to satisfy a general education requirement. She soon  switched her major. "It changed the course of my career," she said.  </P> <P> Lewis' approach "weeds out the people who aren't serious," Ervin said. "If  you're really interested, you put in a lot of effort. If you're not, you drop  the class. It's a lot of work."  </P> <P> Since graduating, Ervin has hired Orange Coast students to work on her  productions, as have Ruffier and Blakely. "I've hired a few production  assistants out of OCC, and it's worked out great," she said.  </P> <P>  Orange Coast College's 19th annual Student Film and Video Festival takes place  Friday at 8 p.m. in the Forum theater, 2701 Fairview Road, Costa Mesa.  Admission: $2. Information: (714) 432-5629.  </P> <P> </P></p>

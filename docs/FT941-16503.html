			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / People: Yet more turbulence at TWA When Carl Icahn resigned as chairman of Trans World Airlines a year ago, the US carrier appeared to have embarked on a period of relative harmony, writes Frank McGurty. Just this autumn, TWA emerged from two years of Chapter 11 protection, with William Howard, a much-admired industry veteran, at the controls. Last week, Howard, 71, resigned, ending a short and not-so-sweet chapter in TWA's tangled tale. His replacement is Donald Craib, 68, a former chairman and chief executive of the Allstate Insurance Group. A TWA director for two months, Craib has no experience of operating an airline. He spent 36 years at Allstate, then a subsidiary of Sears Roebuck, starting in 1950 as a claim adjuster, and has been a management consultant since retiring in 1986. Sporting a brave face and a tight lip, the TWA board said Craib's background reflected broad financial and administrative experience. Moreover, he supported 'employee involvement in the corporate decision-making process', an important issue at a company of which the staff owns 45 per cent. Under Icahn, morale had taken a nose-dive. In announcing his resignation, the board praised the grandfatherly Howard for helping revive the enthusiasm of TWA's employees. He was reported to have clashed over strategy with Glenn Zander, 47, one of his two vice-chairman. In an ironic twist, Zander, a career TWA financial executive, also departed last week, citing personal reasons. The acrimony between the two surfaced soon after it became apparent the airline's position remained highly precarious. In November, it announced a third-quarter loss of Dollars 61.7m and analysts have questioned whether TWA's current cash reserve of Dollars 163m is adequate to see it through the lean winter months. Not surprisingly Craib is more upbeat. In fact, he plans to expand the airline's capacity over the next year - one of the pillars of Howard's strategy to distinguish TWA as a full-service carrier.</p>

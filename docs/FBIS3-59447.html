			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Petre Mihai Bacanuy: "Dictatorship in </F> Disguise"]    [Text] At the end of the year people customarily draw up  balance sheets. Unfortunately, there are very few things of  which Romania can boast. Things such as the most-favored-nation  status or the country's admittance to the Council of Europe  remain mere empty phrases for the man in the street as long as  he does not feel, in some way or other, that he does not have to  put up with cold and hunger any more. Apart from that, there is  nothing but a persistent post-socialist sadness, despite the  oscillations of the political pendulum.    No incompetence, no partial reforms, no unraveled economic  structures have been admitted by anyone, and this has exhausted  our economy and required enormous sacrifice on behalf of the  Romanians, who are trying in every way to make sense of the  years that followed the collapse of the Ceausescu regime.    Dear readers, I have to tell you that we [journalists] try  very hard to present the good things and the positive results as  well.    Unfortunately, disastrous results are far more numerous in  our country. Their list is topped by inflation, which has  increased by over 300 percent.    The Vacaroiu cabinet has survived solely because it could  count on the support of the nationalist-communist parties. Just  one of them, the PUNR [National Romanian Unity Party], was  rewarded with a number of offices of prefects, state  secretaries, ministry directors, or FPS [State Property Fund]  directors. Now that the political auction has begun at  Cotroceni [interparty talks initiated by President Iliescu to  strike a political pact], these parties are demanding  portfolios. As it is known, the PUNR wants those ministries  that deal with reform. [Democratic Agrarian Party of Romania  Chairman Victor] Surdu also wants about five portfolios for his  party. The PUNR kept threatening the government that it would  withdraw its support, but eventually it did nothing of the kind.    It is true, our country is not run by a single party any  more, but the rulers still do as they wish, because they are  holding all the control mechanisms of a totalitarian regime in  their hands. In that sense they are behaving like the members  of a single party, because that is what the government  coalition, which has monopolized all sectors, actually is. And  single parties never acknowledge the mistakes that they make; on  the contrary, they try to hide the truth and increase the  confusion. No matter what consequences their mistakes have,  they never admit them. The sole thing that they failed to  control is the press. But they found a solution to that problem  as well: They ignore it and they publish as many government  dailies as they can, which are then extensively quoted on radio  and television.    The president is still dreaming of a reformed government of  national unity. But all he is doing is acting as a stand-in for  the executive. However, the supreme state institution has  strayed away from reality. Mr. Iliescu's current  "consultations" are mere propaganda meetings intended to make  the parties put their swords down and to make the people think  he is holding the opposition on the leash. Considering the way  in which the consultations started, I am quite sure that the  whole thing will eventually turn into a manifestation of  devotion for the president.    By mid-January Mr. Iliescu will certainly summon the trade  unions as well to come to Cotroceni for "consultations" to  conclude a "social pact."    The idea of such a pact must have come to him at the end of  this dark year, after he had invented the concept of a  "political pact." Having clearly announced that talks would  begin with the parties represented in parliament to examine the  possibility of setting up a coalition government, Iliescu began  to sing another tune, the planned negotiations turned into  "consultations" intended to conclude a "political pact," and  what is even more, he launched the idea of a "minimal platform  to be signed by every party, regardless of its orientation."  The political pact is just an alibi for Mr. Iliescu, so that he  can rule authoritatively afterward. He wants to line up all the  parties and then manipulate them as he wishes, without  renouncing his political monopoly.    Cotroceni Palace admits that "the current situation has to  be  surmounted," but it does not want a different government any  more, but rather merely a "political pact." The moment the  trade unions and the civic forces slacken their pressure, they  immediately feel free to invent formulas that even children  would refuse to accept. The message of the unions is clear: no  more talks with this government. Mr. Iliescu pretends not to  understand and advances his bombastic "political pact." And  what kind of political pact? What did Cotroceni Palace  concretely propose? Everyone knows what the unions and the  opposition want. In the opinion of the rulers a political pact  means that the opposition should freeze, hold its hands up, and  say "yes" to everything that is concocted and issued as  government decrees by Mr. Vacaroiu's apparatchiks.    The amendments formulated in categorical terms by the IMF  are  not exactly the best reason for Romania's population to jump for  joy. They are long-term measures aimed at implementing the  reforms, the establishment of a market economy and a fully  democratic society. The parliamentary majority, including the  PDSR's [Social Democracy Party of Romania] allies, which have  continuously attacked the IMF, do not want public debates and a  referendum on that issue, to see who favors and who is against  that package of laws, that -- although quite unpopular -- would  still mean the beginning of reform. That is why they came up  with the idea of having it passed in a concealed way, in the  form of government decrees [issued during the parliamentary  recess], that is, actually bypassing parliament.    Or, the intention of IMF was exactly the opposite: Have the  memorandum passed though the Caudine Forks of parliament. The  reason invoked by the government coalition: The parliamentary  recess is too long to do that. And everyone knows that  parliament has not yet sanctioned the decrees issued by the  previous government and, besides, by the time the ordinances  reach parliament, not much can be altered anyway. Another  reason for their preference for the bill empowering the  government to adopt the reform measures requested by the IMF is  to protect the PDSR against the attacks of the nationalist  extremists in parliament, as the latter would have been put in a  delicate position: Should they vote in favor of the very things  that they have been cursing all along? So they prefer to have  the measures that mean the beginning of reform adopted without  anyone noticing and have the decrees cover up for the disaster  caused by the mismanagement of the country.    The opposition, which is fighting for reform, cannot reject  the bills requested by the IMF either, but it combines them with  other reform measures that cannot be adopted unless debated in  parliament. The opposition wants details about the compensation  to be offered to companies operating in the red. Otherwise,  what is the use of having a parliament? And why should reform  be promoted covertly?    This time the parliamentary majority made use of its  strength  and voted, while alone in the hall, to empower the government to  rule by decree. Despite the fact that the necessary quorum was  lacking, that the altering of fiscal bills can only be decided  by parliament, and that [Chamber of Deputies Speaker and ruling  party executive chairman] Adrian Nastase is talking all the time  about the observance of the Constitution, he is the first one to  take the liberty of ignoring it by submitting a bill to the vote  when the quorum is lacking. By validating the results of the  ballot held under these circumstances, he actually introduced a  dictatorship in disguise. He created a dangerous precedent by  using pressure and violating both the Constitution and the rules  on the functioning of parliament. [Chamber of Deputies Deputy  Speaker Dan] Martian and Nastase proved that they are prepared  to do anything and they would call for a ballot even if just the  two of them were present to vote.    The extremists are making open threats. [Greater Romania  Party Chairman Corneliu] Vadim [Tudor] is warning Iliescu that  he will "pay with his head" if the government coalition is  joined by CDR [Democratic Convention of Romania], because that  would mean that the extreme nationalist forces would be left  outside the coalition. It serves Iliescu right, let them accuse  him of treason! Let him have Vadim in opposition! He would  make such a fierce opposition -- C.V. Tudor cautions -- that the  president's political career would last no longer than just a  few weeks.    Despite this, relations are cordial between the PRM [Greater  Romania Party] and the PDSR. Mr. Nastase and Vadim seem to  understand each other without having to utter so much as a word,  despite the fact that the PRM has recently begun to attack  [Romania's National Defense Minister Lieutenant General Niculae]  Spiroiu as well.    The ruling coalition is visibly irritated. The PUNR has been  negotiating with the ruling party [PDSR], Cotroceni Palace has  seemed to favor a PUNR-PDSR coalition as a solution, and a great  deal of promises have been made to the PUNR. The latter claims  that it even has an agreement in writing signed by the PDSR.  The PUNR wanted a cohabitation, just the two of them, and it  desperately wanted to join the government. Now that it has  struck an alliance with the PDAR [Democratic Agrarian Party of  Romania], they both want portfolios, especially that of national  defense. Funar wants to replace General Spiroiu, a minister who  has survived three governments, and wants to appoint [4th,  Transylvanian Army Commander General Paul] Cheler to that  office. Cheler is the one who was threatening to open fire on  us, and now that we see that the oppression has continued in  Romania, we are ready to believe that he would really have done  so.    The trade unions accept the "social pact," a phrase also  taken over by the Presidency and used instead of the old term,  "consensus." The unions have also declared that no further  dialogue with the government would make any sense. It is true,  resignation has especially overtaken the poor. But let us not  forget that about 11 million people in Romania are poor. The  government has repeatedly postponed the deadline for the  implementation of what it promised during the negotiations with  the unions, which do not reject the reform, and rather favor it.  By telling people, via all channels, that privatization causes  unemployment, the PDSR is continuously trying to distort the  claims advanced by the unions. The message of the unions was  clear: They intended to mobilize the parliamentary majority to  vote in favor of the censure motion, that is, to depose the  government. What more does the parliamentary majority expect  besides the trade unions' consent to close down companies that  are counter-productive, operating in the red, and to reconvert  industry and the labor force? Meanwhile the trade unions have  become quite radical as they realized that the state authority  is lying to them and immediately forgets the plans put down on  paper without ever implementing them.    What else is there in the top list of 1993?    The corruption among officials should also be included. The  corruption disease is one of the most powerful forces acting for  social-political disintegration. The general confidence placed  in state institutions is vanishing just as the dossiers of the  corruption cases that have reached their climax will. We will  become accustomed to corruption. The deadline for parliament to  report on corruption cases was set for the end of 1993, but the  law- makers forgot about it. They did so for the very simple  reason that the hotbed of corruption is Cotroceni. Corruption  seems to be the moral and juridical basis of the democracy  promised by Mr. Iliescu. Messrs. Florica and Hortopan [former  high-ranking Interior Ministry officials who made disclosures  about a number of corruption cases] have convincingly revealed  in the press how the mechanism of lies and corruption functions.  However, everything remained the way it used to be, because  that is what the state authority wanted. It admitted that there  is corruption, but denied that there are corrupt people. Which  means that we did not go far enough with our revolution. The  corrupt state has not yet collapsed because it is still under  the control of those who emerged on top of the ruins of  communism and who are the enemies of radical reforms. And there  are no signs that the executive, the top of the state, will soon  be purged to eliminate political banditry. Everywhere in the  world the heads of mafia bosses and corrupt ministers are  rolling, except in our country, where they appear smilingly on  television as the champions of reform.    While compiling the 1993 top list we should not forget  Caritas [the large-scale money-multiplying pyramid scheme].  That was possible only because the Romanians, fed up with  promises and poor, are all trying to work out a magic formula  that would bring them luck and make them rich quickly. One of  the publishing houses even came out with a book titled "Caritas  or the Romanians' Salvation by Themselves." Anyway, Caritas has  managed to make a laughing stock of us Romanians all over the  world.    Tiraspol should also be included in the list with its  illegal  death sentence passed against Ilascu. Ilascu's fate has made us  forget about the chance, which we missed, that emerged  immediately after the Moscow coup attempt on 23 August 1991,  when Bessarabia, after it declared its independence, could have  united with the mother country.    And last but not least, the top list should also include his  majesty the king, who is trusted by an increasing number of  people as a force that could really bring about reconciliation.  The king announced his intention to join the Romanian nation on  the day of the 75th anniversary of the Great Union, saying he  did not know whether he would live long enough to see another  round anniversary celebration of the Great Union. The fact that  he was denied an entry visa proves that the old system is still  alive.    Such was, in broad terms, the year 1993. Somber. How 1994  will look depends on us, but also on parliament, which in its  extraordinary session scheduled to begin on 3 January will not  allow the installment of dictatorship, albeit in disguise.</p>

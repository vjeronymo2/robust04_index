			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Shulman] </F>   [Text] Azeri President Geydar Aliyev said here tonight he  plans further dialogue with Armenian leader Levon Ter-Petrosyan  but made no comments on the report claiming his meeting with  Ter-Petrosyan in Moscow on April 16.    He said today's meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin  focused on the search for possibilities of cease-fire and  negotiations.    The Azeri demands are not excessive, said the Azeri leader.  They include cease-fire in the conflict zone, liberation of the  occupied Azeri lands and negotiations to discuss the status of  Nagorno-Karabakh.    Aliyev is convinced that the two peoples are ready for  cease-fire. He stressed he "has a reliable information that the  absolute majority of Karabakh Armenians do not want to fight,  they are forced to do it, to involve in the senseless war".    The bloodshed must be stopped as soon as possible to  terminate sufferings of Azeri and Armenian mothers, and the  Armenian and Azeri presidents must agree on this, said Aliyev.    He stressed he is basically not against contacts with  Armenian representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh, however, being the  Azeri president, do not plan to have equal negotiations with  citizens of the state he heads.</p>

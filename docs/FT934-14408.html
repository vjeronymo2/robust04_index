			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Swiss miss? IN THE Weekend FT of September 11/12, Peter Martin says of enhanced scrip dividends: '. . . This is one of those wheezes from which everyone gains, except the tax man and investment trusts . . .' I live in Switzerland. As I understand it, such dividends are treated for UK residents as being net of a 20 per cent tax charge, while for foreign residents the dividend is effectively gross, as the nominal 20 per cent tax charge is not recognised in the same way as the tax credit associated with a normal dividend payment. Am I missing something, or am I effectively disadvantaged relative to a UK resident shareholder? A UK-resident shareholder pays no tax on scrip in lieu of a dividend unless 125 per cent of the 'appropriate amount in cash' (the market value of the scrip, broadly speaking), when added to his other income, brings him into the scope of either higher rate tax or age surcharge - in which case, the effective rate of tax on the 'appropriate amount in cash' is 25 per cent (20 per cent on 125 per cent) or, in a simple case, 12.5 per cent (10 per cent on 125 per cent), respectively. The 'appropriate amount in cash' is treated, for capital gains tax purposes, in much the same way as the cost of taking up a rights issue. A non-resident shareholder similarly pays no UK tax on scrip in lieu of a dividend unless 125 per cent of the 'appropriate amount in cash' brings him into the scope of higher rate tax or age surcharge (if he is a Commonwealth citizen or is otherwise entitled to age relief). Under article 10(3)(a)(iv) of the Switzerland-UK double taxation convention, however, you would be exempt from higher rate tax on such a scrip issue so, to that extent, you have an advantage over a shareholder resident in the UK. As you say, the notional 20 per cent tax deduction from 125 per cent of the 'appropriate amount in cash' is not treated like the one-quarter tax credit associated with a real dividend: this is true for residents and non-residents alike. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

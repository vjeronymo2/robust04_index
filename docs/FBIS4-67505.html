			<p>BFN     [Text] The collegium of Russia's Environment Ministry has  approved a draft program called Waste, worked out in accordance  with government instructions and designed to a formulate a  unified national policy toward handling production and  consumption waste.    To be implemented before the year 2000, the program will  require financing worth more than one trillion rubles (over 800  million dollars). The funds are to come from the federal  budget, from the Federal Ecological Fund, from regional budgets  and ecological funds, as well as from enterprises and commercial  structures.    About 7 billion tons of waste is formed in Russia annually,  with only 28 percent put to use. The total quantity of the  accumulated toxic and ecologically dangerous waste has reached  1.6 billion tons.    The program provides for utilizing the waste containing  mercury, one of the substances most dangerous to human health.  This waste will be processed at the smelting plant of the  Krasnodar mercury mines--the only facility of this kind  functioning in Russia.    According to the authors of the document, one of the gravest  problems is to utilize the waste of chromium-related production,  no country in the world has resolved yet. According to last  year's data, Russia has accumulated 9 million tons of this kind  of waste, which is stored at the Khrompik plant in Sverdlovsk  Region and at the Novotroitsk chromium combinations plant in  Orenburg Region. As the authors of the program said, should the  reservoirs containing such waste get damaged because of wear or  natural disaster, the toxic chromium may create in the basin of  the Rivers Chusovaya, Volga and Ural a catastrophic situation  comparable with the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear-power  plant.    The authors believe that the problem of utilizing the waste  of chromium-related production in Russia can be partially  resolved by means of introducing special technology, which makes  it possible to transmute chromium into a non-toxic substance and  obtain from it building materials for covering floors and  tiling. This method was devised by a research center in  Yekaterinburg.    Furthermore, the Waste program provides for processing and  utilizing some other kinds of production and consumption waste,  particularly zinc-containing waste and the waste of the  cellulose and timber industries.</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / UN persuades Croat refugees to halt march AN APPEAL by a Russian United Nations officer yesterday averted a march by Croat refugees on their former homes which would have led to clashes in Serb-held territory in eastern Croatia. Despite warnings by the UN and the Croat government of a possible massacre by Serb forces in Baranja, some 1,000 men and women refugees yesterday massed in Osijek to return to their homes, abandoned last autumn during the Serbo-Croat war. Some 77,000 Hungarians and Croats last year fled or were driven out of their homes in Baranja. Colonel Viktor Loginov, a UN officer, on a road just south of Osijek, warned the crowd to stop their march and wait for the UN to allow them to return home. 'Where will you go? Across mines and into rifle barrels? Everything is destroyed. There is no water or electricity. How will you live there?' said the Russian officier speaking in accented Serbo-Croatian. UN officials had feared the march would have led to violence and could have jeopardised the UN peace plan which has created four protected areas in Croatia. The threatened march appeared to reflect the frustration of Croat refugees who see the UN as allowing the Serbs to consolidate territorial gains made during the war. Eastern Croatia was the scene of the some of the worst destruction and heaviest bloodshed. Some Croat refugees jeered and hissed at Col Loginov accusing him of being pro-Serbian and not working to help the refugees. He said: 'I have been here seven months. We have got rid of the Yugoslav army. They used to shell Osijek every day. Are they shelling you now? No. I cannot solve this problem myself. What can you solve with rifles? You can only get your heads blown off.' Leaders of Croatia and the rump Yugoslavia were officially reported to have agreed to end military confrontation on a strategic Adriatic peninsula, Reuter reports from Geneva.</p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / The ERM Crisis: Frankfurt dives for cover from the flak - Bundesbank battens down hatches THE Bundesbank took up an increasingly embattled position yesterday, as its smaller than expected interest rate cut and an ambiguous comment by one of its directors led to confusion and criticism among economists and currency dealers. Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, a Bundesbank director, said the German central bank would not act to stop money market rates from falling below the discount rate - unchanged at 6.75 per cent on Thursday - if intervention in the European Monetary System led to a flood of liquidity. He said the bank would not offer Treasury Bills to soak up liquidity created by currency intervention. Thus call market rates could fall below the discount rate and the securities repurchase (repo) rate, now at 6.95 per cent. Mr Gaddum's comments, which appeared to go against the Bundesbank's refusal to cut official rates further, caused considerable uncertainty in the markets. 'It seems a rather crazy statement,' said Mr Gwyn Hacche, a senior economist at James Capel, the UK investment house. This week the Frankfurt-based Bundesbank cut the Lombard rate by half a percentage point to 7.75 per cent, disappointing those who had hoped for a discount rate cut to ease strains on the EMS. Further indicating the continuing pressures on the Bundesbank, Mr Otmar Issing, another director, declined to appear on a lunchtime financial television programme yesterday, having previously confirmed his attendance. While economists generally felt that the European exchange rate mechanism could not hold out in its present form much longer, they were unsure whether anything would happen this weekend. Mr Hans-Helmut Kotz, economist at Deutsche Girozentrale, called this week's Lombard rate cut 'a purely symbolic action that will only cause irritation at best'. He felt fairly certain that something would occur this weekend, in view of the burden placed on the French economy by the franc's current parity and the high interest rate levels needed to support this. 'The Bundesbank could be starting its holiday with a working weekend,' he added. Mr Adolf Rosenstock, economist in Frankfurt for Industrial Bank of Japan, said: 'We are probably already experiencing the agony or even the final hours of the EMS's fixed rate system.' In Bonn, government officials refused to comment publicly about what impact the Bundesbank's actions would have on the future of the ERM. But privately officials said they were increasingly concerned about relations between Bonn and Paris in the light of the Bundesbank's decision to give priority to the domestic economy.</p>

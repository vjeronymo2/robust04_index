			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RULING IN CAMARENA CASE FLAWED, JUSTICE DEPT. APPEAL SAYS;  </P> <P> COURTS: DECISION THAT THE U.S. VIOLATED ITS TREATY WITH MEXICO BY KIDNAPING  DOCTOR IS 'WITHOUT PRECEDENT,' GOVERNMENT SAYS. DOCTOR WAS INDICTED IN MURDER  OF DRUG AGENT.  </P> <P> The Justice Department said Thursday that a Los Angeles federal judge made  serious legal errors when he ruled that a Drug Enforcement  Administration-orchestrated kidnaping in Guadalajara of a suspect in the  Enrique Camarena murder case violated a U.S. extradition treaty with Mexico.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie's Aug. 10 ruling "is without precedent in  U.S. law," according to a government brief seeking to overturn the decision.  </P> <P> The brief, written by Assistant U.S. Atty. William F. Fahey, contends that  Rafeedie's decision misconstrued the treaty and also "brushes aside more than  100 years of Supreme Court precedents" that a forcible abduction does not  violate due process.  </P> <P> In a precedent-setting decision, Rafeedie ruled that the United States violated  its extradition treaty with Mexico when it "unilaterally abducted" Dr. Humberto  Alvarez Machain from his Guadalajara office on April 2.  </P> <P> "This court lacks jurisdiction to try this defendant," the judge declared,  ordering the government to return Alvarez to Mexico. But Rafeedie postponed  issuing the order until prosecutors could appeal.  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors immediately expressed objection to the ruling and said that  if the decision was upheld, it could impede their efforts to apprehend some of  the remaining suspects in the Camarena case.  </P> <P> The brief also contends that the extradition treaty is irrelevant to this case  because the U.S. government did not formally ask the Mexican government to  extradite Alvarez. Justice Department officials said it would have been a  futile gesture because Mexico has not extradited any Mexican national to the  United States.  </P> <P> The brief also contends that the judge's ruling "effectively usurped the  executive branch's authority to conduct foreign relations with the government  of Mexico."  </P> <P> Alvarez was kidnaped by six current and former Mexican policemen who had been  recruited by a veteran Los Angeles-based DEA operative named Antonio Garate  Bustamante. Garate, under the supervision of DEA agent Hector Berrellez,  arranged for the kidnaping and both men were present when Garate's recruits  turned Alvarez over in El Paso on Aug. 3.  </P> <P> Last January, Alvarez was indicted by a federal grand jury on five felony  charges stemming from the February, 1985, kidnaping and murder of Camarena, a  veteran DEA agent, in Guadalajara. The indictment alleges that Alvarez  administered drugs to Camarena to prolong his life so that he could be further  tortured and interrogated at the home of Mexican drug lord Rafael Caro  Quintero.  </P> <P> Alvarez has denied committing any crimes but has acknowledged that he had been  a physician for Caro and that he was at the house when Camarena was tortured.  </P> <P> The Alvarez kidnaping precipitated a major controversy between the United  States and Mexico. Mexican officials charged that the abduction violated  Mexico's sovereignty. Not long after the abduction, charges were filed against  Alvarez by Mexican officials stemming from the Camarena killing.  </P> <P> Alvarez's lawyers are expected to file a reply to the U.S. government's brief  by the end of the month. In early September, the American Civil Liberties Union  undertook representation of Alvarez solely for the purposes of the appeal. The  ACLU decided to take on the case after his attorney, Robert K. Steinberg, said  he could not continue.  </P> <P> "The issue about the U.S. government essentially going into other countries and  kidnaping someone is a significant human rights issue," Paul Hoffman, the  ACLU's Southern California legal director, said in an interview.  </P> <P> Judge Rafeedie denied Alvarez bail in late August on grounds that he  constitutes a flight risk.  </P></p>

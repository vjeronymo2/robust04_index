			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> RESTAURANT ON MAIN OKD  </P> <P> The City Council voted Tuesday to make an exception to its zoning laws to allow  a new restaurant on Main Street.  </P> <P> Jay Fiondella, who has operated Chez Jay on Ocean Avenue for 30 years, will now  be able to move the restaurant to a building he recently purchased on Main  Street.  </P> <P> "I'm elated. It's been a long, rocky road," Fiondella said after the council  approved the exemption by a 5-2 vote.  </P> <P> Council members Ken Genser and Judy Abdo said they were sympathetic to  Fiondella, but voted against the exemption because they oppose any waivers of a  city ordinance that allows only four restaurants on each block of Main Street  in the downtown area.  </P></p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Banking bill advances Legislation which would let US banks open branches across state lines leapt an important hurdle yesterday when a joint panel of the US Senate and House of Representatives approved a compromise bill. The proposal has the backing of the Clinton administration and looks set to become law within weeks, if it hits no last-minute obstructions in either Senate or House. Under the bill, bank holding companies would be able to acquire banks in other states one year after the bill was enacted. They would be able to merge their operations across state lines into branch networks after July 1, 1997. However, the bill would allow individual states to opt out of inter-state banking. The Senate/House panel failed to agree on powers which would have strengthened the administration's hand when negotiating the opening of overseas financial markets to US companies. Many barriers to nationwide banking in the US have fallen in recent years, as individual states have dropped their restrictions. Many now permit ownership of local banks by financial institutions based in other states which have similar open regulations, though fewer permit branches of out-of-state banks. Only Hawaii permits no inter-state banking. Even so, the prospect of federal legislation has spurred the growth of large regional banking groups in the US in recent years. Knowing that Congress was likely to act, many states have moved before they otherwise would have to pass their own laws. Also, the spate of big bank acquisitions in recent months is likely to have been prompted in part by opportunism among banks which benefit from the current patchwork of state regulations. Once legislation opens the takeover market to all banks equally, there is likely to be greater competition for acquisitions.</p>

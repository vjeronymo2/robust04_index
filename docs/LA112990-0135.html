			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> QUEBEC FINDS VICTORY COINCIDES WITH LUCK  </P> <P> For five weeks the Quebec Nordiques played some horrible hockey. And the few  times they did play well, their luck was poor.  </P> <P> The Nordiques, after a victory Oct. 20 over Detroit, lost 14 in a row and went  winless in 17 consecutive games.  </P> <P> Their luck changed for the better Wednesday night at Hartford. Two fluke goals  helped Quebec squeeze out a 4-3 victory over the Whalers.  </P> <P> The first two Quebec goals were flukes. Claude Loiselle's centering pass hit  teammate Jamie Baker's skate and slid between goalie Daryl Reaugh's pads for a  short-handed goal only 2:37 after the opening faceoff. Later in the period Guy  Lafleur's centering pass hit teammate Tony McKegney, who had fallen to the ice,  in the helmet and caromed into the net.  </P> <P> Nordique goaltender Ron Tugnutt stopped 40 shots, and Hartford shots by Randy  Cunneyworth and Terry Yake hit posts. With a chance to tie, Kevin Dineen,  trying to guide a shot by Ulf Samuelson, knocked it just over the net.  </P> <P> Tugnutt stopped 16 shots in the last 18 minutes.  </P> <P> "It was about time we had a little luck," Tugnutt said. "Maybe this is what we  need to turn it around. I hope so."  </P> <P> Washington 6, New York Rangers 3 -- Another long streak came to an end at New  York. The Rangers (5-0-5) had not lost in their last 10 games.  </P> <P> But rookie Peter Bondra, who had only six goals in his first 22 NHL games, had  a hat trick to lead the Capitals.  </P> <P> With Bondra's three goals, the Capitals built a 6-1 lead by the middle of the  third period.  </P> <P> Buffalo 2, Montreal 1 -- Mikko Makela's eighth goal of the season early in the  third period at Montreal enabled the struggling Sabres to get a much-needed  victory.  </P> <P> The Canadiens, who have won only twice in their last six games, heard boos most  of the night.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 5, New Jersey 5 -- Rick Tocchet scored his second goal of the game  with 49 seconds left at East Rutherford, N.J., to climax the Flyer rally.  </P> <P> The Devils had a 5-2 lead with less than four minutes remaining, but rookie  Darren Rumble and Terry Carkner scored to get the Flyers close.  </P> <P> Winnipeg 2, Calgary 2 -- The Jets spotted the Flames two first-period goals at  Winnipeg, then battled back to get the tie.  </P> <P> New star Ed Olczyk got the tying goal on a power play in the first minute of  the last period.

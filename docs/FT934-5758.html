			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Motoring: Needing to make a name for itself - Mazda's sleek Xedos enters a market in which status is vital Mazda's bid to get into the lower end of the premium executive car market is called the Xedos (pronounced ke-see-dos). Choosing this name must be a Japanese revenge for all the mickey-taking by foreigners over the funny names the Japanese have given their vehicles in the past, such as Cedric, Violet, Gloria, Cherry, Bongo (yes, I swear it) and Genteel. Even when they have thought up a good name, things have sometimes gone wrong. Wouldn't The Toyota Windom be much better as the Wyndham? But what's in a name? The Xedos 6 1.6i, Mazda's junior sports saloon, (pictured), is cast in a similar, if smaller, mould to the Lexus GS300, a BMW 530 rival that impressed me deeply. At Pounds 15,995 for the manual (Pounds 16,895 automatic) the Xedos 6 1.6i slips into the lower reaches of the executive market where it costs exactly the same as a BMW 316i Special Equipment, which might or might not be sheer coincidence. It is sleek and shapely, with not a straight line or flat surface in sight. From the front, the tiny air intake grille and slit-eyed headlamps make it look like a sleepy Siamese cat with its tongue half out. In common with the Lexus, the Xedos has been designed to cut through the air with minimum disturbance and, at business motoring speeds, wind noise is virtually suppressed at source. Perhaps this made me aware of the tyre roar on coarsely textured surfaces. But, apart from this and an occasional buzziness at high revolutions in the gears from the smooth-running and vigorous 16-valve engine, I rated the Xedos 6 1.6i a compact and comely car with delightful manners. Just as Lexus GS300 buyers or user-choosers may well graduate to an LS400 as they move higher up the management ladder, the 1.6i Xedos 6 will be a stepping stone. Next in line is the two-litre, V6-engined Xedos 6 which leads up to the flagship of the marque, the Xedos 9, with a choice of two-litre or 2.5-litre V6 engines. The Xedos 9 made its debut at the Frankfurt show last September and arrives in Britain early next year. The biggest hurdle Lexus and Xedos have to leap is entirely subjective. When executives choose new company cars, status might well rate higher than performance. For years, the business and social credibility of makes such as BMW, Mercedes and Jaguar has been well established. Although Lexus LS400 sales increased during the recession while those of most of its competitors fell, the name - unlike those of its European rivals  -still does not have instant recognition. Xedos is even less familiar. But then, so once were names like Canon, Minolta and Nikon. Just ask a photographer what happened to Leica and Contax in the precision camera market.</p>

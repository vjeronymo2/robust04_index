			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend by </F> unidentified correspondent in Vienna; date not given: "`Europe  Has Become Most Insecure'; Fasslabend Warns of Nonmembership"]    [Text] With or without entering the European Union [EU],  Austria must "do more for its security in the future because  large parts of Europe have become most insecure." This was said  by Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend, of the Austrian People's  Party [OeVP], in an interview with the APA. At the same time,  Fasslabend pointed to the numerous advantages of EU membership  in terms of security policy. The emergence of a European  security system must not automatically imply the renunciation of  neutrality, the minister said.    Nevertheless, the question arises of how to evaluate  neutrality. Even now, neutrality "has undoubtedly no longer the  function it used to have," the defense minister said. In the  current situation, a few weeks before the EU referendum, it is  better to avoid a discussion on the issue.    One should at a later stage deal with all security policy  issues, including NATO's Partnership for Peace, following the  example of Sweden and Finland. In this connection, Fasslabend  pointed out that the Federal Government had already decided that  EU accession should be combined with an observer status in the  Western European Union, the EU military arm.  <H5>  Outside Help </H5>   This would offer Austria the possibility to "participate in  the field of security policy and, in 1996, to have the  opportunity for active participation in a future European  security system," the defense minister said.    Fasslabend believes that the following advantages in terms  of  security policy would go hand in hand with EU membership: an  "undoubtedly diminished likeliness of a direct attack against  our country, the certainly quicker and more efficient help if  such a direct attack should still take place;" the increased  readiness to provide outside help for possible outside dangers,  such as a threat through missiles; and, most importantly, the  possibility of direct cooperation in crisis prevention, which  could influence the emergence and spreading of developments as  in Yugoslavia.    Fasslabend emphasized that EU accession would not be linked  to the creation of a professional army. After all, most EU  member states have compulsory military service, just like  Austria.</p>

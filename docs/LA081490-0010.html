			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> REDS REGAIN COMPOSURE, TAKE GAME AND SERIES FROM GIANTS  </P> <P> When the San Francisco Giants arrived for an important four-game series at  Cincinnati, the Reds were on the verge of losing their composure.  </P> <P> They had won only four of their previous 17 games and had blown most of a 14  1/2-game lead over the Giants.  </P> <P> But Giant Manager Roger Craig almost overnight changed the Reds into an angry,  confident team ready to defend its lead in the National League West.  </P> <P> After giving up four runs to the Giants in the first inning, three of them on  Matt Williams' home run, the Reds came back to win, 6-5, to take the series,  3-1, and stretch their lead to 6 1/2 games.  </P> <P> Craig incurred the wrath of Manager Lou Piniella when he accused pitcher Norm  Charlton of throwing a spitter, and then upset relief pitcher Ron Dibble.  </P> <P> "They lost a couple of games and they accuse our pitchers of spitters,"  Piniella said. "They can't accept we beat them. He (Craig) got us stirred up.  He did us a favor."  </P> <P> Joe Oliver's two-run double highlighted the five-run fourth that brought the  Reds from behind.  </P> <P> Houston 7, Chicago 2 -- Franklin Stubbs broke out of a one for 27 slump with  two home runs to lead the Astros to just their 15th win in 55 road games.  </P> <P> The Cubs' 20-year-old rookie, Lance Dickson, lost his second major league  start. It was only the Cubs' eighth loss in 27 games. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

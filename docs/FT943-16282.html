			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / International Company News: RWE sees 'slight' rise in profits for year RWE, Germany's largest utility, yesterday said profits for the year ended June would improve 'slightly' on the previous year's earnings of DM881m (Dollars 540.4m) and forecast strong earnings in the coming year from new telecommunications business. The electricity group said it was likely to increase its DM12 dividend for 1993-94 but gave no further details. Group turnover last year rose 5.2 per cent to DM55.8bn with foreign turnover making up 17.3 per cent. RWE said the improved turnover was due to the first-time consolidation of several companies in to the mineral resources and chemicals divisions. Turnover would have risen 2.5 per cent without the consolidation measures. The group said its worst results came from its waste management activities, where it made an unspecified loss which it blamed on competition and technical problems. Waste management is the smallest of the group's six divisions, but turnover rose 41.7 per cent to DM1bn, up from DM0.7bn the year before. A consortium led by RWE won a bid for a data transmission network, pitching the Essen-based group in to the rapidly expanding market, estimated to be worth DM2bn annually. Sales of oils and chemicals, the group's largest division, 'improved significantly', helped by stronger demand in eastern Germany. Profit margins in refining had improved but margins on oil sales were 'unsatisfactory'. The group spent a record DM7.1bn, mainly on regional power utilities in the five eastern Lander where it is now a significant operator. Electricity sales, though, rose only slightly due to slack demand as German industry pulled out of its worst post-war recession. Hochtief, the construction subsidiary, also spent an unspecified amount to take an almost 50 per cent stake in Ballast Nedam, the Dutch construction group.</p>

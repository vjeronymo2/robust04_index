			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / International Company News: Trygg-Hansa chief executive steps down Mr Bjorn Sprangare yesterday resigned as chief executive of Trygg-Hansa, citing strong criticism of his performance and uncertainty over the group's strategy. Mr Sprangare, who has led the company for eight years, said it was clear he did not enjoy the 'full public confidence' necessary for effective leadership. He is expected to leave the company during the autumn, after a successor has been chosen from three short-listed candidates. In deciding to step down, Mr Sprangare said he took full responsibility for a series of deals which ended in failure and produced heavy losses. These include the group's ill-fated alliance with SPP, the financial services group; its investment in the US insurance group, Home; and its involvement with the collapsed financial concerns, Gota AB and Svenska Kredit. Gota alone brought more than SKr5bn (Dollars 662m) in losses in 1992. Mr Sprangare said the alliance with SPP had been 'a complete failure', and his biggest mistake, leading directly to the costly investment in Gota AB. He said changes following the crisis in the Swedish financial sector were partly to blame for the breakdown of the alliance. Trygg's failure to win a banking licence, when competitors had been granted them, was perhaps the clearest sign it had lost the confidence of the authorities. Trygg yesterday announced a sharply-reduced operating profit of SKr190m for the first six months, partly because of losses linked to its 35.3 per cent stake in Home Holdings. A year ago, the group's operating profit was SKr884m. After including the full impact of the group's investment performance, it swung to a SKr380m loss from a SKr1.38bn profit. Unrealised losses caused by falling bond markets were the main reason for the decline. Group premiums fell 9 per cent to SKr3.6bn from SKr3.95bn, following the group's decision to run off its reinsurance activities. Underwriting losses deepened to SKr441m from SKr322m.</p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Gold Greenlees shares fall 50p after profits warning SHARES IN Gold Greenlees Trott fell by 50p to 225p yesterday after the advertising and marketing services group warned that City profit forecasts for the year ending next April were 'optimistic'. The group, which had a Pounds 14.7m rights issue in February at 235p a share to fund acquisitions, said it expected that interim results would 'justify the maintenance of the interim dividend' and, for the full year, pre-tax profits should exceed last year's Pounds 4.3m. Analysts had been forecasting pre-tax profits for the year of between Pounds 6m and Pounds 6.5m; yesterday they dropped to about Pounds 4.5m after the warning was issued. Recovery in both advertising and sales promotion activities in the UK has been slower than anticipated, GGT said. This had resulted in the deferral and reduction of spending by a number of clients. 'Although the board remains encouraged by the number of new business pitches by both the North American and UK agencies, these are unlikely to have the impact on this year's profitability that was originally anticipated,' the group added. GGT said earnings per share would be reduced, but a temporary reduction in the dividend cover would be justified because of its 'strong balance sheet, positive cash position and good long-term prospects'. These factors would be taken into account 'in considering the appropriate level of full-year dividend,' it said. At the time of the February cash call, Mr Michael Greenlees, chairman, said he saw 'considerable room for growth' in existing business. In June, a joint venture was formed with GGK, the privately-owned European agency network, with both sides putting Pounds 3m cash into the new company. In the year to April 30, GGT reported pre-tax profits 6 per cent higher at Pounds 4.32m. Turnover rose 18 per cent to Pounds 275.4m and the final dividend was 5p on capital increased by the rights issue, making an unchanged 8.3p for the year.</p>

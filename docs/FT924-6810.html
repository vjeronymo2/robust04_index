			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices The FT-SE Actuaries Indices Steering Committee yesterday issued its first statement. Extracts follow: THE FIRST meeting of the new FT-SE Actuaries Indices Steering Committee chaired by Donald Brydon, chairman of BZW Investment Management, was held on November 18. The meeting was to set up the practitioner committees responsible for the management of the FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices and to adopt the Ground Rules governing the new series of UK indices. The Steering Committee adopted the Ground Rules for the management of the indices and set up a review of the existing FT-Actuaries and Stock Exchange classification system. The Steering Committee wants to see a standard method established for calculating total returns, and has asked the Institute and the Faculty of Actuaries, together with Keith Percy, chief executive of Morgan Grenfell Asset Management, to make proposals to achieve this. The FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices consist of the FT-SE 100, FT-SE Mid 250, FT-SE Actuaries 350, FT-SE Actuaries 350 Industry Baskets, FT-SE SmallCap, FT-Actuaries All-Share, FT-SE Eurotrack and FT-SE Eurotrack 200. The FT-SE Mid 250, FT-SE Actuaries 350 and Industry Baskets were introduced on October 12 1992. The FT-SE SmallCap will be introduced from December 31, when the FT-Actuaries All-Share will be extended. The constituents to be included in the FT-SE SmallCap and the extended All-Share will be approved by the FT-SE Actuaries UK Indices Committee on December 3. The new practitioner committees wil take effect from January 3 next year.</p>

			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANEL'S RECOMMENDATIONS ON VITAMINS FOR PREGNANT WOMEN  </P> <P> So, the geniuses at the National Academy of Sciences now recommend that  pregnant women stop taking vitamin supplements, even though vitamin  supplementation has been shown in several studies to reduce fetal risk factors.  </P> <P> Their reasoning: They fear that vitamin supplements might delude women into  thinking they no longer need a balanced diet.  </P> <P> Brilliant!  </P> <P> In the same spirit, I offer the following recommendations:  </P> <P> 1. Immediately ban the use of automobile safety belts. Although they've been  shown to save lives, my fear is that people feel inordinately protected when  wearing seat belts and therefore do not exercise adequate caution when driving.  </P> <P> 2. Stop promoting the use of helmets for motorcycle riders. I predict  motorcyclists would be much safer drivers if they knew they had a higher risk  of head injury.  </P> <P> 3. Outlaw life preservers when water skiing. We've all seen the dangerous  stunts water skiers perform. Without life jackets, I'm sure they wouldn't be so  daring.  </P> <P> 4. Eliminate green lights. How many accidents have happened simply because a  motorist saw a green traffic light and presumed he had the right of way? By  restricting all traffic signals to yellow and red, many lives could be saved.  </P> <P> FRANK PALADINO  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 17 (YONHAP) -- China, seeking to improve  its naval forces, will import three attack submarines from  Russia this year and send some 100 sub crew members to the  Russian Navy's submarine school in Vladivostok this summer, the  TOKYO SHIMBUN reported on Thursday in a Vladivostok-datelined  story.    The three submarines China will purchase are conventional  "kilo" class ships, weighing 3,000 tons, able to cruise at 17  knots and built at the Komsomolsk shipyard in Khabarovsk in  1982, the report said, citing a ranking officer of the Russian  Pacific fleet in Vladivostok.    Russia will send the vessels to China for foreign exchange,  with their cooperation in submarine warfare involving many naval  secrets likely to influence the security of East Asian nations,  the Japanese-language newspaper said.    China is known to have plans to import 10 more conventional  submarines and one nuclear submarine from Russia within the  year, it said.    The Russian Pacific fleet sold seven warships to China last  year, including a ballistic rocket observation ship, a destroyer  and two conventional submarines.    These ships are serviceable in naval operations and China  must have commissioned them for its navy, instead of using them  for scrap iron, the Pacific fleet officer was quoted as saying.    The Russian Navy's submarine school in Vladivostok was set  up  in the early 1980s to train submarine crews from countries  purchasing Russian subs.</p>

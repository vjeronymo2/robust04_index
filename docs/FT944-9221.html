			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Telecom Italia injunction overturned Telecom Italia, Italy's state-controlled telecommunications operator, has won the second round of a legal battle with a smaller competitor attempting to break the company's monopoly in business services, writes Andrew Hill in Milan. Telsystem, a small Milan-based company, wants to lease lines from Telecom Italia to construct virtual voice and data networks for business users, and has asked Italy's anti-trust authority to examine the case. Pending a full decision, Telsystem won an interim injunction with a Milan court last month obliging Telecom Italia to lease lines. That injunction has now been overturned for what Telsystem described as procedural reasons. Telecom Italia says it favours liberalisation in the sector - in line with EU rules which have yet to be implemented in Italy - but only if properly co-ordinated. Telsystem, which says its financial situation is gradually worsening, is pinning its hope on the outcome of the anti-trust investigation, expected next month.</p>

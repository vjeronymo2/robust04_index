			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRIP OF THE WEEK: ITALIAN FESTIVAL AT SANTA BARBARA'S OLD MISSION  </P> <P> An Italian tradition comes to the steps of Santa Barbara's Spanish mission  during the Memorial Day holiday, May 27 through May 29. Artists will cover the  mission's asphalt piazza with more than 200 paintings, all created with colored  chalk.  </P> <P> The three-day display is the city's third Italian street-painting festival.  Called "I Madonnari" in honor of the Italian name for street painters, it  celebrates a tradition continued in Italy since the 16th Century.  </P> <P> Artists will be of all ages and every talent level. They are only limited by  the size of the pavement "canvases" that measure from 4 x 6 to 12 x 12 feet.  </P> <P> Each painting is sponsored by individuals and businesses, with donations to the  Children's Creative Project. The nonprofit program provides art experiences for  elementary school children throughout Santa Barbara County.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Festival and Tour  </P> <P> Visitors can watch the street artists create and afterward can view the  completed works. Festivities include a street market with Italian foods and  musical entertainment adjacent to the piazza. Hours are 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.  </P> <P> If you go to the Madonnari festival, try to tour historic Mission Santa  Barbara. In addition, visit the city's botanical garden and natural history  museum, both nearby in the foothills behind the mission.  </P> <P> To get to Mission Santa Barbara from Los Angeles, drive north on U.S. 101 to  the Mission Street exit, go right about nine blocks to Laguna Street, then turn  left to the mission grounds.  </P> <P> Sited on a hillside two miles from the ocean, the mission was started 204 years  ago on the feast day of St. Barbara. Its founder was Father Fermin Lasuen,  Spanish-born successor to Junipero Serra, who died after establishing nine of  Alta California's 21 missions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mission History  </P> <P> The church that stands at Mission Santa Barbara was built from local sandstone  in 1820. Earthquakes destroyed three adobe churches erected earlier by the  Chumash Indians.  </P> <P> The regal church is beyond a grassy expanse where the mission's cattle and  sheep once grazed. A feature is the building's Roman facade, which was copied  from an architect's book and crowned by twin towers. It's the only church in  the mission chain with two towers.  </P> <P> Visit the church and mission compound by walking beyond the Moorish fountain to  the museum, where self-guided tours begin. Early day artifacts that recall the  mission's past are displayed in eight rooms that were once living quarters for  the padres.  </P> <P> Continue to the courtyard, where Indians were taught to make leather footwear  and woolen garments and practiced other trades. They also raised crops to feed  the large Chumash population at the mission.  </P> <P> Enter through a side door into the long church to see Mexican art from the  1700s and 1800s.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Church Graveyard  </P> <P> A side door, marked by skulls, leads to the cemetery with the vaults of padres  and Santa Barbara pioneers, as well as the unmarked graves of about 4,000  Indians.  </P> <P> Beyond the cemetery gate, cross the road to view the stone ruins of the  mission's aqueduct, water reservoir, grist mill and tanning vats. In front of  the Moorish fountain is a lavanderia, where the Indian women washed clothes.  </P> <P> Mission Santa Barbara is open every day from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Sunday mornings  the church is used for services and closed to tours until 1 p.m. Admission is  $1, children under 16 free.  </P> <P> Drive to the right around the mission onto Mission Canyon Road that climbs up  the Santa Ynez Mountain foothills. Look for signs and drive to the Santa  Barbara Museum of Natural History.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Marine Wonders  </P> <P> Next to the parking lot is the 72-foot skeleton of a blue whale that washed  ashore at Vandenberg Air Force Base in 1980. Other marine life, as well as  animals, birds and insects, are on display inside the rambling Spanish-style  buildings.  </P> <P> The museum began in 1916 with a collection of bird eggs that was expanded into  a notable exhibit of birds, including waterfowl found along California's  shores. Also look for California's native wild animals displayed in lifelike  dioramas.  </P> <P> The Indian Hall has artifacts of various North American tribes and features the  local Chumash. Special planetarium shows take place on Saturdays at 3 p.m. and  Sundays at 1:30 and 4 p.m.  </P> <P> The natural history museum is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sundays and  holidays from 10 a.m. Admission is $3, teen-agers $2, under 12 years $1 on  weekends and holidays; entry on other days is by donation.  </P> <P> Drive back onto Mission Canyon Road and follow signs to continue north (with a  brief jog on Foothill Road) to the tranquil Santa Barbara Botanical Garden.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Education in Native Plants  </P> <P> Covering 65 acres near Los Padres National Forest, the garden is devoted  exclusively to the state's native trees, shrubs and wildflowers. In the garden  shop are trail maps to the various plants.  </P> <P> One walk covers a grove of coast redwoods, over a dam built in 1807 to supply  water to the mission, then along Mission Creek and past desert flora back to  the parking area.  </P> <P> Free guided tours are offered Sundays and Thursdays at 10:30 a.m., with an  extra tour Sundays at 2 p.m. The garden shop is open daily and has plants for  sale Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday.  </P> <P> Visitors are welcome at the botanical garden every day without charge from 8  a.m. until dusk. However, no picnicking is permitted.  </P> <P> Get dining and lodging information by calling (805) 965-3021. Or stop at the  new Visitors Information Center at the corner of Santa Barbara Street and  Cabrillo Boulevard (two blocks east of Stearns Wharf). Hours 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  daily.  </P> <P> For more information about the Italian street-painting festival, contact its  director, Kathy Koury, at (805) 963-8654.  </P> <P> Round trip from Los Angeles to Mission Santa Barbara is 220 miles.  </P></p>

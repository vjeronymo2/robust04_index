			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Anglia TV plans curb on salaries ANGLIA TELEVISION has announced cost-cutting measures including a decision not to incorporate any increase into pay until 1994. Instead, the company will next month make a single lump-sum payment to all staff equivalent to a 4 per cent annual increase. The sum will not be consolidated in pay. The move follows a three-year agreement in which staff received additions to pay proportionate to rises in the cost of living. Unions at Anglia were meeting last night to decide their attitude to the offer and a secret ballot is likely. Mr David McCall, the Anglia chief executive, declined to comment last night while negotiations are continuing. In addition to the pay freeze changes are also being made to overtime payments at the television station. Anglia staff have also been warned that 300 production jobs in Norwich are dependent on the company's winning commissions from the the ITV network. Under the new commercial television regime that begins in the autumn, all the ITV companies and independent producers will be free to bid for programme commissions.</p>

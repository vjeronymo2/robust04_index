[Vaynberg] That is a very complex and painful issue. Mil  helicopters are being series produced today at plants in Kazan,  Rostov and Ulan-Ude. Some 25,000 helicopters have been produced  over all this time, of which 15,000 are in service. Five  thousand helicopters have been supplied to 60 countries around  the world. Mil helicopters provided 30--50 percent of the  currency receipts from all aviation exports of the USSR.    The Moscow firm consists of the KB [design bureau] itself,  where the development of the helicopters right through to the  creation of working drawings takes place, production, where the  experimental prototypes are manufactured, the flight-test  complex and the test beds, where testing to determine the  service life of the item and its systems and assemblies is  performed.    The documentation is refined and passed along to the  series-production plants after the performance of the testing  and customer acceptance of the helicopter. The firm had its own  branches of various sizes at each series-production plant. The  largest was at the Kazan plant, which reached 1,000 people in  size. The branches adapt our documentation to the specific  features of the actual plant. Those branches have become  independent design organizations today, but strategically they  depend on the Moscow KB, which heads an association of the  developers of Mil helicopters. I repeat that the branches are  economically independent, but are subordinate to the Moscow KB  on questions of technical policy. The series-production plants  may put out only Mil type helicopters under these conditions.    This question is painful because after the collapse of the  USSR, various types of commercial structures were formed, with  the aid of which the former republics have begun to sell  helicopters without any preliminary technical expert evaluations  and technical preparation, and moreover at very low prices, at  dumping prices. Not only selling, but also leasing. The facets  of reliability and safety have been lost. The situation needs to  be regulated.    We have been forced to seek a way out of this situation. I  appealed to the Prime Minister of Russia, I wrote that this is a  very complex issue; the discussion concerns billions of dollars,  but nothing has come of it. The Mi-8MT or Mi-17 helicopters that  are series produced in Russia are objectively worth 4--5 million  dollars, but various structures are selling them for 500,000  dollars. This leads to the fact that the series-production  plants are forced to sell them for 1.5 million dollars,  i.e. the losses reach four million dollars per  helicopter. The Kazan Aircraft Plant puts out about 200  helicopters a year, and the losses for that plant alone are  about 800 million dollars a year.    We have been forced to take severe measures. The firm has  announced that the name Mil will be removed from helicopters  that have not been sold through our own expert evaluation. The  owners of helicopters without the observance of our requirements  do not have the right to sell the helicopters under the name of  Mil. The KB is declining all responsibility for those  helicopters. This has been (or is being) reported in all  countries with Mil helicopters, and is being stated at press  conferences and international meetings.    Another problem arises as a result of the separation of the  firm of Mil, the series-production plants and the repair and  operational organizations. Government organizations have ceased  to engage in the coordination of enterprise operations. Each  enterprise has to survive on its own today.    I have sent all of the series-production plants a proposal  to  conclude contracts. The firm of Mil assumes all of the  obligations of assisting in the sale of the helicopters,  performing market research and certifying and upgrading  helicopters apropos of the requirements of the international  market. The plants should pay the firm a certain share from each  craft sold.    We intend to conclude a similar agreement with the  operational organizations as well.    It is very important to conduct an active technical and  marketing policy.    Our country has to wage a very tough fight against other  nations, especially the United States, in the international  market for military products. I do not rule it out that the  bizarre conversion that is taking place here has not arisen  without the involvement of the United States. The correct  attitude has only recently begun to be felt of just what our VPK  [military-industrial complex] is, and what role it can play in  lifting up the country's economy. We will hope that the IDEX-93  exhibition in Abu Dhabi will prove to be a positive move on this  issue. Russia will be selling cheaper than other countries to  restore its lost position and win new ones in the international  arms market. This is advantageous for the country and for the  Russian defense industry all the same.    Some of the currency received from the sale of weapons must  be invested in our military industry, so as to raise the market  competitiveness of its products in the international market and  carry out genuine conversion in the country.    [VPK] The KB used to work principally on orders from the  Ministry of Defense. What is the situation today?    [Vaynberg] All of the fundamental projects are being carried  out under orders from the military. Refinements under orders  from the Ministry of Civil Aviation are made for civilian  purposes. This makes up at best about 20 percent of the overall  financing. Orders from the Ministry of Defense of Russia and  direct budgetary work within the context of the state program  for the development of civil aviation constitute about half of  the required financing today.    [VPK] Almost all enterprises in the VPK today are in a  difficult economic position. How do matters stand with your firm?    [Vaynberg] The times we are living in are difficult, but  unusually interesting for people who do not think dogmatically  and can approach their work creatively. There are many  situations that require non-standard solutions. We still have to  adapt to today's conditions.    Several joint structures have been created at the  enterprises--we have been able to make their work more active.  The firm earned a solid amount of money over October-December  1992 as a result.    We are engaged in engineering and making use of know-how.  Our  teams of specialists often go out to study and organize the  repair of helicopters on site.    All of this has made it possible to stabilize the economic  situation of the enterprise, and elicit interest in the work  among our colleagues. The drain of specialists has slowed. The  average wage at the enterprise is not high, but it is no worse  than others. To this should be added free medical care, and food  subsidies for the cafeteria. The children's institutions and  rest homes for the workers that the KB had have been preserved.    I fell that we still have to preserve a firm that is a  national treasure of Russia.    [VPK] How do you evaluate Mil helicopters compared to  foreign  ones?    [Vaynberg] We are beyond competition in heavy helicopters.  The Mi-26 helicopter, for instance, transports 20 tonnes, and  there are no other such craft in the world.    We are at the same level as Western firms in helicopters in  the medium class. The Western light helicopters are better than  ours. We were not occupied with that class at all for a long  time, since we had no orders for them. Light helicopters are  often procured for personal needs, like a passenger car, in the  West, after all. We are now developing the Mi-34 light  helicopter, and will launch it immediately at two  series-production plants.    A second light helicopter is under development, and we are  planning to send it up in August of 1994. A heavier helicopter,  with a mass of about two tonnes, is planned to be put out in  roughly three years. A helicopter with a mass of 4--5 tonnes is  also starting to be developed. This area has begun at the KB,  but it requires greater efforts, because we have little  experience in the development of the light craft.    [VPK] What relationship do you have with the Kamov firm?    [Vaynberg] They are our competitors, and that is a normal  phenomenon. Roughly 95 percent of the helicopters produced in  the country today are Mil, and only five percent are Kamov.    [VPK] It was reported on the radio that your firm is being  privatized, and 85 percent of the shares of stock will be under  the ownership of the your workforce. Is that so?    [Vaynberg] The situation is actually as follows. Fifty  percent of the shares of stock, of which 25 percent will be  non-voting, will be held by the firm. Fifteen percent will be  sold to major investors, and 35 percent will be sold at auction.  Our task is to buy the maximum number of shares from that  portion, and to see that they do not go to unscrupulous dealers.    I feel that it would be proper for a controlling block of  shares to remain with the state, since the firm of Mil is a  national treasure of Russia, and the state should protect its  treasures. But we have not been given that option; either a  state or a private firm.    [VPK] Military reform is underway in Russia, along with the  formation of mobile forces. What will be the place of your  helicopters in this, and don't helicopters of a different type  hold the advantage here?    [Vaynberg] I submitted a report to the Ministry of Defense  of  the Russian Federation at the beginning of 1992. I wrote that  since the armed forces of the country would be cut back  substantially, it would be advisable to create a new branch of  the troops--mobile forces--and that it needed to be done  immediately and with the least possible expenditures. I proposed  that the Mi-8 and Mi-17 helicopters that were in service with  the troops--and there are thousands of them--be upgraded and  provided to the mobile forces in the next five years. The  upgrading should provide for the operation of the helicopters at  any time of day and in bad weather conditions, i.e.  under all of the natural and weather conditions in which the  armed forces operate. Our firm could carry out that upgrading  quickly and relatively cheaply.    It would be expedient to create special helicopters and  flying infantry fighting vehicles in the future that would not  only carry an assault force, but also would be able to provide  fire support for the subunits landing from them. The helicopters  should thus be equipped with missile and other high-precision  weaponry. Both the helicopter crew and the assault personnel  should be well trained as professionals.    It seems to me that the mobile forces should be equipped  specifically with helicopters and not other types of aircraft. A  helicopter, as opposed to those others, can hover in the air and  over a spot, can go up quickly and hide quickly behind some  obstacle, and can move almost along the ground. Other types of  aircraft do not possess those traits. A dirigible is difficult  hold over a spot in strong winds, and is moreover very  noticeable and easily defeated by anti-aircraft weaponry, as  well as requiring ground equipment for servicing and vital  support.    I thus feel that helicopters best satisfy the requirements  of  the mobile forces. The organization of those forces is underway  in the Ministry of Defense today, as far as I know, and I hope  that my report played some role in it.    I thus feel that our firm has a good future, and its  products  will be needed by the armed forces of Russia, as well as perform  many tasks for the national economy.

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / World News in Brief: Cult link seen as 48 people die in Swiss villages Forty-eight people, believed to be members of a cult which originated in Canada, died in a suspected collective suicide in Switzerland. Police found the bodies in a barn basement at Cheiry, near Fribourg, and in three burned-out ski chalets at Granges-sur-Salvan, 160km away. It is believed the fires may have been triggered automatically. The cult, known in Canada as the Order of the Solar Temple, is headed by Luc Jouret (above), a 46-year-old homeopathic doctor, whose whereabouts were not known yesterday. In Quebec police said they believed the deaths in Switzerland were linked to an arson fire that killed two people in a house next to one owned by Jouret north of Montreal.</p>

			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'IF YOU'RE PUTTING A COMBUSTIBLE IN THE HANDS OF A CHILD, IS THAT SAFE OR SANE?  IT JUST DOESN'T FIT.' -- CAPT. HANK RAYMOND,ORANGE COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT;  </P> <P> SENTIMENT BURNS IN SOME TO COMPLETE THE BANNING OF FIREWORKS  </P> <P> Independence Day may be filled with fireworks, but Nancy Corcoran of Costa Mesa  no longer wants anything to do with sparklers, Piccolo Petes or Ground Bloom  Flowers.  </P> <P> In fact, she has stopped volunteering at a local soccer club's stand in Costa  Mesa selling the "safe and sane" fireworks. She has seen what their contents  can do.  </P> <P> Her son, Christopher Doyen, 17, suffered second-degree facial burns Sunday  after he and a younger brother emptied the contents of a dozen Piccolo Petes  into a plastic box and ignited the powder with a match, police said. The box  exploded in Christopher's face, making the youth Orange County's first  fireworks victim this year.  </P> <P> "We will throw all our fireworks out," Corcoran vowed Monday, moments after her  son returned home from an overnight stay at UCI Medical Center in Orange.  "After you see all the pain and all . . . we went through, I don't want to see  another firework again."  </P> <P> Corcoran said her son is fortunate to be home to celebrate the Fourth of July.  Christopher's face was badly burned and his eyebrows singed, but his eyesight  was unaffected, his mother said. He avoided further injury by not inhaling the  lung-choking powder found in the cylindrical fireworks that emit a piercing  whistle and a shower of sparks when lighted. Nor will scars remain on her son's  face, doctors told her.  </P> <P> But other Orange County residents, most of them children, haven't been so lucky  in years past. Some have had their fingers or hands blown off by legally  obtained fireworks. Others have suffered long-term eye damage or severe burns  on their faces, arms, legs and feet.  </P> <P> There were 29 fireworks-related injuries reported in Orange County hospitals  from June 17 to July 16 last year, the peak fireworks season, and 278 in the  state, according to the state fire marshal. But those numbers are thought to be  "the tip of the iceberg," said state Fire Prevention Engineer Ed Seits, because  many injuries are either treated at home or at facilities that do not have to  report to Sacramento. Other estimates in the county range from 50 to 106.  </P> <P> "We teach kids not to play with fire or fireworks," said Fountain Valley Fire  Chief Richard Jorgensen, former president of the Orange County Fire Chiefs  Assn. "Yet, in the frenzy of celebrating the Fourth of July, we put dangerous  fireworks in their hands. We're saying it's OK to use them and risk injury."  </P> <P> Jorgensen and others who oppose fireworks other than in controlled settings say  they don't want to see injuries continue as another Fourth of July tradition.  However, those who support the use of "safe and sane" fireworks say they are  part of the holiday, and that more supervision and knowledge is needed to  prevent injuries.  </P> <P> "Safe and sane" fireworks, a term used by the state fire marshal to describe  fireworks that cannot explode or fly into the air, are legal in only seven  Orange County cities: Buena Park, Costa Mesa, Fullerton, Garden Grove, Orange,  Santa Ana and Westminster. They are banned in unincorporated Orange County.  </P> <P> Critics say such fireworks are neither safe nor sane.  </P> <P> " 'Safe and sane' is a misnomer," said Jorgensen, who successfully lobbied for  the ban of fireworks sales in his city. "I have personal problems with that.  There are those called 'safe and sane' which can cause almost the same kind of  damage as illegal ones."  </P> <P> </P> <P> County Fire Captain's View  </P> <P> Orange County Fire Department Capt. Hank Raymond made his point with the aide  of a dictionary.  </P> <P> Fireworks are "explosives or combustibles," he said, reading from a dictionary.  Safe, he said, means "free from injury." And sane implies making a "sound  judgment."  </P> <P> "The words have the opposite effect," Raymond said. "If you're putting a  combustible in the hands of a child, is that safe or sane? It just doesn't  fit."  </P> <P> In Christopher Doyen's case, his mother said he did not use the fireworks as  directed.  </P> <P> "He feels it was a wrong thing to do," Corcoran said. "He shouldn't have been  fooling around with them. They used them like they shouldn't have."  </P> <P> Licensed pyrotechnists and fireworks manufacturers say parents must educate  their children about the dangers of fireworks and that they must supervise them  and encourage safe practices. "If you use them as they're designed to be used,  they're basically harmless," contended Jim Souza of Pyro Spectaculars, a Rialto  company that staged fireworks for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and the 1986  Statue of Liberty centennial. "It's when people throw them or place them where  they don't belong that you have problems."  </P> <P> Under state law, no one under 18 may buy fireworks where they are legal. But  often fireworks wind up in the hands of those who don't know the dangers.  </P> <P> This summer, in the third year of drought, dry roofs and shrubs are  particularly vulnerable to fire, officials point out. But buildings and plants  can be replaced, they said. Fireworks-related injuries can carry long-term  scars that make it difficult for victims to lead normal lives.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'No Such Thing as Safe'  </P> <P> Several families declined to talk about injuries to loved ones, but those who  work with fireworks victims say injuries have ranged from shattered fingers and  hands, from fireworks being held at the moment of ignition, to eye injuries  from flying sparks.  </P> <P> "There is no such thing as a safe firework," said Caryl Modrinski, executive  director of the Orange County Burn Assn., an education and support group that  works with patients in UCI Medical Center's burn unit. She said many injuries  occur when people tamper with fireworks, either by opening packages or mixing  powder with other substances.  </P> <P> Burn patients from such mishaps have a difficult time recovering  psychologically, especially in a beauty-oriented society, Modrinksi said.  </P> <P> "Initially, you've lost your identity," she said. "That's very hard for a child  to deal with."  </P> <P> Sue Martinez, nursing manager of UCI Medical Center's burn unit, has worked  with patients injured by fireworks. "I have yet to see any argument for them  that makes sense," she said.  </P> <P> Among the so-called "safe and sane" fireworks, sparklers are the most  dangerous, County Fire Department Capt. Raymond said. Seemingly harmless, they  burn at more than 1,000 degrees and cause about 30% of all fireworks injuries,  he said. They are also a fire hazard. A sparkler ignited the largest fire in  Tustin's history, destroying a 90-unit apartment complex in 1980.  </P> <P> Illegal fireworks, many of them imported from China and Taiwan, include  inch-long firecrackers, which can cause severe hand injuries, and M-200s, which  have enough explosive force to blow off a finger, experts said. Those convicted  of using such illegal fireworks face a fine of up to $1,000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Out of Control'  </P> <P> Although proponents of legal fireworks argue that lack of precaution by a few  ruins festivities for others, county and state fire officials won't be  satisfied until fireworks are banned everywhere.  </P> <P> People sometimes lose their sense of judgment in the passion of celebrating the  nation's birthday, Jorgensen said.  </P> <P> "It gets to be out of control," he said. "With a little lack of control, people  behave as they normally wouldn't. Some people wouldn't think of doing such  things at other times."  </P> <P> One problem, Jorgensen said, is that fireworks may be purchased by mail from  states where all fireworks are legal. In Orange County, people who live in  cities where "safe and sane" fireworks are outlawed can walk across the street  to legal stands, he pointed out.  </P> <P> Instead, fire officials urge people to attend the large municipal-sponsored  firework displays run by licensed pyrotechnists scheduled throughout the county  tonight.  </P> <P> Raymond advised those planning to use legal fireworks to read instructions  carefully, keep a bucket of water nearby, refrain from taking fireworks apart,  watch for duds and avoid holding fireworks while they are discharging.  </P> <P> "Some say it's our right to celebrate our independence," Jorgensen said. "But  while we do that, we burn other people's homes and we injure people. We should  use more respect on our most important national holiday."  </P></p>

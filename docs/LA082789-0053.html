			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 SURVIVE CRASH OF VINTAGE PLANE IN LOT NEAR HAWTHORNE AIR SHOW  </P> <P> A pilot who wanted to show spectators that his pre-World War II aircraft could  still fly was cut and bruised Saturday when his two-passenger plane crashed  into an empty parking lot a block from a Hawthorne air show, officials said.  </P> <P> Don Krattiger, 49, and his wife, Pat, 43, of Valencia were taken to Martin  Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center's trauma unit for treatment but neither was  believed to be seriously hurt, said Battalion Chief Bruce Bradford of the  Hawthorne Fire Department.  </P> <P> The single-engine Ryan PT-22 apparently experienced engine oil problems as it  approached the Hawthorne Municipal Airport, said Leo Gay, the air show's  coordinator.  </P> <P> Had the plane not veered off to the north of the runway when it was coming  down, it very likely would have crashed into parking lots crowded with cars  belonging to air show visitors on busy 120th Street or on Crenshaw Boulevard.  </P> <P> Instead, witnesses said, the pilot appeared to turn the aircraft north just  before crashing. The plane hit an empty parking lot, tore a small bus stop  shelter from its pilings and came to rest against a chain link fence, its  yellow wings crumpled and its silver and yellow nose gear heavily damaged.  </P> <P> "He made a very good decision," Gay said. "It was not a crash. It was a forced  landing."  </P> <P> Witnesses said the Krattigers pulled themselves from the wreckage before help  arrived. "They were very lucky," Bradford said.  </P> <P> No aerial acrobatics are performed at the annual Hawthorne Air Faire, but  vintage and modern planes fly in and out. They are on exhibit while on the  ground. Gay estimated that 7,000 people attended the show Saturday. It resumes  today.  </P> <P> Hawthorne Police Sgt. Henry Mashack said the pilot apparently wanted to show  spectators that the plane could still fly and had circled the air field before  the accident occurred.  </P> <P> "Spectators said the prop (propeller) had stopped before the plane came down,"  said Robert Trimborn, Hawthorne airport manager.  </P> <P> The air show was not interrupted by the incident.  </P></p>

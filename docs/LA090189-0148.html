			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PLAYTIME AT THE DOLL HUT;  </P> <P> TINY ANAHEIM ROCK 'N' ROLL BAR TO STAGE FINAL FLING FOR THE PONTIAC BROTHERS  </P> <P> Playing for free, now we got some fans tonight -- down at the Doll Hut. -- from  "Doll Hut," the Pontiac Brothers  </P> <P> John Mello's dream was to open a little pub, a rock 'n' roll hangout where  musicians like himself could drop in during their off hours, have a beer and  establish some out-of-the-spotlight camaraderie.  </P> <P> A singer and record producer based in Anaheim, Mello spent two years planning a  move into the bar business with his wife, Linda. Their search ended a few  months ago when the Mellos called to answer an ad for a place that had gone up  for sale.  </P> <P> "The broker," Mello recalls, "said, 'It's called the Doll Hut' " -- and Mello  immediately said he'd buy it. "I didn't even need to know the price," he  recalled last weekend, sitting at the bar. "I already knew everything I needed  to know about it."  </P> <P> Turns out he'd done some drinking at the tiny wooden barroom on Anaheim's South  Adams Street, so he knew it met the funkiness quotient that he was looking for.  On the outside, it was a red-painted, weather-worn, one-room cabin, a  50-year-old building that really was almost doll-size. On the inside it was a  functional, unadorned pub where the chief attractions were cheap drinks and  darts.  </P> <P> No ferns, no decorating scheme, no trendiness. The total antithesis of Orange  County mall culture. Best of all, Mello knew that the Doll Hut came with its  own little slice of rock 'n' roll lore: The Pontiac Brothers, one of the more  honest and unpretentiously rambunctious alternative rock bands of the 1980s,  had honored the place by naming an album after it, and plastering a close-up  picture of the Doll Hut's blue neon sign on the album's back cover.  </P> <P> The band broke up last year, having released three critically praised but  commercially under-appreciated albums that combined the raw, basic crunch rock  of the Rolling Stones with the emotional immediacy of the Replacements. The  Pontiac Brothers will get together Saturday night for one last fling, playing  for free -- down at the Doll Hut.  </P> <P> The reunion will be a farewell-to-Orange County show for the Pontiacs'  guitarist, Ward Dotson, who will move to New York City in a few weeks.  </P> <P> Dotson said he used to pass the Doll Hut on his way to work, and decided to  drop in one day when he saw a sign advertising a "60 lunch."  </P> <P> "It was a beer, a hot dog and a bag of chips," he recalls. The Doll Hut became  a regular watering hole for the Pontiac Brothers, even though the other  regulars were hardly a rock 'n' roll crowd.  </P> <P> "We used to practice about two miles from there, and afterward we'd get a few  drinks and plan band strategy," Dotson said. "We'd walk in there and double the  occupancy. I never saw more than 10 people there until after (Mello) bought  it." Dotson said that the band "never, ever" saw any other rock musicians  hanging out there. "There would be guys from the train yard nearby. We used to  see this guy down there that just got out of the pen. We'd listen to him ramble  on forever."  </P> <P> When the Pontiacs put out their first album for an American label in 1985, they  called it "Doll Hut" and put on a free show at the bar to celebrate the  record's release. The album didn't feature a song called "Doll Hut," however --  an oversight that the Pontiac Brothers corrected on their next album in a tune  that mentioned some of the regulars by name. The song's release gave the band  another excuse for a free show at the Doll Hut.  </P> <P> "After the album came out, they'd give us free stuff all the time," Dotson  said. "They thought we were Van Halen or something."  </P> <P> Since Aug. 1, the Doll Hut has been run by the Mellos, who are considerably  more savvy about rock 'n' roll. John Mello, 29, has put his music production  company and recording session vocal work on hold temporarily while establishing  the bar -- a two-person operation he shares with Linda, who left her job as an  AIDS relief social worker to help run the place.  </P> <P> Mello said his aim is to turn the Doll Hut into a regular hangout for musicians  along the lines of the Commonwealth Pub, a now-defunct bar that was a magnet  for the local rock scene in Fullerton during the mid-1980s. The Pontiac  Brothers, in fact, got their  </P> <P> start at the Commonwealth Pub when, under the name Gall Stones, they began  playing covers of Rolling Stones songs just for the fun of it.  </P> <P> "It was the rock 'n' roll hangout," Mello said. "Social Distortion, the  Adolescents -- everyone used to hang out there." The Doll Hut, he said, will be  "just a place to come and have cheap beer and play if they want to play. I want  the feeling of camaraderie, the feeling of musicians going in there to have a  good time, leave their egos at the door, and not have to worry about the  politics of the music business."  </P> <P> With a legal capacity of 50, the Doll Hut won't try to compete with the area's  admission-charging concert clubs. It doesn't have a sound system, or even a  bandstand, so musicians will simply set up on the floor in the one empty corner  that isn't occupied by the bar, the pool table or the dart board. No admission  will be charged.  </P> <P> Last Saturday, an Austin, Tex., band called the Rattlers turned up to play,  having discovered the bar while staying in the area. Fullerton rockers Cheezboy  have also appeared. Members of the hard rock band Danzig have dropped in, Mello  said, and so has Robin Williams, brought in one afternoon by one of Mello's  friends in the entertainment business.  </P> <P> "No one even recognized him," Mello said.  </P> <P> While building a younger rock following, the Doll Hut's new owners still aim to  keep the working-class regulars from the bar's pre-rock days. The other night,  a few longtime customers sat at a corner of the bar while younger rock fans  surrounded the Rattlers in one corner or shot pool in another.  </P> <P> "It don't bother me," said Chris Grundy, one of the pre-rock regulars. "It's a  nice change."  </P> <P> "The previous owners catered to older people. These kids are really turning it  over. I like it," said Gil Lopez, a gray-haired customer who has been coming to  the Doll Hut for six years. "There's music. It's alive."  </P> <P> The Pontiac Brothers play Saturday night at 9 and 11 at the Doll Hut, 107 S.  Adams St., Anaheim (at the corner of Manchester Avenue). Admission is free, but  capacity is limited. Information: (714) 533-1286.  </P></p>

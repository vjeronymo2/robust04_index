			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with 'Abdallah al-Hadrami, director </F> general of the Yemeni Economic Corporation, by 'Abd-al-Malik  al-'Ayzari--live or recorded]    [Text] [Al-Hadrami] Thank you very much for giving me this  opportunity. I would just like to reassure the brother citizens  that the basic foodstuffs are available. Ships are arriving at  the ports with all kinds of foodstuffs including rice, sugar,  flour, wheat, milk, and other things. These are being  distributed all over the republic.    As for our corporation, its branches are fully open to our  citizens so that they may obtain their needs easily and at  official prices. If there are difficulties in receiving any  commodity in areas where there are no branches of the  corporation, the latter loads trucks and sells these materials  directly from the trucks. Let the people be reassured. The  corporation's branches contain all the basic commodities. The  corporation is at the service of all and during all  circumstances.    [Al-'Azari] Thank you, brother 'Abdallah. Would you like to  offer any advice in this regard?    [Al-Hadrami] I just want to reassure the citizens and tell  them that the country is in good shape and Yemen is proceeding  from one victory to another. The available foodstuffs, whether  in the stores or on the road to the stores or arriving at ports  are sufficient. There are no shortages or disorders in supplies.  The greedy merchants will be made to account for their actions.  The Supply and Trade Ministry has already warned them.  Citizens should cooperate with the state in this regard and  must report all those who tamper with the prices and those who  exploit the situation and hoard foodstuffs.    [Al-'Ayzari] This means there is no shortage of any basic  foodstuff?    [Al-Hadrami] No, everything is available. The strategic  reserves are there and the ships are arriving, and the branches  are full. Everything is available.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Although not required, an anteroom may increase the effectiveness of the isolation room by minimizing the potential escape of droplet nuclei into the corridor when the door is opened. To work effectively, the anteroom should have positive air pressure in relation to the isolation room. The pressure relationship between the anteroom and the corridor may vary according to ventilation design.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Upper-room air UVGI may be used as an adjunct to general ventilation in the isolation room (Section II.F; Suppl. 3). Air in the isolation room may be recirculated within the room through HEPA filters or UVGI devices to increase the effective ACH and to increase thermal efficiency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Health-care facilities should have enough isolation rooms to appropriately isolate all patients who have suspected or confirmed active TB. This number should be estimated using the results of the risk assessment of the health-care facility. Except for minimal-and very low-risk health-care facilities, all acute-care inpatient facilities should have at least one TB isolation room (Section II.B).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Grouping isolation rooms together in one area of the facility may reduce the possibility of transmitting  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> to other patients and may facilitate care of TB patients and the installation and maintenance of optimal engineering (particularly ventilation) controls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Discontinuation of TB Isolation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;TB isolation can be discontinued if the diagnosis of TB is ruled out. For some patients, TB can be ruled out when another diagnosis is confirmed. If a diagnosis of TB cannot be ruled out, the patient should remain in isolation until a determination has been made that the patient is noninfectious. However, patients can be discharged from the health-care facility while still potentially infectious if appropriate postdischarge arrangements can be ensured (Section II.E.5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The length of time required for a TB patient to become noninfectious after starting anti-TB therapy varies considerably (Suppl. 1). Isolation should be discontinued only when the patient is on effective therapy, is improving clinically, and has had three consecutive negative sputum AFB smears collected on different days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Hospitalized patients who have active TB should be monitored for relapse by having sputum AFB smears examined regularly (e.g., every 2 weeks). Nonadherence to therapy (i.e., failure to take medications as prescribed) and the presence of drug-resistant organisms are the two most common reasons why patients remain infectious despite treatment. These reasons should be considered if a patient does not respond clinically to therapy within 2&hyph;3 weeks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Continued isolation throughout the hospitalization should be strongly considered for patients who have MDR-TB because of the tendency for treatment failure or relapse (i.e., difficulty in maintaining noninfectiousness) that has been observed in such cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Discharge Planning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Before a TB patient is discharged from the health-care facility, the facility's staff and public health authorities should collaborate to ensure continuation of therapy. Discharge planning in the health-care facility should include, at a minimum, (a) a confirmed outpatient appointment with the provider who will manage the patient until the patient is cured, (b) sufficient medication to take until the outpatient appointment, and (c) placement into case management (e.g., DOT) or outreach programs of the public health department. These plans should be initiated and in place before the patient's discharge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Patients who may be infectious at the time of discharge should only be discharged to facilities that have isolation capability or to their homes. Plans for discharging a patient who will return home must consider whether all the household members were infected previously and whether any uninfected household members are at very high risk for active TB if infected (e.g., children &lt;4 years of age or persons infected with HIV or otherwise severely immunocompromised). If the household does include such persons, arrangements should be made to prevent them from being exposed to the TB patient until a determination has been made that the patient is noninfectious.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> F. Engineering Control Recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. General Ventilation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section deals only with engineering controls for general-use areas of health-care facilities (e.g., waiting-room areas and emergency departments). Recommendations for engineering controls for specific areas of the facility (e.g., TB isolation rooms) are contained in the sections encompassing those areas. Details regarding ventilation design, evaluation, and supplemental approaches are described in Supplement 3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Health-care facilities should either (a) include as part of their staff an engineer or other professional with expertise in ventilation or (b) have this expertise available from a consultant who is an expert in ventilation engineering and who also has hospital experience. These persons should work closely with infection-control staff to assist in controlling airborne infections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Ventilation system designs in health-care facilities should meet any applicable federal, state, and local requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

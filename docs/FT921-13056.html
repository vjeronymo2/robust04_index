			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / TSB tests photo credit-cards TSB, the sixth-largest UK banking group, is breaking ranks with the other big lenders and introducing a trial scheme of putting photographs on credit cards. Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, is leading government pressure on the clearing banks to put photographs on credit cards to help combat fraud. TSB will offer the chance of full-colour photographs to some of its credit-card customers. The big four clearers - Barclays, NatWest, Lloyds and Midland - say they are not convinced that putting photographs on plastic payment cards would help to reduce fraud. In private they claim that the government is trying to push the banks to put photographs on cards as a substitute for a formal identity-card scheme. Royal Bank of Scotland has operated a trial scheme with black-and-white photographs on cheque guarantee cards for nearly three months. Selected customers holding the TSB Trustcard Visa card will be invited to submit photographs for the trial, which will last a year. About 15,000 card holders in the Brighton area will be included. Photographs on credit cards have proved unexpectedly popular with customers. Earlier this week Royal Bank said it was extending its trial scheme to 77,000 customers because of high demand from card holders. The large banks are sceptical of the usefulness of photographs on cards, saying they will not be more effective than existing security controls.</p>

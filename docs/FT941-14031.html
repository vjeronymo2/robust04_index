			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Fresh review for Rosyth naval base The Ministry of Defence has told employees at the Rosyth naval base in Fife that it is once again reviewing its future. The base adjoins the Rosyth naval dockyard, whose future was last summer guaranteed until 2005. The base, which employs 1,800 civilians and involves 4,000 naval personnel on land and at sea, was reprieved from closure in July 1991. The review follows a statement in December by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, who said he was setting up a study to look at ways of reducing the forces' spending on back-up services to meet heavy cuts in the defence budget from 1996. On current plans the civilian workforce will drop from its present 1,800 to 1,300 by April next year, the MoD said.</p>

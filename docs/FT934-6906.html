			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Iraq probe told of data for Thatcher Baroness Thatcher was kept informed about Iraq's military procurement programme by her intelligence chiefs even though crucial intelligence was kept from some Whitehall officials and enforcement agencies, the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry heard yesterday. Mr Eric Beston, a senior Department of Trade and Industry official, said that in early 1989 the then prime minister had seen intelligence 'digests' which suggested the involvement of British companies in Iraq's attempts to build up its nuclear capability. The 'digests' refer to the reports of the Joint Intelligence Committee, the Cabinet Office's main intelligence arm to which the heads of the intelligence agencies belong. Mr Beston said that a Whitehall subcommittee called the Working Group on Iraq Procurement was set up to monitor the Iraqi military programme. But it was wound up after a short period because the intelligence services withheld information from it. 'The minutes of the committee began to fall off,' Mr Beston said. 'We never did get anyone from M15.' He also gave details of mistrust and inter-departmental rivalries undermining the functioning of a second committee which included Customs officials and which was also meant to improve the efficiency of intelligence dissemination within Whitehall. He told the inquiry that Customs officials attending this second committee, known as the Restricted Enforcement Unit, felt that other agencies were not telling them what they knew. 'On occasions Customs felt they were giving more than they got. There was a certain rivalry between agencies,' Mr Beston said. Mr Beston, who was formerly responsible for export controls and licensing on goods at the DTI, was a key witness in the trial last year of three former director of Matrix-Churchill, the Midlands-based machine tool manufacturer. He told the inquiry that as a result of the trial he had seen a number of government documents confirming that information had been withheld by the intelligence agencies. During the trial the government tried to stop the publication of the documents, but their decision was overturned on orders of the judge. Lady Thatcher's role in the arms-for-Iraq affair was never clarified during the Matrix-Churchill trial. This collapsed after it emerged that businessmen who had been prosecuted for illegally exporting arms for Iraq had been working for UK intelligence. But Mr Beston is the latest witness to suggest that the official knowledge about Britain's involvement in the arms trade with Iraq in the 1980s was widely shared at cabinet level. Yesterday's evidence has also refocused attention on the role of the intelligence agencies in informing the government. The inquiry continues.</p>

"We want to ensure the national interests of both states on  their outer frontiers," Nikolayev said at a meeting with Kazakh  frontier forces senior officers. He said one of the serious  problems to be resolved is the possibility for Russian officers  to serve in Kazakhstan and for their Kazakh counterparts in  Russia. About 270 border troops officers have filed  applications requesting their transfer to Russia, according to  the Kazakh frontier forces headquarters.    On December 24, 1993, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,  Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan signed a memorandum on  cooperation to protect their outer frontiers. The memorandum  stipulates that the protection of borders is their common task  which should be carried out on the basis of bilateral or  multilateral agreements.    If Russia and Kazakhstan iron out the existing  disagreements,  the talks may result in the signing of a bilateral document on  cooperation in border protection. Nikolayev has been authorised  to sign such an agreement by President Boris Yeltsin.    Speaking about the general situation in the Russian border  troops, Nikolayev said they will number 250,000, plus 30,000  workers and employees. At present, there are 206,000 people in  the border troops and more 7,000 vacancies for officer positions.</p>

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Cyprus group can lift stake in Airbreak AIRBREAK LEISURE Group, the USM-quoted tour operator, could be 47.07 per cent owned by Champion Holdings, a private Cyprus-based leisure company, by September 25 if Champion exercises options agreed on September 18. Last November, Champion started to build - via a share subscription for a total Pounds 2m - its current 12.85 per cent stake. However, it can lift its stake to 42.12 per cent if it exercises options to buy up to 13m shares from Airbreak directors for Pounds 1 per block of shares. The Takeover Panel has said that, because the exercise price is de minimis no obligation to make a full takeover is triggered. If the proposed sale of Sunsail International, which Airbreak acquired for up to Pounds 8m in January, goes through, Champion can then further raise its stake by acquiring - also for Pounds 1 - the 2.2m shares owned by Mr and Mrs CRC Gordon, who came to Airbreak with Sunsail, as part of their exit deal. Champion is owned by Mr Takis Shacalis, who was a non-executive director of Airbreak between January 16 and September 7.</p>

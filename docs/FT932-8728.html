			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Nuclear industry cautioned on safety THE nuclear industry has not paid enough attention to the role of human error when setting safety standards, the Health and Safety Commission, the government advisory body, says. In two reports published yesterday the commission urged the industry to 'maintain safety standards in the face of competing pressures' - such as the pursuit of profit. Human error was responsible for the incidents at Chernobyl and Three Mile Island, the world's worst nuclear accidents, as well as the Clapham rail disaster and the Piper Alpha oil explosion, the commission argued. Professor Terry Lee, a member of the commission's advisory committee on the safety of nuclear installations, which wrote the reports, said that a 'step change' would be needed to bring about a 'culture of safety' in the nuclear industry, although technological standards were already extremely high. Nuclear site operators felt that they had 'got as far as they can with introduction of technological fixes and now are on a plateau', he added. He recommended that the emphasis shift to people. He said that even small details such as employees' 'age and being maritally contented' may be relevant to safety. Professor John Hockney, chairman of the commission's advisory committee, expressed concern at the growing amount of nuclear waste stored at nuclear sites. 'We are not saying it is unsafe, but we would rather have it in one place,' he added. The committee is anxious because plans for an underground store for nuclear waste to be built by UK Nirex, the nuclear industry's waste disposal company, are progressing so slowly. The Pollution Inspectorate's report on the public consultation about Thorp, British Nuclear Fuels' controversial nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield, now appears unlikely to reach Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, before the end of the month.</p>

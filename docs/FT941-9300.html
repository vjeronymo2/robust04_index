			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (15): Invisible electronics are the key - Results service / Light beams on the ice surface will trigger equipment capable of timing speed skaters to one hundredth of a second. Commentator information systems will disseminate worldwide the results of events within one second Performances have improved remarkably but the basics of skiing and skating have changed little since the Winter Olympics were last held in Norway. The technology underpinning the management of the Games has undergone a revolution, however. The timing, data processing and security systems which will be used in Lillehammer would have seemed miraculous to competitors and spectators in Oslo, 42 years ago. Even by today's standards, they are something special. Light beams on the ice surface will trigger electronic equipment capable of timing speed skaters to one hundredth of a second - one thousandth of a second on the luge. The results of events will be disseminated worldwide within one second of the finish. Complete and detailed maps of each site and every location, down to individual chairs and tables, are available from a computer database at the touch of a button. Police resources will be monitored by satellite and controlled by a computer system developed by Andersen Consulting. Technological innovation extends to the physical environment of the Games. Advanced construction techniques have been used to create structures of remarkable grace and strength. The laminated wood beams which support the vaulted roof of the 22,000 sq m. Olympic Hall at Hamar, to be used for speed skating, are an unprecedented 96m in length. A special low-vibration dynamite was used to blast a vast cavern 120m into a mountain side in Gjoevik to create an ice hockey rink. The houses nestling on the mountain suffered nothing more than a few broken windows. But it is the electronic systems, invisible to competitors and spectators alike, that are the technological wonder of Lillehammer. They fall into three main categories: First, the timing and scoring systems, the responsibility of Seiko of Japan. The company is spending some Dollars 10m to install and operate systems for the 11 events where a competitor's time is the only guide to his or her performance-including speed-skating, downhill and cross-country skiing. Some 80 technicians, 15 managers and 300 specially trained volunteers will be on site during the Games to tend the equipment which must be able to perform at temperatures down to -20C. Seiko's technology is simple in principle. The competitors break light beams which trigger electronic timers. Time and speed are computed automatically and fed to the judges and to the results and media information services. There are, for example, nine sets of light beam units, each comprising two beams 10 metres apart, down the Alpine skiing course. A competitor's time and speed can be monitored all the way to the finish. The trick, however, is to make the equipment work every time in sometimes appalling conditions. There are contingency plans to prevent moose interfering with the equipment. Seiko technicians switch on each beam unit as a competitor approaches to prevent, say, a rabbit leaping across the course and triggering the timers. The company is using its new HD1000 slit video system to replace conventional photo-finish equipment for the short track speed-skating. The Seiko system scans an ultra-thin line precisely aligned with the finish 1,000 times a second. The resulting high definition image is stored in semiconductor memory and is immediately available for replay and examination. Wet process photography, by comparison, can take as long as two minutes for developing, printing and reading. Second, the information technology systems. International Business Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer, has signed an agreement with the International Olympic Committee through which it will provide computer systems for the next four Olympics, summer and winter. IBM will also act as project manager for the army of software houses and systems integrators developing special systems for the Games. One advantage will be that systems developed for one Olympics can be improved and used in future Games. The Olympic Commentator Information System (CIS), for example, source of the flood of results and information about competitors that will emerge from Lillehammer during the 16 days of the Games, was developed originally more than a decade ago by a handful of students at Sarajevo university. Now, IBM and an Oslo-based consultancy, Avenir, have turned it into an easy-to-operate system for the radio and television commentators covering the Games. Mr Erik Anderson, Avenir senior consultant with responsibility for the CIS, recalls his shock on being told that none of the commentators would be available for training. They would expect to be expert after five minutes' familiarisation. Keyboards and elaborate computer commands were out. The answer has been IBM's top-of-the-range PS/2 personal computers with touch-sensitive screens and colourful graphics. IBM is providing enough computers to equip a large commercial company. Three large mainframes, two in Oslo and another - for security - in a secret site, provide the raw computing power. Some 3,000 workstations and 500 printers will disseminate the results. More than 150 IBM engineers will be on call during the Games to maintain the equipment. Everything has been duplicated for security,' says Mr Dag Sanne, director of management services for IBM Norway. While the technology is sophisticated, it is also tried and tested. The data processing load is not huge, but there can be no irrecoverable failures during the two weeks of competition. For the first time in the Olympics, IBM is combining conventional mainframe data processing with networks of personal computers. It makes possible 'Info '94', a comprehensive information system available to all 50,000 or so accredited personnel - athletes, team officials, journalists and Games staff  -during the Games. All that is needed to gain access to the system is an accreditation number. The terminals have touch screens and users can rapidly find results, biographies and weather reports - or send electronic mail messages to each other. The final category is administration and management. Computer-aided design methods have been used to develop a pictorial record of every site and location. The system has proved invaluable for the planning, design, building and detailed management of every arena and building, down to signposts and fences. The Lillehammer Olympic committee was able to save NKr5m by being able to calculate exactly how much security fencing would be required. In previous Games, whole barnloads of tables, for example, have been found surplus to requirements after the competitions ended. Accreditation, ticketing and accommodation systems complete the package. Many have been adapted from systems used in the last Winter Olympics in Albertville, France. Written using a computer-aided software engineering technology developed by Andersen Consulting, it took, according to Mr Frode Finne, the Lillehammer Olympic Organising Committee's management systems project leader, only a couple of weeks to convert the French systems to Norwegian.</p>

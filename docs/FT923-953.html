			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Arts: Joey Calderazzo/Barbara Thompson - Jazz A funny thing about jazz, especially when it is performed in bars, is that the group may have met only hours before they take to the stand. Having rehearsed together for an hour or so in the afternoon they go out with some standards and follow the leader using eye and ear contact more than charts to find the way. Some leaders helpfully telegraph their direction while others simply do what they always do and leave their sidemen to come along if they want to. Pianist Joey Calderazzo takes a third option and apparently enjoys the company of strangers. A contender, along with the likes of Julian Joseph or Marcus Roberts, for the hearts of youthful modern jazz fans, Calderazzo is a likeable and unpretentious young man. Heard at the Jazz Cafe earlier this week without his regular band but with Britishers Winston Clifford (drums) and Gary Crosby (bass), the American showed why Blue Note, and his occasional sidemen, like him. A nimble player, with an unforced tone, he has a teeming right hand and a way with minor chords on the left. Well modulated in delivery, his technique is to work up to a swinging number from an almost standing start - egged on here by Clifford's tough Art Blakey-like drumming. The exchange of energy in a trio is usually exciting because the three way dynamics demand it. At the Jazz Cafe Calderazzo seemed keen to make the three sides equal and as a result rationed his solo work to great effect. Thus, original ballads which started innocuously soon developed into full steam ahead workouts as Calderazzo bounced across the keyboard. A new trio recording with drummer Peter Erskine and bassist John Pattitucci, his third date for Blue Note, is due in February and promises to be an interesting proposition. Having a less happy time in clubland (The Vortex) without her regular band was saxophonist Barbara Thompson. Boldly tackling originals such as 'Secret Soul' and 'Jaunty' from the recent album Breathless, as well as standards like 'The Man I Love', Thompson's playing was sweet and unfussy. Some uncertainty happening around her and an extremely noisy house conspired to detract from the clean and vocal phrasing which fought for a fair hearing, however. Better to catch her at Ronnie Scott's other club in Birmingham up to and including the September 26 where she will be surrounded by her usual Paraphernalia.</p>

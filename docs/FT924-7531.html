			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Improved package could seal ITN restructure A DEAL is close on the Pounds 30m restructuring of Independent Television News, the news organisation now owned by the ITV companies. The consortium led by Mr Michael Green's Carlton Communications trying to take over ITN will today put forward an improved package to representatives of ITN shareholders. Although negotiations are still continuing it is likely that two of the three big companies which will determinme the outcome of the deal, Thames Television and Yorkshire Television, will agree to sell their shares. The third, Granada Television, will take a significant stake in the reconstructed company. The initial proposal put forward last month by Carlton, Central, London Weekend and Reuters offered Pounds 1 a share and new funds of up to Pounds 30m. ITN has a Pounds 5m a year deficit on the lease of its new central London headquarters. As part of the deal, the four consortium members would get 80 per cent of ITN. Last week's deadline passed without agreement and talks began on a revised proposal. A number of elements are now under consideration. There will be extra money for those who lost their franchises such as Thames. For continuing ITV companies there will be a larger slice of shares so that Granada and a number of other ITV companies will still have a voice in ITN. The most important element is ITN's news supply agreement with the TV companies which is to average Pounds 53.3m a year over five years. Companies such as Yorkshire are only likely to sell if there is a review after two years so they can benefit from any cost savings resulting from the reconstruction. There will also be debate about how the payments are phased over the five year contract period. Because ITN's articles of association will have to be changed for the deal, which requires a 75 per cent majority, any two out of the three large companies which are not members of the consortium - Thames, Granada, Yorkshire - can block it. If the new package is endorsed by the ITN board tommorow it will go to the Independent Television Commission for approval on Thursday.</p>

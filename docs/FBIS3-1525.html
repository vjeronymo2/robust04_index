			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Summary From Poor Reception] "President Felix  Ange-Patasse this morning signed a treaty on the harmonization  of business law in Africa." Senegal was represented by "Justice  Minister Jacques Baudin, who is Senegalese President Abdou  Diouf's special envoy. The ceremony took place at the  Renaissance Palace in the presence of Prime Minister Jean-Luc  Mandaba, government officials, and the head of state's adviser.  The signing of this treaty took place a few hours after the  head of state received the Senegalese minister. On this  occasion, President Felix Ange-Patasse made a statement in which  he touched on the importance of true African integration."    [Begin Patasse recording] "Mr. Minister and special envoy  from my brother, President Abdou Diouf, we receive you here  today joyfully to sign this treaty on the harmonization of  business law in Africa. We are now signing this treaty, because  the Central African Republic was absent at the CFA franc zone  talks held on the sidelines of the francophone summit in  Mauritius. During our visit. During our visit to Dakar,  President Abdou Diouf asked me if he could send the minister of  justice" to sign this treaty, which is one of the elements which  can promote cooperation among African countries. "We have  signed this treaty because we believe in the real integration of  Africa." There are clauses that must disappear because  businessmen cannot settle in this or that country because their  respective laws are not the same or because these laws portray  nationalistic feelings. "African countries are faced with  difficulties because they do not have complementary  legislation." The moment has come for Africans to unite.  Europe is united. The United States is united. Asia is  united. But Africa is always late. Instead of giving priority  to consultations and dialogue for a real takeoff, we are groping  around. [end recording]</p>

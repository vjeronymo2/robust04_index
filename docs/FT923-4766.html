			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Cookson recovers to Pounds 34m COOKSON, the industrial materials group, underlined its continuing recovery yesterday by announcing a substantial increase in interim profits following its restructuring. The pre-tax figure doubled from Pounds 17m to Pounds 34m in the six months to June 30, while earnings per share bounced back to 4.2p (0.9p). The interim dividend is unchanged at 3p. Turnover from continuing operations grew by 4 per cent to Pounds 605m (Pounds 581m). Excluding acquisitions, the increase was 2 per cent, reflecting 'difficult trading conditions' caused by the world recession. Total turnover, including discontinued operations, was Pounds 609m (Pounds 676m). The company has focused on controlling costs and overheads. Employee numbers have been further reduced in all divisions, and stand at 12,500, down from a peak of 16,000. Redundancy costs of Pounds 1.2m compared to Pounds 1.6m last time. Mr Robert Malpas, chairman, said the results showed Cookson was continuing its recovery. Operating profits rose 39 per cent to Pounds 43m. The figure of Pounds 31m for the previous first half included Pounds 3m from discontinued operations. All four reorganised divisions - electronic materials, ceramics, engineered products and plastics - reported improved profits. A significant reduction in the level of borrowings during 1991 resulted in reduced interest charges of Pounds 9m (Pounds 14m). However, at the end of June net borrowings were Pounds 211m, compared to Pounds 142m at the end of December, and gearing increased from 33 per cent to 53 per cent. The increase in borrowings was attributed to the seasonal rise in working capital and the cost of acquiring the additional 50 per cent stake in Stern-Leach, which resulted in the consolidation of Stern-Leach's Dollars 66m (Pounds 33.1m) borrowings into the balance sheet. COMMENT Cookson is a recovery stock making good on its promise without any help from trading conditions. The company's new - and streamlined - senior management team has made creditable progress towards stripping the unwieldy group back to its core but they have further to go. Expect more disposals businesses, though not at fire sale prices. Full-year pre-tax profits are projected at about Pounds 72m, for a prospective p/e of 10.5. The shares stood last night 36p below their 170p high for the year. If trading conditions improve they could recover quickly that lost ground despite some dollar translation risks.</p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tea price fall baffles London traders A FALL in the price of tea from a peak struck at the beginning of May is baffling tea traders, who say that the effect of the droughts that have hit production around the world has worsened. Quality tea fetched 155p a kilogram at this week's London auction, compared with 180p early last month and 150p at the beginning of the year. Traders, who were convinced that a sellers' market was emerging, say that prices have gone off the boil in other world markets. About 60,000 tonnes of production has been lost in the first quarter because of droughts in Africa, southern India and Sri Lanka. Many areas are are past their peak growing periods, so that the lost output is irreplaceable. World supply and demand has been roughly in balance at 2.5m tonnes, according to Mr Illtyd Lewis, executive director of the UK Tea Council. Now traders are estimating a 25,000 tonne deficit at the end of the year. 'That's not a lot, but in the context of a finely balanced market it's quite interesting, he said. Stocks in consuming countries are low. In the UK basic stocks are down to about 30m kgs from last year's 34.4m kgs, itself considered to be a low level. The wild card remains the CIS. Traders believe the Russians are in the market for tea, but believe they are having problems arranging finance for their trade with India. Mr Lewis said the market would remain tense until the size of the north Indian crop is known in a few weeks' time. 'The market could be very volatile if a big buyer like the CIS comes back in,' he added. 'Everything is very tight - there is no give in the market.' The UK was last year once again the single biggest importer of tea, having been displaced in 1989 and 1990 by the former Soviet Union following the nuclear accident at Chernobyl, which affected local tea crops. The UK imported 178,000 tonnes, of which 32,000 tonnes were re-exported, according to the annual report of the Tea Council, published yesterday. Tea remains the most popular drink in Britain, with 80 per cent of the population drinking it daily compared with coffee's 56.6 per cent. Average consumption was 3.56 cups a day last year, compared with 1.68 cups of coffee.</p>

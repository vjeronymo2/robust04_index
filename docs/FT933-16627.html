			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Asda Property calls for Pounds 16.3m ASDA PROPERTY Holdings yesterday announced a Pounds 16.3m rights issue on a 2-for-5 basis to finance more property deals. The Davidson family, which owns a controlling stake, will not take up its rights entitlement which will be placed with institutions. Its stake will be reduced from 56.5 per cent to 40.4 per cent. The cash call involves the issue of 22.4m shares. The group is gradually pulling out of the tenanted residential sector, which accounts for just 10 per cent of its holdings. It has reinvested the money in commercial property, which has absorbed Pounds 42m in new acquisitions since September 1991. The rights issue will reduce the company's gearing from 135 per cent (treating convertible preference shares as debt) to 85 per cent. However, Mr Tony Roscoe, managing director, said Asda was expecting to make about Pounds 30m of acquisitions by the end of the year which would push gearing back to its pre-issue level. 'The board believes that the combination of a large number of unwilling holders of property and the relatively small number of well-financed active property companies specialising in the smaller end of the sector will mean that further attractive opportunities to make selective acquisitions will be available,' it said. COMMENT Despite the glut of rights issues from property companies that need to be absorbed by institutions, Asda's cash call will probably be well received. The company is generally well liked in the City, having made some shrewd investments at the bottom of the property cycle. This issue will give it the opportunity to make another Pounds 30m of acquisitions, which will be focused on small, high yielding property where there is scope to improve value by active management. The issue involves a relatively modest dilution of Asda's assets of about 2 per cent. The Davidson family's decision not to take up a rights issue may benefit the company in that it will increase the liquidity of the shares. Where the company's other shareholders are concerned, the issue is likely to be supported.</p>

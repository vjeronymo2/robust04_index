			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Banks act in Ireland, Denmark and Spain DENMARK'S central bank cut its official discount rate to 7.25 from 7.75 per cent yesterday and its other key short-term interest rates from 8.5 to 8.0 per cent following the Bundesbank's cut on Thursday. This was Denmark's fourth cut in the discount rate since late July, when interest rates were raised to protect the Krone from speculation prior to the partial suspension of the exchange rate mechanism. The Danish currency rose after the cut, lifting from the previous close of DKr4.0255 against the D-Mark to DKr4.0120. Mr Henning Christophersen, Denmark's EC budget commissioner, said interest rates in Denmark, where inflation is running at just over 1 per cent, remain high and continue to dampen investnment. There was a need for a further reduction in rates, he said. Meanwhile, the Bank of Spain, which had already lowered its benchmark intervention rate by half a percentage point last week, yesterday surprised the markets with a further 25 basis points cut that brought the rate down to 9.25 per cent. The bank said the favourable domestic economic circumstances that had prompted last week's cuts continued in place and allowed the authorities to shadow lowered rates elsewhere in Europe. Ireland yesterday also cut its key short term facility rate - the rate at which it lends money to the commercial banks - by 0.5 per cent to a new level of 7 per cent. Dublin economists said the development was unlikely to lead to early cuts in Irish retail bank or mortgage interest rates.</p>

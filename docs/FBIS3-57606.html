			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Pavel Spirin, Vladimir Fedoruk </F> and Georgiy Shmelev]    [Text] Beijing January 27 TASS -- "In shaping its foreign  policy Russia proceeds from the strategic character of its  good-neighbourly relations with the People's Republic of China.  All the necessary prerequisites have been created in relations  between the two states for ushering in a new stage of  constructive partnership", Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev told Chinese political scientists at the People's  Diplomacy Institute of China here today.    "Two 'continents' of modern civilisation -- Russia and China  -- have firmly embarked upon the road of good-neighborliness and  cooperation," he noted. "Traffic along this road was opened by  President Boris Yeltsin's official visit to the People's  Republic of China. Today, it is high time to consider the  possibility of holding a second summit meeting, possibly already  this year."    The head of the Russian Foreign Ministry formulated several  principles of Russia's "Eastern policy", which proceeds from the  growing importance of the region for the country's future. The  Russian Federation maintains stable and balanced relations with  all the nations, realising that the system of inter-state  relations in the region, as in the world as a whole, has always  been and will remain multi-polar.    The danger of major military conflicts is now lesser than  ever since the end of the Second World War. "However, Kozyrev  continued, there are quite significant sources of tension, not  only inherited from the `Cold War', but also engendered by new  problems. They include the problem of access to the resources  of the Pacific ocean, including the sea bottom, and several  border disputes. The upswing of religious and nationalistic  extremism has found dramatic expression in Afghanistan, and is  now threatening Tajikistan." [quotation marks as received]    "If we fail to resolve these problems in Asia by joint  efforts, we shall be risking to get a very `explosive mixture',  indeed," he added. "The most important question of all is the  danger of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and missile  technologies. Such a turn of events is not in the interests of  the security of the entire region, including Russia, China and  India," the minister stressed.    "The economic role of the Asia-Pacific region, which already  accounts for 60 per cent of the world's industrial output, will  apparently grow even further. In this sense, the XXI century  will doubtlessly be known as the `Pacific age'. This growth of  national might will not pose a threat to neighbours, but on the  contrary, will create conditions for economic growth. In Asia,  as in other parts of the world, economic progress contributes to  progress in ensuring man's basic rights and liberties," Kozyrev  stated.    Touching on the phased formation of a joint security system,  the minister noted that Russia moves to set up a centre for  preventing conflicts, to found a regional institute for  scientific research in this domain.    At the same time, Kozyrev moved to draw up principles for  weapons trade in the Asia-Pacific region, based on  recommendations of the U.N. Security Council. Moreover, the  Russian foreign minister believes that it is necessary to rule  out attempts to interfere with normal commercial deals on the  armaments market under trumped up excuses.    Kozyrev believes that both countries could jointly make an  important contribution to regional security and cooperation.  Guided by its policy of good-neighborly relations with the  People's Republic of China, Russia remains fully dedicated to  the principles of the Declaration on the Principles of Mutual  Relations, signed at summit level at the end of 1992. This  includes the entire complex of commitments assumed by both sides  not to use force against each other in any form whatsoever,  including the commitment not to be the first to use nuclear  weapons. This is in line with the spirit and defensive nature  of Russia's new military doctrine," Kozyrev said.    Kozyrev noted with satisfaction the Russo-Chinese  cooperation  in the U.N. Security Council. However, he said that  peacekeeping and the implementation of peacekeeping operations  remained among the most acute problems. He especially noted  that Russia, together with other CIS nations, was now engaged in  a peacekeeping operation in Tajikistan, "the purpose of which is  to check the expansion of instability in this important region,  which is close to China, too". Kozyrev expressed the hope that  Russia would get more "comprehensive assistance" from the United  Nations, the CSCE, and other international organisations. "This  would be a better solution than the groundless statements on  Russian neo-imperialism, made from time to time in the West,"  the minister stressed.    The two states, as permanent members of the U.N. Security  Council, are also called upon to help solve the problem of  nuclear weapon on the Korean peninsula on the basis of  guarantees from the International Atomic Energy Agency," the  minister added.    Turning to economic cooperation with China, Kozyrev called  for its "qualitative development". He exressed Russia's  readiness to take part in large-scale projects on the territory  of China, including the construction of the world's largest  "three gorges" hydraulic power coplex and in the modernisation  of Chinese plants, built with the help of the former Soviet  Union.    "It is absurd for Russia to counterpoise the 'Western'  European and 'Eastern' Asian directions of its foreign policy.  China has always been and will remain a reliable and good  partner in the system of Russian global interests," Kozyrev  stressed.</p>

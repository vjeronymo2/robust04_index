If Turkish soldiers were sent to Bosnia the Serb political  leadership would not be able to control the reaction of the Serb  people, Plavsic said, and added that the Serbs in Bosnia were  not defending just their own thing but also the Orthodox faith  and Byzantine civilization.    Evangelos Venizelos, representative of the Greek Government,  reiterated the Greek Government's position that no Balkan  country should be involved in the war in Bosnia, MPA says.    The agency recalls a statement by Greek Foreign Minister  Karolos Papoulias that Greece would consider sending its own  Blue Helmets to Bosnia if the UN secretary general accepted the  participation of Turkish peacekeeping forces in the peacekeeping  operation in Bosnia.</p>

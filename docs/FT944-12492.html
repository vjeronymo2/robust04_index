			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: Alarm bells ring over Telebras tariffs - Brazil has returned to interventionism The Brazilian government's recent decision to cut telephone rates for local, long distance and international calls set alarm bells ringing. Not only was there investor concern about the effect on the profits of Telebras, Brazil's most traded stock, but more importantly the government seemed to be returning to its interventionist ways. The government, however, insists it is committed to tariff reform. The rate cuts were spurred by competition from the so-called US call-back companies, which charge much cheaper rates for international calls by channelling them through the US, and by political expediency. Mr Jonathan Morris, an analyst at Latinvest Securities in London, says that, after announcing a more pragmatic tariff policy at the end of 1992, 'this looks like the government is returning to the bad old days of political intervention in tariffs'. Analysts maintained that the move has failed to reform an artificial structure in which cheap local calls and standing charges are subsidised by an expensive long distance and international service. As for Telebras, , the government-controlled phone company, the effect on its revenues is hard to gauge. Estimates range from neutral to a fall in revenues of up to Dollars 200m next year. The uncertainty led Telebras's share price to fall sharply after the announcement. The reductions, which come into effect today, involve a 5 per cent cut in local rates, a 17 to 20 per cent reduction in international tariffs and higher discounts for off-peak national long distance calls. The cut in local rates, which are among the lowest in the world, is regarded by the market as a populist measure by President Itamar Franco and an attempt to try to keep down prices as part of a government anti-inflation plan. The price cuts for international calls, which make up 10 to 12 per cent of Telebras's revenues, are a reaction to the 'call-back' companies. Telebras says the reductions, which follow price cuts of 41 per cent since August last year, make Brazil's international rates comparable with those of overseas phone companies. However, call-back companies say their prices are still significantly cheaper than those of Telebras. For example, the call-back companies charge Dollars 1 to Dollars 1.50 per minute to most European countries while, after the reductions, Telebras will charge Dollars 2.35. Mr Marcelo Vainstein, an analyst at Baring Securities in Sao Paulo, estimates the cuts in local and international rates will lead to a fall in revenues of nearly Dollars 100m next year. Increased discounts for national long-distance calls, which make up half the company's revenues, could mean another Dollars 100m in lost revenues. But he says it is difficult to predict the effect on the national long-distance market because of a lack of information on the proportion of calls made during off-peak hours. In total, the price reductions could mean a fall of perhaps Dollars 80m in Telebras's expected after-tax profits of around Dollars 600m next year on revenues of some Dollars 6bn, he says. This loss could be partly offset by increased volume but analysts' most optimistic view is that the price reductions will have a neutral impact on revenues. They say Telebras's international calls are still comparatively expensive and long distance traffic is largely made up of business users, whose tariffs have not been reduced. For Telebras's future financial health an overhaul of the tariff structure is essential. The government has only partly implemented a restructuring announced in December 1992 under which the cross subsidy of local service by long distance and international rates was due to be phased out. In addition, the government has not implemented the decision to increase charges for basic services: Telebras's monthly standing charge is 44 cents, compared with Dollars 4 in Mexico and Dollars 5.50 in Chile. The effect of this tariff structure is that Telebras's revenues per line are less than Dollars 500, compared with about Dollars 800 for Telefonica de Argentina and Dollars 1,000 for Telmex. The lack of revenues puts pressure on Telebras's capital investment, which stand at about Dollars 3bn a year, half what is needed to cope with demand for lines, given that waiting times are up to two years. But Mr Renato Guerreiro, head of the government's phone tariffs department, says the government was still committed to the tariff reform, which was suspended in July when Brazil's new Real currency was launched. He maintained the the government was 'waiting for the right moment politically'. But Mr Guerreiro said regardless of when the reform takes place, international calls would fall further because Telebras's rates were still higher than call-back companies. In the longer term, most analysts expect tariff reform to be carried out following the election this month of Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who has said he favours liberalisation of the government's telecom monopoly. The recent tariff cuts, however, will not please investors in Telebras, says Mr Morris of Latinvest. 'It appears that while investors have been expecting a more pragmatic approach to telecommunications in Brazil the government is busy paddling in the opposite direction.'</p>

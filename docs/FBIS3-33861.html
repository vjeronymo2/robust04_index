Our  correspondent reports.    [Unidentified correspondent] Today's Majles open session and  the continuing debate on the bill for next year's national  budget were addressed initially by Rouqani Zanjani, the head of  the plan and budget organization.    Emphasizing the need to reduce the country's budget  dependency on oil income and to move toward other sources of  income, he said: In drawing up next year's budget, the  government has tried to provide for the greater part of the  country's expenditure through tax incomes and to allocate oil  income for development projects.    Pointing out that the income obtained from the increase in  fuel and energy prices must be used for oil related development  projects, he stressed: If Note 25 of the budget bill is dropped  the projects will come to a stop.    Zanjani described the increase in fuel and energy prices to  be within the context of implementing social justice and said:  One of the reasons that progress is not taking place in  industry and technology, in particular the production of  vehicles, is the availability of cheap fuel in the country.    The head of the plan and budget organization also said that  the reduction in the budget's income ceiling was the cause for  the stoppage of a number of development projects in the country  and reminded the deputies that: In drawing up next year's  national budget, the government has set aside many of the  projects and has reduced the number of national development  projects in comparison to projects in provinces.    The oil minister also addressed the session on Note 25 of  the  budget bill, which concerns the increase in fuel and energy  prices.    He said: We are presently paying a 11,000 billion rial fuel  subsidy and if this process continues and we fail to find a  solution, we will have more problems in the next development  plan.    Speaking on the need to end the increase in fuel  consumption,  he said: In the second development plan we have looked into all  possible solutions that could end consumption growth and we  welcome any other solution that might reduce consumption.    Referring to the view of the Majles joint commission -- on  plan and budget, economic and financial affairs and cooperatives  -- regarding the adjustment of fuel and energy prices, he said:  If the commission's suggestion is approved we will have to set  aside some 700 billion rials of development projects in the oil  industry.    He then referred to the negative effects of setting aside  these projects.    [Announcer] In the continuation of the Majles open session,  Energy Minister Bijan Namdar-Zangeneh pointed out that the  average monthly income for home consumers is 180 kilowatts [kw],  but two thirds use less than 180 kw.    According to a commission decision, the price increase will  not effect consumption up to 500 kw, and 96.6 percent of  consumers will not be effected; furthermore the price increase  does not effect agricultural usage or 99 percent of hot regions,  he said.    He clarified that the electric energy price increase will  effect less than one percent of the industry.    Stating that an annual 2.1 trillion rial subsidy is being  paid for electricity, the energy minister said: Social justice  does not demand payment of such subsidies or more subsidy for  bigger consumers.    Zangeneh said the proposed increase in electricity rates  would be spent on implementing projects for the oil industry and  reminded the deputies that otherwise, many of the projects that  are sources of employment will come to a stop.    In today's open session, Mohammad Gharazi, the minister for  post, telegraph, and telephone also spoke about the increase in  the volume of activity in post and communications as well as  improvement in service provided for the public.    He said: You can rest assured that people will pay if you  provide the various services for them. The country is an arena  for development and people want progress. He emphasized:  Movement must be such as to allow a change from subsidizing to  permanent investment.    The report by our correspondent indicates that following the  10-hour period allocated for speeches by deputies for and  against, as well as explanations given by the joint commission  and government representatives on the principles of next year's  national budget bill, voting was held and the bill was approved  in principle.    As required by Majles regulations following the approval of  the bill in principle, the review of proposals by Majles  commissions and deputies regarding the budget incomes started.    Today's open Majles session had a break at noon and  deliberations on the proposals followed after the restart at  1400.</p>

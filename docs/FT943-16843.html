			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Bosnian embargo backed: Senate votes 50:50 to keep arms ban President Bill Clinton yesterday narrowly avoided the prospect of a big clash between the US and its European allies when the US Senate defeated by a hair's breadth a measure requiring the administration unilaterally to lift the embargo on arms supplies to Bosnia. A motion sponsored by Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader received a 50:50 vote. A tied vote is a defeat in the Senate. The House of Representatives has already voted by 244 to 178 for the same measure and, if Mr Dole's motion had passed, Mr Clinton would have faced an embarrassing choice between vetoing the entire defence budget, to which the Bosnian motion was attached as an amendment, or defying the United Nations resolution which bans arms supplies to the former Yugoslavia. Mr Clinton has said that he supports ending the embargo on Bosnia, but not unilaterally. France and the UK, which have warned that a lifting of the embargo could compel them to withdraw their troops from the UN peacekeeping force in Bosnia, were pleased at the outcome of the Senate vote. Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, had lobbied 19 senators on a recent trip to Washington in an effort to solidify opposition to any unilateral move. While Senator Dole argued that it was wrong to deprive Bosnia, which has been much harder hit than Serbia by the arms embargo, of the right to defend itself, Senator Sam Nunn and Senator John Warner, two of the Senate's most respected voices on national security affairs, warned that the US would be dragged into the conflict if it breached the UN embargo. 'The implication of lifting this embargo unilaterally is that this becomes America's war. Lifting this unilaterally carries with it a very serious moral obligation to follow through,' Mr Nunn said.</p>

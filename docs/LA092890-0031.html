			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: UNION BANK CHIEF TO RESIGN NEXT MONTH  </P> <P> Seishichi Itoh, who headed the Bank of Tokyo's 1988 acquisition of Union Bank  for $737 million through its California First Bank subsidiary, will resign next  month as Union Bank's chief executive.  </P> <P> Itoh, 55, will leave the San Francisco bank to return to Japan to take an  unspecified assignment with Bank of Tokyo.  </P> <P> His leaving is no surprise, and in line with the Japanese management style in  which top executives are rotated every few years.  </P> <P> Taisuke Shimizu, 54, the bank's vice chairman and chief financial officer, will  replace Itoh. Shimizu's position will be filled by Kanetaka Yoshida, 52.  </P> <P> Union, the state's fifth-largest commercial bank, is 77% owned by Bank of  Tokyo. The bank today is an outgrowth of the combination of the former Union  Bank in Los Angeles and California First Bank in San Francisco, which Itoh had  headed since 1983.  </P></p>

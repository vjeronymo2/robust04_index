			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Legal battle over Aids drug widens Lawyers acting for the widow of a British Aids victim said yesterday they had widened the legal battle over the claimed toxic effects of AZT, the most widely prescribed anti-Aids drug. They are extending their case against Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals company, to include a US government agency. Mrs Susan Threakall claims her haemophiliac husband's death was caused by the drug AZT and not by Aids, solicitor Mr Graham Ross said. She says her husband was given AZT only because of unjustified claims made for the drug by Wellcome and the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Her case against Wellcome was announced earlier this month. The company said it would defend the case vigorously.</p>

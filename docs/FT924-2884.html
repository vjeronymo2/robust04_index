			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Greenalls steady at Pounds 64.4m 'in a harsh climate' THE GREENALLS Group, continuing its transformation from regional brewer to national retailer and hotelier with a Pounds 108m capital spending programme, achieved a marginal increase in annual pre-tax profits from Pounds 64.1m to Pounds 64.4m. The result - in line with market expectations - showed 'resilience . . . in response to the harsh economic climate,' said Mr Andrew Thomas, chairman and chief executive. He said the Pounds 86m raised from a rights issue in October would enable further 'careful and cautious' expansion. Basic earnings per share for the year to September 25, excluding property profits, rose 7 per cent to 29.6p. A final dividend of 6.93p raises the total by 7 per cent to 11.77p. Group operating profit of Pounds 77.4m was 6 per cent higher on turnover 8.5 per cent ahead at Pounds 529.1m. But the surplus on property disposals declined from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 7.21m. There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 14.9m relating to the write-down in value of the group's US hotels. Pub profits, helped by rigorous cost controls and the acquisition of 39 outlets, increased by 6.1 per cent to Pounds 47.51m. Turnover was 6 per cent ahead at Pounds 185.9m. Beer volumes were down 5.2 per cent but food sales increased from 5.8 per cent to 7.1 per cent of turnover. Investment in upgrading and expanding the estate, which now stretches from the group's north-west base into the northern Home Counties, totalled Pounds 30m. Premier House, the catering inns and restaurants division, achieved profits growth of 31 per cent to Pounds 8.4m on turnover up from Pounds 39.5m to Pounds 43m. Spending on development of the outlets for the family market amounted to Pounds 16m. Operating profits from UK hotels fell 9 per cent to Pounds 14.2m. Occupancy rates were maintained at 60 per cent, helped by an improvement in the second half, but room rates declined 7.6 per cent to Pounds 48. Losses of the US hotels were reduced from Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 400,000. Off-licences, with an eight-month contribution from the Blayneys acquisition, maintained margins at 18 per cent while improving profits from Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 4.5m. Drinks and services' profits were marginally lower at Pounds 6.2m (Pounds 6.4m) but rationalisation and an agreement with Del Monte for the production and distribution of fruit-based soft drinks should improve profitability this year. COMMENT Greenalls has so far shown a shrewd eye for a bargain, picking up some good hotel and pub assets from the receiver as it expands its operations nationally. That provides a measure of reassurance for the market as it continues its heavy spending programme with a budgeted Pounds 88m this year. The Pounds 86m rights issue has strengthened the balance sheet, reducing gearing from 27 per cent to 15 per cent. Internal cash flow should cover the maintenance of existing businesses, leaving the group with about Pounds 100m to spend on further acquisitions over the next three years without exceeding its self-imposed gearing ceiling of 30 per cent. Analysts expect pre-tax profits of about Pounds 67m this year, putting it on a prospective p/e of 12.6. The stock could be under-valued.</p>

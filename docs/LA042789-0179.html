			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CASA TERESA SUPPORTERS GO WESTERN  </P> <P> It ain't broke, so they don't fix it.  </P> <P> As they have for the past three years, the Guilds of Casa Teresa rustled up  some 300 supporters at $75 a pop for a Western-themed fund-raiser Saturday in  South Coast Plaza's Jewel Court.  </P> <P> This year's "Casino de Casa" benefit netted an estimated $30,000 for the  privately funded Orange facility, which provides temporary shelter and  counseling for pregnant single women between the ages of 18 and 25. Casa Teresa  can accommodate 20 young women at a time, according to program coordinator  Sister Ellen, and is "always full, always has a waiting list," she said.  </P> <P> Guests arrived at the shopping mall dressed in jeans and Stetsons, skirts and  boots, bandannas and big-buckled belts.  </P> <P> After checking in beside a stand of giant cacti, they moseyed along a line of  silent auction tables, noshing spicy beef empanitas, barbecued  chicken-on-a-stick and corn muffins stuffed with smoked turkey. Cowpokes never  had it so good.  </P> <P> Then it was down the escalator (ride 'em!) to the gaming tables, the bandstand  and much-ignored dance floor, and buffet tables loaded with Southwesternish  standards (taco fixings, chiles rellenos, baby back ribs) and innovations  (tequila lime-cured gravad lax of salmon, for instance).  </P> <P> Among the first and the evening's few dancers were Ken and Dianne Schautschick  of Fountain Valley, in-laws of event chairwoman Merrill Plou.  </P> <P> Also seen Texas two-stepping were Lynne and Peter Tremble, who accessorized  their duds with playing cards tucked into their belts and pockets and hatbands.  Peter also sported dice cuff links and dress studs, a shark's tooth dangling on  his gold watch chain and an ace in his vest pocket.  </P> <P> Doug Hand bellied up to a blackjack table with a .357 Magnum holstered on his  hip "for quick draw," he said, setting his (cartridge-less) weapon on the table  by his cards.  </P> <P> Where another man might wear a gun, Rich Goodman sported a red bandanna. "I got  shot in the leg coming in," he said, joking about the kerchief tied around his  thigh.  </P> <P> Goodman, president of the Orange County chapter of the American Jewish  Committee, called himself "pro-choice" in matters of childbirth and abortion.  But he said he supports the mission of Casa Teresa to assist young, often  homeless mothers who have chosen to carry their babies to term.  </P> <P> "As a pro-choice person, I believe that one of the choices should be having  children," he said.  </P></p>

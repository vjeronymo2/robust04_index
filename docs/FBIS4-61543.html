			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Reports by </F> Diplomatic Correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and  others]    [Text] Press secretary Levon Zurabyan of Armenian President  Levon Ter-Petrosyan told INTERFAX that Baku's refusal to  negotiate a ceasefire on the line of confrontation between the  Karabakh and Azeri forces proved that Baku's stand on  Nagorno-Karabakh was short-sighted and that Baku still hoped to  resolve the Karabakh problem by force. Zurabyan said Baku  rejected all suggestions and initiatives for a settlement, as  well as mediation by the Conference on Security and Cooperation  in Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States and Russia.  In Zurabyan's view, its own policies led Baku up a blind alley.    Zurabyan felt the key to the solution of the Karabakh  problem  lay in Baku because Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh had repeatedly  declared their willingness to negotiate an enduring ceasefire  accommodation. IF Note: On Thursday the Azeri delegation to a  two-day conference on Nagorno-Karabakh, held in Bishkek, refused  to sign a protocol with a call for the introduction of a  cease-fire as of 0000 on 9 May. The other participants in the  two-day negotiations -- Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh, Russia and  Kyrgyzstan -- signed the protocol. Baku rejects the document  that makes no mention of the Armenian occupation of part of  Azerbaijan and allows for the creation and introduction of a  Commonwealth peacekeeping contingent in the disputed area. In  addition, Baku suggested that the protocol, signed by  Nagorno-Karabakh as a whole, must also be signed by Karabakh's  Azeri community. The suggestion was rejected.    Chairmen Babken Ararktsyan and Karen Baburyan of the  Armenian  and Karabakh parliaments told their Kyrgyz counterpart Medetkhan  Sherimkulov in Bishkek Friday that on return to their home  places they would work for a cease-fire in the zone of the  Armenian-Azeri conflict.    Sherimkulov, who chairs the Karabakh peacekeeping group of  the Commonwealth's Interparliamentary Assembly, sees what  Ararktsyan and Baburyan told him as response to his request for  the unilateral introduction of a ceasefire at 0000 on 9 May.  Sherimkulov intends to address Baku with a similar request.    Ararktsyan praised the results of the Bishkek conference and  told INTERFAX that the Armenians would take unilateral action to  implement the Bishkek protocol. He hoped Baku would realize the  impossibility of resolving the conflict by force.</p>

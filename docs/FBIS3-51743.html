			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, 16 Jan (PL) -- The Cuban weekly newspaper  JUVENTUD REBELDE published an article today stating that even  though the United States fails to grant more than half of the  20,000 yearly visas agreed to in 1984, the U.S. media always  blame Cuba for illegal departures.    More than 60 percent of the visa applications rejected by  the  U.S. Interests Section in Havana are submitted by youths, who  also make up the majority of illegal departures from Cuba, the  newspaper states.    Because of this, the newspaper adds, the only option left is  to risk their lives crossing the sea in fragile crafts to reach  the United States and then be accepted without hesitation, as  opposed to the treatment Haitians, Mexicans, or Chinese receive.    Under the title "U.S. Visa: Preferably Dead," the newspaper  makes an analysis of Cuban migration to the United States from  the last century to the present and highlights some of the main  causes, such as economic crises, wars, and the resulting family  reunifications.    According to Rafael Hernandez, a political analyst and  university professor, quoted by JUVENTUD REBELDE, "the largest  migratory wave -- more than 250,000 people -- left Cuba between  1965-1973, during the years with the greatest economic  difficulty and their main motivation was generalized shortages."    Something similar, the newspaper adds, is happening lately,  although Cuban immigrants find themselves forced to state that  they "go in search of liberty" or are "fleeing a totalitarian  regime."    As far as Cuban diplomat Ariel Ricardo is concerned, the  situation of his fellow citizens has an ideological connotation  that makes them different from Haitians, Mexicans, or other  Latin immigrants and added that the idea is to try to show that  they "are fleeing from the Castro-communist dictatorship," which  is not true in most cases.    Ricardo stated that one example is trumpet player Arturo  Sandoval, who when replying to the question whether he would  return to Cuba if communism was overthrown, said: "You are  silly. Do you think I want to live in a Third World country?"    JUVENTUD REBELDE disclosed that the U.S. intention of giving  a political tint to all immigration from Cuba was recently  questioned by Manolo Salgado, a reporter for the U.S. newspaper  EL NUEVO HERALD.    "Our Cuban brothers do not expect or demand that we take  from  here the redeeming torch of liberty. They are satisfied with  food, medicines, clothing, shoes, and what is most important at  this moment: dollars," Salgado stated, according to JUVENTUD  REBELDE.</p>

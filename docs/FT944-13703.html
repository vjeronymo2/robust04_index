			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei ends lower ahead of Japan Tobacco listing Worries over the higher yen and tomorrow's listing of Japan Tobacco eroded investor confidence and share prices lost ground for the third consecutive day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 index fell 120.22 to close at the day's low of 19,732.15, after opening at a high of 19,831.87. The market was hit by arbitrage selling and position closing by dealers ahead of the last trading day for October settlement today. Buying by financial institutions failed to counter heavy selling and the index fell just before the close. Volume was 219m shares against 181m. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 6.79 to 1,568.40 and the Nikkei 300 fell 1.18 to 286.82. Declines led advances by 632 to 301, with 240 issues unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose to 0.21 to 1,288.18. An official announcement by the Finance Ministry that it would not unload the unsold Japan Tobacco shares until next fiscal year failed to encourage investors. Some market participants were worried that institutional investors who had bought the stocks at the auction prior to the public offering could sell their holdings. The rise in the yen to the Y96 level hurt export oriented stocks. Fujitsu fell Y10 to Y1,070 and Toshiba declined Y12 to Y751. Car makers were also lower with Nissan Motor down Y18 to Y828 and Honda Motor losing Y30 at Y1,700. However, Matsushita Electric Industrial rose Y20 to Y1,600 after it announced that its interim pre-tax profits had risen by 26 per cent and revised up its full year forecast. Sega Enterprises, the video game maker, snapped out of its eight day losing streak, and rose Y380 to Y4,830 on bargain hunting, while Nintendo added Y120 to Y5,170. Tsumura, the drug maker, put on Y80 to Y1,200. Steels and heavy industry stocks were actively traded. Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, rose Y2 to Y390 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries added Y2 to Y766. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 79.36 to 22,017.55 in volume of 44.4m shares. Roundup The overnight fall on Wall Street brought early weakness to the region, but some markets recovered later. Taiwan was closed for a holiday. HONG KONG lost 1.25 per cent in low volume, with futures-linked trading adding a further disincentive. The Hang Seng index fell 117.79 to 9,246.50 in turnover of HKDollars 2.3bn. October Hang Seng futures declined 170 to 9,220 on 21,000 contracts ahead of their expiration this Friday. Hanny Magnetics, a manufacturer of video cassettes and floppy disks, gained 12 cents to HKDollars 1.05 amid speculation that Hutchison Whampoa would purchase additional stock to maintain its stake in the group. Hutchison fell 60 cents to HKDollars 34. SEOUL staged a rebound in blue chips, but brokers said that they expected the rise to be short-lived as the composite stock index added 9.87 to 1,091.02. Both Goldstar and Yukong went limit up, gaining Won1,300 and Won1,600 to close at Won31,700 and Won44,400 respectively. Brokers said that tax payments due next week, amounting to some Won4,000bn, and fears of intervention by the Korea Stock Market Stablisation Fund would limit further rises. Last week the fund sold Won100bn worth of stocks in an attempt to cool the market which had reached an historic high on October 18 of 1,127. KUALA LUMPUR's composite index ended down 6.84 at 1,102.23 after hitting a low of 1,099.79. Trading remained subdued with volume reaching 196m shares. Acidchem led the day's activity with the shares rising 50 cents to MDollars 8.40 in volume of 8.2m shares. The company last Friday announced the acquisition of the Penang bridge concession and a stake in the toll operator, Metacorp. SINGAPORE retreated on foreign investor-led selling of blue chips in light trading, with many buyers sidelined. The Straits Times Industrial index fell 14.32 to 2,362.54, in volume of 155m shares. Among the main losers Cycle and Carriage lost 30 cents to SDollars 13.40, Keppel Corp 20 cents to SDollars 12.90 and Fraser and Neave 10 cents to SDollars 17.20. BANGKOK gave up 1.4 per cent in acknowledgment of negative sentiment in the region, with the banking sector particularly badly hit. The SET index lost 20.90 at 1,501.58, most of its losses coming in morning trade. Turnover was moderate at Bt6.9bn. Brokers said that foreign institutions were behind most of the selling. The banks were sold heavily after recent gains, with the sub-index losing nearly 2 per cent in turnover of Bt1.6bn. Krung Thai Bank was down Bt2 at Bt86. SYDNEY followed overseas markets down but it was also disturbed by sales of futures as the All Ordinaries index fell 15.6 to 2,021.8 in turnover of ADollars 431.9m.

Petron fell 1.9 per cent to 25.50 pesos, Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co dipped by 2 per cent to 1,450 pesos and San Miguel B dropped 1.45 per cent to 136. BOMBAY extended its gains to a a third consecutive day; volumes remained low, but brokers said that sentiment was much improved as the BSE 30-share rose 27.21 to 4,355.58. The brokers said that the recovery was mainly due to selective buying by Indian mutual funds and local investors. KARACHI was dominated by bearish sentiment as the KSE 100 index fell 28.55, or 1.25 per cent to 2,249.68; traders talked of a liquidity crunch, with investors' money diverted to new issues. COLOMBO came back to a fall of 2.85 per cent, on political uncertainty following a day's curfew imposed after the assassination of the opposition leader Mr Gamini Dissanayake. The all share index fell 31.74 to 1,081.27 and turnover from Rs175.99m to Rs59.21m.</p>

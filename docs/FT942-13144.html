			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (3): Farewell to antiquated operations - Business process re-engineering is the restructuring of a company and the way it operates / Business process re-engineering The emphasis in business process re-engineering - or BPR for short - shifts from traditional functions such as accounting and purchasing, working in their own compartments, to processes, which typically cut across functions. People from different areas communicate with each other and even work together as teams. Layers of management usually disappear. Indeed, BPR has cynically been defined as Big Personnel Reductions, often Based on Professional Recommendation, a reference to the number of companies now offering help in this area. The impact of such change is typically reflected in greater innovation in everything from products to the use of information technology, better quality and service and better staff motivation. Bending the corporate and individual mind to such an exercise is no mean feat. And although information technology has a key role to play, it is also part of the initial problem. 'Business process re-engineering is going off the rails, even before it is properly understood,' says Dr Colin Coulson-Thomas, chairman of consultancy Adaptation and leader of a new European Union project in this field. 'People are getting bogged down with incremental improvements to what is, rather than thinking creatively about what ought to be. 'What is referred to as BPR turns out to be process improvement or simplification and not process re-engineering. 'Such initiatives may result in worthwhile increases in performance but they are unlikely to produce the radical transformation promised by advocates of re-engineering.' Mr David Harvey, a director of research firm Business Intelligence, which has studied this topic, adds: 'Most businesses claim they are geared to constant change. But too often the change is the wrong kind - the kind that props up a creaking management process or functional structure and keeps it going for a few more years, rather than replacing it with systems which are suited to current needs. The result is management systems of growing complexity and overhead costs.' He adds that 'information technology has been part of the problem: as administrative systems have grown in complexity, IT has been used to help manage that complexity.' Mr Colin Philips agrees and believes that the automation of existing processes and functions, often dating back to the Industrial Revolution, demands that companies get started as soon as possible. Mr Philips is head of international operations at Trinzic, one of the growing number of companies offering software products to support the analysis and development of business processes. The urgency is increased because as end-users' appreciation of the potential of information technology increases, they are demanding more and more systems which are tightly focused on their activities. 'As information technology becomes tightly integrated into the organisation's different business units, it becomes difficult to separate the business processes from the technology itself,' Mr Philips says. 'And as business processes become more automated, they become embedded in the information system. It becomes increasingly difficult to change one without changing the other.' The Business Intelligence study report highlights the restrictions of traditional structures. Each department focuses on what it contributes, not on what is needed as a whole. There is competition between functions, for example for budgets and staff. Employees identify with their function rather than with the company as a whole. There are barriers to co-operation between functions and sometimes even conflict. And a structure based on functions generates its own bureaucracy, which is needed to co-ordinate work and the flow of documents between the functions. 'Re-engineering challenges the underlying values and culture of a company,' the report says. 'All the components of a company could be affected, because re-engineering takes a holistic approach. Everything that affects outcomes - organisation, processes, people, technologies - must be considered for change.' Although information technology is seen as an obstacle to getting started, it is also regarded as key to the re-engineered business. At the simplest level, information technology enables different departments to share information through on-line databases, breaking down barriers and jealously guarded departmental ownership of data. Work flow automation, typically based on systems that process images of incoming documents such as forms and invoices, enable people to work together more easily. So-called groupware software enables people in different departments, perhaps even in different cities, to access, contribute to and comment on shared documents such as specifications and sales proposals. Electronic data interchange, the exchange of orders, invoices and sales forecasts between computers, is re-engineering business processes beyond the company gates by transforming relationships with external trading partners. Thinking about areas such as these can be a starting point for looking at business re-engineering, but only a start. As US consultant Dr Michael Hammer put it, when he introduced the term to management: 'Re-engineering cannot be planned meticulously or accomplished in small and cautious steps. It's an all-or-nothing proposition with an uncertain result.' He added: 'Even so, most companies have no choice but to muster the courage to do it. For many, re-engineering is the only hope for breaking away from antiquated processes that threaten to drag them down.'</p>

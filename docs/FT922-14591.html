			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Management: Learning the lesson of ABC British companies which rushed to embrace supposedly solve-it-all accountancy systems, like activity-based costing (ABC) in the late 1980s, have jettisoned all pretence at using them in the recession. So say Bob Sweeting, of the School of Management at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (Umist) and Roy Davies, of the accountants Price Waterhouse. Two years ago, Sweeting and Davies studied management accounting methods among 700 businesses. They found wide confusion about ABC and how it was supposed to work. This was generally because companies had tried to graft new systems onto existing ones that were poorly structured in the first place. Sweeting and Davies have since followed up with a series of workshops around Britain for the companies they studied. The techniques were being sold hard by management consultants before the recession. 'But like all fashions and fads, they fall by the wayside in hard times and people revert to basics like immediate cash and stop thinking about the longer term,' Davis adds. Done properly, he says the methods are invaluable because they provide a complete view of the profitability of every corner of the business and the impact of each department on the costs of every other. Sweeting says the minority who have applied modern techniques correctly have a better view of the dynamics of their businesses and have been able to make better decisions about what they can afford to cut in the recession. The workshops showed that larger companies have kept investing in improving their accounting methods during the recession, while medium-sized or smaller ones have tended to let people go or drop their consultants. 'For many companies, developing ABC or similar techniques is seen as discretionary spending. It is one of the first things to go,' Davies says. But installed properly, rather than bolted on as a panacea for already muddled score-keeping, the process becomes self-financing, he says.</p>

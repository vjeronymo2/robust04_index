			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Milosevic pressed over UN sanctions THE international mediators on Bosnia, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, flew to Belgrade yesterday in an attempt to persuade Serbia's president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, to lift his objections to posting UN monitors along Serbia's border with Bosnia. Serbia claims its authorities are enforcing sanctions against Bosnia following the Bosnian Serbs' rejection last month of the Vance/Owen peace plan. However, fuel and other supplies are continuing to cross the border. As UN sanctions bite more deeply Mr Milosevic may be more willing to have international monitors posted along the Serbian side of the river Drina that marks the border. The dismissal last week of Mr Dobrica Cosic, the federal president and an opponent of monitors, removes an important obstacle to the proposal. Lord Owen also stressed that the Vance-Owen plan remained 'the framework for a settlement,' adding that the creation of six safe areas for Moslems was only a 'short-term solution, to stop Bosnian Serb attacks on areas that are clearly and unequivocally Moslem or Croat'. However, his admission that he had failed to convince Bosnian Serb leaders to allow UN observers and relief convoys into Gorazde, one of three UN-designated safe areas in eastern Bosnia, underlines the problems involved in trying to set up safe areas without a ceasefire in effect. Gorazde, an industrial town close to the border with Serbia, has come under heavy artillery attack by Bosnian Serb forces in the past two weeks. Its population doubled to 70,000 with the arrival of Moslems from surrounding villages. Earlier this week, the town's last supply route was cut as Serb forces closed in. 'It's clear the Bosnian Serbs intend to consolidate their territorial gains by squeezing the safe areas in eastern Bosnia out of existence,' a western diplomat said. Serbian commanders have prevented UN relief convoys from reaching Srebenica, another safe area in eastern Bosnia, where 300 UN troops are responsible for protecting more than 20,000 Moslems. Bosnian radio reported that Ukrainian soldiers serving in the UN protection force yesterday fired on unidentified armed groups trying to reach Zepa, the third safe area, a small town in a mountain ravine where 16,000 Moslems have sought refuge. The future of the other three safe areas may be decided by the outcome of a new Moslem offensive against Croatians in central Bosnia, aimed at tightening control over areas with a mainly Moslem population. Moslem forces this week captured Travnik, strategically placed between two Moslem-controlled strongholds, also burning surrounding villages. After Sarajevo, the largest safe area would be Tuzla, an industrial centre with 340,000 residents, where there has been little fighting. One reason is that both Serbs and Moslems fear provoking massive destruction if a chemical factory in the city was shelled. The Bihac district, a mainly agricultural area with 200,000 residents, has also remained relatively quiet with UN convoys facing few problems in getting through.</p>

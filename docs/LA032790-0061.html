			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DUMARS SIDELINED FOR AT LEAST 4 WEEKS  </P> <P> Guard Joe Dumars of the Detroit Pistons will miss at least four weeks after  breaking the same hand he broke last year, the team said Monday.  </P> <P> Dumars, averaging a career-best 18.4 points per game, suffered a fracture of  the third metacarpal bone in his left hand when he tried to break a fall during  Saturday's 105-98 loss at San Antonio.  </P> <P> "When it first happened, I thought, 'Oh my God!' It was the same area of the  hand that I hurt last year," Dumars said. "I can't even hold this piece of  paper in this hand -- it's too heavy."  </P> <P> Dumars, 26, is in his fifth year in the league. He was a member of the NBA  Eastern Conference All-Stars last month and was most valuable player of last  year's NBA Finals, which the Pistons won in four games over the Lakers.  </P> <P> The Pistons haven't decided who will replace Dumars on the roster, Piston  spokesman Matt Dobek said.  </P></p>

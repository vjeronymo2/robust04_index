			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POSTSCRIPT: LATINO WORKERS DRIFT BACK TO SITE THAT DREW COMPLAINTS  </P> <P> Last month, the city of Laguna Beach opened an outdoor hiring hall on a remote  stretch of Laguna Canyon Road in hopes of luring Latino dayworkers away from a  Coast Highway convenience store, where they drew complaints.  </P> <P> Initially, the plan worked. But now some of the dayworkers have drifted back to  their old haunt, complaining that the canyon is too cold. The Circle K store,  they say, is warm and has food and coffee. And, they say, it seems easier to  find jobs in town than out in the canyon.  </P> <P> "Little by little, we are returning," said Juan Diaz, 25, an immigrant from  Acapulco, Mexico.  </P> <P> The management at Circle K, however, is not so happy. Neither are some  residents, who fear the dozen or so workers milling near their homes each  morning will swell back to nearly 100, as was the situation before the city in  mid-December set up its hiring hall on a dirt parking lot along Laguna Canyon  Road.  </P> <P> "My heart goes out to them, but I can't take this," said Sydney Mack, a woman  who lives on nearby Chiquita Street. "I am considering moving from my home of  17 years."  </P> <P> Perminder Singh, the Circle K manager, said he has noticed a gradual increase  in the number of workers congregating outside his business on the corner of  North Coast Highway and Viejo Street.  </P> <P> "It was good for a couple of days, but now they are starting to come back,"  Singh said Thursday morning as 15 dayworkers mingled outside his store. At the  canyon pickup site, about 45 men waited for jobs at the same time Thursday.  </P> <P> "Nobody knows what to do now," Singh said.  </P> <P> City Manager Kenneth C. Frank acknowledged that the city's plan has not removed  all the day laborers from north Laguna Beach. But a spot check by city  employees last week found only six workers at the Circle K and 57 at the canyon  location, he said.  </P> <P> "I'm not saying it's perfect (but) we think it's been pretty darn successful,"  Frank said. "I mean, look at what's happening in Orange," where dayworkers  congregate on Chapman Avenue. "They've had raids, leaned on people and the  workers are right back."  </P> <P> The number of workers at the Circle K has been so reduced that they pose little  of the problem they did before, Frank said. Neighbors had complained that the  laborers' urinated and defecated in public, and Circle K management complained  that they harassed female customers and shoplifted.  </P> <P> Singh said those problems are returning.  </P> <P> "The ladies, especially, are scared to come in here," Singh said.  </P> <P> But workers outside Singh's store denied that they caused problems.  </P> <P> "We are here to work, that is all," said Pablo Martinez, 40, of Orange.  </P> <P> Martinez, who left a wife and 10 children in Mexico to find work in the United  States, said that he spent a few days at the Laguna Canyon job site but quickly  returned to the Coast Highway site.  </P> <P> "It is sunnier here earlier," Martinez said. "In the canyon it is very cold."  </P> <P> At the canyon site, where several workers wore scarfs over their faces to ward  off the 48-degree chill, Eutimio Mancilla, 26, of Acapulco, said through  chattering teeth, "It's too cold in this place. In this place it is cold every  morning."  </P> <P> It also draws fewer employers, the men say.  </P> <P> Outside the Circle K, Lino Quintana, 35, an immigrant from the Mexican state of  Guerrero, said patrones, American employers, stop there for coffee and  laborers.  </P> <P> Finally, some Latino workers said they feel safer from immigration raids at the  convenience store -- where they can scan approaching streets -- than in the  canyon, where Laguna Canyon Road curves quickly out of view. "Also there is no  place to hide (in the canyon)," Diaz said.  </P> <P> Frank said, however, that the exact opposite is true. A sweep through Laguna  Beach last week by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service concentrated  in the northern area, resulting in a few apprehensions of undocumented workers,  Frank said. But the INS left the new hiring hall location alone.  </P> <P> "The INS is cooperating to keep the pressure on north Laguna," Frank said.  </P></p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Low trading volume, narrow premiums and a trading range just short of 40 points added up to a volatile day for stock index futures, writes Jeffrey Brown. The FT-SE 100 December contract was 3,119 at the official 4.10pm close, up 10 points. The premium to the cash market was 10 points and fair value premium was just under 12 points. Trading volume was thin and traders described conditions as 'very squeezy all day'. The general quality of business was low, with most activity provided by the local, independent traders. For the most part the December contract did little more than drift, making scant attempt to provide cash equities with a lead. The day's low was 3,085, with the 3,121 peak occurring just before the close of pit trading. Volume was only 9,600 contracts, down from around 12,000 on Monday. The closure of the Matif, the French futures market, for All-Saint's Day was one of the more obvious reasons for the low level of activity. The resilience of the December contract in the face of the clear weakness on Wall Street - both US equities and bonds were trading sharply south when London closed - surprised many traders. The traded options market was significantly busier than on Monday, with 55,409 lots dealt against 31,215.</p>

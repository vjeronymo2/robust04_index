			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Letter: Accountability the essential feature of corporate well-being Sir, However much I disagree with Sir Owen Green's approach to corporate governance (Personal View, June 9) his contribution must be welcomed as a stimulant to the debate on this vital issue. Accountability is an essential feature of any corporate activity if it is to be effective and efficient. The inability of British businesses to compete with their counterparts in Germany and Japan since the Second World War is a consequence of the erosion of the accountability of the managers of the businesses to the shareholders. Accountability, according to the Companies Act, is vested in the authority of the annual general meeting of shareholders. Regrettably, this has been rendered ineffective by the automatic support of existing managements by the proxy votes of the institutions. Accordingly, managements have become self-perpetuating and fail to realise the full potential of the business. However, Sir Owen opposes even the limited strengthening of accountability as proposed by the Cadbury Committee. He regards the appointment of non-executive directors with responsibilities to monitor the interests of shareholders as being against the principles of a unitary board. He goes even further and challenges those who believe in a need to monitor the activities of the executive to have the courage of their convictions and advocate a two-tier board structure. On this point I find myself in full agreement with Sir Owen. Maurice Gillibrand, 7 Tal-y-Cae, Tregarth, Bangor, Gwynedd</p>

In an  interview to ITAR-TASS he said that the discussion of Boris  Yeltsin's message is put by deputies of the upper chamber of  parliament on the agenda of its third meeting that opened on  Thursday.    The main directions of the consolidation of the Russian  state  indicated by the president will undoubtedly have an effect on a  plan of legislative work that the chamber will endorse at its  current meeting, the speaker believes.    In an interview to ITAR-TASS, deputy of the State Duma,  Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin said that the presidential  message should be used as the guide for adjusting normal  mechanisms of market relations. Shokhin believes that the state  authorities are capable of doing so.    The problem of Russians who constitute the absolute majority  of the population, 83 per cent, has been raised for the first  time in the presidential message. Commenting on this section of  the message, Russian Minister for Nationalities and Regional  Policy Sergey Shakhray told ITAR-TASS that "all politicians  should be constantly aware that there is direct relationship  between a sense of well-being of the Russian people and that of  all other peoples in the federation".    Shakhray said that the forming of the Russian nation should  not be in the imperial spirit, at the expense of the interests  of other peoples. The Russian state is a form of  self-determination of all its ethnic groups with guarantees of  the development of each of them.    Regarding Russians' positions in former union republics,  Shakhray said that Russia has juridical obligations to them,  also under international law. As the successor of the USSR,  Russia must protect citizens under its jurisdiction who live  outside Russian boundaries.    Tatarstan's President Mintimer Shaymiyev believes that  virtually every deputy went along with the Russian president's  message to the Federal Assembly. It is now essential to embark  on its implementation and to continue the economic reforms, he  told ITAR-TASS on Thursday.    Tatarstan's president supported the Russian president's  attitude that decentralisation of russian economy is needed. He  believes that important economic matters should be tackled  locally.</p>

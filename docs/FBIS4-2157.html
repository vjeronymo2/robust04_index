			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 7 Apr (XINHUA) -- Foreign Ministry  Spokesman Wu Jianmin said here today the maintenance of  relaxation and stability of the Korean Peninsula conforms to the  common interests of both the Korean people and all other parties  concerned. "We oppose any action harmful to the relaxation and  stability in the Korean Peninsula, be it military exercises or  deployment of missiles."    He said: It is necessary to refrain from taking actions that  will sharpen the contradictions, especially under the current  circumstances.    He made the statement at a news briefing this afternoon when  asked by reporters to comment on the fact that the United States  has begun shipping "Patriot" missiles to the Republic of Korea  [ROK] and that the United States and the ROK are planning to  resume their Team Spirit joint military exercises.    In response to a reporter's question on the nuclear issue  involving the Democratic People's Republic of Korea [DPRK], he  reiterated that China has all along maintained that the DPRK's  nuclear issue should be settled through dialogue. All parties  concerned have expressed the willingness to settle the issue  through continued dialogue.</p>

			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / International Company News: UAP increases 20% at halfway UNION des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the French state-controlled insurer, posted a 20 per cent rise in first-half premium income to FFr65bn (Dollars 13bn) from FFr54bn in first-half of 1991, AP-DJ reports from Paris. The provisional figures revealed life insurance revenue rose 39 per cent to FFr32bn from FFr23bn, while casualty registered a 6 per cent gain to FFr33bn from FFr31bn. UAP said the life advance mostly reflected the integration of Sun Life into group accounts as of January 1 1992. UAP said Sun Life boosted first-half premium income in sterling by 37.4 per cent.</p>

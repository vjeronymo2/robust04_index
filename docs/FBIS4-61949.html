			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Larisa Kislinskaya] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 11 TASS -- Rumours about "a war of  monsters" are over-exaggerated, spokesmen for the Russian  Interior Ministry and the Federal Counterintelligence Service,  Vladimir Vorozhtsov and Aleksandr Mikhaylov, told a briefing in  Moscow today.    They were referring to press reports about criminal  proceedings initiated by the Federal Counterintelligence Service  against some high-ranking officials of the Ministry of Internal  Affairs.    The spokesmen said the federal service had indeed detained  some officials, including the former official of the Directorate  for Punitive Action of the Moscow region administration, a  senior investigator and a lawyer. They were caught in the  action while handing over a major sum of money in hard currency  and later charged with an array of crimes. But this does not  amount to a war between the ministry and the federal service,  the spokesman said.    Last year 359 criminal proceedings were initiated against  security officials, mostly by the Interior Ministry. Twenty-two  legal actions were brought jointly with the Federal  Counterintelligence Service. This year 142 crimes were  registered by the Interior Ministry. In eight cases, action was  taken jointly with federal service agents.</p>

			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAL THOMAS ON ABORTION  </P> <P> Thomas' column points to a disturbing trend in our culture, that of  substituting a more palatable reality for the truth. Children don't do this,  and it seems to me that's what really disturbs adults. Somehow they can look at  truth and not shy away from it. Thanks for running this column. Thomas  consistently finds the ethical questions we all ask and so many others are  looking away from.  </P> <P> ANDREA S. LEACH  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P></p>

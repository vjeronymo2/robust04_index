No one on the northbound train was  reported injured in the Sunday evening accident at Le Grand. After a short  delay, the train continued its trip from Bakersfield to Oakland. The Merced  County coroner's office identified the victims as Shane Littleton, 18, Rhonda  Carol Gideon, 21, and Walter Luke Encalade, 29, all of Merced, and Paul Ince,  27, of Le Grand. A CHP officer said all apparently died on impact. He said a  paper bag filled with beer cans was found at the scene.  </P></p>

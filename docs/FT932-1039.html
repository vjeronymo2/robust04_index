			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Double the dose in a bar code Bar codes are widely used on items such as food to identify the item. But in blood transfusion, where large amounts of data need to be carried on the blood bag, more complex options are being investigated. The regional transfusion centres in Oxford, UK, and Kassel, Germany, are looking at a two-dimensional bar code called PDF 417 to identify the donor, reveal test data and so on. Unlike traditional bar codes where data is held in the thickness of the stripes and the height of the bar is irrelevant, PDF417, developed by Symbol Technologies, of Bohemia, New York, and promoted in the UK by Bar Code Systems, contains a series of codes stacked on top of each other. As a result a single code can contain up to 1,750 characters, compared with 13 on a traditional bar code. Symbol Technologies: US, 516 563 2400. Bar Code Systems: UK, 081 549 0909.</p>

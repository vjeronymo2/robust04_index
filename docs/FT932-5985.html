			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Protest blocks Scots harbours FISHERMEN yesterday block-aded Tarbert harbour on the west coast of Scotland in protest at government restrictions on how much time they can spend at sea. More than 200 yachts waiting to take part in a race were trapped during the protest, which also blocked harbours at Kyle of Lochalsh and Oban. Fishermen say they face ruin if they are forced to comply with conservation laws which they say restrict fishing time, in some cases, to just 80 days a year. Sir Hector Monro, Scottish fisheries minister, defended the restrictions as forming part of a 'balanced package' to conserve fish stocks and guarantee the long-term future of the industry. 'The allocation of days at sea are provisional and the intention is to give fishermen as many days to fish as they had in 1991,' he said. If they needed more days they should apply for them, he said, adding: 'We have to take scientific advice on stocks, in the interests of the industry.' Mr John Henderson, skipper of one of the boats blockading the port at Kyle of Lochalsh, said he knew of no fishermen who agreed with the legislation. He said: 'We see this as an evil law, on a par with the legislation that created the Highland Clearances. I don't think the government have thought it through and it isn't going to help conservation - it's going to put fishermen out of business.' Mrs Winnie Ewing, Scottish National party Euro MP for the Highlands and Islands, said Mr John Gummer and Mr David Currie, former agriculture and fisheries ministers, had left a legacy of 'chaos' in the fishing industry. She said Mrs Gillian Shephard, the new agriculture minister, should introduce a properly funded decommissioning scheme. She added: 'It is obvious that the industry is never going to accept the ridiculous days-at-sea legislation.'</p>

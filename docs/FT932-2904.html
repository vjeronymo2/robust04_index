			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / International Company News: Eastman Kodak to spin off chemicals business EASTMAN Kodak, the US photographics products company, yesterday announced plans to spin off its Eastman chemicals business by the end of 1993 as a separate, publicly-quoted company with some Dollars 4bn in annual sales. The move follows shareholder pressure for Kodak to improve its lacklustre financial performance, and comes a month after Mr Kay Whitmore, chairman, said the group would make a large asset divestiture this year. He said yesterday the spin-off was one element of a plan for Kodak which the company would unveil fully in September. The spin-off will take the form of a pro-rata distribution to Kodak shareholders of stock in the independent business, which will be called Eastman Chemical Company and will seek a listing on the New York stock exchange. Kodak will retain no equity. Eastman, founded in 1920 to supply chemicals to Kodak's photographic operations, has grown into the 10th largest US chemicals company, ranked by revenues, with sales to Kodak making up less than 8 per cent of the total. It makes about 400 industrial and specialty products and has particularly strong positions in PET plastic bottle resins and filters for the tobacco industry. Earnings from operations last year totalled Dollars 494m. Wall Street analysts have long urged Kodak to dispose of Eastman, which accounts for about 20 per cent of group revenues, to allow Kodak to concentrate on its core photographic operations and other consumer-focused businesses. Mr Whitmore said the spin-off would create two stronger companies, with the management of each focusing more intently on its businesses. Kodak shares, which rose on Monday in anticipation of yesterday's announcement, fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 52 3/8 at the close of the New York stock exchange. Spin-offs have become particularly popular over the past two years among restructuring US companies. Mr Whitmore said Kodak had chosen the method rather than a sale to an industrial buyer because the chemicals cycle was in a down phase and this would allow Eastman shareholders to participate in any upturn. The deal will remove some Dollars 2bn of debt from Kodak's balance sheet, but Mr Whitmore said this would not change the group's debt to capital ratio. Moody's Investors Service, the credit rating agency, said it had placed Kodak's Dollars 7bn of long-term debt under review for a possible upgrade. Mr Whitmore said that the company was reviewing its non-photographic businesses for operational changes, spin-offs, sales and closures.</p>

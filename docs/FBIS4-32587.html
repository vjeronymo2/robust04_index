			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Jonila Godole: "The U.S. Is Keeping a </F> Stepmother's Eye -- Greece or Albania....?]    [Text] It is now some time since the situation in the  Albanian-Greek relationship became a cause for concern. Many  incidents, Albanians murdered while asleep or awake, beaten en  masse, and so on, but...the problem that makes you forget many  other things is the large number of our refugees that are living  and working in Greece. Analysts underscore the fact that  refugees, including a large number of Albanians, cost Greece  tens of millions of U.S. dollars per year (this figure has been  accurately extracted by a U.S. Commission for the Balkans.)    Nevertheless, the Greek-Albanian "line" is vacillating in  such a way that makes you feel something new is going to happen,  and if we bear in mind the declarations of certain Greek circles  laying claim to Albanian lands, our fears and doubts about peace  between our two countries grow. However, if we refer to foreign  news reports, a certain position of sitting on the fence, or as  our people put it, a "neither here, nor there" stance is to be  observed, particularly on the part of the United States.    For example, in an article published the day before  yesterday  in "The Balkan News," the following parallel conclusions were  drawn: Albania must be convinced that Greek aims do not include  the annexation of North Epirus. In the same way, Greece must be  convinced that it is not Albania's aim in itself to eject the  Greek minority from its southern provinces. Further on, it is  added that the influx of people from Northern Albania (the part  of Kosovo) are aimed at changing the constitution of the  population and the equilibrium in the region. In fact it sounds  strange enough to declare, as the U.S. newspaper does, that  Greece does not have such aims, at a time when events showing  the opposite are taking us by surprise. Another thing that  attracts our attention is the somewhat particular attitude  regarding the two points: Greece and Kosovo.    So the United States alone must be the reliable power,  capable of blaming both sides if necessary, provided the  necessary practice of "good-neighborliness" is guaranteed.    Thus, the United States is helping us, or why not the  Greeks,  if you like....?</p>

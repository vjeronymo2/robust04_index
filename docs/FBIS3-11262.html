Reporter Rey Rodriguez of the  information services of Cuban Television has more details:    [Rodriguez] In a news conference held after Cuba's entry  into  the SITTDEC, Robaina underscored the importance that Cuba's  entry represents.    [Begin Robaina recording] We already had an idea of the  possibilities offered by the center. That is why we came here to  the institution's headquarters, after Cuba's official  incorporation. We have had the privilege of becoming the 15th  member country, since until recently there were only 14 member  countries. In a modest way Cuba has much to offer in many areas  such as the medical field, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals,  sugar, tobacco, coffee, rum, nickel, and in many things that  from an economic standpoint could be useful to several  countries. [end recording]    [Rodriguez] Tomorrow, the Cuban delegation is scheduled to  meet with Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Haji Ahmad  Badawi, and the minister of primary industries, as well as a  meeting in the Ministry of Youth and Sports due to Malaysia's  interest in obtaining Cuban training in that area. The  delegation will also meet with a group of businessmen.    On 21 March, the delegation will depart for Vietnam, the  final stop of a tour through the Asian Continent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Democratic Party Chairman Eduard Selami held a  news conference today. Let's hear a report by our correspondent  Zamira Koleci.    [Koleci] At the news conference held this morning Democratic  Party [PD] leader Selami stressed the party goals for 1994, a  year that he considered to be very important in accomplishing  the PD's program. He greeted the political event that opened  this year -- the Partnership for Peace initiative -- as an  active step toward Albania's admission to NATO.    Selami viewed the policy of rapid privatization and the  proprietorship of as many people as possible as an important  social step that will be accompanied by the introduction of  securities, as defined in the PD's electoral program. He went  on to say that they will be paying attention to increasing  foreign and domestic investment and providing the political  conditions to attract it.    He considered 1994 an important year for Albanian farmers,  too. The support of 3,000 tractors given to farmers will  continue, ensuring financial support through the banks.    In his statement, Selami also spoke about the political  situation, stressing that leftist extremists have introduced a  nihilistic, destructive, and unstable platform, and he explained  this in terms of the hopeless attempts of those who have lost  power.    In answer to a question, Selami said that tensions have been  artificially increased and they are related to initiating the  trial of Alia and Nano, who seem to have put into motion many of  their old and dubious ties.    Selami said that the PD favors dialogue and this requires a  serious commitment. Meanwhile, the Democratic Alliance [AD] is  accusing the PD of organizing crime at all levels. Selami said  that they had declared that they are the opposition but  brothers, while the AD leaders are for freedom or death.    PD Secretary General Tritan Shehu repeated yesterday's  request to parliament that its Foreign Committee examine the AD  visit to Belgrade, which, according to Shehu, is against the  national interest.

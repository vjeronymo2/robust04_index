			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are amending the Fruits and Vegetables regulations by allowing the importation of Fuji variety apples from Japan and the Republic of Korea.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to an estimate by the International Apple Institute, U.S. growers produced approximately 160 million pounds of Fuji apples in 1993, about 1.5 percent of the total U.S. apple production for that year. It is likely that this estimate understates the amount of Fuji apples produced domestically, as Fuji acreage in California, Washington, and other States is expanding rapidly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> About 75 percent of the Fuji variety apples grown in the United States are grown in California and Washington. In 1993, growers in California and Washington produced about 60 million pounds per State, while growers in other States produced a total of about 40 million pounds. Statistics on the number of domestic growers of Fuji apples and their sizes are not available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most of the domestic production of Fuji apples is exported because demand, and consequently the price, for Fuji apples is quite low in the United States as compared to other countries, particularly in the Pacific Rim. Prices of $30 to $50 per 40-pound box (depending upon quality) are common in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other Pacific Rim markets. Domestic buyers, however, have been paying less than half that price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Growers in the Republic of Korea produce annually about 923 million pounds of Fuji variety apples. APHIS estimates that about 220,000 to 440,000 pounds of Fuji variety apples might be exported per year from the Republic of Korea to the United States. This estimate assumes the Republic of Korea's exports to the United States will approach levels currently exported to European countries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Japanese growers produce annually about 1.18 billion pounds of Fuji variety apples, just over half of Japan's total annual apple production. APHIS estimates that exports to the United States of all varieties of Japanese apples would probably never exceed 2.2 million pounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is unlikely that imports of Fuji variety apples from Japan and the Republic of Korea will reach the estimated levels above, due to the low demand and low price for Fuji variety apples in the United States. However, even if imports were to reach 2.6 million pounds (2.2 million pounds from Japan and 440,000 pounds from the Republic of Korea), this would constitute less than 1.4 percent of domestic production of Fuji variety apples. Consequently, allowing Fuji variety apples to be imported from Japan and the Republic of Korea will not have a significant economic impact on domestic Fuji variety apple producers or other small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12778  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule allows Fuji variety apples to be imported into the United States from Japan and the Republic of Korea under certain conditions. State and local laws and regulations regarding Fuji variety apples imported under this rule will be preempted while the fruit is in foreign commerce. Fresh apples are generally imported for immediate distribution and sale to the consuming public, and will remain in foreign commerce until sold to the ultimate consumer. The question of when foreign commerce ceases in other cases must be addressed on a case-by-case basis. No retroactive effect will be given to this rule; and this rule will not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), the information collection or recordkeeping requirements included in this final rule will be submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7 CFR Part 300  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Incorporation by reference, Plant diseases and pests, Quarantine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7 CFR Part 319  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Bees, Coffee, Cotton, Fruits, Honey, Imports, Incorporation by reference, Nursery Stock, Plant diseases and pests, Quarantine, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Rice, Vegetables.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, title 7, chapter III, of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 300_INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

The agreement requires the national plant protection agency to pay in advance of each shipping season all costs that APHIS estimates it will incur in providing services in Japan or the Republic of Korea during that shipping season. These costs include administrative expenses and all salaries (including overtime and the Federal share of employee benefits), travel expenses (including per diem expenses), and other incidental expenses incurred by APHIS in performing these services. The agreement requires the national plant protection agency to deposit a certified or cashiers check with APHIS for the amount of these costs, as estimated by APHIS. If the deposit is not sufficient to meet all costs incurred by APHIS, the agreement further requires the national plant protection agency to deposit with APHIS a certified or cashiers check for the amount of the remaining costs, as determined by APHIS, before APHIS will provide any more services necessary for Fuji variety apples to be imported into the United States from that country. After a final audit at the conclusion of each shipping season, any overpayment of funds will be returned to the national plant protection agency, or held on account until needed, at that agency's option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department not responsible for damage.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The treatments prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section are judged from experimental tests to be safe for use with Fuji variety apples from Japan and the Republic of Korea.

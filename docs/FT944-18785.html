			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Costly chip off an old block - Clive Fewins visits a family stonemasons which nearly cracked after 200 years The idiosyncratic stonemasons' yard at Lloyds of Great Bedwyn, near Marlborough, Wiltshire has been an irresistible lure for generations of children from the village school next door. 'Press the button and the fountain will work,' says the ageing hand-cut plaque attached to a statue of a greek goddess that stands precariously on the front wall. It still does work. Follow the instructions and a huge and noisy plume of water cascades from a giant urn at the rear of the yard, which also houses a bewildering array of items, from Chinese granite lions to teddy bear headstones, medieval-style carved grotesque heads, and a scaled-down stone replica of a Sopwith Camel first world war aircraft carved as a memorial to an airman killed in 1917. All the 'exhibits' in the yard are of stone, as are the 100 or so plaques and inscriptions in the collection attached to the side of the Victorian brick headquarters of the five-man company. They have been collected by members of the seven generations of Lloyd who have run the family business, and passers-by are welcome to drop in and view the collection. One might reasonably think such an established enterprise serving a wide area with items from churchyard memorials to marble bathrooms, floors, worktops, fireplaces and stone garden ornaments, would be as solid as the Bank of England. Yet two years ago the business came as close to collapse as it has in 204 years of existence. John Lloyd, 38, who took over the reins from his father Ben 12 years ago, is still paying the price for a brief collaboration with an old friend that lasted two years and had damaging effects on his original business. 'Despite the onset of the recession in the late 1980s we were doing really well. I had a staff of five, plus a secretary, and we were turning over Pounds 250,000,' said Lloyd. 'We were having to work harder for our money than we did in the boom of the mid-80s, but life was varied and enjoyable, and there was no shortage of work, including a number of lucrative marble fitting jobs in London. 'We had managed to keep up with mechanisation, and there was still a healthy demand for the high quality hand letter cutting in which we have always specialised. However with the increase in demand for marble work I thought it would be a good idea to join up with an old friend who was disillusioned with his job working for a major marble importer, and form a new enterprise importing and wholesaling all forms of marble. 'We ran the business as a separate entity from here. The first mistake I made was to resolve to draw no salary from the new business, believing, in my naivety, that it would pay me back later. 'After 12 months I was aware that I was putting three-and-a-half days a week into the new venture and the masonry business was suffering. 'Almost before I realised it the family business had built up an overdraft of Pounds 40,000 - we had never owed anything like that before - and the bank was getting uneasy. My neglect of the family business meant that the work volume dropped because I was putting in less time and thought into gaining the all-important small jobs that traditionally grew out of bigger contracts. 'Further, having realised what was going on I was far too slow to act. By the time I stood firm, things were so bad that my main business was on the point of foundering. 'The family firm had been landlord to the other enterprise, and was also bearing nearly all the overheads and even supplying some of the staff. It was therefore no surprise that the new venture was making money at the expense of the older one, and also sucking the life blood out of it.' By the time Lloyd decided to cut his losses and get out, the stonemasonry business was turning over less than Pounds 100,000. He sold his share of the new business for Pounds 30,000 and heaved a sigh of relief. He estimates that, altogether, lost earnings, additional overheads and payments for the redundancies that followed the episode cost him nearly Pounds 100,000. 'It was a very low period. I felt I had been a total fool and this hit very hard. 'But now, two years after it all came to an end, I realise that the episode made me look hard at things and determine to improve our ways of doing business,' Lloyd said. Fortunately there was a white knight waiting in the wings. Charles Webb, the father of Lloyd's long-time girlfriend had recently retired from running a water management system company, and he immediately set about trying to right things. Lloyd had the unpleasant task of making two long-serving employees redundant, thus reducing the male workforce to three plus himself, and then carrying out a full stock check at Webb's insistence. Webb also persuaded him to sell surplus unwanted stock and end his time-honoured practice of buying small pieces of stone he liked the look of when visiting a wholesaler because he thought they would be useful additions to his stock. Webb also insisted that the huge collection of statuary and stone artefacts outside should be made the personal possession of Lloyd so that if the business foundered it might not have to be sold. He also introduced computers - which Lloyd still loathes - cash flow projections, and a new accounting system. He gave - and still gives - his spare-time services free of charge. The result was that last year after nearly two years of foregoing a salary and living off savings, Lloyd was able to start paying himself again. This year the overdraft slowly began to drop and he is thinking of taking on a trainee to join his three other men. 'Turnover this year should be about Pounds 120,000 and I am hoping we shall show a profit of a few hundred pounds,' Lloyd said. 'I have learned a lot - particularly the wisdom of drawing up a full legal agreement before entering into an partnership, even if it is with an old friend. 'However, the one thing I won't do is give up my ledgers,' he said. 'The firm has a collection of written records going back to 1800 and I can easily open a ledger and look up details of jobs going back as much as 70 years. 'This can be very useful. Only a few months ago I had a chap come in who seemed very grand. He wanted a memorial, and baulked at paying a deposit, saying his family had traded with us for several generations, though he admitted they hadn't used us since the 1950s. 'We sat together and thumbed back through the ledger until we found the record of the job, 40 years ago. A neat note on the bottom of the entry in my grandfather's handwriting stated that these customers were slow to pay. The point was taken. Nothing was said, but he gave me a deposit.'

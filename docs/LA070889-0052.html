			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOME OFFICIALS MOVING TOWARD ABORTION RIGHTS;  </P> <P> 3 GOVERNOR HOPEFULS SEEM TO SOFTEN STANDS AGAINST PROCEDURE  </P> <P> With this week's U.S. Supreme Court decision forcing them to take a stand in  the emotional abortion debate, early indications are that some politicians long  considered part of the anti-abortion camp have begun to move closer to the  abortion rights forces.  </P> <P> To a certain extent, this erosion may indicate concern over the political  strength long-dormant pro-choice groups are expected to muster, now that the  Supreme Court has moved abortion to the top of the national agenda.  </P> <P> One of the most dramatic defections was that of Illinois Atty. Gen. Neil  Hartigan, who has long said he was personally opposed to abortion. He is also  highly visible as the official who will be urging the Supreme Court this fall  to allow his state to impose abortion restrictions more far-reaching than those  the court upheld in the Missouri case handed down Monday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Huddled With Advisers  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Hartigan declared Friday that "the right of privacy is of  paramount importance. I support the woman's freedom of choice" to have an  abortion. His announcement, which drew fire from activists on both sides, came  after he had huddled several days with advisers for his possible run for  governor, where he is viewed as the strongest of the likely Democratic  contenders.  </P> <P> In Massachusetts, former Atty. Gen. Francis X. Bellotti, another Democratic  candidate for governor, issued a statement supporting abortion rights  immediately after the court decision, despite his record of defending the  state's anti-abortion laws. A 1979 Supreme Court case bearing his name, Baird  vs. Bellotti, established a system under which a minor must have both parents'  permission to get an abortion, unless a judge intervenes.  </P> <P> "Bellotti is begining to be convinced that the abortion issue is a critical  issue and that he needs to be pro-choice to win," said Joyce Cunha, director of  Mass. Choice. "We're going to be very skeptical."  </P> <P> All the shifts have not been so clear, nor have they all come from Democrats,  whose national party supports abortion rights.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Apparent Softening of Stand  </P> <P> Rep. Jim Courter, the GOP nominee for New Jersey governor, has a congressional  voting record that pits him squarely against abortion. But he appeared to  soften that position somewhat earlier this week.  </P> <P> Courter told the Bergen Record, in an interview published Thursday, that  "there's not the consensus here to modify the laws we now have in order to  restrict abortions."  </P> <P> "The laws aren't going to change," he said. "For myself, it's never been on the  top of the agenda."  </P> <P> A recent poll by the Record found that more than two-thirds of the state's  residents oppose a ban on abortion.  </P> <P> "You're going to see a lot of what Courter is doing -- a lot of anti-choice  candidates trying to downplay this issue," said Nancy Broff, political and  legislative director of the National Abortion Rights Action League, which plans  to pour hundreds of thousands of dollars into the New Jersey governor's race  alone.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court's decision is seen as a turning point, from which the court's  new conservative majority is expected to chip away at its 1973 Roe vs. Wade  decision that established abortion as a national right.  </P> <P> Thus, in the next few years, for the first time in almost two decades,  sometimes reluctant state politicians will be handed the power to decide  whether to place restrictions on abortion.  </P> <P> Politicians trying to find a middle ground between the two views, or shifting  from one side to the other, are finding themselves drawing fire from both.  </P> <P> Hartigan, for example, attempted to reconcile his personal views with his  public stand by saying: "The choice may not be one that I would advise a woman  to make, but in a pluralistic society, a society like ours, the differences of  opinions and beliefs must be tolerated."  </P> <P> "I don't think his political strategists served him well by this," said Ralph  Rivera, chairman of the Illinois Pro-Life Coalition Political Action Committee.  "I feel he is trying to get votes from both sides. It won't work."  </P> <P> Patricia Dougherty, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action  League's Illinois chapter, also was critical of Hartigan's statement. "It  doesn't do anything for me . . . . I find it disturbing when he talks about  tolerating. (The issue) is not to tolerate, but to protect these rights."  </P></p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / People: Presiding over 'creative chaos' - A love of travel led the young Peter Job to Reuters. Now, says Katharine Campbell, his empire extends to 150 countries Step into Reuters' corporate headquarters at 85 Fleet Street, London, and the foyer - not even a clock in view - gives no hint of a pioneering media business flashing information to 150 countries at a rate of more than 1,000 updates per second. Meet its chief executive, Peter Job, and there is equally little evidence of the steel you might imagine necessary to drive a company whose arrogance in the marketplace has been a by-word among its customers. Job reckons that the importance of the chief executive's role can be over-stressed. A young-looking 53 in a plain white shirt, tie skewed round revealing its Dunhill label, he hardly looks like the boss of Britain's largest media company - turnover last year: Pounds 1.9bn; post-tax profit: Pounds 300m. 'I'm sure the visionary entrepreneur leaping around inspiring everyone is a perfectly good model. But it is not ours,' he says. 'He's so bloody quiet he gets overlooked,' says Sir Christopher Hogg, Reuters' chairman, who, not surprisingly, is a great fan of the 'undramatic' style of management. Three-and-a-half years ago, Job, running Reuters' Asian businesses, was picked from colleagues heading Reuters' other regional 'baronies' - David Ure, in Europe, and Andre Villeneuve, responsible for the Americas - to succeed Glen Renfrew, a tough Australian who was bowing out after a decade at the top. Reuters was suffering from the recession, new products were behind schedule, and the likes of Telerate and Bloomberg had blossomed into fearsome competitors. Job's task was to refocus an organisation that had long enjoyed the luxury of behaving like a quasi-monopoly, largely ignoring its customers' needs. It was a measure of the management time this consumed that Reuters last year took the unusual step of a large share repurchase, effectively handing back Pounds 351m to shareholders. The company had been piling up cash and senior executives felt they had insufficient time to spend it sensibly. More recently, energies have centred on expansion, with a clutch of acquisitions ranging from equity data system Quotron to Teknekron, a Californian software supplier. Last week, Reuters's first radio station, London News Radio, went on air. In good Reuters tradition, Job is a journalist by training, despite the fact that news these days contributes only 7 per cent of total revenues. Information products, principally financial, make up 72 per cent of sales, and transaction products, such as equity dealing systems, the balance. He has spent his working life at Reuters. Between them, Job, Ure and Villeneuve have given the company 85 years of their lives. But the young Job claims not to have felt a vocational calling. Following an Oxford modern languages degree, he says he applied for 'all the usual things', flunking both the Foreign Office exams and his interview for the BBC (he arrived an hour late). It was almost entirely because of a yen to travel that he wound up at Reuters. After two years' tedium in London - 'they kicked your chair periodically to see if you were awake' - his first proper posting was Delhi. There he relished stories about famine, turbulence and revolution, and moved to Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta before returning to London in the late 1960s. An 'adequate but by no means brilliant' journalist, according to a one-time boss, Job switched into management, but not because he sensed he was marked for higher things. 'I discovered when I returned from abroad that I was being paid below the union minimum wage.' There followed three years in Latin America, where he learnt to 'savour the idea of making money' rather than following his natural inclinations to make a mark by pruning costs. In 1978, at the age of 37, Job was put in charge of Asia, largely because he convinced his superiors of the lunacy of managing Japan from London. He spent all but three of the next 13 years based in Hong Kong. It was a period of tremendous expansion. Revenues from the region, still only Pounds 41m in 1982, were Pounds 279m by 1991. It was to his great surprise, he claims - apparently genuinely - that after gaining a seat on the board in 1988 he was named chief executive three years later. 'The serious new boy,' as he describes himself, settled down to effect a change of style rather than direction. Internally, that meant a more consensual form of management. It must be partly down to Job - as well as to the power of the Reuters culture - that Ure and Villeneuve did not quit in a huff, but one senses that the price for Job's elevation is that he operates somewhat primus inter pares. 'I can't remember taking a major initiative without consulting the top team members,' he acknowledges. 'Except once, when I forgot. And I certainly regretted that later.' Job reckons that the ability to deliver better products at more or less stable prices over a three-year period has helped Reuters' image considerably, although efforts to decentralise, and put decision-making nearer to the customer, have not always registered clearly with customers. The nimble Bloomberg gets consistently higher marks in terms of responsiveness. One thing Job likes is constant travel. He has visited more than 70 countries since he joined Reuters. As well as keeping him in touch with customers, travel suits his modus operandi, what Hogg describes as 'a radar-scanner searching all parts of the business'. It is a pretty informal style. 'I have long thought it one of the least 'managed' companies around,' says one client, adding that Job's regime 'co-exists with this extraordinary concentration of very bright people. I suppose you could call it creative chaos.' There are no visionary statements about the multimedia future from Job, no platitudes from a man who distrusts management jargon. 'We see through a glass darkly,' he says. 'We are loath to commit ourselves to a grand strategy.' It is rather a case of 'keeping the quiver full of arrows' and expanding in an 'opportunistic way - if that doesn't sound too derogatory'. But surely a board composed of executive directors, only one of whom has ever worked outside Reuters (and that not for 16 years), must be prey to introspection in its long-term planning? Job acknowledges Hogg's contribution. 'I simply don't know what I would do if I couldn't call on his expertise. With the share buy-back, for instance, he undoubtedly had a clearer view than the rest of us as to the options we faced.' While Hogg defends Job's low-key style to the hilt, the chief executive's unwillingness to spout on strategy, combined with a lack of presentational skills, has perplexed the investment community, particularly in America. 'At the beginning, every time he opened his mouth the share price went down,' says one fund manager, who reckons colleagues are now warming to Job - slightly. Further down the organisation, there is a solid internal constituency that perceives a lack of leadership, and a man 'far less approachable' than Renfrew. Where Job gets excited about Reuters' push into television, overstretched (and cynical, Job would say) journalists see a management out of touch with practicalities. 'If the bomb goes up, do you file for text, radio or TV?' asks one. Asked whether he will be the last journalist to run Reuters, Job paused lengthily and gave no clear answer. But what he has to demonstrate is that it is not necessarily the most glamorous types who best run the most fashionable and exciting companies. Or perhaps, given Reuters' collective experience at the top, the task is less complex than it looks. According to Hogg: 'Reuters has been in the right place at the right time. The great thing is not to blow that.'</p>

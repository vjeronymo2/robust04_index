			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / International Company News: TWA cuts jobs and services TRANS World Airlines, the US carrier operating under the protection of Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code, said it has set a winter schedule effective from October 25 under which it will eliminate service to 12 cities, Reuter reports from New York. The workforce will be cut by up to 10 per cent as a result of the changes. The carrier said it will stop flying to Istanbul, Moscow, Copenhagen and Stockholm and to eight US cities. TWA said the 'reallocation' of its resources, coupled with implementation of agreements calling for a 15 per cent wage and benefit cut and work-rule concessions by all US employees in exchange for a 45 per cent equity stake in the airline, would result in a 'revitalised' TWA.</p>

According to data available at the Ministry of Building  Materials Industry, it showed a 20 percent gain in the first two  months or more of this year as against the same period last  year. The output in 20 odd days of March was 10,000 tons more  than in the comparable period of the previous month.    The cement industry of Korea has a great potential. There  are in the country hundreds of large and minor cement  factories, among them the 3 million ton-capacity Sunchon cement  complex and the 2 million ton-capacity Sangwon cement complex.  Inexhaustible deposits of raw materials and fuel for cement are  found in all parts of the country. There are more than one  hundred of seams of limestone, the basic raw material of cement,  and coal deposits run into tens of billions of tons.    The independent and modern cement industry which is  developing in reliance upon rich domestic raw materials and fuel  firmly guarantees the economic construction of the country.  This is graphically illustrated by the construction of vast  scale during the Third Seven-Year Plan period (1987-1993). In  that period the construction of major projects including power  bases, metal industrial bases and chemical industrial bases was  pushed forward bringing more than 11,000 projects to completion  in the industrial sector alone.    The monument to the Victorious Fatherland Liberation War,  the  Three-Revolution Exhibition, the Mangyongdae School Children's  Palace, the May Day Stadium, gymnasiums in Chongchun Street and  many other monumental edifices were built in the capital city of  Pyongyang and upwards of 3,200 educational, cultural and health  care institutions, various welfare service facilities and  residential houses for over 1 million families were constructed  throughout the country.    The state satisfactorily met the demand for cement in this  vast construction with domestic products, and exported a large  quantity of it.    The renowned Korean cement of "Kumgang" brand was awarded  twice the gold medal on the international market.</p>

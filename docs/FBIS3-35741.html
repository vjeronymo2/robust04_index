			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kyrgyz </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Askar Akayev by unidentified </F> correspondent; place and date not given -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Akayev, in Russian] We do not want to create a  commonplace mentality in our people. Of course, it should  combine the best features that every nation has. We will be  able to get out of the current crisis provided we observe this  condition. Our national policy naturally envisages protection  of rights of all the peoples [words indistinct] of Kyrgyzstan.  I believe that this is the guarantee for our future, peace,  calm, and accord.    [Correspondent] We are implementing the policy of market  reforms in our country and life has become exceptionally  difficult for our people. There are lots of cases when people  haven't been paid their salaries, students their scholarships,  children's allowances haven't be granted in time as well as  pensions. People complain about that. It worries them. What  can you say about that?    [Akayev] We are implementing market reforms in our country  and unfortunately they are not proceeding as they should.  Indeed, life is becoming more difficult. We should carry out a  socially oriented policy and support our less well off sections  of society.If pensions, wages and scholarships have been paid in  time this would have partly solved their problems. Therefore,  we have set up a state commission under the president of our  republic with the aim of supervising the issue of timely payment  of them. It should exercise control over a timely payment of  salaries, stipends and pensions and it will work for as long as  needed. [sentence indistinct]    [Correspondent] Can you tell us few words about our foreign  policy?    [Akayev] We have been recognized and established contacts  with many democratic countries of the world [words indistinct].  If we speak about our priorities, our first priority is to have  historically friendly relations with such countries as Russia,  Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. This is our main priority. Apart  from this, with the introduction of economic reforms and  democratic transformations, we have established good relations  with the United States, Japan, Germany, Turkey, Switzerland, and  other countries. We also have good relations with the Muslim  countries and China -- we have signed agreements with them on  friendship, cooperation and mutual understanding. Kyrgyzstan,  as an equal among equals, has its own embassies and consulates  in various countries. [passage indistinct]    [Correspondent, in Russian] I wanted to ask you a question  about socio-economic (?reforms). We have received a letter with  this question. It has been sent to us by Sholpon Adilbekova, a  student of the foreign language college of Kyrgyzstan. Here is  the question: Askar Akayevich! I have familiarized myself with  your concept for socio-economic strategy and I fully support it.  But are you sure that the government will be able to implement  this program. What is you view [words indistinct]?    [Akayev, in Russian] First of all, I would like to express  my  deepest gratitude to Sholpon. I am pleased that even students  are following with great interest ways of Kyrgyzstan's  development. They will have to build a democratic and legal  state one day and the foundation for it is being built by us.  It has been enshrined by the Constitution of Kyrgyzstan. Young  people will have to build a free market economy which will focus  its attention on man and his interests. Therefore, we have set  a goal of not only building a market economy but of building a  socially oriented market economy which will protect interests of  our young people. The one which will provide them with jobs and  opportunities to reveal their talents and their potential.    With regard to implementation of this program I am sure  that,  we with a new government, will be able to implement the program  of reforms. The new government has been supported by the  parliament. I have met people in practically all the regions of  the republic and people on the whole support the new government.  With regard to the president -- he, according to the new  constitution, has the right to exercise control over the  government's work. The president has the right to chair the  government's sessions during its examination of the most  important issues of socio-economic development and to take the  decisions. I want our young people to know that we are not  going to turn back from our path of reforms. And we will  achieve success in their implementation. [passage indistinct]</p>

			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Polish coal deal COAL miners at 65 Polish pits are to vote on Monday on a New Year's Eve agreement between strike leaders and the government which could end the most widespread stoppage in the industry's history, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. The protocol commits the government to restructuring the coal mines' debt of 8,000bn zlotys (Pounds 334m) and providing subsidies worth 1,700bn zlotys. The government has also said it will turn to international financial institutions for modernisation loans for the industry. The end of the 19-day strike would see the resumption of coal exports, which the government banned last week in view of possible domestic fuel shortages.</p>

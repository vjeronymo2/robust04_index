			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Enterprise shareholders support bid for Lasmo The controversial strategy of Mr Graham Hearne, chairman and chief executive of Enterprise Oil, was vindicated by shareholders yesterday as they voted overwhelmingly in support of his Pounds 1.3bn hostile bid for Lasmo, the rival oil explorer, at an extraordinary meeting in London. Mr Hearne, who has been criticised over the logic of the all-paper bid and accused of megalomania, departed from his prepared text to thank investors after the vote. 'It is nice to know our shareholders are behind us,' he said. Enterprise arrived at the meeting armed with proxies representing substantially more than 50 per cent of the total equity base. Of those, 99 per cent had voted in favour of the bid, said Mr Hearne. Investors made it clear, however, that it was the all-paper bid as it currently stands which they backed. 'I would hate to see Enterprise stumping up another 10 per cent in cash,' one private shareholder remarked. Mr Hearne said he stood by the package on offer, which combines Enterprise A shares and warrants - although the board would have to retain some flexibility. It has been widely speculated that Enterprise would have to revise its offer to win over Lasmo investors, particularly as its shares have fallen from 445p to yesterday's 401p since the bid was launched. Enterprise has several options - from introducing some form of cash which could be unpopular with its own shareholders, to revising the paper offer in the light of its own weaker price to bring the value of the bid back up to 150p a share. The EGM lasted less than 30 minutes, with investors choosing to ignore Lasmo's attempts at calling their company's accounting practices into question. Mr Hearne was not content to let the matter lie, however. 'Lasmo is trying to defend itself by publishing a series of increasingly tall stories designed to distract share-holders from the issues,' he said. Enterprise remained convinced that the deal would bring value to both sets of shareholders.</p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Serbs may face stiffer air power Tighter economic sanctions and tougher use of Nato air power against the Serbs will top the agenda at today's meeting in Geneva of the five nations which are trying to impose a Bosnian settlement. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said he and his counterparts from the UK, France, Germany and Russia would consider stricter enforcement of the exclusion zones designed to protect the Bosnian Moslems. 'That will require perhaps a further use of Nato air power,' he said. Shoring up the existing sanctions and exclusion zones would be a milder course of action than one demanded by many US politicians: lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia's Moslem-led government. But the US administration appears to have soft-pedalled on this idea, for the sake of preserving unity in the five-nation contact group. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, said Britain remained opposed to lifting the arms embargo, although it would not stand in the way if international support for such a move built up. Russia is thought likely to acquiesce in some form of pressure on the Serbs, as long as the raising of the arms embargo - which would be anathema in Moscow - is kept off the agenda. The peace plan's virtual rejection by the Serbs has caused anger in western capitals and embarrassment in Russia, a traditional Serb ally. Senior Russian officials have unsuccessfully tried this week to persuade the Bosnian Serbs to come up with a more reasonable negotiating position. Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev said yesterday his government felt it had been deceived by the Bosnian Serbs. 'We've done all we can for the Serbs,' he said.</p>

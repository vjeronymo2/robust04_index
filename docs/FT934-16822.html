			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Crisis in Russia: Assault tactics puzzle experts - Western military surprised by number of troops used and timescale MILITARY experts were puzzled yesterday by the tactics used in the assault against Moscow's parliament building. Despite the success of the operation, they said they would have expected a much larger force to be deployed to ensure a quick result. They were surprised that no attempt was made to set up a security cordon to keep crowds back and allow forces to take over the White House unimpeded. Instead, bystanders were allowed to come between the firing line and the building. About 500-700 troops were thought to have been involved in clearing the building itself, with about 1,000 more - two battalions' worth - in the immediate vicinity. Armoured vehicles from crack airborne units, which could have ferried forces in by helicopter, were not sighted until late in the proceedings. Perhaps most astonishing was the apparently hasty preparation. Tanks did not come with their ammunition loaded, as would normally be the case. According to western experts, the operation relied mainly on two divisions, with tanks from the 4th Guards tank division and armoured personnel carriers from the 2nd Guards motor rifle division. Both these divisions were deployed during the abortive 1991 coup. Mr Yeltsin has credited them with refusing to attack the parliament building on that occasion. Also involved were elements of the Interior Ministry Dzerzhinsky division, the 27th motor rifle brigade, as well as the Kremlin Guard, which reinforced its positions on Sunday night, and elite army special units, employed in the storming of the White House. Experts saw several possible explanations for what they described as the 'unusual' nature of the operation: An effort to keep casualties down, partly in response to international pressures. However, one expert pointed out: 'It is not necessarily a good way of minimising casualties to attack a building with an insufficient force.' Concern about stirring up the civilian population. An indication that Mr Yeltsin did not have many reliable units to call on. Hasty preparation could suggest that initial plans for storming the building had to be substituted. Most senior military figures are thought to have been extremely reluctant to become involved in the politicalstruggle. Experts believe the scenes in Moscow may have built up resentment in the military against Mr Yeltsin's handling of the crisis. They also believe it may be harder for him to count on military support as he confronts regional demands for autonomy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Faysal al-Husayni by Karmit Gay </F> and Moti Amir; place not given -- live]    [Text] [Gay] Mr. al-Husayni, Yasir 'Arafat is constantly  raising new demands and conditions for his arrival. It looks as  though he is in no hurry to arrive.    [Al-Husayni] Look, the issue here is not new conditions.  If we are talking about real peace; if Mr. Rabin has decided to  make peace with the person who issued the orders to wage a  struggle against Israel; if Yasir 'Arafat, in turn, is making  peace with Rabin, who also issued orders of such a nature, then  I believe those who carried out these orders must not remain in  prison. We, too, must close all the cases against Israelis  rather than say that Israelis who killed Palestinians must be  dealt with.    [Gay] That is a different issue. I want to ask you,  however, why 'Arafat constantly postpones his arrival here?  What does this have to do with other issues? After all, he can  continue the negotiations from his office in Jericho.    [Al-Husayni] Look, there is no point in 'Arafat coming here  and acting as though real peace is on its way, while at the same  time prisoners remain incarcerated for no reason. I do not  understand why there are still prisoners and why no female  prisoner has been released so far. We can see that whenever the  Palestinians carry out a new move, the Israelis evince an  inflexible attitude regarding the prisoners issue. The Israelis  must tell us clearly whether they do not want to release the  prisoners or how long it will take. We want to understand this.    [Amir] Mr. al-Husayni, the negotiations over the release of  prisoners will take several months. The issue of international  observers will also take months to be resolved. This means that  'Arafat will in fact arrive only when the entire West Bank is  under Palestinian self-rule.    [Al-Husayni] Not exactly. I must tell you, however, that  Yasir 'Arafat cannot come under the present conditions. When  Nabil Sha'th came to Jericho, he was forced to wait for several  hours near al-'Awja' and several more hours near the bridge. If  such issues are not resolved, 'Arafat will not be able to come.  When he comes, he will come as a generally recognized national  leader. I do not know how the Israelis intend to deal with  Yasir 'Arafat when he arrives. If these issues are not  resolved, I do not believe he can come.    [Amir] Is it true that Dr. Sha'th recommended that 'Arafat  delay his arrival in Jericho because of what happened to Sha'th  in Jericho or because his request to visit Jerusalem was refused?    [Al-Husayni] No, no. What I am saying is that every day we  see something new which proves to us that the Israelis are not  honoring the spirit of the agreement. Nabil Sha'th said he  wanted to make a private visit to Jerusalem to meet friends.  Once he said this, everything was done to prevent the visit,  and he was also harassed in Jericho. If 'Arafat comes to  Jericho and says something some Israelis do not like, then he  will be punished by not being allowed to travel to Gaza until he  writes letters and waits several days. We do not understand and  cannot accept such a situation.    [Gay] This morning the prime minister is convening a meeting  regarding the PLO's attempts to create political facts in  Jerusalem. Apparently, the prime minister does not want to  legislate laws regarding this issue but to deal with each  attempt separately. What do you think about this?    [Al-Husayni] Look, every day there are new Israeli buildings  in Jerusalem; every day more Israelis come to live in East  Jerusalem. In the past, the Palestinians constituted 100  percent of the residents of East Jerusalem; now they constitute  less than 50 percent. We are not allowed to build houses.  Houses built because of the housing shortage in East Jerusalem  are being demolished. Now the Israelis come and say that it is  the Palestinians who are trying to create new facts in  Jerusalem. All we are asking for is to live normally in  Jerusalem.    [Gay] Do you not want to turn Orient House into the  Palestinian government building?    [Al-Husayni] Who said that Orient House has become the  Palestinian government? From its inception, Orient House has  been totally dedicated to the issue of peace. We have still not  completed the peace process. Once it is completed, we will see  what to do with Orient House, but until then, it will continue  to fulfill its mission. You know very well that the issue of  Jerusalem has still not been ironed out. The negotiations on  this issue are supposed to start within the next two years. So  why should you seek to determine the Jerusalem issue now? You  should wait until the negotiations start. Perhaps Israel is in  fact implying that there are no negotiations and that the  agreement was only meant to hold the Palestinians back while  Israel does whatever it must to finalize everything and leave  nothing for the negotiations.</p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Sinking in the trough Tighter money in the US has made financial markets there supremely sensitive to any signs of rising inflation, and the obsession seems to be spreading. Yesterday's UK inflation figures played into the hands of the Jeremiahs, though the disappointment was largely superficial. There has been some faintly worrying background noise in the housing market, on average earnings and commodity prices, but producer price inflation is still depressed and the 0.6 per cent monthly jump in February's retail prices index owed much to the end of the January sales. Since the retail sales figure for that month was weak, higher prices in the shops may not stick. Yesterday's figures need not undermine expectations of a further fall in the headline rate of inflation later this summer. But the conclusion on interest rates is different. The authorities would suffer a serious loss of credibility if they cut rates on the back of yesterday's figures. Next month's data will be perilously close to the European and local elections. Cutting rates then would invite the charge of political influence on monetary policy. The hope must be that the economy has enough momentum to shrug off next month's tax rises. If so, the eventual judgment will be there was never any need for another base rate cut anyway. But growth cannot continue indefinitely without some pressure on prices. Barring a serious hiccup in the recovery, the trough in rates may have been reached. Yesterday's 46-point fall in the equity market suggests this point is finally sinking in.</p>

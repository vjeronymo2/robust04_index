			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Greek state pay rise to top 7% Greece's socialist government is about to approve a 1994 pay increase for state workers of 5 per cent in January and 5 per cent in July, Labour Minister Evangelos Yiannopoulos said yesterday, Reuter reports from Athens. He expected the government to finalise its decision tomorrow. The pay rise, averaging 7-8 per cent over the year, would be adjusted in January 1995 if the government failed to cut inflation to under 10 per cent by December. Inflation was 12.1 per cent year-on-year at the end of 1993.</p>

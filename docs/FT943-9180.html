			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Equifax attacks bid recommendation Equifax, the US credit information group, has hit out at the UAPT-Infolink board recommendation of a lower takeover bid from Trans Union. In a letter to shareholders, Equifax said that if the board was concerned that its 600p a share offer would be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, then it should wait for a judgment before advising shareholders. Trans Union has offered 50p less, but because it has no UK operations its bid has no risk of a referral, whereas Equifax's offer is conditional upon approval by the Office of Fair Trading.</p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Ministers bullish on VAT vote win Senior ministers were increasingly confident yesterday that the government would be able to beat off a Labour attempt to force a vote on the second stage of the imposition of value added tax on heating fuel. But the vote appears likely to be close after confirmation that the nine Ulster Unionist MPs, who supported the government in Monday's confidence vote on Europe, will vote with the opposition. But Tory whips are hopeful that no more than half of the dozen Tory VAT rebels will go through with threats to defy the party whip - suggesting that the government will have a majority of between two and eight votes. Two Conservative backbenchers announced in the Commons last night that they would not back the government next week in the vote. Mr Nicholas Winterton, Conservative MP for Macclesfield, said there was 'little to celebrate in the Budget'. He added: 'The decision to proceed bull-headed with the imposition of the second tranche of VAT on domestic fuel bills will be widely resented.' Mr Phil Gallie, the Conservative MP for Ayr and another critic of the decision to impose 17.5 per cent VAT on domestic fuel, said he would abstain when Labour's procedural motion was put to the vote on Tuesday night. However, senior ministers think that much of the steam has gone out of the rebellion since the failure of rightwing attempts to raise sufficient support for a challenge to Mr John Major's leadership. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was breezily confident that the government would defeat the Labour motion. The motion amounts to a procedural device that would pave the way for a further vote on the implementation of the second tranche of VAT during the passage of the finance bill.</p>

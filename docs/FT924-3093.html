			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bad company reports hit senior bourses NEGATIVE announcements from the corporate sector upset German and French equities yesterday. Milan, Vienna, Madrid and Lisbon were closed for a religious holiday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT closed at its lowest level for nearly a month on the publication of disappointing 10-month results from Deutsche Bank. The DAX index fell 17.08 to 1,508.24 as turnover rose to DM4.1bn from DM3bn. News late on Monday night that Northwest Airlines had cancelled a Dollars 3.5bn order with the Airbus consortium, which includes Daimler, down DM8.60 at DM523, also depressed sentiment. However, Mr Michael Geiger at County NatWest comments that the cancellation of the 74 aircraft represents only 4.5 per cent of the total order book and is therefore unlikely to have serious long-term consequences for the consortium. Deutsche, the last of the big banks to release its figures, had been expected to turn in disappointing earnings but the 5 per cent decline was below many forecasts and the shares dipped DM13.90 or 2 per cent to DM653.10. Commerzbank eased DM2.20 to DM241.80 and Dresdner was DM2.70 lower at DM350.80. Dr Reinhard Fischer, head of German equities at Paribas in London, believes that that overall the banking sector still offers growth potential in 1993. He forecasts earnings growth of some 7 per cent for the banking sector next year, against a rise of 5 per cent for other constituent companies of the DAX index. The engineering group Deutsche Babcock added DM2.30 to DM145.30 on news that earnings would rise in the 1991/92 year and that it hoped to resume dividend payments next year. PARIS was dragged down by Elf which dropped 4.1 per cent following its chairman's profit warning, published after the close on Monday. Elf, one of the most heavily weighted stocks in the CAC-40 index, closed FFr14 lower at FFr332 and the index fell 22.73 or 1.3 per cent to 1,765.88. Turnover was steady at FFr1.9bn. Other losers included Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, down FFr17 or 3.4 per cent at FFr482 on news that it would inject FFr460m into its building subsidiary, Dumez. Havas lost another FFr20 or 4.8 per cent to FFr401 in the wake of its chairman's cautious trading statement on Monday. Euro Disney jumped FFr1.7 or 3 per cent to FFr58.65. The stock has fallen to a record low recently and there were reports that the US broker had bought the shares aggressively yesterday morning as it closed out a bear position. ZURICH closed firmer but below the day's highs as buying in the second round of trading was not sufficient to offset earlier profit-taking on a weaker dollar. The SMI added 7.7 to 1,962.2 after the day's high of 1,967.4. Buying interest centred almost exclusively on blue chips, while second-tier shares were under selling pressure. Ciba registered shares, SFr8 higher at SFr596, topped the active list, followed by Roche PCs, SFr20 firmer at SFr3,950. Schindler bearers fell SFr150 to SFr2,950. AMSTERDAM saw further weakness in cyclicals as the CBS Tendency index closed unchanged at 105.8. Among chemicals, DSM was Fl 1.40 down at Fl 80.50 and Akzo Fl 2.00 lower at Fl 134.70. Rodamco, the country's largest property investment group, shed Fl 1.20 to Fl 46.00 on news that its investment losses had widened in the first nine months. STOCKHOLM rose further as the bourse took its cue from advances on Wall Street. The Affarsvarlden General index added 15.0 or 1.7 per cent to 886.4 in turnover of SKr579m after SKr451m. The industrial group Incentive AB rose another SKr5 to SKr163 on the back of a positive nine-month earnings report and the forecast of improved profits in 1992, Volvo jumped SKr14 to SKr332. The banking sector finished as the day's winner, up 5.8 per cent. S-E Banken rose SKr0.50 to SKr16 while Handelsbanken added SKr1 to SKr33. OSLO fell 1.8 per cent in reaction to recent strong gains fuelled by speculation about a currency devaluation. The all-share index fell 6.68 to 369.53 in thin turnover of NKr183m. Norsk Hydro closed NKr3.5 lower at NKr146.5 while Saga was down NKr1 at NKr66. HELSINKI closed higher for a third consecutive day and the HEX index rose 11.7 to 881.7.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- December 8                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes              Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1053.15   1051.18    1050.05    1049.69 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1133.39   1132.69    1131.45    1132.05  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  Dec 7      Dec 4      Dec 3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100             1056.02    1052.78    1055.11 FT-SE Eurotrack 200             1137.52    1133.53    1136.09  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes              13.00     14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1049.72   1050.90    1051.49    1051.12 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1133.51   1135.21    1136.15    1135.64  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                      Dec 2           Dec 1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100                 1052.11         1056.79 FT-SE Eurotrack 200                 1130.96         1135.62  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1053.29 ; 200 -  1137.21 Low/day: 100 -  1049.00  200 -  1130.63  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

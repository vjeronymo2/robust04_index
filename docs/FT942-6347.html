			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / The dye is cast by growth and costs: European chemicals companies are shifting bulk capacity to Asia The dragon shifted one way, then the other, as it advanced on the Scotsman. The creature twisted, contorting to the sounds of drums and cymbals, the din momentarily overwhelmed by the spatter of fireworks. Then there was silence. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of the UK's top chemicals company, Imperial Chemical Industries, stepped forward. The dragon had warded off the evil spirits that could have jeopardised his company's latest venture: a plant, capable of making 350,000 tonnes a year of pure terephthalic acid, a plastic used mostly in bottles. Sir Denys could now open the Pounds 150m factory in Kuan Yin, Taiwan, with confidence. The ritual was a far cry from ICI's traditional manufacturing centre in the bleak landscape of the River Tees in the north-east of England. The ceremony some months ago heralded a trend in the European chemicals industry as it refines its global strategy, shifting bulk chemicals capacity from the industrial centres of Europe to the rapidly expanding economies of Asia. Sir Denys is not the only European chairman opening plants in Asia. His counterparts from Swiss, German, French and other UK chemicals groups have been investing in locations as diverse as India in the west, Vietnam in the east, China in the north and Jakarta in the south. If successful, the migration could ensure the long-term survival of the European companies. But it raises serious questions about Europe's prospects as a manufacturing base. The reason for the reorientation is Asia's rapid economic growth, explains Mr Ronnie Hampel, ICI chief executive. The buoyancy of the region's economies is having a knock-on effect on the Asian chemicals market which, excluding Japan, grew 8 per cent in 1993, according to BASF, the German group. Such heady progress contrasts with a European chemicals market which recorded zero growth last year. By the end of the decade, the Asian chemicals market, including Japan, will be worth Dollars 500bn a year - about the same as the European or the US market, forecasts BASF. This expansion is being fuelled by the shift of entire sectors to low-cost south-east Asian countries. 'The area enjoys high growth rates in textiles, electronics, and automotive engineering, all of which are significant customers of the chemicals industry,' says Dr Manfred Schneider, chief executive of Bayer. A further factor is that Asian chemicals groups will become serious competitors to the Europeans in the next decade. By shifting production to Asia, the Europeans hope to compete effectively. 'A combination of lower costs and modern technology will enable them (the Asian countries) to become exporters to other parts of the world. Asia's share of world exports of organic dyestuffs grew between 1982 and 1991 - just one decade - from 13 per cent to almost 24 per cent,' says Dr Schneider. Dr Hans-Helge Stechl, BASF board director responsible for Asia, says the company is building a dyestuffs plant in Shanghai that will export to the US and Europe. The group is also constructing a dye plant in Mangalore, western India. Sales growth in south-east Asia has been rapid. Ciba, the Swiss group, has benefited from double-digit growth in turnover in the Asia-Pacific for the past three years. In 1993, more than 16 per cent of group turnover was generated in the region. The company plans to increase that proportion to 20 per cent by the late 1990s. Similarly, Bayer's turnover in the Asia-Pacific area has increased by more than 30 per cent since 1990, and reached DM5.58bn last year, 14 per cent of group sales. Capital investment has followed sales. 'At an early stage we realised it would only be possible to share in the dynamic growth of the market by committing ourselves to local production,' says Dr Stechl. The company had invested DM1.2bn in Asia before 1993, but has a further DM1.8bn committed to new projects in south-east Asia, excluding Japan. It presently invests between 8 per cent and 10 per cent of its capital spending in the region, a figure that is expected to rise to between 15 per cent and 20 per cent over the next few years, according to Dr Stechl. For ICI, capital for investment over the past three years has been in short supply. But Asia remains a priority, says Mr Hampel. Last year, the company spent more on capital projects in the Asia-Pacific than in the UK, continental Europe or the US. Most European investment is being put into the fast-growing Chinese market, which could be worth as much as Dollars 100bn by the year 2000, the same size as Germany. BASF, which has five joint ventures in China, hopes to have sales of DM1bn by the end of the decade. Ciba of Switzerland has also set China as its priority in the region and has invested Dollars 200m there. One country not benefiting from investment into Asia is Japan. Apart from a plant to make replacements for ozone-depleting CFCs used in refrigeration and air-conditioning, opened by ICI this year, little European money is being invested by chemicals companies in the region's largest economy. This is partly because of the recession. But the strong yen, high manufacturing costs, and the migration of the electronics and automotive industries to low-cost centres elsewhere in Asia, have also contributed. While European chemicals companies are being lured to the rest of Asia, at the same time they are being driven away from their home bases by high costs and what manufacturers perceive as an ever-tightening regulatory stranglehold. Dr Schneider warns: 'The main disadvantages we have to face are higher labour costs and expensive social security systems, coupled with widespread regulation of environmental affairs by the state. We have to overcome these handicaps. If we do not, many areas of our business (in Europe) will become uncompetitive and therefore in danger of being squeezed out of the market.' Dr Stechl agrees. 'High costs in the established countries are forcing producers to take evasive action, moving to countries where labour and capital expenditure costs offer a more favourable economic framework.' Labour costs in Taiwan are 21 per cent of those in western Germany; those in Singapore and Hong Kong are 20 and 16 per cent respectively, according to Bayer. The consequences of this evasive action are clear. Last year, for the third year running, capital investment by the chemicals industry in Europe fell, down 14.3 per cent. Employment continues to decline: since 1990, the number of jobs in the sector has fallen by 160,000, according to the European Chemical Industry Council, which predicts a further drop of 60,000 this year. The prospects for Europe as a manufacturing centre for bulk chemicals is grim. While Asia offers the chance to escape from the low-growth lethargic markets of Europe, industry leaders warn that significant profits could prove elusive in the short-term. The reality of doing business is challenging, says Sir Denys. Industrial relations, taxation and foreign exchange problems all pose difficulties, he says. Some companies have had to pull out. Hoechst, for example, withdrew from its foray into South Korea - a joint venture with Lucky Goldstar - because of lack of profitability. 'Anyone who thinks the streets of Asia are paved with gold needs to have his illusions shattered. It's bloody hard work,' Sir Denys adds. It looks as if ICI will be using the services of dragons for some time to come.

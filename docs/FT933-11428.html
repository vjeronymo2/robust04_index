			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: Ford's earnings double to Dollars 775m on strong US sales FORD Motor, the second-largest US car manufacturer, yesterday reported doubled second-quarter earnings as stronger US vehicle sales and surging financial services profits outweighed problems in the European market. Ford reported earnings of Dollars 775m, or Dollars 1.43 a share, up from Dollars 387m, or 70 cents, in the same period of last year. Sales and revenues rose to Dollars 29.4bn from Dollars 26.8bn. Mr Harold Poling, the chairman, said the improvement, in the midst of weak economies and the company's aggressive product introduction programme, showed 'we remain on course for better financial results in 1993 over last year'. However, he noted that in Europe most leading economies continued to worsen during the quarter, and added: 'I'm not sure we have seen the bottom there yet'. Ford's US automotive operations earned Dollars 367m, up from Dollars 42m a year ago, due to increased industry sales and increased market share. It held 21.4 per cent of the US car market, up 0.5 of a point from a year ago, while its light truck share was up 0.3 of a point at 30.2 per cent. Outside the US, automotive operations earned Dollars 28m, down from Dollars 61m a year ago, due to weakness in Europe, where the company doubted it would make profits this year. The group's financial services company earned record profits of Dollars 380m, up from Dollars 284m a year ago, which was attributed mainly to increased volume and reduced credit losses. For the six months, Ford reported net income of Dollars 1.35bn, or Dollars 2.45, compared to a loss after accounting changes of Dollars 6.27bn, or Dollars 13.13 in the same period of 1992. Sales rose to Dollars 56.18bn from Dollars 51.4bn.</p>

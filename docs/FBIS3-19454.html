			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Course Set for EU Entry"] </F>   [Excerpt] In the view of the federal government, foreign  and security policy and economic reasons speak for Austria's  accession to the European Union [EU]. This was emphasized by  the federal government in its report on the result of the EU  negotiations, which was adopted by the Cabinet and passed on to  parliament on Wednesday [16 March].    With a special Cabinet meeting in parliament, the federal  government has set the course for a referendum on Austrian EU  membership. Federal Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and Foreign  Minister Alois Mock presented the results of the Brussels  negotiations to the Cabinet in the form of a report. Moreover,  agreement was reached in the coalition on the text of the short  constitutional amendment on accession, which will form the basis  of the referendum to be held after the relevant resolution is  adopted by parliament. As a result of the extra Cabinet  meeting, these bills could be tabled in yesterday's  parliamentary session, and can, thus, be passed on to the  responsible committees.    The government report notes that "European integration is  and  always has primarily been a basis for security policy." This  has proved its worth over more than 40 years. Now "Austria also  has the chance to join this area of stability and peace and to  participate in its shaping."    Since the end of the Cold War, the European Community, apart  from its traditional economic leadership, has assumed a key role  for securing stability in all of Europe. The necessity for  efficient foreign and security policy at the level of the Union  is becoming more and more obvious.    The following is a quote from the introductory paragraph of  the government report: "However, the crisis-like developments  of the recent period, particularly the nationalist conflicts in  East and southeast Europe, and the problems resulting from the  change of system in the new democracies also indicate the  difficulties regarding the development of a stable European  peace system and the enormous dangers for Europe that would  result from a failure of these efforts. As a result of its  location at the fringe of the European `area of turbulence,'  Austria has a vital interest that the EU effectively meets its  responsibility for the stability of all of Europe. Membership  in the EU would offer Austria the opportunity to voice its  specific concerns in the Union's joint policymaking, and, on the  basis of equality, to have a say in those decisions that will  determine Europe's, and thus also Austria's, future."    The federal government emphasizes that only full integration  of Austria into the process of European integration can ensure  "Austria's comprehensive participation in the economic  developments of Europe." The effects of European recession,  which have also been felt in Austria, show "the limited  possibilities a medium-sized European country has if its wants  to fight economic crisis phenomena by itself." Just as economic  setbacks, structural disadvantages of competition, and mass  unemployment are European phenomena in an era of  interdependency, "the countermeasures" must also "be coordinated  at this level."    In 29 chapters spread over some 80 pages, the government  report offers a detailed representation of the results achieved  by Austria in the negotiations in Brussels.    The draft amendment on accession comprises 16 pages. It is  based on the assumption that the membership agreement must be  seen as an amendment to the federal Constitution. The amendment  should "expressly authorize the conclusion of this treaty, which  is why it has to be subject to a referendum under Article 44,  Section 3 of the federal Constitutional after it was adopted by  parliament."    The joint Cabinet statement by the federal chancellor and  the  foreign minister points out that, "with the exception of  Chapters 23 (economic and monetary policy) and 28  (institutions), the EU negotiations have been concluded. These  two areas, which primarily deal with overcoming antagonisms  within the EU, should be concluded in the very near future. For  technical reasons, the editing work for the conclusion of the  membership agreement will take some more time."    It was expressly stated that the comprehensive report on the  membership negotiations was released early, on the one hand to  provide detailed information quickly and, on the other, to give  parliament the opportunity for detailed discussions against the  background of the result achieved in the negotiations.    Without yesterday's Cabinet meeting, legislation could not  have been introduced in parliament before 6 April. As far as  the referendum is concerned there are still two possible days --  12 or 19 June. After the Cabinet meeting, Chancellor Franz  Vranitzky said that the day would be determined depending on the  preparatory work and the decision by the European Parliament.  As an additional document, the Austrian parliament will also  receive the report of the European Council of Ministers to the  European Parliament. [passage omitted]</p>

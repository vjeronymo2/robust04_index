			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BASEBALL STAR RETURNS TO CLASS  </P> <P> John Olerud has returned to classes at Washington State University after  undergoing an operation two weeks ago to repair an aneurysm near the base of  his brain.  </P> <P> The standout baseball player has resumed light workouts to rebuild his strength  but is not expected to rejoin the baseball team in the near future.  </P> <P> "The main thing is John is back in school and everything is going to be all  right," WSU baseball coach Bobo Brayton said. "Baseball is going to be around  for quite some time, and we're just happy that John is going to be here too."  </P> <P> Olerud, a junior pitcher and first baseman who was named college baseball  Player of the Year in 1988 by Baseball America magazine, is "feeling great,"  according to his father, Dr. John Olerud. But the elder Olerud, a professor at  the University of Washington Medical School, said it's still not been  determined yet whether his son will be able to play for the Cougars later this  season.  </P></p>

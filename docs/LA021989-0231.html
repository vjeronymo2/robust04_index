			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KEEPING A SECRET;  </P> <P> ROCKWELL'S NEW 'STAR WARS' FACILITY IN SEAL BEACH IS DESIGNED TO FOIL SPIES  </P> <P> Inside Building No. 90, a portable radio blares rock music as construction  workers put the finishing touches on the most secretive defense plant ever  built by Rockwell International Corp.  </P> <P> The sound of Bob Seger seems somehow incongruous with the serious purpose of  this $30-million structure: the development of top-secret plans for the "Star  Wars" missile-defense program.  </P> <P> The nearly completed four-story structure at Rockwell's Seal Beach facility is  the centerpiece of the company's effort to land lucrative "Star Wars"  contracts. Called the Strategic Defense Center, it is also part of an ambitious  corporate experiment aimed at finding a better way to manage large, complex  programs.  </P> <P> Although the future of the controversial "Star Wars" program is far from  certain, Rockwell is convinced that its investment in the Strategic Defense  Center will be money well spent.  </P> <P> Rockwell executives believe that in one form or another, "Star Wars" technology  will be around for a long time. Like earlier space programs, they said, the  research effort is expected to serve as the engine for many new technological  breakthroughs with applications for other projects at the $12-billion aerospace  and defense firm.  </P> <P> Rockwell has assembled at the center a group consisting of hundreds of top  engineers, scientists and computer experts -- many of whom were teamed together  on the Apollo space program 2 decades ago. About 1,000 people will work at the  center when it is fully staffed.  </P> <P> The personnel assigned to the center will come mostly from Rockwell's other  divisions throughout Southern California, where the company employs 35,000  people.  </P> <P> They will work inside a mostly windowless facility with an array of security  precautions reminiscent of scenes from a spy thriller.  </P> <P> The building is a bewildering maze of stark hallways, soundproof rooms and  offices protected by high-security locks, infrared sensors and double layers of  doors. In the most sensitive areas, offices are protected by huge steel doors  like those used in bank vaults.  </P> <P> The floor, ceiling and walls are extra-thick and loaded with special materials  to prevent radio or computer transmissions from escaping outside, where they  might be intercepted by spies using sophisticated electronic equipment.  </P> <P> Air-conditioning ducts have been sealed off to prevent intruders from crawling  their way into trouble. And telephone lines have been secured.  </P> <P> Nothing, it seems, has been taken for granted. Even a simple thing like  reminding employees to close a door behind them warrants a sign reading:  "Please verify door is closed. For door problems, please call immediately."  Construction workers had to undergo security checks to ensure they didn't plant  eavesdropping devices in the building. That precaution was taken to prevent a  replay of what happened at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. Last year, former  President Reagan ordered the partially completed embassy torn down and  reconstructed because the building's Soviet-made concrete casings were found to  be riddled with listening devices.  </P> <P> Access to some areas of the Rockwell facility is so difficult that center  director George W. Jeffs, even with the use of a map, had difficulty locating  the "battle management" program offices during a recent tour with a Times  reporter.  </P> <P> The battle management program involves the development of computer systems to  manage a "Star Wars" system. The battle management area includes large computer  displays in which a "Star Wars" scenario could be simulated.  </P> <P> The center's main purpose will be to oversee Rockwell's work on the "Star Wars"  program, formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative.  </P> <P> El Segundo-based Rockwell was the nation's fourth-largest SDI contractor in  1988 and has current contracts totaling $778 million.  </P> <P> "Star Wars" is a proposed space-based, anti-missile system designed to act as  both a shield and deterrent to a Soviet nuclear attack. Viewed by supporters as  a strategic necessity and by critics as the ultimate boondoggle, billions of  research dollars have been poured into the program during the past 6 years.  Some of the program's prototype systems are beginning to undergo tests, but a  decision about deployment is years away.  </P> <P> A number of Orange County defense contractors are getting a piece of the "Star  Wars" action, including McDonnell Douglas Corp. in Huntington Beach, Hughes  Aircraft Co. in Fullerton and Interstate Electronics Corp. in Anaheim.  </P> <P> Rockwell is a prime contractor on one of the centerpiece projects for "Star  Wars," the Space-Based Interceptor program. That project involves a satellite  designed to fire high-energy projectiles known as "smart rocks" at ballistic  missiles, destroying them by the speed and force of impact. The company's other  programs include electronic sensors, high-energy lasers and computer systems to  manage a "Star Wars" battle.  </P> <P> The Space-Based Interceptor program was threatened last year after the Defense  Acquisition Board issued an unfavorable review of the program, saying it would  cost too much. However, recent changes in the design of the program have  lowered its proposed costs from $52 billion to $17.7 billion.  </P> <P> Rockwell's investment in the new facility, which is expected to grow to $50  million over the next few years, is "a practical effort to help us marshal our  resources from throughout the corporation," said Jeffs, the center's director  and Rockwell's executive vice president for strategic defense and technologies.  </P> <P> The center represents "a new adventure in management," said Jeffs, a 42-year  veteran of Rockwell who headed the company's work on the Apollo, Skylab and  Space Shuttle programs. The center is unique, he said, because it is Rockwell's  first attempt to the centralize management of programs involving many different  divisions. Eight Rockwell units are presently involved in "Star Wars"-related  activities.  </P> <P> "In the past, we would try to do projects out of a particular division," Jeffs  said. "But the expertise of any one division might not be the best of fits for  a given job. We can tailor this organization to better match the requirements  of some of the new jobs that don't fall naturally within the business structure  of our existing divisions."  </P> <P> By locating key personnel from various Rockwell units under a single roof, the  corporation also hopes to foster a team spirit and eliminate problems of  inter-division rivalries. "Co-locating people tends to totally eliminate the  parochial self-interest" of any one division, a Rockwell official explained.  </P> <P> The center will perform program management, research, design and engineering  work for various "Star Wars" systems. But the production of test hardware will  be done at different Rockwell units, including Seal Beach and Anaheim in Orange  County.  </P> <P> Unlike other Rockwell operations, the center won't be evaluated on the basis of  how much it contributes to the corporation's bottom line. It will function as a  "nonprofit" facility, with all profits gained from programs managed at the  center being credited to the Rockwell division that performs the bulk of the  work.  </P> <P> Rockwell is promoting the center as the first of its kind devoted solely to  "Star Wars" programs. Company executives believe the center's high-security  features will prove attractive to its security-conscious customers at the  Pentagon, providing Rockwell with a potential leg up on its competitors.  </P> <P> When the company began construction of the center in May, 1987, plans called  for a two-story, 100,000-square-foot structure -- half the size of what has  been built. The building was designed so that two additional floors could be  added later.  </P> <P> "We very quickly realized the building size wouldn't match our requirements,"  Jeffs said. "We concluded that from an overall point of view, it would be more  economical to finish the other two stories now rather than add on to it later."  </P> <P> The Seal Beach site was chosen because it is close to several other "Star Wars"  projects under way at the company's Satellite Systems Division and computer  center, also in Seal Beach.  </P> <P> Although the center was designed specifically for SDI work, Jeffs said the  facility could be used for future classified projects if the controversial  "Star Wars" program encounters political problems in the years ahead.  </P> <P> Jeffs said he believes that the "Star Wars" program "for one reason or another,  will continue for a long period of time."  </P> <P> "We feel that SDI is a good technology driver, just like the Apollo program  was," Jeffs said. "It offers the possibility of a number of spinoffs" to other  military and commercial businesses in which Rockwell is involved.  </P></p>

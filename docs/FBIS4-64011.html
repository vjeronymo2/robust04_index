			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Minister of Justice Yuriy Kalmykov and  Azerbaijani Minister of Justice Ilyas Izmailov signed a state  treaty on transfer of prisoners for punishment in Moscow today.    In accordance with this document foreigners convicted for  crimes will have an opportunity to undergo the appropriate  punishment in their native land. The treaty underlined that a  prisoner can be transferred only if he agreed to.    Izmailov told journalists that about 400 Azerbaijan citizens  were undergoing punishment on Russian territory. Approximately  the same number of Russians have been imprisoned in Azerbaijan.    Izmailov emphasized that the treaty would not concern those  sentenced to death. He said that the treaty aimed at bringing  those convicted back to a normal life, which was impossible in a  foreign country.    Kalmykov stated that Russia intended to sign similar  treaties  with Moldova and Ukraine. He pointed out that Russia stood for  the development of juridical relations between the CIS states in  what concerned not only criminal but also civil and family cases.    The Russian-Azerbaijani treaty requires ratification by the  parliaments. It will come into effect thirty days after  ratification.</p>

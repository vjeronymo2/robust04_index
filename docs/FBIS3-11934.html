The "Cheesebread Republic" is no longer the same. The debate  on the economic plan in Congress has broken up the Juiz de Fora  group and shown who is holding the ball now: Minister of Finance  Fernando Henrique Cardoso. The president's friends from Juiz de  Fora no longer meet around the chief's desk late every afternoon  for cheesebread and a bit of chitchat. Itamar is enthusiastic  about his minister of finance's performance in getting the plan  approved and has caused his friends to lose the influence they  once exercised on government decisions. They still have power,  but they no longer act as a bloc. Each one has started tending  his own garden. Minister Henrique Hargreaves, the leader of the  "Republic of Juiz de Fora," is back in command of the Civilian  Household (see the end of this article). His sister Ruth  Hargreaves manages the presidential temper with patient work  that pleases the president. Physician Saulo Moreira is waiting  resignedly for the administration to come to an end. Attorney  Jose de Castro, the president of Telerj, wanders around Brasilia  acting like someone uninformed, although in fact he is much  better informed than ever. And Minister Mauro Durante is  worrying about the future.    The collapse of the Juiz de Fora group coincided with  Fernando Henrique's ballet for getting the plan approved. Two  weeks ago, Itamar was in his office talking to his old friend  Raul Belem, leader of the PP [Progressive Party] in the Chamber  of Deputies, and former Minister of Finance Eliseu Resende. At  one point, Belem ventured a comment: "Itamar, just look at how  things are. Inflation is rising steadily, interest rates are way  up there, and Fernando Henrique has the support of the media and  prestige in Congress." Then, looking to the side, he added: "If  only it had been that way with you, eh, Eliseu?" The former  minister was realistic: "Oh, I was at the end of my rope, Raul,"  Eliseu said. A pleased president chimed in: "You are right.  Fernando is incredible. Incredible. He is very competent." So  far, Itamar's friends have not shown signs of envying Fernando  Henrique his power. "We all know our limitations now," says  Minister of Planning Alexis Stepanenko, a member of the Juiz de  Fora group by adoption. "That's good because we can do a better  job with the work before us." Senator Pedro Simon, the  government leader, has noticed the change in the president's  conversations. "He is talking to more people," Simon says.    Dull life--Now that the Republic of Juiz de Fora has fallen  apart, some of Itamar's friends have lost interest in power, and  others are tending to their duties in the corridors of the  palace. Spokesman Francisco Baker is leaving the administration  at the end of this month to work as adviser to the IMF in  Washington, where he will earn $5,000 per month. Physician Saulo  Moreira, in charge of the policy for reducing the price of  medicines, is counting the days until this administration ends.  "I'm going crazy waiting to get out of this" is the scornful  phrase frequently repeated around the palace. Former  presidential adviser Thales de Souza Ramos, an anesthesiologist,  no longer has a guaranteed seat at Planalto Palace. Immediately  after Itamar took office, Thales spent a long period in Brasilia  and then was asked to return on several occasions. Now he almost  never leaves Minas Gerais, and he rarely meets with Itamar. "I  would rather keep on drinking beer with friends in Juiz de Fora  than put up with that boring life in Brasilia," he once  commented.    Among those who are still active, special adviser Ruth  Hargreaves has seen her influence grow. A friend and confidante  of Itamar's, she keeps the chief in a good mood. On Wednesday  the 2d, when Congress failed to approve the Emergency Social  Fund, Itamar was furious. Ruth immediately went into action to  calm him down. "Don't worry," she said. "I've heard that the  PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] is going to vote for  it." Playing coy, attorney Jose de Castro let it be known that  he was not informed. But he was. Last week he landed in Brasilia  and followed a well-informed agenda with absolute discretion. He  talked to the president, held a secret meeting with Sao Paulo  Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho, and held a lengthy  conversation with Minister Fernando Henrique about the  introduction of the URV [expansion not given]. Minister Mauro  Durante is another presidential friend whose influence with the  president has increased recently as he has filled the vacuum  left by the departure of Hargreaves. But he is worried about his  future means of livelihood. "All it will take is a stroke of the  pen by Lula, and I will no longer have a means of supporting my  family," the minister confided to a friend. Durante, an attorney  from Embrapa who was hired under the CLT [Consolidated Labor  Laws], can be fired by the administration at any time. "We need  to start thinking about the future," the minister was told by  his friend Osiris Lopes Filho, whom he had appointed to the  Federal Tax Office. One adviser at Planalto Palace says: "Itamar  may arrange a lifetime position for him, perhaps by appointing  him to a vacant judgeship, before this administration ends."    Astral: Itamar himself already regards the current phase of  his administration as being the last. "I am absolutely convinced  that this administration will end on 3 October," he told a  friend during a conversation at the end of January. "From then  on, the country will have two presidents, and my job will be to  manage the transition." In view of Fernando Henrique's  popularity, some of Itamar's friends are concerned about showing  who possesses the presidential sash. They want the president to  do more traveling around the country and be seen with the  people. Itamar is scheduled to spend Carnival in an improvised  theater box on Marques de Sapucai Street in Rio de Janeiro, from  where he will watch the Mangueira parade. Then he plans to visit  Rio Grande do Sul and Sao Paulo. Minister Elcio Alvares had  another idea. He is organizing a dinner with the president for  the ministers, since Itamar has abandoned tedious routine  business. The president currently meets with ministers only when  something specific needs to be dealt with. "In practice, the  economy is now being run by Fernando Henrique's team, not the  president, who works with the minister to formulate general  guidelines," says one of the ministers. According to another  adviser, Itamar has finally acquired the notion of limits. "More  than just learning what a president can do, he has realized what  he will not be able to do, with the result that he is free of  the anxiety that existed at the beginning."    While his Juiz de Fora friends scatter and others try to  make  him look more like a president, Itamar Franco has started living  on an astral plane. He leaves his office earlier than before: at  around 2030 rather than 2300 as formerly. He has stopped eating  with advisers at Planalto Palace and now leaves every day to  have lunch at home: at Alvorada Palace. He no longer becomes  irritated at criticism of the government while watching the news  on television, and he has even started calling his former  girlfriend, Lisle Lucena, again. Pleased with the approval of  Fernando Henrique's second economic plan, Itamar is happy with a  poll whose results will soon be released. It shows that the  figures on his first year in Planalto Palace are much better  than Collor's. But inflation, which has doubled under his  administration, is the most negative feature of his  administration (see the table).    The only episode to spoil the president's good mood last  week  was a health problem. According to an announcement by Carlos  Alberto Oliveira Faria, Planalto Palace's official physician,  Itamar suffered food poisoning after eating a chicken potpie at  Alvorada Palace. The person who brought the potpie to the  president's table claims that the tidbit was in perfect  condition and very tasty besides. At around 1030 on Sunday, the  president went out to read the newspapers beside the swimming  pool at Alvorada Palace and went to sleep in the sun for an  hour. He ended up with heatstroke.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |The Figures on Itamar                                                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Description              |Collor (1992)            |Itamar (1993)            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Gross domestic product (-|-0.9                     |5.0                      |  |percent)                 |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Industrial production (p-|-3.6                     |9.0                      |  |ercent)                  |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |International reserves ($|23.0                     |33.0                     |  | billions)               |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Foreign investment ($ bi-|2.8                      |7.0                      |  |llions)                  |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |New loans ($ billions)   |7.9                      |10.0                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Yield from privatization |2.3                      |3.0                      |  |($ billions)             |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Vehicle production (mill-|1.0                      |1.4                      |  |ions of units)           |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Roads repaired (kilomete-|1,400.0                  |6,600.0                  |  |rs)                      |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Inflation (percent)      |1,174.0                  |2,567.0                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Source: Special Office for Intergovernmental Communication, Office of the Pr-|  |esident of the Republic.                                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |President Itamar Franco is pleased with the results of his first year in off-|  |ice.

Hargreaves left the Civilian Household 101 days ago after being  accused of involvement in the Congress budget scandal. Since  nothing against him was proven, Hargreaves took office again  before a single witness last Tuesday. The minister stationed  himself beside the bed of President Itamar Franco, who was  recuperating in Alvorada Palace, and signed the book making him  chief of the Civilian Household. Soul cleansed, he postponed the  ceremony until later, when a party held in Planalto Palace  included the popping of 14 bottles of French champagne. "I would  not say that I was depressed because of my departure. My feeling  was one of bitterness," Hargreaves said.    At 57 years of age, married, and with two children, the  minister, who was once a sergeant in the Army, resented his  forced removal from power. After being accustomed to meeting up  to 40 congressmen in his office every day and answering an equal  number of telephone calls, Hargreaves suddenly found himself  alone and being visited only by a few friends. One of them was  President Itamar himself, who telephoned Hargreaves a few times  and visited him on five occasions. During one of those visits,  Hargreaves was invited to return to the administration. He  accepted immediately. During his hibernation, he had gone on a  diet and lost five kilograms, which he has now duly regained,  and even contacted future clients with a view to reopening his  law office in Brasilia.    Arrogant--Hargreaves always retained a thread of hope that  he  would return to power. Mainly because Itamar, besides showing  him friendly support, never actually installed his successor,  Tarcisio Cunha. "It was a good time for me to engage in some  self-criticism," the minister says. "I feel that I made a lot of  mistakes; I was quite arrogant, but I have come back a changed  man." All that remains is to convince his opponents. Last week,  a direct adviser to the president was already spreading venom  over the minister's return. He said that during his first period  in Planalto Palace, Hargreaves had been one of the ministers  making the most use of government jets, mainly on Fridays.</p>

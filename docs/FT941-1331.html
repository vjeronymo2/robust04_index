			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Maunders rises on more normal trading A return to more normal trading conditions enabled John Maunders Group, the Manchester-based housebuilder, to report pre-tax profits for the six months to December 31 more than doubled at Pounds 3.03m, against a restated Pounds 1.4m. Mr John Maunders, chairman, said that the result had also been helped by management changes and the implementation of tighter cost controls. Turnover rose to Pounds 33.5m (Pounds 23.9m) with completions rising to 489 units (363) at an average selling price of Pounds 68,500 (Pounds 65,900). Operating margins improved to 10.25 per cent, compared with 8.54 per cent in the second half of the previous year. The pre-tax figure was struck after net interest charges of Pounds 406,000 (Pounds 834,000) and gearing at the period end was 34 per cent. Earnings per share came out at 8.18p (3.79p) and the interim dividend is being raised to 2.45p (2.3p).</p>

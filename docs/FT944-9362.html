			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / 'Sleaze' judge refuses to be swayed by PM's views Lord Nolan, the judge heading the committee of inquiry into standards of conduct in public life, has made clear that he will not be swayed by the prime minister's view that MPs should continue to have the right to enjoy outside business interests. As the government tries to recover from allegations of 'sleaze' against senior Tory MPs, Lord Nolan has said that Mr John Major's views on this are to be regarded as a personal expression which stand alongside those of any MP. Mr Major said in his Mansion House speech on Monday night that parliament emphasised that Britain 'would not benefit from a monastic Commons' and that politicians 'must know how this world works'. Lord Nolan is understood to have told committee members that Mr Major's views should not sway their examination of whether MPs should have business interests. He has not ruled out the possibility that the prime minister could be summoned to give evidence to the committee. The Nolan committee agreed yesterday to produce an interim report into its activities before the end of the year. The committee is examining written submissions from members of the public. Lord Nolan also agreed to set up three separate sub-committees to examine the activities of MPs, the ability of ministers and civil servants to move to private companies, and appointments to quangos. Mr Tom King, the former Northern Ireland secretary, is among the three committee members examining whether former ministers can move to the private sector, in spite of his declaration in the register of members' interests of directorships. Lord Nolan is understood to believe that there is no conflict of interest in this.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Positive outcome for Chiroscience drug trial Chiroscience, the Cambridge biotechnology company, has had positive results from its first set of clinical trials since its flotation in February. The phase one trial was conducted on 14 young, healthy male volunteers and compared Chiroscience's purified form of an existing anaesthetic with the established version. The purified version 'demonstrated that it has a higher tolerability', said Mr John Padfield, chief executive. 'It also demonstrated its efficacy.' Chiroscience purifies drugs that are sold as a mixture of two virtually identical chemical structures. By separating the two structures it hopes to eliminate one that produces more side effects or is less effective. The approach should also cut the time taken for a drug in trials to be approved because much of the work needed for approval has already been done with the mixture. The trials were on a purified version of the long acting local anaesthetic bupivacaine called levobupivacaine. It is usually used for women in childbirth as an epidural. Mr Padfield said that independent industry figures showed the global market to be worth about Dollars 100m (Pounds 68m) a year. It is supplied in the UK by Astra, the Swedish company, under the brand name Marcain. However, the potential market for levobupivacaine is substantially greater than this given 'improved safety profile and possible additional indications such as cancer pain,' said Mr Padfield. 'Levobupivacaine also has potential applications in day surgery where a safer, long-acting agent could encourage an increased number of long surgical procedures to be carried out under regional rather than general anaesthesia,' he said.</p>

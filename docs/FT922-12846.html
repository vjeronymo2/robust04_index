			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Survey of Seville and World Expo '92 (6): Aztec memories - Mexico has mixed feelings MEXICO'S tortured feelings about its conquest by Spain and relations with the once colonial power have been sorely tested by the celebrations of Columbus's 'discovery' of the Americas. Almost as soon as the Spaniards formed their preparatory committee to organise the celebration, Mexicans and other Latin Americans objected. The Americas were not discovered, they pointed out - rather there was a 'meeting of two worlds'. The 500th anniversary, they said, should not be a celebration, but a commemoration. Even this is too benign a description for many. The brutal conquest of Mexico and the subsequent annihilation (through disease) of most of the indigenous population, could hardly be described as a 'meeting'. In Mexico, indigenous leaders will celebrate 'the day of the race' (as it is called) by taking wreaths from the statue of Columbus and laying them at the foot of the last Aztec Emperor, Cuauhtemoc. Mexico's ambassador to Spain, Jesus Silva Herzog, in a recent interview with the newspaper La Journada, went to some considerable effort to explain Mexico's position: 'Our pavilion in the Seville fair is going to show the world that Mexico did not begin in 1492, that before the Spanish arrived we were already an important group of nations, with a city, Tenochtitlan, that was probably larger than whatever European city of that era. And now we desire and hope to place ourself in a world forum with a dynamic project, equally multiethnic, multiracial, multicultural, that shows we are more than 30 centuries old, and not a mere 500 years old.' Such defensiveness is understandable. The typical Mexican when asked about Hernan Cortes, who conquered Aztec Mexico with a few hundred soldiers, will say he was a brutal blood-thirsty mercenary - far from the hero many in Spain portray him to be. While in Peru statutes of their conqueror, Francisco Pizarro, abound, Mexico City sports none of Cortes. Mexico's attitude to the 500th anniversary is complicated by the hope many Mexican intellectuals have that it will force the country to confront its colonial past, and come to terms with its mestizaje (mixed-blood heritage). Carlos Fuentes, the writer, has renewed an old controversy by suggesting the city build a statute to Cortes. As he said 'I wish we could have a statue of Hernan Cortes on his horse so that we could end the complex of having been colonised. I believe this is more honest; we must accept our mother and father.' Such views are echoed by other intellectuals, who, as a group, form a strangely important role in Mexican society. In a television debate on the meaning of 1492, Enrique Florescano, a respected historian, made an impassioned plea. 'The (historical) interpretations that developed during the period of Mexican nationalism cut off our colonial past; the result is we have not been able to incorporate the huge impact of its politics, religion, culture and science on our history, which has created an identity crisis. We have to use their 500th anniversary to re-evaluate our history.' Others present disagreed, claiming Mexico has a perfectly strong sense of national identity. Mr Fuentes's proposal has similarly been roundly condemned. The philosopher Leopoldo Zea called the idea 'an offence and act of idolatry'. The writer Carlos Monsivais joined the fray saying 'it is one thing to suppress unnecessary quarrels, and quite another to provoke them with stone and bronze'. Indigenous peoples (about 10 per cent of the population), and perhaps a majority of the mestizos (mixed-bloods) are understandably concerned that a statue to Cortes would symbolically suggest approval for his brutal conquest, and primacy for the Spanish part of the country's heritage. Mexico's confused relationship with Cortes (and by implication with its mixed-blood heritage) has had a profound effect on its relations with Spain. For most of the 19th century relations were frosty, as Mexico struggled to assert its independence. In the 20th century Mexico broke off relations with General Franco's Spain, and welcomed some 40,000 republican exiles to its shores. Alan Riding in his book Distant Neighbours writes (going perhaps too far) that Franco 'had come to signify Cortes' who by breaking off of relations 'could be symbolically punished'. Since then Mexico and Spain have grown closer, especially under Felipe Gonzalez and Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Members of Mr Salinas's cabinet are said to be deeply impressed by Spain's 'transition' since Franco's death, and are keen to emulate a similar type of transition themselves - even if Mexico's situation is strikingly different. Hence, just as Spain joined the European Community in the belief that economic integration would fuel growth, capital inflows, and promote political stability, Mexico has sought membership of a North American free trade area for similar reasons. Spain has recently replaced France as Mexico's closest political partner in the EC. Mr Gonzalez and President Salinas have cooperated closely over policy to Cuba, while Spain offered help during the El Salvador peace talks. (In the early 1980s, by contrast, France and Mexico had cooperated closely over Central American policy.) Spain, eager to make up for past insults, has showered Mexico (and the rest of Latin America) with trade credits, and promises of cooperation. The annual Ibero-American summit, held last year for the first time in Mexico, and to be hosted this year in Spain, aims to strengthen these links still further. Mexico and Latin America hope (rather forlornly) that Spain will promote its interests in the European Community, just as Britain and France won trade concessions for former colonies. Spain in turns wants to build a foothold in the import-hungry Latin American economies. Already Spain's airline, Iberia, has become an Ibero-American carrier, with stakes in the airlines of Venezuela and Argentina. Two Spanish banks have bought stakes in Mexican banks; Spanish investment in Cuban tourism is vital to the island's battered economy. But in spite of the rhetoric of Ibero-American integration, the chances of deeper cooperation are limited. Spain's future clearly lies in Europe, and it is much too concerned about becoming a first-rank member of the EC to waste energy on promoting Latin America to other countries. Indeed, Spain's investment in Mexico is behind that of France, Germany, Japan, Switzerland and the UK, suggesting, if anything, Spain could learn from other European countries about doing business amongst its former colonies. Similarly, the future of Latin America (Cuba apart) evidently lies with the US. The US political and commercial presence is and always will be substantially larger than Spain's. In Mexico, for example, accumulated Spanish investment up to August 1991 was a paltry Dollars 726m, compared to the US investment of Dollars 20.7bn. In recognition of the economic reality, Mexico, and the rest of Latin America, are queueing up to form free trade agreements with the US. Spain lags far behind in their priorities.

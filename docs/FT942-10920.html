			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Books: Noble through a nightmare time - Whatever his defects, Churchill deserves better than this book CHURCHILL by Clive Ponting Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 20, 900 pages There has never been much dispute that if it had not been for the second world war, Winston Churchill would have gone down as a political also-ran. Having entered Parliament at the beginning of the century, he was overtly over-ambitious, an uncomfortable colleague in any cabinet, changed party not once but twice, had a string of mistakes and lost causes behind him and a habit of losing his seat in elections. There is not much to be said for his performance after the war either. He sulked at the Conservative Party's defeat in the general election of 1945, though the result was more due to social change than a personal judgment on him. Thereafter he stayed too long as party leader. He returned as prime minister when the Conservatives won the election of 1951 and spent much of the next few years resisting advice from colleagues and friends to retire. The new post-war conservatism owed little to him. Only recently, however, have attacks begun on Churchill's conduct of the war. Clive Ponting, the former civil servant who fell out with the ministry of defence over the Belgrano affair in the Falklands War, lays it on with a shovel. For Ponting, Churchill the war leader was no better than Churchill the peacetime politician: selfish, inconsistent and often plain wrong. If one accepts the initial premise that Churchill was a bad man to start with, the argument is carefully built up. The chapters on the second world war occupy less than a quarter of a book of 900 pages; the section on Churchill after 1945 is perfunctory. The wartime prime minister has already been condemned by his words and actions before 1940, and the condemnation is not only political. Here is an example of Ponting's style: 'Churchill was also not a particularly attractive figure. He was below average height (five feet six inches tall), with a large head (balding from an early age), a small hairless chest, small hands and feet, a less pronounced version of his father's large staring eyes, and smooth, soft skin (which he wrapped in silk underwear and bathed twice a day).' Before that we have learned that Churchill 'never travelled on a bus in his life, and travelled on the underground on only one occasion, when he promptly got lost.' The sneering goes on. Ponting has further defects as a historian. He quotes selectively. He suggests that Sir John Colville, Churchill's wartime private secretary, and Sir Alexander Cadogan, the head of the Foreign Office, were wholly critical of their political master. Quotations to the contrary are omitted. Ponting commits the historian's cardinal error. He condemns the past by the standards of the present. Churchill was not alone in regarding Kenya as a white man's country, nor in believing non-whites to be inferior; he was very largely a man of his time. Sometimes sources are given, sometimes not. What is one to make of the throwaway statement that in 1934 on a cruise to the Dutch East Indies Churchill's wife, Clementine, 'fell in love with Terence Philip, who was seven years her junior and almost certainly homosexual'? Who was (is) Terence Philip? Not even The Sun newspaper could - or would wish to - get away with a claim like that without some substantiation. By this stage the reader may sense that there is something wrong with Ponting's book - a tendency perhaps to drive on relentlessly, just as Ponting accuses Churchill of an addiction to aerial bombing and gas warfare. The reader would be right. This is a pity because Churchill clearly was an infuriating man even to those who served him loyally. He made many mistakes in war as well as in peace. For instance, he underestimated the submarine and came to believe that only he could handle Stalin in a way that Neville Chamberlain once believed that only he (Chamberlain) could deal with Hitler. Yet Churchill did stand up to Nazi Germany. If Halifax, the only other contender, had become prime minister in 1940, subsequent European history might have been very different. Churchill also had a way with language which, although sometimes florid, caught the imagination of the British people. Sometimes he had the common touch. As even Ponting admits, it was Churchill who insisted that the Local Defence Volunteers called for by Anthony Eden at the War Office should be renamed the Home Guard. The best quotation in the book comes from John Maynard Keynes reviewing one of Churchill's early works in 1919. Keynes wrote of Churchill's 'undoubted conviction that frontiers, races, patriotisms, even wars if need be, are ultimate verities for mankind, which lend for him a kind of dignity and even nobility to events, which for others are only a nightmare interlude, something to be permanently avoided.' Yet nightmares occur and Churchill was there.</p>

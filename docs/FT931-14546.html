			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / People: Bricom - new patient for McCann Tony McCann, who has been given the job of breathing new life into the heavily indebted Bricom industrial conglomerate, knows full well the perils of being a company doctor. You tend to get called in when everyone else has failed and your reputation suffers if you can't revive the corporate patient. In terms of company doctors, McCann, 52, is not in the same league as the likes of Sir Lewis Robertson and David James, and after a couple of unsuccessful rescue attempts - Harland Simon and Astra - he needs to chalk up a success if he is to make a reputation for industrial turnrounds. The attraction of McCann's latest challenge is that he is inheriting a group with some good companies and, unlike the Harland Simon case, he says that he is 'assured of the banks' support'. Originally a management buy-out of the non-financial interests of British &amp; Commonwealth, Bricom has lurched from one financial disaster to another. It was bought by a Swedish investor group in June 1990 that itself later collapsed and was taken over just over a year later by Sweden's Nordbanken. The latter then had to be rescued by the government and Bricom's ultimate parent is now the state-owned Securum, formed at the beginning of 1993 to take over Nordbanken's loans and bad debts. McCann, who was found through headhunters, has been given the job of developing a motley collection of businesses which include passenger and cargo handlers Serviceair; ANC, the parcel delivery service; and Neville &amp; Gladstone office supplies. They have a total turnover of around Pounds 300m a year. McCann is a relatively recent recruit to the ranks of company doctors. He spent 17 years at Black &amp; Decker before moving to Sunbeam International and then Littlewoods where he was managing director of the mail order business. His first rescue job was Astra Holdings. Although he was unable to prevent the receivers being called in, he describes it as 'a moderately successful outcome for the banks, though less so for the shareholders'. Meanwhile, Lord Eden, the former conservative MP, has stepped down as Bricom's non-executive chairman, along with chief executive Allan Jonnes, and executive director Matt McBride. ***** Keith Clark, 48, has been elected senior partner of the London based international law firm Clifford Chance. He has been elected for a five-year term in succession to Nigel Fox Bassett who has been senior partner since May 1990. Clifford Chance - the UK's largest law firm with 230 partners - was formed in 1987 through a merger of Clifford Turner and Coward Chance. Clark joined Coward Chance in 1971 where he specialised in banking and finance. He was made a partner in 1977. Since 1981, however, he has been particularly involved in sovereign debt restructuring and recently has taken the lead in the development of Clifford Chance's central and eastern European practice. Geoffrey Howe, the firm's managing partner, describes Clark as a good communicator and long-term stategist. He will take up his role in May after a short sabbatical. ***** John Roberts, formerly md of Post Office Counters, has been appointed chairman of Post Office Counters and of Subscription Services, on the retirement of Ken Young, and md of group services. Richard Close becomes md finance for the POST OFFICE. ***** Duncan Whyte, finance director, has been appointed chief operating officer, electricity supply, and Michael Smith, marketing and distribution director, has been appointed chief operating officer, developing businesses, of SCOTTISH POWER. A finance director is being recruited. ***** Tony Pike, formerly md of Schering Industrial Products, has been appointed md of SCHERING Agrochemicals. ***** David Cheesman, formerly a UK investments director at 3i, has joined TRINITY CAPITAL PARTNERS; Mark Rowlinson, formerly deputy financial controller at 3i, has been appointed finance director of LONDON GENERAL TRANSPORT SERVICES, a subsidiary of London Buses.</p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: Optus plans broadband network Continental Cablevision, the US cable company, Mr Kerry Packer's Nine Network, Australia's leading commercial TV company, and the smaller Seven Network are joining forces with Optus, the national telecommunications group, in a joint venture to develop a broadband cable network. The venture will spend more than ADollars 3bn (USDollars 2.2bn) during the next four years. The cable system aims to deliver local telephone calls, pay television and - by 1998 - interactive services to 50 per cent of Australian homes. The initial services, which will include pay-TV and local telephony, are expected during the third quarter of 1995. Funding requirements for the joint venture company, to be called Optus Vision, are put at about ADollars 2.5bn. Part will come from debt financing. Yesterday, Mr Bob Mansfield, Optus chief executive, suggested that the equity investment by the four partners could amount to ADollars 1bn-plus during the first two years. Optus will have a 35 per cent interest in the joint venture company, and Continental Cablevision, 30 per cent. Nine Network, which earlier this year agreed to subscribe ADollars 318m for a 15 per cent stake in Optus, will take a 20 per cent holding. Seven Network will have 15 per cent interest. Seven's involvement is controversial. Its chief shareholders include Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and the government-owned Telstra telecommunications group, both developing rival cable plans. The company said that its decision was in the interest of all its shareholders. Construction of the network is due, and much of it will involve aerial, rather than underground, cabling. Optus conceded that local authorities were still being approached for permission but announced co-operative agreements with two electricity suppliers. Optus promises to be the first network to deliver phone calls exclusively over a fibre-coaxial system. The company competes with Telstra in the long-distance market, and with Telstra and Vodaphone in the cellular phone market. Owned by several corporate and institutional shareholders, it plans to float on the stock market next year.</p>

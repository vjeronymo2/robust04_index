			<p>BFN     [Text] Tripoli, 12 May 1994, JANA -- AL-SHAM has affirmed  that any exchange of interests, tourists, and friendship is  merely a cover being used by Western powers to sneak in caravans  of spies and agents as well as to set up bases to be used for  planning dirty operations and the gathering of information.    It pointed out in an article published in today's issue that  the latest of those who entered our country for innocent reasons  was a German tourist. He entered Libya, but after being  involved in a traffic accident he turned to be the director of a  department at the German intelligence. This confirms that as  soon as a Westerner is involved in an accident or if he dies in  our Arab homeland his government swiftly announces publicly  through various media organs that he is a spy.    Under the header "They Are All Spies," AL-SHAMS says: Many  Westerners have been entering our Arab region legally and for  other public purposes. They are traders, tourists, commercial  representatives, businessmen, diplomats, or workers in the  so-called humanitarian agencies. They all claim that they are  in love with the East. Arab countries open their doors for them  by extending to them the renown Arab hospitality, the warmth of  Eastern feelings, and a will to exchange with them friendship  and interests.    The paper AL-SHAMS affirms that, if true, this a required  and  desired logical thing. However, the West always reveals to us a  different face of those tourists, traders, diplomats, and  humanitarian organization officials. The West reveals their  true identity when it happens that one of them becomes involved  in a road accident, an aggression, a disappearance, or a  kidnapping by unknown persons. Then the state of the person  involved hurriedly reveals his true identity and announces that  the person in question is a spying intelligence officer, or the  head of a spying network for his country, or an official of an  administration of this network.    This happened in Lebanon, and everybody remembers the  Western  nationals who were kidnapped as civilians holding various  functions. The Western news media themselves revealed their true  identity as intelligence officers. Had this been a one-time  incident, or related to just one Western country, we would have  thought of good intentions and the matter would have stayed  there. But the repetition of admissions of these repeated  incidents involving several countries reveals a remarkable  phenomenon that calls for thought and begs the following  question: Why does the West send us only its intelligence  officers and men? Americans entered Lebanon for apparently  innocent and humanitarian causes, including religious purposes,  and after their kidnapping, America announced that they were  intelligence men on a spying mission.    Frenchmen also entered Lebanon for the same reasons.  Englishmen entered Iraq and then Britain announced, after they  had disappeared, that they were intelligence officers.    The last of those who entered our country for innocent  reasons was a German tourist who entered Libya and was involved  in a traffic accident, and lo and behold he turned out to be a  department head in the German intelligence services.    Thus, with every accident or death of a Westerner in our  Arab  homeland his state quickly offers an official admission from the  government through various media to the effect that the person  concerned was a spy.    This frequency and repetition of the phenomenon confirms to  us that all nationals from foreign states who enter our country  are intelligence officers or agents for those states and that  they move to achieve base objectives by carrying out acts of  sabotage, sowing discords, spreading rumors, and affecting the  morale of our nation.    [Passage indistinct]...and the building of bases to plan the  dirty operations and gather information.    Can we now trust any Westerner who enters our country? And  do we have the right to give them a friendly welcome and warm  hospitality?</p>

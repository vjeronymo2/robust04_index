			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Song Xuechun (1345 1331 2504) and </F> XINHUA reporter Zhang Rongda (1728 2837 1129)]    [Text] Qingdao, 22 Apr (XINHUA) -- The national meeting  attended by directors of the departments (offices) of  provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal commissions for  discipline inspection ended here today. The meeting stressed  that the new situation demands that all these organs  conscientiously carry out the following three tasks: paying  attention to the party's policy of reform, development, and  stability; strengthening their service functions; and pushing  forward the anticorruption struggle. The meeting also held that  the important conditions for guaranteeing all these organs to  better perform their duties lie in bringing into full play their  role as an assistant, inspector, and coordinator.    The meeting affirmed the achievements attained by these  organs in strengthening the party's work style, building a clean  and honest government, and fighting against corruption. The  meeting held that in light of this year's work and the  anticorruption campaign put forward by the central authorities,  all these organs should fully play their roles and work harder  in carrying out the following four tasks. First, it is  necessary to improve information and statistical work. In this  way, they can reflect in a timely fashion the new situation,  problems, and experiences in their anticorruption struggle to  improve their work system, strengthen dynamic analysis, and  provide conditions for the better implementation of the  anticorruption struggle and a basis for formulating policy.  Second, it is necessary to improve the supervision and  inspection work. All these organs should focus on carrying out  the guiding spirit of the third plenary session of the Central  Commission for Discipline Inspection and on conducting  extensively the anticorruption struggle. They should enhance  the quality of their supervision and inspection work and  promptly receive feedback on the results of their work. Third,  it is necessary to improve coordination work. They should  further smooth away the problems in their internal and external  relations after discipline inspection and supervision units  began to work together in the same offices. They should assist  leading comrades in solving new problems cropping up during the  course of the anticorruption struggle and promote the healthy  development of such a struggle. Fourth, it is necessary to  improve the press and public opinion work. They should let the  public fully understand new results and experiences regarding  the anticorruption campaign. In dealing with the ideological  trends inside and outside the party as well as the symptoms,  tendencies, and work problems in a particular period, they  should write articles to guide public opinion.    Attending the meeting were directors of the departments  (offices) of the commissions for discipline inspection from all  provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, and cities with  provincial-level economic decision-making authority; of the Work  Committee for Organs Under the Central Committee, and of the  Work Committee for Central Government Organs, as well as  representatives from excellent information network points. Wang  Guang, Standing Committee member and general secretary of the  Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, presided over and  spoke at the meeting. Directors of the departments (offices) of  the commissions for discipline inspection from Fujian and other  13 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities exchanged  their experiences at the meeting. A total of 13 advanced  information work units including the Jiangsu Provincial  Commission for Discipline Inspection and 32 excellent  information network points including the Commission for  Discipline Inspection of Yuncheng Prefecture were commended at  the meeting.</p>

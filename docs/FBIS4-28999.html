			<p>BFN     [Summary] The fifth session of the Ninth National Assembly  entered its 17th day today.    "In the morning, the deputies continued to discuss the  situation regarding the implementation of the socioeconomic plan  for the first six months of 1994 and the socioeconomic tasks for  the last six months of the year. The morning session was  directed by National Assembly Vice Chairman Nguyen Ha Phan.    "In financial and monetary matters, all those who spoke  expressed their concern about the status of budget revenue and  expenditure. Some deputies suggested that we should carry on  the policy of promoting increased savings among the people by  increasing the interest rate for savings accounts and  encouraging enterprises to increase production in order to  generate new sources of revenue."    Many deputies raised the question of how to vigorously shift  agricultural production to the manufacture of marketable  products.    Others called for economic development in mountainous areas.  They asked the state to take practical measures in terms of  capital, market, and transportation.    "In terms of capital construction, many deputies called for  a  review of the 1994 program for capital construction and those  projects which are still left unfinished from past years."    Some deputies observed that "the present accounting system  in  our country is only suited to the subsidy-based economic  management system because it does not take into account profits  or losses. It must, therefore, be revised to suit the market  system."    In addition to the observations about improving cultural and  artistic activities, "many deputies continued to raise the  warning about a failure to resolve several social ills such as  opium smoking, drug addiction, prostitution, and about the  danger of many video and movie films being illicitly imported  and many books dating back from the old regime being reprinted."    They also expressed worries about the degradation of public  health and the education system and about the shortage of  Level-1 and level-2 school teachers and medical personnel for  mountainous regions.    They pointed out that "It is the desire of the people to see  the government strictly maintain law and order, positively carry  out thrift, fight corruption and smuggling, and take stern  actions against those who take advantage of the renovation  policy in enriching themselves illegitimately or working against  national order and discipline."    This afternoon, the National Assembly continued to work  under  the direction of Chairman Nong Duc Manh.    Various cabinet members answered questions raised by  deputies. They included:    -- Mr. Do Quoc San, minister of state and head of the State  Planning Commission, who answered a question about the  implementation of Project 327 on covering bare hills with  greenery.    -- "Mr. Ho Te, minister of finance, who answered a question  about the situation regarding budget revenue and expenditure.  He explained various measures aimed at promoting increased  revenue during the final months of the year such as guarding  against tax collection shortfalls, seeking local and foreign  loans, and economizing on spending in order to balance revenue  and expenditure."    -- "Mr. Hoang Duc Nghi, minister and head of the  Nationalities and Mountain Region Committee, who answered  questions about the supply of essential commodities to mountain  regions, and about the outcome of an opium control program."    -- Mr. Nguyen Quang Ha, minister of agriculture, who  answered  a question about the outcome of the implementation of Prime  Minister's Directive 525 and Program 327 on the delivery of  forests and forest land [to local peasants for management].    "Tomorrow, the National Assembly will continue work at the  Conference Hall."</p>

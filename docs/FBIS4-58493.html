			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Algeria: National Security and </F> Foreign Intelligence Chiefs Replaced in Military Reshuffle"]    [Except] Algiers, AL-HAYAH -- Three days before the march  to be staged in support of the dialogue in Algeria, President  Major General Liamine Zeroual yesterday made changes among  commanders of the military zones and some senior Army posts.    No information has leaked about the new appointments and  changes among commanders of the military zones. The names of  the commanders who have been pensioned off are surrounded by  complete secrecy. However, a high-level source has revealed to  AL-HAYAH that Fadil Saidi, director of foreign intelligence, has  been moved to another post and that Gen. Tawfik, chief of the  intelligence organs, is still in his post.    The ALGERIAN NEWS AGENCY announced in the afternoon that  Mohamed Douadah had been appointed director of national  security, replacing Mohamed Tolba, who has been in charge of  national security since January 1992.

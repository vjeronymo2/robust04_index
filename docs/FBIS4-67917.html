			<p>BFN     [Text] Damascus, April 30 (AFP)--An Iraqi Kurdish  opposition group on Saturday alleged China was supplying Iraq  with chemical weapons through a third country.    ``Kurdish police intercepted on the night of 17 April two  trucks carrying 19 tonnes of sodium phosphate used to make  mustard gas and chemical weapons,'' a statement by the Patriotic  Union of Kurdistan (PUK) said.    The chemicals were smuggled into Iraq through a  ``neighbouring'' third country, according to the statement  received here by AFP which did not identify the country.    The truck drivers ``admitted during questioning'' they were  trying to transport the chemicals through Kurdish-controlled  northern Iraq to regions controlled by the Iraqi central  government.</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Eurotunnel confident of raising debt ahead of a rights issue Eurotunnel was last night confident of raising almost all the Pounds 700m senior bank debt which the Channel tunnel operator needs before launching an Pounds 850m rights issue. This could take place towards the end of next week. By yesterday afternoon, commitments had been received from banks for Pounds 580m, still well short of the required sum. But in a remarkable shift from bleak pessimism to cautious optimism in just 24 hours, the group's bankers said last night they were confident of 'delivering what the company requires'. 'There is a whole new mood at Eurotunnel,' said a banker. The Bank of England has played an important role over the past two weeks in persuading recalcitrant banks to contribute. It is highly unlikely that Eurotunnel's four main Japanese bank creditors - Bank of Tokyo, Long Term Credit Bank, Sanwa and Industrial Bank of Japan - would have agreed to make contributions to the senior debt without pressure from the Bank. It also emerged that the refinancing would have failed without the participation in the senior debt offer of two public sector banks, the European Investment Bank, which contributed more than Pounds 50m, and Germany's reconstruction bank, KFW. The 200-bank syndicate hopes to complete its side of the fund-raising exercise by the middle of next week. The rights issue would be launched immediately afterwards. Leading fund managers said underwriting the issue would be extremely difficult. They will insist on an issue price at a substantial discount to last night's price of 374p for Eurotunnel units, down 30p on the day. In a separate development, Mr Richard Morris, Eurotunnel's safety director, said yesterday he was under instructions to 'meet and cajole' the Anglo-French Intergovernmental Commission on safety to grant a safety certificate for passenger services as soon as possible. While stressing there was no intention of compromising safety, Mr Morris said he was optimistic that the latest target for the start up of passenger services will be brought forward from September to late July, in time for the peak summer period.

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Bush set to demand curbs on spending PLANS for tougher control of federal spending - especially 'entitlement' programmes such as government health care schemes - appear likely to form a central plank of the economic strategy President George Bush will unveil in his acceptance speech on Thursday. A commitment to spending restraint is regarded by Republican strategists as advantageous for several reasons. It appears the only way to square a daunting fiscal circle: the vocal conservative wing of the party is calling for sweeping tax cuts in a second term, yet Mr Bush and many moderate Republicans are anxious to reduce the record fiscal deficits that have plagued his first presidency. In theory sufficient restraint of spending could allow both goals to be met simultaneously. A clamp on spending would also highlight philosophical differences between the Republican and Democratic parties. Governor Bill Clinton is proposing to increase public investment spending by Dollars 200bn (Pounds 105bn) over four years. A credible plan to contain spending would allow Mr Bush to portray Democratic plans as irresponsible while stressing his commitment to a smaller, less intrusive public sector. The pressure for tax cuts seems likely to intensify as the week progresses. Mr Jack Kemp, the housing secretary and a popular figure on the right of the party, has already called for a cut in the basic rate of tax from 15 to 12 per cent and a big increase in personal allowances. He also wants a top income tax rate of 28 per cent and a maximum capital gains taxes rate of 15 per cent, about half the present top rate. Neither Mr Kemp nor the official highly conservative party 'platform' (which also favours a revival of 1980s supply-side doctrines) makes any attempt to quantify the cost of such measures. Few Republicans dispute the potential appeal of tax cuts. The difficulty is making them appear consistent with Mr Bush's other commitments - such as his support for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. Projections published last week by the independent Congressional Budget Office indicate that the outlook for the federal deficit is now much bleaker than most analysts appreciate. If the faltering economic recovery gathers momentum, the CBO expects the deficit to decline slowly over the next couple of years, to Dollars 244bn (3.5 per cent of GDP) in 1995. However, it will then climb again, reaching Dollars 514bn by 2002 - or roughly the same percentage of GDP as the current deficit (which is swollen by the bailout of bankrupt savings and loan institutions). The worst culprits are two of the biggest entitlement programmes - Medicare for the elderly and Medicaid for the poor. Over the next five years, spending on these programmes is set to rise by 71 per cent and 85 per cent respectively. Together they may absorb over 6 per cent of GDP in 2002, compared with 3.4 per cent today. Mr Bush has said he does not favour a cap on the biggest entitlement programme, social security (federal pensions). But he may propose caps on most other entitlements, including health and such smaller programmes as veterans' benefits and farm subsidies. Such caps, which might restrain growth of spending to inflation plus population growth, would be a logical extension of caps placed on discretionary spending under the bipartisan budget agreement of 1990. Caps on entitlement spending could deliver big 'savings' but would by no means be an election-winner for Mr Bush. CBO figures suggest there is no room for tax cuts even if caps were implemented. And such figures make no allowances for new spending proposals such as the Republican plan for health care tax credits which would cost an extra Dollars 100bn over five years. Caps on entitlements, moreover, could prove exceedingly unpopular. Mr Clinton is believed to be planning a vigorous counter-attack if Mr Bush does embrace such a strategy, arguing that both poor and middle-class families could suffer if arbitrary curbs are imposed on government social programmes. Mr Clinton argues that changes in the structure of social programmes, rather than caps, are the way to achieve savings.</p>

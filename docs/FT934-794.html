			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / GM invests Pounds 130m in upgrade of Luton plant General Motors, the US car-maker, is to invest about Pounds 130m during the next two years to modernise and automate its Vauxhall assembly plant at Luton, Bedfordshire. Vauxhall is planning to increase capacity at the plant, which produces the Vauxhall Cavalier-Opel Vectra large family car, by about 25 per cent by the end of 1995, when the present car is replaced. The company has emerged as the most profitable carmaker in the UK during the recession, and the Luton plant is now GM's lowest-cost assembly facility in Europe for the Cavalier-Vectra, ahead of rival plants in Belgium and Germany. In preparation for the introduction of the Cavalier-Vectra replacement in two years, GM is planning a marked increase in the level of automation at the Luton plant. It is investing heavily in new equipment for body welding, and the number of robots at the plant will be increased from the present 34 to about 215. The amount of automated spot welding will rise from 20 per cent to 70 per cent of the total. GM is also installing a new trim and final assembly line. The investment in new plant and equipment, coupled with the improved design of the new car, is aimed at reducing the time needed to make each car by more than a third to about 17 hours a car by 1998. Vauxhall is aiming to increase the plant capacity from about 48 to 60 cars an hour or some 215,000 cars a year by the end of 1995, when it begins production of the new model. In 1992, Luton produced a record 170,600 cars. But production has fallen by nearly 30 per cent this year, to about 121,000, as exports have plunged in the face of the steep decline in demand in continental Europe. Exports in 1993 have accounted for only 14.7 per cent of the plant's output, compared with 41 per cent last year.</p>

			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Japan MPs urge electoral amnesty A majority of members of Japan's lower house of parliament yesterday called for an electoral amnesty until the establishment of new constituency boundaries, likely this autumn. The request, in a petition signed by 306 of the 511 members of the lower house, was presented to Mr Tsutomu Hata, prime minister of the embattled minority government. This reduces the likelihood of a sweeping change in government over the next few months, but does not rule out a vote of no confidence against the administration. Mr Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic party, and Mr Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic party, the two biggest opposition groups, have called for a vote of confidence after this year's long-overdue budget gets through the upper house. Parliamentary officials expect the budget to be adopted by June 23, a week before the end of the parliamentary session on June 29. If successful, such a vote would lead to a cabinet reshuffle which could broaden the government with opposition members getting ministerial posts. Signatories to yesterday's petition, organised by Mr Yuji Tsushima, chairman of the LDP's main policy board, include 60 LDP politicians and 34 from the SDP. This confirms that opposition parties agree, after weeks of indecision, that they would gain little by calling an election under the existing multi-seat constituency system. That would make it look as if they wanted to delay popular political reform. Parliament agreed only last January to replace the existing system, blamed for fostering corruption, with a mixture of proportional representation and single-seat districts. However, the Home Affairs Ministry has not yet completed the draft of the electoral boundary bill needed to complete political reform, expected to go to a parliamentary session after the summer break. Meanwhile, the coalition is negotiating behind the scenes to attract support from both opposition parties and stave off a no-confidence vote. Here the North Korean crisis has tipped the balance towards a coalition partnership with the LDP, on the grounds that it may need LDP moderates' support for sanctions against Pyongyang. The strategy of Mr Koji Kakizawa, foreign minister, for a warning to North Korea followed by phased United Nations sanctions has broad LDP support. Mr Kakizawa was a member of the LDP until seven weeks ago, when he accepted a job with the new government. A growing number of LDP politicians want to keep Mr Hata in power at least until early next month, to avoid Japan looking embarrassingly leaderless at the annual Group of Seven summit in Naples from July 8 to 10. A last-minute parliamentary rush to get the budget through the lower house prevented Japan from sending a cabinet minister to the recent ministerial meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.</p>

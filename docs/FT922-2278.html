			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Survey of European Building &amp; Construction (11): The bubble that burst - The problems of the Nordic region's industry THE PRESENT recession afflicting most of the Nordic region's construction sector looks set to continue until the middle of the 1990s. Indeed, over the next two years a drop of 30 per cent is expected in Swedish residential property investment, the severest decline the country has seen in its building industry since before the Second World War. It marks quite a contrast with the booming 1980s when construction and real estate were the focus for a speculative but lengthy expansion, based on rocketing property values and frenetic demand across Scandinavia. The construction bubble really burst in the fourth quarter of 1990 but its negative after-effects continue to blight much of the region in the shape of bad loans to most of the commercial banks, spiralling bankruptcies of many small and medium-sized real estate and property companies and a sharp contraction in new construction projects. Mr Lars-Ove Hakansson, chief executive of Skanska, the largest construction and real estate company in the Nordic area, warned his shareholders this spring that the Swedish building industry would have to live with the adverse market situation for another three to four years, just as Norway took a long time to adjust after its economic crisis in 1986. To make matters worse, he also suggested the Swedish real estate market faced five more difficult years ahead. His pessimism is shared by the Swedish government. Its recently published medium-term economic survey forecast a sharp slump in residential construction investment of -16.5 per cent this year and a further -15.5 per cent in 1993. The trouble is that the construction industry is not just suffering from a cyclical downturn but the consequences of an underlying structural change that is transforming the property market across the Nordic region. All the governments plan to reduce the high levels of subsidisation that have distorted the building sector as it adapts to the 19-nation European Economic Area that comes into force next January. The Swedish government in particular is seeking to free the property sector from controls that have tended to distort free market forces. The reform of corporate taxation is making mortgage financing of property investment less advantageous while a sharp rise in value-added tax on housing transactions from 12.87 to 25 per cent has added to cost burdens. An investment grant specifically aimed at construction has been abolished. The overdue deregulation of the Nordic region's over-protected construction industry seems unlikely to stimulate any increase in business activity. On the contrary, it looks as though it could dampen already weak demand still further. Moreover, under the agreed rules of the EEA the Nordic countries will have to accept the principle of open tendering for construction contracts and this looks set to increase competition at a time when there are limited business opportunities. However, if the recession in housing and commercial real estate persists until 1994-1995, that does not mean there will be a complete stagnation in the Nordic construction industry. Even governments that are determined to maintain tight control over public expenditure programmes seem prepared to encourage selective investment projects to improve the infrastructure, most notably through the construction of better roads and railways. The scheme to build a road and rail bridge over the waters of the Oresund between Denmark and Sweden should provide plenty of opportunities for Nordic companies in the next few years just as the Great Belt construction scheme in Denmark which is expected to link Zealand with the island of Funen by 1997 has given a boost to several western European building contractors, not just from the Nordic region. But as Mr Hakansson warned recently, a doubling of transportation infrastructure investments to SKr8-10bn a year will 'only offset a small fraction of the shortfall in housing and commercial real estate construction'. However, for Skanska and other large companies the recession has provided the opportunity to become more cost-conscious, to strengthen marketing operations and improve efficiency. When the upturn comes, they will be in a better position to compete successfully in what will be a more global and open market.</p>

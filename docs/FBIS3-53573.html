Despite the promise of a lull in hostilities due to a  blanket  of snow that descended on Kabul in the night, the artillery  firefight continued for 90 minutes, followed by the deadly  rattle of small-arms fire.    Pro-Rabbani troops are now in their 18th consecutive day of  fighting against the rival Uzbek forces of ex-communist General  Abdol Rashid Dostam, and his military partner Prime Minister  Golboddin Hekmatyar.    Rabbani's spokesman told AFP that the president had rejected  his rival's demand for his resignation as a precondition to the  cessation of the fighting.    "The president has already triumphed," said spokesman Abdol  Aziz Morad, as windows in his house rattled from the shock-waves  of incoming artillery bursts.    He said the coup attempt by the "Dostam militia" had failed,  and that except for the two eastern bases of Bala Hissar and  Maranjan Hill, Dostam forces had lost most of their strongholds  in Kabul.    Morad stressed there would be no ceasefire with the Dostam  forces.    "The concept of a ceasefire has no reality. A sacred war,  Jihad, has been declared," he stated.    Morad reiterated Radio Kabul's message that the April 1992  general amnesty issued for Dostam's ex-communist forces had been  suspended.    Morad said that captured Dostam forces would face trial in  accordance with the Shariat, or Muslim religious law.    Dostam himself, Morad said, is a "killer and a criminal, who  did nothing for the past 15 years except assassinate the Afghan  people".    Although he blamed Dostam, former Afghan communist president  Babrak Karmal, and Hekmatyar equally for the coup attempt, no  Jihad has been formally declared against the prime minister's  Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan] faction.    "But if Hezb stand with the Dostam militia, they will be  killed in the same way as the militia will be killed," Morad  said.    He said there were many honest mojahedin among the Hezb-e  Eslami ranks, and that the "state" was trying to woo them over  to its side.    "We are trying to split the honest Hezb from their  leadership," said Morad. "It would be better if all the Hezb  split from Hekmatyar."    Rabbani's camp does not recognise Hekmatyar as the country's  legal prime minister. "Hekmatyar has forfeited his honour, his  prestige, and the achievments of his political past," Morad said.    In Pakistan, the Hezb-e Eslami said Rabbani had lost  legitimacy. A Hezb statement urged all countries not to deal  with his government, saying that it did not represent the will  of the Afghan people.</p>

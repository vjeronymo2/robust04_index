			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Irfan Sapmaz: "Aliyev Resists Russia's Pressure"] </F>   [Text] Baku--Russia maintains its diplomatic and military  pressure on Azerbaijan in order to force it to agree to the  deployment of its military forces in that republic. Meanwhile,  it has been reported that, considering President Geydar Aliyev's  resistance to Moscow's wishes, Russia is worried by his upcoming  visit to Ankara.    It has been reported that Russia has intensified its  pressure  on Aliyev to force him to agree to the redeployment of two  Russian military units in Azerbaijan. The two units were moved  out of that republic in 1992 by former President Abulfaz  Elchibey. Meanwhile, Russia has planned to base the two units  in Makhachkala and Derbent in Dagestan, which is on Russia's  border with Azerbaijan. The statement Aleksandr Baranov, deputy  commander of Russia's border units, gave to the POST FACTUM NEWS  AGENCY on 1 February revealed Russia's intention to base the two  military units on Azerbaijan's border.    Mirsalih Akhundly, head of the Azerbaijan Border Guards  Command Press Center, has said however that Azerbaijan has not  signed any agreement with Russia for the deployment of that  country's military units on the Republic's border. He also  asserted that Russia wishes in particular to base its military  forces along Iran's and Turkey's borders.    It will be recalled that in addition to diplomatic pressure,  Russia has also directed military pressure toward Azerbaijan by  having its military units fight on the side of the Armenians in  Karabakh. Considering all that, Moscow is seriously worried by  Aliyev's upcoming visit to Turkey and the possibility that he  may sign a military agreement in Ankara.</p>

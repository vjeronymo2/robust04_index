			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Irbil, Iraq, March 17, (AFP)--A senior member of the  Iraqi opposition urged the UN Security Council Thursday to  extend the sanctions on Iraq, saying Baghdad was far from  complying with UN resolutions for a lifting of the embargo.    Two UN ceasefire resolutions were adopted at the end of the  Gulf war in February 1991, calling on Iraq to destroy its  weapons of mass destruction and to allow UN aid organisations  free access across the country.    General Secretary of the main Iraqi opposition alliance  Iraqi  National Congress (INC), Dr. Ahmad Shalabi, told AFP: "The  Iraqi regime is every day further away from implementing  resolution 688" on allowing UN organisations access to carry aid  programmes.    Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz began a new effort  Wednesday to persuade the United Nations to lift the oil embargo  imposed after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait.    In talks with French Ambassador Jean-Bernard Merimee, this  month's Security Council chairman, 'Aziz called for an end to  the embargo on Iraq since his country had complied with UN  resolutions on disarming.    Shalabi, speaking from his headquarters in Salah al-Din,  said  a proposed option to lift the embargo only in Kurdish-controlled  northern Iraq would be "problematical."    He said any such proposal would "raise strong opposition  from  Turkey's side" because of Ankara's continuing conflict with  Kurds living in southeast Turkey.    He added that Turkey was the base for the UN operation  Provide Comfort set up at the end of the Gulf war in February  1991 to provide allied air cover for the Kurds in northern Iraq.    Kurdish leaders meanwhile said it would be a positive step  if  the UN lifted sanctions on northern Iraq.    The Security Council is expected to decide Thursday or  Friday  to keep the sanctions locked on Iraq, due to its view that  Baghdad has not met all council resolution requirements,  diplomats said.    Still a majority of the council's 15 members including  France, China and Russia have asked that the council acknowledge  Iraqi progress on disarmament, western diplomats said.</p>

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: In Shops considers bid for troubled Amber Day IN SHOPS, the Birmingham-based stores group, yesterday said it was considering making a bid for Amber Day, the discount retailer which has recently seen its share price collapse. Amber Day's shares yesterday rose 33p to 51p, giving the group a market value of Pounds 62m - well down on November's peak of Pounds 158m. In Shop's shares closed 10p lower at 74p, valuing it at Pounds 27m. The contrast in size between the two companies means that In Shops would need considerable support from the City to make a successful bid. However, Mr Tim Brookes, chairman, said he had not approached the Amber Day board and would not launch a bid without making further inquiries. Shares in Amber Day have fallen sharply following persistent criticism concerning Mr Philip Green, the group's flamboyant chairman and chief executive. They were also hit by a profits warning and the simultaneous departure of the group's finance director and only non-executive director. Mr Green is expected to appoint a finance director this week and intends to split his role with a new chairman. In Shops was outbid by Amber Day two years ago when they both sought What Everyone Wants, the discount retail chain which now accounts for most of Amber Day's business. Mr Brookes said: 'We believe the underlying business is sound and just needs the credibility at the top which we think we can provide.' Meanwhile, In Shops blamed the unexpected severity of the recession for a drop in its pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.7m to Pounds 2.8m in the year to March 31. Turnover rose to Pounds 24.5m (Pounds 21.3m), boosted by the opening of several new retail centres, where it rents out units to small retailers. In spite of a drop in earnings per share from 7.3p to 5.3p, the final dividend goes up by 10 per cent to 1.97p, giving a total of 2.63p (2.45p). The group had net cash of Pounds 3.3m at the year-end. Mr Brookes said: 'I believe that trading conditions will remain extremely tough for some considerable time and the end of the recession is not in view. We are planning our business for the prevailing economic conditions because in so doing we will make it stronger and more able to enjoy an economic recovery if it comes.'</p>

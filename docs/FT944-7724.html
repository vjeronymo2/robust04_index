			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: Sharp fall in provisions boosts Bank of Montreal A sharp fall in loan-loss provisions helped Bank of Montreal post its fifth consecutive year of record earnings, with fourth-quarter income jumping by one-third. The bank, which is the first of Canada's 'Big Six' banks to report 1994 results, lifted earnings to CDollars 825m (USDollars 603.8m), or CDollars 3.01 a share, for the year to October 31, from CDollars 709m, or CDollars 2.59, a year earlier. Return on equity climbed to 14.9 per cent from 14.1 per cent, and return on assets to 0.68 per cent from 0.63 per cent. Assets have risen by 18 per cent in the past year, to CDollars 138.2bn. Fourth-quarter earnings far exceeded analysts' estimates, jumping to CDollars 268m, or 99 cents a share, from CDollars 201m, or 74 cents, a year earlier. Return on equity for the latest period was 18.7 per cent. The bank is widely expected to raise its dividend. Loan losses for the year fell to CDollars 510m from CDollars 675m, in spite of a doubling in general provisions to CDollars 200m, which the bank said was a prudent move during the business upswing. The bulk of the drop in loan-loss provisions took place in the fourth quarter, when write-downs almost halved to CDollars 99m from CDollars 175m. The bank said the improvement took place across its entire portfolio of individual, commercial and corporate loans, but especially in the property sector. Non-performing loans dropped by 40 per cent to CDollars 1.4bn. One of the few setbacks was a 12 per cent slide in earnings from foreign exchange operations.</p>

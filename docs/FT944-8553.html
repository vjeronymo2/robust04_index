			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / ICI criticises electricity prices ICI, the chemicals company, yesterday criticised electricity pricing structures following a 60 per cent rise in prices it pays for power since the summer. It said the Office of Electricity Regulation had failed to ensure reasonably stable and competitive prices. The Association of Independent Electricity Producers said the average price in the electricity wholesale pool was likely to be within limits agreed between the regulator and the two main generators. 'There is no reason to believe that winter and summer prices should be the same,' it said. ICI and other big electricity consumers which buy power directly from the wholesale pool have for long campaigned for pricing structure changes. ICI said yesterday its Cheshire-based chlor-alkali business faced bills of more than Pounds 1m a week following the latest rises. Foreign competitors enjoyed lower and more stable prices, it said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Korean Residents in Russia Protest Forcible Migration" -- </F> KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- An organization of  Korean nationals in Russia sent a protest message respectively  to the Japanese and South Korean Consulates General in Russia  denouncing the South Korean traitorous clique and the Japanese  reactionaries for scheming to drag Korean residents in Sakhalin  into South Korea.    The message says the South Korean puppet authorities are  hell  bent on the deceptive propaganda to bring over fellow countrymen  in Sakhalin, acting in the guise of "humanitarianism", in an  insidious attempt to lay an anti-DPRK "foundation" in the Far  Eastern region by winning them over and foment discord and  consciousness of confrontation within the nation and thereby  perpetuate division of the country and block the compatriots  from advancing toward national reunification.    The South Korean authorities must renounce at once their  anti- national, anti-reunification scheme to settle the issue of  Korean residents in Sakhalin and other regions of the former  Soviet Union with some money through conspiracy and tieup with  the Japanese Government, and the Japanese authorities must no  longer do acts obstructive to an independent reunification of  Korea, it demands.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Mongolian Prime  Minister P. Jasray said today that developing a good-neighborly  relationship with China continues to be a priority of his  country's foreign policy.    He made the remarks during a banquet in honor of Chinese  Premier Li Peng who arrived in Ulaanbaatar on Thursday [28  April] for a two-day official visit.    Jasray voiced satisfaction with what he described as the  increasingly vigorous bilateral relations between the two  nations, as they currently experience a firmer legal basis and  wider scope of cooperation.    Referring to late Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to  Mongolia 34 years ago, when the two countries signed a treaty to  establish friendship and mutual help, Jasray revealed that  tomorrow the two modern-day leaders would sign an historic,  fundamental document that is of an equally important political  significance for the long-term and stable development of  bilateral ties.    He added that the two sides will also sign several  agreements  to consolidate the legal basis for bilateral ties.    Li's visit is a continuation of regular high-level summit  meetings between the two countries and Jasray said it plays an  important part in the development of Mongolia-China relations.    Commenting on China's achievements, Jasray said he hoped the  country would remain stable, prosperous and enjoy further  development in the future. He described China's peaceful  foreign policy as an important factor for safeguarding the peace  and stability in the Asia-Pacific and the world in general.    Li Peng said that the increasing exchanges between the two  countries have brought important benefits, deepened mutual  understanding and trust, as well as satisfying progress in  cooperation in all fields.    "We should cherish today's Sino-Mongolian relations," he  said, in a reference to "set-backs" that had occurred in the  past because of what he described as historical reasons.    He commented that the earlier Sino-Mongolian Treaty on  Friendship and Mutual Help had played an important role in the  growth of bilateral relations and declared that the new treaty  will turn a new page in history by further advancing  Sino-Mongolian relations and opening up a broader prospect for  friendly cooperation.    "The Chinese Government attaches great importance to Sino-  Mongolian relations and is ready to work together with the  Mongolian Government to build a long-term friendly relationship  of cooperation that is oriented to the next century," said Li.    According to Li the two major issues facing mankind today  were peace and development and he said China will, along with  Mongolia and all other peace loving peoples in the world, work  for the establishment of a new order of peace, stability,  cooperation and development in Asia and the world.    The Chinese premier went on: "We respect the Mongolian  people's choice of path for future development, and sincerely  hope and believe that they will overcome their temporary  difficulties, revitalize the economy and build up the country."    Attending the banquet with Li were his tour entourage, which  includes his wife Zhu Lin, Ismail Amat, state councillor and  minister in charge of the State Nationalities Affairs  Commission, Han Zhubin, minister of railways, Qi Huaiyuan,  director of the Foreign Affairs Office under the State Council,  and Ulgi, chairman of the People's Government of the  Inner-Mongolia Autonomous Region.</p>

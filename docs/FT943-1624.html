			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Local government financing rejected Delegates rejected an attempt to revive the old Liberal party's proposals for financing local government by site value ratings. They backed the greenfield development tax which envisages taxes levied on the increased value resulting from development of a greenfield site. Mr Simon Hughes, MP for London's Southwark and Bermondsey, promised that details of the energy and other environment taxes would be published before the next general election.</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CHARGES DROPPED IN FATAL SHOOTING BY ESTRANGED HUSBAND IN LOMITA  </P> <P> Criminal charges were dismissed Tuesday against a Lomita man who faced a murder  trial for shooting the nearly identical twin brother of his estranged wife's  boyfriend.  </P> <P> William Henry Hosken, 24, had been charged with first-degree murder for killing  Kevin Pack during a July 9 confrontation in the courtyard of Hosken's  condominium complex.  </P> <P> Although a South Bay Municipal Court judge decided in September that there was  enough evidence for the case to progress to trial, Torrance Superior Court  Judge Cecil J. Mills ruled Tuesday that Hosken was acting in self-defense when  he shot Pack.  </P> <P> Acting on a motion by defense attorney Michael Norris, Mills ordered all  charges against Hosken dropped.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Mary Hanlon had alleged that Hosken shot Pack after he  mistook him for Steven Pack, the man's twin brother, who had been dating  Hosken's wife, Donna. Donna Hosken testified during the preliminary hearing  that her husband had threatened Steven Pack several times before the July 9  confrontation.  </P> <P> However, Hosken's attorney said his client had been jumped by Kevin Pack and  two friends before he fired his gun.  </P> <P> Hanlon, who said she found Tuesday's ruling "very surprising," said her office  may either appeal Mills' decision or refile the charges.  </P> <P> "There were substantial grounds to hold him to answer," she said. "What I'm  saying is that a jury should have decided this."  </P> <P> After his ruling, Mills declined to discuss the case.  </P> <P> According to testimony during the preliminary hearing in September, Kevin Pack  and two friends went to Hosken's home the night of the shooting to try to  resolve the conflict between Hosken and Steven Pack.  </P> <P> The trio apparently used a false name to try to get Hosken to open the  complex's security gate.  </P> <P> After Hosken refused, his lawyer said Tuesday, he heard other buzzers being  rung in neighboring units and then heard voices in the courtyard.  </P> <P> Witnesses testified that Hosken grabbed a gun and went into the courtyard as  the three entered.  </P> <P> Almost immediately a fight ensued, and Hosken fired two shots at Pack, striking  him twice in the chest.  </P> <P> Although Pack's friends say they simply wanted to talk to Hosken, Norris said  other testimony indicated that they did not intend to do any talking.  </P> <P> "He had no idea who these people were who were ringing his unit . . . and as  soon as they see him, they jump on him," Norris said. "This was hardly a  peace-keeping mission. . . . I think they thought they were on a commando  mission.  </P> <P> "Bill acted reasonably and, although it's an absolutely tragic situation that  should have never happened, the criminal charges weren't right," Norris said.  </P> <P> Hosken's wife, however, said Tuesday she believes Hosken fired the shots  deliberately in the belief that he was killing her lover.  </P> <P> "He kept telling me that he was going to kill me and he was going to kill  Steve," she said. "The justice system is really messed up."  </P></p>

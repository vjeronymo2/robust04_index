He was a soldier  near the Namibian border from April 1988 to April 1989 when  Cuban forces went home at the implementation of UN Resolution  435 that ushered in Namibian independence.    Mr Robaina denied reports from Zambia that claimed he said  Cuba would again send troops to Angola in the event of foreign  intervention on the side of the UNITA rebels, saying Havana had  too many domestic difficulties to even consider it. He said the  overnight disappearance of Cuba's traditional economic relations  with the Soviet Union and East Bloc countries had left his  Caribbean island in serious economic difficulty.    Speaking in Windhoek at the tail end of a six-nation African  tour, he cited ongoing "irrational persecution" and a trade  blockade by the United States as a key factor in Cuba's strained  financial status. There was no sign of any flexibility from the  Clinton administration, he said, adding that Cuba was having to  undergo a policy transformation in order to survive in a changed  world.    U.S. pressure was creating problems for eight in every ten  international firms which tried to establish themselves in Cuba,  Mr Robaina said.    He said he was confident about a succesful conclusion to the  Angolan peace talks dragging on in Lusaka, and hoped for a  "happy ending" to the Angolan conflict.    During his visit to Namibia, Mr Robaina concluded a visa  exemption agreement and a trade pact which he said would further  consolidate relations between the two countries. Cuba is  expected to participate in Windhoek's international trade fair  in April, and has invited Namibia to reciprocate in Havana in  November.    Introducing the Cuban on Friday, Namibian Foreign Affairs  Minister Netumbo Ndaitwah said relations between Namibians and  Cubans were "sealed in blood".</p>

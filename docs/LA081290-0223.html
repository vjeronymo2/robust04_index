			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REAL LIFE  </P> <P> I just wanted to say how I enjoy all the "true life" informative programs now  on TV -- most of all "Rescue 911" -- and the rest, i.e., "Cops," "Unsolved  Mysteries," "PrimeTime Live," "48 Hours," "America's Most Wanted," "20/20."  </P> <P> I loathe the myriad of moronic sitcoms and unfortunately realize I'm in the  minority since the networks base popularity on the inaccurate A.C. Nielsen  ratings, which is wrong!  </P> <P> Anyway, I'm afraid "911" will be canceled since it seems to me the repeats  began very early.  </P> <P> Annette Mason, Inglewood  </P> <P> Not to worry. CBS rescued "911," which will return this fall, Tuesdays at 8  p.m.  </P></p>

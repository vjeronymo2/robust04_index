			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Selling order pressures sterling STERLING weakened as a large selling order from the Middle East put further pressure on the currency yesterday, but the reaction was probably overdone, according to dealers, and the pound staged a partial recovery later. It touched a low of DM2.9450 and temporarily fell to ninth from third place in the European exchange rate mechanism before finding a floor, possibly with the assistance of intervention by the Bank of England. The order to sell sterling and buy Dollars 500m by the National Commercial Bank of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia came at a particularly bad time, as sterling was already losing ground ahead of this weekend's Washington meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. Traders were trying to get square ahead of the G7 meeting, and in sterling's case this meant unwinding long positions after its recent failure to break through DM3.00. Fears about a deepening UK recession and political nervousness ahead of next week's local government elections in England and Wales have unsettled the currency. Mr Nick Parsons, economist at Union Discount, said that a few weeks ago a selling order of this size could have been absorbed without trouble, but yesterday was a different story. Traders, who had already squared positions, did not want to be left with the pounds and the order resulted in a game of 'pass the parcel', according to Mr Parsons. He added that this should not be regarded as a crisis as far as sterling is concerned. The pound rallied to maintain its position as the third strongest member of the ERM, based on figures from the European Commission. By the London close it was just slightly easier at Dollars 1.6940 against Dollars 1.6945. It was down to DM2.9600 from DM2.9725; to FFr9.9775 from FFr10.0175; to SFr2.4825 from SFr2.4925; and to Y233.75 from Y234.00. Sterling's index lost 0.4 to 90.8. In New York the pound ended 30 points lower at Dollars 1.6910. The D-Mark was supported by news that the Soviet Communist party's central committee had overwhelmingly rejected an offer by Mr Mikhail Gorbachev to resign as leader. The German currency was little changed in the ERM but improved against the dollar. It also rose to Y79.00 from Y78.70. Comments by US President George Bush that he would like to see world interest rates, including those of the US, come down tended to undermine the dollar. A rise in the number claiming US unemployment benefits in the week ended April 13 did nothing to encourage hopes of an early end to the recession and also weighed on the currency, leaving it towards the lowest levels of the day at the London close. The market is now waiting for today's figures on first-quarter US gross national product growth. At the finish in London the dollar had declined to DM1.7470 from DM1.7535; to Y138.00 from Y138.05; to SFr1.4655 from SFr1.4715; and to FFr5.8900 from FFr5.9125.</p>

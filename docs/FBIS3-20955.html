			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:CSO     (Text) The Hungarian branch of the French computer firm  Bull has just implemented a management personnel change. The  position of managing director Gerlai Matyas--after the OKHB's  [National Commercial and Credit Bank] 25 percent buy-out--ceased  to exist, and, at the end of October, his French managing  partner Ives Thon's commission also expired. On 1 November,  their combined positions have been taken by the 37-year-old  economist Gert-Jan de Kieviet, freshly arrived from the  Netherlands. His career at Bull began in 1989--earlier he was  the vice-president of an insurance association--and by 1991 he  had become the head of Bull's social security department.    According to Mr. Kieviet--whose opinion had been influenced  by an IDC [Information and Documentation Center] analysis on the  Hungarian computer industry--in recent years, Bull Hungary's  strength has developed exactly in areas for which IDC predicted  the greatest growth potential: value-added (complementary)  services, applications (ready-made, complete solution), and the  PC sector, respectively.    In reference to the future, Mr. Kieviet expressed his intent  to make the company a market leader in distributed computing  architecture and systems integration: he will not be a simple  box-seller, but wants to transform Bull Hungary into a  production unit with its activities focussed on open systems  solutions and services while "working together with consumers as  teams". In the West, the switch-over to open systems is  extremely expensive and cumbersome, due to the already  installed, custom-designed systems--made up of a large number  of computers--and due to the software written for them.    In this respect, Hungary enjoys a much luckier position.  Others, beside Mr. Kieviet, are also looking for these new  avenues: For instance, presently, a French banking specialist is  investigating ways to adapt Bull applications to Hungarian  conditions.    Mr. Kieviet places a great enphasis on applications and  complete solutions; according to his experience, not only in  Hungary is Bull considered by many to be just a hardware and  software manufacturer. The new CEO would like, by all means, to  change this image, showing the Hungarian market how complete the  Bull product line actually is.    He also wishes to introduce a more efficient management: He  believes that the marketing division must not rigidly separate  from the other branches. At year's end, the commission of  commercial director Jean-Luc Chalant will also expire: His  activity will be covered by existing personnel.    The new director has been preparing for the new assignment  since last summer, by diligently studying Hungarian,  familiarizing himself with the country. He confesses to have  found many similarities between Hungary and the Netherlands.</p>

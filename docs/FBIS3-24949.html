			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jovial Rantao, labor correspondent] </F>   [Text] The Congress of South African Trade Unions [COSATU],  which has supported the ANC [African National Congress] since  its inception, will become more influential in a future  government, says labour expert Duncan Innes. Writing in his  Innes Labour Brief, Innes argues that COSATU would have 20 of  its leaders occupying seats in parliament and at least one, Jay  Naidoo, in a key ministerial post.    "For this reason alone, labour relations will not be the  same  after elections as they were before. From being an  anti-establishment force under apartheid, COSATU is about to  become part of the new establishment," he writes. Being part of  the establishment can be a mixed blessing for a radical  organisation such as COSATU.    "On one hand, it does confer certain clear advantages on the  union movement, but it also brings with it responsibilities  which might not be so palatable to the union's constituency,"  Innes says.    Among the key advantages COSATU would derive from being part  of the establishment is that instead of having to fight from a  largely defensive position in the policy arena, it would now be  in a position to make policy proposals for the country. He says  the ANC's Reconstruction and Development Programme -- a crucial  part of its development strategy -- was co-ordinated by Jay  Naidoo. Alex Erwin of the National Union of Metalworkers of  South Africa played a major role in the drafting of the  programme.    "The unions are no longer on the outside; they're on the  inside of state policy formulation," Innes observes.    Going hand in hand with the advantages will be  disadvantages.    "The ANC will be inheriting a country that has been ravaged  by a lengthy and damaging recession, isolated from world trends,  torn apart by political strife and bedevilled by social disorder  and crime. Governing such a country is no easy task, especially  people who have no experience of government. Consequently, the  ANC government will find itself under massive pressures once it  assumes power, and it will look to its allies for support,"  Innes says.    Other difficulties would be that a person such as Jay Naidoo  -- "the Minister of Reconstruction" -- would be asked by the  Cabinet to secure union support for policies designed to keep  the public sector wage bill under control. In caucus meetings,  the COSATU MPs would be asked to use their influence to curb  militant strike action among workers in the interests of  promoting stability and order so as to attract foreign and local  investment, Innes says.</p>

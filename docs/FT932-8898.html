			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / France to renew sell-offs THE French cabinet is due to table a draft privatisation law on May 26, to pave the way for an ambitious programme of state company sell-offs expected to start after the summer. Terms and conditions will be similar to those in the last wave of wholesale privatisations, under the previous centre-right government of 1986-88, according to leaked details published by Figaro, the right-wing newspaper, over the weekend. The government is hoping to raise up to FFr200bn (Pounds 24bn) over four to five years from the sale of recently restructured industrial companies, the largest round of privatisations attempted in France. Likely candidates include Elf Aquitaine, the oil group, Rhone-Poulenc in chemicals, Pechiney in aluminium, and leading banks and insurers. The main difference from previous state sell-offs is that the government will create stronger takeover defences for privatised companies in sensitive sectors and will try to build loyal long-term shareholders, according to the leaked details. As in 1986, foreign stakes in privatised companies will be limited to 20 per cent. On top of this, foreign buyers could now be required to make some form of pledge to be long-term shareholders. One likely innovation is that private investors will be allowed to pay for privatised shares in instalments, a marketing device borrowed from British state sell-offs.</p>

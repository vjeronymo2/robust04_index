			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ivan Zhagel: "Foreign Trade Bank of Russia Will </F> Now be One-Third Owned by Gazprom"]    [Text] A Foreign Trade Bank of Russia [Vneshtorgbank]  stockholders meeting has admitted a number of new members, among  them the Gazprom Joint-Stock Company. The latter's contribution  to the bank's incorporation capital is $170 million.    What we are seeing happening before our very eyes is the  rapid transformation of what used to be a narrowly specialized  sectoral enterprise engaged in the extraction and transport of  gas into Russia's largest financial and industrial group, whose  interests are beginning to extend to all spheres of economic  life.    IZVESTIYA recently reported on Gazprom's desire to become  involved in the delivery of energy resources in the European  market direct to the consumer, the construction in Germany of  its own pipeline, and the acquisition of real estate there worth  1.7 billion German marks. Now there are these new facts,  providing evidence of Gazprom's penetration of the banking  sector.    Incidentally, the $170 million in incorporation capital  means  that Russia's largest commercial bank will now be more than  one-third owned by the Gazprom Joint-Stock Company. This is a  very appetising morsel, especially if you bear in mind that the  bank specializes in foreign economic operations and controls a  considerable proportion of them. As Russian Vneshtorgbank  Chairman Yuriy Poletayev said, they now service approximately 30  percent of the country's entire foreign trade turnover.    The Russian Vneshtorgbank is also an appetising morsel  because last year, for example, it made a profit of 178.2  billion rubles [R], or an increase of 9.4-fold. In the first  five months of this year alone, the bank's profit was R162  billion. Of course, a major contributory factor to the growth  of all the bank's indicators was that in 1993 a vast number of  the former clients of the USSR Vneshekonombank, some of its  largest ones, furthermore, brought their business here. They  thus brought money and lucrative operations and ensured a rapid  increase in revenue.    However, the fact that Gazprom has become a shareholder in  the Vneshtorgbank does not mean that the joint-stock company  will henceforth trample the bank underfoot. On the contrary, it  will go at least a small way toward balancing out the influence  of the state, which, in the form of the Russian Central Bank,  previously held more than 90 percent of the incorporation  capital and, of course, was able to exert a definite influence  on the bank's leadership. Furthermore, none of the other  shareholders was physically able to invest in the incorporation  capital a sum large enough to significantly reduce the state's  share. Only Gazprom has managed to do that.    It is interesting that, in Yu. Poletayev's words, the  Central  Bank's contribution to the Vneshtorgbank's incorporation capital  consisted of 50 tonnes of gold, which for a long time lay in the  vaults like a dead weight, and it was only recently that the  bank was given permission to send the gold abroad, where it  began to work and bring the bank revenue. But it is also  equally interesting that when last year's profit was  distributed, the Central Bank received nothing -- its gold  deposit was not put to work last year and thus did not earn  anything.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by BELINFORM correspondent Yekaterina Vysotskaya for </F> TASS]    [Text] Minsk 24 May TASS -- As of today the Republic of  Belarus has to pay six trillion Belarusian roubles to Russia for  fuel resources it has already used. But energy consumers alone  owe one trillion 200 billion, and 4.2 trillion hang in mid-air.    Commenting on the situation, National Bank of Belarus Board  of Directors Chairman Stanislav Bogdankevich said: "We bought it  cheap, sold cheap, and are living well. All this for the sake  of supporting industry, in order to reduce the cost of  production. But this has led us into a blind alley, because if  the consumption of power is not cut down, and one has to pay,  then after all it must be recovered from someone."    The chief treasurer of the republic noted that an idea is  already wandering, according to which the national bank will  have to "create out of air" 4 trillion and pay up. "But the way  this question is formulated is devoid of common sense," he  emphasised.</p>

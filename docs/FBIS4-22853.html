			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M. Yu. Katayev, A. A. Mitsel; UDC 517.518.8] </F>   [Abstract] Differentiation of an empirical function  specified on a grid  a=x[.sub]1[/]&lt;x[.sub]2[/]&lt;...&lt;x[.sub]n[/]=b is  incorrectly stated by its measured values f(x[.sub]i[/]),  i=1,...,n. The incorrectness of the differentiation problem is  related to violation of the third correctness condition  according to Adamar - the stability condition. Several methods  are used for the solution of this problem, including the  Tikhonov method where the differentiation problem is reduced to  the solution of the Fredholm equation of the first kind. With  these methods a stable solution is numerically determined from  the system of linear algebraic equations. An analytical solution  of smoothing out and differentiation of empirical data is  obtained in this paper and the results of numerical experiments  are provided.

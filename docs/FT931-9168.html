			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Yarrow peace initiative fails TALKS between management and unions at strikebound Yarrow Shipbuilders broke up yesterday with neither side giving ground, Catherine Milton writes. The talks took place at the request of Mr Murray Easton, managing director and chief executive of the Clydeside warship yard. He asked union officials for the opportunity to present the background to the company's wage offer directly to the shop stewards, who have rejected it. The company, which is facing its second week of an indefinite strike over wages and changes to working practices, has offered a Pounds 300 lump sum for the year to July followed by a 3.8 per cent rise for the following 12 months. The company is seeking changes to working practices, including the abolition of a Friday morning tea break. The 1,300 strikers want a substantial increase on their basic weekly rate of Pounds 218 for a skilled worker.</p>

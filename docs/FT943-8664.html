			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / HSBC stops own-account bond trading: Pre-tax profits up 24 per cent at Pounds 1.46bn - Sharp drop in dealing income HSBC Holdings, the international banking group, has largely suspended proprietary trading on bond markets after losing Pounds 123m on bond and interest rate-related trading during a turbulent first half, it disclosed yesterday. HSBC's shares fell 10p to 749p after it revealed that its exposure to financial trading led to a 10 per cent fall in non-interest income to Pounds 1.47bn. This included a sharp drop in dealing income to Pounds 73m from Pounds 522m. Despite the setback, a fall in provisions for bad and doubtful debts to Pounds 173m from Pounds 432m allowed HSBC to raise pre-tax profits by 24 per cent to Pounds 1.46bn from Pounds 1.18bn. The interim dividend goes up 14 per cent to 8p. Sir William Purves, HSBC chairman, said that the bank's treasury had been positioned for a rise in US interest rates in February, but was caught out by the 'rather drastic' rise in European bond yields that accompanied this. None of HSBC's internal limits were breached and no staff had been dismissed. But HSBC was 'not running significant positions today and we will not start again until we see markets that are more predictable'. Dealing income from foreign exchange rose to Pounds 196m from Pounds 180m. But it lost Pounds 92m on proprietory position taking in interest rate products, and lost a further Pounds 31m on other, primarily interest rate-related, trading. Losses continued at Concord Leasing, its US leasing arm, which has suffered from falls in the value of commercial aircraft. It lost Pounds 100m, against Pounds 22m in the first half of 1993 and Pounds 140m in the second half. Sir William said HSBC had changed Concord's chief executive and was negotiating with US banking regulators to fold it into Marine Midland, its US banking subsidiary. This would help it to use tax allowances arising from the losses. There was strong asset growth in Hong Kong, with advances at its subsidiary HongkongBank rising by 5.7 per cent from the end of 1993. This was due to demand for residential mortgages and corporate loans, and buoyant trade finance. The net interest margin stayed at 2.7 per cent, with interest-earning assets rising to Pounds 169bn from Pounds 159bn. Margins in HongkongBank narrowed from 2.4 to 2.3 per cent, mainly because of narrowing spreads on liabilities. Sir William said that he had 'no gleam in my eye' over the possibility of acquiring a UK building society. A purchase to add to Marine Midland was more likely, but it was unwilling to pay current prices for US regional banks. The annualised post-tax return on equity fell slightly to 19.3 per and the return on assets stayed at 1 per cent. The tier 1 ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets rose from 7.5 to 8.6 per cent. Profit attributable to shareholders advanced 13 per cent to Pounds 938m. The increase was lower than the rise in pre-tax profits because tax allowances from past losses have been used at Midland, and largely used at Marine Midland.

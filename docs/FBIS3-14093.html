			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Since yesterday afternoon the security forces have  been doing battle with several terrorists who barricaded  themselves in a house in Hebron. During the exchanges of fire,  several terrorists were hit, but their condition is not yet  known. During the fire exchanges yesterday two Hebron women  were wounded. According to an initial IDF [Israel Defense  Forces] investigation, the women were hit by terrorists'  gunfire, rather than by the IDF. One of the women was seriously  wounded and died a short time later in Hebron's 'Aliya Hospital.  The other woman was slightly wounded in the head and was  evacuated to a hospital in Jerusalem after being treated on the  spot by an IDF doctor. From the IDF's investigation it  transpired that the two were hit by the terrorists' gunfire.  Hebron is under curfew and the area was declared a closed  military zone.    Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq has just told  the Shamgar Commission that the 18 hour-long battle with the  terrorists in Hebron has just ended. Our correspondent Moti  Amir reports that to the best of his knowledge five IDF soldiers  were slightly wounded in the fire exchanges. They were  evacuated for treatment at a Jerusalem hospital. The bodies of  three terrorists were found in the building in which they were  barricaded in the al-Taraq neighborhood in Hebron; Kalashnikov  rifles and a Glilon submachine gun were found near the bodies.  During the battle the IDF directed antitank missiles and  machine gun fire at the building. Last night the area was lit  with flares; early this morning a large bulldozer was brought to  the area to demolish one of the buildings in which the  terrorists barricaded themselves. The bulldozer broke down and  it was necessary to bring in another bulldozer this afternoon to  recover the first one. The terrorists attacked the soldiers  operating the bulldozer, and at that point the IDF forces  stormed the building and killed the terrorists.    Our correspondent notes that in during the operation the  management of the al-Muhtasib children's hospital -- which is  located near the building concerned -- complained that soldiers  entered the hospital premises and that the children hospitalized  were greatly alarmed by the explosions and gunfire.</p>

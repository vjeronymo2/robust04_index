			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CRITICAL JUNCTION  </P> <P> The approval process for the construction of California 56 West is reaching a  critical milestone. On Sept. 13, the California Coastal Commission will hold a  public hearing to review the environmental impact report for the California 56  West-Carmel Valley Restoration and Enhancement Project.  </P> <P> Along with this EIR, the commission will hear testimony on the Interstates 5  and 805 widening and the California 56 and I-5 interchange.  </P> <P> California 56 is a regional solution, the only solution. Adopted by the State  Highway Commission in 1965 and consistent with the 1989 regional transportation  plan, it has always been regarded as a vital east-west transportation link. The  voters of San Diego also regard California 56 as a regional road. In 1987, both  California 56 West and California 56 East received overwhelming approval as  part of the 1987 Proposition A half-cent sales-tax measure for transportation  projects.  </P> <P> Currently, there is no east-west freeway between California 52 and California  78, a gap of 22 miles. It is a gap that forces regional traffic onto local  streets and arterials, a gap that adds to overwhelming congestion on I-5 and  I-805 in the west and I-15 in the east, a gap that affects public safety by  severely increasing response times for the Highway Patrol and police and fire  departments.  </P> <P> California 56 West will convert a 1.8-mile section of Carmel Valley Road into a  four-lane freeway. It will re-create a biologically enhanced drainage and  sediment control channel and also modify a small portion of development area  and land use in North City West and Sorrento Hills.  </P> <P> Without California 56, there will be a complete breakdown at the I-5 and Carmel  Valley Road interchange, with traffic volume estimated at 2,500 cars per hour.  Additionally, forecasts show that the main lanes of I-5 would experience  extended breakdowns during peak hours.  </P> <P> The intolerable congestion and safety hazards on the I-5 and I-805 interchange  necessitate the road improvements and construction of the dual freeway. The  approval of these two freeway projects is the only answer to the ever-mounting  traffic problems of that area.  </P> <P> HANNAH S.

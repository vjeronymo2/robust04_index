			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Hedging options I BOUGHT my detached bungalow in 1986. A few months later, a new owner bought the bungalow next door. Both were built about 20 years ago and the deeds specify that a party hedge shall separate them. The very first owner of the adjoining property planted a beech hedge along the approximate boundary line, and this was about 4 ft high in 1986. Since then, the new neighbour has allowed his side of it to grow to about 7 ft between the back gardens and 6 ft between those at the front. What is the legal position about party hedge heights? Can I cut down my neighbour's half to the original height? Must I notify him of my intention? Unless the title deeds specify a maximum height for the hedge, you cannot insist on your neighbour keeping his side of it to any particular height. It would be a trespass if you were to cut your neighbour's half. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gandhi Montoya; from the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>   [Text] The wave of death threats by clandestine sectors  against public personalities also reached President Dr. Armando  Calderon Sol, who said today that this form of intimidation will  not make him relent from his efforts to consolidate peace and  democracy in El Salvador.    The president asked people to be sensible, to have common  sense, and to have confidence in the country's institutions, and  not to be alarmed by a simple telephone call making a death  threat. Calderon Sol referred to the incident during a news  conference in the National Assembly where he went to request  permission to leave the country.    This is Dr. Armando Calderon Sol's first visit to the  deputies in his role as constitutional president. On Thursday  the president went to request permission to travel to Latin  America and the Caribbean during 1994. After his request was  ratified, the president met with the press. This is when he  disclosed that he had received threats.    [Begin Calderon Sol recording] During all my political  career  I have been the victim of and have suffered much from  disinformation, all sorts of threats. You were witnesses of how  it was said that there were explosives in my office when I was  mayor of San Salvador -- anyway, we have had everything.  Nothing intimidates me, nothing scares me. I know that my work  and my efforts are for the sake of the Salvadoran people, for  the most needy. [end recording]    Thus, the president joins the list of officials, such as the  Ombudsman and Deputy Milena de Escalon, who have also received  death threats these last few days.    Regarding another issue, President Calderon Sol referred to  the imminent appointment of the new PNC [National Civilian  Police] director and he mentioned two of the candidates with the  most possibilities -- PNC Administrative Chief Rodrigo Avila,  but especially National Public Security Academy Director Dr.  Mario Bolanos.    [Begin Calderon Sol recording] Dr. Bolanos is being  considered; he is doing an excellent job. The academy is worthy  of recognition not only nationally but internationally as well.  The countries that are cooperating and helping with technical  missions recognize the effort and the work done in the police  academy. [end recording]    The president also announced that he will travel on Sunday  to  Costa Rica to meet with his Central American colleagues to  prepare a joint document in connection with the region's  sustained development to be presented at the Ibero-American  Summit next week in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia.</p>

			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES COUNTY'S EIGHTY-SIX CITIES  </P> <P> Los Angeles was the first city in the county to incorporate -- in 1850 -- with  Diamond Bar trailing 139 years later, to become the 86th city earlier this  year. The date next to each city reflects the year that city was incorporated.  Here is how each was named.  </P> <P> Agoura Hills (1982) -- In 1924 the town was called Independent Acres, but the  name was later changed to Picture City in honor of Paramount Picture Corp.,  which purchased the property. The name Agoura comes from the Pierre Agoure  family, whose ranch encompassed 16,880 acres of Rancho Las Virgenes.  </P> <P> Alhambra (1903) -- Named by the city's "founding father," Benjamin D. Wilson,  who also was known as "Don Benito." Wilson bought the land for $2.50 an acre in  1874 from the Indian widow of landowner Hugo Reid. Wilson's daughters had been  reading Washington Irving's "The Alhambra," about the legends of the Moorish  palace in Spain, and suggested the name for its romantic quality.  </P> <P> Arcadia (1903) -- Named by Herman J. Unruh, manager of Elias Jackson (Lucky)  Baldwin's Rancho Santa Anita. The 8,030-acre rancho was purchased in 1875 for  $200,000 from Harris Newmark, who had bought it a few years earlier for  $85,000. Records are not clear, but the community may have been named for Dona  Arcadia Bandini Stearns, regarded as one of the most beautiful belles of Los  Angeles in the mid-1800s.  </P> <P> Artesia (1959) -- In 1869, Abel Stearns, a great landowner and one-time husband  of Dona Arcadia Bandini Stearns, sold 1,600 acres of his Rancho Los Coyotes to  a Mr. Gridley. In 1875 the Artesia Land Co. was formed and purchased 550 acres  of present-day Artesia. The community was so named because of its abundance of  artesian wells.  </P> <P> Avalon (1913) -- One of the first names applied to this Santa Catalina Island  community was Roussillon Bay. In the mid-1850s, it became known as Timms  Landing, Timms Cove and Timms Bay, reflecting the influence of Augustus W.  Timms, a major competitor to shipping magnate Phineas Banning. In 1887, George  R. Shatto and his wife bought the island for $200,000 and decided on the name  Avalon because it was the legendary Elysium of King Arthur -- a Celtic paradise  where Arthur and other heroes are taken after death.  </P> <P> Azusa (1898) -- Derived from the Gabrielino Indian word asuka-gna, meaning  "skunk hill." A nearby boom town called Gladstone -- named in 1887 after  British statesman William Ewart Gladstone, who happened to be visiting at the  time -- enjoyed brief prosperity before being added to Azusa's turf.  </P> <P> Baldwin Park (1956) -- Named for Elias Jackson (Lucky) Baldwin, owner of the  8,030-acre Rancho Santa Anita. Lucky, whose fortune stemmed from the discovery  of vast silver deposits, was known as a hard-headed opportunist and one of the  biggest tycoons in the West. The city of Baldwin Park was developed around the  Pacific Electric station, built in 1912.  </P> <P> Bell (1927) -- The area was known as Obed until 1898, when James G. Bell and  his son, Alphonzo Edward Bell, founders of the town, changed the name to match  theirs. The Bells were prosperous farmers, cattle ranchers and developers who  also founded Santa Fe Springs and Bel-Air.  </P> <P> Bellflower (1957) -- Originally called Somerset, the name was changed in 1909  by developer Frank E. Woodruff. It was suggested by William S. Gregory, who  owned an orchard of Bellflower apple trees in the region. Early on, Bellflower  used the slogan, "Twenty-Nine Churches, No Jails."  </P> <P> Bell Gardens (1961) -- In 1930, vegetable gardens that had been developed by  Japanese entrepreneurs were subdivided and named after nearby Bell.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills (1914) -- Oil tycoon and city founder Burton Green named this  community after Beverly, Mass., a quaint Atlantic coast town 25 miles north of  Boston. Green, who had read that President William Howard Taft was planning a  vacation in the East Coast Beverly, adopted that name for his new community of  lush parks and tree-lined streets in the hope of luring the President there. By  1911, only six houses -- on one-acre lots -- had been built on the 4,539 acres  of lima bean fields. Back then, the homes sold for $300 to $1,000.  </P> <P> Bradbury (1957) -- Named for Lewis and Simona Bradbury, who moved to the San  Gabriel Valley from Oakland for a breath of fresh air. (Lewis had severe  asthma.) They purchased the property, once part of the original Rancho Duarte,  at the turn of the century.  </P> <P> Burbank (1911) -- In 1867, Dr. David Burbank, a dentist from New Hampshire,  purchased a section of Rancho Providencia from two Anglos, one of whom was  James G. Bell, for 37 1/2 cents an acre. In 1870 Burbank bought a section of  Rancho San Rafael. After 16 years of operating his two tracts as a sheep ranch,  he sold the property to the Providencia Land, Water &amp; Development Co.,  which turned it into Burbank.  </P> <P> Carson (1968) -- Part of the Rancho San Pedro and one of the few Spanish land  grants to remain for generations in possession of the same family -- the  Dominguez family -- which to this day has extensive land holdings in the area.  The community was named for George Henry Carson, who married one of Don Manuel  Dominguez's six daughters and managed the rancho after his father-in-law's  death. The name Carson is said to have won out over Dominguez simply because it  was easier to spell.  </P> <P> Cerritos (1956) -- Part of a land grant turned over to Manuela Nieto in 1834.  The city's name was changed on March 1, 1966, from Dairy Valley to Cerritos,  which means "the little hills" in Spanish.  </P> <P> Claremont (1907) -- Henry A. Palmer, land owner and investor in the Pacific  Land &amp; Improvement Co., a subsidiary of the Santa Fe Railroad, suggested  the name, which also was the name of a district in Oakland, where he once  lived.  </P> <P> Commerce (1960) -- Originally known as Billy Goat Acres, the area that was  destined to become Commerce served as an anchor station along El Camino Real  (The King's Highway), a trail blazed by Father Junipero Serra to connect the  missions between San Diego and Sonoma. In 1887, the Atchison, Topeka &amp;  Santa Fe Railway built its main line in Commerce. Later, industrial leaders  banded together with residents to encourage commerce and decided the name  should be changed to match that goal.  </P> <P> Compton (1888) -- Purchased in 1865 for 36 cents an acre by John Temple, who  quickly unloaded it for a whopping $5 an acre to G. D. Compton, for whom it is  now named. The original settlers in Comptonville were required to abstain from  alcoholic beverages.  </P> <P> Covina (1901) -- One theory has it that the founder of Covina, Joseph Samuel  Phillips, who subdivided part of his 2,000-acre holdings into present-day  Covina, gave the community its name, which translates as "cove of vineyards."  It is said that Phillips considered that a fitting name for the region because  it was 'cove-like' compared to the nearby mountains and had many abandoned  vines, which had been planted by Costa Rican immigrants. But, some historians  say the name Covina closely matches a word in the language of the Gabrielino  Indians.  </P> <P> Cudahy (1960) -- One square mile of Rancho San Antonio was purchased in 1906 by  the Michael Cudahy family (of meatpacking fame). Cudahy Road was later renamed  Atlantic Boulevard.  </P> <P> Culver City (1917) -- Named for Harry H. Culver, a civic leader and developer  who came from Nebraska in 1914 and subdivided part of the territory from the  Ballona land grant.  </P> <P> Diamond Bar (1989) -- Named in 1918 by Fredrick Lewis, whose ranch was part of  Rancho Los Nogales. Lewis used his branding iron, with its symbol of a diamond  over a bar, to name the town.  </P> <P> Downey (1956) -- In 1873, John Gately Downey, an Irish immigrant and governor  of California from 1860 to 1862, subdivided with James McFarland a portion of  the Santa Gertrudis rancho and gave this town his name.  </P> <P> Duarte (1957) -- Andres Avelino Duarte, a Mexican army corporal, patrolled the  San Gabriel Mission property in the 1830s as far east as the Indian village of  San Bernardino. On each trip he stopped to water his horse at the San Gabriel  River (where Arrow Highway is today) and became more and more enamored of a  stretch of land west of the river bank. Duarte's petition (for what?), seeking  almost 7,000 acres, was granted on May 10, 1841.  </P> <P> El Monte (1912) -- Named Lexington in 1851 by Capt. J. A. Johnson, who hailed  from Lexington, Ky. It was renamed in 1868 by Spanish settlers who referred to  it as "The Monte" because of its high meadows and abundant willows. El Monte  has since been designated as the city at the end of the Santa Fe Trail.  </P> <P> El Segundo (1917) -- The phrase used by a Col. Rheem to describe Standard Oil  Co.'s second refinery, which means "the second" in Spanish. (Standard's first  refinery in California was in Richmond.)  </P> <P> Gardena (1930) -- Local legend has it that Spencer R. Thorpe, credited with  starting the first settlement, named the town because he thought it was a  beautiful garden spot.  </P> <P> Glendale (1906) -- Known as Riverdale in 1874, this community ran into an  identity crisis early on -- the Post Office refused to recognize the name  because there was already a Riverdale in Fresno County. At a meeting of  settlers in 1883, Riverdale was changed to Glendale, following the proposal of  a woman artist from Chicago. In a sense, the name is somewhat redundant since  glen means "a narrow secluded valley" and dale also means "valley."  </P> <P> Glendora (1911) -- The name was coined in 1887 by Chicago manufacturer and town  founder George Whitcomb, who combined the term glen (to connote the adjacent  terrain) with the last two syllables of the name of his wife: Leadora.  </P> <P> Hawaiian Gardens (1964) -- Credit for naming this community belongs to an  enterprising (but unknown) businessman who turned a bamboo shack into a  refreshment stand at the corner of Carson and Norwalk boulevards in 1927.  Travelers on the Santa Fe Trail often said the stand resembled a Hawaiian  garden. The name stuck.  </P> <P> Hawthorne (1922) -- This city received its name around 1906 after Laurine H.  Woolwind, daughter of H. D. Harding, one of the town's founders, suggested that  the community be named for novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne.  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach (1907) -- From the Spanish word for beautiful, the term was used  by the Hermosa Beach Land &amp; Water Co. in 1901 to advertise the property. In  an appeal to the more snooty settlers, Hermosa Beach used to call itself, "The  Aristocrat of the California Beaches."  </P> <P> Hidden Hills (1961) -- A 2,000-member community west of Woodland Hills, it was  named by A. E. Hansen because the hills shield the area from nearby roads.  </P> <P> Huntington Park (1906) -- Named in 1903 by developers E. V. Baker and A. L.  Burbank (apparently no relation to dentist David Burbank) for Henry E.  Huntington, promoter of most of the electric railroads in Southern California  and best remembered as the patron of the Huntington Library and Art Gallery in  San Marino.  </P> <P> Industry (1957) -- Undeveloped land in the La Puente Valley became incorporated  for the main purpose of industrial development.  </P> <P> Inglewood (1908) -- In 1887, this land was part of the Centinela and Sausal  Redondo ranchos, of which Daniel Freeman owned about 25,000 acres. Freeman  wanted to name the town Centinela, but he sold 11,000 acres to a land company,  and it is said that the town was named by the sister-in-law of one of the  promoters, N. R. Vail, who was visiting from Inglewood, Canada.  </P> <P> Irwindale (1957) -- Named in 1899 by a citrus grower whose last name was Irwin  and whose daughter's name was Dale. Irwin's only claim to fame was owning the  first gasoline pump in the area.  </P> <P> La Canada Flintridge (1976) -- La Canada means valley, glen, or dell in  Spanish. Flintridge was part of the La Canada and San Pasqual ranchos and named  by U.S. Sen. Frank Putnam Flint in 1920 when it was subdivided.  </P> <P> La Habra Heights (1978) -- Part of the La Canada del Habra land grant in 1839.  Habra means gorge or pass, referring to the passage through the Puente Hills.  "Heights" was added to distinguish the community behind the hills from La Habra  in Orange County.  </P> <P> La Mirada (1960) -- A Spanish word meaning glance or gaze. The area was an  olive grove when it was subdivided in 1953. The community incorporated as  Mirada Hills, but the voters changed their minds -- and the name -- that same  year.  </P> <P> La Puente (1956) -- This community apparently got its name because of some  early handiwork by members of the Gaspar de Portola expedition, which camped  near San Jose Creek on July 30, 1769. In order to cross the creek, the group  had to build a bridge, or puente. The construction project is mentioned in the  early writings of the expedition.  </P> <P> La Verne (1906)-Known in 1886 as Lordsburg, for real estate investor I.W.Lord,  who laid out the town. In 1917, after Lord's death, the name was changed to La  Verne, a French term meaning "growing green" by Mrs. L. H. Bixby, whose family  owned a large citrus ranch.  </P> <P> (The remaining 43 cities will be listed Wednesday.)  </P> <P> Sources: The Dictionary of California Land Names by Phil Townsend Hanna;  California Place Names by Erwin G.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- A subcommittee of the ruling  coalition proposed that 92 government-backed corporations be  abolished or consolidated in the coming years as part of  administrative and fiscal reforms, according to an interim  report made Thursday [2 June].    The group is expected to submit a final report on the  subject  on June 9 to the coalition's consultation group on tax reforms.    The group offered no conclusion in its report on the  proposed  establishment of a Public Works Ministry to consolidate six  ministries and agencies, including the Construction Ministry,  the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry and the  National Land Agency.    It proposed reorganization of government-backed  corporations,  such as Housing and Urban Development Corp., under these and  other principles:    -- Those engaged in similar business activities should be  consolidated.    -- Those operating in local regions should be reorganized  into a national corporation.    -- Those that can achieve financial independence should be  privatized.</p>

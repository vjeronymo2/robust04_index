			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Price of cobalt up sharply The free market price of cobalt has soared by more than one-third in the past three days, traders reported yesterday. Cobalt - a hard metal used in superalloys in such things as cutting tools, high-strength magnets and jet engines, as a powder in catalysts for the oil and man-made fibre industries and in radial tyres - had jumped from USDollars 11 a pound on Friday morning to Dollars 15 by yesterday afternoon. 'In less than a week the whole wind direction has changed. What was a buyers' market is now one where consumers are scrambling to buy,' said Mr Nick French, a director of Wogen Resources, the London-based minor metals trader. He said the writing had been on the wall for some months because both producer and consumer stocks were low, little cobalt was emerging from Russia, and traders, who burned their fingers when they misjudged the extent of the recent fall in price - it has come down from Dollars 30 two years ago to a low between Dollars 9 and Dollars 10 a pound - had not had the confidence to stock up. Prices were driven down by the sudden appearance of Russia as an exporter after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Cobalt is produced mainly as a by-product of copper and nickel.</p>

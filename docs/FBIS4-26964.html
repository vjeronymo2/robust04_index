			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by staff reporters from Taipei and Shanghai: "Deng </F> Xiaoping Did Go to Shanghai in April"]    [Text] An informed source in Shanghai has confirmed that  Deng Xiaoping, mainland "chief architect of reform and opening  up," did visit Shanghai in April this year and stayed in the  city for two weeks.    Deng Xiaoping stayed at the Shanghai Xijiao Hotel and,  because the hotel was heavily guarded, ordinary people did not  know that the "revered Mr. Deng" had arrived, the informed  source pointed out. CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin inspected  Shanghai from 26 April to 6 May, during which time Deng Xiaoping  was in Shanghai. A XINHUA report said that Jiang Zemin went to  Shanghai to carry out investigations and study in grass-roots  units on reform, opening up, economic development, and social  stability. Obviously, this had something to do with Deng  Xiaoping's tour of Shanghai.    While in Shanghai, Jiang Zemin stressed that the CPC Central  Committee's policy of supporting Pudong's opening up and  development would not change. When inspecting Guangdong from  mid to late June, he also expressed important views on special  economic zones' economic development. Shanghai and special  economic zones in Guangdong are the focus of economic  development in south China, to which Deng Xiaoping pays much  attention. The "revered Mr. Deng," we believe, fully supports  Jiang Zemin's speech which represents the central policy.</p>

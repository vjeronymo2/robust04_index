			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RANGE ROVER TO SET UP SUBSIDIARY IN CANADA  </P> <P> Range Rover of North America Inc. said it will establish a Canadian subsidiary  to market its British-built four-wheel-drive luxury vehicle by mid-1990.  </P> <P> The decision to enter the Canadian market follows three years of sales in the  United States, which has become the largest export market for Range Rover, the  Lanham, Md., company said.  </P> <P> Initial plans call for Range Rover to establish six dealers in major  metropolitan areas across Canada, with the subsidiary headquartered in Toronto,  the company said.  </P> <P> Those dealers will most probably already be in the business of selling European  luxury cars, said Roger J. Ball, named general manager of the new unit.  </P> <P> No sales forecasts or pricing for the Canadian market were disclosed.  </P></p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / International Company News: Cimpor approved to bid for Spanish group CIMENTOS de Portugal (Cimpor), one of Portugal's largest manufacturing companies, has won approval from the Spanish government to launch a takeover bid for Corporacion Noroeste, the cement producer from Galicia. The Portuguese company which holds almost 25 per cent of CN, will pay about Pta24.3bn (Dollars 266m) on the basis of an offer of Pta37,100 per CN share for over 654,000 shares. If successful, it will give Cimpor control of CN. The bid is supported by a financial syndicate including Portugal's Banco de Fomento Exterior which will provide Pta12.26bn, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (Pta9bn), Banco Luso-Espanhol (Pta1.75bn), and Banco de Extremadura (Pta1.25bn). At the end of August, Cimpor bought 24.9 per cent of CN for about Pta8bn. The company says that it has reached agreement with shareholders controlling 25.7 per cent of CN. Cimpor must formally announce its bid in a national Spanish newspaper, after which it will have 30 days to complete the transaction. As part of its takeover offer, the Portuguese company undertakes to launch within six months a bid for Cementos Cosmos, another Spanish cement producer, in which CN has a large stake. Cimpor's decision to acquire manufacturing facilities outside Portugal came as a surprise in view of its forthcoming privatisation.</p>

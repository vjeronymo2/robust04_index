			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For research involving animals, which are of a size or have growth requirements that preclude the use of conventional primary containment systems used for small laboratory animals, four biosafety levels (BL1&hyph;N through BL4&hyph;N) are described in Appendix Q. BL1&hyph;N describes containment for animals that have been modified by stable introduction of recombinant DNA, or DNA derived therefrom, into the germ-line (transgenic animals) and experiments involving viable recombinant DNA-modified microorganisms and is designed to eliminate the possibility of sexual transmission of the modified genome or transmission of recombinant DNA-derived viruses known to be transmitted from animal parent to offspring only by sexual reproduction. Procedures, practices, and facilities follow classical methods of avoiding genetic exchange between animals. BL2&hyph;N describes containment which is used for transgenic animals associated with recombinant DNA-derived organisms and is designed to eliminate the possibility of vertical or horizontal transmission. Procedures, practices, and facilities follow classical methods of avoiding genetic exchange between animals or controlling arthropod transmission. BL3&hyph;N and BL4&hyph;N describe higher levels of containment for research with certain transgenic animals involving agents which pose recognized hazard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In constructing the NIH Guidelines, it was necessary to define boundary conditions for the different levels of physical and biological containment and for the classes of experiments to which they apply. These definitions do not take into account all existing and anticipated information on special procedures that will allow particular experiments to be conducted under different conditions than indicated here without affecting risk. Individual investigators and Institutional Biosafety Committees are urged to devise simple and more effective containment procedures and to submit recommended changes in the NIH Guidelines to permit the use of these procedures.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Amendment to Section III, Experiments Covered by the NIH Guidelines  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The previous version of Section III-A&hyph;2 will be deleted as follows: Section III-A&hyph;2. Deliberate release into the environment of any organism containing recombinant DNA except those listed below. The term `deliberate release' is defined as a planned introduction of recombinant DNA-containing microorganisms, plants, or animals into the environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III-A&hyph;2-a. Introduction conducted under conditions considered to be accepted scientific practices in which there is adequate evidence of biological and/or physical control of the recombinant DNA-containing organisms. The nature of such evidence is described in Appendix L.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III-A&hyph;2-b. Deletion derivatives and single base changes not otherwise covered by the NIH Guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III-A&hyph;2-c. For extrachromosomal elements and microorganisms (including viruses), rearrangements and amplifications within a single genome. Rearrangements involving the introduction of DNA from different strains of the same species would not be covered by this exemption.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amended version of Section III reads as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III. Experiments Covered by the NIH Guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This section describes five categories of experiments involving recombinant DNA: (i) Those that require RAC review and NIH and Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation (see Section III-A), (ii) those that require NIH/ORDA and Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation (see Section III-B); (iii) those that require Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation (see Section III-C), (iv) those that require Institutional Biosafety Committee notification simultaneous with initiation (see Section III-D), and (v) those that are exempt from the NIH Guidelines (see Section III-E).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> If an experiment falls into either Section III-A or Section III-B and one of the other categories, the rules pertaining to Section III-A or Section III-B shall be followed. If an experiment falls into Section III-E and into either Sections III-C or III-D categories as well, the experiment is considered exempt from the NIH Guidelines.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any change in containment level, which is different from those specified in the NIH Guidelines, may not be initiated without the express approval of NIH/ORDA (see Minor Actions, Section IV-C&hyph;1-b-(2) and its subsections).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section III&hyph;A. Experiments That Require Institutional Biosafety Committee Approval, RAC Review, and NIH Approval Before Initiation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Experiments in this category are considered Major Actions (see Section IV-C&hyph;1-b-(1)) and cannot be initiated without submission of relevant information on the proposed experiment to the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496&hyph;9838, the publication of the proposal in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for 15 days of comment, reviewed by the RAC, and specific approval by the NIH (not applicable for Expedited Review single patient human gene transfer experiments considered under Appendix M-VI). The containment conditions for such experiments will be recommended by the RAC and set by the NIH at the time of approval. Such experiments require Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation. Specific experiments already approved are included in Appendix D which may be obtained from the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496&hyph;9838.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Boeing takes tougher line in Airbus subsidy row MR Frank Shrontz, chairman of US aircraft manufacturer Boeing, yesterday launched his most comprehensive attack yet on alleged government subsidies to Europe's Airbus Industrie, and warned that American rival McDonnell Douglas must not become an 'Asian Airbus', subsidised by Taiwan. 'Airbus and the European Community should understand our position,' he said in a speech in New York. 'Twenty-one years of subsidy is far too much. Enough is enough.' He repeated a threat of retaliatory action under US law as a 'last resort' if the issue could not be resolved through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). The broadside follows five years of slow movement in two cases brought by the US under the Gatt, seeking to prevent EC members from subsidising Airbus  -which has become the world's second largest civil aircraft manufacturer. The US claims the subsidies total about Dollars 8m (Pounds 4.4m) for every aircraft Airbus has sold. Mr Shrontz also voiced concern over a plan for state-backed Taiwan Aerospace to take a 40 per cent equity stake in McDonnell Douglas's civil aircraft business.</p>

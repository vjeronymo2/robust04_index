			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-Lap Lam] </F>   [Text] A major paradox of Chinese politics is that the  titles and perquisites of would-be helmsman Jiang Zemin have  grown at the same rate that affairs of state have become more  rudderless.    In the early 1980s, New Helmsman Deng Xiaoping told  foreigners he had no worries because his two lieutenants, then  party boss Hu Yaobang and then premier Zhao Ziyang could  "prevent the heavens from falling".    Can President and party General Secretary Jiang hold up the  sky? Events since late last year have shown that Mr Jiang, who  is also Chairman of the Central Military Commission [CMC] and  head of the party's Leading Group on Finance and Economics, has  been less than adept at preventing the ship of state from  lunging first to port, then to starboard.    Such flip-flops include Beijing's half-hearted pursuit of  the  austerity programme in the third quarter of 1993 and so far this  year.    Western economists have also been baffled by the  authorities'  lily-livered efforts to restructure the ailing state  enterprises. Calls made last November for radical surgery have  metamorphosed into Premier Li Peng's warning last week "not to  draw an equation mark between state-owned firms and economically  inefficient enterprises".    Cynics have cited Mr Jiang's lack-lustre performance as  party  boss and mayor of Shanghai from 1986 to 1989 and his uneventful  stint in the Ministry of Electronics from 1982 to 1985.    An equally plausible explanation, however, may be that Mr  Jiang, who is also the head of the party's Leading Group on  Taiwan Affairs and Honorary President of the China Software  Industry Association, might be too busy pursuing portfolios and  peddling influence.    Analysts were flabbergasted to learn last month that the  supremo had put one more feather in his cap: Honorary Chairman  of the China Red Cross. Attempts, however, by Mr Jiang to draw  the 3.2 million-strong People's Liberation Army (PLA) into his  fiefdom have raised the most eyebrows. Beijing tabled bills this  month specifying that the CMC chairman must be a cadre without  military insignia, and that the position of first-grade general  be abolished. This was interpreted as a move to shore up Mr  Jiang, who has no army credentials.    In addition to installing cronies to key PLA slots, Mr Jiang  has pulled out all the stops to ensure the loyalty of the  People's Armed Police (PAP).    Since Tiananmen Square, the brief of the PAP, whose strength  is estimated at 800,000, has been changed to quelling "internal  disorders". The para-military force has thus become a potent  weapon in the post-Deng power struggle.    PAP Commander Ba Zhongtan, a Jiang appointee, scandalised  his  less-politicised colleagues recently by asserting that the first  duty of his force was to "protect party and state leaders", an  unsubtle reference to mentor Mr Jiang. Analysts said General  Ba's statement was tantamount to former Chief Political  Commissar General Yang Baibing's claim in 1992 that the PLA's  main task was to provide "an imperial escort" for Mr Deng's  southern China tour, when radical reform initiatives were  unveiled.    Though Mr Jiang is but a helmsman in waiting, he and his  personal office have built up a personality cult worthy of that  of Great Helmsman Mao Zedong. After Mr Jiang's "triumphant  summit" with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Seattle last  November, PLA commissars urged the generals to heap praise in  internal meetings on the statesmanlike exploits of the  "President of the Republic". Last June, Mr Jiang fired the chief  editors of the People's Liberation Army Daily for lese-majeste,  putting his interview with CNN on the back page.    During this year's Lunar New Year, Mr Jiang hosted a banquet  for the editors of the national media in an apparent effort to  boost his already ubiquitous profile. Chinese journalists say  that not since Chairman Mao has a top cadre issued so many  personal directives to newspapers and TV stations.    The President's most recent instruction to party and media  is  reportedly an eight-point exhortation on preventing unrest,  boosting agriculture, pacifying laid-off workers, and curbing  corruption. Yet like all Jiang-inspired propaganda, the edict  bore this overriding theme: highlight the president's status as  the "core" of the new leadership and Mr Deng's anointed heir.    Which leads us to a paradox in recent Chinese history:  unlike  Mr Hu or Mr Zhao, Mr Jiang was not Mr Deng's personal choice as  successor. In the heady days of the 1989 "turmoil", Mr Deng  acquiesced in the recommendation of conservative elders such as  Li Xiannian and Chen Yun that "trustworthy Marxist" Mr Jiang  took over from Mr Zhao.    From then till the death of his chief patron Mr Li in  mid-June, Mr Jiang displayed his expertise at what the Chinese  call fengpei ("Wind Faction") politics by bending now with the  New Helmsman and now with the former state president.    His "protege's" failure to help propagate a new wave of  reform was a key reason why Mr Deng needed to go south in early  1992 to proselytize to Guangdong's capitalist roaders.    Luck, which is as important to Mr Jiang's rise as palace  intrigues, however, is with the president.    After Mr Li's death, the Wind Faction affiliate knew his  fate  was linked with that of Mr Deng. And Mr Jiang began at least to  make the right noises about market reforms.    A senior Chinese source said if Mr Li had died a year later  -- and Mr Jiang gone on with his duplicitous game of pleasing  two masters -- Mr Deng would have dumped him in late 1992 or  early 1993.    By late 1993, however, a pathetically frail Mr Deng had  become a hostage of history. With "stability" uppermost in his  mind, the patriarch could not but continue to funnel support to  one of the few leaders who had sworn he would never overturn the  verdict on June 4.    Also by then, however, it had become apparent that the  mantle  thrust upon Mr Jiang was way too big for the 68-year-old. It is  Mr Jiang who, playing fengpai politics to the hilt, is  responsible for some of the most maddening tergiversations in  policy.    The first signal that the retrenchment policy of  Vice-Premier  Zhu Rongji was being watered down came when, visiting southern  China last September, Mr Jiang told the local "warlords" they  could again go for no-holds-barred development.    On the eve of the watershed party Third Plenum last  November,  a pro-Beijing paper in Hong Kong trumpeted how Mr Jiang helped  to "liberate our thoughts" by no longer insisting that state  enterprises be the mainstay of the economy.    The shift to bailing out the dinosaurs, however, was also  made by Mr Jiang, who told cadres in Shanxi province in February  that Beijing would "provide necessary assistance and support" to  the country's least efficient sector.</p>

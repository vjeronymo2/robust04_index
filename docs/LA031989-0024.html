			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD: GOAT-CHEESE FLAN;  </P> <P> MABE'S CHEF OFFERS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA A FIRST COURSE THAT'S SOUTHERN FRANCE  </P> <P> GOAT-CHEESE FLAN is definitely Southern France," says Claude Segal, Paris-born  executive chef at Mabe restaurant and a chef who's been around some: Ciboulet,  Maxim's and L'Archestrat in Paris; Ma Maison, Bistango and The Four Oaks in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> By definition, flan is a molded custard that's made with eggs and cream or  milk. It is customarily served cold. When cheese, meat, fish or vegetables are  introduced into the custard base, flan can also be served warm. Segal, however,  likes the idea of a cold flan because it can be made days ahead. "In fact," he  says, "the flan tastes better if flavors are allowed to mellow for a day or  two."  </P> <P> Segal's Goat-Cheese Flan can be served as a first course over baby greens, as  prepared at Mabe, or, because of its dense texture, can be formed into finger  or roll shapes as appetizers. Segal recommends a Chardonnay wine, California or  French, to accompany Goat-Cheese Flan as a first course. For an entree to  follow he suggests "a strong-flavored meat, perhaps roast lamb."  </P> <P> CLAUDE SEGAL'S GOAT-CHEESE FLAN  </P> <P> 2 cloves garlic  </P> <P> 2 red peppers  </P> <P> 2 yellow peppers  </P> <P> 1 (7-ounce) package fresh goat cheese  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons creme fraiche  </P> <P> 6 green basil leaves  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons lemon juice  </P> <P> Olive oil  </P> <P> 6 purple basil leaves  </P> <P> 2 cups torn mixed baby lettuces  </P> <P> Finely cracked black pepper  </P> <P> Roast garlic and red and yellow peppers.

Repeat with yellow peppers and remaining clove garlic.  Set aside.  </P> <P> By hand, blend goat cheese until smooth. Add creme fraiche and mix until  smooth. Add green basil and 1 teaspoon lemon juice and mix well. Stir in diced  red and yellow peppers.  </P> <P> Grease 6 individual flan molds with olive oil.

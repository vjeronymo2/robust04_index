The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which published the survey, described the mood among its members as grim.

Workloads over the year had fallen by 12 per cent. The institution said that 19 per cent of firms expected to shed labour during the next 12 months. Much of quantity surveying work occurs early in the construction process. Order books therefore provide one of the best early indicators of future workloads in the industry. The report prompted further pleas to the government not to cut capital investment in transport and housing when it announces its unified Budget at the end of this month. Mr Christopher Vickers, a senior partner at EC Harris, one of the largest firms of quantity surveyors, said: 'The effects would be disastrous for the construction industry, causing more redundancies in a sector which has already lost more than 400,000 jobs since summer 1989.' A joint letter to the chancellor from the Building Employers' Confederation and the Federation of Master Builders says that construction output, which has declined by 15 per cent in value since its peak, had fallen for 13 consecutive quarters. It says: 'Given this background we would urge the crucial importance in the unified Budget of maintaining current capital investment programmes.'</p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / International Company News: Newmont Mining reveals 12% drop NEWMONT Mining, the US natural resources company in which financier Sir James Goldsmith holds a 42 per cent stake, turned in a 12 per cent decline in first-quarter net income from continuing operations on sales which fell 9 per cent. For the three months ended March 31, Newmont recorded net income of Dollars 37.4m, or 55 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 151.3m, against Dollars 57.4m, or 85 cents, on sales of Dollars 165.5m a year ago. The 1990 earnings were distorted by income from discontinued operations of Dollars 14.7m, or 22 cents a share, and a one-off after-tax gain of Dollars 10.4m, or 16 cents. Net income from continuing operations was Dollars 37.4m in the 1991 quarter, compared with Dollars 42.7m a year earlier. During the first three months of 1991, the average price Newmont received for gold fell to Dollars 401 an ounce from Dollars 414 an ounce a year earlier. Newmont Mining's 90.1 per cent interest in Newmont Gold contributed Dollars 36.2m in pre-tax income, down 23 per cent from Dollars 46.8m the year before. Newmont Gold received an average of Dollars 373 an ounce for gold in the latest quarter compared with Dollars 404 a year earlier. Sir James acquired his holding in Newmont in October in a Dollars 1.3bn forest-for-gold asset swap with Lord Hanson's UK conglomerate, in which Sir James exchanged his stake in CFI - the major operating business within Goldsmith's Oriental Investments group - for the Newmont holding.</p>

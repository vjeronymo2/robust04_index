			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 13 (KCNA) -- Our side had demanded  that the South Korean side accept through Panmunjom the letter  to the South Korean authorities, political parties,  organisations and individual figures and overseas compatriots  which was adopted at a joint meeting of the government,  political parties and public organisations of the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea on April 11. But, the letter had to  be sent through radio today, since it could not be conveyed to  the addressees due to the untenable act of the South side.    The letter carries a proposal to convene a national  conference in Pyongyang or Seoul around the August 15 National  Liberation Day.    If anyone denies the great unity of the nation, pushing into  the foreground the differences in ideology, idea and political  system even today when the danger of a war, a nuclear war, is  hanging over the head of the nation, it would be a heinous crime  against the nation in seeking confrontation, war and division,  the letter says, and continues:    Out of the desire to carry into practice at an early date  "10- point programme of the great unity of the whole nation for  the reunification of the country," a common guideline and  charter of the nation which would bring unity, peace and  reunification to our nation, we courteously propose the  convocation of a national conference in Pyongyang or Seoul  around August 15, one year before the 50th anniversary of the  liberation of the country.    Representatives of the authorities, political parties and  organisations and individual figures of the North and the South  and representatives of overseas compatriots, who can represent  the will of the whole nation, may participate in the conference  with equal qualification, irrespective of differences in  political view, religious belief, political affiliation and  status, in conformity with its character and purport.    An open-hearted discussion on the questions of peace and  reunification of the country, including practical measures for  promoting the great unity of the whole nation, may take place at  the conference.    If the national conference is convened, people of all strata  and figures of various circles of the North and the South would  open their hearts to each other and confirm that they are  compatriots of the same blood and seek a short cut to  reunification in the 90s by promoting great unity and pooling  the will and wisdom of the nation, transcending differences in  ideology, idea, political view and religious belief.    We think it necessary to form a preparatory committee of the  national conference with five delegates each from the North, the  South and overseas, in order to ensure the success of the  national conference.    The preparatory committee may have its first meeting in  Pyongyang or Seoul in May and decide on the date and place of  the national conference and its mode and discuss other practical  matters arising in the convocation and steering of the  conference.    We think it desirable to have bilateral or multilateral  contacts between compatriots of the North, the South and  overseas for coordinating each other's opinions before the  convocation of the historical national conference.    We express the hope that the compatriots in South Korea and  overseas will actively respond to our proposal for the  convocation of a national conference proceeding from a noble  patriotic stand.</p>

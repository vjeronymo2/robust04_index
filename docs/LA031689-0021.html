			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANDELA AND SOUTH AFRICA  </P> <P> How can we now justify calling for total economic sanctions and total  disinvestment in light of "South Africa's Shame" (editorial, Feb. 21)? Francis  Wilson and Mamphela Ramphele's report claims there are no quick solutions,  including economic sanctions, through which the South African government would  either voluntarily or forcibly be persuaded into negotiating away its position  of power.  </P> <P> Furthermore, the report adds that much can be done to prepare for a more  constructive future. It challenges people to get on with those steps now. The  shape of South African society in the future will depend critically on the  foundation now laid. How can a strong foundation be laid by strangling the very  economy that must assist in laying that foundation? Perhaps it is time to  re-evaluate the call for total economic sanctions and disinvestment from South  Africa.  </P> <P> I lived in Zimbabwe the last three years, lecturing in the College of  Agriculture at the University of Zimbabwe. It became apparent to me that the  major concerns of the government, eight years after independence, were  employment, education and health. This country is now going through a stage of  development that South Africa may well face in the future. There is a race  against time because of the enormous population growth. It has been estimated  that over 50% of the black population in both countries is under 15 years of  age. Surely, the South African children will also need and demand better  opportunities for employment, education and health. How can these be created  without some investment in carefully targeted impact programs in these sectors?  </P> <P> Finally, we must not overlook the interdependence among countries in southern  Africa. Peace and stability in South Africa is interwoven with peace and  stability in southern Africa. We should not let this window of opportunity pass  for stabilization in the region. To facilitate the cause of justice in South  Africa it would, therefore, seem imperative to create opportunities through  selective investments. Clearly, we must re-evaluate the call for total economic  sanctions and total disinvestment.  </P> <P> PHLLIP D. NORTHCRAFT  </P> <P> La Jolla  </P></p>

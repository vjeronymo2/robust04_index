			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Survey of Singapore (12): Airport lounge with designs on the future - Airtropolis IS Airtropolisan ambitious name for an airport? The much-lauded Singapore Changi International airport, which has become a tourist spot, calls for something special. Changi International has been named the world's best airport so many times that, in the month before the second terminal or T2 started operations last November, more than 100,000 people paid to tour the SDollars 650m wonder. 'The word Airtropolis, with a futuristic feel, is one that connotes a very special and exciting place where things happen,' explained Mr Lim Hock San, director-general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore. The two terminals offer the traveller so many services and facilities that a mini-city has emerged. It is design, innovation, and state-of-the-art technology providing speed, efficiency and service to cater to the traveller's every need. Its aim is to allowpassengers to clear immigration, collect their baggage and pass through customsin 20 minutes. Those in transit can use the Changi Skytrain, the first high speed automated passenger transit system outside the US, which connects the two terminals and offers 100 shops, 75 dayrooms, 20 restaurants, business centre, and medical centre. T2 has improved on its predecessor's attractions - from fitness centre, the first in an Asia-Pacific airport, to a multi-purpose hall, valet parking and air-conditioned taxi stand. The secret of Airtropolis is that it was designed with the family in mind. Bored youngsters can use the playroom or Science Discovery Corner while mothers relax at the beauty salon and fathers at the lounge. Business executives can hold conferences or even meet local clients without leaving the terminal. The main complaint about T2 is its size - it is too large, necessitating some walking. However, more space was incorporated into its design. Although it handles the same number of passengers, T2 has 30 per cent more space, some luggage retrieval belts are longer to accommodate baggage from future larger aircraft - its gatehold rooms hold 500, not 300 passengers. The ambience exudes the feeling of space with high ceilings terraced to filter daylight, and glass abounding where possible. Light, warm colours, omnipresent tropical plants and waterfalls banish the sterile,cold look of many airports. T1 was designed to comfortably cope with 10mpassengers with Asia-Pacific's largest passenger handling capacity. It is host to 52 airlines flying to 111 cities in 53 countries. In 1990 there was a 10.5 per cent growth in passengers to 15.6m. passenger handling capacity increased to 24m with the opening of T2, to 36m with T3 by the turn of the century and to 50m with T4. Changi is not resting on its laurels. T1 will undergo a SDollars 121m upgrading to match T2 and cope with a forecast 20m passengers in 1995.</p>

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / International Company News: Degussa up 54% on solid all-round performance Strong earnings in all sectors pushed Degussa's pre-tax profits up 54 per cent to DM186m (Dollars 118.4m) in the first nine months of the current financial year, the metals and chemicals group said yesterday. The improvement, on turnover up just 1 per cent at DM10.9bn, stemmed mainly from North America, Asia and some European countries, while domestic business was still affected by the 'moderate' economic climate, it added. The North American contribution to group sales, excluding precious metals dealings, rose to 15 per cent from 13 per cent, while Asia accounted for 14 per cent after 11 per cent last time. Domestic business generated 34 per cent of turnover compared with 36 per cent. After stripping out improved earnings from precious metals, the metals division returned to break-even after heavy losses last year. The Leybold subsidiary, which is being sold to Switzerland's Oerlikon-Buehrle, returned to profit. However, these earnings were not included in the results. Chemicals sales rose 4 per cent, in line with the west German industry average. Although prices fell slightly, earnings increased markedly due to cost-saving measures and rising foreign demand. Turnover from pharmaceuticals was 6 per cent higher, with about half the increase coming from the first-time consolidation of Elephant, a Dutch dental company. The bottom line was also enhanced by a 9 per cent cut in capital spending, while the rise in group payroll costs was held to 2 per cent. At the end of June, the number employed was 4 per cent lower than a year earlier.</p>

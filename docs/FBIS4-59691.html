			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] The army of constitutional legitimacy and the forces  of unity and democracy are continuing their triumphant advance  to destroy the gang of apostasy and secession and to uphold  unity and the homeland. It is a great mission and objective  sought by every zealous Yemeni citizen who believes in unity.  Therefore, success has been a permanent companion of these  forces in their triumphant unionist march. The misled elements  in the Armed Forces under the hegemony of the gang of apostasy  are confidently siding with the forces of legitimacy, ridding  themselves of the hegemony of the gang of apostasy. They are  sincerely and honestly joining the forces of unity in all  fighting positions and all axes of the great unionist march.  Similar to these unionist stands by the military, the  civilians, too, take the initiative in welcoming the forces of  legitimacy and unity and cooperating with them in their national  unionist mission. They realize that they are forces of  protection, salvation, legitimacy, security, and peace, and  believe that they are forces seeking to entrench unity, support  the pillars of democracy, uphold the word of the people, and rid  them of the renegade gang under which they suffered bitterly.    The citizens have long suffered from the sins of this gang.  Now they realize that the hour of salvation is coming and that  the moment of liberation is imminent, God willing, through the  determination of the free unionists. Accordingly, it is a  foregone conclusion to tell all citizens in the operational  sectors and to all unionists in the Armed Forces axes: These  are your forces which express your ambitions, achieve your  aspirations, work for your salvation, and watch over you and  your interests. They protect you from the evil of the renegade  gang and tyranny. They are your guarantee for a true unionist  future, a just and democratic society, and a free and dignified  life. They are the vanguards of love and peace, harbingers of  concord and order, protectors of unity and democracy, carriers  of the banner of renaissance and development, and guardians of  right and legitimacy. Therefore, the strongholds and  fortifications of apostasy and secession in all positions and  axes are collapsing daily in front of their unionist march  everywhere.    The successes scored by these unionist forces give clear  evidence that the forces of constitutional legitimacy and the  armies of unity and democracy represent the hand of the divine  power, which has ordained that the secessionist parasites be  uprooted and the dens of the renegade gangs be destroyed. They  express the popular will to destroy this gang, get rid of its  evil, and destroy its conspiracy against the homeland, unity,  and democracy. This gang wanted to obliterate others so that it  could control everything and dominate all the people.  Therefore, it had to be removed from the path of the people and  erased from the history of the homeland after suffering from  what it intended for the citizens. This renegade gang wanted to  destroy democracy and foil unity, but God destroyed their  pillars and made them taste grievous punishment. Their end is  imminent, God willing.</p>

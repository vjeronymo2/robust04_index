			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: ``Nuclear Experts Warn: Uncontrolled </F> Economic Processes May Begin'']    [Text] Vasiliy Kotko, deputy chairman of the State  Committee for the Use of Nuclear Power, has deemed as  ``catastrophic'' the current situation in the nuclear power  sector. According to him, there have been no purchases of  nuclear fuel since the middle of 1993 due to a lack of funds.  In 1993, the volume of nuclear fuel purchases decreased  twofold, as compared to 1990. The same reasons hampered the  dumping of nuclear fuel residue.    Kotko points out that the National Control Center of the  Ukrainian Ministry of Power, the committee's primary and only  consumer irregularly pays for received nuclear electric power.  The ministry owes nuclear power stations some 550 billion  karbovanetses.    Kotko underlines that the sector has exhausted its resources  and if the situation remains unchanged uncontrolled processes  will begin. If fuel is not bought the industry will be unable  to function.</p>

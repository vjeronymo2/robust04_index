			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / UK Company News: BDA chairman faces threat of removal Two non-executive directors of BDA Holdings are requisitioning an extraordinary general meeting to oust Mr Brian Duker as chairman and chief executive of the property investment and development group. Mr Richard Wollenberg, BDA's non-executive deputy chairman and Mr Nigel Jamieson together hold about 3.1 per cent of the company, while Mr Wollenberg is also a director of Village Residential, which has a 13 per cent stake. Mr Wollenberg said BDA needed to expand its interests and he had 'lost confidence in Mr Duker's ability to take the company forward'. He claimed support from shareholders, including several large institutions, speaking for 51.33 per cent of the votes. Mr Duker, who controls about 24 per cent of BDA, said he had 'brought the company back from the brink of disaster over the last few years'. He said he would be writing to shareholders in due course. In April, BDA reported a turnround from Pounds 1.16m losses to pre-tax profits of Pounds 152,000 in the year to end January 1994, after a release of property provisions of Pounds 100,000, compared with a Pounds 1.2m charge before.</p>

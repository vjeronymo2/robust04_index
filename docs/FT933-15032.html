			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: German tax bill I OWN Dresdner bank shares and have been unable to find out if I can get relief for the German tax deducted. Presumably, 25 per cent German withholding tax has been deducted from your Dresdner Bank dividends. Two-fifths of this tax is repayable to you, by virtue of article VI of the FRG-UK double taxation convention (as amended in 1970), and the bank which collected the dividends for you will be able to arrange for the appropriate refund from the German tax authorities. You are indeed entitled to relief for the remaining 15 per cent German tax against your UK tax liability, and you might like to ask your tax office for the free booklet on double taxation relief, IR6. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

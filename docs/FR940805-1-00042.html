			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Motor vehicles that are exempted in accordance with rules of the MPCA because the vehicle, although registered to an owner residing in the metropolitan area, is customarily domiciled outside the metropolitan area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Any class of vehicles that is exempted by rule of the MPCA because the vehicles present prohibitive inspection problems, or are inappropriate for inspection. These include vehicles powered solely by diesel fuel, natural gas, propane, pure alcohol, or hydrogen; fire apparatus, ambulances, and rescue vehicles. Vehicles that have been identified as ``dual fuel'' are required to be tested using their gasoline cycle only.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Minnesota SIP submittal provides an estimate of the number of vehicles exempted due to vehicle age, fuel type, and engines type. These exempted vehicles are accounted for in the compliance rate which was used in the Mobile 5a modeling process to demonstrate compliance with the performance standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Test Procedures and Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 51.357 requires SIPs to include a description of each test procedure used, the legal authority or rule describing and establishing the test procedures, and the test standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Minnesota I/M program includes a tampering inspection and an exhaust emission test (Minnesota Rules parts 7023.1025 and 7023.1030). The USEPA  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Checklist <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  lists the criteria that State I/M programs must satisfy in order to be approvable. The Minnesota program satisfies the criteria of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Checklist <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Minnesota Rules pt. 7023.1010, subp. 35 exempts vehicles from testing that are powered solely by diesel fuel, electricity, natural gas, propane, pure alcohol, or hydrogen (alternate fuel vehicles). The State believes and USEPA agrees that there are so few alternate fuel vehicles that there is no significant impact upon ambient air quality. Vehicles that are ``dual fuel''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are tested using the gasoline cycle and must meet the same test requirements as all other vehicles subject to the program requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Minnesota program tests vehicles with exchanged engines that were manufactured before 1976 according to the emission standards applicable to the year of the exchanged engine and tests vehicles where the year of the exchanged engine is unknown according to the standard applicable to 1976 engines. Section 51.357(d)(2) requires vehicles with exchanged engines to be subject to the emission standards based on the chassis type and model year, not the engine year as the Minnesota rule allows. Engine year standards can only be used if the engine is newer than the chassis and subject to stricter emission control requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a letter from Charles Williams, Commissioner MPCA, dated July 5, 1994 to Valdas Adamkus, Regional Administrator, the MPCA committed to requesting statutory and rule amendments that are consistent with USEPA final regulations. USEPA proposes to conditionally approve the SIP based on this commitment. MPCA must submit these amendments as a SIP revision within one year of final conditional approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Test Equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 51.358 of the final rule requires SIPs to include written technical specifications for all test equipment used in the program. The specifications should describe the emission analysis process, the necessary test equipment, the required features, and written acceptance testing criteria and procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix 11 of the Minnesota submittal and Minnesota Rules 7023.1090 contains the specifications for the test equipment used in the I/M program. The gas analyzers used in the program each meet or exceed the California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bureau of Automotive Repair bench specifications and meet or exceed the specifications contained in Appendices A, B, and D of the I/M final rule.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Quality Control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 51.359 of the I/M final regulations requires SIPs to include a description of quality control and recordkeeping procedures. The submittal should include the procedures manual, rule, ordinance, or law establishing the procedures of quality control and recordkeeping.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Minnesota Rules pts. 7023.1010&hyph;7023.1105 and Appendix 11 of the submittal describe the quality control standards and criteria for the I/M program. Specifications for the test equipment used in the I/M program are also located in Appendix 11 of the submittal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Waivers and Compliance via Diagnostic Inspection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 51.360 outlines the standards that State SIP submittals must satisfy before owners of vehicles can be issued waivers or temporary extensions. A waiver or temporary extension allows motorists to renew vehicle registration. These requirements include: a maximum waiver rate used for estimating emission reduction benefits in the modeling analysis; a commitment by the State to take corrective action if the waiver rate exceeds that which was committed to in the SIP or a commitment to revise the SIP and emission reductions claimed; a description of waiver criteria and procedures, including cost limits, quality assurance methods and administration; and the necessary legal authority to issue waivers, set and adjust costs limits and carry out any other functions necessary to administer the waiver system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] NATO's Partnership for Peace program adopted in  Brussels at the proposal of the United States has partially  eased the tension which arose over the intention of several East  European countries to join the bloc. Our correspondent Marina  Chernukha asked Valeriy Manilov, deputy secretary of Russia's  Security Council what consequences this program would have for  Russia.    [Begin Manilov recording] Russia's attitude to this program  is positive. I have in mind the fact that at no stage  whatsoever of the implementation of the Partnership for Peace  program will any steps be taken that will represent a threat to  Russian security. The NATO bloc will not be expanded to the  detriment of the interests and security of Russia. In other  words, states will not be accepted into this organization -- at  least not in haste. By no means all these states have assessed  the idea of partnership and by no means all of them have  approached the idea of partnership from the point of view of  establishing European security as a whole.    The threat arose of the creation of a kind of cordon  sanitaire close to the borders of Russia. We categorically,  very toughly and firmly opposed such a turn of events and the  United States and the NATO leadership have heeded our stance and  taken account of it. And now, what is at issue -- at the level  of political cooperation, at the level of expanding economic  ties, at the level of developing military technical cooperation  -- is the possibility of various states joining this program  over a very prolonged period, as they become ready to do so.    The specific mechanisms for the implementation of this  program still have to be devised in detail -- and this is being  done both in NATO and the United States and in our country. It  is premature to talk of any state implementing it. Russia is  ready, in principle, for cooperation and partnership, even more  so for the sake of peace. We are working to strengthen security  and peace. On what principles? If we are talking of  partnership, then on the principles of equality, mutual benefit,  respect for one another and on no other principles. [end  recording]</p>

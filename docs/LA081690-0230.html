			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: EL MONTE;  </P> <P> PARKING TIME LIMIT LIFTED  </P> <P> Shoppers can take their time and not worry about parking tickets since the City  Council voted Tuesday to remove the two-hour time limit on city lots on the  north and south sides of the Valley Mall between Granada Avenue, Ramona and  Valley boulevards.  </P> <P> The change was made after a request from the Downtown El Monte Business Assn.  The two-hour limit will still apply to street parking on Valley Mall Boulevard.  The ban on parking between 3 and 5 a.m. will continue.  </P></p>

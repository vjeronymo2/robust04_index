			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Chiefs fail to settle Western Sahara poll UN efforts to hold a referendum on the future of the Western Sahara suffered a further setback in Geneva yesterday when the UN special envoy, Mr Sahabzada Yaqub Khan, failed for the second day running to convene a meeting of tribal chiefs from the territory. The meeting, scheduled to start on Monday, was intended to define criteria for deciding who is entitled to vote on the future of the sparsely-inhabited territory. A former Spanish colony, valued mainly for its fisheries and phosphate deposits, it was annexed by Morocco on Spain's withdrawal in 1976. The Algerian-backed Polisario Liberation Front contested the annexation, and fought a desultory guerrilla war against the Moroccans until a UN-brokered ceasefire came into effect in September 1991. Under the UN peace plan, this should have led to a referendum in January this year, with an electoral roll based on the Spanish census of 1974, which showed a population of only 73,500. But after accepting the plan, Morocco produced a list of a further 120,000 people who it said were entitled to vote, claiming they were left out of the census because they or their families had fled from Spanish colonial rule to Morocco proper, and that this should not prejudice their right to a say in the territory's future. In December last year Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, the outgoing UN Secretary General, accepted the argument that 'people who fled colonial rule cannot be deprived of the right to decide on the future of the territory to which they belong', and said this applied also to the children of such people. But, he added, 'in order not to widen excessively the scope of this provision, it has been restricted to one generation only'. Morocco agreed to co-operate on this basis, dropping its insistence on the full list of 120,000. But the Polisario rejected the instructions, saying Morocco would use them as a pretext to import voters who had no real connection with the territory. The idea behind the Geneva meeting, to be attended by 19 chiefs from each side, was that, since Saharan society is essentially nomadic and tribal, tribal chiefs were best placed to know who belonged in Western Sahara and who did not. But at the last minute Polisario objected to seven of the chiefs nominated by Morocco, on the grounds that their names did not figure on a list given to both parties by Mr Perez de Cuellar in 1990. The Polisario leader and president of the self-proclaimed Saharan Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) Mr Mohammed Abdelaziz, admitted during a visit to London last week that he himself does not figure in the Spanish census (he was born in the Moroccan city of Marrakesh), but insisted that a blanket inclusion of anyone whose parents had ever lived in the Western Sahara would be too wide. Politically, neither side can contemplate losing the referendum, which means neither is likely to let it happen except in circumstances where they feel confident of victory. The United Nations observers in the desert have taken on a thankless task.</p>

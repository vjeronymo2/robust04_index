			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'INTELLECTUALS: MUTE VOICE'  </P> <P> Davis' column skipped over an important point. There are thousands of voices  speaking out at any moment about the problems facing America, but once an  individual states the need for sweeping change he is likely to be denied access  to the media. Intellectuals such as Noam Chomsky or Gore Vidal may get mention  as personalities, but to get access to their ideas one has to know their names  and look for them in a bookstore. There has been a campaign for the last  several months to get a progressive counterpart to William Buckley et al on  PBS, but with no results I've ever seen.  </P> <P> Individuals such as Edward Abbey, Abbie Hoffman, or I.F. Stone have to die or  be arrested to get into the mainstream media. Perhaps if they had been given an  open hearing for their ideas, the former two would not have had to engage in or  advocate outrageous behavior to give us a faint hope for change. Then we could  have thought they were intellectuals too. I'm afraid even to mention the host  of New Age thinkers because they've all been branded as weird and flaky.  </P> <P> As recommended reading, Riane Eisler, Michael Parenti and Robert Anton Wilson  all suggest interesting reasons why the public does not get exposed to ideas  that shake up the system. Their books may be available in one of the few  remaining independent bookstores.  </P> <P> TOM PLISKA  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

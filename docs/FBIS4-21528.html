			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ciampi Opens Meeting of Environment </F> Ministers"]    [Excerpts] Florence, 12 Mar (ANSA) -- The environment  ministers from the Group of Seven industrialized nations,  meeting here today and tomorrow for informal talks to prepare  for the G-7 summit in Naples in July, are now given the  opportunity to "jointly reflect on the relationships between the  environment, technological progress and economic development,"  said Premier Carlo Azeglio Ciampi of Italy.    Opening the assembly in historic Palazzo Pitti, the  government leader pointedly asked, "If the developing countries  were to reach the same rate of consumption as our own in an  uncontrolled way, how many more planets other than the earth  would we need?"    The Italian [environment] minister, Valdo Spini, reminded  his  colleagues that, "One of the G-7 priorities should be that of  launching a vast program of technological partnership to  facilitate access to appropriate standards of high technology  for the protection of the global environment.    "More in general, if we do not want developing nations to  industrialize according to polluting models of the past, we  cannot preach to them. We must, rather, help them introduce new  clean technologies," said Spini.    Discussing the search for new instruments for financing  sustainable development, the minister said, "Our economies will  benefit from a partial shift in the distribution of taxes away  from economic assets, such as work and capital, and towards the  so-called environmentally-harmful, such as wastes, emissions and  non-renewal resources.    "Eco-taxes can provide funds for the reduction of the public  deficit and public-sector spending requirements at a cost lower  than conventional rates," said the minister. Pursuing the same  theme, Spini said, "Thanks to the fiscal lever, it will be  possible to finance indispensable environment protection  programs which involve job creation. The white paper approved  by the European Union last December," he continued, "clarifies  how an ambitious environment policy, as [European Commission  President] Jacques Delors says, can create hundreds of thousands  of jobs."    Concluding his remarks, the minister noted that the links  between new jobs and eco-taxes will come up for further  discussion in Detroit where the G-7 labor ministers begin  meeting Monday [14 March]. [passage omitted]    Later in the day, Ciampi noted, "There are no simple  solutions for complex problems. What is required is a  systematic, open and innovative approach, with coordinated  answers, more valid than the sum of the single answers."    In his statement to the ministers, the premier focused on  the  problem of financial resources and the aggravation of this  problem by the present recession. In this connection he cited  the need for a further search for "original solutions, based not  so much on greater budget allocations as on the careful  management of what we have available, on suiting our conduct to  new development requirements, on a commitment to appropriate  fiscal and credit incentive instruments, on further recourse to  measures for energy saving and the development of renewable  resources." Thus, he added, it will be necessary to "rule  technological progress and not be ruled by it."    According to Ciampi, the "essence of sustainable development  is, in fact, in a commitment to harmonize solid and lasting  economic growth through the rational utilization of materials  and economically-scarce energy resources, along with the need to  avoid interventions by man which have negative impact on the  local and global environment."    After noting the growing role played by environmental issues  in the work of the annual G-7 summits, the premier recalled that  the Rio de Janeiro Earth Conference "highlighted in an  unequivocal way the unavoidable link between safeguarding the  environment, productive processes and technologies." This is a  matter of, on the one hand, "preventing pollution, climatic  changes, the alteration of great natural spaces and, on the  other, work for governing and quickly directing complex  phenomena linked to populations and their habits, such as those  related to disorderly demographic growth."</p>

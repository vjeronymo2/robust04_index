			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FULLERTON STARTS QUICKLY, WINS BIG  </P> <P> Fullerton High School returned the opening kickoff 86 yards for a touchdown and  rolled to a 37-7 rout of Sonora Friday night in front of 2,100 fans in  Fullerton District Stadium.  </P> <P> David Chacon raced untouched to the end zone on the first play of the game and  Fullerton opened with 21 points in the first quarter -- its biggest offensive  outburst of the season -- in the Freeway League opener for both schools.  </P> <P> Fullerton (5-1, 1-0) already had scored 21 points with 3:44 remaining in the  first quarter despite totaling only 42 yards. Fullerton, which scored only  three points in a loss to Western last week, had plenty of offense, but the  outcome didn't please Coach Steve Nishimoto.  </P> <P> "I'm not happy," said Nishimoto. "We won by 30 points, but we were sloppy. The  touchdown on the opening kickoff really got us off to a good start, but all  those penalties hurt."  </P> <P> Fullerton was penalized 12 times for 125 yards, most of the infractions coming  on holding calls or late hits. The erratic play came only a week after  Fullerton lost five fumbles in a 9-3 loss to Western.  </P> <P> "We can't continue to play like this against good teams and win," Nishimoto  said. "I'm concerned about some bad habits we've fallen into."  </P> <P> Fortunately, Sonora (2-4, 0-1) wasn't much opposition, despite fielding what  many think is its best football team in the 1980s. Quarterback Ryan Lewis  fumbled twice and was intercepted once as Sonora mounted only one scoring  drive.  </P> <P> Lewis completed only four of 17 pass attempts as Fullerton's defense, led by  junior linebacker D.C. Olsen, continually pressured him. Fullback Scott Tibbets  scored Sonora's only touchdown on a 40-yard run.  </P> <P> Fullerton's reluctant receiver, John Bailey, had quite a night. He caught  touchdown passes of 18 and 36 yards and had another touchdown play of 53 yards  nullified by a penalty. Bailey also kicked a 28-yard field goal, was successful  on four conversion kicks and was named the senior prince in homecoming  ceremonies at halftime.  </P> <P> Not bad for a guy who once quit the team. Bailey had decided to concentrate on  baseball in his senior year, but changed his mind and joined the team four  weeks ago. He has caught 18 passes for 278 yards in only four games since.  </P></p>

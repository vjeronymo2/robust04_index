			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Russian miners to demand price cuts RUSSIA'S economic reform programme came under severe pressure yesterday as militant miners said they would demand lower prices and parliament sought to regain some control over the government. Meanwhile, government officials and advisers accused the Russian Central Bank of sabotaging the reforms. Leaders of the Kuzbass miners, who have gone on strike twice in the past four years, are to meet the Russian president and government ministers today or tomorrow to demand lower prices - with some of them predicting strike action if the talks fail. The government is already changing some policies as it becomes evident that they are not working. Moscow Radio announced that Russia was auctioning licences allowing the export of Dollars 90m (Pounds 50.2m) of oil and other resources - with the money going to the import of badly needed foodstuffs. Officials said later that the system of licence auctioning would probably replace the requirement on exporters to change hard currency earned at half of the market rate - a system which has been heavily criticised and widely evaded. Also, the new value added tax of 28 per cent is likely to be cut or even abolished in the face of spiralling prices. This follows comments by Mr Nikolai Ryabov, chairman of the Council of the Republic, one of the two houses of the Russian parliament. He said at the weekend that parliament would propose that the tax be 'reconsidered' because monopolistic state enterprises had caused prices to 'rise very steeply, not four to five times as was predicted but eight, 10 or more times. It is clear that this is a prelude to a monopolistic price rise rather than a prelude to the market'. The government lays much of the blame on a huge credit expansion undertaken last year by the Russian Central Bank whose chairman, Mr Georgy Matiukhin, they accuse of irresponsibility. Officials say Rbs600bn of credits were advanced last year, at an annual 6 per cent rate of interest during a period of accelerating inflation. Ministers see the availability of virtually no-cost credit as the largest threat to their programme. The credit allows enterprises to push up product prices and wait for buyers, with little incentive to increase output. The parliamentary praesidium yesterday considered draft legislation which would win back the right of parliament to approve the composition of the government - a right given away last year when Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, demanded emergency powers. Mr Yeltsin has accepted an invitation to visit Britain and is expected to make the trip in the near future. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, extended the invitation for a full-scale visit during more than two hours of talks in Moscow with the Russian leader.

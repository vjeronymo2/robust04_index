			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Spain - Banking, Finance and Investment (7): Having second thoughts / Causes celebres, Suzuki Anti-Japanese graffiti on the walls of the southern Spanish town of Linares bears witness to one of the bitterest stories of foreign investment in Spain over the past decade. 'On terms like these, we want no Japanese,' reads one of the milder slogans outside the factory gate of Santana Motor, subsidiary of Suzuki. The embattled car company has provided the most dramatic example of a multinational venture having second thoughts about its investment in Spain. The case is all the more telling because Suzuki's arrival on the scene is relatively recent. Like Nissan, which also has problems at its Motor Iberica subsidiary in Barcelona, it began producing in Spain shortly before the country's accession to the European Union, with a view to creating a competitive export base. By suspending payments to creditors in February and proposing drastic job cuts, Santana's Japanese management provoked an explosive reaction in the Linares region, which is heavily dependent on the factory and its 30-odd supplier companies. Demonstrators mobbed the Japanese embassy in Madrid promising 'dynamite next time'. The Spanish government, seriously concerned that other Japanese investors would take fright, launched a propaganda campaign in Tokyo to try to limit the damage. Many of the 40 or 50 Japanese executives and technicians at Santana are thought to have moved to the capital or to have left the country. Amid general confusion in the industry about the company's intentions, the management has repeatedly declined requests for interviews. Three months after the suspension of payments the Socialist regional government persuaded a reluctant Suzuki to back a milder cutback plan, involving 900 instead of the 2,400 exmployees instead of the 1,500 originally proposed by the company, with the promise of a credit package. The plan is an effort to buy time while a desperate search goes on for a new owner. The regional authorites are understood to have trawled the world's motor companies for interest. Only two - BMW-Rover, which has a historical link with Santana, and Hyundai of South Korea - are thought to have shown any willingness even to look into it. In its origins, Santana is typical of industrial ventures set up in the Franco period to gain access to a protected market. Starting in the mid-1950s, it made parts for farm machinery, gearboxes for 2CV Citroen cars, and then Land Rovers under licence, selling to the Spanish and Latin American markets, with the UK company as a shareholder. But in the early 1980s Land Rover excluded the Spanish plant from its plans for new models. From 1984 the factory began making Suzuki four-wheel-drive runabouts as well, and in 1990 Land Rover sold its last shareholding, leaving the Japanese company in effective control. However, Suzuki's commitment was also lukewarm. Its current 84 per cent stake came by default, because other shareholders would not subscribe to much-needed new capital. 'There has been no big investment in technology, either by the British or the Japanese,' says Antonio Fernandez Siles, chairman of the works council, recognising the difficulty of competing with other manufacturing sites. Suzuki figures show labour costs at Linares accounting for almost 20 per cent of sales compared with 7 per cent in Japan. In the past three years the Spanish subsidiary showed losses of Pta21bn and during this year's conflict it is reckoned to have been losing money at a rate of Pta30m a day. The irony is that Santana has become more of a household name in Spain the past four months, because of the protest movement against job losses, than it ever was because of the vehicles produced at the factory.</p>

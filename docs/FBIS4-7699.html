			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Police Patrol Seized"] </F>   [Text] On 30 March 1994, around 1100, in the vicinity of  the spot called Mecka near Kumanovo, three members of the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's army abducted a three-member  police patrol at the police station in Zeglane, reports the  Ministry of Internal Affairs. The police patrol was on its  regular duty when in the vicinity of Mecka they were surrounded  by three members of the FRY army. The latter pointed their guns  at the policemen and told them to leave the vehicle and to  surrender. Their weapons were then taken and the patrol,  together with their vehicle, were brought to the Prohor Pcinski  border army station on Yugoslav territory. Somewhere around 2230  on the same day, the patrol were set free and, together with the  complete equipment, their arms and the vehicle, were delivered  to the Macedonian border authorities. The incident took place  on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 350-400 meters off the  border line. The Foreign Ministry of the Republic of Macedonia  delivered a protest note to the Foreign Ministry of the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia, expressing deep concern considering the  fact that such incidents do not contribute to the establishment  of regular friendly relations between the two neighboring  countries.</p>

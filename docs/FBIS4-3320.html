			<p>BFN     [Text] Maputo, April 15 (XINHUA) -- China and Mozambique  agreed here today that China will continue sending medical teams  to Mozambique.    A protocal on this issue was signed by Chinese Ambassador to  Mozambique Mi Shiheng and Mozambican Deputy Health Minister  Maria Campos on behalf of their respective government.    Campos said after the signing ceremony that China has been  sending medical teams to Mozambique since the Southern African  country declared independence in 1975.    The Chinese medical teams have played an active role in the  development of the Mozambican health sector, he said.    There are now eight Chinese medical teams in Mozambique.  Under the new protocal, a ninth 11-member medical team will  arrive in Mozambique this year.</p>

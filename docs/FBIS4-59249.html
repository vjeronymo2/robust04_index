			<p>BFN     [Text] Palestinian sources in Tunis have said that Israel  has agreed to allow 1,000 PLO personnel from Tunisia into the  Gaza Strip and the Jericho area; however, Israel has not set a  date for this yet.    In a separate development, security sources told our  correspondent Yoni Ben-Menahem that the security authorities  have given permission to the preemptive security force, led by  Colonel Jibril al-Rujub, to enter Jericho on 17 May. The  vanguard of this force, comprising 20 persons, has been  permitted to bring in light arms. This force is to make  preparations for Yasir 'Arafat's imminent arrival in Jericho.</p>

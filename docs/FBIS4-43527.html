			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Against Contempt for Democracy"] </F>   [Text] The motto of the meeting of the Social Democratic  Party of Austria [SPOe] Federal Council in Vienna, "There is  much at stake, Austria is at stake," is no coincidence. One  week after the referendum on European Union membership, the SPOe  wants to use the impetus of the European elections for the  forthcoming Nationalrat election campaign. In his speech which  lasted almost one hour, SPOe Chairman Vranitzky yesterday  reminded the 300 delegates that the issue "on 9 October" is  "approval for a course of economic prosperity and social  security." And addressing Haider: "The SPOe intends to turn  its election movement into a large-scale campaign against the  new edition of contempt for democracy."    The SPOe chairman did not leave any doubt that he wants to  continue bearing the coalition partner in the government. With  the unanimous adoption of the electoral program (150,000  additional jobs) and the list of candidates, the course was set  to bring this about. Vranitzky himself is the top candidate on  the federal list and also on the Vienna [provincial] ticket.  The SPOe top candidate in Burgenland is Health Minister  Krammer, in Carinthia Deputy Anton Leikam, in Lower Austria  Social Affairs Minister Hesoun, in Upper Austria SPOe Economic  Spokesman Nowotny, in Salzburg SPOe Deputy Harald Hofmann, in  Styria Heidrun Silhavy, in Tirol Walter Guggenberger, in  Vorarlberg SPOe Federal Councilor Herbert Boesch. Banker Rene  Alfons Haider is also running for the Nationalrat: on the  promising 25th place of the SPOe's federal ticket.</p>

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Kozyrev warns Armenia over aid Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, yesterday threatened Armenia with 'something other than persuasion' if it did not curtail its support for the Armenian-dominated enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan. It had reached a limit, he said 'beyond which ..lies direct harm to Russia's national and state interests'. This is the first time a senior Russian politician has directly threatened retaliation against Armenia for its sponsorship of the Karabakh independence movement, a sponsorship the republic has always denied. It comes after an incident at the weekend when Mr Vladimir Kazimirov, Russia's mediator in the Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict, came under fire and two Azeri escorts were injured. At a hastily-summoned news conference, Mr Kozyrev demanded a public apology for the incident from Mr Levan Ter-Petrosyan, Armenia's president, along with the punishment of those responsible. He threatened an end to Russian aid if the apology were not forthcoming. Armenia is heavily dependent on Russian assistance, especially over fuel. Mr Kozyrev said his concern was motivated by the recent advance of the Armenian forces far beyond the enclave's borders to take wide swathes of Azeri territory, causing floods of refugees. The conflict threatens to involve both Turkey and Iran on the side of Azerbaijan. The stage seems set for pressure on Armenia to take part in talks to end the conflict.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed interview with two unidentified officials of </F> the National Security Office; place and date not given: "Who  Sent the Terrorists to Parliament?"]    [Text] The police and the National Security Office [NSO]  are working with their entire apparatus to investigate the  bombing at the Parliament building. The two organizations are  cooperating closely. We interviewed two high-ranking officials  of the National Security Office, who do not wish their names to  be revealed. They asked for our understanding because, in the  course of investigating such affairs, there are always moments  that cannot be made public. We first asked them to deal with  the speculation here and abroad.    [NEPSZABADSAG] Is it possible that an international  terrorist organization is behind this bombing at the parliament?    [Official] Like other versions, this is not impossible.  However, these organizations generally declare themselves after  the event or immediately beforehand. In other words, they  "claim responsibility." No such signal has arrived in this case.    [NEPSZABADSAG] Do you consider it possible that a domestic  extremist organization is behind it?    [Official] One cannot exclude this possibility, but there is  no tradition of such a thing in Hungary. The fact that  Parliament is also the symbol of our national past and history  speaks against this possibility. Most known extremist  organizations we can think of in this respect stress their  national roots, and this does not seem to be compatible with an  action against this historical site of our statehood.    [NEPSZABADSAG] There are autonomous forces operating beyond  our southern borders, forces that are not under state control.  Threats against Hungarians in Vojvodina have also been mentioned  in the press. There are rumors about the possibility of such  organizations extending their operations beyond their own  borders. Could all this be connected with the explosion?    [Official] I do not know your sources of information.  Consequently, I do not want to comment at all on what you have  just said. I repeat: We will investigate every possibility.  We will not leave out any possibility.    [NEPSZABADSAG] Including the possibility that this action  could somehow be connected with Magda Marinko's affair?    [Official] I am sorry that I have to repeat: We will not  leave out any possibility. Not even such a possibility. Nor  the possibility that a "lone wolf" or a crazy man carried out  the bombing.    [NEPSZABADSAG] You saw the location. What would you add to  the descriptions that appeared in the press?    [Official] The fact that the front of Gate No. 19 was  protected by a fence; at the same time, this is a building area.  The attacker had to get over the fence, but this was probably  not difficult because there were holes in the fence. A man of  average physical condition could reach the gate from the Danube,  place the bomb, and disappear in 3-4 minutes. If we take into  account the approximately 6 minutes between two appearances of  the guard in this area, the bomber had enough time.    [NEPSZABADSAG] In other words, a single person could have  done it.    [Unnamed official] It is not impossible. It is another  matter that, in such cases, there is preliminary surveillance of  the guards' movements and the placement of the television  cameras, and there could be accomplices to choose the location  and provide accommodation. However, with exact knowledge of the  specifics of the location, a single person and 3-4 minutes would  be enough.    [NEPSZABADSAG] Is the bomb found at Parliament a "relative"  of the one in Szeged?    [Official] Yes, but I would entrust my colleagues with the  details.    [NEPSZABADSAG] You have been on location since early  morning. What did you do?    [Official] We cooperated closely with the police bomb  disposal experts. We collected everything that remained from  the explosive device. Everything goes to the lab. It is  tedious work, but it is worth it. The location and what remains  there tell a lot even about the most sophisticated bomb.    [NEPSZABADSAG] What did you find?    [Official] We found many pieces of a green-colored plastic,  presumably pieces of a soap-holder-type box which held the  alarm-watch-type timing device. There must have been somewhat  less than one kilogram of TNT in the bomb.    [NEPSZABADSAG] Is this a lot or little? What if this amount  explodes on or in a car for example?    [Official] It is a strong bomb that would kill all the  passengers and destroy the car completely.    [NEPSZABADSAG] How big could this bomb be?    [Official] Altogether not bigger than 20x15 cm. It could  comfortably be placed in a shopping bag.    [NEPSZABADSAG] In what range can the timing device be set?  Could you reconstruct the bomb?    [Official] The explosion can be set from 15 minutes to 26  hours. Theoretically, it can also be set for a shorter time  than 15 minutes, but if the time span is too short, it could  also endanger the terrorist himself. Of course, we cannot say  when the device was set before the explosion. Not only can we  reconstruct the bomb but, thanks to what the bomb disposal  experts have collected, we can see the exact model. Everything  on this model is identical with this bomb before it went off.    [NEPSZABADSAG] In connection with the bomb in Szeged, your  colleague said only that it was a "relative" of the bomb that  exploded at the Parliament.    [Official] If I may use the term here, I would say it was  its little brother. We tested its power by analyzing the  deformations on the pillar. The result: We are talking here  about the same device, the same mechanical timing device, the  same bomb, only with half the amount of explosive material.    [NEPSZABADSAG] In other words, it could be the same  perpetrator. Is it possible that he is preparing for a third  attack?    [Official] We cannot answer this question. Together with  our police colleagues, we are working to discover and arrest the  perpetrator or perpetrators....</p>

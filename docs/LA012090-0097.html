			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YUGOSLAVIA, FINDING ITSELF LAGGING, EYES CHANGES;  </P> <P> EAST EUROPE: WITH THE ECONOMY A SHAMBLES AND UNREST GROWING, THE COMMUNISTS ARE  MEETING THIS WEEKEND TO CURB THEIR POWER, TRY OTHER REFORMS.  </P> <P> For decades, Yugoslavia was the pacesetter in political and economic reforms in  Eastern Europe: It was the first Communist country to allow its citizens to  travel freely abroad, and it had less of the looming police state that darkened  most of the region.  </P> <P> Yugoslavians liked to say they were on "the sunny side of the Alps." Their  country was independent, innovative and, after it broke from the Soviet Bloc in  1948, mostly free from the shackles of Stalinism.  </P> <P> In almost every way, from the wealth of goods in its shop windows to the hordes  of topless Western European tourists on its Adriatic beaches, Yugoslavia felt  better off than its Communist kin.  </P> <P> But that was before the amazing year of change in 1989. Today the relatively  progressive country founded by Marshal Josip Broz Tito, the late Communist  rebel who died 10 years ago this spring, finds itself suddenly lagging far  behind its neighbors in many areas.  </P> <P> "What we took 40 years to accomplish, they did in one month in Czechoslovakia,"  marveled Slavko Splichal, a sociologist from Ljubljana, in the northwest corner  of Yugoslavia.  </P> <P> "The Yugoslavs look around and see that Albania is the only country left that  is not moving," a Western diplomat here said. "Believe me, they do not like to  be compared to Albania."  </P> <P> In an attempt to catch up with the rest of Eastern Europe, the Yugoslav  Communist Party is expected to relinquish its monopolistic hold on power and  endorse other reforms at a special meeting here this weekend. But the congress  of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia comes at a time when the country  finds itself confronted with a panoply of very difficult challenges.  </P> <P> Yugoslavia's economy is in shambles, with an effective inflation rate topping  2,000% last year. The foreign debt is more than $20 billion.  </P> <P> Until the federal government finally made the Yugoslav dinar convertible into  hard currency in December -- the first Eastern European country to take this  important step -- daily life here often involved hours of complicated dealings  with black-market money traders.  </P> <P> Even more troubling, the nasty Balkan conflicts that gave the country its  reputation as the "tinderbox of Europe" have resurfaced in a big way, spreading  talk of secession and a breakup of the Yugoslav federation along the lines of  the old Austro-Hungarian empire.  </P> <P> In the most celebrated recent example of the internal feuding, the government  of Serbia, the largest of the six republics in Yugoslavia, ordered an economic  boycott of Slovenia, the richest Yugoslav republic.  </P> <P> Populist Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic called the boycott after the  Slovenian government blocked a pro-Serbian demonstration he planned in  Ljubljana, the Slovenian capital, on Dec. 1. Since then, some Serbian banks  have refused to transfer funds to their Slovene counterparts. Popular items  such as Slovenian mineral water and Coca-Cola, bottled in Slovenia, have  disappeared from markets as a result.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, at a political meeting of new opposition parties in Ljubljana on  Wednesday, speaker after speaker urged greater autonomy, even independence, for  Slovenia. The guests of honor at the rally were politicians from Austria and  Italy, countries many Slovenes say they prefer to their own.  </P> <P> For years, Yugoslavia has always been an improbable country. With six  republics, two provinces, four languages, three religions and two alphabets, it  defies most definitions of statehood. United as partisan fighters against the  Germans during World War II, the Yugoslavs were kept together for 35 years  under the leadership of Tito.  </P> <P> But even Tito had to intervene with force to quell an ethnic-nationalist  uprising in Croatia in the early 1970s.  </P> <P> After Tito's death in 1980, no other pan-Yugoslavian leader has emerged.  Economic disparities between the republics -- Slovenia has a per-capita income  three times higher than Serbia, for example -- has fostered jealousies.  </P> <P> The traditional Communist Party leadership was hopelessly identified with  failed economic schemes, a classic example of which was a nickel-alloy  production facility in Macedonia. Built at a cost of $2 billion, the plant was  never used because of a collapse in the world nickel market and because assays  showed the nickel ore in the region, one of Yugoslavia's poorest, was not  nearly rich enough to exploit profitably.  </P> <P> In the place of the old Tito-style politicians, mostly Communists who favored a  strong federal government, new regionally based leaders such as Milosevic have  surfaced. Milosevic has won broad appeal by championing the plight of Serbian  minorities in other republics and provinces.  </P> <P> Although there are 8 million Serbs in Yugoslavia, the largest ethnic group  among the country's 25.5 million citizens, only 60% live in the republic of  Serbia, with the rest scattered as minorities in other states.  </P> <P> Rekindling an age-old flame for "a greater Serbian state," Milosevic used his  power as Serbian Communist Party leader to subjugate Kosovo and Vojvodina, the  two so-called autonomous provinces inside Serbia, because of what he claimed  was persecution of Serbs there.  </P> <P> In Kosovo, where a majority of the population is Albanian, Milosevic ordered  the arrest and prosecution of Albanian Communist Azem Vlasi, a move that has  been widely criticized on human rights grounds in the West.  </P> <P> Milosevic's Kosovo moves also frightened people in other republics where fears  of Serbian dominance have existed for centuries. "The old maxim is that a  strong Serbia means a weak Yugoslavia," one diplomat here said.  </P> <P> Although he relinquished his job as head of the Serbian Communist Party when he  was elected as president of the Serbian republic this fall, Milosevic is  expected to be a key player behind the scenes when the four-day party congress  opens today.  </P> <P> The crucial issues to be debated at the party congress are the constitutionally  ordained leadership role of the party; multi-party elections, and a proposal by  Slovene Communists for a "League of Communist Leagues" in which each republic  would have an equal vote instead of the population-based voting that now favors  Serbia.  </P> <P> According to most sources, the first two points already have been approved by  the Communist leadership. At a news conference Friday, Yugoslavian Deputy Prime  Minister Vivko Pregl preempted the party congress by announcing an eight-point  proposal for reform, including an end to the party's domination of labor  unions.  </P> <P> "Our intention is to change the leading role of the Communist Party," Pregl  said. "We want to write in as much freedom as possible with regard to political  affiliation."  </P></p>

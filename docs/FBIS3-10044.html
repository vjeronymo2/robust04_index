			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Arquimedes Gonzalez] </F>   [Text] On the third day of the hearing on the homicide of  Jean Paul Genie, which occurred in October 1990, military  prosecutor Lester Gallo Sandoval on 23 February ordered the  provisional arrest of two more bodyguards of General Humberto  Ortega, chief of the Sandinist People's Army, EPS. This makes a  total of six bodyguards who have been interrogated and placed  under provisional arrest.    Bodyguards Jose Marino Medina Alvarez and Arnoldo Enrique  Morales Montes were interrogated on the morning of 23 February,  after which they were notified of their provisional arrests and  then transferred to La Granja on km 14 of the road to Masaya.    Coinciding with previous depositions given by four  bodyguards, both Medina and Morales said that on 28 October 1990  at approximately 1400 they left Las Colinas in a Renegado jeep  and two white Toyota Cressidas and went to the General Command,  returning to Military Complex 003 located at Gen. Ortega's  residence at approximately 1800.  <H5>  Nothing Abnormal on the Day of the Incident </H5>   Marino Medina said the EPS chief's caravan uses a silver  Renegado jeep and that the day of the incident everything was  normal when they left: "There was nothing abnormal." In  answering a question from the prosecutor, Medina said that the  bodyguards "only fire if they are attacked first. We have never  fired at a suspect," he stressed.    Meanwhile, Morales Montes did not provide any new  information  and only reiterated what the other five bodyguards who were  interrogated before him had said.    Mario Barahona Portocarrero, the defense lawyer for four of  the bodyguards, said on 23 February that the arrest warrant  issued for the bodyguards contained "serious flaws." For  instance, "we have not yet seen a witness who can identify them  or truly prove their participation in the action."    Prosecutor Daniel Olivas, however, claims he has "the  necessary evidence" to prove the bodyguards are guilty. "The  empty cartridges belong to their rifles, and there was a Bengal  light which is only used by them," he stressed. Olivas said that  the bodyguards' weapons were not confiscated immediately after  the crime but several days later, and "now the rifles have  disappeared," which could mean that they were intentionally  hidden.    In that regard, Barahona said that investigations  "established that the empty cartridges were from AK rifles, but  the report never said that the shots were fired by Gen. Ortega's  bodyguards."  <H5>  The Rifles Were Not Fired </H5>   "The rifles were never fired," Barahona said, adding that  "the forensic experts did not find traces of gunpowder in the  bodyguard's rifles." Barahona gave little importance to the  investigation conducted by a Venezuelan mission in 1990,  "because from the beginning they started accusing Gen. Ortega's  bodyguards without considering other possibilities. They did  not come here to investigate but to accuse," he noted.    Military Prosecutor Lester Gallo Sandoval said that no  further actions have been scheduled since the two bodyguards'  depositions because no requests have been received from the  plaintiff's side. He added that it is possible that the case  could be resolved in the next 10 days, when he should have  enough material to reach the necessary conclusions. He added  that he will summon all the witnesses in order to have more  evidence to work with when passing judgment.    At the end of the hearing Raymond Genie insisted on  disqualifying the military court and the Supreme Court of  Justice's decision to transfer the case to that court. In a  document presented at noon on 23 February, Genie referred to the  sentence issued on 31 January 1993 by Judge Boanerges Ojeda  ordering the "provisional arrest of the soldier or soldiers  implicated in the case" and in which Gen. Ortega and Captains  Jose Orozco Pavon and Lorenzo Martin Romero Betanco were  mentioned as "concealers." Based on that sentence Genie  requested that provisional arrest warrants be issued for the  presumed "concealers" Judge Ojeda mentioned in his sentence.</p>

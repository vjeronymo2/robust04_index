			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE CONSTRUCTION EXPECTED TO DECLINE FROM 1988 ACTIVITY  </P> <P> Construction in the state was up in 1988 but will be down this year, according  to the Construction Industry Research Board.  </P> <P> In 1988, construction totaled $44.88 billion, up 11.6% from 1987, adjusted for  inflation. The 1989 forecast is for a decline of 12.5%, to $39.26 billion.  </P> <P> The board said the 1988 increase was due, in part, to several large projects in  the nonresidential and heavy construction sectors and high housing permit  activity in areas where growth-control measures appeared on election ballots.  </P> <P> The predicted decline in 1989 is seen as an adjustment following "unusually  high" 1988 activity and as a reflection of anticipated increases in interest  rates. Additionally, sewer capacity shortages in the Los Angeles area will  restrict building.  </P> <P> Construction employment averaged 607,000 in 1988, up 5.6% from 1987. A 0.5% is  foreseen for 1989, mainly because of the time lag between building permit  issuance, or contract award.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Guido Boodts: "Impossible Major"] </F>   [Text] The impossibility of finding a successor to European  Commission (EC) President Jacques Delors at the Corfu summit has  inflicted deep wounds upon Europe. The British veto against  Jean-Luc Dehaene probably hurts the Belgian prime minister less  than anyone.    The whole affair caused acerbic reactions in the Netherlands  where they threaten to have an impact on public opinion  regarding the whole question of European unification, enthusiasm  for which has already cooled in recent years, as evident in the  low turnout for the European elections.    Dehaene cannot withdraw after 11 countries, some more  spontaneously than others, have supported his candidacy. Major,  on the other hand, has committed himself so strongly that it is  impossible for him to agree to the appointment of Dehaene  without loss of face.    The question as to who will or will not be considered as  Delors' successor will now be the subject of a great deal of  string pulling, especially behind the scenes. We have seen how  these things work. In the meantime, we cannot avoid drawing a  number of conclusions.    Prime Minister Major is seeing a constant crumbling of his  own authority and of his parliamentary majority. His leadership  of the Conservative Party is being openly questioned. Since  Maastricht, it has become increasingly clear that he is the  prisoner of a relatively small, but vociferous and determined  group of Euroskeptics who are constantly threatening to bring  him down. This group's hold is becoming stronger as Major's  position becomes weaker. The worst of it is that the group is  gradually getting the whole of Europe in its grip by hindering  the decisionmaking process.    London could more or less correctly claim that France and  Germany sought to impose their candidate on the other European  Union (EU) countries. But how can one defend the fact that one  country can oppose the will of 11 other countries? Not just  once, in the Dehaene affair, but on countless occasions. The  position is in fact that British interests, or rather the  interests of the British prime minister and his government,  weigh heavier than those of the whole of Europe.    In such a situation, Major should have the courage to give  up  EU full membership, as France did under De Gaulle in the case of  NATO membership when it failed to correspond to the basic  philosophy of the alliance. With the opt-outs in the Maastricht  Treaty, he has in fact already gone down this road without  admitting so in public. He would do better to formalize the  British position. If he does not do so, the other EU countries  must demand that he does.    German Chancellor Kohl will be faced with a difficult issue  right from the start of his European presidency on 1 July. In a  year which will decide his political future at the parliamentary  elections in the spring, Kohl has to find a way out which cannot  be interpreted as a sign of his own weakness or a victory by  British Prime Minister Major.    Kohl is rightly aiming at a solution before the first  meeting  of the recently elected European Parliament (EP) on 19 July. The  EP would certainly feel the failure of the government leaders to  elect the EC president as an attack on one of its most recently  acquired major competences, namely the granting of confidence in  the EC. It would threaten the essential good working  relationship between the political EU institutions right from  the outset.    The idea for the European Commissioner to be elected by the  EP if necessary then becomes more attractive. Such a proposal  was already circulating at the time of the Maastricht  negotiations. Under the present "constitutional" relationships  in the Union, this is impossible. But it should be a subject  for the intergovernmental conference on the review of Maastricht  in 1996.</p>

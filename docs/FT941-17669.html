			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Euro Disney hit Euro Disney, engulfed by financial problems and badly mauled earlier in the week by worries about its survival, took another hammering, ending another painful session a further 28 off at 350p. In an interview with a French magazine, Le Point, Mr Michael Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney, Euro Disney's US parent, said closure of the Euro Disney theme park was one possible outcome of talks between Euro Disney and its bankers. UK holiday companies, however, performed well, with Rank Organisation 7 1/2 firmer at 985 1/2 p. The tour operators were rock steady, Airtours holding firm at 492p after good gains earlier in the week. Bookings for winter and summer holidays are strongly ahead. Mr Roy Owens, leisure analyst at Smith New Court said 'Bookings are very strong and margins reasonable; it's all shaping up to be another very good summer season for the holiday companies, particularly Airtours. Banks heavily involved in the Pacific Rim area continued to outpace their UK counterparts, responding to another session of big gains on the Hong Kong market which hit yet another record yesterday. HSBC powered ahead to close 16 up at a peak 974p; over the year the shares have almost doubled, rising from the 492p level. During the same period Standard Chartered have performed even better with the shares, up 8 yesterday at 1242p, having risen from 573p. Royal Bank of Scotland, the best performer of the UK banks this year, eased 4 to 494p. Kleinwort Benson's elevation to the top of the mergers and acquisitions league in 1993 kept the shares steady at 583p. Discount houses, always boosted by reductions in interest rates, came in for good support with Cater Allen 9 firmer at 608p and Gerrard &amp; National 8 up at 468p. BT relinquished an early modest gain and slipped back to close 2 1/2 off at 472 1/2 p on good turnover of 2.9m shares after news that its US associate, MCI, in which BT is buying a 20 per cent stake, is moving into the US local telephone market. Vodafone, the UK's leading cellular phones company, continued to attract considerable local and overseas support triggered by recent booming sales and new connections, ending the session 3 higher at 594p. A flurry of profit-taking affected Cable &amp; Wireless, which, after moving higher at the outset in response to strong gains on the Hong Kong market, came off sharply to close 8 down at 522p. Internationally traded stocks were weaker on balance following a soggy New York market. Conglomerate Hanson fell 3 to 268 1/2 p while Reuters Holdings continued to suffer from profit taking after its recent rally and closed 13 lower at 1787p. ICI consolidated after buying pressure on Thursday and eased 2 to 800p while Zeneca slipped a 1 1/2 to 840 1/2 p. BAT Industries was off 3 at 553 1/2 p with some speculation that its insurance arm Eagle Star lay behind the massive OTC options expiry which has been moving the London stock market recently. However, senior marketmakers said the UK's premier fund management group was the principal party. Bid speculation continued to swirl around Fisons, the troubled pharmaceuticals group and the shares rose 2 against the market to 134p. Fisons has been seen as a bid target for some two years and the rumours have intensified since the company sacked its chief executive and announced heavy redundancies recently. But one analyst dismissed the talk as 'hogwash'. A bright early showing by Asda, one of the big five food retailers, was halted by news that the group's retail director, Mr Peter Monaghan is leaving the company for 'personal and family reasons.' Mr Monaghan was said to have been unwell for some time. Asda rose to 58p during early trading but eased on the news to close a penny down on balance at 55 1/2 p. The other food retailing giants also gave ground. Kwik-Save, the best performer in the sector in recent days, dipped 6 to 618p while Sainsbury was 5 off at 444p and Tesco 1 1/2 cheaper at 213 1/2 p. Boots managed a minor gain, closing 2 ahead at 598p. A statement from the company on its Christmas trading performance is expected at the end of next week. Caradon was the pick of a generally firm building materials sector, the shares moving up 7 to 414p, amid hopes of further UK interest rate cuts. Shares in Flextech the unlisted cable and satellite television group, were suspended at 379p as the company announced it was buying the European programming assets of United Artists' European arm after issuing 52.36m shares worth Pounds 201.6m. British Aerospace improved 4 to 413p on the back of a recommendation by one leading UK securities house. Routine management changes at industrial materials groups Williams Holdings and Morgan Crucible were well received by the market. Williams rose 2 to 374p while Morgan hardened a penny to 365p. Healthcare Holdings shares were suspended at 1 3/4 p with the company announcing it was in negotiations with third parties 'which may lead to a significant corporate transaction' in early 1994.</p>

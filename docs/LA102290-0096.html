			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DONATIONS MIRROR SIZE OF COMMUNITY  </P> <P> So far, the campaign contributions received by City Council candidates have  matched the size of this bedroom community, with the largest single donation so  far reaching only $300, campaign documents show.  </P> <P> Loans from their own bank accounts have been the main source of revenue for the  11 candidates vying for three seats in the Nov. 6 election.  </P> <P> Incumbent Brian J. Rice, who topped the fund-raising list with $5,041, also  loaned his campaign the most money -- $4,000, according to the documents.  </P> <P> Joe Anderson, a former president of the city Chamber of Commerce, received the  most contributions, pulling in $3,896. About $3,297 of that total was in  contributions of less than $100.  </P> <P> Anderson has spent $2,912, the most of any of the candidates. He was followed  closely by incumbent Councilman Thomas Lorch, who spent $2,786, and Planning  Commissioner George Key, whose expenses totaled $2,671.  </P> <P> Lorch also received the largest single contribution -- $300 from W.J. Morison,  a county official.  </P> <P> Candidates Carol Hamilton, Scott Walker and Charles Seward filed short forms  indicating that they will not be raising or spending over $1,000 in their  campaigns.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE DAY AFTER -- AN EERIE LANDSCAPE OF DESTRUCTION;  </P> <P> TUNNEL: A FISSURE SMOKES LIKE A VOLCANIC VENT. A BUSWAY IS BLACKENED. THE  FREEWAY IS DESERTED.  </P> <P> Morning light brought into focus a stark scene of destruction Saturday along a  burned-out stretch of Metro Rail tunnel beneath the Hollywood Freeway.  </P> <P> The normally bustling highway stood deserted. On a typical weekday, 210,000  vehicles would pass this point within sight of Union Station, but this weekend  there was no traffic. Running parallel to the freeway, a blackened stretch of  the neighboring El Monte busway bore testament to the heat and smoke from the  fire that raged for the better part of a day.  </P> <P> Within feet of the eerily silent freeway, the earth had caved in. Where once  there was solid ground, now there was an elongated fissure, still smoking like  a volcanic vent. From the streets of the industrial district northeast of  downtown Los Angeles, one could look at the scene of the cave-in and see  twisted pipes, broken concrete, vast amounts of sand and hard-hatted engineers  surveying the damage.  </P> <P> Little more than a block away, near Ducommun and Center streets, the south  portal of the subway tunnel displayed the ravages of a fire that burned with  such heat that it twisted and distorted steel. A six-foot, fire-charred piece  of metal hung precariously above the mouth of the tunnel.  </P> <P> Thousands of wood timbers that once lined the interior of the subway tube were  reduced to ashes like kindling in a fireplace. Smoke still poured from an  opening above the tube. Firefighters stood by in the summer heat, allowing the  blaze to burn itself out.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, powerful pumps worked overtime in a pit where the tunnel ends,  sucking out pools of chocolate-brown water and mud that are tangible reminders  of the battle against the flames.  </P> <P> By contrast, a parallel tunnel with a full concrete lining was untouched.  </P> <P> As they peered into the opening below, firefighters recalled arriving on the  scene around 2 a.m. Friday to find the tunnel in flames. The heat was so  extreme, they said, water from their hoses was boiling on the street above.  </P> <P> On Saturday, they marveled at the damage and expressed relief that the intense  heat did not ignite the nearby storage tanks at Unocal's Center Street  Terminal.  </P> <P> As they spoke, the morning calm was broken by the groaning of a crane laboring  to remove parked cars, trucks and trailers whose weight put added burden on the  crippled tunnel below.  </P> <P> For blocks around, streets remained closed. At the scene, streams of yellow  police tape framed the destruction.  </P></p>

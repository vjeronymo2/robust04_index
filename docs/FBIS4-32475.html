			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman on Croatian Day </F> of Antifascists in Pazin, Istria--live relay]    [Text] Ladies and gentlemen; Croats; all citizens of  Pazin, Istria and all other Croatian areas; you who came here of  your own free will; and refugees who came because of their  misfortune. Today we mark an official holiday in Croatia, to  honor Croatian antifascism. This day has a special meaning for  all of Croatia, and particularly for Istria. On this day,  democratic and sovereign Croatia shows that the antifascist  struggle is one of its foundations. In this antifascist  struggle, in the difficult and crucial days of World War II,  Croatian patriots helped preserve the Croatian nation and create  a democratic, independent, and sovereign Croatian state.    This day was forgotten in former socialist Yugoslavia and in  socialist Croatia when it was part of Yugoslavia--in other  words, it was falsified. Instead of marking 22 June, when in  1941 Croatian antifascists began their struggle against fascism,  it was a struggle for a Croatian state and not for a Yugoslav  state. Instead, authorities of socialist Croatia proclaimed 27  July as the day of antifascist uprising, the day when Serbs from  Bosnia and Knin began fighting against the Independent State of  Croatia [NDH, Nezavisna Drzava Hrvatska]. The Serbs from Bosnia  and Croatia fought not because the NDH was linked with fascist  Italy and Germany but because it wanted to be Croatian. Serbs  and Chetniks from Knin were those who established links with  fascist Italy, and they would do the same today if they could.    Therefore, the current democratic and sovereign Croatia was  the one which set the matter straight as it will do with  everything else in Istria and the Croatian nation. [applause]    I happened to know, or shall I say, I was honored to know,  personally the man who on 22 June 1941 led 40 Croatian  communists from Sisak to the forest of Brezovica, thus starting  the antifascist struggle in Croatia. This struggle was against  fascism but also, as I said, for a free Croatia. It was Vlado  Janic, nicknamed Capo, a Croatian man, a Croatian worker, a  communist, but nonetheless a man who knew by heart the main  ideas of Antun Starcevic [19th century Croatian intellectual]  and the Radic brothers, Antun and Stjepan Radic [prewar  political leaders championing Croatian independence], a man who  [interupted by applause] fought that antifascist war in Croatia  with this idea of an all-Croat struggle. In Belgrade he was the  one who ordered the arrest of Punisa Racic, the man who murdered  the Croatian leader Stjepan Radic in the parliament in Belgrade,  and brought him to justice.    This is what is essential in Croatian antifascism, and this  is what we are accordingly going to pay deserved tribute to, as  an integral part of the Croatian people's struggle for freedom.  [applause] Viewed as a whole, this antifascist struggle by  Croatia was one of the greatest, not only within the confines of  the countries of the former Yugoslavia but in Europe, as well.  There is no truth in all those stories, which were meant to  fool both the Croatian and the international public, according  to which this partisan, national liberation struggle in Croatia  was a Serbian struggle alone. In the partisan antifascist  movement--in Croatia's partisan army--Croatians accounted for  over 60 percent. There were 28 percent of Serbs and all the  other nationalities, including Italians, Hungarians, and even  Germans and Ruthenians.    Hence, the armed force of Croatia's antifascist struggle was  Croatian. Understandably, a higher proportion of Serbs than  Croats took part in it because the Croats had been truly divided  in that period when battles of global proportions were being  waged between the antifascist coalition and the axis forces.  The leadership of the antifascist struggle in Croatia was in  Croatian hands. At the helm of this antifascist struggle in  Croatia was Andrija Hebrang, a Croatian communist but also a  Croatian patriot. There was also the Croatian poet Vladimir  Nazor, who worked here in Istria. It is here where he wrote his  beautiful poetry in the Istrian dialect.    After all, there is nothing accidental in the life of a  people or a movement. If we say that Croatian patriots, such as  those I have just mentioned, were at the forefront of Croatia's  antifascist struggle, then we should also mention that it was  also Croats who led the antifascist struggle across all of  Yugoslavia. Josip Broz Tito was a communist, but he was a  Croat, too. Ivan Ribar [Croatian communist killed during World  War II], was at the helm of the AVNOJ [Antifascist Council of  the People's Liberation of Yugoslavia]. He was a Croat, too.  [applause]    In that leadership of the antifascist struggle of both  Croatia and Yugoslavia, prominent positions were also held by  the representatives of Istria, representatives who favored the  Croatian character of Istria and who fought for the survival of  the Croatian identity in Istria and for having Istria as an  integral part of Croatia. [applause]    It seems that even you in Istria have forgotten that Ante  Mandic was also one of the most distinguished and well-known  people of this kind. During the First World War, he was the man  who advocated the unification of all Croatian lands and their  liberation from Italian occupation. He was on the Yugoslav  Council during the First World War. In the Second World War he  joined the antifascist struggle here in Opatija. Later he  became a ZAVNOH [National Antifascist Council for the National  Liberation of Croatia] deputy and a deputy of the AVNOJ. As a  well-known democrat he was even a royal deputy at the time the  Karadjordjevic dynasty was ousted and federal Yugoslavia was  established.    Hence, Istria has contributed its share to the leadership of  the antifascist struggle. This antifascist struggle was of  particular importance to Istria because the antifascist struggle  [pauses].... not only in Istria, for if there had been only that  which could have survived as antifascist in Istria then Istria  would not have survived as being Croatian as it would have been  subjected to the Italian fascists and the German Nazis.  [sentence as heard] Istria could have survived at that time, and  it can survive today, but only as an integral part of Croatia.  Those who [interrupted by applause, pauses].... And this is one  of the reasons why [applause] the state holiday devoted to the  antifascist struggle is celebrated here in Istria. We are also  celebrating this date because the antifascist struggle waged by  the Croatian people as a whole enabled Istria to become reunited  with mother Croatia--not only Istria, but Rijeka, Zadar, and the  Adriatic islands as well. This antifascist struggle enabled  Croatia to become a constituent part of the global democratic  coalition and, on the basis of this, to gain the right to build  its independence and sovereignty, to become a recognized member  of the international community.    The celebration of antifascism in Istria should also be  marked so as to recall that all that Istria went through before  was the worst tragedy for Croatian national consciousness and  the Croatian nation. Many have forgotten this. They are even  promising Istria some kind of better days. If this is so, let  us recall what has been happening to Istria in the recent past,  since World War I, from the London Treaty to the Rapallo Treaty,  since the time the European imperialists wanted to settle their  accounts and imperialist divisions by using Croatia and Croatian  lands.    Following World War I, at the time of the disintegration of  the Hapsburg monarchy, genuine Croatian patriots were advocating  Croatia's unification with Serbia and other south Slav lands,  not so much because of illusions but because of practical  political interests and needs, in order to prevent the  implementation of the London Treaty by which the European powers  promised not only Istria but also Dalmatia to Italy, and, if  unification did not materialize, Slavonia and Bosnia to Serbia.  Therefore, Croatian patriots--those from Istria as well, people  like Ante Mandic--were thinking of ways to prevent the disaster  from occurring. This was accomplished through the creation of  the new state. Dalmatia did not become part of Italy, Slavonia  and Bosnia were not taken away from Croatia, but Istria remained  under Italian occupation. And what happened? Members of other  nations comprising the Hapsburg monarchy were immediately  released from internment camps, but not Istrian Croats and  Slovenes. They remained imprisoned. What ensued was a lurid  time for the Croatian people in Istria. The Italian occupation  authorities began persecuting everybody, from the common folk to  the most influential people, from the peasants and laborers,  teachers and priests to everything that had meant something  among the people. [sentence as heard]    Under the pretext that they were looking for weapons, the  Italian carabinieri were searching Croatian homes, stealing all  valuable objects, and setting Croatian homes on fire. For  instance, in Krnica in 1921 fascists killed two peasants and  locked up 89, set 26 houses on fire, and looted the area. This  unbearable situation led to the well-known uprising of miners in  Labin in 1921, and on 28 February 1921 the Labin republic was  proclaimed. The reasons for this were not just social and [word  indistinct] but also national.    The main witchhunt continued against all those who kept the  Croatian spirit alive in Istria, above all against teachers and  priests. It is estimated that in the first days of Italian rule  about 2,000 public workers were interned in Sardinia and Lipari  near Trieste. Many were expelled from Istria, and their places  were taken by Italians, including village sisters, teachers, and  others. A (?Krk) bishop (?Mandic) was imprisoned, and Andrija  Karlin from Trieste was expelled. In Italy in 1919 35 Croatian  priests were interned, and 23 priests were imprisoned. One  hundred and eight priests and 180 lay priests were expelled  across the border, and 15 [word indistinct] convents were closed  down.    Most serious crimes were committed during the elections of  1921. Even when it was not an entirely fascist state Croatia  took advantage of the fascist movement, giving it financial and  moral support. This movement and its paramilitary formations,  the Black Shirts, used all methods of terror: beating,  intimidation, and preventing the expression of Croatian national  consciousness. Decrees of 1923 to 1927 changed Croatian names  and surnames, as well as names of places, to Italian ones. One  decree even banned what they called ridiculous non-Italian names.    Gentlemen, try to recall these times and how important it  was, despite all of this, to preserve the Croatian  consciousness, but only through links with the Croatian state  and not through a desire to separate Istria from Croatia.  [applause]    In these years the majority of Croatian and Slovene schools  in the Slovene part were banned. The Italian language was  introduced as a mandatory subject in (?382) schools. Italian  teachers were brought in and the Croatian ones expelled. In the  Croatian part of the Koper district alone seven Croatian schools  either came under Italian administration or were shut down. The  same fate was shared by 19 schools in the Pazin district, 34 in  the Pula district and all but two in Porec district. All  Croatian papers, newspapers, and books were banned. Of all the  writings in Croatian only the book of prayers remained: Our  Father, Thy will be done. This will is sometimes under duress  but it will be done by the being that is the essence of all  Croats. [sentence as heard]    The abolition of all Croatian educational, economic, [word  indistinct], and sports associations, the abolition of all  organizations, led to the Italianization and de-Croatization of  Istria. Fascist terror in Istria assumed such proportions as  rarely seen in Europe.    By resorting to open terror, they stage-managed various show  trials: The most notorious one in Istria was the one of patriot  Vladimir Gortan and his comrades from Berm. It would be  impossible to recount all the hardships Istria had gone through  during the Italian fascist occupation. In one year  alone--1934-35--our people were sentenced to 431 years in the  dungeon. While the Croats were persecuted and jailed in this  way, the Italians and the pro-Italian independence seekers were  buying up Croatian land and doing what some are using today to  claim that Istria is Italian.    This persecution and impoverishment of the Croatian people  in  Istria resulted in the expulsion of some 100,000 Croats from  Istria. Of this number, some 70,000 Croats moved to Croatia and  other southern Slav countries while around 25,000 emigrated to  North America and around 5,000 left for Belgium and France.  This exodus of the Croatian people from Istria was joined by  another 40,000 Croats from the regions occupied by the Italian  occupation army following the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1941.    All of this persecution, this terror, this policy of  Istria's  de-Croatization did not achieve the desired results. But the  consequences of this will even be exploited today as an impetus  for continuing such policies. No wonder the demographic picture  of Istria was altered with the persecution of Croats and the  colonization of Italians--not only officials and Carabinieri,  but also workers, [word indistinct], road builders, lumberjacks,  teachers, and others. The demographic picture was not the only  thing that had changed. This left a deep psychological and  political imprint. To hell with that, gentlemen, brothers, and  sisters, we shall heal these wounds and we shall not allow  Istria to be ruled by the consequences of such a situation.  [applause]    This is how Istria entered World War II, when the  antifascist  struggle began in Croatia. The antifascist leadership of  Croatia, headed by Andrija Hebrang, immediately comprehended its  historic task: that it should kindle and organize the  antifascist struggle in Istria. From the very first day of the  antifascist struggle in Croatia it considered Istria to be an  inalienable part of the antifascist struggle and a constituent  part of Croatia. It directed the antifascist struggle on such a  basis, and I personally know Istrians who were in Zagreb at the  time and whom the leadership of Croatia's antifascist struggle  was sending to Istria and Gorski Kotar to organize the  antifascist struggle in Istria from Gorski Kotar. [applause]    Of course, the Italian fascist occupiers were particularly  bent on weeding out any possible form of antifascist resistance  in Istria, and that is why the beginning of the armed struggle  here, the organizing of Partisan units and bodies of antifascist  authority was extremely difficult; so the antifascist struggle  in Istria had to be directed from Gorski Kotar.    The National Liberation Movement in Istria grew somewhat in  size in 1942 when, led by the Communist Party of Croatia, a  directive was issued, and district committees for Istria and  other antifascist bodies of the antifascist struggle in Istria  were formed.    The fifth battalion of the Primorsko-Goranski Partisan  Detachment was formed in Gorski Kotar in May 1942 with the task  of going to Istria and setting in motion the antifascist  struggle there. But the power of the Italian fascist occupier  ... [pauses] and the oppression of the Croatian people in Istria  was such that it was unable to provide support and so this  battalion was unable to break through there. However, attempts  to break up the antifascist struggle were resumed. In the  second half of 1943 a group of fighters moved from the area of  Ilirska Bistrica and pitched camp on (Planik) but was unable to  maintain itself there either. It had to return to Gorski Kotar.  With the repeated attempt of the Istrian Croats who were there,  and as a result of the efforts of the Croatian antifascist  leadership, an Istrian Partisan unit was re-formed in the area  of Gerovo and sent back to Istria. The Istrian detachment known  as Vladimir Gortan was founded in August 1942 from the Istrians  who fought in Gorski Kotar and in other Croatian areas -- and  they were in all Croatian regions, something which indicates the  unity of Croatian Istria.    In September, following the capitulation of Italy, a general  uprising of the Croatian people broke out. It was led by  antifascist organizations. Italian military formations were  disarmed, and virtually the whole population of Croatian Istria  took part in this general Croatian uprising. About 9,000  Italian soldiers were disarmed. About 18,000 people took part  in this antifascist movement at that time. By 11 September 1943  virtually the whole of Istria was liberated, apart from Pula,  Koper, and Izola.    The National Liberation Committee for Istria proclaimed the  unification of Istria and Croatia on 13 September 1943. The  proclamation says: The spirit of Istria has remained  unsubjugated. We did not want to become obedient slaves. In  these decisive moments our people have demonstrated a high level  of national consciousness. They have proved to all and sundry  that Istria is a Croatian land and that it will remain Croatian  [applause].    Let those who do not like to hear these words here today  ponder this historical document.    This historic document further says: Relying on their own  resources and not waiting for others to bring them freedom, the  Istrians rose and stormed the barracks, seizing arms which are  to be used in defense of their right to liberty; they opened  wide the notorious prison gates and released the proud sons of  unsubjugated Istria; never again shall we allow others to  manipulate our fate; the Italian garrisons are in our hands;  Italian soldiers are fleeing our soil; the people are taking the  helm into their own hands for the first time in history; Istria  is joining the motherland and is declaring unification with the  rest of our Croatian brothers [applause].    We are firmly holding these arms, the proclamation told  Istrians. Let us stand at the bulwark of liberty and let us not  allow anybody to take it away ever again; we must remain masters  in our own home; the proclamation ends by saying "Long Live  Croatian Istria" and by hailing the members of the antifascist  democratic coalition, Yugoslavia among them.    This decision by the Istrian (?National Liberation) Council  on unification with Croatia was confirmed by ZAVNOH, the  National Antifascist Council for the People's Liberation of  Croatia, on 20 September 1943, which on this occasion anulled  all treaties, pacts, and conventions concluded by the Kingdom of  Yugoslavia and later the NDH [Independent State of Croatia] in  relation to Istria.    In mid-September 1943, the main HQS of the Croatian Partisan  army sent a large number of military commanders to Istria to  organize new units. The operative HQS for Istria was formed  here in Pazin on 23 September. The First Istrian Brigade,  Vladimir Gortan, was also formed in September, as well as the  Second Istrian Brigade, the First Partisan Ucka Unit and the  Second Pula Unit. At the same time a brigade and unit were  formed in the Slovene part.    However, what ensued was the occupation of Istria by the  German Nazi army. This occupation was just as oppressive, so  oppressive that it managed to push back the partisan forces;  moreover, it again gave free reign to those who had ruled during  the Italian fascist occupation, the pro-Italian independence  seekers, and all those anti-Croatian elements. Italian  secessionists in Istria were emboldened by this occupation.    Of course, the Croatian leadership did not give up the idea  to continue the antifascist struggle in Istria, to nurture the  Croatian spirit in Istria, and to create conditions for Istria's  unification with Croatia after the war. In such circumstances  and regardless of the difficulties encountered in the military  sense, representative bodies of the antifascist movement were  being formed in Istria. In addition to the Provincial National  Liberation Council -- which was later renamed the Regional  Council -- there were three district councils: in Pazin, Buzet,  and Pula; there were 13 district councils, 37 municipal  councils, 3 city councils and 330 local village councils with  more than 1,800 deputies.    The number of fighters increased again -- from 1,300 in  February 1944 to more than 4,000 in April. At that time the  leadership of the Croatian antifascist movement decided to form  new Istrian brigades. The Vladimir Gortan Istrian Brigade was  formed on Mount Ucka on 1 April. A conference of the Croatian  antifascist youth of Istria was held the same day, and was  attended by some 800 delegates.    The Pino Budicin Battalion was formed of fighters of Italian  nationality on 4 April near Bale.    The Ucka partisan unit was formed on 6 April and the second  Pula unit was formed on 11 April. However, all these would not  have been sufficient to liberate Istria, and the Croatian  leadership passed a decision to form the 43d Istrian Division in  Gorski Kotar. This division included the 1st, the 2nd, and the  3d Istrian Brigades, while the Buzet-Porec unit was formed as an  auxiliary unit in Istria.    All in all, upheld by the spirit of Croatian Istrians and by  the special concern of the Croatian antifascist leadership, the  antifascist struggle in Istria was continuous. About 30,000  soldiers took part in the antifascist struggle. Five to six  thousand fighters fell in this struggle -- the figure is not  precise, it is high time that the precise figure is established.  There were about 25,000 members in the youth antifascist  organization. I have already spoken about the national power  committees. There was also a women's antifascist organization.    Those Istrians who were forcibly mobilized into the Italian  Army joined the overseas brigades after the capitulation of  Italy. These brigades later became part of the partisan units.  The Italian and German occupying forces in Istria killed --  according to the information at my disposal -- 4,285 of its  citizens; 21,509 persons were taken to concentration camps;  5,595 houses were burned down or destroyed.    In this antifascist struggle Istria gave a large  contribution  toward the toppling of fascism, its liberation, the annexation  with Croatia and toward the victory of antifascism in Croatia.  Istria has 10 people's heroes: Olga Ban, Dragomir Bencic, Mateo  Benussi, Mate Blazina, Tino Budicin, Jurica Kalac, Joakim  Rakovac, Jovan Stokovac, Joza Suran and Agustin [last name  indistinct]. Istria has a lot to be proud of -- with its  contribution in the antifascist struggle. This contribution and  the lives which Istria had given put us under the obligation to  honor the proclamation of Istria: that Istria has been and will  always be a Croatian land. [applause]    Despite the fact that during the fascist occupation and the  antifascist war a large part of the Italian minority stayed  close to the Italian occupying authorities -- which resulted in  strong hatred between the local Croatian population and the  Italian minority -- nevertheless, a process was under way even  at that time to create an alliance between Croatian patriots and  Italian democrats and antifascists. This helped to provide the  possibility for setting up Italian units and for laying the  foundations of cooperation between the majority Croatian people  and the Italian minority in the region at a later stage and  today.    However, the victorious end to the antifascist war in  Croatia  and former Yugoslavia, as I said, under the leadership of the  Croats Andrija Hebrang and Vladimir Nazor in Croatia and Josip  Broz and Ribar in Yugoslavia -- and this was not a coincidence  -- this victorious end which resulted in the genuine integration  of Istria in the mother country, this victorious outcome, meant  that the dreams of the Croatian patriots within the Renaissance  Movement and generally of the Croatian people in the region had  come true. But, during the socialist Yugoslavia and socialist  Croatia they were let down even, as I said, when it came to the  anniversary day and in everyday politics, in particular.    Today Istria must remember that Croat statehood in Istria,  that the antifascist struggle in Istria, could not have been  possible without those Istrian champions of the Croatian  Renaissance Movement who had close links with the Croatian  nation's 19th Century Renaissance Movement, in general.    Juraj Dobrila, Dr Dinko Vitezic, Matko Bastijan, Matko  Mandic, Dr. Anton Mahnic, and Dr. Matko Laginja, a lawyer and  writer who at the time of the creation of the common state was  in charge of the initiative to incorporate Istria in the mother  country, were all Croatian champions of the Renaissance Movement  in Istria. Of course, a special place among these is reserved  for Vjekoslav Stincic, and Bozo Milanovic, a priest who took up  and further promoted the traditions of the Croatian Renaissance  Movement and who, in the socialist period after World War II and  at the Paris Conference, had the courage to say that Istria was  Croatian and could be neither Slovene nor anyone else's. This  was recorded in international diplomatic (?documents) [applause]    I have already mentioned Dr. Anton Mandic -- not just  because  he played a prominent role as a Croatian politician from Istria  between the two world wars, but also because after World War II  he was the one who was aware of something that tends to be  ignored today, the man who was aware that Croatia [as heard]  would have to be extensively linked with its mother country of  Croatia, who tried to persuade Josip Broz as far back as 1945  and 1946 to have a road and rail tunnel built under Mount Ucka  to link Istria with Croatia. He also suggested other measures  -- and I personally spoke to him about them. People of this type  are often forgotten nowadays and instead, ideas are promoted  which advocate that Istria be singled out as something special.    In the socialist period Istria was neglected because the  Croatian communists who came to power in Zagreb after Hebrang  did not know how to pursue a correct national policy. Theirs  was an internationalist policy. I personally heard them say  that in socialism it did not matter whether Istria was Croatian,  Slovene, or Italian. These people were playing games with the  fate of both Istria and Croatia. But those times have long  gone. The centuries-long struggle of the Croatian people in  general and of Istria in particular ended with the creation of  the independent and democratic Croatia which will know how to  compensate for the evil deeds and injustices committed against  Istria. These are, above all, reflected in the fact that  foreign occupation, or more specifically the Italian occupation,  and the anti-nationalist and anti-Croatian policy by socialist  authorities, resulted in the gradual reduction of -- and not  just by Italian but also earlier by the policy of the Habsburgs  -- resulted in the gradual reduction in the size of the Croatian  population in Istria.    Any normal person must take heed of the fact that in 1846  there were 134,455 Croats living in Istria, that in 1919 there  were 181,605 Croats in Istria, and that in 1981 that number was  134,890 -- or as many as 140 years ago but fewer than 70 years  ago -- and that between 1981 and 1991 the number of Croats in  Istria dropped to 111,593. These are the consequences of  Istria's special position and of a policy designed to alienate  Istria and to undermine its Croatian identity. [applause]    Present-day democratic Croatia can and must rectify the  situation. [applause]    The state and political leadership of present-day Croatia,  who, despite the unfavorable domestic and international  situation, knew how to go about creating a democratic,  independent, sovereign, autonomous Croatia, to ensure not merely  its international recognition but to see it accepted within the  world international system as a serious factor in creating a new  international order in this part of southeastern Europe -- this  leadership will know how to resolve all problems facing the  Croatian people and the Croatian state in Istria. This Croatian  leadership will know how to ensure Croatia's economic, cultural  and democratic development.    But we shall not allow ideas which -- whether those who  promote them in the name of Istria's alleged special position  like it or not -- we see as direct continuation of the situation  which led to Istria losing some of its Croatian characteristics.    So let me repeat: Just as Croatian national consciousness  was maintained in Istria by virtue of the fact that Croatian  revivalists from Istria were linked with Croatian revivalists in  the 19th Century, so the antifascist struggle in Istria could  develop and bring both the victory of antifascism to this  movement in Istria and the decision, adopted in 1943, to join  and unite with the homeland of Croatia. This was because  Istria's antifascist struggle was linked -- and not merely  linked but had its foundations and drew its strength from and  had its base in the entire antifascist struggle in Croatia.    Hence the reality of Istria today -- including political,  economic and any other reality -- can advance and develop only  if linked, or if you like only if linked even more closely, with  Croatia than all the other counties of Croatia, precisely  because Istria has suffered such consequences and because claims  are being made [applause]. And ladies and gentlemen, dear  Croatian brothers and sisters, and all citizens of Istria, as a  result of all those theories and political programs which talk  of Istria as a separate entity and of Istria as a transborder  region and of the demilitarization of Istria, of the separate  Istrian people, of the self-sufficiency of Istria and even the  exploitation of Istria by the rest of Croatia are not only  harmful but possibly dangerous and fateful.    Those behind these ideas -- whether they are aware of this  or  not -- these are all a continuation of those policies and that  situation which brought about such circumstances that made us  feel the consequences in Istria of foreign government and of the  foreign political occupation about which I have spoken.    These theories and these political programs -- regardless of  how many democratic trappings they may have -- play into the  hands of those who, both publicly and in secret, stress rights,  not only in Istria but also in Rijeka and Dalmatia. And it  should not be forgotten that in earlier times Italian  irredentists and imperialists knew how to exploit the supporters  of Italian rule in Istria and Rijeka and the idea of  denationalization. They would even cede Rijeka to Italy, which  otherwise, according to peace treaties, was not envisaged for  unification with Italy. So they knew how to use these phenomena  on our territory and they would know how to exploit these  regionalist ideas today just as formerly the pro-Italian  independence seekers did, [applause].    Naturally, the Croatian people, which have demonstrated  their  national and democratic maturity, which have established their  own independent and democratic state, their sovereign state,  will not allow these ideas to develop into a real threat.  [applause].    And as I have said, this democratic Croatia itself will know  how to bring Istria into Europe. Furthermore, Croatia was a  constituent part of Europe throughout its history and was at the  top in terms of all civic activities, as a constituent part of  central Europe. What has happened in the last 20 or so years  when it was Balkanized has not changed anything in essence,  while today, as I have said, Croatia is a recognized factor in  the world with which all relevant and important European and  world factors reckon.    Today, democratic Croatia not only has friends and allies  but it has an international position which enables it to defend  its sovereign rights and enables it to liberate still occupied  territories with the aid of the international community if  possible. If this is impossible then all means will be used  with the understanding of the international community because  the international community is aware that democratic Croatia is  conducting a just, peaceful policy and that it wants to be a  factor of peace and cooperation between the nations in this part  of Europe. [applause]    We must not allow any regional ideas which would be a  continuation of pro-autonomy and pro-Italian movements in a  negative sense in this territory but we also must not forget  that Italian fascist occupiers -- even though they were  ostensibly allies of Pavelic's NDH -- established links with  chetniks from Knin during World War II and that they are doing  the same today, that they are being visited by certain Italian  senators in Knin and at their gatherings. They are even making  some ridiculous jokes about establishing some kind of relations.    Therefore, even today we have these trends in our territory  and despite political and other changes they are present all the  time -- an attempt to cooperate between Italian fascist  imperialism and irredentism and greater Serbian imperialism --  this has to be borne in mind here in Istria all the time.  [applause]    This association of Italian fascists and irredentists and  the  Knin rebels against Croatia looks funny and it is funny, but it  could be tragic if we were to forget that even the smallest of  dangers can become a huge threat if it is not taken into  account. Democratic Croatia wants to cooperate with democratic  Italy and to secure all ethnic minority rights for the Italian  minority in Istria and Rijeka, in accordance with international  conventions. However, we demand the same for the Croatian  minority in Italy, from Trieste to [word indistinct]. The  Croatian minority in Italy is larger than the Italian minority  here. We demand reciprocity.    We hope that the present regime in Italy will continue the  policy of its democratic governments: good-neighborly relations  with Croatia and Slovenia. We hope that they will respect all  agreements and treaties signed after World War II. Croatia is  open and ready and wants relations which are as friendly and  wide-ranging as possible with democratic Italy. It is prepared  to discuss all issues regarding the rights of an ethnic minority  but as I said this must also be true for the Croatian minority  in Italy.    I believe that in democratic Italy the kind of wisdom will  prevail which led Italy out of fascism into the fold of the  world's democratic countries which also signed these agreements  upon which we are today building our mutual relations.  Consequently, if we do not attach too much importance to what  is being articulated as an irredentist and imperialist drive  toward Istria, Rijeka, and Dalmatia, we nevertheless must not  ignore such phenomena precisely because they are being linked  with Serbian imperialism and its anti-Croatian policies in  Croatia and the area of the former Yugoslavia as a whole. This  is why we favor a situation whereby we can develop in every way,  by all means, friendly and good-neighborly relations with the  Italian people and the democratic Italy.    Ladies and gentlemen, my dear friends, as I have said,  Croatia has won friends and allies in the whole world due to the  stability of its democratic system and the correctness of its  policies. Today, Croatia can say that it has friends and allies  in the world's most powerful power, in the United States. We  also have friendly relations with huge China at the other end of  the world. We also have friendly relations with the European  Union [EU] and friendly relations with the main EU countries and  with Islamic countries. Croatia's international position is such  that it also safeguards the stability of Croatia's internal  development.    In economic terms, despite all the consequences of war,  Croatia has in a sense performed an economic miracle to the  surprise and bafflement of serious people and those who were not  sympathetic to us. Our government has managed to slash the  inflation rate to an extent achieved by few countries in Europe.  Or rather, none of the ex-socialist countries has managed to do  so to the same extent. We have today our national currency, the  kuna which is already a stable convertible currency [applause].  This national currency of ours has already been included among  the world's financial indicators. Croatia is still,  understandably, facing its main task -- to liberate its occupied  areas [applause].    As I said, we are going to continue our policy; on our part  we are going to do everything to bring about a peaceful  incorporation in agreement with the international community and  with its support and that of the United Nations, so the UN  Security Council resolutions on the incorporation of these areas  into Croatia can be implemented peacefully. Understandably, if  these efforts remain futile and if the international community  and the UN turn out to be helpless then the Croatian people as a  sovereign people will be capable and will know how to use all  means to restore the constitutional and legal order across their  entire homeland. [applause]    Let me finish, please. I understand the impatience and  justified anger of our refugees, from Baranja and Vukovar to  Rijeka or Dubrovnik, to Banija and Kordun. At the same time I  call on them: be patient for a little while, trust this Croatian  state leadership who knew how to establish an independent and  sovereign Croatia, who knew how to win friends and allies. We  shall know how to do everything possible to liberate Croatia's  occupied areas without casualties.    We are also going to do everything we have to -- if we have  to -- to help you return to your homes, to the ruins of your  burned-down houses. We are going to help you restore them. I  have been meeting you all over Croatia. Understandably, you  cannot remain homeless while Serbian occupation forces reign on  Croatian territory.    Consequently, the sovereign and democratic Croatia has known  and will know what it wants. We needed friends and allies in  the world and we knew how to win them. On the other hand, the  world's democratic forces need a stable and democratic Croatia.  This is the kind of Croatia that will remain because the  Croatian people have realized that they have restored Croatian  sovereignty through their sacrifices and skills in all Croatian  regions, in all Croatian areas, counties.    What remains is what I said was their immediate task. But  this Croatia has its position in the international order. This  Croatia is today respected by everyone, including those who at  some stage did not want it to exist.    The antifascist struggle of the Croatian people in the  whole of Croatia, including Istria, hugely contributed to the  very foundations of this democratic Croatia. Without the  contribution of the antifascist struggle there would be no  independent and democratic Croatia today. This is something the  democratic Croatian authorities will bear in mind.    Likewise, members of Croatia's antifascist movement in World  War II must bear in mind the fact that Croatia is preoccupied  with the problems of its current war and with everything else we  are facing today, so it has not been able to pay enough  attention to those members of the antifascist movement who were  partly in the service of Croatia's state freedom and Croatian  statehood idea, just as they were also -- if they were members  of the Serbian people -- gripped by the idea that a Croatian  state should not be allowed to exist. [sentence as heard]    Consequently, these members of the antifascist movement of  Serbian nationality must also understand this reality; they must  understand that the essence of antifascist struggle in Croatia  was the struggle for Croatian freedom, for Croatian statehood.  I want to recall that even the Serbian units in Banija and  Kordun were flying the Croatian flag. This is the essential  feature which decisively characterized the antifascist movement  of Croatia. This is why we have incorporated antifascism into  the foundations of Croatian freedom, Croatian statehood.    Likewise, all members of the antifascist struggle must  understand that they must get rid of their notions if what they  saw in it was a struggle against some kind of independent  Croatian state. This desperation of the Croatian people in  World War II, this very complex situation, was to some extent  clearly reflected in the situation brought about in the wake of  the proclamation of independent Croatia, in the rebellion of the  Serbs from Knin and elsewhere, who were directly instructed by  the Yugoslav communist army and Belgrade. Consequently, all of  this is a reality suggesting that we must bear in mind these  problems in their entirety, including the antifascist struggle  as well as the struggle for Croatian freedom and a Croatian  state.    Hence, let us pay eternal tribute to the honour and glory of  members of the antifascist struggle of Croatia and of Istria  within the same context. Long live Croatian Istria in this  democratic and sovereign Croatia.</p>

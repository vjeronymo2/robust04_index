			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REUNIFICATION OF GERMANY  </P> <P> As a Vietnam-era veteran, I can appreciate the bad times Rummel and his family  suffered due to Germany's initiation of World War II. But the experiences he  shared in his commentary are words of a man whose country lost a war. I wonder  what Rummel would have written on Oct. 3, 1990, if Germany had claimed victory  in 1945! I say let Germany earn the trust of our democracy.  </P> <P> ART GOMEZ  </P> <P> San Gabriel  </P></p>

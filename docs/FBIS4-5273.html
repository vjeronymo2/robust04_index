			<p>BFN     [Text] In response to a series of crashes involving U.S.  military aircraft, Okinawa Prefectural Governor Ota hastily flew  to Tokyo on the morning of 7 April to ask the government to take  measures to prevent a recurrence of such crashes. The Ginowan  city assembly and political parties and labor organizations on  Okinawa are increasingly reacting against the crashes by taking  measures to protest the crashes. The Futenma Air Station is  located in the middle of Ginowan city, and the Ginowan city  assembly has held a session of the Committee on U.S. Military  Bases. The assembly is expected to hold an extraordinary  session on 8 April at the earliest to adopt a resolution  protesting against the crashes. At Naha airport, Governor Ota  expressed his firm resolve to strongly ask the Foreign Ministry,  the Defense Agency, and the Defense Facilities Administration  Agency to take measures to prevent a recurrence of such crashes,  saying, "If the government does not take a more serious view of  the crashes, it will be too late for the government to take  steps to prevent them after disasters have occurred."    Labor organizations and the Federation of Okinawa  Prefectural  Trade Unions have staged rallies near Kadena Air Base to protest  against the crashes, and this unprecedented situation in which  two crashes in a row have occurred is heightening anger and  apprehension among Okinawans.    Commenting on the crash of a medium-type CH-transport  helicopter, the Okinawa Public Affairs Office of the Marine  Corps explained on the morning of 7 April that the helicopter,  which was involved in emergency landing training, crashed into a  runway just prior to landing. The Public Affairs Office said  that four crewmen were slightly injured, and that the Marine  Corps has begun investigating the cause of the crash after  having received reports from the helicopter's pilots.    As for the cause of the crash, the Public Affairs Office  repeated its conventional line, saying, "The Marine Corps does  not make public the results of investigations into this kind of  crash. The release of the results is up to negotiations between  the Governments of Japan and the United States."    In an interview with the OKINAWA TIMES at Naha airport prior  to his departure for Tokyo, Governor Ota expressed his anger  over the crashes, saying: "The U.S. Forces on Okinawa have  repeatedly said that such accidents would not occur. We can no  longer permit such accidents to occur near Okinawans'  residential areas." In the interview, Governor Ota stressed the  need for the government to speedily take measures to prevent  such crashes from occurring in the future, saying, "I intend to  let the government ask the U.S. side to fundamentally resolve  problems arising from U.S. military bases on Okinawa and to ban  military aircraft considered to be dangerous from flying over  Okinawa."    The Okinawa prefectural governor will call on the foreign  minister and on the director generals of the Defense Agency and  the Defense Facilities Administration Agency to ask the U.S.  side to succeed in having U.S. Forces on Okinawa operate their  military bases safely and to work to prevent a recurrence of  such crashes.    The Okinawa chapters of the opposition Liberal Democratic  Party, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], the Social Democratic  Party of Japan, and the Japan Communist Party have protested to  the Naha Defense Facilities Administration Agency over the  crashes involving U.S. military aircraft.</p>

			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: OUTRAGE MAKES MOUNTAINEER OUT OF MOLEHILL  </P> <P> They hung a bra on the Mountaineer statue at the University of West Virginia  this week. They made buttons and bumper stickers saying: "We don't want a  Mountaindear. Give us back our Mountaineer."  </P> <P> Natalie Tennant won a "cheer-off" last spring and was named West Virginia's  first female mascot.  </P> <P> Tennant will make her debut today when West Virginia opens its football season  at home against Kent State.  </P> <P> She told the Associated Press that she expects to be booed. After she won the  cheer-off, she said, students began chanting: "Go back to the kitchen!"  </P> <P> Said Tennant: "They didn't know that I can't cook."  </P> <P> Trivia time: Who is the only major league player to hit a home run in each of  the first four games of a season?  </P> <P> Mr. Science: At 74, Jerry Barber, golf pro at Griffith Park, is the oldest  regular player on the senior tour.  </P> <P> In a recent tournament, Barber approached the green after hitting a good  approach shot. When the applause faded, he turned to the gallery and said,  "That shot comes from 50 years of research."  </P> <P> Back door blues: England's Peter Elliott reached today's final of the  1,500-meter run in the European Track and Field Championships at Split,  Yugoslavia, by way of a jury decision. Officials ruled that Elliott's fall 600  meters from the finish of his semifinal heat Thursday was caused by East  Germany's Hauke Fuhlbruegge, who was disqualified.  </P> <P> Representatives of Spain, Switzerland, Italy, Portugal and the Netherlands, who  among them have seven finalists, filed a joint protest, asking for Elliott's  removal, citing a rule that requires a finalist to finish the semifinal.  </P> <P> Elliott told John Rodda of the Guardian: "In my heart of hearts, I don't really  think it is right that I'm in the race. I didn't run right through to the  finishing post."  </P> <P> Add Elliott: His left arm, strained in the fall, is heavily bandaged down to  his fingers.  </P> <P> He told Rodda: "The problem is I can't do up my shoelaces, but Crammie  (England's Steve Cram) has promised to tie them for me when we get on the  track."  </P> <P> Wrote Rodda: "Separately, one hopes."  </P> <P> Brain trust: In the closing seconds of Tulane's football game against Memphis  State in 1989, Tulane Coach Greg Davis told quarterback Deron Smith to call the  next play at the line of scrimmage -- either a pass against an eight-man front  or a run against a seven-man front.  </P> <P> Smith threw a touchdown pass for a 38-34 victory.  </P> <P> Davis recently recalled his conversation with Smith after the quarterback came  off the field:  </P> <P> "How many down linemen did they have?" Davis asked.  </P> <P> "Three," Smith said.  </P> <P> "How many outside linebackers?"  </P> <P> "Two."  </P> <P> "How many inside linebackers?"  </P> <P> "Two."  </P> <P> "Deron, that's seven," Davis said.  </P> <P> "You're right, coach," Smith said. "If I was as smart as you, we'd have lost  the game."  </P> <P> Feat of Clay?: Cleveland Brown linebacker Clay Matthews, who ended his  five-week holdout Thursday and will report to practice Monday, was unconcerned  when asked whether he would be ready for the Browns' season opener against  Pittsburgh Sept. 9.  </P> <P> Said Matthews: "Anybody can play with five warm-up games. It takes a man to  play in one week."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Willie Mays of the San Francisco Giants, April 6, 7, 8 and 10,  1971.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Washington Redskin Coach Joe Gibbs, when asked by reporters whether  he planned to keep Earnest Byner as his starting fullback or replace him with  Gerald Riggs: "You'll be the last to know."

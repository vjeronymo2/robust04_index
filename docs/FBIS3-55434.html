It is also against the  reduction of the imprisonment period. Valeriu Garbuz [prisoner  who acted as a witness incriminating the others] could be an  exception, states the OSTK declaration announced by the local  radio. The OSTK leaders believe that the transfer of the  convicted to another state could be made only on the basis of an  international agreement concerning this field. OSTK opposes  that Moldova's [February] general elections should also be held  in the Dniester Republic. OSTK does not support the idea of a  referendum on the future social and state order in the Dniester  region. The idea of this referendum was launched by the union  of parties, organizations, and social movements. In OSTK's  opinion, the results of the referendum can be used by enemies of  the Dniester Republic to undermine the state order.</p>

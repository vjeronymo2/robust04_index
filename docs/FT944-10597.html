			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / French UDF members raise poll stakes Leading members of France's centrist UDF, part of the centre-right governing coalition, warned yesterday they could back a candidate from another party in next year's presidential elections. The statement, by former industry minister Gerard Longuet among others, said they would not be bound to support a candidate from party ranks if it obstructed a single candidate from the coalition. The statement reflects a move by many in the party to support Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister and a member of the Gaullist RPR party, rather than Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, head of the UDF. Polls show Mr Balladur ahead of Mr Jacques Chirac, the RPR leader and the only serious contender yet to have announced his candidacy. However, an RPR party congress has been called for next weekend to endorse Mr Chirac's candidacy. The prime minister's standing has fallen in recent months partly because of a series of corruption scandals which have prompted the resignation of two ministers, including Mr Longuet. The French press has reported that Mr Michel Roussin, minister for economic co-operation, is implicated in an investigation into illicit political funding of the RPR.</p>

			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Arts: Figures in a surreal landscape - Photography LOOKING at the hundreds of photographs by Bill Brandt, assembled in the splendid retrospective at the Barbican, I did not see what I expected to see. The more I looked, the more mysterious those familiar images became, until I felt myself looking, not at a cherished record of recent history, but at a stranger, darker world. Image after image purported to illustrate the everyday lives of all manner of folk, pluckily surviving in air raid shelters or enjoying the sunshine in the park, but instead of convincing in their verisimilitude, they began to seem more and more like exercises in fantasy, the recreation of dreams. How could this be? How could Miss Hibbott, the Lyons Corner house 'nippy' whose day was one of a series recorded in 1939, or Alice, the stalwart barmaid of the 'Crooked Billet' (a strange and menacing name) at Tower Bridge be anything other than real, brought reassuringly to life in the Picture Post? Then I began to realise: the people are the problem. Only very rarely do their actions, their mundane lives, mesh with the grandeur of these dark compositions to make photograph and subject one - the miner having his back scrubbed beside the fire, taken in 1937, is perhaps the best example. Otherwise, their fate is more uncertain. Miss Hibbott, neat in her uniform, carrying her tray - so far so good. But what is this? A visit to the hairdresser? The hairdresser stands behind her, a huge corrugated metal tube in her hand, its monstrous coils just as important an element of the composition as Miss Hibbott's pretty face, smiling reservedly from beneath, its metallic framing completed by a row of mysterious containers gleaming on the rim of the washbasin. All the famous chronicles, from the earliest 'The English at Home' of 1936, onward, are heavy with this sense of tension, of figures caught in a drama whose meaning goes deeper than the mundane events chronicled. The late nudes, which by huge close up and careful composition render naked limbs into Henry Moore-like abstraction come as a relief, as perhaps they did for Brandt, after so many years serving the demands of his career as a photojournalist. For Brandt, always referred to as Britain's greatest photgrapher of the modern era, was at heart a surrealist, drawn not so much to the people his jobs required him to record but to the silent world of objects, from whose random conjunctures he could hope for revelation. His first photographs to be published, in the Surrealist journal Minotaure in 1935, were of a group of ship's figureheads, and this interest continued throughout his career, with his wartime work recording endangered buildings and afterwards in series such as 'Odd corners of Museums' for Lilliput, 1944. Brandt, born in Hamburg in 1904, came to England, his adopted home, in 1931. It had been a fantasy land for him in childhood, a place imagined from the colourful images of his beloved Beggarstaff brothers. And it is as a recorder of British life that he is celebrated. But he created as much as he observed, carefully staging scenes - stern Bobbies beneath streetlamps, boys peeping into a pub interior - to make a London as romanticised as that of Dickens. Only the glorious landscapes, of the Bronte country, Stonehenge, or a journey to Skye, can stand alone, their wild beauty matching any dream. Brandt's nudes trace the development of his work most clearly. 'Reflection' published in Lilliput in 1949, includes that favourite surrealist device, the open door, while a 1945 example shown barebreasted at the dining table, embodies that other favourite surrealist theme, sexuality at the heart of bourgeois respectability. Their development into near abstract studies, published in 'Perspective of Nudes' in 1961, by emphasising composition so determinedly, allowed him finally to transform flesh into form, taking it into the realm of abstract contemplation which was his true home. ***** The early work of one of Brandt's contemporaries at Lilliput and the first it celebrated purely as a photographer, Erwin Blumenfeld, may be seen in an intriging show at the Photographer's Gallery, celebrating his friendship with the artist Paul Citroen. While both worked as photographers, Citroen, who made an intriguing series of portraits of the artists and intellectuals who had gathered in Amsterdam by 1935, became chiefly celebrated for a series of collages begun in Amsterdam and continued while studying at the Bauhaus. Much influenced by the work of the Berlin Dada group of which both had been members, Citroen's collages such as Metropolis, 1923, or the American Girl, 1919, create a fantasy image of New York, the city he never visited but which became home for his friend in 1941. Citroen was first to try photography but it was Blumenfeld who made it his career, becoming the highest paid photographer of his time. While the nude studies and experiments with double images and gauzes of the 1930s shown here demonstrate the influence of Man Ray, they also indicate that ability to concentrate on the essence of the subject which was to make him such a celebrated fashion and advertising photographer, dominating the New York scene for nearly 20 years.

			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> 4 WHO REPORTED AVOCADO THEFTS GET REWARD MONEY  </P> <P> Four Ventura County residents collected rewards totaling $1,700 for tipping  police to avocado thieves in two Somis incidents, an industry spokesman said  Friday.  </P> <P> The rewards were given by the California Avocado Commission as part of its  $775,000 statewide anti-theft program.  </P> <P> This year, $30,000 of the program's funds are designated for rewards.  </P> <P> In both cases, ranch workers had investigated cars parked near avocado groves  when they discovered unauthorized men picking the pricey fruit.  </P> <P> The workers alerted Ventura County sheriff's deputies, who arrested the  suspects. The arrests resulted in the recovery of 4,150 pounds of avocados.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the commission estimated that $1 million to $2 million in  avocados are stolen from Ventura growers each year.  </P> <P> Five other rewards have been collected in Ventura County since the avocado  commission started its program in February -- two in Camarillo and three in  Fillmore.

			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: NORWALK AND ARTESIA;  </P> <P> LATINO ACTIVIST GROUP PROPOSES PROGRAM FOR PRESCHOOL CHILDREN TO STEER THEM  AWAY FROM GANG INVOLVEMENT  </P> <P> A Latino civic organization is proposing an anti-gang program for preschoolers  living in a neighborhood on the border of Norwalk and Artesia.  </P> <P> Members of local Chapter 2009 of the League of United Latin American Citizens  (LULAC), a nationwide Latino organization, say they will take a survey to  determine how many children and their parents reside in the area, which for  years has been ravaged by fighting between two gangs.  </P> <P> After the survey is completed, the group will ask the two cities and the ABC  and Norwalk-La Mirada school districts that serve the area to develop a program  for 3- and 4-year-olds to steer them away from joining gangs, said Ray  Rodriguez, president of Chapter 2009.  </P> <P> Rodriguez said the program would include both education and recreation  activities. Details would be worked out later.  </P> <P> "We need to determine how we can prevent young children from getting involved  in gangs. We must attack the situation at the preschool level," Rodriguez said.  </P> <P> ABC school board member Sally Morales Havice said she supports some type of  preschool program for the area that would include both parents and their  children. Havice said: "Law enforcement and the cities are spending money to  protect the citizens, and that's what should be done. But people are saying  what are we doing to prevent the cycle of violence."  </P> <P> About 50 LULAC members, city and school officials, including Norwalk Councilman  Robert E. White and Havice and Sheriff's Department personnel, met Monday at  Norwalk City Hall to discuss methods of dealing with violence between a gang  called Barrio Norwalk and the Chivas gang of Artesia. The gangs are separated  by 166th Street, which is the dividing line between south Norwalk and north  Artesia.  </P> <P> The meeting, scheduled by members of LULAC, was held out of concern after the  latest violence that occurred June 22. Jesus E. Diaz, 16, a reputed member of  the Chivas gang, was shot and killed while attending a graduation party on the  north side of 166th Street in Barrio Norwalk territory. Nine others were  injured when three attackers fired a shotgun and handguns into a crowd of about  100.  </P> <P> No one has been arrested. Deputies said there have been no reprisals.  </P> <P> Both cities, which are served by the Sheriff's Department, have increased their  law enforcement efforts since the latest shooting.  </P> <P> "The area has been saturated (with deputies) to discourage any retaliation,"  said Lt. John Radeleff of the Norwalk substation.  </P></p>

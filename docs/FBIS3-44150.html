In his brief remarks during the opening of the talks,  President Museveni said, in order to promote trade between  Uganda and Eritrea, it will be highly beneficial to rely on  businessmen in the two countries. He added that businessmen  are crucial in promoting trade because they have to control  themselves in their daily transactions and are also disciplined  by fear of bankruptcy. Mr. Museveni noted that there is a  complementarity [as heard] between the two countries and it is  important for businessmen to study and carry out a survey,  especially on items that can be offered by each country for the  sake of profitable interaction. He said that Eritrea can also  offer salt and other products to Uganda while Uganda can give  grain and other food products to Eritrea. President Museveni  noted that air links are crucial for businessmen to carry out  trade. He said that businessmen need to be facilitated with  fast and reliable means of travel so that they are able to carry  out transactions profitably. He added that it is important for  Eritreans and Ugandans to interact so as to dispel the problem  of ignorance and lack of information that hinders easy  exploitation of available opportunities.    On his part, President Afewerki said that there is need to  harness economic cooperation at regional and subregional levels  in the context of the higher competitive global markets. He  expressed gratitude to the people of Uganda for their  hospitality shown to him. He commended the leadership of the  National Resistance Movement, which he said has given him  enlightenment on how to approach and stimulate the economy to  ensure growth and development as well as an approach to  bilateral cooperation. He noted that the relationship between  the two countries is essential and could be implemented in the  subregion which has many opportunities to offer. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The "Tripolar Forum for North Pacific Security,"  which was held in a Tokyo hotel (under the auspices of the Japan  Institute for International Issues), ended 2 February. It was  attended by concerned government and private representatives of  three countries; Japan, the United States, and Russia.    During discussions, which were held for two days, the United  States and Russia proposed that joint military exercises among  Japan, the United States, and Russia in north Pacific regions be  carried out. Japan disapproved the proposal, citing, among  other things, that: 1) the forum's purpose is not to counteract  other nations except the three countries; and 2) there are  things needed to be done first, including fostering trust.    At the forum, the participants agreed that it is definitely  important for Russian reform efforts to take root for stability  in the region.</p>

In Connection With This Event We  Are Publishing Comments on Russia by Well Known American  Politicians and Public Figures"]    [Text] Strobe Talbott, special adviser to the U.S.  secretary of state [title as published]:    We are encouraging forces seeking integration with the whole  world.    An extremely important event for the whole world -- that is  how Strobe Talbott, ambassador at large and special adviser to  the U.S. secretary of state on the new independents states,  described U.S. President Bill Clinton's forthcoming visit to  Moscow.    Answering journalists' questions during a TV linkup  organized  by the USIA, he noted that during this visit President Clinton  will confirm that the United States "intends to firmly maintain  its leading position in the international effort to support  reform in Russia." These transformation, in S. Talbott's words,  "can be considered the most important event of the present day."    During the visit to Moscow President Clinton will also state  that "Russia must have its own powerful voice" in determining  how the "situation in the sphere of security in Europe and  Eurasia in the post-cold war period" will work out. "If Russia  continues its course of integration...and continues to pursue a  policy based on respect for neighboring states and their  sovereignty and independence it will be able to join in the  process of integration and the expansion of NATO," S. Talbott  noted. After touching on the question of the prospects of  relations with Russia, S. Talbott remarked that the Clinton  administration looks to the future with "great optimism" because  "Russia has a strong president." "President Yeltsin was and  remains the leader of the reform process," he stressed. "We are  trying," S. Talbott added, "to encourage those forces in Russia  which are actively striving to ensure that the country makes the  transition from communism to integration with the rest of the  world."</p>

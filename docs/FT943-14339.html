			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Mozer to pay Dollars 1.1m settlement Mr Paul Mozer, former bond trader at the heart of the 1991 scandal that rocked the Wall Street firm of Salomon Brothers, has agreed to pay Dollars 1.1m (Pounds 703,000) to settle government charges that while at Salomon he submitted false bids in auctions of Treasury securities, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. He is also permanently barred from securities trading. The settlement is the final chapter in a three-year saga which began when Salomon admitted its bond trading desk had faked customers' bids in Treasury auctions to bypass restrictions on the amount of new government bonds firms were allowed to buy at auction. Mr Mozer, who ran Salomon's government bond trading desk at the time, was sentenced last year to four months in prison and fined Dollars 30,000.</p>

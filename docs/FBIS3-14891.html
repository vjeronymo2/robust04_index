			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [N. Gavrileva report on news conference given by President </F> of Crimea Yuriy Meshkov with unidentified correspondents; place  and date not given: "Edict No. 1 Is Not Yet Ready"]    [Text] The second news conference of the president of  Crimea was held after his visits to Kiev and Moscow. Because Yu.  Meshkov had granted KRYMSKAYA PRAVDA a lengthy interview on his  working trip to Russia, there were few questions on this subject  from the assembled journalists.    [Question] I would like, all the same, to get an answer from  you: What are the main results of the visit?    [Meshkov] That to which we had aspired for several years was  accomplished: preservation of the unity of the economy of the  Republic of Crimea and Russia. All our problems met with the  requisite understanding and the maximum possible support, and  preliminary agreements were reached, and all that remains is to  implement them. The main thing is that we are switching from  declarations to action. I believe that we will all perceive the  results of this switch very soon. The Republic of Crimea enjoys  most favored nation status in Russia.    For example, specialists of the former Fourth Administration  are prepared to supply the necessary equipment and make  specialists available for medical treatment, primarily of  children. I hope that they will be here next week to train our  medical personnel on the spot.    [Question] Does the invitation to Ye. Saburov to take the  office of vice premier indicate that you do not have your own  team?    [Meshkov] Issues need to be decided to the maximum benefit  of  the Republic of Crimea. Appointing this person to this office is  of the maximum benefit today.    [Question] And what will this "march from the Varangians to  the Greeks" cost Crimea?    [Meshkov] A purely symbolic amount inasmuch as he is  bringing  everything necessary with him.    [Question] What will the directions of the economic reforms  in Crimea be?    [Meshkov] The traditional ones--an equalization of the  system  of civil legislation in order that there be a legal foundation  for the unity of our economies. We cannot ignore the processes  already under way in Russia and which will necessarily take  place in Ukraine.    [Question] What kind of mechanisms will be engaged for  introducing the ruble in Crimea, and will it be introduced  before summer?    [Meshkov] The problem of the use of the ruble in Crimea has  preliminarily already been resolved, and the techniques and  procedures will be determined later. It is vitally important  that the matter be resolved before the start of the resort  season.    [Question] What was Russia's attitude toward the request for  the allocation of money for the program of the return of the  Crimean Tatars?    [Meshkov] The application was accepted, and I know that  there  is the most heavyweight resolution possible in Russia. Actual  names? We should best wait for the specific results.    [Question] People say: "A friendly calf suckles two  mothers."  May it be considered, following your visit to Moscow, that we  have opted for one "mother"? Will we not lose out--after all,  Clinton has promised Ukraine sizable assistance.    [Meshkov] I do not know whether the word "friendly" is  compatible with the image that journalists have created for me.  Ties only to Russia? Russia looks most favorably both on Crimea  in general and on a solution of questions of the Crimean economy  in particular, which, unfortunately, cannot yet be said of the  persons who represent the Ukrainian economy, if there still is  such. But this does not mean a demonstrative severance of  economic ties to Ukraine; on the contrary, we will have more  opportunities for expanding them.    [Question] Did you notify the president of Ukraine in any  form of the trip to Moscow?    [Meshkov] No. It was a working visit for the resolution of  specific economic problems--this did not go beyond the framework  of pure economics, and for this reason I shall not be reporting  on the work that was done to the president of Ukraine.    [Question] When will your apparatus be formed, and who will  be a part of it?    [Meshkov] We have abandoned the word "apparatus," we prefer  to speak of an "administration." Our principle is minimum  composition with maximum professionalism. It now consists of two  professors and the same number of generals--each a specialist in  his own field. The comments in respect to the contacts that have  been made by employees of the administration outside of Crimea  have been more than positive. There have already been comments  at the international level also.    We are taking the path of a minimum number of employees and  maximum provision with energy and accounting equipment. Problems  of communications and accounting equipment have been resolved  with Russia, and this will signify unilateral assistance to the  Republic of Crimea free of charge. Salaries are more than  modest, and I tell each member of staff that they will lose out  financially by switching to the administration.    [Question] There are rumors in Crimea concerning a new  appointment at the Crimea Television and Radio Company....    [Meshkov] It is impermissible for state structures to be  used  to propagandize one's own personal beliefs.    [Question] Explain the situation involving the black  Lincoln.    [Meshkov] [laughs] I learn about all the "movements" of the  black Lincoln from the press. There has been no conversation  with those intending to make a gift of it.    [Question] Is there a mechanism for permanent contacts with  the  Government of Russia?    [Meshkov] Yes, Crimea has been allocated... no, I shall not  say yet. The mechanism is this: Trade and economic missions of  the Russian Federation and also of its components--Krasnodar and  Stavropol Krays and Rostov-na-Donu--will be opened in Crimea,  and ours, in Russia; and also personal contacts, which were  generated at the time of the visit.    [Question] Will the administration of the president not  increase the bureaucratic machinery--and how will its appearance  affect the size of the government?    [Meshkov] I believe that this will signify a sharp reduction  in bureaucratic structures. I hope for a qualitative improvement  in work--of both the administration and the government.    [Question] GOLOS UKRAINY reported that you were received  neither by B. Yeltsin nor V. Chernomyrdin, and KOMSOMOLSKAYA  PRAVDA wrote that you were greeted in Kiev by two young persons  unknown....    [Meshkov] A meeting had been arranged, but Boris  Nikolayevich's illness prevented it taking place. The contacts  with Zhirinovskiy were not planned. In Kiev the meeting was  modest, as modest as could be; the negotiations took place in a  friendly, but official atmosphere, and tension was sensed on  both sides. Subsequently it was dispelled, and the discussion  became more specific. But it simply could not be compared with  the meeting in Moscow--in terms either of level or quality.  Heaven and earth.    [Question] You have declared repeatedly that the Republic of  Crimea will be a guarantor of a restoration of the rights of the  Crimean Tatar people. What do you understand by these words?    [Meshkov] Primarily observance of the entire volume of civil  rights that are declared and upheld by the international  community. The Republic of Crimea is responsible to its  citizens. We sought 50 billion and obtained a positive  resolution. I can confirm that the undertakings in respect to  compensation for loss must be fulfilled, but not individually  but on a legal basis.    [Question] What is your attitude toward men with shoulder  boards and their social protection? Will a committee for  servicemen be formed under the auspices of the president?    [Meshkov] Protection--to the extent that is guaranteed any  citizen of the Republic of Crimea, particularly those with  shoulder boards inasmuch as they are in the service of the  state. As for a committee, I cannot yet say; it is not, I  believe, a question of a committee but of the attitude toward  the problems of servicemen, and they are being tackled, for  example, by various structures, to which we have appealed with a  request for assistance in the construction of housing for  officers.    [Question] What kind of interaction do you have currently  with the Council of Ministers, and who was in charge of Crimea  during your week's absence?    [Meshkov] Normal, working interaction, except for the  deplorable events you witnessed following the proclamation of  the election results. I was not expecting this, to be honest.  But we have negotiated the first difficult times, and the  government has, on the whole, rendered the necessary support.  Control of the situation was not lost, and in addition all the  preliminary output of the previous negotiations in Kiev was  continued. The duties of chairman of the Council of Ministers  are being discharged--in conscientious and skilled fashion--by  A. Franchuk.    [Question] Is a reform of the local authorities--the system  of soviets--contemplated any time soon? If so, in which  direction?    [Meshkov] This question has been determined by life itself,  and it must be decided not in the plane of the elimination of  the representative bodies but in the plane of changes in their  purposes and tasks. This will mean, obviously, more professional  and fewer representatives of the populace together with the  local administration. If there are county councils in  respectable old England, they are ordained for us by God himself.    [Question] Your understanding of freedom of speech?    [Meshkov] A journalist must do his professional duty: convey  information, not express his personal viewpoint and on the  strength of this invite people who will confirm it. I am  prepared for the most impartial criticism. But what do the  newspapers attributing to a person words he has never spoken  have in common with this?    [Question] Has there been Edict No. 1, and to what is it  devoted?    [Meshkov] There is a silent competition under way in the  administration currently for the right to prepare the text of  the first edict. The team handling interethnic matters will be  the winner, it seems.    [Question] Judging by your interview in KRYMSKAYA PRAVDA,  you  are not disposed to reveal yourself completely, thereby evoking  associations with the party nomenklatura, which you so hate. Is  this an accident or a fledgling tradition?    [Meshkov] It is necessary to resort to Aesopian language in  cases where your interlocutor does not give you the right to  convey the content of the interview. At the same time it is  improper not to answer the questions of a journalist inquiring  after the content of the interview. Let us consider that this  will not become a tradition.</p>

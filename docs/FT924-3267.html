			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Zambia eases foreign exchange regulations ZAMBIA has liberalised its foreign exchange regime by merging the official and free market rates, before a meeting with donors in Paris on Friday. As a result, the official rate has been devalued 29 per cent from 248 kwacha to the dollar to K320. Before the move, announced on Monday night by the Bank of Zambia, the stronger official rate had applied to copper exports, accounting for 90 per cent of total foreign earnings, as well as to official payments abroad for debt service, fuel imports and other key imports such as fertiliser. Since the Movement for Multi Party Democracy (MMD) government was elected 13 months ago, the foreign exchange market has been substantially deregulated. Zambians can buy up to Dollars 6,000 per transaction at bureaux de change to pay for imports, service payments and foreign travel, with no limit on the number of transactions and no documentation required. The effective devaluation of the official rate will boost the domestic currency earnings of the government-owned Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines and will also have a favourable impact on government revenue. But costs and prices will be adversely affected, temporarily exacerbating inflation currently running at more than 100 per cent. Officials are confident, however, that the worst of the inflationary spiral is over and that inflation will slow to 20 per cent by the final quarter of 1993.</p>

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Peel rises 8% despite weak property market PEEL HOLDINGS, the Rochdale-based property group, reported an 8 per cent improvement in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.64m to Pounds 1.77m in the half-year to September 30. Mr John Whittaker, chairman, said demand for property was weak and rental income declined. Demand for retail warehousing had, however, remained strong. Turnover rose to Pounds 32.2m (Pounds 29.8m). Property sales amounted to Pounds 26.6m at about book value. Net rental income was Pounds 21.1m which more than covered interest charges of Pounds 19.7m. Borrowings stood at Pounds 349m, the bulk of which originated in the group's Pounds 304m takeover of London Shop in 1988. The interim dividend is held at 1p. Mr Peter Scott, managing director, said Peel increased its stake in the Manchester Ship Canal to 75.6 per cent - the second increase since the group acquired a 68 per cent interest in May 1991 - and would like to acquire the outstanding share capital, saving the group the costs and complications of maintaining two separately listed companies. He said the group had failed to agree a fair value for MSC in past talks with its minority shareholders. Valuing the company was complicated by its outstanding planning application for a 1m sq ft shopping centre at Dumplington, Manchester, likely to be resolved soon.</p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Japanese banks to issue perpetual floating-rate notes JAPANESE banks are preparing to issue perpetual floating-rate notes, despite the high cost of such instruments, in their latest effort to build up depleted capital. Yesterday's 3 per cent drop in the Nikkei stock index to just above 15,000, its lowest level since March 1986, has placed further pressure on Japanese banks, whose stock holdings count towards capital under Basle bank capital rules. Although the rules do not formally come into effect in Japan until the end of the financial year next March, banks are keen to knock their balance sheets into shape ahead of September's interim book closing. Sakura Bank (formerly Mitsui Taiyo Kobe) is preparing a Dollars 800m offering of perpetual subordinated floating-rate notes in the Eurobond market. Sakura was the sole bank among Japan's 11 commercial, or 'city', banks to fail to reach the 8 per cent capital adequacy ratio at the end of the last fiscal year. This sizeable offering is expected to pave the way for a series of similar offerings. 'There isn't a bank which isn't considering the issuance of perpetual subordinated bonds,' said Sanwa Bank, a leading commercial bank. Mr Kiichiro Ito, president of Tokai Bank, also announced that Tokai is considering issuing perpetual subordinated FRNs in late September. Many banks are in need of additional capital injections. According to IBCA, the credit rating agency, even with the Nikkei index at 16,000, Bank of Tokyo, Sakura, Nippon Credit Bank, Fuji, Tokai and Hokkaido Takushoku may already be below the 8 per cent Basle capital requirement level, while many other banks tail close behind. Bankers believe interest rates on the notes will be around 80 to 100 basis points higher than the US dollar London inter bank offered rate of around 3.8 per cent. 'For banks which can finance themselves at Libor rates, the extra cost would be over Y800m, roughly the equivalent of annual net profits at a city bank branch with 50 to 60 staff members,' said one Japanese banker. The capital raising instruments will be issued in the international markets, but are likely to be privately placed with Japanese life insurers. However, Japanese institutional investors are currently looking to limit their investments rather than expand them. The banks may be forced to turn to companies with close relationships, in some cases financing the companies which purchase the bonds. Bankers outside Japan are becoming increasingly sceptical about the methods used by Japanese banks in order to meet capital adequacy targets. 'Whether its the subordinated debt issues of a year or so ago, the recent preferred stock offerings, or these imminent perpetual floating-rate notes, (the bulk of the paper) ends up with Japanese companies within the same corporate grouping (keiretsu),' said one bank capital specialist. Analysts argue that the process of a bank lending funds to a subsidiary to buy bonds, in order to shore up its own capital, undermines the whole concept of setting minimum capital requirements on an international basis.</p>

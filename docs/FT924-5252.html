			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Looking for some light in the tunnel - The controversy surrounding Amstrad's Pounds 113m buy-back proposal AMSTRAD's 31,000 shareholders are still largely in the dark about the financial prospects for their company. That is in spite of last Tuesday's marathon four-hour annual meeting which mainly focused on Mr Alan Sugar's controversial Pounds 113m plan to buy-back the shares he does not already own. Mr Sugar, Amstrad's chairman, founder and 36 per cent shareholder, said he hoped the consumer electronics group which he built into a Pounds 625m international business in the late 1980s, would not make another loss this year, but must undergo further surgery if it was to prosper in the 1990s. Whether or not his 30p-a-share buy-back plan is approved in two weeks time, he has told shareholders that the Amstrad business, and overheads in particular, must be cut. For shareholders, the group's future prospects are a crucial factor in their decision to accept, or reject, Mr Sugar's offer. Individual and institutional investors have complained about the lack of financial forecasts in Mr Sugar's offer documents and feel there is nothing except Mr Sugar's own word to go on. 'We're being taken out at the bottom of the cycle and I just don't know what the value is,' one institutional investor complained. The Amstrad board, and Kleinwort Benson, its financial advisers, said in the offer documents that they were 'unable to present a meaningful forecast of profit or loss' because of 'the uncertainty inherent in the projections and the level of contingencies which would have to be included.' Since then the board has added that 'it is not material and would be commercially damaging to the business to disclose publicly how much shrinkage (in Amstrad) might be achieved.' But on the basis of Mr Sugar's answers to critical shareholders' questions, it is clear that his vision of Amstrad's future is very different from its past. In the 1980s Mr Sugar and Amstrad successfully identified and exploited the mass consumer market for low cost electronic systems like audio equipment, personal computers and then satellite dishes and receivers. But Mr Sugar says 'those days have gone forever,' and warns shareholders who think otherwise that they are 'dreaming.' The recession and fierce price competition has eroded margins on consumer electronics products while fashion and the fast pace of technological change means that the 'shelf-life' of a new PC, for example, has fallen from 18 months to just six months. Most crucially, Mr Sugar says he has run out of 'blockbuster' product ideas. He admits he is tired of 'fire-fighting' and does not feel comfortable running a large international group. He says now that he wants to return to what he does best - hands-on management of a fast-paced small consumer electronics trading company. Amstrad's business has already been scaled down dramatically. Turnover in the year to June 30 was Pounds 356.6m - 43 per cent below the peak 1989 level. Over the same period the number of employees has fallen from 1,647 to 743. In the meantime, Amstrad has 'cleaned out the cupboard,' writing down stocks by an average of 18 per cent and taking a Pounds 32m provision last year, split evenly between restructuring costs and inventory write-downs. Although Mr Sugar has not detailed where Amstrad will retrench, and the board has said that 'no detailed plans exist,' the only currently profitable business is satellite receivers and dishes, and Amstrad faces pressure from new entrants even in this maturing market. Amstrad's professional computer business, which represented about 40 per cent of turnover last year, is a big loss-maker because of ferocious price cutting. Some analysts reckon the PC business posted a pre-interest loss of Pounds 25m last year, and speculate that Amstrad will soon quit the business having already exited from the home computer market. Amstrad has been expanding its video equipment business and has about a 10 per cent UK market share and, more recently, its audio products segment which is, coincidently, the market Amstrad first targeted. What therefore might emerge is a domestically refocused Amstrad, still in the consumer electronics business, but with annual sales of perhaps between Pounds 120m and Pounds 150m. Although Mr Sugar has been careful not to issue any forecasts, he did sketch out a scenario at the annual meeting in which a slimmed down Amstrad produced profits of around Pounds 8m a year. Based on that scenario he predicted Amstrad would have a market capitalisation of around Pounds 65m and a share price of about 10p. He has also warned that there is little prospect of Amstrad's share price rising significantly, or the dividend increasing substantially in the near future. However, many individual shareholders still believe that his 30p-a-share offer is inadequate, especially when stacked up against the company's net asset value of 46.3p per share. The Amstrad chairman counters that the group's share price was hovering around 22p before he first mooted his offer, and no alternative bid has emerged. If his bid was matched, and offered to all shareholders, he says he would sell. The Pounds 122.2m, or 21.6p per share, of cash Amstrad had at the end of June has drawn particular interest. Even allowing for bank loans of Pounds 8.5m and finance leases of Pounds 5.7m, net cash was Pounds 108m or 19.1p per share. In addition, cash reserves should be boosted by Pounds 21m, or 4p per share, in UK corporation tax refunds which will help offset any further rationalisation costs and the Pounds 8m spent on increasing Amstrad's stake in Betacom. However, Mr Sugar argues that the group's 'core' cash, excluding seasonal fluctuations, is much lower at about Pounds 60m - equivalent to about 7p a share. And he says the 15p difference between this and the base 22p market price reflects the City's real valuation of the ongoing business and its non-cash assets. Touche Ross, Amstrad's accountants, advised Kleinwort Benson that a voluntary liquidation would be unlikely to generate proceeds 'materially in excess of 30p per share' and would probably result in shareholders receiving less than 30p. Nevertheless, there are those who agree with the dissident shareholders that Mr Sugar is trying to buy Amstrad stock 'on the cheap.' In particular, Barclays de Zoete Wedd, in its latest report on Amstrad, said the company was 'significantly undervalued at 30p' and agreed that an offer closer to net asset value 'would represent a fairer outcome.' There are other uncertainties which could also influence Amstrad's value - including the eventual outcome of legal action seeking substantial damages from two US electronics groups. Predictably, Mr Sugar is dismissive of these issues, and forcefully tells shareholders that his 30p-a-share is the most he can afford, and the most they are likely to get. The battle lines for the extraordinary meeting on December 10 have been drawn.</p>

			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ARMY, PLANNING A BIG SUMMER TRIP, STOCKS UP ON SUPPLIES AT LOCAL K MART  </P> <P> The Army went on a shopping spree at the Hinesville K mart last week and got a  blue-light special on more than 24,000 items.  </P> <P> K mart Manager Wesley Bennefield said officials at Ft.  </P> <P> Stewart, which began sending troops and equipment to Saudi Arabia over the  weekend, telephoned him Friday to order items essential for the desert: 2,400  cans of bug spray, 5,550 bottles of skin lotion, 5,550 tubes of lip balm, 5,550  containers of foot powder and 5,550 bottles of suntan lotion.  </P> <P> "This has been a real treat. I've spent three days on the telephone," said  Bennefield, who had most of the items shipped to the base Sunday night from K  mart's Atlanta warehouse.  </P> <P> The Army also ordered an item the local K mart doesn't carry: 174,000 gallons  of bottled water. Bennefield said he had rounded up 84,000 gallons from  bottled-water companies as of this morning and was trying to find the rest.  </P></p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Financial Futures and Options (6): Diversification is the spur - UK fund managers are looking again at derivatives UK INVESTMENT managers have been slow to turn to futures and options markets, preferring to rely on traditional skills such as stock-picking. Although their portfolios continue to be dominated by UK shares, increasing diversification is encouraging fund managers to look again at the benefits of derivative products. Banks are addressing, with some vigour, the task of converting UK investment managers, a largely untapped investor base. Some barriers have been removed. Most important, fund managers' tax position was clarified in the 1990 budget. 'Taxation is no longer an issue,' according to Mr Clive Gilchrist, chairman of the National Association of Pension Fund's Investment Committee. There has been progress on other issues, such as performance measurement. A recent set of recommendations for the reporting of financial futures and options in investment portfolios, published by the London International Financial Futures Exchange and Bacon &amp; Woodrow, the actuaries, is expected to create an industry standard for the first time. These guidelines should also help fund managers to clear another hurdle: trustee approval. But once trustees are satisfied that the use of derivative products is judicious, trust deeds may still need to be altered. There are less tangible obstacles. Many analysts believe the structure of the fund management industry has not favoured the development of derivative strategies. A fund manager's performance is generally measured against other fund managers' or against an index. 'The fear of doing worse than their competitors is generally stronger than the desire to do better,' according to one derivative specialist, who believes the greatest catalyst for change will be an extremely strong performance by fund managers using derivatives. For most fund managers, derivatives are an investment tool and not a distinct asset class. This use of derivative products falls under the concept of efficient portfolio management, under Securities and Investment Board rules. While futures and options can be used for a variety of purposes - to hedge exposure (for example, to reduce potential losses on a cash holding of stocks) or to pick stocks - it is the application of derivative techniques to asset allocation that has captured the attention of UK fund managers. The opening of many more foreign markets and the increasing level of international trading is causing a change in fund management techniques. Many fund managers have found that traditional skills of stock-picking are less relevant than the identification of broader market trends - for example, the difference in performance between US stocks and Japanese stocks tends to be far greater than between ICI and Hanson shares. However, to buy and sell large holdings of stocks or bonds can be both time-consuming and expensive. It is often cheaper and more efficient to shift exposure by, for example, buying FT-SE index future contracts and holding a cash deposit, so creating a synthetic equity asset. The growing use of derivative products by fund management groups is still limited largely to institutional funds. According to a new survey by KPMG Management Consulting, five out of 10 top pension fund organisations use futures and options in more than 25 per cent of their funds - a substantial increase on last year, when eight out of the 10 funds surveyed used futures and options in only 25 per cent or less of funds managed. In addition, the way has now been cleared for retail investors to buy unit trusts which use futures and options. Last July, the Securities and Investments Board opened the door for authorised unit trusts to invest in futures and options through two new types of fund: futures and options funds (FOFs) and geared futures and options funds (GFOFs). FOFs can invest up to 10 per cent of their assets in derivative products, while 20 per cent of assets in GFOFs can be in futures and options which do not have to be covered. So far, only two companies have taken advantage of the new rules and launched funds, although about 10 are believed to be awaiting authorisation. The first funds, launched by John Govett, have so far made sales of over Pounds 30m through financial intermediaries. However, these funds are targeted at 'the top end of the UK market', according to director Adam Parkin. The only genuine retail product launched to date has been Legal &amp; General's UK Tactical Allocation Trust, which has raised around Pounds 5m so far. Prudential, which cancelled earlier plans to launch FOFs, due to adverse reaction, is 'still working towards the launch of one or more derivative-based funds', according to Mr Alan Wren, managing director. So far these funds are available only in the UK. But the Joint Exchanges Committee is lobbying to have the Ucits directive extended, so that such funds are given an EC passport. Such a move is still some way off, however. Meanwhile, another branch of the industry is developing: offshore futures funds. Unlike the pension-fund industry, managed futures funds treat derivative products as a distinct asset class, often using quantitative techniques. The industry had experienced massive growth in the US during the 1980s, to around Dollars 20bn. A budding European offshore futures fund industry is estimated to have reached only Dollars 2bn. Moreover, most of the actual investment management is still done out of the US, where experts known as CTAs (commodity trading advisers) are based. However, some specialist firms, such as Rudolf Wolff and Sabre, are fostering home-grown talent. Some large banks, including Citibank, are also marketing managed futures in Europe. A gradual shift is under way in the UK fund management industry. Some very large institutions, including Prudential, the British Rail pension fund and Postel, openly declare their use of derivative products. Some fund managers believe that economic conditions will create an added impetus. They suggest that fund managers have been spoilt by high returns in recent years and that, with returns set to fall, the argument for using derivative products to enhance returns will become more compelling. However, conversion of UK fund managers, who still hold the vast bulk of their assets in UK stocks, will not be a speedy process.</p>

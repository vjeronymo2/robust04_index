			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kim Song-kil] </F>   [Text] Lawmakers are paying extra attention to the  restructuring of committees during the second-half of the  National Assembly, particularly the newly formed Intelligence  Committee.    The first question is to what extent can the National  Assembly Intelligence Committee control the Agency for National  Security Planning [NSP]. The means for the National Assembly to  control administrative departments are through budget and policy  review for legislation. Unlike in the past, the National  Assembly is known to have considerable, although not complete,  control.    The NSP will submit to the Intelligence Committee all  detailed data required for actual review of all budgets. This  means that, from now on, the NSP will be on the National  Assembly's review list as far as the budget is concerned. In  the past, the NSP only reported to the National Assembly the  total amount of NSP expenses and intelligence costs without any  supporting documentation and thus, passed National Assembly  review without disclosing any details. The Intelligence  Committee budget review will not be open to the public, and only  the total amount of the budget will be reported to the speaker  and notified to the Budget Committee.    The NSP director could still refuse to answer questions in  the National Assembly but, unlike in the past, will be preceded  by the notification that the issue is critical to national  security.    The position of the Democratic Liberal Party [DLP], however,  is that the committee should refrain from questioning concrete  matters of the department because they are state secrets. This  is why the committee members have dual memberships. The DLP  asserts that pending issues should be discussed by the National  Assembly as the Intelligence Committee is banned from leaking  secrets. Hence, considerable disagreement is expected between  the ruling and opposition parties regarding the management of  the Intelligence Committee.    Another matter of interest is the structure of the  Intelligence Committee.    Since the members have to deal with state secrets, important  post holders of the Democratic faction, including the Chairman  of the Defense Committee Sin Sang-u (six-time elected) and  former DLP Secretary General Hwang Myong-su (four-time elected)  are possible candidates to chair the Intelligence Committee.    As agreed during the last floor-leader meeting between the  ruling and opposition parties, 12 DLP and five Democratic Party  lawmakers will be assigned to the committee.    The members should belong to a negotiation group and the  floor leaders of the ruling and opposition parties will have  positions. Members should include those from the six standing  committees, including the Operation, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs  and Unification, Home Affairs, Defense, and Administration and  Economic Committees.    Such limitations on the qualification of the committee  members is due to the confidentiality of the committee  activities.</p>

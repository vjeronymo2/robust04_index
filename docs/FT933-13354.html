			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Whips turn heat on Tory rebels HARDLINE TORY Euro-sceptics were yesterday under mounting pressure not to vote with Labour in the first of Thursday's votes on Maastricht's social chapter as the government turned up the heat in its efforts to stave off defeat. But it appeared last night that more than enough sceptics were prepared to support Labour's amendment backing the social chapter - or to abstain - to overturn the government's 18-strong majority. If they stick to this position ministers would be forced into a deal with one or more of the opposition parties - probably the Ulster Unionists - to salvage a chance of victory. If the Unionists vote with the government, the number of rebels needed to carry the Labour amendment would rise to 19. If the Unionists abstain, 14 Tory rebels would be enough to defeat the government. Pressure was last night being brought to bear on the Euro-sceptic hardliners from at least three different directions: constituency associations, government business managers and even some fellow Euro-sceptics. Mr Michael Carttiss, the Tory MP for Great Yarmouth who frequently defied government whips during the Maastricht bill's Commons committee stage, said last night: 'I have argued with one or two (Euro-sceptics) in the last week and they were firm that by voting for the Labour amendment they would stymie the treaty.' Mr Carttiss said it was beyond his comprehension how Euro-sceptics could consider supporting the social chapter. Hardline sceptics meanwhile emerged tight-lipped from a 'secret' afternoon meeting. 'We want to keep our powder dry,' said one. In a further indication that the government is taking no chances in its battle for ratification, the whips yesterday circulated a letter to backbenchers asking for full details of their whereabouts during the summer recess.</p>

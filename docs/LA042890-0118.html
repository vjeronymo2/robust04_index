			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FILE  </P> <P> Los Angeles Catholic Archbishop Roger M. Mahony has banned a Filipino  devotional movement from using archdiocesan facilities after a study committee  said the sectarian group, led by a woman who says God speaks through her, had  refused to conform to Catholic teachings.  </P> <P> The Banal na Pag-Aaral (BNP) movement -- already banned in Manila by  CardinalJaime Sin and in San Francisco by Archbishop John Quinn -- is believed  to have at least 5,000 members within the Filipino Catholic population of  425,000 in the Los Angeles archdiocese.  </P> <P> A study committee headed by Bishop-elect Stephen E. Blaire, moderator of the  archdiocesan curia, issued a statement that Catholics "should be warned that  the BNP is not a Roman Catholic organization in any sense of the word," but  that it had given "the false impression" that it was.  </P> <P> Some priests in the archdiocese had heard confessions and celebrated Masses at  the movement's intensive weekend retreats, but they now have been ordered to  disassociate themselves from the BNP.  </P> <P> Blaire said in an interview that the group is led by Salve Carreon, who founded  the group in the Philippines and later moved to the San Gabriel Valley.  Attempts to reach a spokesman for reaction from the group were unsuccessful.  </P> <P> Blaire said that in re-enactments of the Last Supper during the retreats,  Carreon has dressed as Christ and blessed bread and wine served to candidates  for membership.  </P> <P> The study committee said that claims by BNP members to have witnessed  levitation, the ability to "read hearts" and other supernatural phenomena can  be attributed to the atmosphere created at the retreats. "Music, lighting, lack  of sleep and endless hours of lectures create a mixture of expectation and  terror in the participants," the committee said.  </P> <P> The Filipino Catholic community, second in size among immigrant ethnic groups  in the archdiocese only to the Mexican Catholic immigrant population, has a  high proportion of educated, multilingual believers, according to a report last  year to the Archdiocesan Pastoral Council by Rose Valencia, an official of the  Filipino Catholic ministry.  </P> <P> But she also cautioned, without singling out BNP or other groups, that many  Filipino Catholics may remain on the periphery of parish life in this country.  "If Filipinos are not affirmed in their own unique faith expressions, they tend  to form home-based churches outside the parishes," Valencia said. "Usually  these groups are under the influence of very charismatic leaders."  </P> <P> </P> <P> LITHUANIA  </P> <P> Bishop Jack M. Tuell of Los Angeles, writing April 6 as president of the United  Methodist Council of Bishops, commended President Bush for his "sensitive  restraint" dealing with Lithuania's March 11 declaration of independence from  the Soviet Union. Tuell wrote: "We recognize with you the legitimate desire of  the Lithuanian people for independence, and are grateful for your support of  that principle. But we also recognize how dangerous the situation is in the  Soviet Union, and that adopting confrontational tactics or laying down  ultimatums could severely damage the emerging possibilities of peace in the  world." Bush announced Tuesday after consultation with Congress and U.S. allies  that he would not impose sanctions on the Soviet Union, which has imposed some  economic blockades on the republic.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CONVENTION  </P> <P> The National Federation of Priests' Councils, once a feisty challenger to U.S.  Catholic bishops that preferred to run their dioceses without unsolicited  advice, will convene next week at Universal City in a much more mellow frame of  mind. Twenty years ago, the fledgling organization of priests' senates and  unauthorized associations held their national meeting in San Diego to discuss  the then-provocative theme of "shared responsibility." The idea of priests'  advisory councils gradually gained favor in the Roman Catholic Church, however,  and is now mandated by canon law for every diocese. At last year's convention,  delegates voted not to pass resolutions in future conventions. The five-day  convention at the Sheraton Universal opens Monday night.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NOMINEES  </P> <P> The six-county Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles announced this week that it  will present seven nominees at a special convention to elect a suffragan, or  auxiliary bishop, to succeed Bishop Oliver B. Garver Jr., who retires this  summer. The only local nominee is the Rev. Canon D. Bruce MacPherson, an  assistant to Bishop Frederick H. Borsch. The election will be held June 9 at  St. Vincent de Paul Roman Catholic Church in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DATES  </P> <P> Actor Walter Matthau will host a musical program at Beverly Hills Presbyterian  Church at 4 p.m. Sunday that includes "Study for Strings," written by Pavel  Haas during World War II in Theresienstadt, Adolf Hitler's "model"  concentration camp for Jewish musicians and composers. Conductor Nick Strimple  said the piece was first performed as part of a propaganda film featuring the  camp's string orchestra. Just after the first live performance of the work in  the summer of 1944, transports took away most of the orchestra members to  Auschwitz, where only a handful survived. Strimple said the piece has been  performed five other times but never in the United States. JOHN DART  </P></p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: BBA restructures management BBA, the engineering and motor components group, yesterday unveiled a new management structure aimed at returning the company to profit. For the year to December 31 BBA swung from profits of Pounds 47.4m to pre-tax losses of Pounds 12.8m. The diversified group has reorganised its businesses into three divisions comprising automotive activities, aviation services in the US, and a single industrial and engineering unit. The scheme has been implemented by Mr Roberto Quarta, chief executive, in an attempt to refocus the company on core activities and to identify peripheral activities for disposal. In the 12 months to end-December, that strategy contributed to a Pounds 17.8m exceptional loss on plant closures and disposals - most notably on the closure of its friction materials plant in Belgium. The group also wrote off a Pounds 3.8m investment in United Industries, the precision tools and springs manufacturer, in which it has a 21.23 per cent stake. The exceptional provisions were offset only by an Pounds 18.4m gain on the sale of Pacific BBA, its partly owned Australian subsidiary. Mr Peter Clappison, finance director, said the disposals - including the Pounds 25m sale of three business since the year end - were part of an on-going restructuring programme which would enable BBA to exploit any revival in its core businesses. He warned, however, that there were few signs that such a revival was underway. In the automotive division, for example, operating profits fell to Pounds 21.5m (Pounds 37.6m) on sales down 7.6 per cent at Pounds 574.1m. 'There's been extreme price pressure in continental Europe, and we anticipate a further 10 per decline in volume output next year,' Mr Clappison added. Profit margins in the division fell to 1.5 per cent in the second half of last year, compared with 5.6 per cent in the same period of 1992. Initial signs, meanwhile, of a recovery in the aviation business were undermined by 'extreme overcapacity and reduced demand in the US airline maintenance market'. Its second half margins also fell sharply, down to 1.6 per cent from 4.2 per cent in the last six months of 1992. The performance of the two divisions was offset by an improvement in the industrial and engineering division, which enjoyed a 42 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 55.3m.</p>

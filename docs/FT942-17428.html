			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Representative selection  -Exporting / Rules for UK companies choosing agents in overseas markets Since the new European Union law on agencies came into effectlate last year, UK companies wanting to export must take far greater care in choosing who will represent them abroad. While most European companies will notice no difference as they have had well-defined contracts with agents for many years, the changes have come as a shock to their more cavalier British counterparts. No longer will UK exporters be able to engage and then drop Continental agents, safe in the knowledge that most will not challenge them in a British court and under common law. Since January 1, UK exporters have become subject to European law which implements a 1986 directive that clearly defines the framework of agency agreements and gives agents well-prescribed rights. Mike Thornton, partner in Laytons, the Manchester solicitors, says that some UK exporters were so concerned about the changes that many agency agreements were torn up before the deadline, with exporters either turning to distribution agreements or bringing their representatives in house as full-time employees. 'I keep impressing on people to spend a few shillings in the beginning drawing up an agreement and save a fortune in court costs later,' says Thornton. 'Historically, British companies have written their agency agreements on the back of a fag packet.' As with all decisions about starting to export, the choice of whether to go with an agent, a distributor, a joint venture or to set up a local office requires careful planning. The last two options suggest the exporter has a high degree of confidence in the product and deep pockets to support the decision. But choosing between the agency or distribution route depends largely on the product, the type of market and local custom. The technical difference between a distributor and an agent is that the former buys the goods from the supplier, holds the goods on account and makes its profits by marking up the price. An agent, on the other hand, generally works with his principal's price list and does not take title to goods. Under the new EU agency law, an agent has the right to inspect such extracts of the principal's books as are necessary to check commission levels. The agent also has a right to compensation if there is early termination of an agreement. 'You can end agency agreements,' says Thornton, 'but you are no longer able to have an agreement so much in favour of the principal.' In most European countries, the exporter of expensive items will require an agent - few distributors will be prepared to fund stocks of big ticket items. For faster moving items, the distributor route is more suitable through most of Europe - although in Italy agency networks and the idea of the middle man are well established. A distributor is also more appropriate for companies supplying machinery needing maintenance and service support. David Hammond, managing director of Hertfordhire-based consultancy Aimm, says agencies are a good route for businesses that want to dip their toe in an export market. A distributor, on the other hand, gives a supplier a far more dedicated service in return for which the supplier will have to commit to a level of financial support and agreed production levels. For many first-time exporters the first port of call should be the country desk of the Department of Trade and Industry, which will put the business in touch with relevant commercial consulates.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Kalmykov: "The Government Is Looking for </F> Money; but the Metro Has Already Found It in the Pockets of the  Passengers"]    [Text]  <H5>  The Mayoralty </H5>   It finally became clear yesterday that the city budget  deficit for next year will be a minimum of 1.5 trillion rubles  [R]. Prim Minister Yuriy Luzhkov insisted upon this figure  despite the fact that it will require a substantial reduction in  the expenditures of the government of Moscow next year--the  draft of the budget, which takes into account the needs of the  city in a maximum way, has a deficit of more than R7 trillion.    At a regular meeting, the Moscow government in the course of  three and a half hours tried to find ways to cut the deficit.  For this, priority expenditure articles that constituted the  so-called protected group of expenditures and articles that were  subject to reduction were determined. The government assigned  social programs, the housing construction program, energy  support for the city, the collection and processing of garbage,  and also the reconstruction of the center of the capital to the  "protected" group.    A reduction of the expenditures part, even by a total of 100  percent, will not bring the desired results, inasmuch as just  the "protected" programs require more than R16 trillion, but the  expected incomes of the city treasury are limited to R14  trillion. Therefore, the department of finance put forth several  proposals to increase budget revenues. In particular, it was  proposed to transfer housing construction projects to investors,  and not to finance them directly. Moreover, the Moscow  government intends to "extract" R2.5 trillion from the federal  pocket in the form of subventions, "regardless of whether they  are there or not."    Speaking at the meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Boris  Nikolskiy reported that in view of the reduction in outlays for  the renewal of the rolling stock of the city's transport, there  will be a significant increase in fares next year. Starting on 1  January, a Metro trip will cost Muscovites and guests of the  capital R50, and an even more substantial increase in fares on  city transport is expected by the end of the year--up to R160,  and on the Metro--up to R200.</p>

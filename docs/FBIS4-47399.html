Akifyev, Institute of Chemical Physics </F> imeni N.N. Semenov, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow; UDC 575]    [Abstract] Only 7-10% of the DNA in the human genome  represents structural genes, regulatory sequences, origins of  replication, sequences bound to the nuclear matrix and  P-repeats. A theory is proposed that this DNA be regarded as  basic genome of the eukaryotic cells. The reason for the excess  DNA present in the eukaryotic genome remains enigmatic, but one  answer may be that it provides a critical chromatin mass  necessary to maintain the structural organization and  macromolecular framework for successful mitosis or meiosis.  Studies on the human genome could be considerable facilitated  and reduced in cost if such efforts were to be solely directed  at the basic genome, excluding the non-basic genome from the  sequencing efforts.

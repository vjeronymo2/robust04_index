And he  said that once the frame of reference of such mediation had been  set, he would personally be willing to start campaigning for an  election. The IFP Central Committee would decide on Friday  whether the party should provisionally register before the  Friday midnight deadline for the April election.    Addressing journalists and businessmen in Cape Town, Mr  Buthelezi said he had "come to the end" of the current  constitutional road. "Only this international mediation might  open a new chapter," he said in answer to a question at a press  conference after he had addressed the Cape Town Chamber of  Commerce.    Mr Buthelezi revealed that the Freedom Alliance had, at a  meeting in Cape Town earlier on Thursday, accepted international  mediation in principle to resolve South Africa' constitutional  deadlock. He told the business luncheon -- at which he had  arrived about an hour late because of the Alliance meeting --  that he had "just been told" that the African National Congress  [ANC] working committee had also decided in principle there  should be international mediation.    Mr Buthelezi and ANC President Nelson Mandela agreed in a  joint statement after meeting in Durban on Tuesday that the  possibility of international mediation should be explored to  resolve outstanding constitutional deadlocks. Mr Buthelezi told  the businessmen on Thursday that the interim constitution, as it  stood, would give rise to the politics of violent recrimination  when it was found that "it polarises South Africa and destroys  the prospects of producing the national unity in which there  will emerge the national will to establish a democracy and make  it work".</p>

			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPANESE-AMERICANS: A WRONG ISN'T RIGHTED IF THE PROMISE IS BROKEN  </P> <P> Last year, Congress sought to redress one of the most egregious wrongs in our  nation's history. This year, it seems, the market for such noble aspirations  has fallen.  </P> <P> The Civil Liberties Act of 1988, signed into law by President Reagan one year  ago this week, acknowledged that the World War II incarceration of loyal  Americans of Japanese ancestry was motivated by "racial prejudice, wartime  hysteria and a failure of political leadership." The legislation recognized the  "fundamental injustice of the evacuation, relocation and internment,"  apologized "on behalf of the people of the United States," and authorized  restitution. Of the 120,000 Japanese Americans who were shipped off to desert  barracks solely because of their race, about half had died when the bill was  signed. Only those internees alive as of the date of enactment are eligible to  receive the $20,000 compensation provided in the law.  </P> <P> One year after the law's passage, not a dollar of reparations has been paid.  Congress did not fund redress payments for 1989. No funds have been  appropriated yet for 1990. The figure that one House committee recently  recommended is so trivial as to recall the internment decision itself: a  betrayal of the government's promise, and again, a failure of political  leadership.  </P> <P> As deplorable as the relocation of Japanese Americans was, one can argue that  the hysteria of war and pressure from organized racists distorted the judgment  of our democratic institutions. There are no excuses for today's pathetic  situation. Congress is authorized to appropriate $500 million in redress for  1990. To compensate just those survivors over the age of 70 -- a target  Congress set in this year's budget -- would take $350 million. The House  Appropriations Committee has recommended $50 million. That is one-half of what  President Bush just promised to private businesses in Poland. Compared to the  stealth bomber and the savings-and-loan bailout, of course, it is pocket  change.  </P> <P> The Civil Liberties Act is a strong and sweeping declaration of America's  commitment to justice. Its passage was remarkable because the 60,000 surviving  internees are not a powerful special interest. Lawyers and lobbyists did not  win redress. The long, grass-roots efforts of the Japanese-American community  to confront its 40 years of sorrow and anger, and to persuade Congress to  redress this historical outrage, yielded an extraordinary, if long-delayed,  victory of constitutional healing. The remedial effects benefit more than the  concentration camp survivors. The law recognizes that individual freedoms  restrict government action even during war. Among the legislation's purposes  are to discourage similar injustices in the future and "make more credible"  U.S. statements of concern over other nations' human-rights violations.  </P> <P> Today, as countries around the world struggle with their pasts in order to  bring change, America's commitment to remedy this sorry chapter can increase  credibility that has been in short supply. The question now is whether this  commitment will be fulfilled.  </P> <P> Since the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 was passed, more than 2,000 Japanese  American concentration camp survivors have died. Some were veterans who, on  returning from battle on behalf of the United States, had to visit their  families behind barbed wire. Some were mothers who had lost sons in the war.  All had lost their property, their freedom and their dignity. Without full  funding of redress payments, many more will be denied their government's  recognition of the injustice inflicted upon them.  </P> <P> Our commitment to justice -- and to these survivors -- must not rise in an  election year and fall when the debt comes due. If the grudging funding levels  now being proposed are adopted, Congress and the Administration will have  failed to heed the Civil Liberties Act's purposes and broken its promise.  </P></p>

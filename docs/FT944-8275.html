			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Observer: Tate and smile Isn't it lucky that charities are duty bound to have charitable thoughts? Otherwise some of them might be cursing the Tate gallery come Budget day. It seems that Customs &amp; Excise is determined that the Tate should cough up Pounds 12m in value added tax which will be due on the conversion costs of transforming the old Bankside power station into its new art gallery. The Tate, however, counts as a charity. And social welfare charities and worthy bodies - such as nursing homes - are hoping the Budget will include them in the zero-VAT rate on converting commercial buildings into housing. Current betting is that the worthies will win and the charities lose - and all because Customs just can't bear to see that Pounds 12m slipping from its grasp. Result: if Eton wanted to convert a warehouse into a boarding house it could get VAT relief; if a local charity wanted to convert the same building to a day centre for the elderly it couldn't.</p>

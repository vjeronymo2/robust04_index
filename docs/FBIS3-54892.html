			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev -- White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers  has announced that the U.S. President will begin his "European"  tour on 9 January. Bill Clinton will take part in a conference  of NATO member countries' heads of state and government and from  11 to 12 January will visit Prague where he will hold  negotiations with Polish, Hungarian, Slovak, and Czech leaders.  At Boris Yeltsin's invitation, the American President will make  a three-day official visit to Moscow to "consolidate the  democratic partnership between the United States and Russia," it  officially reported. To conclude his tour, Clinton will visit  Minsk.    Ukraine will not be visited by the head of the White House.  However, INTERFAX reported on 3 January that a visit by L.  Kravchuk to Moscow for trilateral negotiations has not been  ruled out and that the Ukrainian president has been invited to  do so in a recent letter from Clinton. The president's  international service has informed a UNIAN correspondent that  Nursultan Nazarbayev will make an official visit to Ukraine  during Clinton's stay in Moscow. As for the letter, there is,  indeed, an invitation in it to a trilateral meeting, but in  Washington rather than in Moscow. It is not certain, THE  WASHINGTON POST on 3 January quoted a high-ranking  representative of the administration as saying, that the  American and Ukrainian presidents will meet in Moscow; experts  think that this will depend on the results of the U.S.-Ukrainian  nuclear talks with the participation of the Russian side, which  started in Washington on 3 January. Ukraine is represented  there by Vice Premier V. Shmarov and Deputy Foreign Minister B.  Tarasyuk.    Viktor Stelmakh, press secretary to the Ukrainian president,  informed a UNIAN correspondent on 4 January that he could  neither confirm nor deny reports of a forthcoming meeting  between Kravchuk and Clinton in Moscow, since "there has been no  final decision yet."</p>

AWB spokesman Fred Rundle said AWB leader  Eugene Terreblanche was not immediately available for comment.    Observers feared the incident could lead to acts of  retribution and increasing violence.    REUTER photographer Kevin Carter said he saw the AWB men  plead for their lives, crying "please God help us" before a  Bophuthatswana Defence Force [BDF] soldier, ignoring his  comrades protests, took aim and shot them dead. He also pumped  bullets into the dead body of a third AWB member lying next to  them.    The three AWB men had been ambushed in the centre of  Mmabatho  in their green Mercedes car.    Mr Rundle said he had received reports that five other AWB  men had been injured in other incidents.    South African security sources said the incident showed the  AWB should have employed better military tactics when they  entered Mmabatho, moving around in larger groups and using  better communications. They also said the AWB men probably did  not expect the BDF to turn on them, if this is what happened.</p>

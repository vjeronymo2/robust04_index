			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACTION ON GLOBAL WARMING URGED; NO TARGETS ARE SET  </P> <P> A U.N. conference ended Wednesday with a declaration committing governments to  a "global response" to global warming but stopping short of setting targets to  control the greenhouse gases that cause it.  </P> <P> The 30-point declaration included an appeal for an international global-warming  treaty with "real commitments" and a pledge to provide developing countries  with funds to deal with the issue.  </P> <P> The 10-day World Climate Conference, attended by representatives of 137  countries, was intended to set the stage for negotiations opening in Washington  in February on an international treaty to be ready for signing in mid-1992.  </P> <P> In a joint statement, 40 environmental groups expressed "severe disappointment"  at the outcome.  </P> <P> "In the name of 'compromise,' they failed to meet their responsibility of  committing industrial nations to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide and  other greenhouse gases," the statement said.  </P> <P> The United States, which led opposition against any target-setting, considered  the U.N. declaration a "good compromise," said its chief delegate, John Knauss.  </P> <P> Knauss said any policy decisions "must be based on the best available economic  and sociological, as well as scientific, information."  </P></p>

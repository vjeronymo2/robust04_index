			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The United Nations Collects the Toll"] </F>   [Text] If the peace process starts moving again at this  time -- first with the Palestinians, and later with Syria,  Lebanon, and Jordan -- the development, desirable as it may be,  will be taking place in the shadow of the UN Security Council  [UNSC] resolution, which Israel will find hard to digest. From  the very first moment, it was clear that the Cave of the  Patriarchs massacre would result in a harsh condemnation of  Israel. Any American effort to prevent more painful damage was  doomed to fail. The UNSC resolution portrays Israel as a  country unable to provide security for the Palestinian residents  of the occupied territories by itself. Therefore, the United  Nations demands that Israel host an international observer force  which would supervise the Israeli military government. The fact  that Jerusalem was mentioned as part of the occupied territories  reinforces the United Nations' refusal to recognize the  undivided city as Israel's capital.    The U.S. policymakers tried to prevent such a resolution;  but  other than blocking a demand that the international observer  force be armed, it scored no substantive achievement. The  procedural achievement -- holding a clause-by-clause vote --  only allowed the Americans to express their reservations over  the mention of Jerusalem. But the pressure AIPAC [American  Israel Public Affairs Committee] put on the U.S. Administration  to order its UN representative to veto the entire resolution did  not succeed. Clinton and Christopher can tell American Jewry  that they did their best to soften the blow to Israel, but the  scope of the Hebron disaster reduced their ability to do so.    The government certainly entertains no illusions about the  gravity of the U.S. failure -- which is its own failure as well.  At the same time, it is trying to find consolation in the fact  that the UNSC resolution could pave the way for the resumption  of contacts with the other peace process partners.  Nevertheless, any Israeli attempt to diminish the impact of the  resolution -- for example, restricting the number of observers  to a certain minimum -- might be dependent on concessions we  will have to make in the direct negotiations with the PLO  delegation.    Naturally, the fact that the PLO leadership agreed to  receive  the Israeli delegation and hold discussions with it, which means  the resumption of the negotiations about an early withdrawal  from Gaza and Jericho, is welcome. At the same time, Rabin will  apparently have to agree that the Tunis discussions will also  deal with the means that need to be employed to protect the  Palestinians. The qualification made last week, according to  which the issue will be discussed "in accordance with the  government's resolution," should not mislead us. We had better  not act surprised when the PLO, on whose territory the  discussions are being held, demands that all the Jewish settlers  be evacuated from Hebron.    Even if the government wishes to hold on to Qiryat Arba' for  the time being, there is no reason to expect that it will  succeed in holding on to the Jewish settlement inside Hebron by  concentrating the settlers in one or two sites instead of the  current seven. Had the government pulled them out immediately  after the massacre -- risking petitions to the High Court of  Justice and braving the opposition -- Israel could have suffered  less damage at the UNSC. At this time, there is serious doubt  whether the government will be able to avoid making the move it  had hoped to avoid while leaning on the United States. The  right-wing parties have no reason to claim that their  demonstrations influenced the government. The fact that the  belief that Israel would be able to avoid paying a price for the  Hebron massacre was mistaken is now clearly visible to all.</p>

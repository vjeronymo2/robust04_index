			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Big rise in Australia's trade gap RECORD exports offset the impact of a big rise in Australia's monthly current account deficit yesterday, helping the weak Australian dollar to resist further falls. The government said the seasonally adjusted deficit jumped to ADollars 1.5bn (Pounds 658m) in September from a revised ADollars 936m in August, adding to concerns that the 1992-93 deficit will exceed the budget forecast of ADollars 15bn. The announcement caused a short-lived sell-off of the Australian dollar, which dropped to a five-year low of 69.17 US cents in morning trading in Sydney, following a fall from 72 to just under 70 cents earlier in the week. However, the currency recovered to close at 69.58 cents after the foreign exchange market digested the detailed figures, which suggested the deterioration was not as bad as was first feared. Most of it was caused by an increase of 20 per cent in merchandise imports.</p>

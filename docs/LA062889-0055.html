			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> Elton John is set to reprise the role of the Pinball Wizard, which he played in  the 1975 film version of "Tommy," when the Who performs its rock opera at the  Universal Amphitheatre on Aug. 24. The show (which will be televised as a  pay-per-view event) also is expected to feature Robert Plant as the Hawker,  Phil Collins as Uncle Ernie and Billy Idol as the abusive Cousin Kevin. The Who  was scheduled to play "Tommy" on Tuesday at New York's Radio City Music Hall  without the all-star cast. Proceeds from both productions are being donated to  various charities and to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

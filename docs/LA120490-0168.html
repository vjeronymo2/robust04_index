Final  </P> <P> STOCKS IN TOKYO PLUMMET 4%  </P> <P> Stock prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange plummeted nearly 4% today as major  players abandoned the field to margin selling and arbitrage.  </P> <P> Trading remained light.  </P> <P> The blue-chip Nikkei Average of 225 selected issues, which gained 271.36 points  Monday, fell 863.38 points to close below the psychologically important 22,000  mark at 21,862.61.  </P> <P> But the figure many brokers pointed to was the low volume, which continued to  dwindle as an estimated 240 million shares changed hands, down from 264 million  Monday.  </P> <P> By comparison, a year ago, when the Nikkei was racing toward an all-time high,  volume on Dec. 4 was 1.2 billion shares.  </P></p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Further initiatives at Lloyd's TWO NEW initiatives designed to take advantage of the move by the Lloyd's insurance market to seek corporate investors were announced yesterday. Johnson Fry, the financial services group, opened an offer for subscription for its Corporate Insurance Recovery Trust, which will invest in the shares of other Lloyd's investment companies. It aims to raise between Pounds 15m and Pounds 50m. The latest date for applications is November 2, with dealings beginning on November 8. Minimum subscription is Pounds 3,000. Hill Samuel, the merchant bank, is joining forces with Panmure Gordon, the stockbroker, and RF Kershaw, the members' agent, to raise Pounds 50m for the Delian Lloyd's Investment Trust. The portfolio will be managed by Foreign &amp; Colonial Management. The two deals are the latest in a string of initiatives. Late last week Rafael Zorn Hemsley, the stockbroker, announced its intention to raise Pounds 30m through Syndicate Capital Trust. John Govett will manage the funds, while a new company, Insurance Analysis, will advise the trust on participations in 17 syndicates. Peel Hunt, the stockbroker is sponsoring Corporate Membership, a company formed by two Names, Mr Donald Green and Mr Anthony Hamilton, which aims to raise between Pounds 8m and Pounds 20m in capital. Separately, the Hiscox Select Insurance Fund, backed by Roberts &amp; Hiscox, the members' agency, and Charterhouse Tilney, the securities house, last week issued its pathfinder prospectus. Hiscox aims to raise Pounds 28.9m from a placing and will provide Pounds 50m of capacity to approximately 70 syndicates. Decisions to go ahead with all the schemes are dependent on a vote in favour of the corporate capital initiative at tomorrow's extraordinary meeting of Lloyd's.</p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SAN FERNANDO CLINCHES TITLE IN WEST VALLEY  </P> <P> Rightly or not, El Camino Real High felt it had nothing to lose.  </P> <P> San Fernando, which wasn't supposed to falter, had plenty to lose.  </P> <P> "They beat us bad the first time and they're awfully good," said El Camino Real  Coach Mike McNulty, explaining his team's carefree attitude Friday afternoon  before the West Valley League finale between two playoff-bound teams. The  Tigers had pounded the Conquistadores by 20 points in their first meeting.  </P> <P> But the winner of the game at San Fernando on Friday would be league champ and  would take the better seeding into the playoffs next week. So whom to take?  </P> <P> The favorite, of course: San Fernando (17-7, 7-3) emerged with a 67-61 win to  give Coach Dick Crowell his second league title in three years and secure a  date with Marshall in the first round of the playoffs. El Camino Real (9-10,  6-4) finished in second place and will face East Valley League champion Grant.  </P> <P> Simple? Not really.  </P> <P> San Fernando used its decided height and weight advantages inside -- Russell  Baldwin (team-high 17 points) and 6-foot-8, 250-pound Lance Whitaker (16  points) -- to hammer out a cushy 57-42 lead with 40 seconds remaining in the  third quarter. Then a funny thing happened.  </P> <P> Conquistadore guard Todd Orlando (game-high 20 points) drilled five three-point  shots in the second half, the Tigers played as if sedated, and suddenly the  scoreboard read 61-59, San Fernando, with just 3 minutes 55 seconds left.  </P> <P> El Camino Real effectively used substitutes Al Chow and Danny Costa and starter  Brent Goldberg during its magical 14-2 run in the fourth quarter. Then it shot  itself in the foot, however, by missing four consecutive free throws.  </P></p>

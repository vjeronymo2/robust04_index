			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up - Bahamas The Bahamas aims to launch a stock exchange in 1995 with assistance from the Inter-American Development Bank, Reuter reports. The IADB said that the long-term intention was to harmonise the existing four Caribbean stock exchanges, and nine others in Central America. The Bahamas exchange would join ones already operating in Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad and the Dominican Republic. Some 10 to 12 government enterprises are expected to be privatised in the coming months in the Bahamas. The former British colony is one of the world's largest offshore banking centres.

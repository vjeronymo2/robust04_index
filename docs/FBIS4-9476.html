			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, April 25 (CTK) -- Slovak Premier Jozef  Moravcik will probably not take part in an international  conference on liberalism in Central and East Europe, being  organized by the Friedrich Naumann Foundation this Saturday in  the Hungarian town of Visegrad, Gergely Prolle from the  foundation told CTK today.    Moravcik has been invited to attend the conference both by  the foundation and leading representatives of two Hungarian  liberal parties -- the Union of Free Democrats and the Union of  Young Democrats.    Prolle said that Moravcik had excused himself, citing the  lack of time, already last Friday. On the other hand in an  interview with representatives of Hungarian liberal parties in  Bratislava Moravcik has allegedly made it clear that he would  attend the Visegrad meeting of Central European liberal  politicians if possible.    Liberal politicians and representatives of liberal parties  from all Central European countries and some Western politicians  are to take part in the conference. It is expected that  Chairman of the Liberal International Otto Lambsdorff will also  take part. Representatives of some liberal parties from the  Czech Republic have also been invited, organizers said.</p>

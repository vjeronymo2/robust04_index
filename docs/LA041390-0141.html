			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OFFICIALS ALTER TRAIN SCHEDULE, MISS THE BUS  </P> <P> Orange County Transportation Commission officials have learned at least one  lesson when it comes to dealing with Amtrak commuters: Don't mess with the  train schedules.  </P> <P> Fifteen minutes one way or another can make or break a commute for someone who  depends on the Los Angeles bus system for another leg of the daily journey.  Just ask Lorrie Hutton.  </P> <P> "It sounds picky, but it means the difference between riding the train and not  riding the train," said Hutton, who commutes daily between Fullerton and Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> So when authorities announced plans to switch the departure time for the train  that Hutton rides back to Orange County each evening, she was none too pleased.  Banding together with scores of regular train riders, Hutton and her fellow  commuters have spent the last two weeks fomenting opposition to the switch,  which would bump the regular 5:45 p.m. departure time up to 5:30.  </P> <P> Walking the length of the train daily, Hutton and others have been rallying  their forces, collecting signatures on copies of letters of protest that are  being dispatched to the commission, demanding the return of the 5:45.  </P> <P> But the answer to the commuters' concerns may be on its way to Southern  California from San Jose. Amtrak has agreed to lease an additional train to  make the 5:45 p.m. run. The new train is coming from CalTrain, a commuter line  between San Jose and San Francisco.  </P> <P> "We're 99% sure the new train will enable us to leave Los Angeles at 5:45,"  said Adrienne Brooks, the commission's associate transportation analyst.  </P> <P> The problem arose during the planning of the new and much-heralded $1.8-million  commuter train service between San Juan Capistrano and Los Angeles, scheduled  to start April 30. In order to attract riders, the Transportation Commission  hammered out a deal with Amtrak to institute a new morning and evening commuter  run between San Juan Capistrano and Los Angeles with stops in several other  Orange County stations.  </P> <P> During the planning process, however, a glitch in the train scheduling prompted  commission officials to propose shifting the 5:45 p.m. return trip to Orange  County to 5:30, Brooks said. That would have meant the next available train for  commuters who couldn't make it to the station by 5:30 p.m. would not leave  until 6:20 p.m.  </P> <P> And that's when Hutton and her fellow travelers decided they were not going to  sit and take it.  </P> <P> Hutton pays $180 each month to ride from Fullerton to Los Angeles and back five  days a week. From the time she leaves her home in the morning until she arrives  back in her driveway, it's about a 12-hour day. She embarks in the morning on  the 7:16 train to Los Angeles, arriving in about 35 minutes, and then catches a  bus to her office at 8th and Hope streets.  </P> <P> "In the evening the traffic is much worse," Hutton said. "It takes those of us  who work in the vicinity of my office about an hour to get back to the train,  when we allow time to wait for the bus, catch the bus and then walk to the  train. I don't think those people who make transportation decisions factor  these things in."  </P></p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Observer: Better late than never What's Hanson up to in Australia? Having toyed with the idea of selling its 40 per cent stake in Renison Goldfields, which it inherited with its 1989 takeover of Consolidated Gold Fields, it seems to have decided to try to make a go of it. Tony Cotton, 50, one of Lord Hanson's ablest lieutenants, has been sent down under to take over as chairman. It's an unusual move for a company that has 98 per cent of its capital tied up in North America and the UK. Hanson has never shown much interest in the Pacific basin and Renison is a bit of a tiddler in the world mining industry. If Derek Bonham, Hanson's relatively new chief executive, wants to prove that Hanson's world extends beyond the North Atlantic, Renison will need beefing up substantially. Rival BTR has already shown what can be done down under. Who knows, Tony Cotton could be Hanson's answer to BTR chief executive Alan Jackson, who made his name at BTR Nylex.</p>

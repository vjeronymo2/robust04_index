			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / National insurance increase 'brutal' The Labour party yesterday renewed its attack on the government's 1 percentage-point increase in employee's National Insurance contributions, saying that the move was 'brutal' and had 'somewhat sinister possibilities in terms of future policy'. The accusations came at the start of a debate on a bill introducing the contributions measure, which was due to pass through all its Commons stages in six hours last night. Mr Nicholas Scott, the social security minister, said in opening the debate that the 'modest' rise was necessary because income was not keeping pace with spending in the National Insurance fund. Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, said that the rise had a 'key and rather dishonourable' role in the government's strategy of forcing up taxes to the equivalent of 7p on the standard rate of income tax. He said: 'It is a rise in taxation - a substantial rise in taxation that affects the vast majority of the working population.' Major predicts improvement, Page 12</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Khartoum, 24 Jun (SUNA) -- Dr. Husayn Sulayman  Abu-Salih, the foreign minister, has said that Sudan's foreign  relations with African, Asian, and neighboring states are stable  and are developing based on common interests and the  strengthening of economic and technical cooperation.    In an interview published by the Jordanian newspaper AL  DUSTUR at the end of the 30th summit of African heads of state  which was quoted by the Sudanese AL INQADH AL-WATANI newspaper,  Abu-Salih added that Sudan's relations with some Western states  were better than its relations with Iran.    He accused Britain of conveying misleading information on  Sudan to the United States, which portrayed the people's defense  camps as places for training foreigners in Sudan. He said we  still challenge any quarter to prove that a single foreigner has  completed his training in Sudan.</p>

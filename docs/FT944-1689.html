			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Company News (This Week and Next): E Midlands holders hope for more cheer - Other companies East Midlands Electricity will today bring the power results season to a close when it announces profits and dividends for the half-year to September 30. Last October the company announced it was to give back Pounds 186m to shareholders as a special dividend, or 85p per share. It chose this route rather than buying back shares. The interim dividend may therefore be less generous than other regional electricity companies have been able to provide. Nonetheless, at least 15 per cent is expected and profits are likely to be well ahead.</p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / People: Central England Training and Enterprise Council Terry Morgan, managing director of Land Rover Vehicles, has been appointed chairman of Central England Training and Enterprise Council. He succeeds Edward Roberts, chief executive of Heath Springs, who will remain on the board of the Tec and will become the first president. Roberts, who has been four years in the chair, is chairman of the Tec National Council which replaces G10, the group of Tec directors which represents Tecs' common interests to the government. Morgan, chairman of Solihull Chamber of Industry and Commerce, was a founder member of Centec. A Welshman who still plays a mean game of rugby, Morgan practices what he will preach at the Tec - Land Rover has just been designated a practitioner of Investors in People, a national initiative implemented at the local level by Tecs, which seeks to improve the training of people in work.</p>

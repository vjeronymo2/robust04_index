			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Asia: Korean group in engines deal with Rover Rover, the UK subsidiary of BMW of Germany, has signed an agreement with Kia, the second largest South Korean carmaker, to jointly develop a new range of engines to be built in the UK and Korea. Rover said that the joint engine development programme, the first it has undertaken with a rival carmaker, would involve an investment of around Pounds 30m. It is understood that the agreement with Kia is for the development of a range of V6 engines that will be developed from Rover's existing K-Series small car engines. The 2.5 litre Rover V6 is expected to be fitted first in the UK carmaker's flagship Rover 800 executive car late next year replacing the Honda V6 engine currently imported from Japan. It will be produced at Rover's Longbridge, Birmingham plant. The Kia version of the V6 engine will be produced in Korea for use in a new range of Kia executive cars under development. Rover is in the midst of an ambitious programme to develop the highly successful K-Series engine in order to give it far greater independence from Honda, its Japanese partner, in engine production. The K-Series, which was launched in 1.1 and 1.4 litre versions in 1989 after a Pounds 200m investment programme, is also being developed in larger 1.6 and 1.8 litre versions for use respectively in the new Rover 400 family car and MG sports car ranges to be launched next year. Separately Rover expects to begin its first car assembly in East Europe in spring next year with the start-up in Bulgaria of joint venture production of its Maestro small family car range. In Bulgaria, where Rover has formed a joint venture with the Sofia-based Daru group, the UK carmaker expects to begin assembly of the ageing Maestro at a plant at Varna on the Black Sea coast in the spring next year. Output is expected to total 3,000 in 1995 and could rise in later years to 10,000 annually including exports to other east European markets. Assembly in Bulgaria will be on the basis of SKD (semi-knocked down) kits supplied from Rover's Cowley, Oxford plant. Painted bodies will be shipped from Cowley to Varna for local final assembly, but Rover is aiming to increase gradually the purchase of components in Bulgaria. Production of the Maestro - launched in 1983 - for the UK market is expected to cease by the end of the year. Rover investment in the project is expected to total Pounds 2m-Pounds 3m. Rover has taken a 51 per cent stake and management control in the joint venture. Daru, which will hold 49 per cent and is already the local BMW distributor, has also been appointed the distributor for Rover and Land Rover vehicles in Bulgaria. The two groups have put out to local tender contracts for the conversion and refurbishment of a factory in Varna, which will be used for the Maestro assembly. The Rover group has taken several moves to internationalise it operations this year. These include: An agreement earlier this month to invest Pounds 10m in a new assembly facility and sales and marketing organisation for Land Rover Discovery and Defender models in South Africa with assembly taking place at an existing BMW plant at Rosslyn, near Pretoria. The production under licence in Brazil by Iochpe-Maxion of the Land Rover 300Tdi diesel engine. Rover is also seeking to develop further a memorandum of understanding it has signed with the Sipani group in India for the local assembly of the Montego large family car and Rover's two-litre turbo-diesel engine.</p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Labour plans autumn of attrition TIME and again Labour has been gazumped in the role of opposition by Conservative backbenchers. Signs yesterday that the government is now shifting towards a 'go for growth' policy suggest that Labour's high command may now be overtaken even by its frontbench opponents. With the government's autumn rendered a shambles by the Mellor affair, Black Wednesday and now the coal fiasco, it is hardly surprising that the official opposition has been absorbed by short-term planning. Indeed, Labour managers were yesterday concentrating their efforts to ensure that the political atrophy of three terms on the opposition benches will not undermine a full turnout to the three-line whip tonight. Uncomfortable memories linger of opportunities to defeat the government  - the last being Mr Michael Mates' amendment on the poll tax - missed due to indiscipline among the troops. But the attention paid to marshalling the troops to cope with the day-to-day realities of a government with a 21-seat majority has also left Labour looking myopic and sluggish. Last week, for example, some complained that it was outraged public opinion, not the Labour leadership, that most efficiently exposed the government's cackhanded management of the pit closures announcement. 'Robin Cook talked about butchery, but it was ritual stuff,' said one Labour backbench MP. 'In the end as usual, we were caught leading from the back.' Since then, an impressive performance by the shadow industry secretary at the despatch box has mollified that criticism. Meanwhile, things have moved on. Just as policy moves such as the government's Citizen's Charter initiative appeared to seize an opportunity missed by Labour, so a clear government hint that deflation not inflation is now public enemy number one will inevitably steal fire that could have been Labour's. In part, that is a consequence of the media's lack of interest in Labour's policy prescriptions after four election defeats. The party's image brokers will certainly complain that its advocacy of supply-side policies have shown it way ahead of government thinking for more than a year. Yet as the recession has appeared to teeter on the brink of full-blown slump, there are many Labour backbenchers now claiming that Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, has been too slow to respond with new policy initiatives. Critics of the party leadership are currently content to confine their gripes to whispered remarks in the bars and tea rooms. But there is a widespread complaint - fuelled by an idea-free annual conference - that Labour is reactive, not active: tactical not strategic. Senior party figures insist that that will not be the case for long. But the deliberate decision not to become engrossed in policymaking so early in a parliament is now running up against the public's clearly impassioned plea that 'something must be done' about the recession. In that context, the shadow cabinet last week broadly agreed that flesh must be put on the skeleton of Mr Brown's much recited three-point economic plan  -industrial incentives, employment measures, and a housebuilding programme. But what? The promise of a Roosevelt-style 'New Deal' is still deemed too ambitious. Crypto-monetarist orthodoxy is such that Ms Diane Abbott, the leftwinger from Hackney, incurred the displeasure of the shadow chancellor for suggesting in the Treasury committee that Britain had entered the exchange rate mechanism at the wrong parity. Nonetheless, Mr Brown is himself under pressure from colleagues to temper his natural caution in order for the party to have a more comprehensive recovery plan in place by the time of next month's autumn statement. Last week, attention in the shadow cabinet returned to two topics. The first is consideration of reworking the definition of the public-sector borrowing requirement along the lines of those used by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Such looser criteria would allow Labour to claim that the raising of finance in the money markets by state-sector industries and notional spending such as the government's underwriting of private-sector schemes should escape inclusion in the PSBR. Work is also under way on developing a distinction between capital projects and current spending. Labour's leaders are also examining the possibility of designating some specific labour-intensive infrastructural schemes - transport other than road programmes, for example - as priorities, emphasising the opposition's claim to be the true party of industry. Yet, for the time being, the stress on caution remains. Meanwhile, the government looks poised to occupy at least part of that territory under a new Growth First banner. Proud of its pre-Black Wednesday record as the party of sound money, Labour's Scottish establishment is far from risking the accusation that it is ready to embrace a little inflation as the necessary price of recovery. The government appears to be tacitly hinting just that.</p>

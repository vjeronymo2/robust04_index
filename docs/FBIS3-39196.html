			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Kooijmans by Nederland-1 </F> anchorman Joop van Zijl; Kooijmans in Geneva and Van Zijl in  Hiversum studio -- live]    [Text] [Van Zijl] Good evening, Mr. Kooijmans.    [Kooijmans] Good evening.    [Van Zijl] Last Monday [7 February], after the meeting of  the  European Ministers, you were about the only one to speak of a  "ultimatum," although no decision had been made yet. But there  is actually a ultimatum now that NATO has made a U-turn. Does  that please you?    [Kooijmans] No, it does not [as heard], but I am satisfied  that the international community has actually started to do  something and has imposed a credible deadline within which  certain things will have to be done.    [Van Zijl] Still, dangerous times may lie ahead. What is  your assessment of the danger for the Dutch soldiers?    [Kooijmans] It is very difficult to say. Certain security  measures have already been taken for the ground troops, i.e. if  attacks are directed against UN troops, the representative of  the [UN] Secretary General in Yugoslavia, Mr. Akashi, can ask  for air support. That is already a certain guarantee. And it  is well possible that now that the international community has  finally used some credible language, this will also benefit the  situation of the ground troops.    [Van Zijl] And then there are also our Dutch planes -- the  F16s -- stationed in Villafranca....    [Kooijmans] Yes, indeed, together with the French, the U.S.,  the British and the Turkish planes.    [Van Zijl] Now, a few words on politics: The Russians are  being obstructive and are calling for an emergency meeting of  the [UN] Security Council. Does this make sense?    [Kooijmans] Well, yes they have the right to do so... But  resolution 836 gives the final authority to the [UN] Secretary  General and that resolution would have to be revoked, which in  my opinion is not very likely.    [Van Zijl] Finally Mr. Kooijmans, what is your personal  feeling at this time? Have we finally reached some point or is  this just a stop on the way to a fatal outcome?    [Kooijmans] Well, we have achieved something, we have  reached  a point where we have stated that some things are not tolerated.  We are ready, if need be, to intervene with an iron hand, but I  hope that this will not be necessary; a real peace agreement can  only be achieved by the waring parties themselves.    [Van Zijl] Many thanks for your comments, Mr. Minister.</p>

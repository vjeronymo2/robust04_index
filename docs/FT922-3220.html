			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / International Company News: Upjohn re-applies for FDA approval of contraceptive UPJOHN, the US drugs company, has applied to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the hopes of getting approval to market an injectable contraceptive product in the US. The company said it would seek approval a second time to market the drug Depo-Provera as a contraceptive. In the 1970s, the FDA declined to give the green light for the drug's marketing as a contraceptive because of questions about its safety. A board of public inquiry, later asked by Upjohn to review the FDA decision, ruled against the company in 1984. The key concern at the FDA was data from an Upjohn study suggesting Depo-Provera caused breast cancer in beagles. The FDA has since decided the beagle dog was not an appropriate animal model for predicting cancer effects in humans. The drug is, however, already on the US market for use in treating kidney and endometrial cancers. Analysts estimate its US sales at Dollars 108m, while revenues from non-US markets, where the drug is sold in some 90 countries as a contraceptive and as an anti-cancer product, are estimated at an additional Dollars 74m. More than 30m women in 60 countries are understood to use the drug as a contraceptive. Although Upjohn has not conducted any new studies of the drug since withdrawing its last application, it has told the FDA a study by the World Health Organisation concluded the use of Depo-Provera as a contraceptive did not constitute a health risk. Mr Melvin Goodes, chairman of Warner Lambert, the US pharmaceutical and consumer products group, expects second-quarter 1992 net earnings per share to rise by 13 per cent year-on-year, suggesting a net profit of about Dollars 175m. Earnings per share would be about Dollars 1.30, against Dollars 1.15 in the same period of 1991. Mr Goodes said the rise would place Warner-Lambert on track to improve full-year 1992 earnings by about 15 per cent. But full-year comparison is only appropriate when comparing 1991 earnings before a Dollars 544m accounting adjustment, and other restructuring charges. Net income in 1991 was only Dollars 34.8m after all charges were taken.</p>

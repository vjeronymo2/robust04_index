			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Birthday Bash: British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher turned 65 Saturday but  has no intention of slowing down. She marked the milestone with a family  celebration at the prime minister's country residence.  </P> <P> Members of her Conservative Party called for 10 more years of her leadership.  "I am not immortal," she said recently, "but I've got a lot left in me yet."  Thatcher became prime minister in 1979.  </P> <P> Sorry Charlie: Charles Keating, the recently incarcerated savings and loan  exec, got a send-off from the Camp Beverly Hills clothing company: a T-shirt  with his black-and-white prison mug shot and the words "So Long." Said the firm  in a news release: "The shirt may give some relief from this frustrating  bungle."  </P> <P> Dream Job: Talk show host Larry King says in People magazine that his fantasy  interview would be with Jesus Christ: "I would ask him if he believed that he  was born of virgin birth, because whatever the answer is changes or reinforces  the world." King, 56, said his toughest interviews were Demond Wilson, who  starred in the TV series "Sanford and Son," and actor Robert Mitchum. Wilson  "was brash and obnoxious." Mitchum "just gave me one-word answers," said King.  </P> <P> Aussie Has Heart: Australian media mogul Kerry Packer is donating $2 million to  the ambulance service to buy heart revival machines like the one that saved his  life when his heart stopped during a polo match. Packer, considered the richest  Aussie, later made front-page headlines when he was involved in a scuffle with  a newspaper photographer Saturday on the same polo grounds where he collapsed  earlier in the week.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'AS NASTY' OBSCENITY CASE DROPPED;  </P> <P> RAP: SAN ANTONIO RECORD STORE OWNER IS 'PLEASANTLY SURPRISED.' JUDGE SAYS HE'LL  RECOMMEND DISMISSING ANY FUTURE CASES BASED ON THE 2 LIVE CREW ALBUM.  </P> <P> Without explanation, prosecutors today dropped obscenity charges against a  record store owner who had been arrested for selling the rap album "As Nasty as  They Wanna Be" by 2 Live Crew.  </P> <P> County Court-At-Law Judge Tony Jimenez III granted the prosecutors' request as  Dave Risher's trial was set to begin.  </P> <P> "I thought we were going to trial today. I'm pleasantly surprised," Risher said  as he emerged from the courtroom to cheers and applause.  </P> <P> As the trial began, Assistant Dist. Atty. Pat Hancock asked that the case  against Risher be dropped.  </P> <P> Jimenez honored the request and said he could not understand why it had taken  six months to decide not to prosecute the case.  </P> <P> Hancock gave no reason for the dismissal; prosecutors were not immediately  available to discuss the decision.  </P> <P> But the mother of the individual whose purchase of the album led to the charges  said prosecutors didn't believe they had a case.  </P> <P> "They chose to dismiss it because they thought they didn't have a case to put  before a jury," said Teresa Weaver, president of Citizens Against Pornography.  "I think if there's a blame to be placed it has to be on the (judicial)  system."  </P> <P> Weaver also said her son Patrick, who bought the album, no longer believes that  the entire rap album met an obscenity definition.  </P> <P> Based on this case, Jimenez said he will also recommend that future obscenity  cases involving the record be dismissed. No cases are pending.  </P> <P> Risher was charged in June after San Antonio police vice officers visited local  record stores and told owners and managers that the album had been declared  obscene by a federal judge in Florida.  </P> <P> After that declaration, one record store owner in Florida was found guilty of  misdemeanor obscenity, but in another members of the rap group were acquitted  of similar charges involving a live performance of some of their material.  </P> <P> In the Texas case, officers asked store operators to sign statements saying  they had been given the warning. Risher refused to sign.  </P> <P> Days after the warning, Patrick Weaver bought the album at Risher's store and  filed a complaint with police.  </P> <P> Promotion of pornography, a Class A misdemeanor, carries a fine of one year in  jail, a $1,000 fine or both.  </P> <P> "I can't wait to get back to work," said Risher, owner of Hogwild Records &amp;  Tapes.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys had planned to call music critics, professors and a pollster  as witnesses on Risher's behalf. Defense attorney Robert Switzer said he was  pleased with the ruling and considered it a victory.  </P></p>

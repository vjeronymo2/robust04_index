			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LITTLE FRIENDS OF THE EARTH;  </P> <P> THE ANTS BY BERT HOLLDOBLER AND E. O. WILSON (HARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESS: $65;  709 PP., ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> Who hasn't at some time been intrigued by ants? Even while cursing their  invasion of the pantry, we admire the lone scout hurrying along with the news,  or the knot of workers conveying a single crumb across the unprotected  wasteland of a kitchen floor. But I was unaware until I read "The Ants" that  colonies range from those with only 50 workers to colonies whose populations  exceed hundreds of thousands, even a million individuals.  </P> <P> Of all the world's myrmecologists -- that is, students of the 8,000-odd members  of the family Formicidae (ants) in the order Hymenoptera (which also includes  bees and wasps) -- perhaps none is as well known to the public as E. O. Wilson.  With the publication of "Insect Societies" in 1971 and then "Sociobiology" in  1976, Wilson announced that evolutionary biology has theoretical implications  that go beyond the anthill. There are echoes of both of these earlier books in  "The Ants," which Wilson has written with his colleague Bert Holldobler.  </P> <P> In "Insect Societies," Wilson discussed the evolution of insects from presocial  beetles to the eusocial hives and mounds of ants, bees, wasps and termites that  have sometimes been described as "superorganisms." Ants epitomize this kind of  community in which several generations overlap, and individuals are divided  into specialized castes that cooperate in producing and raising the young.  </P> <P> In 1971, Wilson observed that many of his theories would only be proved with  the reconstruction of the full colonial system in vitro, in the laboratory,  which was an impossibility 20 years ago. Since then, however, procedures to  isolate and expose individual ants to synthetic sounds and smells have become  routine, and what was then theory is now experimentally verified. Wilson and  fellow entomologists have reared isolated ants, honey bees and termite larvae  and determined their caste by an appropriate manipulation of food and hormones.  </P> <P> Sociobiology as a scientific method has weathered stormy debates, many provoked  by Wilson's insistence that the kind of reductionism that successfully explains  insect behavior as a predictable response in relatively simple animals like  ants can be applied to higher vertebrates, like ourselves. Over the last 15  years, the analysis of kinship relations and investment strategies within  species has become one of the most sophisticated areas of evolutionary biology.  In "The Ants," Holldobler and Wilson describe the measured investment by adult  ants in the survival of their offspring, using what they admit are value-laden  words such as altruism to explain the intricate and varied ways that colonies  respond to environmental change.  </P> <P> But why write an entire book just about ants?  </P> <P> Because ants are crucial participants in the ecological systems of all of our  fragile forests and, even more than earthworms, are nature's leading soil  turners. We need to know as much as we can about them as we race to save the  ecological balance of this planet.  </P> <P> On another level, as the culmination of insect evolution, ants can explain a  lot about how evolution works. Different species of ants have evolved ways to  enslave each other, to "domesticate" a species of aphid, which they herd and  "milk" for honeydew, to organize military campaigns against their neighbors.  They are able to achieve these complicated systems through complex forms of  chemical communication and through the evolution of altruism, the apparent  trade-off of individual sacrifice for the welfare of the colony.  </P> <P> "The Ants" is a beautiful volume, with hundreds of line drawings and colored  plates. It is an encyclopedia of ants, containing lists and descriptions, a  glossary and a complete bibliography in addition to histories and discussions  of the relationships within ant communities and between ant species, as well as  symbiosis with other insects and with plants.  </P> <P> For the novitiate, there are clear, detailed descriptions of the body parts,  along with an explanation of their functions. There is also, at the conclusion  (by which time the authors are secure in having made a number of converts), a  guide for the novice in how to collect and set up ant colonies or farms. They  mention how the late Harlow Shapley, a famous astronomer and amateur ant  collector, found a rare ant while dining with Stalin in the Kremlin, placed it  in vodka, and brought it back to the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard,  where it is still on display.  </P> <P> For the professional, there are judicious explanations of the rival theories of  "kin selection" (in which individuals are apparently willing to make sacrifices  for those very close to themselves genetically, like a sister) and "parental  manipulation" (the suggestion that parents willingly exploit some of their  children for the perceived larger good of the next generation) to explain why  some individual ants are apparently willing to forgo their own reproductive  option to provide for their mothers and sisters.  </P> <P> For pundits interested in the roles of the sexes in evolution, there is  dramatic evidence that females guide and dominate ant populations: "The ant  colony is an almost exclusively female society, with the males remaining in the  nest only until the time of their invariably fatal nuptial flight." Most  colonies have a single queen (although there are some with more) that  determines the assignments of the workers, all female, in regards to nourishing  and protecting the next generation they are preparing for life cycles of their  own.  </P> <P> Aging workers of Australia's green tree ants emigrate to special "barrack  nests" at the territorial boundary of the colony, the first line of defense  when workers from neighboring nests invade. This stimulated Holldobler to note:  "It can be said that a principal difference between human beings and ants is  that whereas we send our young men to war, they send their old ladies."  </P> <P> The recent discovery of eusocial life in a rare, burrow-dwelling African  mammal, the naked mole-rat, puts the question of these "super-organisms" in a  new light. The similarity between mole-rats and ants suggests that insects and  vertebrates may have more in common than zoologists once thought.  </P></p>

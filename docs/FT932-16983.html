			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: Recovery continues as Koor climbs 45% KOOR Industries, Israel's largest industrial concern, has reported a 45 per cent increase in 1992 net profits to Shk375m (Dollars 136m). Faced with the threat of liquidation four years ago, Koor has undergone a remarkable recovery, becoming one of Israel's most profitable industrial companies. The company, which has holdings in electronics, building supplies, chemicals, steel and metals, food and trade, reported sales 7 per cent ahead at Shk6.08bn. During 1992, Koor repaid all its debts to the Israeli banks, several years ahead of the schedule agreed within the framework of its debt restructuring programme. Mr Benjamin Gaon, president, said: 'Now, as a result of this achievement, improved operating results, and increased shareholders' equity, our new three-year development and investment plan is under way. 'We expect this year to bring an increase in sales, including greater exports,' he added.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Israel has so far prevented Dr. Samir Ghawshah, the  official in charge of the labor portfolio in the Palestinian  Authority; Fatah Central Committee member Abu-Mahir Ghunaym; and  poet Mahmud Darwish from entering the autonomy area. Our  correspondent Moti Amir has learned this from Palestinian  sources. Fadil Tahbub, member of the Popular Struggle Front,  told our correspondent that Dr. Ghawshah, leader of the front,  seeks to enter the autonomy area in order to turn his  organization into a political party which will be able to run in  the autonomy elections.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0800 GMT on 20 June  adds: "A senior security source told our correspondent Moti Amir  that nobody is preventing Samir Ghawshah from entering the  autonomy area. The source denied the Palestinian sources' claims  that Israel is preventing Dr. Ghawshah from entering the  autonomy."    ["Dr. Ghawshah told our correspondent that the PLO has  submitted a list of names of approximately 500 PLO members who  are slated to arrive in the autonomy, including approximately  one-third of the Fatah Central Committee members in Tunis. So  far, Israel has not agreed to their request to enter the  autonomy."]</p>

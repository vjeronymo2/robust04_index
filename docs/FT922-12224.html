			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Gadaffi turns to Egypt in sanctions dispute LIBYAN leader Colonel Muammer Gadaffi is due to meet Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak today to discuss the United Nations sanctions imposed to back demands for extradition of the two alleged Lockerbie bombers, Egyptian officials announced, AP reports from Cairo. It will be Col Gadaffi's first trip out of Libya since the UN Security Council voted to cut off air travel and impose arms and diplomatic embargoes on Libya on March 31. The sanctions went into force last Wednesday. Libya told foreign journalists yesterday to stop reporting from Tripoli and continued tit-for-tat expulsions of European diplomats. The air embargo held for a sixth day after Syria decided against sending an airliner to the Libyan capital. The Egyptian officials in Cairo who announced Col Gadaffi's visit did not disclose how he would reach the summit site, at Sidi el-Barrani, a military airfield 50 miles east of the border on Egypt's Mediterranean coast. Col Gadaffi could fly to the Libyan city of Tobruk west of the border, drive across the frontier and fly or drive to Sidi el-Barrani. That would not violate the UN sanctions.</p>

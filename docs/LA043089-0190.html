			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALL STREET / JOHN CRUDELE: EVEN THE EXPERTS DISAGREE ON THE MARKET'S DIRECTION  </P> <P> Stock prices have risen almost 10% since last fall, but the climb hasn't always  been smooth. The market dipped sharply for a while in February and then again  in March as Wall Street wrestled with the fact that interest rates were  climbing at a quicker pace than at anytime in the past few years.  </P> <P> Right now, most of the thinkers on Wall Street -- the market strategists,  analysts and money managers -- are euphoric about the stock market's impressive  showing over the past few weeks. In April, the closely watched Dow Jones  industrial average rose to its highest level since the October, 1987, crash.  </P> <P> But many traders -- the folks on the front line, as well as a small minority of  strategists -- still aren't celebrating. They're concerned that if interest  rates go up another notch or so, the smiles will fade quickly and the market  will be bowled over. They also are bothered by the fact that a slowdown in the  economy -- one of the chief factors that could bring interest rates down --  also might create a concern that corporate profits will be hurt.  </P> <P> Last week I asked three Wall Street pros with widely different opinions of  what's in store for the stock market to argue their cases. Here's what they had  to say:  </P> <P> * Joseph Feshbach, senior vice president of market analysis with  Prudential-Bache Securities, has long been very high on the stock market's  chances for success. He hasn't changed that opinion one iota, except that he  now believes prices could backtrack a bit temporarily from current levels.  </P> <P> "Investors and Wall Street are of the mentality that they have to be protective  of their assets at this point. The whole planet has become very risk averse,"  says Feshbach, who doesn't believe people have yet gotten over the crash.  </P> <P> "There is a complete disinterest and distrust of equities," says Feshbach.  </P> <P> He believes that the best thing an investor can do is go against the prevailing  mood. "You always look for where investors are not. That's where the greatest  potential is," Feshbach adds. At the current time, that's the stock market.  </P> <P> People who get into the market now could see their investment appreciate nicely  over the next few years, Feshbach believes. "I think we will average a 15% to  20% gain in the market in each of the next four to five years," he says. "It's  the bull market that never was. And I think the market will go up without the  excesses of the last few years."  </P> <P> Feshbach believes that the dollar has been stabilized and won't be subject to  the wide swings of recent years. That, he says, will bring foreign investors  back into the U.S. stock and bond markets. Foreigners, especially the Japanese,  have been much less a factor in the U.S. stock market in recent years because  of concern about the dollar.  </P> <P> Feshbach doesn't think investors have to worry about interest rates either.  "Interest rates will be stable for the rest of the year. They will be a  non-event," he predicts. Likewise, the economy will continue to grow at a  steady, non-inflationary pace that won't create unusual concerns about  inflation. But Feshbach does concede that an occasional monthly economic figure  could still either excite or horrify Wall Street, depending on whether or not  it forecasts inflation.  </P> <P> * Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer for First Albany Corp., is concerned  about the stock market's recent performance. "I feel the way I felt in the  summer of 1987," says Johnson. "I feel uncomfortable with current stock market  levels."  </P> <P> Johnson is not predicting another crash, but he does think that the Dow could  easily fall about 270 points from the 2,400 level that it reached this month.  The fall could be even greater if -- as Johnson believes -- stock prices climb  a bit more before suffering a reversal.  </P> <P> Why is Johnson concerned about the stock market down the road? "If interest  rates are high, it's hard to justify (buying) stocks. And interest rates are  high," he says.  </P> <P> Even worse, rising oil prices probably will increase concern over inflation in  the months ahead and "it may demand that the Federal Reserve respond by raising  interest rates."  </P> <P> Also, if interest rates go up overseas (as they did in West Germany two weeks  ago), that could force rates up in the United States. If the Fed does not  respond by raising interest rates, the dollar could suffer and even more  foreign investors could be driven out of America's financial markets.  </P> <P> Johnson also said his analytical work suggests that corporate profits aren't of  the same "quality" as they were in the early 1980s because of changes in the  tax laws. By "quality," Johnson means that companies are not generating as much  cash from their operations as they once did.  </P> <P> Without the cash, Johnson says, it will be harder for companies to restructure  themselves or buy other companies. And mergers, acquisitions and restructurings  were one of the prime components of the stock market's good fortune during the  1980s.  </P> <P> Johnson says the risk of a recession later this year or in early 1990 also  could make the stock market treacherous. "Common sense tells you, at the  minimum, be vigilant, but most likely you should be defensive."  </P> <P> After 1990, Johnson thinks that stocks will be a good investment again. The  economy will slow, labor shortages will ease and factories won't be cranking  out widgets at such a frantic pace. Inflation fears then will ease, interest  rates will decline and investors will be looking for a good place to put their  money. "Then I like stocks," Johnson concluded.  </P> <P> * Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist at Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben,  Cleveland, probably represents the majority of experts when he predicts that  the stock market won't do much in the short run. "It's not going to be bullish  because it's fully priced. It's not going to be bearish, either, because there  is too much money on the sidelines," he says.  </P> <P> Interest rates may go up a bit, Chalasani says. But, he says, "I believe the  market has already taken this into account."  </P> <P> Gulf &amp; Western Inc. announced a few weeks ago that it no longer wants to be  in the financial services business. And an investment banker who puts together  deals in that industry says this could be the start of a trend.  </P> <P> Robert Stearns, of Shearson Lehman Hutton, says corporations that bought  financial service companies years ago in diversification efforts may be having  a change of heart. He says that, while these financial businesses have done  well, they also have been a drag on stock prices.  </P> <P> There is one problem that Stearns sees. "Who's going to buy them?" he asks.  </P> <P> Since banks are legally able to loan out 20 times the amount of capital they  hold, and financial services organizations only seven times their capital,  banks are in a superior competitive position. So banks are, therefore, the most  natural buyer of these financial organizations.  </P> <P> But banks have more than enough things to buy these days, especially with  failing savings and loans coming on the market by the bushel-full.  </P> <P> Have you noticed that there aren't many takeover attempts being initiated these  days?  </P> <P> While there are still plenty of rumors about takeovers and a lot of folks on  Wall Street who think that they know what a company would be worth if taken  over, there has been, in fact, a sharp falloff in the number of actual deals.  </P> <P> One investment banker who represents a number of very acquisitive clients says  rising interest rates, climbing stock prices and the recent chaos in the "junk  bond" market have sent the people he works for running. Will things pick up  soon? "I'd take a vacation," this investment banker advises.  </P> <P> According to M&amp;A Database, Philadelphia, there were 1,069 deals announced  between January 1 and last week. In that same period last year there were 1,505  transactions.  </P> <P> Thirty-nine percent of workers who've ever been fired were let go because of  incompetence, according to a survey by Robert Half International, the  recruiting consulting firm. But 17% were fired because they didn't get along  with co-workers, 12% for dishonesty or lying and 10% because they had a  negative attitude. The consulting firm also said one-quarter of all employees  will be fired at some time . . .  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the outplacement consulting firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas  Inc. says only one out of every five job seekers is willing to go to work for a  troubled company. "To the risk taker, a situation where a company has lost  substantial share of market or has undergone large-scale cutbacks in facilities  and personnel is exciting," says James Challenger . . .  </P> <P> Analyst Lawrence Harris of Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, whose prediction of  a restructuring at Lockheed was right on the money, thinks that Martin Marietta  and Raytheon are the next two aerospace companies that eventually will undergo  shake-ups . . .  </P> <P> The rumor that Robert Maxwell is interested in acquiring McGraw-Hill has been  around for a long time. But a Wall Street source close to the British  publisher/investor says the rumor wasn't true the first half-dozen times it  made the rounds and wasn't true last week when it made the rounds again. But  the source does add that McGraw-Hill might be interesting enough for someone to  go after . . .  </P> <P> Believe it or not, NWA Corp. is said to be thinking about selling off some  assets -- including its Japanese real estate -- to help avoid a takeover.  Proceeds from sale of the assets presumably would be used to pay a special  dividend to shareholders. While most experts think that it's a little too late  for this tactic, NWA is said to be seriously looking into this possibility and  making contact with prospective buyers . . .  </P> <P> Prudential-Bache Securities analyst B. Alex Henderson estimates that Xerox  would be worth $100 to $125 a share if it were broken up. That's almost twice  what the stock is selling for. But Henderson thinks the likelihood of a breakup  is slim. Nevertheless, Xerox's stock rose sharply on his report.  </P></p>

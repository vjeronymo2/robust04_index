			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / UK Company News: General Consol net assets fall Net assets per share of General Consolidated Investment Trust fell by 26 per cent to 214.3p over the six months to June 30, against 290p at the end of 1993. Net revenue increased from Pounds 1.45m to Pounds 1.61m largely reflecting a substantial increase in management fees earned by the trust's 53 per cent investment management offshoot. This was unlikely to be repeated in the second half. Earnings per income share were 4.45p (4.01p). An unchanged interim dividend of 3.9p has been declared.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Juan Carlos Santoyo from San Cristobal de las </F> Casas, Chiapas; from the "ACIR Radio News" newscast -- live]    [Excerpt] [Santoyo] Special Peace Commissioner Manuel  Camacho Solis was scheduled to arrive here today, but this did  not occur. As we reported this morning, the bishop of San  Cristobal de las Casas reported yesterday that Camacho Solis was  scheduled to arrive today because of a possible reply from the  EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army] on what could be new  conditions or new efforts in the second phase of the peace talks.    Until now, the only thing we have been told at the  archdiocese is that Manuel Camacho Solis' arrival has been  postponed one or two days. His date of arrival has not yet been  confirmed. Nevertheless, we have been told he will be here in  the near future.    We are now waiting for the fulfillment of what Samuel Ruiz,  bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, said would be the [word  indistinct] reply by the EZLN. This is important because, with  this reply, one might be able to get an idea about what the  second phase of the dialogue will be like. Indeed, this  dialogue is near at hand.    In another turn of events, in San Cristobal de las Casas,  the  nomination of Robledo Rincon as candidate for governor for the  State of Chiapas has been accepted nonchalantly. This  appointment is being seen here in a good light because Rincon is  already a legislator who, as has been pointed out, has worked a  great deal for the region. Little by little, he has toured the  entire state and is familiar with its problems.    [Announcer Jose Cardenas from the Radio ACIR studios in  Mexico City] Do you remember that it was none other than Senator  Robledo Rincon, along with Heraclio Zepeda and -- if I am not  mistaken -- anthropologist Andres Fabrega, who formed part of  the first commission created following President Carlos Salinas  de Gortari's instructions on [16-second break in reception]  conflict with EZLN. By the way, Robledo Rincon was one of the  people closest to Luis Donaldo Colosio. This commission was to  find a solution to this problem. This was the initiation of the  dialogue [25-second break in reception]    [Santoyo, in progress] ...remember this because I was a  witness during this very interesting stage. [26-second break in  reception] here in Chiapas in favor of the peasants and Indians,  but that respect for their traditions and customs also had to be  taken into account.    Nevertheless, Senator Rincon indicated that the task was  going to be very difficult. They were able to do this because,  during the first days of January when this special commission  was created, many meetings were held in the conflict zone, as  well as in most tranquil municipalities. They toured the area  thoroughly, listening to and trying to understand concerns.    I believe Robledo Rincon will base his political platform on  the information he collected from the Indians and peasants  during these tours. This will be very important in this state,  where some politicians and some media have rightly pointed out  that whoever becomes governor will not necessarily be hitting  the jackpot.

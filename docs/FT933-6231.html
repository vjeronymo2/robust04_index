			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Property: Racing prospect falls in the selling stakes - Cadogan's Place HOUSE SALES completed in July showed a predictable seasonal decline from June levels, according to the Corporate Estate Agents Property Index, but the market is still gaining strength. Contracts exchanged in July for later settlement were at a peak for 1993, with a 3.2 per cent increase over June, and sales were 3.4 per cent up on July 1992 when the imminent ending of the chancellor of the exchequer's stamp duty holiday provided an artificial boost. Sensibly priced property will sell quickly to eager buyers. In the Cotswolds, the Old Forge at Windrush went recently for a little over the asking price of Pounds 190,000 (through Hurley Lloyd Thorpe, at Stow-on-the-Wold). The Lewes office of Strutt &amp; Parker sold two houses at East Hoathly, Sussex, for more than Pounds 400,000 on the same day: the Gate House (asking price over Pounds 425,000) and Spring Place (Pounds 395,000 for the house, with 37 acres extra). Further north, however, joint agents Blenkin, of York, and DTZ Debenham Thorpe, of Wetherby, report that the Hambleton House racing stables near Thirsk, Yorkshire, with 25 loose boxes and 175 acres of gallops where Noel Murless and Jack Calvert have trained, did not make the Pounds 400,000 asked. The stables will be back in business soon. CENTRAL LONDON has led the consolidation of the British property market since the pound was devalued on Black Wednesday in September last year and interest rates fell. Now, the market is suffering from a distinct lack of prime properties. This has, however, not stopped Lassmans from selling 6 Farm Street, Mayfair, near the Jesuit church, for near the asking price of Pounds 1.7m for a 95-year lease. The country market is more difficult. What is the right price for the handsome Buxted Park near Uckfield, East Sussex, now a country house hotel? The electrical trades union EEPTU bought the 1726, Grade II-listed mansion in 1987 for Pounds 6m for the use of its members and others. Before that, it had been a health hydro and the UK home of the ruler of Abu Dhabi. The EEPTU, now part of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, refurbished it lovingly and opened it as a country house hotel in 1989. But it started in difficult times. Buxted Park has yet to show a profit despite having conferences, a health club and all the conveniences guests/comrades could wish - such as a ballroom; private cinema holding 53; large, heated outdoor pool; park with a herd of fallow deer, and scintillating chandeliers. Inquiries to Savills (071-499 8644). LITERARY HOUSES put a gleam in agents' eyes. You never know who will apply. On the north side of Hyde Park, 46 Albion Street is a typical London terrace house with four floors, a garden, and a blue plaque in honour of the novelist William Makepiece Thackeray. It was his mother's and stepfather's house and he went to live there in 1837 with his bride Isabella (and, soon after, their child Anne). Chestertons Residential (071-262-5060) offers it for Pounds 525,000 freehold. LOVE LIFE in the Bloomsbury Group was more complicated. Savills in Ipswich (0473-226191) and Durrants of Halesworth (0986-873797) are selling the half-timbered Grange at Wissett, Suffolk, where Vanessa Bell lived in 1916 with David Garnett and Duncan Grant after separating from Clive Bell. Her sister, Virginia Woolf, wrote: 'Wissett seems to lull asleep all ambition - don't you think they have discovered the secret of life?' Available for Pounds 250,000. WOOLBEDING GLEBE near Midhurst, West Sussex, a splendid 1747-cum-1877 old rectory with a garden running down to the river Rother, has links to a minor Victorian literary figure. The Rev. Francis Bourdillon, author of 'The night has a thousand eyes' (in the Oxford Book of Victorian Verse), lived there as rector from 1855 to 1875. His successor enlarged the house, adding a substantial library. Now, it boasts a swimming pool as well. Set in glorious country (much of which is owned by the National Trust), Woolbeding Glebe is on sale from Jackson-Stops in Midhurst (0730-812357) for Pounds 1.25m. WESTWARDS, in Hampshire, Jane Austen and her brother Edward lived at Chawton, near Alton, from 1809. Her house on the estate belongs to the Jane Austen Memorial Trust and is open to the public but the big house, Chawton House, is in poor condition. Its sale last week (with the adjacent Old Manor House and 275 acres of park and farm land) to the Leonard X. Bosack and Bette M. Kruger Foundation of the US should, however, ensure its survival. The foundation will restore house and gardens as a centre for the study of women writers. The asking price with agent Humberts Leisure was Pounds 1.25m. ONE FAMILY has farmed at Wested Farm at Crockenhill, near Swanley, since 1908. Its 719 acres are 20 miles from London and a mile from the M25 and M20, Now arable, it used to be in fruit, vegetables and dairy cattle and could easily return to them. A tithe barn incorporates a cold store holding 80 tonnes and there are the necessary cottages and a farm manager's house. One of the lots is a ground let for Pounds 1 a year to the local football club. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (071-629-8171) looks for more than Pounds 2m for the property as a whole. THE FALL IN prices since the 1980s, cuts in interest rates and inflation, and higher earnings for people with jobs have made houses more affordable than for many years. One unexpected consequence, says the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, is that some buyers are ignoring the usual first step on the housing ladder - studios and one-bedroom flats. They are going straight to flats with two and three bedrooms and houses big enough for children. DO YOU FANCY your very own tax haven? Then try Brecqhou, which lies just off Sark, in the Channel Islands. It is 1,000 yards long, 600 yards wide and rises to 240 feet with a manor house, dower house, four cottages, paddocks, helicopter pad and small harbour. Supplies arrive by an aerial cable trolley from Sark, useful in bad weather. The price from Knight Frank &amp; Rutley and Lovell and Partners (0481-723 636) is over Pounds 3.5m (at least some of which surely could be recouped from the tax savings) and the new owner gets the whole 80-acre island. He also qualifies for a seat in the Chief Pleas, Sark's parliament, as well as joining its government (known as the Quarantine).</p>

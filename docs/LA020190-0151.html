CTK  did not give the reason for Pitra's resignation, which came a day after the  Communists ended 40 years of dominance in Parliament by giving more than 100 of  their seats to pro-democracy groups. The realignment completed an effort to  include those groups in Parliament before June 8 elections.  </P></p>

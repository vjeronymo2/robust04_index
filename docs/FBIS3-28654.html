			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Frank Longid Jr.] </F>   [Text] The National Democratic Front [NDF] wants to resume  exploratory talks with government provided a preliminary meeting  is held on issues the NDF wants to resolve before accepting the  invitation to meet with government representatives in Vietnam.    The NDF also insisted on the presence of exiled Communist  Party of the Philippines [CPP] founder Jose Ma. Sison during  talks with government. Although Fr. Luis Jalandoni is the NDF's  official representative, Sison -- who is believed to be the  current CPP chairman under the nom de guerre Armando Liwanag --  is recognized as a "consultant" of Jalandoni on the peace  process.    In a 22 January letter addressed to Ambassador Howard Dee,  chairman of the government panel dealing with the communist  rebels, Jalandoni stressed the need to "adequately resolve  certain matters of principle and procedure. The NDF is willing  to resume exploratory talks," Jalandoni wrote. However, he said  government must first "adhere to the Hague Declaration" and  remove the obstacles to the peace process.    Members of the panel and its working groups confirmed the  contents of the document but refused to discuss it further, as  well as the courses of action the panel is considering. Dee in  27 December accepted the NDF's invitation for a preliminary  meeting in Europe before holding further exploratory talks in  Vietnam. But he said the NDF must drop "their preconditions to  the exploratory talks."    In response, Jalandoni wrote "contrary to your allegations  that the NDF is making a precondition of EO [Executive Order]  125, it is Mr. Ramos who has thrown a monkey wrench into the  peace process by issuing EO 125." He added "any delay in the  NDF-GRP [Government of the Republic of the Philippines] talks is  ascribable to the Ramos regime's refusal to adhere to the letter  and spirit of the Hague Declaration, and setting up obstacles to  the peace process."    Jalandoni said the executive order is "a violation of the  Hague Declaration because it delimits the NDF-GRP talks to what  already appears in the existing GRP constitution." But Dee had  said that EO 125 cannot be rescinded because the order "in  effect creates the office of the peace process and also the  three panels (dealing with the country's rebel groups)."    In addition, a source in the panel explained that the EO  "does not necessarily delimit the talks...it is an internal  document and the NDF is not covered by it."    Jalandoni also denounced what he called "the Ramos regime's  continuing total war policy." But the source said the protest  was "uncalled for," claiming the firefights between government  troops and communist guerrillas have been declining steadily.  "Isa pa," [One more thing] he added, "aren't they the ones who  had earlier stated that we should conduct talks first before  declaring a cease-fire, that any cessation of hostilities should  come after the talks and not before?"    Jalandoni also claimed government "has been coddling (NDF)  renegades and expellees from the revolutionary movement." He  said this, along with "statements threatening to withdraw from  talks with the NDF and to hold peace talks with the renegades  and expellees," were all part of government's "psy-war" efforts.</p>

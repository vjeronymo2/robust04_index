			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Pakistan (16): Safer for users - What the new banking rules mean IN THEORY, a combination of new Prudential Regulations, combined with the government's aggressive push for deregulation, will produce a much safer but more competitive banking sector in Pakistan. In reality, says Mr Imtiaz Ahmed Hanafi, the State Bank of Pakistan governor, Pakistan is now over-banked and bankers are over-protected. But there is reason to believe that the system will be a significant improvement for depositors and borrowers. Pakistan's banking sector has had a tempestuous history. The arrival of a flood of new and privatised banks might prove an unbearable strain to an untried framework of regulations. But bankers argue that, if anything, the new regulations are even more stringent than those required by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). The State Bank has made the protection of deposit holders its principal requirement. The insistence that 40 per cent of banks' non-contingent liabilities be held in government bonds or cash provides substantial backing for depositors; it is also a useful way of constraining liquidity. The depositors deserve some reward. In recent years, government restrictions have made it unprofitable for banks to mobilise savings, while higher reward alternatives, such as the Co-operatives, have exposed savers to unlimited risk. Pakistan has one of the lowest saving rates in Asia, at 12 per cent of Gross Domestic Product. The figures are exaggerated by the existence of an active underground banking system, but the latest reforms should help suck more savings into the official economy. On the other side of the coin, banks will be under pressure to provide cheaper credit for a business sector in which the lack of competitive financing is seen as one of the main disadvantages of operating in Pakistan. The government is to start controlling bank lending through reserves rather than credit ceilings. Before, banks could lend only set amounts to different sectors, some of which was at enforced concessionary rates. Beyond those limits, any excess capital would have to be invested in government bonds paying a 6 per cent interest coupon, compared with lending rates of more than 14 per cent. The new Prudential Regulations restrict lending by reference to bank reserves and the quality of the borrower; while government securities are now sold by auction and have been issued at more than 13 per cent. Bankers complain that these are not free auctions, since the government has not always accepted the best bid, forcing a re-auction and thereby dictating market rates. But the returns have been substantially improved. These changes have been accompanied by increased competition, as part of the government push to deregulate the economy and encourage private sector expansion. Two of the banks that were nationalised in the Bhutto era of the 1970s have been re-privatised, while another two are due to follow shortly. A further 11 commercial banking licences have been issued, and the system is beefed up by 23 foreign banks, numerous investment banks, leasing companies and Modarabas, an Islamic hybrid between a leasing company and venture capital fund. The PRs should tighten the quality of loan portfolios and reduce the level of bad debt, while the deregulation should create a more competitive environment, aiding the process of private sector-driven economic development. This is not necessarily good for the banks, but it will put pressure on them to be more efficient. Of more concern to many bankers is how to work within a system where interest is against the edicts of Islam, and where it is impossible to anticipate the extent to which the government will go to stamp it out. Non-interest forms of banking in the local banking system were introduced in 1985. Under the current system, even foreign banks have to offer local depositors a profit and loss scheme, whereby the depositor gets a return based on the performance of the bank, like a preference shareholder. Loans are handed out on a similar basis of lender participation, although there is an alternative system of mark-up, whereby a bank buys a commodity from the borrower and sells it back at a higher price, with deferred payment arranged over a fixed period. Foreign bankers have adapted 'happily' to the new system, but are concerned about potential changes, following last November's Shariat Court decision that all interest was repugnant to Islam and that 22 economic laws must be invalidated. The court, which was introduced to ensure that the nation's laws conformed with the tenets of Islam, was also highly critical of the concept of mark-up. This has put significant pressure on the Government which has just made Islamic Law the supreme law of the land, but had diluted this by stating that no changes should be made to economic laws until a satisfactory alternative was found. The mixing of business and religion makes for an explosive cocktail, but the reaction among local bankers is relaxed. They say that privatisation and deregulation is the focus of this businessman's government, and Islamisation does not sit well on that agenda. Their conclusion is that everything will eventually change, but it will all remain effectively the same.</p>

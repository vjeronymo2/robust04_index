This program is being introduced to answer  questions raised by taxpayers on how to further implement the  new tax system. Now, I would like to introduce the leading  comrades who are here today. This is Comrade Chen Qingtai, vice  minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission, and this is  Comrade Zhang Zhongcheng, chief economist of the State General  Administration of Taxation. This is Comrade Jiang Qiangui,  director of the Enterprise Department of the State Economic and  Trade Commission. Now, I would like to ask Vice Minister Chen  Qingtai to speak during the first lecture.    [Chen] Viewers and comrades: To further study and publicize  the new tax system and new tax codes, and to promote a smooth  transition from the old tax system to the new one, the State  Economic and Trade Commission and the State General  Administration of Taxation are cosponsoring this program called  "Answers to Questions Regarding Enterprises' Implementation of  the New Tax System," with the assistance of China Central  Television Station. It is common knowledge that the current  reform of the tax system is of great intensity and covers a wide  range of areas; it is a major measure for our country to  establish macroeconomic regulation and control in a socialist  market economy. Generally speaking, the new tax system has been  implemented smoothly since it was introduced on 1 January, and  no major problems have arisen. In specific areas, however, we  have encountered one problem or another, and these problems  require further efforts on our part. The first concerns our  understanding of the new tax system. Some people, enterprises  included, do not quite understand the new tax system. For  example, they cannot clearly distinguish between taxes included  in the calculated prices and those not included in those prices.  They do not understand why the value-added tax should be  counted as one not included in the calculated prices. Moreover,  some problems have stemmed from distortions of the  implementation process. Some localities and enterprises, for  example, have not issued special invoices under various  pretexts, thereby increasing the burden on enterprises further  down the line in the taxation process. Also, the new tax system  is very rich in content, and some problems arising from  inadequate coordination exist in management and other specific  areas. Besides, some special businesses have incurred  additional tax burdens, and tax reduction and exemption policies  have been abolished for other businesses as a consequence of the  current reform of the tax system. These businesses find this  hard to accept. We should seriously study these problems and  solve them step by step.    It should be noted that the current reform of the tax system  is the sum total of sweeping and structural changes. Speaking  from the viewpoint of the state, we have the overall situation  under control by maintaining the total tax burden of enterprises  at the same level. Changes in tax categories, tax rates, tax  calculation methods, and taxation sectors, however, have  inevitably led to increased or decreased taxes for individual  enterprises. Enterprises should understand and absorb such  changes. Whether enterprises, which are the mainstay of our  country's economic construction and development, understand and  effectively implement the new tax system can affect the stable  development of our economy as a whole; it is also a basic  condition that determines whether our tax system can make the  transition smoothly. Hence, on the one hand, we should redouble  our efforts to publicize and study the new tax system so that  enterprises can have a more profound understanding of it; on the  other, we should constantly uncover and study problems, and  adopt timely measures to ensure the smooth implementation of the  new tax system. In dealing with people who take advantage of  tax reform to increase prices in order to make exorbitant  profits, the state should take action to mete out punishment, as  necessary, in accordance with the law, after conducting  inspections and exercising supervision. For their part,  enterprises should thoroughly study the new tax codes, master  the essence of those codes, and protect their legitimate rights  and interests in accordance with the new tax codes. Moreover,  enterprises should promptly bring to our attention, through  normal channels, the lack of convergence and coordination  between policies, laws, and regulations in the course of  implementing the new tax system, in order to facilitate the  solution of such problems.    Last year, we successively held three study classes for  factory directors and managers on reform of the tax system. We  studied and publicized the basic guidelines and major contents  of reform of the tax system, and achieved some results in this  respect. In holding those classes, we realized the problems  that enterprises might encounter in the course of reforming the  tax system, as well as problems that were of concern to them.  Moreover, enterprises have brought to our attention new  problems arising from this year's implementation of the new tax  system. Therefore, we decided, after discussion, to introduce  this special television program, to be presented in a  question-and-answer format, with the main purpose of answering  questions, in a single forum, concerning some problems that  enterprises have encountered in implementing the new tax system,  especially problems of a common nature. This will help people  better understand the new tax system and facilitate its  implementation. Besides, we are introducing this special  program to promote an in-depth study and implementation of the  new tax system nationwide.       [Xu] Well, now we will ask Chief Economist Zhang  Zhongcheng of the State General Administration of Taxation to  speak.    [Zhang] The new tax system to be implemented starting this  year is a relatively complete and profound reform in the history  of formulating the industrial and commercial tax system. It is  also a relatively big adjustment in the structure of the tax  system. The purpose of the current tax reform, to put it in  short, is to establish a tax system to cope with the need for  the development of a socialist market economy so as to better  promote a sustained, fast and healthy development of the  economy. The guiding principles for the current tax reform are  as follows: First of all, the principles are to unify the tax  law, levy tax in a fair manner, simplify the tax system,  reasonably divide the jurisdiction in taxation, straighten up  relations between the state and enterprises and between the  state and individuals, and guarantee the state's revenue income.  In the current reform of tax system, we have adhered to the  fundamental principle of strengthening the central authorities'  macrocontrol and whipping up the enthusiasm of both the central  authorities and localities. Second, they are to levy tax in a  fair manner to promote fair competition. Third, they are to  simplify the tax system. I think we should mention one more  important principle: that our current reform of tax system has  followed the principle of maintaining the original level of  total taxation of society on the subject of the tax burden. In  other words, we will not increase the aggregate amount of taxes  on enterprises because of the current reform of the tax system.  The state revenue income also will not be reduced because of  the reform of tax system. Basically, we will maintain the  original level of total taxation of society. However, in the  current reform, we have changed the tax rates by a great extent,  in relative terms. Accordingly, it is quite possible that,  among various enterprises, products and trade, the tax rate of  some of the enterprises will be reduced, the tax burden of some  of the enterprises will in the main remain the same, and the tax  burden of a small number of enterprises may increase somewhat as  compared with their tax burden before the reform. Therefore, on  this question, we should implement the State Council's  guidelines that those enterprises which will have a heavier tax  burden should strive to change their operational mechanism and  raise their own economic efficiency to absorb the relatively  greater tax burden due to tax reform. We can also say that the  increase of their tax burden will contribute to the entire  reform of the country.    The basic contents of the current reform are generally as  follows: The current reform, because of the relatively great  adjustment of the tax structure, will be a new issue for study  by the broad masses of people as well as the broad masses of  taxation cadres. So it is necessary to hold a  question-and-answer session on the new tax system.    Prior to answering questions, I wish to put forward some  requests: First, to the broad masses of taxation cadres and  taxation organizations at various levels: they must implement  the tax law in a strict manner, seriously and penetratingly  understand various problems in implementing the new tax system,  conduct investigation and study in a deep-going manner, promptly  and seriously solve all problems within the limit of tax law,  put forward their suggestions through investigation and study  for handling problems which cannot be solved by them and  promptly report those problems to their higher taxation  organizations up to the State General Administration of  Taxation. We will solve these problems if they are within our  power to do so. If we cannot solve these problems, we will  report them to and ask for instructions from the higher  leadership.       Second, I would like to make several demands on  taxpayers. 1) They must truthfully act in accordance with tax  laws. This is very important. They must truthfully file tax  returns and pay tax according to the regulations. 2) They must  promptly report to tax office problems in implementing tax laws;  their rational requests will be earnestly handled by the tax  office. At the same time, they must further study the new tax  provisions and, with the help and guidance of the tax office,  acquire a better understanding of the tax laws and successfully  implement them. 3) We also welcome people to raise questions to  ensure that with the help of people in all quarters, the new tax  system will be smoothly implemented.    [Xu] Chen Qingtai, vice minister of the State Economic and  Trade Commission, and Zhang Zhongcheng, chief economist of the  State General Administration of Taxation, have just explained  the purpose and significance of this program, as well as the  basics of the new tax law. Now, let us ask Jiang Qiangui,  director of the Enterprise Department of the State Economic and  Trade Commission, to briefly discuss the contents of the entire  program.    [Jiang] Viewers, let me brief you on the main contents of  this special television program: "Answers to Questions Regarding  Enterprises' Implementation of the New Tax System."

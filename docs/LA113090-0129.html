			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOXING AT THE IRVINE MARRIOTT;  </P> <P> CHAVEZ WHIPS YOUNG, BUT CAN'T FLOOR HIM  </P> <P> Ernie Chavez of Santa Ana won the vacant California welterweight title with a  10-round decision over Charles Young of Los Angeles Thursday night at the  Irvine Marriott.  </P> <P> Chavez bloodied Young's mouth in the first round, gave him a mouse under his  left eye in the third and sent him reeling in almost every round thereafter.  But Young wouldn't go down.  </P> <P> "He was like a Weeble, if you know what I mean," Chavez said.  </P> <P> Chavez wobbled Young in the fourth with a right-left-right combination. Young's  mouth was a bloody mess and he seemed to be teetering, but Chavez couldn't come  up with a knockout punch.  </P> <P> Young survived the best Chavez could dish out, going 10 rounds for the first  time in his career. Until Thursday, the farthest he'd gone was six.  </P> <P> Chavez gained his 13th victory and remained undefeated. Included among his  victories was a four-round decision over Young two years ago at Irvine.  </P> <P> Young fell to 8-4-2.  </P> <P> "I threw about 15 good punches," Chavez said. "I exaggerate, but I hit him with  some god-awful shots in the fourth."  </P> <P> In the later rounds, Chavez said he didn't mind taking Young's jab full-force  because it set up his overhand left to Young's head.  </P> <P> Chavez seemed to be more effective when Young was punching rather than running  and ducking.  </P> <P> "That guy has a bigger heart than we thought, that's for sure," Chavez said.  </P> <P> With his victory, Chavez joins a long line of champions trained by Jackie  McCoy, including Carlos Palomino, who was among the sellout crowd of 1,267.  </P> <P> In the early 1970s, Palomino was one of the founders of the Westminster Boxing  Club, where Chavez trains.  </P> <P> "I'm happy," Chavez said. "I just hope this will lead to something bigger and  better."  </P> <P> On the undercard, Ernie Magdalena of the Westminster Boxing Club scored a  third-round knockout of Aniello Crestenzo of Alhambra. Magdalena improved to  4-0 by wearing down a heavy-looking Crestenzo (1-1). Magdalena was introduced  at 175 pounds; Crestenzo 176.  </P> <P> Luis Mejia of Irvine scored a second-round knockout of Efren Sargent of  Ontario.  </P></p>

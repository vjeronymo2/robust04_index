			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWSPAPER PHOTOGRAPHER JACK D. MILLER DIES  </P> <P> Veteran newspaper photographer Jack D. Miller died of cancer Friday at  Placentia-Linda Community Hospital. He was 64.  </P> <P> Miller, a Santa Ana resident, worked for eight California newspapers, including  the Orange County Register, where he joined the staff as a photographer in  1968.  </P> <P> In recent years he managed the Register's photo processing laboratory. He also  worked for the Los Angeles Times, Garden Grove News, Long Beach Press-Telegram  and Bellflower Herald Enterprise.  </P> <P> Born Jan. 24, 1926, in Charleroi, Pa., Miller joined the Army Air Corps in 1941  and flew World War II bombing missions over Germany as a tail gunner in B-17  bombers.  </P> <P> "I really admired him," said Leonard Ortiz, a Register photographer who worked  with Miller for three years. "I did my internship here, and he was really  patient with me. Anything you needed, he would get it."  </P> <P> Patrick Tehan, a Register photographer for eight years, agreed.  </P> <P> "Jack was much loved by everyone on the staff," he said. "He could get you the  things you needed to do your job. If you were down, he would occasionally bring  in food, like a chocolate cake or a honey-baked ham, to cheer you up.  </P> <P> "He never asked for money or anything. He just made it available to the whole  staff."  </P> <P> Miller is survived by his wife, Dolores; a daughter, Kimberly J.  Miller-Hawthorne, and a son, Jack C. Miller, both of Corona; and a  granddaughter.  </P> <P> Another son and daughter, Michael Miller and Marla Miller, preceded him in  death.  </P> <P> Visitation will be from 5 to 9 p.m. Monday at Brown Colonial Mortuary in Santa  Ana.  </P> <P> Funeral services will be at 2 p.m. Tuesday at Trinity Lutheran Church in Santa  Ana.  </P></p>

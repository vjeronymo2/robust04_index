			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Flora Wong] </F>   [Text] Police abused their discretionary right to ban  petitions composed of unspecified materials during Sunday's  demonstration outside the Xinhua News Agency, representatives of  the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Patriotic Democratic  Movement in China said yesterday.    Police clashed with a small number of demonstrators outside  the Xinhua building when they tried to prevent Alliance members  from placing a wreath and a banner in front of the entrance. A  police spokesman defended their decision as one of "safety" and  "to minimise inconvenience to the public".    And Governor Chris Patten defended the police, saying they  behaved with a "good degree of tact." "These are not easy  matters for the police, but I think from all I've heard... they  behaved sensibly. Freedom of speech and freedom of assembly are  guaranteed under the Joint Declaration and we'll certainly do  everything we can before 1997 to ensure the foundations for  those freedoms are as secured as possible."    Alliance spokesman and United Democrat legislator Cheung  Man-kwong said bringing along items in addition to the letter  which was specified in the condition for the permit was a usual  practice. He said that last year the group set five flags in  front of the Xinhua building without any harassment from police.  Mr Cheung said he was told Xinhua had expressed unhappiness  over having items placed in front of its entrance. "The police  have used their discretion to bow to the authorities," he said.    Asked whether items used in petitions should be specified in  conditions for permits Mr Cheung said it would be "absurd" to go  into such detail.    A police spokesman said the primary concern was the safety  of  demonstrators the public. "Those attending processions and  demonstrations must heed police advice and directions for their  own safety and to minimise inconvenience to other members of the  public," he said.</p>

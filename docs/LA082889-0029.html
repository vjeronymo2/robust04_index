			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> INTERPRETATION KEY TO HOT SUMMERFEST  </P> <P> SummerFest '89 continues to surprise its Sherwood Hall audiences -- and for all  the right reasons. Some surprises have come from exotic repertory -- rare  specimens such as the recent Mel Powell opus String Quartet and Edward Elgar's  Piano Quintet. But even when the programming has not been that unusual, the  interpretations have consistently offered new insights into familiar music.  </P> <P> Friday night's concert to a full house of about 500 listeners provided two such  unexpected journeys.  </P> <P> Ravel's F Minor String Quartet, a staple of the quartet circuit, usually  receives a kid-glove approach that savors its translucent harmonies and hovers  over its delicate textures. In the hands of, say, the Tokyo String Quartet, the  piece borders on a precious parody of every flowery textbook definition of  musical Impressionism. Friday's Ravel offering was quite another matter.  </P> <P> Unlike an ensemble that has long worked together to produce a finely blended  sound, the four SummerFest string players do not regularly work together.  Violinists Masuko Ushioda and Julie Rosenfeld, and violist Toby Hoffman exhibit  strong, individual musical personalities, which gave both a less refined  texture and a far more energetic, vibrant interpretation of the piece. Bold,  animated, even angular describe the three fast movements.  </P> <P> In the Ravel piece's slow movement, Hoffman's luminous, sensual solo was  nothing less than a revelation. Second violinist Rosenfeld (she is the Colorado  String Quartet's first violin) played with equal bravura to Ushioda's  forthright lead. Only the overly proper -- almost aloof -- cellist Peter Reijto  failed to share this unusual but vigorous vision of the work.  </P> <P> Violinist Cho-Liang Lin made Beethoven's E-flat Piano Trio, Op. 70, No. 2, soar  with his simultaneously elegant and passionate playing. Lin's enthusiasm for  the work riveted this listener's attention from the first phrase. He was  well-partnered at the keyboard by David Golub, whose crisp, well-accented  realization of the score exploited its asymmetrical phrases and structure with  uncommon grace.  </P> <P> Cellist Ralph Kirshbaum shared this approach to the Beethoven composition, and  his phrasing admirably mirrored Lin's. But in contrast to Lin's ever-smiling  sonority, Kirshbaum rarely emerged from a labored grimace.  </P> <P> Between the Beethoven Trio and the Ravel Quartet, five SummerFest wind players  gave Hindemith's Kleine Kammermusik, Op. 24, No. 2, an emotionally restrained  but engaging performance, one that refuted the work's reputation as a relic of  well-crafted neoclassical carpentry.  </P> <P> On most programs, this reading would have been exemplary, especially with  bassoonist Dennis Michel's plaintive declamations and flutist Damian  Bursill-Hall's deftly sculpted lines. (The other players were oboist Allan  Vogel, clarinetist David Peck and Richard Todd, French horn.)  </P> <P> Friday night, however, it was diminished by its stellar company.  </P></p>

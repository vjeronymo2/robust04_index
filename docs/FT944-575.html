			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Glossary Discount: Investment trust shares traditionally sell for less than their underlying asset value. The gap between the two is known as the discount. In the 1974 bear market, discounts were as wide as 45 per cent and although they have mainly narrowed to well under 10 per cent in recent years, they add an additional uncertainty to investment trust share price prospects. The sharp narrowing of the discount is another reason why investment trusts look better than unit trusts on longer-term comparisons. Peps: Some, but not all, unit and investment trusts can be put into a general personal equity plan which shields investors against both income and capital gains tax. The Pep rules are that you can put Pounds 6,000 into a general Pep (and a further Pounds 3,000 into a single company Pep). To qualify for the full Pounds 6,000 general Pep allowance, a minimum of 50 per cent of a plan's assets must be held in European Union shares. A trust which has more overseas investment, but is still 50 per cent invested in shares, is non-qualifying and limited to a Pep content of Pounds 1,500. Performance: Tables like these are full of traps for the unwary. Trap 1: don't expect them to tell you which trusts will do best in future - they are merely a historic record. Trap 2: don't make minute comparisons of unit and investment trusts - the unit trust figures take account of the spread between buying and selling prices; the investment trust ones take mid-market prices in both cases. So comparisons flatter investment trusts. Volatility: Shows the absolute variability of a trust's performance. As a rule of thumb, the more volatile a fund's progress, the higher the return investors demand from it to compensate for the additional risk. Unusually volatile funds should be avoided by anyone investing over the short or medium term or those who cannot afford big losses. But investors who can afford to take a long-term view may want to have some high risk/high reward trusts in their portfolio to spice it up. Yield: Even this has traps for the unwary. Most unit trusts charge their management expenses against income, so the yield is net of expenses. But a recent rule change means that trusts are allowed to charge some or all of their management expenses to capital, thus inflating the yield. Our managed funds pages identifies those trusts which charge to capital. Investment trusts used all to charge expenses against income, but some now charge some against capital. Split capital trusts: Caveat emptor. If you do not already know what they are, you would probably be wiser to avoid them. They are companies with more than one class of share capital. The traditional variety is relatively simple: income shares get all the income; capital shares get any capital growth over the life of the trust. But nowadays splits are highly complex with several different types of security with differing rights, and aimed to satisfy different investment needs.</p>

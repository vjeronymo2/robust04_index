			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / International Company News: Eni chief says group is on the way to recovery Eni, the Italian state-owned energy and chemicals group, expects to report earnings at 'about break-even' for 1993 after losing L815bn (Dollars 485m) in the previous year. The result could be affected by unforeseen contracts and the sharp fall in oil prices in recent months, warned Mr Franco Bernabe, managing director. However, he expressed confidence that Eni was on the way to recovery. He said prospects for 1994 were even better, as Eni would benefit from the restructuring programme begun last year. The 1992 loss reflected about L1,500bn in extraordinary items, largely linked to the group's current reorganisation and disposal programme. While the 1994 results would also be affected by restructuring costs, the burden would be appreciably lighter, he said. Eni 'still has a lot to do on restructuring, but there will be fewer costs involved'. Efforts to slim down the group, embroiled in Italy's political corruption scandal, would continue, with further asset disposals, especially in non-core businesses. Eni should shortly announce the sale of its big Nuovo Pignone turbines subsidiary, with General Electric tipped as the front runner. Mr Bernabe said he hoped the disposal of Il Giorno, Eni's Milan-based daily newspaper, might be completed by mid-1994. However, he quashed suggestions that Eni might take a stake in the French Elf group, to be privatised next year, as part of a long-term share swap between the two concerns. He said such rumours were completely without foundation. Recent reports, nourished by Italian ministers, have suggested the French could take a reciprocal stake in Eni's energy interests, due to be privatised by the end of 1995. However, Mr Bernabe said: 'It seems strange to me to talk about a share swap between an entity which exists and one which doesn't exist.'</p>

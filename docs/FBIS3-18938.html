			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by correspondents Luis R. Aizpeolea and Anabel </F> Diez]    [Text] Felipe Gonzalez is paying the price for having  formed "too technocratic" a government. Gonzalez admitted as  much Friday [11 February] during a rare, unscheduled news  conference following the Council of Ministers--he had not called  one in the last four years--and noted that although he had not  called it for any special reason he intends to do it more often  in the future. Gonzalez has told his close advisers to step up  public appearances to make up for the invisibility of his  government. He thinks that over the last seven months the  cabinet has done a great many things, but has failed to get the  message to the people.    Gonzalez and his advisers understand that as long as the  economic situation does not improve, neither will popular  perceptions of the work accomplished by his government, which at  times seems very little. But the invisible government that  Gonzalez put together in July has not made the task of allaying  that impression any easier.    Gonzalez respects his ministers but has concluded they have  only limited capacity to articulate and communicate the kind of  political message which, in a time of recession and political  complexity, is more essential than ever. Controversy over the  alliance with the Catalonian nationalists, divisions among the  socialists, and the confrontation with the unions are some of  the most serious problems the prime minister has had to face.    Problems have been exacerbated by the absence from the  Council of Ministers of two heavy hitters on whom Gonzalez was  counting: Carlos Solchaga and Jose Luis Corcuera. The two highly  combative ministers gave the government a certain gravitas it  now lacks. Their replacements, Economy Minister Pedro Solbes,  and Interior Minister Antoni Asuncion, have the image of  technocrats.  <H5>  Serra's Role </H5>   Nor does Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra present the  appearance of a political heavyweight, and tensions in the  cabinet's bicephalous leadership--more specifically between  Antoni Zabalza and Jose Enrique Serrano--only make matters  worse. Serra too has become concerned about the government's  lack of political visibility and has turned to making more  frequent appearances in parliament.    "In this government, there is only one minister with an  established political image: Jose Borrell, minister for public  works and transportation. There is another one, Foreign Affairs  Minister Javier Solana, but he maintains a low profile owing to  his intense dedication to international policy. There is a third  who is a politician but doesn't act like one: Minister of  Industry Juan Manuel Eguiagaray," according to high level  officials in the prime minister's office.    Political debate is also virtually absent from meetings of  the Council of Ministers. That body cedes absolute authority to  Felipe Gonzalez, who is never contradicted. Nonetheless, out of  political necessity the head of government last month opened two  debates in the lower house--one on the 27 January general  strike, and the other on the conflict between the Constitutional  Tribunal and the Supreme Court.    "The problem is not so much whether things are debated,  which  hardly matters. The problem is the political stature of the  ministers, which is low. The majority of the better ministers  are not politicians," say highly placed sources in the  administration. Economy Minister Solbes and Defense Minister  Julian Garcia Vargas are good examples.    Then there are some ministers who make frequent public  appearances but without any political impact. Several  independent cabinet members, including Cultural Affairs Minister  Carmen Alborch and Commerce and Tourism Minister Javier Gomez  Navarro, are clear examples of this type.    The refreshing whiff of novelty which Felipe Gonzalez sought  when he named these independents has faded. Curiously, the woman  who seven months ago was least known among the independents,  Health Minister Angeles Amador, has managed her portfolio with  remarkable effectiveness.    In this gray landscape, the work done by Alfredo Perez  Rubalcaba, head of the prime minister's office, as spokesman for  the government is insufficient, despite his efforts and growing  influence. "His visibility, though necessary, is not sufficient  to establish the government's political presence," say sources  in the prime minister's office.    Various social strata are reacting in different ways to this  lack of public visibility. In a recent statement on behalf of an  association of manufacturers of equipment goods, Jose Maria  Vizcaino, former head of the Basque employers' association,  criticized the government's lack of leadership. In times of  crisis, he said, people need something to hold onto, leadership  that inspires confidence, and visibility--and government is  falling down in this area. Another business leader, Enrique  Kaibel, was surprised and appreciative when a politician, in  this instance the undersecretary for public works, Antoni  Llarden, attended a businessmen's function in Valencia.  <H5>  Role of Luck </H5>   The government is pinning its political hopes on success in  ending the economic recession. The prime minister is gambling  that within a year people will see new jobs appearing and  realize the recession is almost behind them.    If this does not happen, chances of the government  continuing  beyond the municipal and autonomous elections in spring of 1995  would be remote. "This is the biggest problem we face as we run  the obstacle course that lies ahead," say sources in the  government.    Meanwhile, the prime minister's advisers seem relatively  satisfied with the work accomplished over the eight months the  government has been in power. During this time, it has  maintained a parliamentary majority in the face of various  unpleasant "shocks" thanks to support from the Catalonian  nationalists.    The biggest problem with the alliance policy has been one of  image--a failure to overcome suspicions fueled by the opposition  that the pacts with CiU [Convergence and Union] involved  offsetting concessions and would compromise the country's  territorial integrity.    Another recent government success is to have diffused, only  two weeks after the general strike, the event's impact on public  opinion. The strategy of nonconfrontation with the unions,  developed by the prime minister's office, has had an effect. Its  success is all the more impressive considering that the prime  minister in recent months has been forced to adopt a whole  series of "unpopular and necessary" measures such as labor  reform and a wage freeze on government workers.    What with needed legislation, sectoral measures such as the  important health package, and progress on the democratic and  autonomous communities agendas, the government, at least in its  own estimation, has been running in "high gear" and getting more  done than the previous legislature.</p>

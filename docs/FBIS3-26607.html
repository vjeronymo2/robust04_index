Premier Lien made the remarks during his year-end news  conference at the Government Information Office. Lien took  office in February last year.    "The life of a politician is short, but the life of the  nation is forever," Lien said, asking the mainland leaders to be  ever mindful of the future development for all of China.    If the Chinese Communists continue to take the zero-sum  approach to debase Taiwan, treating Taiwan as a renegade  province, then unification of this kind will be called  "annexation," Lien declared.    "The One-China policy is the nation's fundamental policy,  but  this China is currently divided," Lien said. "The Republic of  China is a sovereign nation founded in 1912, but currently the  ROC rules only reach Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu."    Lien added, "Realistically speaking the discussion of the  sovereignty issue should be put aside at the present stage when  considering the issues relating to foreign affairs and mainland  policy."    The so-called transitional Two-Chinas policy declared by  Economics Minister Chiang Pin-kung during the Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation summit conference in Seattle last fall was  not a change of the government's mainland policy but was meant  only to point out the reality existing between the two sides,  Lien said.    The relationship between Taiwan and mainland are that of  siblings, not enemies," Lien told some 100 local and foreign  reporters. "There is no real animosity between Chinese people  of the two sides, and together we can create a future of  freedom, security and prosperity."    But until Beijing authorities abandon their hostility,  Taipei  would not consider opening the so-called "three communications"  -- direct trade, mail and transportation across the Taiwan  Strait, the premier indicated.    Last December, Economics Minister Chiang said the government  should lift the ban to allow direct sea links between Taiwan and  the mainland between certain designated cities and harbors to  reduce transportation costs.    But Lien said yesterday the time is not ripe to deal with  such a complex issue from a purely economic angle.    Beijing will first need to show its sincerity by recognizing  Taipei as a separate political unit, Renouncing the use of  military force against Taiwan and halting a campaign to isolate  Taiwan in the international arena, Lien said.    The government will continue to regulate Taiwan investment  on  the mainland based on the National Unification Guidelines,  according to Lien, who said he does not think the economic  activities should be separated from politics.</p>

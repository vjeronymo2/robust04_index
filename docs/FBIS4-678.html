			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 14 SAPA -- Constitutional  Development Minister Roelf Meyer was meeting international  mediator Henry Kissinger for talks on Thursday [14 April]  morning aimed at salvaging the embattled mediation process. Mr  Meyer's meeting was one of several being held with the mediators.    Mr Meyer would not be drawn on what his meeting was about,  but the parties are trying to settle their differences on the  terms of reference so that mediation can get underway.    The international mediation forum said in a statement that  mediators were still in contact with the parties. They have  apparently given the parties until lunchtime on Thursday to  settle their differences on the terms of reference.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sorin Rosca-Stanescu: "The Interior Ministry's </F> Hot News"]    [Text] A shocking element has emerged in the scandal of  the generals: We finally have proof of the existence in  Romania, beginning 26 March 1993, of an official (but illegal)  and particularly well-organized surveillance network for  political purposes of party and trade union leaders, public  figures, journalists, foreign citizens, and Romanians traveling  abroad, aimed at monitoring and reporting daily on the mood of  the population and infiltrating the Diaspora.    The entire system characteristic of the political police has  been organized by the UM 0215 -- the secret service of the  Ministry of Interior [MI]. Under the leadership of the former  interior minister, George Ion Danescu, and his close aide,  General Dan Gheorghe, a few days ago still the chief of the UM  0215 Secret Service, a comprehensive and extremely precise work  method was drafted, which is compulsory for all regional  intelligence services. This method, which we possess,  constitutes an indubitable proof that top officials in the  Ministry of Interior have initiated the most flagrant violation  of the Constitution and the country's laws, thus seriously  jeopardizing our citizens' freedom. We want to specify that all  information obtained from this extensive network of agents is  entered on a daily basis in the computer of the Romanian  Intelligence Service [SRI]. Then this information is used for  political purposes. Thus, SRI is doing its dirty work with the  help of the secret service of the Ministry of Interior. The  astonishing thing is that a parliamentary commission (which  checked unit 0215 some two months ago) discovered a number of  irregularities, but failed to discover the essential thing. The  secret of this monster within the Ministry of Interior has been  carefully preserved so far.    The espionage affair in which Lieutenant General Marin  Pancea, counselor to President Ion iliescu and secretary of the  country's Defense Council, was allegedly involved and the  dismissals of Major General Gh. Diaconescu, chief of the SRI  Espionage Department, and of General Dan Gheorghe, chief of the  UM-0215 within the Ministry of Interior, as well as the  espionage affair made public by Traian Basescu, at the end of  which is General Grylakis [involved in Romanian fleet sale  scandal], seem to be linked by certain threads but also through  mysterious rivalries at the top executive level.    Until the situation as a whole is clarified, we will reveal  to the public the following details about the most serious  political espionage case after 1989. If an earthquake will be  triggered in the Ministry of Interior and the SRI, and in  Romanian society on the whole, ending with the main protagonists  on the accusation bench, then this means that Romania still has  a chance to improve.  <H5>  Secret Work Method </H5>   Here are the things with which the Intelligence Department  of  the Ministry of Interior -- UM-0215 -- dealt beginning 26 March  1993 (when Circular No. 00608801 was officially and secretly  disseminated). We will now summarize some of the compulsory  objectives pursued by the agents at home and abroad:    "1. Actions against national security; 2. Nationalist,  irredentist, separatist, and racial actions; 3. Actions  regarding the physical life and security of Romanian and foreign  citizens whose security falls within the competence of the  Ministry of Interior (so far nothing abnormal, the above  activities being legal); 4. Specific information about  antiterrorist actions (a strange activity because there is a  specialized antiterrorist unit attached to the SRI, while,  through the nature of things, the Watch and Protection Service  (SPP) performs such activities); 5. Foreign citizens' actions;  6. Romanian citizens actions (and in this connection we will  reproduce and specify certain aspects of the secret work method  clearly revealing what 0215 actually pursued: `F. 63 --  attitudes, positions, assessments; F. 38 -- went abroad for  specialization; F. 39 -- studied abroad; F. 40 -- went abroad  for specialized assistance.'" Above I have outlined certain  typical activities of the political police. And now further  details). 7. Specific essentials regarding state and  professional interests; 8. Specific essentials of the activity  of information protection; 9. Essentials regarding antecedents;  10. Specific essentials regarding operative information about  Romanians abroad. (And again some information about the method  regarding these "essentials": "F. 12 -- employed at foreign  missions or foreign branches in Romania; F. 81 -- temporarily  resident abroad; F. 101 -- possession of funds; F. 107 -- people  holding dual citizenship.")    We hope that our readers realize how extensive and dangerous  this network is, which has been set up under the guidance of the  generals from the secret unit of the Ministry of Interior.  Circular No. 00608801 is signed by deputy directors -- Colonel  Marica, Colonel Condoiu, and Colonel Stan.    We also want to specify that following dispositions issued  for all regional units in a secret radiogram in May 1993, the  information obtained by this network is no longer passed on to  regional chiefs, but is necessarily entered in the SRI computer.  We doubt that the opposition parties have access to the data  obtained in this way. Sealing the mechanism whereby the  Ministry of Interior is gradually being subordinated to the SRI,  a decision was made whereby no one can be employed in the  Ministry of Interior, without the agreement of the institution  headed by Virgil Magureanu.    We are waiting for the reaction of parliamentarians.</p>

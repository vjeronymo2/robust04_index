			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Survey of Korean Financial Markets (7): Sector on tenterhooks ahead of proposals - Financiers await the most important phase of liberalisation THE Korean financial sector is holding its breath. Proposals to be unveiled next month could radically alter the shape of the system, but uncertainty remains about how far-reaching the changes will be and when they will be completed. The steps to be announced in December are the last - and the most important  -of the three-stage financial liberalisation blueprint that the Ministry of Finance (MOF) has been preparing this year. The MOF agreed to produce a schedule of measures after President George Bush's visit to South Korea in January. The US, Seoul's closest ally, has been pushing for financial liberalisation to improve investment prospects for foreign companies in South Korea. The first two phases, unveiled in March and June, consist of measures designed to allow foreign financial institutions greater access to the Korean market. However, these reforms, which will take effect between now and 1996, will have only a limited impact on the structure of the Korean financial system since they are concerned with relatively minor issues. Included are measures making it easier for foreign banks - which face restrictions on bringing capital into the country - to raise local currency funds in the domestic market. The amount of certificates of deposits that foreign banks can issue locally is being increased and foreign banks will be given equal treatment in the interbank market. A reduction in foreign exchange restrictions is also being introduced to improve access to funds. Limits on foreign exchange positions of banks will be eased, while the band for exchange rate fluctuations is being widened. These measures are expected to lead to the internationalisation of the Korean Won. It is the third set of long-term measures, scheduled for implementation after 1997, that deal with the fundamental principles of the current tightly-regulated system. The issues include: Full-scale interest rate deregulation, which provides the foundation for other financial liberalisation measures. The government has already started to deregulate interest rates in four stages, a process that is expected to be completed by the end of the century. Long-term rates will be deregulated before short-term ones, while lending rates will be freed before deposit rates. All interest rates on loans will be fully liberalised by 1996, while 70 per cent of deposit rates will also be freed. The final stage, from 1997, will lift the regulation of short-term demand deposit rates and interest rates on government and public bonds. Deregulation is expected eventually to reduce interest rates, which are now higher than those of Korea's main trade competitors. It will also end the practice of 'policy loans' which banks must grant at below-market rates to industries deemed strategic by the government. Policy loans account for 45 per cent of total bank credit and have contributed to the banks' bad-debt problems. The liberalisation of capital transfers into and out of Korea. This will give Korean companies greater access to international capital markets and reduce their borrowing costs, while promoting increased foreign investment. The Ministry of Finance now regulates tightly which Korean companies can borrow from abroad. The abolition of credit allocation controls. Banks are now required to provide at least 35 per cent of their total lending to small and medium businesses, while they face restrictions on lending to big business groups. Financial market deregulation. The stock market opened to limited direct foreign investment at the start of this year. Controls are also being lifted on the domestic bond market, with foreign participation scheduled to take place after 1997. There are plans to establish a commodity and financial futures market. Korea needs better developed financial markets to improve its open market mechanisms governing monetary policy. Although the MOF is committed in principle to achieving these long-term goals, questions still remain about the effects of the liberalisation programme on the financial system. Decisions will be guided by the Korean preference for a financial system similar to that of Japan, where it is considered an instrument for guiding industrial policy. Thus the MOF recommendations may disappoint supporters of a more market-led Anglo-American financial system. The Korean government might try to retain influence over the financial system by continuing to restrict the independence of the Bank of Korea, the central bank, and influencing the appointment of senior bank executives. Another factor that will affect the outcome of financial liberalisation is the future ownership structure of the domestic banks, which have been the main tools of government control of the financial system. The Federation of Korean Industries wants the government to allow the big industrial conglomerates, or chaebol, to become main shareholders in the commercial banks. It argues that chaebol ownership would promote competition within the banking industry and enhance management efficiency. It would also extend the chaebol's ownership over a large share of Korea's financial institutions. Bank ownership is now fragmented, with no individual shareholder being allowed more than a 8 per cent stake. The dispersed ownership of the banks allows the government to retain influence over the banking sector in spite of its privatisation in the late 1980s. The government consequently will resist the chaebol ownership of banks. Instead, it hopes the banks will take control of other financial institutions and reduce the chaebol's power. Another unknown factor is the question of when the financial liberalisation programme will be completed since the government has given an open-ended deadline. 'We know the key structural changes will start in 1997, but we fear they could take as long as a decade or two to complete,' said a US official. The MOF has set economic preconditions for introducing the third-stage reforms since it fears rapid deregulation could cause economic instability. It wants Korea to maintain a consistent current account surplus. Inflation must fall to 5 per cent, while the differential between domestic and international interest rates should narrow to 2 to 3 per cent. The foreign financial community is concerned about whether economic targets can be achieved without introducing some of the third-stage reforms. 'It's a chicken-or-egg situation,' said one US banker. But a recent improvement in economic performance is bringing those targets within sudden reach. The current account deficit could shrink to Dollars 5.6bn from Dollars 8.7bn in 1991. Inflation is expected to fall to 6.6 per cent for the year, while the interest rate gap is narrowing. The improved economy and pressure from international financial advisors, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, could eventually force the government to accelerate financial liberalisation.</p>

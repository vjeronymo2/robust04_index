			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / French right claims success in local polls Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, was last night anxiously awaiting the final outcome of the first round of voting in France's local council elections after exit polls suggested that his centre-right coalition had won a majority of the votes. The centre-right won 44.3 per cent of the votes, according to a BVA poll for France Television, leaving the left, which triumphed when the same seats were contested six years ago, with 42.1 per cent. A Sofres poll for the TF1 television station gave the government parties a larger lead with 46 per cent, against 40 per cent for the socialists and commun ists. Yesterday's poll, which encompassed 2,018 of France's 4,033 local council seats, was the first significant test of confidence in Mr Balladur's centre-right government since its election in March last year. It has come at a critical time for Mr Balladur, whose popularity has slipped recently on concern about high unemployment and a wave of violent strikes and demonstrations. Mr Balladur, whose capable manner made him one of Europe's most popular politicians during his first months in office, has seen his approval rating fall from 55 per cent to around 50 per cent since the end of last year. The prime minister, tipped as a contender for the centre-right candidacy in next spring's presidential elections, desperately needs a vote of confidence in the local vote which will be concluded with a second round of voting next Sunday. Mr Charles Pasqua, the hard-line interior minister who was a candidate in yesterday's vote, declared the result a 'success for the government' pointing out that its share of the vote was 'slightly higher' than in the 1988 local elections and more than in the 1993 legislative elections. However Mr Michel Rocard, the socialist leader, was swift to highlight the narrowness of the government's lead. Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, head of the extreme-right wing National Front, described his party's 10 per cent of the votes as 'a very good result'. Yesterday's vote included the local council seats which were last contested in 1988. France swung to the left during that year with the socialists triumphing in the parliamentary elections and winning an extra 89 seats in the local vote. The left has since lost support culminating in its crushing defeat in last spring's parliamentary elections. Opinion polls last week predicted that the Balladur centre-right coalition, which already controls 75 of France's 95 conseils generals or general councils, would win up to 200 extra seats after next Sunday's second round. The polls also forecast that the centre right eventually emerge with majorities of another eight conseils generaux thereby bringing the total under its control to 83 regions.</p>

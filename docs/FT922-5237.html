			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Observer: For whom the poll tells Although she'd probably prefer not to know it, Margaret Thatcher now stands on a par with Karl Marx. Or so say the Russians lately polled by their country's Centre for the Study of Public Opinion. Mind you, neither of the two ranks very high in the Russians' list of the world's greatest figures. They tie for 15th place in a league still headed by Lenin even though the proportion of people nominating him is down from 67 per cent last year to only 43. The only foreigner in the top 10 is Albert Einstein. The Centre's sociologist Leonid Sedov says most indicators show worsening chauvinistic attitudes among the various ethnic groups in the former Soviet Union. The Russians' greatest dislike is for the peoples of the Caucasus; then come Jews and Chechens; followed by Central Asians, the Baltic peoples and finally the Ukrainians and Belorussians. The attitudes of other groups to the Russians vary widely. Whereas Central Asians think them cultured and clever, for instance, the Baltic peoples regard them as the opposite. In Sedov's view, while the feared force of Russian nationalism is growing, it is still relatively mild. External onlookers, however, may have qualms about the rising popularity of Stalin. With a gain from 15 to 22 per cent over the past year, he now stands third in the ranking.</p>

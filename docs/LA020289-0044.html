			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A Polish prosecutor ruled out suspicion of murder in the case of a  pro-Solidarity priest found dead in his apartment this week. Citing a  preliminary investigation, prosecutor Tadeusz Sabat said that Father Stanislaw  Suchowolec, 30, was asphyxiated when an electric heater set fire to a carpet.  In Warsaw, a church official concurred. "There are still a lot of questions,  but to a great extent one can say the (electric) stove caused the fire," Father  Cezary Potocki said. Suchowolec's death, in the city of Bialystok, provoked  controversy because another pro-Solidarity priest, Father Stefan Niedzielak,  74, was found dead of a broken neck Jan. 21. The government said the inquiry  into the latter's death is continuing.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on Sections 27.952(c) and 29.952(c) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter believes that the proposed amendments mandate self-sealing breakaway couplings and suggests that the amendments be revised to include the words ``Where hazardous relative motion of fuel system components is likely to exist during a crash, breakaway self-sealing couplings shall be required.'' Another commenter suggests that no alternate, equivalent designs to breakaway fuel fittings be allowed by the amendments. A third commenter points out that there is no mention of any pull-out strength requirements for fuel tank fittings as stated in MIL&hyph;T&hyph;27422B. The amendments already express the intent of the wording suggested by the first commenter concerning hazardous relative motion. Further, the FAA does not agree with the second comment that alternate, equivalent designs to breakaway fuel fittings should not be allowed, since several proven, alternate, equivalent designs have already been approved. Thus, alternate, equivalent designs for breakaway fuel fittings are acceptable. In response to the third commenter, fitting strength and hose pull-out strength requirements of MIL&hyph;T&hyph;27422B are industry practice and are acceptable as one means of compliance. Therefore, the amendments are adopted as proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on Sections 27.952(c)(1)(iii) and 29.952(c)(1)(iii) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter suggests that &sect;&sect;27.952(c)(2)(iii) and 29.952(c)(1)(iii) be changed to specify leakage as one method of detecting an unlocked or otherwise faulty breakaway coupling. The FAA agrees that leakage is one method of detecting an unlocked coupling but finds that the proposed wording of ``design provisions to visually ascertain'' adequately covers consideration of leakage as a means to verify locking of the couplings. Therefore, the amendments are adopted as proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on Sections 27.952(c)(1)(v) and 29.952(c)(1)(v) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter suggests that &sect;&sect;27.952(c)(1)(v) and 29.952(c)(1)(v) be changed to allow ``fuel seepage'' after a breakaway coupling has performed its intended function. The FAA agrees with the intent of the comment but has determined that this kind of detail is more appropriate in advisory guidance material. It is intended that industry practice, which allows loss of entrapped fuel (up to 8 ounces) and fuel seepage (up to 5 drops per minute), be acceptable after the valve has functioned. Therefore, the amendments are adopted as proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on Sections 27.952(d) and 29.952(d) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter suggests adding a sentence between the second and third sentences of &sect;&sect;27.952(d) and 29.952(d) as follows: ``For tanks using a flexible tank or flexible liner, all filler caps and tank fittings attached to structure in locations of anticipated structural deformation must be frangibly attached such that the tank fittings and filler caps stay with the fuel tank to preclude tank ruptures after the frangible separation.'' The FAA agrees with the intent of this comment but finds that no change is necessary in the final rule. The FAA understands the commenter is suggesting that compliance methodology rather than objective substance be included in the rule. Therefore, the amendments are adopted as proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on Sections 27.952(d)(1) and 29.952(d)(1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter suggests that the FAA remove the second sentence from &sect;&sect;27.952(d)(1) and 29.952(d)(1), which reads as follows: ``To prevent inadvertent separation or deformation, the load must be 10 times the normal service loads at the frangible or deformable attachment location.'' The FAA recognizes the large variance in industry design practice in calculating this particular ratio and in setting its specific value. Accordingly, the FAA agrees with the commenter, and the sentence is removed from the final rule. Therefore, these amendments are adopted as revised. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on Sections 27.952(e)(1) and 29.952(e)(1) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter states that the proposed &sect;&sect;27.952(e)(1) and 29.952(e)(1) criteria largely repeat existing criteria. The commenter provides several specific examples of the perceived repetition. Another commenter asks why airframe mounted fuel filters are not acceptable in the engine compartment (i.e., fire zone) if engine mounted filters are acceptable. The FAA maintains that the proposed sections relate to a post-crash configured rotorcraft, that is radically different in terms of ignition sources, fuel leaks, and geometry than a pre-crash configured rotorcraft even though similarities may exist. Prior to these proposed amendments, parts 27 and 29 applied only to pre-crash (or flight) configured rotorcraft. Also, the proposed sections refer to the entire rotorcraft, not just specific zones, such as the pre-crash configured exhaust system regulations that were cited by the commenter in a particular example. However, because of this and other related comments, the FAA has decided to simplify the final rule by deleting the proposed subsections relating to compliance methodology and moving the term ``occupiable areas'' from proposed paragraphs e(4) to revised paragraphs (e). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the comment concerning the use of airframe mounted fuel filters, the FAA agree that airframe mounted fuel filters, as well as engine mounted fuel filters inside the engine fire zone, are acceptable. Therefore, &sect;&sect;27.952(e) and 29.952(e) are adopted as revised; and &sect;&sect;27.952(e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3), (e)(4); 29.952(e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3) and (e)(4) are deleted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on Sections 27.952(e)(4) and 29.952(e)(4) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter states that the existing rules are adequate to ensure sufficient PCF protection for fuel tanks located near occupiable areas. Therefore, from a practical view, sufficient separation cannot be economically achieved to the extent that it would have a significant impact on preventing a PCF. Thus, the commenter suggests that &sect;&sect;27.952(e)(4) and 29.952(e)(4) be removed. In contrast, the FAA believes that it is practical to enhance PCF safety through design changes under proposed &sect;&sect;27.952(e)(4) and 29.952(e)(4). For example, moving a fuel cell an additional 1/4 or more inches aft of an occupied volume (within the maximum practicable extent of a given design envelope) could avoid a major, occupant-drenching, post-crash fuel spill (and potential PCF). This could be accomplished by simply adding 1/4 or more inches of crushable, energy absorbing airframe distance between the occupied volume and the fuel cell. Such a design decision would not need to be considered under the current standards. Under these proposals it would have to be considered. As stated previously, &sect;&sect;27.952(e)(4) and 29.952(e)(4) have been removed in order to simplify the final rule by deleting the compliance methodology. However, the requirement for separation of fuel tanks from occupiable areas is adopted in &sect;&sect;27.952(e) and 29.952(e). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on Sections 27.952(e) and 29.952(e)(5) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Three commenters correctly observe that &sect;&sect;27.952(e)(5) and 29.952(e)(5) contained the incorrect reference, ``*&blank;*&blank;* (as defined by paragraph (b) of this section) *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The FAA agrees. As stated previously, &sect;&sect;27.952(e)(5) and 29.952(e)(5) have been removed in order to simplify the final rule by deleting the compliance methodology. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on Sections 27.952(e)(6) and 29.952(e)(6) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter states that, under his interpretation, proposed &sect;&sect;27.952(e)(6) and 29.952(e)(6) would require firewalls to retain their sealing ability under the load factors of &sect;&sect;27.952(b)(1) and 29.952(b)(1)). The commenter believes that all large mass items, such as engines and cowlings, in the vicinity of the firewall would have to be restrained to prevent impact-induced firewall ruptures (i.e., preserve postimpact sealing ability). The commenter further believes that, based on other common design requirements such as fuel line penetrations of firewalls, the proposed amendment is impractical. Another commenter concurs with the proposed firewall survivable impact sealing retention requirement, but is concerned that a direct application of the proposed &sect;&sect;27.952(b)(1) and 29.952(b)(1) load factors would produce a stiff, heavy firewall that, while able to retain sealing capability, would be heavy, uneconomical, and not have the intended crash-resistant design features. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenters misinterpreted the intent of proposed &sect;&sect;27.952(e)(6) and 29.952(e)(6). These proposals are based on similar MIL&hyph;STD&hyph;1290 requirements that have been used in design for many years. The FAA does not intend that a firewall designed to the load factors of &sect;&sect;27.952(b)(1) and 29.952(b)(1) would retain its complete sealing ability under all post-crash threats. Thus, some leakage around typical vent and line penetrations and other small post-crash penetrations of the firewall in a survivable impact are acceptable. Unless an obvious, catastrophic hazard would be created in a survivable impact by atypical design features, restraint of the engines and cowling to prevent impact-induced firewall rupture was not intended. The FAA intends that the firewall retain its sealing ability in a survivable impact. The most significant problem addressed during the firewall design is deformation of the firewall induced by fuselage deformations under crash conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Professor Kazimieras Antanavicius, member of </F> the Seimas Economics Committee, by VALSTIECIU LAIKRASTIS  correspondent Juozas Kulakauskas; place and date not given:  "What Does the 1994 Budget Hold in Store?"]    [Text] With a majority voting in favor, the Seimas approved  the 1994 state budget on New Year's Eve. Opposition  representatives gave a negative evaluation of the new budget,  saying that it is socially unfair and a sham. We talked about  the new budget with Seimas Economics Committee member Professor  Kazimieras Antanavicius.    [Kulakauskas] Perhaps you would compare for us this year's  budget to last year's with respect to our economic development.  Are there signs in the budget that our country's economy has  stabilized or moved forward by at least a little bit?    [Antanavicius] It is possible to compare the situation in  this regard, and it should be done. And a reply to your question  can be given after analyzing sources of revenue and changes in  production. Data from the economics and finance ministries  indicate that the gross domestic product for production,  especially in agriculture, will be the same in 1994 as it was in  1993. But in real prices, the gross domestic product for 1992  amounted to only 47.5 percent of the 1989 level, and for 1993,  only 35.4 percent. Therefore, compared to the previous year,  production in 1993 dropped by 12 percent and will comprise only  a third of the 1989 production level this year. So one cannot  speak of any kind of improvement in the economy.    Despite the fact that there is no economic upswing, revenues  and outlays are being increased and will approximately double in  1994. Since there is a drop in production and stagnation, this  means that revenues can only be increased when taxes are  continually increased for the inhabitants. And the leadership,  unfortunately, is going down this road. Although a majority of  inhabitants already finds itself below the poverty level, the  leadership keeps coming up with new taxes: for income, for  resurveying land, for documents specifying the organization of  land exploitation (land cadastres), various certificates,  excises, etc. And all this is being done at a time when state  enterprises are not settling accounts in time with rural  inhabitants for agricultural production that has been delivered,  and when limits are being set on the purchase of this  production. This is simple robbery, and the reason it is  becoming impossible to live in Lithuania.    There can be two kinds of robbers in the country: those  outside the scope of the law and those government officials who  cloak themselves in the law. Even if the people can avoid the  former by fleeing or by defending themselves, they are powerless  against the latter. Groundless taxes smother the desire of the  people to work better, ruin production and the entire economy,  increase people's dissatisfaction and the social tension in the  country.    [Kulakauskas] How do you assess the proportions foreseen in  the budget for financing the fields of economics and social  matters? Is it right, for example, that the amount of funding  being earmarked for maintaining the country's government  apparatus is greater than that earmarked for culture and  education, and almost as much as is being set aside for  agriculture, health care, and social concerns?    [Antanavicius] Unfortunately, we still have a very long way  to go until we arrive at intelligent proportions. U.S. President  B. Clinton--who was elected a year ago--and his administration  started their work by looking for ways to decrease the funds  used for governing the country. French president F. Mitterrand  is undertaking to do the same thing towards the end of his term  of office. But I--having already spent several years in the  highest institution of our government--have never heard the verb  "to save".    This year, expenditures for governing the country are being  increased approximately twice as much as those for other areas.  This means that official plans call for appropriating 9 percent  of budget funds in 1994--and in fact this is about 12  percent--to expand and maintain the government apparatus. In  Latvia, meanwhile, 6 percent is being earmarked for this  purpose, and in Estonia, Sweden, Norway, and Austria, the total  is about 5 percent. And the latter three countries are markedly  richer than Lithuania. It is incomprehensible how the government  cannot see the poverty of thousands of its country's people and  how it can completely uselessly give away to officials the money  collected from the inhabitants who have earned it with their  blood and sweat. In this situation, the justified question  arises: whom does such a government represent--society, or only  itself?    [Kulakauskas] How do you assess the agricultural policy that  the LDDP is implementing now? Is sufficient attention paid in  the budget to agricultural financing?    [Antanavicius] So far there is no normal agricultural policy  at all. Lithuania is not going to be able to establish a market  agricultural economy without government subsidies, because  farmers will not have the funds for farm machinery, fertilizers,  or the construction of farm buildings. Unless it has government  support, the Lithuanian farm will remain a source of sustenance  only for the elderly people living there, because the production  of agricultural products will continue to fall.    There was talk in the LDDP's election program about state  support for agriculture, but that has now been forgotten. In the  spring of last year, for example, funds earmarked for farm  subsidies were transformed into credits, without giving thought  to how the farmers would be able to repay those credits if the  state itself does not pay them on time for the products they  have produced and delivered and if the state cannot force state  enterprises to settle accounts on time with the people. What  kind of government is this?    On the other hand, the state is obliged to foresee in the  budget not only funds to support agriculture, but also to  provide sufficient notice as to what kind of agricultural  production it intends to buy up, and in what quantities, so that  the people would know that their labor will not be for naught.  The state should help the farmers venture into foreign markets.  Unfortunately, no one is worrying about this and the farmers,  especially those who have recently begun to farm on their own  land, are left to the whims of fate.    Also, there is one clause in the budget which states that  subsidies, i.e. support, will be provided to the farm by  decreasing agricultural taxes. In other words, the people will  be "supported" by the money in their own pockets. This is real  derision. Given this kind of government policy, one just wants  to shout out to the farmers: "Work only as much as is necessary  to satisfy your own needs and those of your relatives, because  if you produce any more production, you will only have more  worries, and possibly losses as well!"    [Kulakauskas] How do you evaluate the ongoing argument  between the government and the opposition on the indexing of  people's deposits?    [Antanavicius] Deposits have to be indexed. This should have  been done quite a bit earlier, when the litas was introduced. I  had prepared a draft of a law dealing with this and proposed it  to the Seimas, but the majority in Seimas did not take it into  consideration, as they also did not take into consideration many  intelligent suggestions for better preparing the 1994 budget.    [Kulakauskas] Do you have any regrets about withdrawing from  the post of chairman of the Seimas Economics Committee?    [Antanavicius] I don't, because to remain in this position  would mean being responsible for the entirety of economic  policy, and it is morally unjustifiable and inexpedient to be  responsible for a policy with which one does not agree and which  one has no possiblities to change.</p>

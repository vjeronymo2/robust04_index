			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on "first ever" interview given to Israeli media </F> with Foreign Minister al-Thani by unidentified correspondents in  Doha on 3 May]    [Text] The Qatari foreign minister said today that he sees  no problem with Qatar establishing diplomatic relations with  Israel, but this must come after peace is established throughout  the Middle East. He made the remark a few minutes ago in a  conversation with Israeli reporters in Doha, upon the opening of  the multinational talks on arms control. Our correspondent in  Qatar Netan'el Semrik is on the telephone line from Qatar with  the gist of the first-ever interview a Qatari foreign minister  gave the Israeli media:    [Semrik] Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabbur al-Thani, the  Foreign Affairs Minister of the Qatari Emirate, smiled at the  Israeli cameras and told the Israeli microphones that in  principle he does not oppose visiting Israel. Everything  depends on the pace of the progress of the talks on all the  other tracks, he said.    [Begin recording] [Al-Thani, in English] Well, I cannot  answer this question but if everything goes well in all the  peace process on the Syrian and the Lebanese tracks, then I do  not see there is any problem.    [Unidentified correspondent, in English] Would you like to  invite the Israeli prime minister here to Qatar?    [Al-Thani, laughing, in English] Thank you very much. [end  recording]    [Semrik] The minister said he cannot answer the question on  whether he would like to visit Israel, but he has no problem in  doing so, provided the talks on the Israeli-Syrian-Lebanese  tracks make proper progress.</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Volvo starts shedding non-core activities Volvo yesterday underlined its new commitment to core vehicle activities when it announced the sale of its entire stake in Custos, an investment group, for SKr1.74bn (Dollars 218m). It is the first big disposal since the group's plans to merge with French carmaker Renault collapsed in December. It will produce a capital gain of SKr916m. The sale to Swedish and foreign institutions comprises 10.5m A shares and 1.5m B shares, equal to 25.4 per cent of Custos's capital and 29.1 per cent of its votes. Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo chief executive, said: 'The transaction is part of Volvo's concentration on its core operations and a way of reducing our debt. We believe that broader distribution of Custos's shares will benefit Custos.' Volvo's net debt stood at SKr14.3bn at the end of the first nine months of 1993. Volvo bought its Custos shares between 1985 and 1990 as part of an elaborate cross-ownership structure to thwart a hostile takeover, particularly from arch-rivals in the Wallenberg sphere. Its allies in the network were Skanska, Scandinavia's biggest construction group, and two other investment companies, Cardo and Protorp. The alliance started to dissolve after Custos sold its 9 per cent holding in Volvo last year, and it is likely it will disintegrate further. Analysts expect Volvo to sell its 47 per cent holding in Cardo and 43 per cent stake in Protorp in due course. Volvo, which is also steadily dismantling many of its links with Renault, sold its Custos stake for SKr145 per share, against a bourse price of SKr149. Skanska remains Custos's biggest shareholder. Custos has significant stakes in a clutch of leading Swedish blue chips, including Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the leading commercial bank, SCA, the forestry company, and Skanska.</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / UK Company News: P&amp;O plans flotation PENINSULAR and Oriental Steam Navigation yesterday announced that it was preparing a US flotation of some 6,677 US apartments owned by Laing Properties, a 50:50 joint venture between it and Chelsfield. P&amp;O said it would next week file a notice with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for the flotation of the portfolio as a real estate investment trust. Analysts estimate the REIT could be worth some Dollars 500m (Pounds 331m). If Laing retained a 25 per stake as planned, P&amp;O would raise about Pounds 125m to help reduce its net debt. It stood at Pounds 1.9bn for gearing of 84 per cent at last December but it had been cut to around 70 per cent in September. The sale would raise funds at a time when cash generation by its other operations was being hampered by recession. P&amp;O said Laing Properties Inc would continue to own some 2.7m sq ft of commercial property, which was part of the dealing portfolio.</p>

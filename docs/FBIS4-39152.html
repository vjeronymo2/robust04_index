			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondent Lev Ryabchikov for TASS] </F>   [Text] Simferopol 3 June TASS -- The Crimean parliament has  debated the republican government structure all day long today.    Parliament commissions and factions have discussed the  structure for a long time, and elaborated three drafts of the  corresponding law. The draft of the standing commission for  state building, legislation, lawfulness and legal order  coordinated with the government has been basically approved.    The draft includes a number of changes and amendments to the  current law on the system of central bodies of the Crimean state  executive power. Under the document all ministries and state  committees of the republic shall be formed and liquidated by the  parliament on proposal of the president. The minister shall be  a government member, appointed and removed from his post by the  president on coordination with the parliament. The government  can also include heads of other central bodies.    The suggested number of ministries and state committees  provoked parliament debates. It was finally decided to form key  ministries in order to enable government work. Proposals on  other ministries and committees will be submitted by the  government to the parliament within two weeks.    Asked about the discussions, Vice-Premier Yevgeniy Saburov  told UKRINFORM "it is a normal procedure. At the same time, the  situation is rather tense and we cannot afford even a week. We  should do it more quickly. But we have opponents in the  parliament, and they are using all methods to protract the  process. I am not sure everything will end today".    Despite this forecast, the parliament quickly agreed to  confirm the appointment of Anatoliy Franchuk minister for  control over state enterprises, Sergey Nikolskiy minister for  agriculture and foodstuffs, Andrey Chernyavskiy minister of  economy and Lyudmila Zaitseva minister of finance. The last  three have moved to the Crimea from Moscow.    Working groups of deputies from the Ukrainian and Crimean  parliaments continued working simultaneously with the debates to  elaborate proposals on settlement of the Crimean problem.</p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> JODOROWSKY SERVES UP MORE OF THE SAME IN 'SANTA SANGRE'  </P> <P> Alejandro Jodorowsky, the Chilean-born maestro of wretched excess, is back at  it after a 10-year absence. "Santa Sangre" (at the Nuart) is a grisly,  grotesque cross between "Psycho" and the Tod Browning-Lon Chaney "The Unknown"  served up with the writer-director's usual mishmash of religious and Freudian  symbolism topped with Fellini flourishes.  </P> <P> That Jodorowsky displays absolutely no sense of humor -- and not an iota of  subtlety either -- makes this Mexican picture, which is being shown in a  stilted English-language version, seem as silly as it is morbid.  </P> <P> No wonder our hero Fenix (played by 8-year-old Adan Jodorowsky) suffers a  mental breakdown, for he has witnessed his mother Concha (Blanca Guerra) and  father El Gran Orgo (a portly Guy Stockwell), the gross, knife-throwing  proprietor of Circo Gringo, caught up in the most savage acts of jealous rage  and revenge. From the high wire, Concha spies her husband and the circus'  voluptuous tattooed woman (Thelma Tixou) in the heat of passion.  </P> <P> She throws a lethal dose of acid at his genitals; dying, he retaliates by  slicing off her arms. There's crude poetic justice at work here, for Concha has  been the high priestess at a Mexico City temple dedicated to the worship of a  young girl raped by two brothers, who then cut off her arms; in the Browning  film, Chaney plays a knife thrower who pretends to be armless, but then cuts  off his arms in a macabre and tragic expression of love.  </P> <P> Escaping from the asylum at age 20, Fenix (now played by Axel Jodorowsky)  becomes his mother's red-nailed "hands," both offstage and on, where she  pantomimes/recites the Fall in the Garden of Evil (inspired by "The Creation of  the World" by mime Marcel Marceau, with whom Alejandro Jodorowsky worked and  studied for six years). One of those crazed puritans who believe that all women  other than herself are whores, Concha wills her son to become a mass murderer.  </P> <P> Consumed with self-hatred, Fenix tries to concoct a potion that will render him  invisible in emulation of Claude Rains in "The Invisible Man." However, his  name isn't Fenix -- that's Spanish for phoenix -- for nothing.  </P> <P> There's no denying Jodorowsky's visual flair in this film (rated a lenient R,  considering the bloodshed), as in its all-too-similar predecessors, "El Topo"  and "The Holy Mountain," but once again he exercises no restraint whatsoever  upon his feverish imagination, which results repeatedly in the most obvious,  overstated symbolism. Those weirdly compelling moments when Fenix becomes his  mother's graceful, expressive hands and arms are lost amid gallons of spilled  blood and garish, overwrought tableaux.  </P> <P> 'SANTA SANGRE' ('HOLY BLOOD')  </P> <P> An Expanded Entertainment release of an Intersound production.

According to the RAC's experts, called by 99,298 people who lost their car keys last year, the S Class Mercedes and Toyota Lexus were the most difficult to break into. Slightly exasperated proof of this fact is Alan Marsh, Inchcape director and chairman of Lexus UK to boot. Although the Japanese manufacturer had thoughtfully provided him with three sets of keys, Marsh managed to lock himself out of his car at Birmingham Airport. He called the RAC, which in turn called out a local specialist locksmith. Despite having watched a confidential training video on how to enter the Lexus, he gave up after three hours of fruitless struggle leaving Marsh with the onerous task of convincing the local Lexus agent that he was indeed the rightful owner.</p>

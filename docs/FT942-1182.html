			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Man in the News: New battleplan for Waterloo - Conrad Black This has been an incredible week for Ms Barbara Amiel, the right-wing Sunday Times columnist. Her views, usually described as trenchant, have recently encompassed the need for a firm stand against both North Korea and beggars. On Tuesday she held what has been described as the 'high society party of the summer' at the Ritz hotel in London, bringing together 150 people, including Princess Diana, to celebrate businessman Sir James Goldsmith's election as a Euro MP and his wife's 60th birthday. Ms Amiel's husband, Conrad Black, chairman of the Telegraph group, had quite a week, too. Before heading for the Ritz, Black had been putting the finishing touches to the decision to cut the price of the Daily Telegraph from 48p to 30p. The decision led to a sharp fall in the Telegraph share price, which exposed Black to something approaching hatred in the City of London because he sold Pounds 73m-worth of Telegraph shares last month at what now looks like a fancy price. It also provoked a counter-attack from Rupert Murdoch, who cut the price of The Times to 20p. But Black is a tough general. 'This is not a problem, I have been in tighter corners than this,' he said on Thursday night, after hearing of the latest Murdoch manoeuvre and before going off to dinner with Barbara, his second wife who, he says, has made him happier than he has ever been. By any standards, however, he is fighting a tight corner. And Black acknowledges that Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, which owns five national newspapers including the cut-price Sun and the cut-price Times - both selling at 20p - is 'playing hardball'. The owner of the Telegraph group said he believed that 'he (Mr Murdoch) wants to put the weaker companies to the wall. I am a capitalist and a Darwinian and I don't raise moral objection to that, although we're a live-and-let-live company'. The Canadian newspaper proprietor, with more than a passing interest in military history and the achievements of Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, laces his conversation with talk of war in the wake of Murdoch's fierce retaliation. 'You can't make war and peace at the same time, you can't suck and blow at the same time. If you're going to regret an escalation of hostilities by an adversary who has already declared war on you, you might as well have flown up the white flag in the first place.' He is similarly defiant about City innuendo that, when his main company, Hollinger, sold 12.5m Telegraph shares on May 19 at 587p, he had thoughts of cutting the price of the paper. Black said he returned from New York last week to find a recommendation 'from all my management' that the paper should cut its cover price. May's circulation figures, out earlier this month, showed The Times had increased its sales by 35,000 compared with April, to a new record of 515,000. The choice, as they saw it, was between acting now and watching their circulation drift slowly down. 'Was I seriously supposed to say: 'Sorry, fellows, we can't do it because it will give me a public relations problem.' That is no way to run a company. You do what you have to do when you have to do it,' said Black. He added that he had recently discovered a new profit centre - suing people for defamation - and promised to sue anyone who cast direct aspersions on the share sale. The hard attitude financial community have taken towards Black and the Telegraph, however unjustified, may make it difficult for the organisation to raise money in the City of London for some time. But was the Telegraph price cut, which will cost Pounds 40m gross in a full year, wise? Has not Black merely caused pandemonium in the newspaper market, damaged the profitability of his paper and devalued the 77m Telegraph shares Hollinger continues to own - and possibly undermined the future of The Independent - all for a toe-to-toe slugging match with Mr Murdoch? 'I am not one of those who desires to see a smaller number of newspapers published. We are not trying to run anyone out of business. We are just not interested in being bowled out by Murdoch,' said Black, who believes the effect of the price cut on the Telegraph's profits will be relatively marginal. 'If it shakes out the way we think, I think we will have the pleasure of having stopped the inexorable rise of The Times, shored up our own position and taken only a marginal hit to profit,' he said. Nevertheless, the price war could turn out to be the newspaper equivalent of a winter campaign in Russia for Black, who bought effective control of the Daily Telegraph at a cost of about Pounds 20m in 1986. Price cuts are not the only topic exercising his staff this week. Max Hastings, Telegraph editor-in-chief, appointed Simon Heffer, a journalist known for right-wing views, as deputy editor, amid reports that Hastings was a candidate for being 'kicked upstairs'. Black conceded: 'I became impatient not with the ideological tenor of the paper but with the lack of sharpness. It just wasn't robust and vigorous enough and needed to be a little bit more of a thunderer (the old nickname for The Times).' On top of this week's turmoil, the Telegraph, a quintessentially Conservative newspaper (though it does criticise individual Conservative governments), could be heading for a period of opposition. If Labour wins the next election, then Black and Ms Amiel will be invited to few powerful political parties, even though Black regards Tony Blair, the favourite for the Labour leadership as 'a perfectly nice man'. As usual, Black takes the historic view. The Daily Telegraph, he explained, had been founded in 1855 essentially to oppose the then prime minister Lord Aberdeen, and the Duke of Cambridge as commander of the British army. 'You can't always have your own people in power. If we found ourself as a highly oppositionalist paper, that is frequently a very enjoyable position for a newspaper to be in,' said the man who is today many millions of pounds poorer than he was at the Ritz on Tuesday evening.</p>

Acosta is wanted in  connection with the murder of Martin Arguello Trujillo in Los Angeles on Jan.  2.  </P> <P> The television show dramatized the story of Acosta, known to fight fans as "El  Gato," who was a light-middleweight contender in the early 1980s before he  began using drugs and losing fights. Acosta and Trujillo had argued the night  Trujillo was killed with three shots from a .38-caliber revolver.  </P> <P> Thomas Hughes, special agent in charge of the San Diego FBI office, said a  number of viewers called the FBI and San Diego Police Department with  information about Acosta's whereabouts after the show.  </P> <P> Mexican state judicial police arrested Acosta about 11 p.m. Thursday at an  apartment in Tijuana. He will be held for trial in Mexico because he is a  Mexican citizen.  </P></p>

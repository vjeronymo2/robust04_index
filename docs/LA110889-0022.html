			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Two Steps Back: How are women portrayed in the 26 new television shows that  bowed this fall? "From mediocre to awful" is the verdict in a report scheduled  to be released today at the 11th annual Women at Work Broadcast Awards luncheon  in Washington. The report, titled "Two Steps Back," was issued by the National  Commission on Working Women of Wider Opportunities for Women. Actress Linda  Lavin, a NCWW commissioner who will host the luncheon, says, "At best, the new  season has given us the status quo. At worse, television has taken a step  backward from the progress it made last year." Only two shows received good  marks -- "Life Goes On" (ABC) and "Alien Nation" (Fox). "Major Dad" (CBS), and  the already canceled "Chicken Soup" (ABC) and "The People Next Door" were  criticized for "straining viewer credibility." The report said "Doogie Howser"  (ABC), "Baywatch" (NBC) and "Living Dolls" (ABC) indicate that "double  entendres and smarmy sex" are still part of the TV picture. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

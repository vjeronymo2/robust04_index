			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: AFTER 50 YEARS, PRIEST TAKES A BREAK  </P> <P> While preparing for priesthood, Msgr. Francis Roughan told himself: "Roughan,  you are a generous character to give up marriage and family life to get to  heaven."  </P> <P> He came from a loving family with four brothers, all of them born at home.  </P> <P> After becoming a priest and learning more about what he calls the heroics and  challenges of married life, he had another chat with himself.  </P> <P> "Roughan, you were just a coward. It would have taken more courage to be a real  fine spouse and parent then to be a priest," he told himself.  </P> <P> Now, 50 years later, the recently retired pastor of Our Lady of Guadalupe  Catholic Church in La Habra is even more awed by the rigors of marriage and  parenthood.  </P> <P> But he prepared himself well to help the estimated 1,000 couples he has married  and counseled.  </P> <P> In the 1960s, Roughan became chairman of a church-sponsored marriage  preparation course "and that was the time we were really getting into  engagement encounters," he said.  </P> <P> He was often asked how a priest can be knowledgeable about marriage and its  strains.  </P> <P> "I tell them the story about another priest who would tell his people that he  never laid an egg, but he was a better judge of an omelet than any chicken," he  said.  </P> <P> He explains that priests are able to get close to people from infancy through  adulthood, and one of the reasons is that priests don't have marriages or  families of their own.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles-born priest said everyone knows they have an equal claim on  him.  </P> <P> "Belonging to no one means you belong to everyone," said Roughan, 74, who was  recently honored by upward of 550 parishioners, friends and 65 priests at a  "Golden Jubilee of Priestly Ordination" celebration of his retirement.  </P> <P> He was defined by a fellow priest as "a prince of a gentleman."  </P> <P> Roughan avoids the use of the word retirement since he daily continues to  celebrate Mass and visit hospitals and convalescent homes.  </P> <P> "Retirement indicates inactivity," said the Los Angeles Loyola High School  graduate, and although admitting he has slowed a bit, "I'm not inactive. I'm  carrying out most of my duties.  </P> <P> "It doesn't mean any changes except someone else becomes the pastor," he  explained.  </P> <P> The one-time Los Angeles College Seminary student is also forthright about his  feelings about what he calls "outlawing" the name of God in schools and other  places.  </P> <P> "When something is outlawed it makes it sound like it is condemned," he said.  "It's a tragedy that legislative bodies have gone to that extent to not mention  the word of God. They are committing moral suicide."  </P> <P> Roughan, who once cured a stuttering problem with singing lessons, believes the  ruling has even more far-reaching effects.  </P> <P> He claims that when young people grow up lacking a sense of reverence for God,  "they are not apt to have much consideration in pleasing a fellow creature.  They become self-centered."  </P> <P> And while Roughan has spent most of his life counseling others, he has helped  himself with a fine golf game.  </P> <P> Roughan, whose parents were born in Ireland but met in Hollywood, once broke  par at the Hacienda Golf Club in La Habra.  </P> <P> He claimed it was the luck of the Irish . It happened on St. Patrick's Day in  1959.  </P> <P> Finally, after delivering an estimated 4,000 babies, Dr. Dave David, 39, got  one of his own.  </P> <P> "Each baby I've had the privilege of delivering has been perfect," he said.  "But somehow this one is even more perfect."  </P> <P> The Newport Beach physician and his wife Jeri named their 6-pound, 11-ounce son  Harrison.  </P> <P> For the first time, David will be able to bring his own family to the annual  picnic he hosts for the families of babies he has delivered.  </P> <P> David, a Laguna Beach resident, is also the star of "Making Womb for Baby!," a  comprehensive video on pregnancy and childbirth.  </P></p>

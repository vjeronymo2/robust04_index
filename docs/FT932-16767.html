			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Three cheers for the end of Taurus - Diary of a Private Investor / But will its successor be worse? Taurus is dead] Ya, boo, I told you so. That was my first reaction on hearing the stock exchange had abandoned its computerised settlement system, partly because it still does not work. I have been questioning the nature of Taurus since 1988, pointing out its inadequacies and wondering if it could ever be made to function efficiently and cheaply. My concerns were heightened when, some years ago, I was elected chairman of the Stock Exchange Investors' Club and met some of the Taurus 'experts' and exchange officials. I remember one such meeting in 1990 when even a few simple questions stumped one of the experts. For example, how would Taurus cope with a husband transferring shares to his wife, or deal with institutions engaging in similar 'off-market' deals? How would it cope with people buying shares in a company if those purchases were not matched immediately by sales? Under the existing arrangements, a market-maker might agree to sell shares to an investor, even if it did not have those shares on its books, because it would hope to have acquired them by settlement day. But could Taurus cope with 'negative stock' - or would everything have to be done on a matched bargain basis? I felt that this sort of questioning was unusual, as many stock exchange officials appeared to believe the experts were experts and let them get on with it. It did not help that, as Taurus 'progressed,' the operating manuals grew ever more complex and unreadable. I can imagine exchange officials picking up these weighty tomes, looking at such gibberish and then nodding wisely, unwilling to admit they did not understand it but hoping the experts did. Were the experts themselves briefed properly, though? Several times, I noticed some of them wearing a 'nobody ever told me it was supposed to be able to do that' expression, followed by a resigned 'back to the drawing board' look. Over the years, in a number of FT articles, I have pointed out that Taurus supposedly was being introduced to reduce costs and 'get the paper out of the system.' Yet, it appeared to me likely that costs would increase and there would be even more paperwork. One piece of paper (the share certificate) sent via a broker would, under Taurus, be replaced by perhaps four or more pieces of paper sent every year to an investor detailing the shares held on his behalf by a nominee. There would be still be contract notes for each transaction. I also questioned the safety of the system against fraudulent abuse - or even the potential risk of a broker's employee inputting wrong information. In a letter of March 16 1989, circulated to a number of stock exchange officials I questioned the whole basis on which Taurus had been established. The system was supposed to be a 'necessary tool' to speed up share transactions and cut costs. I pointed out that many of the delays and costs incurred under the existing system seemed to be caused by a few slow company registrars, and by market makers selling shares they could not get, rather than by non-market making brokers. As an example, I gave my purchase of 1,250 shares in a small quoted company, G&amp; G. Kynock, in January 1988 which had resulted in two certificates (one for 665 shares and the other for 585) being sent to me separately more than one year afterwards. There were quicker, cheaper and safer ways to remove such delays from the system than by using Taurus, I argued. I suggested that the existing share settlement system used in the US could be adapated for Britain. A depository company - vetted and monitored by the Bank of England - could be established to hold share and bond certificates on behalf of the beneficial holders - a difference being that, unlike the US system, the shares would not be registered in a marking name but in the actual names of the investors concerned. Because the depository company would 'hold' share certificates for millions of investors, it would be likely that many purchases and sales could be matched within the company without the need for investors to handle share certificates - although those who did want one could have it at no extra charge. I suggested that each investor might be allocated a code number (or even a bar code) which could be attached electronically to each of his shareholdings. There would only be one code per person, so making it much easier to get printouts of his investments. I also made other, more detailed, proposals. I was concerned to ensure that the private investor was treated no less favourably than an institutional one. Perhaps my suggestions might have had more impact had I called my system Scorpio (Share Clearance Organisation for Private Investors and Others) - the 'others' being the institutions - and charged Pounds 10m in consultancy fees rather than providing free ideas. I am now very concerned that the stock exchange could repeat the mistakes of the past, this time aided and abetted by the Bank of England. The government says it is a firm believer in 'wider share ownership.' It needs to be if it wants to raise much-needed funds from private investors for privatisation issues. Yet, so far as I am aware, the Bank's task force, established to find a Taurus replacement, does not include ordinary private investors. I am sure that a number of these could provide many useable suggestions at much less cost than some experts. There is also talk of a 'two-tier' settlement system, which could well have a detrimental effect on the share prices offered to the private investor. Also, if one system can produce the mess of Taurus, think what two could do . . .</p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Drink: A French defence against the world - The low-cost country wines of France THE MOST imaginative innovation of the French wine authorities in the past 20 years was the initiation in 1973 of the category of Vin de Pays  - French country wines. After the reform of superior vineyard areas started in 1935, with the Appellation d'Origine Controlee system (AOC), backed by the moderately successful Vin Delimite de Qualite Superieure (VDQS) classification in 1951, the industry was left with an enormous wine lake. It exceeded half the country's annual production and used to be called Vin de Consommation Courante, but now bears the EC title Vin de Table. This was subject to almost no control beyond a minimum alcoholic strength of 8`. The majority of Vin de Table came from the Midi, presenting a problem as much social and political as vinous. To interpose a further control system that did not insist on specific grapes local to a particular district, and over-restrictive maximum yields on wines bound to sell at low prices presented some difficulty. But, after an enabling decree in 1968, production started in 1973 under specified rules, followed in 1979 with detailed production practices and minimum analysis standards. A Vin de Pays is a table wine with a geographical origin. The grapes for each must come from a recommended list in its department, the yields must not exceed 90 hl per ha, and 80 for a few zonal or regional ones. The minimum strength is 9` but 10` in the Mediterranean regions. Yields must be declared and the relevant denomination - as there is often a choice between zonal, departmental and local. Chemical analysis must accompany the request for registration, including such items as alcoholic strength, total acidity and sulphur dioxide content. This is followed by a tasting by a panel including growers, merchants, and oenologists. There are four regional denominations, 39 departmental and 98 local ones. The names on the labels have been chosen with promotional care. Who could resist Vin de Pays du Jardin de France (Loire) or Vallee du Paradis (Aude)? And those who remember Alfonse Daudet's parish priest of Cucignan may well be encouraged to sample its Vins de Pay, its 7,000 cases of almost entirely red wine are largely made by the local co-op. The greatest improvement in French wines today is taking place in the Midi, and 85 per cent of the Vins de Pays are produced in Languedoc, Roussillon and Provence. This has given the peasant growers something to aim for and better, though still low, prices. The figure are impressive. In the first authorised year of 1974, production amounted to 6.2m hl, but was over 11m last year - half the total French Vin de Table and more than 25 per cent of 1991's heavily reduced wine production. In the UK the Vins de Pays were launched in 1979, with the equivalent of 78,000 cases sold that year. Last year, the total was 427,000 cases. Now they are to be found in every supermarket and on every wine merchant's list, many of which include special selections for them (although these often confusingly contain wines such as Bergerac or Cahors, which are Appellation controlee and not Vins de Pays). Vins de Pays generally cost between Pounds 3.50 and just under Pounds 6 a bottle and provide almost embarrassingly wide choice. The most popular here is white Cotes de Gascogne, produced mainly from the Ugni Blanc and Colombard grapes grown for armagnac. Some 20 years ago, this was a very depressed area making otherwise very ordinary Vin Ordinaire. Now it produces about 1.9m cases, with Germany and the UK the biggest importers. The Vins de Pays are France's low-price-wine defence against the New World. The Italians are preparing to launch a category lower than DOC - IGT (Indicazioni Geografiche Tipiche), which very much resembles the Vins de Pays system. While French wine exports have been generally falling, those of the Vins de Pays are at least stable and may be still increasing.</p>

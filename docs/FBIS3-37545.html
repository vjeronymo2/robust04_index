LDP leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and two members of the  party's State Duma group, Viktor Kobelev and Aleksandr  Vengerovskiy, told reporters on Thursday that Wednesday's stated  resignation of Kobelev from the LDP group in the lower house had  been a stratagem to reveal "dissenters" within the party and  security services' machinations.    "We have never made it a secret that intelligence services,  including the Russian ones, are taking systematic steps against  the LDP and other patriotic parties," said Vengerovskiy, deputy  speaker of the State Duma.    He said that, aware of intelligence services' plans to  "split" the LDP at its next congress, scheduled for April 2,  1994, the party leadership had resorted to a ploy "to reveal the  possible sources of a split, all the people [that might cause  it] and their contacts."    Zhirinovsky said that now "everything was OK." in the party  and its parliamentary group, while "some of the intelligence  services will receive no bonus payments for February."    Kobelev said he had "minor ideological disagreements" with  Zhirinovskiy, taking a "milder position" than the party leader.  As "the number-two person in the party," he would be meeting  Zhirinovskiy more often now, he said.    Zhirinovskiy said the maneuver had made it possible to  expose  "secret agents" in the central bodies of the party, and in its  regional organizations in Krasnoyarsk territory, St. Petersburg  and Vologda. As a result, some of the party's senior officers  in the LDP, whose total membership he puts at 120,000-150,000,  were fired, he said.    He said that, following the party's victory at the  parliamentary election, which came as a surprise to the whole  world, "the intelligence services of all countries are concerned  about the activities of the party" and demand information about  it.</p>

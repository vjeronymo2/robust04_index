			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Inflating the Nest"] </F>   [Text] The PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] is  gaining Barelli, Albano, and Aureliano but losing its original  identity. The search for a slate on which to be a candidate in  the October elections is transforming the parties into electoral  Frankensteins.    When it was founded, back during the days of the Constituent  Assembly in 1988, the PSDB immediately acquired a symbol and a  nickname. Its symbol is the toucan, and its nickname was the  "Sorbonne Party," a reference to its necktie-sporting leaders  with their doctorates. So far the party has remained faithful to  its mascot, but not to its nickname. Over the last few days, the  party has picked up members as disparate as an economist with  ties to unions, a business leader, and a rancher. In other  words, it has attracted a sympathizer of the PT [Workers Party],  a former member of Collor's PRN [National Reconstruction Party],  and a former bionic governor from Arena [National Renewal  Alliance]. To put things even more clearly, the party has been  joined by Minister of Labor Walter Barelli; Albano Franco,  president of the National Confederation of Industry (CNI); and  former Minas Gerais Governor Aureliano Chaves. What do the three  of them have in common? Until a few days ago, they had nothing.  Now they have the party.    The "Frankensteinization" of Brazilian parties had a  deadline. According to the election timetable approved by  Congress, politicians wanting to be candidates in the elections  of 3 October had to join a party by Sunday the 9th. Just before  that date arrived, the parties received an avalanche of new  members who, on the pretext of offering electoral benefits,  ended up further eroding the distinctiveness of the various  parties. Besides the PSDB, the phenomenon also had a strong  effect on at least two other parties: the PP [Progressive Party]  and the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party]. But it was in the PSDB  that the repercussions were greatest.    The toucan symbolizing the PSDB is now sporting a promising  forelock [a reference to President Franco]. It was with the  support of President Itamar Franco and his team that the PSDB  gained Barelli and Albano Franco. The party also took in  Minister of Justice Mauricio Correa, who had been without a  party since his break with Leonel Brizola and the PDT  [Democratic Labor Party]. The invasion by politicians with  different plumages has caused an uproar in the tucano nest. "The  only thing lacking is for General Figueiredo to join the PSDB,"  Deputy Edmundo Galdino (PSDB, Tocantins) raves.    The strongest objections have concerned Albano Franco. The  senator was invited to join three months ago by Minister  Fernando Henrique Cardoso and PSDB President Tasso Jereissati,  who is Albano's partner in a bid to win the contract for  cellular telephones in Ceara. The PSDB bloc in the Chamber of  Deputies, headed by Deputy Jose Serra, opened its beak at the  time and is still complaining. Reactions opposing Albano have  also come from Sao Paulo, where the PSDB is strongest. Senator  Mario Covas, the PSDB's candidate for governor of Sao Paulo, has  told friends that he would not like to see Albano on the party  slate.    But the most indignant reaction has come from Senator Jutahy  Magalhaes, Sr., who is threatening to change parties if Albano's  membership is not rejected. The problems between the two men  involve a murky family quarrel. As minister of social welfare,  Jutahy Magalhaes, Jr., did everything he could to get rid of the  Brazilian Welfare Legion (LBA) headed by Leonor Franco, Albano's  wife. Leonor not only managed to keep the LBA intact: she was  even appointed to be the new minister of social welfare.    Although controversial, Aureliano's decision to join has not  caused a commotion equal to the one created by the arrival of  Albano. "I have no aspirations to be a candidate," says the  former governor and former vice president. "I joined the PSDB  only in order to have a platform for the more consistent  exercise of citizenship," he philosophizes. With a new look and  a little mustache as well, Aureliano withdrew from politics  after bringing up the rear in the presidential election of 1989.  Despite his denials, he is behaving like someone who wants to  run for state governor, but along the way he is going to  encounter PSDB member and former Minister Paulino Cicero, who  also has his eye on the governorship of Minas Gerais.    While the addition of Albano and Aureliano to the party has  been viewed with distrust, the same cannot be said of Barelli's  decision to join. The minister has not only been well received:  he is already the subject of jokes. Barelli is being called the  PSDB's most likable economist, making him a counterpoint to  Deputy Jose Serra's difficult temperament.    The 1994 elections may also include the charms of the most  refined Rio de Janeiro elite. Socialite Regina Marcondes Ferraz  is the most illustrious acquisition by the PPR in Rio de  Janeiro. Now that she has joined the party at the request of  former Minister of Finance Francisco Dornelles, Regina will have  someone in the party with whom to discuss Chanel's latest  collection. The reason is that the PPR has also received  reinforcement in the form of the first lady of Alagoas, Denilma  Bulhoes, who is in the habit of wearing the most famous European  labels while campaigning in the environs of Maceio. Regina may  not have Denilma's political experience, but she does not  consider herself a novice. "During the 1989 presidential  campaign, I even held meetings in my home for Maluf," she says.  "Considering all the chaos in which the country finds itself, I  decided that it was time to participate more fully, so I joined  the PPR." Regina has not yet decided whether to be a candidate,  although her friend Dornelles is pressing her to do so.    Taken by a sudden interest in politics since he began  courting former Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello, humorist Chico  Anysio also beat the deadline for party affiliation by choosing  a party, although like Regina, he is not confirming his  candidacy. Chico chose the PP. One of those at his side will be  union leader Luiz Antonio de Medeiros, president of Union Power.  Medeiros first considered joining the PSDB, but he was  intimidated by the posturing of the party leaders in Sao Paulo  with all their plumage. Since the perch was so narrow, he chose  to land in the PP, which has "progressive" in its name and a  bunch of conservatives in its ranks. To give an example, he will  be in the company of Brasilia businessman Luiz Estevao, Fernando  Collor's inseparable friend--one of the latter's few inseparable  friends, let it be said. The PRN, which had more than 30  deputies at the start of the Collor administration, is now down  to seven musketeers.  <H5>  Three Party Models </H5>   PSDB: Known as the party of intellectuals, it now presents  an  eclectic profile: the standard PSDB member wears the hat of  Aureliano Chaves (formerly of the PFL [Liberal Front Party]),  has the face of Minister Barelli (formerly almost a member of  the PT) and the body of businessman and Senator Albano Franco  (formerly of the PRN), and wears the tennis shoes of Deputy  Maurilio Ferreira Lima (formerly of the PMDB [Brazilian  Democratic Movement Party]).    PPR: The party that has always had the face of Maluf is  acquiring new ingredients in addition to the unmistakable bald  head of Esperidiao Amin. The party is celebrating the solid  acquisition of First Lady Denilma Bulhoes. Socialite Regina  Marcondes Ferraz has also joined, although she denies wanting to  be a candidate.    PP: This is one of the newest and most heterogeneous  parties.  It has the distinctive hair of former Governor Alvaro Dias  (Parana), the huge mustache of Luiz Antonio de Medeiros, the  body of Professor Raimundo/Chico Anysio, and the legs of  Governor Joaquim Roriz (Federal District), who is having a rough  time on the CPI [congressional investigating committee].</p>

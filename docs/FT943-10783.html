			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Le glossary a useful exercise for Toubon Sir, Perhaps Mr Jacques Toubon could do something really useful now that France's Constitutional Council has stymied his bid for language protectionism ('Toubon vows to continue his war of words', August 1) . A glossary of so-called English/American words that have taken on a life of their own in Franglais would be handy, together with current pronunciation. Weekends and hamburgers are clearly no problem for native English speakers trying to do the right thing in French. But I need frequent updates these days on items such as le footing, le jogging, le forcing, les baskets, le sweat (pronounced sweet). As of today, they apparently translate as jogging, track-suit pants, putting on the pressure, trainers (sport shoes), sweat-shirt. Le feedback, please. Eva Kaluzynska, 119 Rue Philippe Baucq, 1040 Brussels, Belgium</p>

			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER TOWER  </P> <P> I don't know if Tower is qualified to be secretary of defense, and I certainly  can't tell based on innuendo reported in the media whether he has a drinking  problem, but I think his pledge to abstain from alcohol was poorly made (Part  I, 27). The question regarding Tower's drinking is, does he have a problem  serious enough to make him unfit for office? By now, the Senate should have  sufficient evidence to determine if he does.  </P> <P> We don't need the precedent of someone swearing to a code of moral behavior to  prove his suitability for public service. What we need is competence,  experience and integrity in our leaders, not a willingness to promise never to  drink, take drugs, smoke cigarettes or take the Lord's name in vain.  </P> <P> KEITH GAYHART  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

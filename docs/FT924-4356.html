			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Sanctions lay low Serbian economy SANCTIONS are sounding the death knell of the Serbian economy, ruined by more than a year of war and the collapse of trade with the former Yugoslav republics. Tighter sanctions, especially the oil embargo, are likely to bite with even greater severity following the United Nations Security Council vote on November 16 to tighten up on transshipments through Yugoslavia, now comprising Serbia and Montenegro. Mr Tomislav Popovic, a Belgrade economist, believes that within three months Serbia will have grave problems providing its people with energy and food. He expects that the gross social product (a measurement roughly 10 per cent less than western gross domestic product calculations) will fall to Dollars 1.7bn in the last quarter of this year, a drop of Dollars 5bn on the same period three years ago. Only a quarter of the 2.4m labour force is working and producing effectively, says Mr Popovic. Unable to keep industry going, state enterprises have sent about 800,000 workers on 'forced holidays'. Prices rose by 50 per cent in October, and industrial production fell about 25 per cent from the same period last year. The Yugoslav dinar, was devalued from 200 to the dollar to 750 last month. But on the flourishing black market, hard currency is being sold well above the new official rate. Says one western diplomat: 'For the time being it is a cash economy, but if inflation continues to rise, the dinar will not be worth using.' Given the near collapse of the banking system, 40 per cent of all transactions are in cash, compared with 5-8 per cent in an average western economy. Credit cards are no longer accepted. Diplomats say even the astronomical inflation rate no longer fully reflects the catastrophic economic situation. A price freeze covers 42 per cent of all goods. 'Further, the basket of goods has changed,' says a western diplomat. 'People don't buy meat, many have stopped buying clothes and they can't buy newspapers.' Two private banks, which have close ties to the government, are helping to keep the social peace by offering high interest rates on dinar deposits. The banks, Dafiment and Jugoskandic, offer rates of up to 95 per cent per month, nearly double the official inflation rate. Each night thousands of Belgrade inhabitants queue up to collect their interest, which enables many to make ends meet. The tightened trade embargo may hurt Dafiment and Jugoskandic which diplomats believe have made enormous profits from sanctions busting. In spite of the oil embargo, the bank owners have opened up private petrol stations, licensed by the Serbian authorities. Sanctions-busting has also encouraged a growing segment of society to turn to crime, and the black market offers a wide range of wares from petrol to Kalashnikov rifles. Thanks to sanctions violations about 5-10 per cent of the population are getting rich by current Yugoslav standards, says Mr Dobrijvoje Radovanovic, director of the Institute of Criminology. But Mr Popovic estimates that half Serbia's 9.8m inhabitants are below the poverty line, earning less than Dollars 370 a year. The huge influx of refugees from Bosnia and Croatia has also taxed an already overburdened system. As the situation deteriorates, the government has introduced further austerity measures, putting the economy on a virtual war footing.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Paul Jacob in Jakarta] </F>   [Text] Jakarta -- Singapore and Indonesia yesterday  announced wide-ranging proposals to help boost the level of  tourism in the two countries and strengthen the republic's  involvement in developing supporting infrastructure for the  sector here.    Communications and Environment Minister Mah Bow Tan said  after calling on President Suharto that cooperation could  involve joint identification of new tourist destinations, joint  promotion and marketing, and development of air services.    The proposals also include cooperation in upgrading of  airport facilities and the development of hotel and tourist  resorts in Indonesia.    Mr. Mah was speaking at the end of a two-day visit to  discuss  the tourism cooperation proposals first raised in February  during a visit by Foreign Affairs Minister S. Jayakumar.    His presence here as a personal envoy of Prime Minister Goh  Chok Tong was seen as underlining the importance which Singapore  attached to the ventures.    In Singapore, Mr. Goh said at a function in Bukit Panjang  that Mr. Mah was in Indonesia to present Singapore's proposals  for funnelling tourists from Singapore to Indonesia.    This would benefit both countries as they could be then be  marketed to tourists together, he said.    He said that it was the first time that he was sending a  personal envoy. Asked if more such envoys would be sent in  future, he replied: "I think it will depend on the purpose."    In a signal of the seriousness with which Indonesia was  treating the proposals, its senior economic ministers and State  Secretary Murdiono arrived at the president's office immediately  after Mr. Mah to meet Mr. Suharto and map out follow-up action.    Details of the proposals will be discussed further by  high-level ministerial teams on both sides -- Singapore headed  by Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Indonesia's by  coordinating minister for trade and industry, Hartarto.    The Singapore team will include Mr. Mah and Trade and  Industry Minister Yeo Cheow Tong, while Tourism, Post, and  Telecommunications Minister Joop Ave and Transportation Minister  Haryanto Dhanutirto round off the Indonesian side.    Mr. Ave told THE SUNDAY TIMES that a memorandum of  understanding to serve as an umbrella agreement for cooperation  would also be drawn up within the next two to three months.    Both he and Mr. Hartarto also said in separate comments that  Singapore's proposals on tourism cooperation were welcomed by  Mr. Suharto and had the full support of cabinet colleagues.    In his earlier remarks to the press, Mr. Mah said Singapore  believed that as close neighbours, there was "great scope for  both countries to cooperate in tourism development for mutual  benefit".    He noted that cooperation in the development and promotion  of  tourism was, in fact, already under way in the Riau islands,  principally Batam and Bintan.    "Good progress is being made there. We believe that we can  expand the scope of Indonesia-Singapore tourism cooperation to  the rest of Indonesia," he said.    "The aim is to get more visitors to Singapore to include  Indonesia in the package visits."    Singapore attracted more than six million tourists last year  of which 70 percent also visited other countries. Of that  percentage, 20 percent went to Indonesia. Mr Mah's hope, shared  by Mr. Ave, was to see an increase in the 20 percent figure.    Singapore also aimed to increase the number of tourists  visiting the republic so that tourist arrivals in both countries  would then also register increases, he said.    Both Mr. Hartarto and Mr. Ave said Indonesia aimed to see  aspects of the proposed cooperation get off the ground by  September this year and pledged to provide significant  opportunities for private sector involvement.    Mr. Ave said that Singapore was keen on infrastructure  development to support the tourism sector and said the areas  included link roads and airports as well as hotels and tourist  resorts in Indonesia. He said Mr. Suharto saw Singapore being  able to play a role "as a provider of financial resources or as  an investor in a variety of ways such as through joint ventures  and joint operations."    Both he and Mr. Hartarto also said in separate comments that  Singapore's proposals on tourism cooperation were welcomed by  Mr. Suharto and had the full support of cabinet colleagues.    Indonesia had singled out existing tourist destinations and  those with potential which could benefit from the co-operation.  These were in West Sumatra Province, Yogyakarta, and Solo in  Central Java, Lombok island off Bali, and Ujungpandang in South  Sulawesi Province.</p>

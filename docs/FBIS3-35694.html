Oleg Soskovets Has Boosted His Standing in Government"]    [Text] The spectacular increase in Oleg Soskovets' clout  in the structures of authority has been confirmed not only by  the fact that so far he has remained the only first deputy prime  minister of the reorganized government, but also by giving his  Commission for Day-to-Day Matters [CDM] unprecedented powers.  The statute on the commission, which was released yesterday for  official distribution, contains so extensive a list of powers  that it lends credibility to talk about an effectively  monopolistic center of economic power in the government in the  making.    Last summer, when the CDM was set up especially for Oleg  Soskovets, it was assumed that it would deal with matters of  more of less secondary importance, for which the Council of  Ministers Presidium would have no time. In the extreme case,  the commission was intended to be a filter of sorts to sift out  materials not properly prepared for government meetings. The  commission's 28 meetings since 15 June 1993, however, have  caused a qualitative change in the situation -- the CDM has  evolved from a marginal body into an "acting" Council of  Ministers Presidium. The government document released yesterday  only formalized de jure what had already been accomplished.  Now, Oleg Soskovets will directly control matters related to  changing fuel, electric power, and railway tariffs. Another  noteworthy provision gives the commission the right to consider  matters related to granting financial and credit resources to  industry. Thus Oleg Soskovets has continued the "expansion" of  CDM's powers that had started with the Economy Ministry's  handing the right to allocate export quotas over to it --  hitherto all credits had been allocated by a special government  body headed by the finance minister. The commission was just as  decisive in "crossing the path" of the federal administration  for enterprises' bankruptcies -- judging from the document, the  structure subordinate to the State Property Committee will keep  responsibility only for technical procedures, whereas the CDM  will determine their "ideology." It is plainly evident that  this allocation of powers suits Viktor Chernomyrdin, who has  entrusted his deputy with all economic matters (including  strategic ones) in order to gain greater freedom on the  political scene.   <H5>    The lineup of Commission for Day-to-Day Matters </H5>   Oleg Soskovets -- first deputy prime minister of the  Russian Government    Anatoliy Chubays -- chairman of the State Property  Committee    Yuriy Yarov -- deputy prime minister of the Russian  Government    Aleksandr Shokhin -- economy minister    Sergey Dubinin -- acting finance minister    Oleg Davydov -- foreign economic relations minister    Gennadiy Fadeyev -- transportation minister    Igor Shurchkov -- chairman of the State Committee for  Industry    Viktor Gerashchenko -- chairman of the Central Bank    Anatoliy Kruglikov -- chairman of the State Customs  Committee    Viktor Krunya -- chief of the Federal Currency and Export  Control Service    [no name as published]--minister for cooperation with CIS  countries</p>

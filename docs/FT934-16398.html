			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market report The COCOA market made a fresh attempt at breaking overhead resistance but, as on Monday, early gains were lost in the afternoon. 'It's been a funny old day - a bit like yesterday,' one trader said. 'Every time we run up a little, the market doesn't see any real follow-through buying.' The March futures position at the London Commodity Exchange ended Pounds 3 up at Pounds 970 a tonne, after touching Pounds 978 at one stage. At the London Metal Exchange ZINC trading slackened in the afternoon after a lively start. A speculative surge ran into overhead resistance above Dollars 920 a tonne for three months metal and the price ended after hours trading at Dollars 916 a tonne, up Dollars 13. The LEAD market moved away from early 20-year lows on late commission house buying and covering, although prices still finished softer following a morning mini-collapse. The final three months delivery price was Dollars 371 a tonne, down Dollars 7 on balance but Dollars 6 above the low. Despite 1994 consumer interest and option business, the market's short-term fundamentals were poor, with supply continuing to outpace demand, traders said. Compiled from Reuters</p>

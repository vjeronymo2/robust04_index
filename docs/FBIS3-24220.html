			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Sinologist V.S. Myasnikov by Andrey </F> Vinogradov; place and date not given: "Chinese Civilization Has  Proven Its Capacity for Survival"]    [Text] Vladimir Stepanovich Myasnikov is a well-known  Sinologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of  Sciences, deputy director of the Russian Academy of Sciences Far  East Institute, and leader of the Russia-China Center. The  author of more than 200 scientific works on the history of  Russo-Chinese and Soviet-Chinese relations and problems of the  development of countries of Northeast Asia.    [Vinogradov] Vladimir Stepanovich, you were a member of the  delegation that accompanied Kozyrev, minister of foreign affairs  of the Russian Federation, to China. In connection with the fact  that there was quite scant coverage of Kozyrev's trip in the  press, could you describe this visit in somewhat more detail? As  far as I know, the visit is seen in the Foreign Ministry as  having been exclusively successful. It did not seem so to me....    [Myasnikov] In order to evaluate the success of a visit it  is  necessary to compare the purposes that were set for it and the  results that were obtained.    This visit had been planned long since, but its preparation  was dragged out, and then the elections, formation of the  cabinet, and so forth were approaching. A decision was  ultimately made on a visit at government level by the foreign  minister. The main task consisted of two components. First,  following the visit of President Yeltsin, it was necessary to  conduct a stock-taking, as it were, of how the agreements were  being fulfilled. And, as practice shows, things are not moving  successfully in all directions. This inspection purpose was  combined with a desire to make good what had not been done  during President Yeltsin's visit. You know that he was unable to  go to Shenzhen, and a purpose of the visit, therefore, was a  trip to the free economic zones. Specifically, the area of Heihe  and Blagoveshchensk on the Russo-Chinese border, where it is  planned to create a joint zone. And, of course, Shenzhen--a zone  that has been in operation for 15 years now, which is the  best-known in China, and which has achieved excellent results.  The Chinese Government has decided, as you know, to make a  northern Shenzhen of Heihe.    [Vinogradov] These matters are more within the jurisdiction  of Shokhin, it would seem to me, not Kozyrev....    [Myasnikov] You are right. As I said, the visit of another  member of the government had been planned originally, but in  connection with various matters (I dislike the term "government  crisis") the most suitable figure in this case was the minister  of foreign affairs. But traveling with him were experts,  administration chiefs, people involved in actual economics....  And some of them, what is more, Ivanov, chief of the  Administration of Chita Oblast, and Volkov, chief of the  Administration of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast, say, had already  been to Shenzhen as part of the group accompanying the president.    The appropriate invitations were made to the Chinese side  during Yeltsin's visit for a return visit. But changes had  occurred in this time in the Chinese leadership also, and it was  necessary to extend an invitation to the new persons. In  addition, agreement was reached on the visit to China this  spring of Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, and problems of bilateral  relations, border problems primarily, were discussed. You know  that the transparency of the border and its openness and  penetrability are a two-edged sword. On the one hand this  stimulates border trade, on the other, a negative effect is  manifested also: The potential for crime increases. Quite broad  masses of representatives of the Chinese and Russian sides are  coming into direct contact, but these are not, to be blunt, the  best representatives of the two peoples. Prior to this, the  "main conduits of relations with China" with us were L. Tolstoy,  Gorkiy, a whole group of prominent Soviet writers, and so forth.  Their works and they themselves are known in China and treated  with great respect. Exhibitions of the Chinese artist Xu Beihong  were held in our country in the 1930's, and the actor Mei  Langfang, many theatrical ensembles, and so forth visited us.  Today this line of cultural relations is somehow dormant, and  quite a different line of interaction has emerged instead, which  is causing quite a good deal of negative consequences of a  purely psychological plane both in China and in Russia. The  nations' ideas of one another are changing, and not for the  better, what is more. This could create distorted stereotypes,  which would influence our countries' relations in the future, in  the 21st century. You know that, according to information of the  Chinese side, at the end of the past month there were over 2  million Chinese on the territory of Russia. This figure is  growing all the time. How many Russians, I cannot account for....    [Vinogradov] Quite a few also, particularly in Beijing. But  not millions, of course....    [Myasnikov] If we wish to achieve mutual understanding,  which  is very important for good-neighborliness and for the strategic  development of the relations of the two countries, order needs  to be brought to bear. This does not mean that we have to ban or  close down some things--we need elementary order at the state  level. And the Chinese side is better and more successful here,  as a rule. For example, they entrusted Heilongjiang Province  with dealing with Russia and the CIS. Everything is specialized  there: There is a permanent annual fair in Harbin and there is a  particular set of companies that pursue commerce. On our side,  on the other hand, total freedom, but not in the best meaning of  this word. It was decided as the first order of business,  therefore, to establish visa conditions.    [Vinogradov] As far as I recall, these matters were raised  in  the course of Sergey Shakhray's trip to China last July also....    [Myasnikov] Shakhray discussed primarily models of national  relations within the country. He was beginning his campaign as  leader of the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] at that  time. China is the same type of multinational country as Russia  and is typologically very close--the history of the creation of  the two states is very similar. True, Shakhray had a mandate  from the Siberian Accord public organization to discuss  questions of border cooperation also. But I believe that neither  he nor the Chinese side were prepared for a serious discussion.  In this case this is within the jurisdiction of the minister of  foreign affairs, minister of internal affairs, and minister of  state security.    [Vinogradov] As far as I know, the Chinese and Russian  Ministries of Security have signed an agreement on the mutual  extradition of criminals....    [Myasnikov] Yes, but besides this, a new agreement has now  been signed which amounts to the following: Persons who are  truly engaged in developing trade and economic, scientific and  technological, and other relations between China and Russia and  Russia and China have preferential conditions for crossing the  border. They may be issued multiple visas and one-year, two-year  passports. Obstacles are put in the way only of people engaging  in semi-legal and illegal business and making episodic raids on  the neighboring territory.    [Vinogradov] How is the one distinguished from the other?    [Myasnikov] I agree that making the distinction is  difficult.  Development will, obviously, be along the lines of the  consolidation of firms. If a firm has given a good account of  itself, its representatives will be granted preferential  conditions. I recall that we were visited here in the institute  by staff of the embassy and the trade mission of the PRC in  charge of economic problems, and they were severely critical of  us at that time: "You sign an agreement immediately with the  first Chinese who gives you his card. But this does not mean  that he is a person backed by a real business or administrative  structure. It is not hard to make calling cards in China."    [Vinogradov] I also have repeatedly taken part in such  "negotiations" which subsequently were not continued. More, when  I would attempt to find in Beijing the office of the "major  firms" with whom we had been negotiating in Moscow, this proved  more often than not to be a tiny stall.    [Myasnikov] For the entire world practice of the market  economy, checking out one's partner and his actual possibilities  is one of the main rules. Aside from the new rules of visa  conditions, therefore, other agreements will be signed also. But  not all at once. This needs to be done thoughtfully to avoid  foolish mistakes.    In addition, serious regional problems, the Korean problem  specifically, were discussed. As we all know, following the  meeting in Seattle, this has become a controlled problem, and  China is now performing a principal role in the achievement of a  balance of interests. The proximity of positions was discussed  and confirmed.    A second important question that was of interest to the  Russian side was Russia's participation in the Asia-Pacific  Economic Council (APEC). As we all know, a three-year moratorium  on the admittance of new members to the council was imposed in  Seattle. The question of the need to make an exception for  Russia was raised in the course of the visit. The Chinese side  took note of our wish.    [Vinogradov] But did not express a reciprocal wish to  actively support the Russian aspiration....    [Myasnikov] It cannot make such declarations immediately. I  can give you my viewpoint, which I conveyed to representatives  of the Chinese side before, during, and after the visit. We  should not be arguing along the lines of the "you help me, I'll  help you" principle, of course. The Soviet Union formerly did a  great deal for China's admittance to the United Nations. The  support was very strong, even in the confrontation years. We  refused to sign the San Francisco Treaty because the PRC had not  been invited. But this does not mean that China must today pay  us back. China should proceed from its own interests.    [Vinogradov] How far is it in China's interests to promote  an  increase in Russia's economic role in Asia, thereby creating  competition for itself and depriving itself of a monopoly  position in the sphere of contacts with the Russian Federation  to a large extent?    [Myasnikov] I will explain it this way. Very important  economic projects, in which China also has an interest, are  being advanced at the present time. The idea of the creation of  a free trade zone in Northeast Asia, say, which would encompass  China, Japan, the Korean peninsula, and Russia, has been mooted  for two years now. Without Russia it would be impossible to link  this zone with the North American Free Trade Area: Mexico,  Canada, and the United States, in Alaska. Could such a project  be realized without Russia's membership of APEC? Or, say, the  far-reaching "Yakut gas" project--the transfer of Yakut gas to  China and South Korea. I believe that this would be extremely  difficult on a bilateral basis. The Tyumenjiang project is also  part of these integration economic processes, and Russia's  participation is essential not only, of course, in the United  Nations, where this project is being stewarded, but in APEC  also. Of course, quite a tough struggle is under way in  structures of an economic kind, but common rules of the game for  this region should be formulated, and formulating such rules  without Russia would be unrealistic.    [Vinogradov] You always emphasize in your articles and  speeches that Russo-Chinese relations represent a zone of  contact of two different civilizations. To what extent are  psychological differences influencing specific bilateral  relations?    [Myasnikov] We are undoubtedly representatives of two  different civilization complexes. We will not say whose  civilization is the more ancient, this is not the issue. But for  an understanding of one's partner, an understanding of the  motives of his policy, and an understanding of his political  mentality a knowledge of civilization features is  extraordinarily important. I have the impression, what is more,  that the Chinese side has progressed further in this respect  than us. It is possible that the Sinologists, you and I, are at  fault here. The Chinese side is making very skillful use of the  particular features of the Russian mentality and knows history  well, which is a hallmark of far from all our representatives.    China is today laying the foundations of a new state of the  21st century, and its policy is pursuing long-term goals. The  main thing here is plan orientation and precise adherence to the  charted plans. And a particular feature of the Chinese  mentality, what is more, is the fact that the plans are  formulated by all the participants in the foreign economic  process. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs or some other body over  it may collate a whole number of proposals, but each  organization necessarily has its own plan of interaction with  its partners, which, as a rule, is not the case with the Russian  side. In a word, it is necessary in all situations to take  account of a whole number of salient features of Chinese custom  and the Chinese mentality.    [Vinogradov] In respect to the human rights problem, for  example....    [Myasnikov] If we are speaking of human rights, the  millennial experience of Chinese civilization and Chinese  philosophical social thought has formulated entirely different  criteria of the relationship of the individual and society, the  individual and the state. What are Western human rights today?  They are Protestant morals in generalized form. At the start of  the 19th century a number of founders of American democracy  formulated some basic parameters, in their opinion, of  democratic institutions for their country. They then embedded  some messianic character in these notions of theirs and began to  spread them to other countries. But inter-civilization  convergence should not even contemplate the imposition of one's  own historical experience. This is the mistake of the West  today: demanding that China conform to its ideas or adopt its  human rights legislation. It is necessary to perceive one's  partner in international relations as he is, not attempt to  remake him. Otherwise there will be conflicts. China understands  Western experience and studies it, but cannot adapt it in a few  years. There has to be a sufficient amount of time for an  evaluation of the moral principles of Protestantism also. From  China's viewpoint, they could seem absurd. After all, a  beautiful European opera could be perceived by the Chinese as  some preposterous cacophony. Just as Chinese traditional music  is not accepted by Europeans.    Political music is heterogeneous also. Of course, it is the  job of diplomacy to level these differences. But diplomatic  barriers cannot be crossed. The ideas of the Chinese concerning  human rights are shaped by Confucian precepts, which exist in  society. These are by no means communist inventions, against  which the West is struggling. The Chinese communists,  incidentally, have always made skillful use of their people's  traditional experience and have adopted it in propaganda and  ideological work. In the precepts that exist in China today  there is a very great deal that is purely traditional. Let us  take a look. A campaign to limit the birthrate is being  conducted in China at this time. This is the sole rational  policy possible in this country in this specific historical  period. And combating it from the standpoints of human rights,  as the American Congress has done at times, is to become  ridiculous.    [Vinogradov] The events in Tienanmen Square in 1989, for  example. I personally encountered in China the fact that even  liberals and intellectuals today justify the actions of the  authorities in that situation since this helped preserve  stability in society. Except for the students who took part in  these events themselves, almost no one in China now sees them as  some crime on the part of Deng Xiaoping and others. They regard  them as a tragedy, but historically necessary.    [Myasnikov] Yes, I also heard such opinions, and we need to  try to understand them. Remember the events in Kwangju, in South  Korea, when the students rebelled against the then Chon Tu-hwan  regime. After all, liberal thought did not condemn the South  Korean regime of that time for the shoot-up in Kwangju. Nor  during their visits did the prime ministers of China and Japan  condemn the events in Kwangju, but observed: There must be  stability in Asia. That is, stability at the state level, at the  level of international relations, was put above democratic  aspirations. This is the point. So let us leave things Western  to the West, things Eastern, to the East.    The West has been operating in the East for five centuries  now--since the times of the great geographical discoveries. And  throughout these centuries the West has continually attempted to  bring here at times Christian standards, at times, Catholicism,  but the foundations of the oriental civilizations have proven  quite strong. In addition, they are today undergoing a  renaissance, a positive renaissance, I would say, because the  "dragons" of East Asia have largely grown up in the soil of  Confucianism and traditional ideology. So we should not be  fighting inter-civilization differences, we should be adapting  to them.    [Vinogradov] What are the prospects of Russia's relations  with China? After all, according to some estimates, China has  today reached the position of the third economic power. China's  role and influence in the world are increasing, and its overall  might is growing. Is this not a challenge to Russia, for having  such a neighbor is far from safe....    [Myasnikov] We have today entered an entirely new historical  period, and we need to look at this with open eyes. China's rate  of development is outstripping that of Russia. Although many  people have yet to recognize this, we will have to build a new  model of relations with China. A particular feature of this  model is the fact that China is today the world's third economic  power, and the decline in production in Russia is continuing. I  do not believe that Russia will in a year or two in a sudden  spurt catch up with and overtake China. Russia is not today,  thank God, confronted with the task of catching up and  overtaking--its task is that of survival. It is under these  conditions that the new model of relations will take shape. Full  consideration of the national interests of Russia and the  civilization features of both Russia and China are needed here,  therefore, as are very well considered measures for the economic  development of our Far East and Siberian oblasts that abut China.    The book "21st Century--Age of Chinese Civilization" has  just  been published by the Renmin Chubanshe official publishers. A  very interesting book, which says that Chinese civilization is  superior to other civilizations in terms of the essential  characteristics, humanitarian parameters primarily, contained in  it. And this will ensure China's triumph in the 21st century on  a world scale. Without bloody clashes and without wars, mankind  will be forced to acknowledge the superiority of Chinese  civilization.    [Vinogradov] And if it does not so acknowledge it without  wars and clashes?    [Myasnikov] I realize that this could, perhaps, be an  extreme  viewpoint. But such viewpoints reflect a growth of national  self-awareness connected with economic growth, with the growth  of the might of the country and China's new world role. This is  the first point. Second, such forecasts usually appear in  periods of a millennium--a change in the span of 1,000 years.  Some are filled with eschatological sentiments: The end of the  world is nigh, others, on the contrary, see new horizons. I  believe that the horizons of the 21st century are, truly,  visible and that many of its parameters may be imagined quite  realistically even today. And China will, of course, perform a  principal role in the world arena as an economically,  politically, and, yes, culturally most powerful state....    [Vinogradov] Militarily also, I believe....    [Myasnikov] I proceed from the fact that military factors  will be on the wane in the 21st century. Nonetheless,  competition will develop primarily according to economic and  cultural indicators. In addition, China has one strategic trump  card, which was planned by Mao Zedong even and, perhaps, by  earlier rulers also--the size of its population. I do not  believe that it will diminish appreciably in the 21st century.    [Vinogradov] We need to take account also of the upcoming  unification with Hong Kong and, possibly, with Taiwan. In  addition, there is Singapore, where ethnic Chinese constitute 70  percent of the population.    [Myasnikov] Yes, the Great China idea. If these countries'  GNP's are added together, the result will be a supergiant.    [Vinogradov] There are, in addition, the huaqiao scattered  throughout the world....    [Myasnikov] The huaqiao mean relations with the whole world.  Plus a compact Chinese economic community furnished with all the  latest achievements of Western civilization and aware, what is  more, of its messianic role, if you will, in bringing the whole  of the rest of the world closer not to Protestant morals but to  Confucian values. Let us look at the Europeans, the Americans.  After all, many of them are enraptured by East Asian  civilization and culture. Those who know and perceive it.  Adaptation is taking place quite easily here also.    I believe, therefore, that the talk about the possible  disintegration of China at the national or economic, provincial,  administrative level--these are all hopes which are, perhaps,  desired, but which are unrealistic. Chinese civilization has in  the four millennia of its existence and written history proven  its exceptional capacity for survival.</p>

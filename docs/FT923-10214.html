			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / A leader beleaguered: The political bribery scandal in Brazil UNTIL recently, visitors to Braslia with Dollars 10 and a few hours to kill could amuse themselves with something called a Corruptour - a guided tour of the capital's 'most notorious dens of corruption'. High on the list was the presidential palace, Congress and the ministries of labour and health, former incumbents of both of which are under police investigation. The tourist authority, shocked by the image the tours gave of the country, banned them - but it is far harder to try to halt the torrent of corruption allegations filling the Brazilian press and threatening to unseat President Fernando Collor, whose position looks less and less tenable. Every day, new characters and new accusations emerge in the farcical saga which has emerged since May, when Mr Collor's younger brother first accused the charismatic young president of using his position to accumulate wealth. The resulting congressional inquiry into Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, friend and alleged front-man to Mr Collor, is drawing higher viewing figures for its televised daily hearings than the Olympic games. Now in its 10th week, the inquiry has collected a mass of material that is alleged to incriminate Mr Farias and Mr Collor, including 40,000 cheques and bank statements locked in a safe. These, it is claimed, show that Mr Farias had been running a multi-million dollar extortion racket and using the money to pay the president's expenses. They also show that Mr Farias has been meeting the maintenance payments for the children of Mr Collor's ex-wife, and funding the expensive clothing tastes of his current wife, despite Mr Collor's insistence that he has had no contact with Mr Farias since becoming president two years ago and that the deposits were in fact made by Mr Claudio Vieira, his former private secretary, out of a Dollars 5m loan raised in Uruguay in 1989. The latest nail in Mr Collor's coffin was hammered on Wednesday when the secretary of a Sao Paulo businessman said it was only last week that she had typed documentation purported to be related to the Uruguay loan, which is supposed to have been made three years ago. She said she had been driven to reveal 'Operation Uruguay' after being sickened by watching its instigators toast its success with champagne. Mr Collor was elected on an anti-corruption platform; few people now believe in his innocence. Mr Luis Bresser Pereira, minister of works in the last government, wrote in an article yesterday: 'The consensus of society is already formed - now all that remains is the consensus of the politicians, and we'll have the resignation or the impeachment of Collor.' Yet Mr Collor grimly refuses to resign, bolstered by the presence in his government of Mr Marclio Marques Moreira, the much respected economy minister. So far, the president has faced no real protests in the streets; Brazilians seem to believe all politicians are corrupt anyway. Indeed, Mr Collor has gone on the offensive. Claiming that the campaign is a 'conspiracy by coup-makers' and opponents of his economic reforms, he has formed a heavy squad, led by the president of the state-owned Banco do Brasil and threatening income tax investigations of Vice-President Itamar Franco (who would become president if Mr Collor were ousted), leading congressmen and presidential aspirants. Mr Collor hopes the whole episode will be swept under the carpet, in traditional Brazilian style, because of fears of where further inquiries might lead and of the destabilisation that a lengthy impeachment process might cause. But Brazil's main opposition parties have already decided to call for impeachment of the president after the inquiry concludes on August 11. Meanwhile, leading politicians are expressing their support for Mr Franco, and discussing the formation of a 'government of national unity' which would take office until a referendum next April on Brazil's future political system. There is much confusion over impeachment. The relevant part of the 1988 constitution has yet to be ratified. Specialists say impeachment would require two-thirds support in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Collor government is trying, through judicious spending of public money, to muster the 168 votes he would require to survive in Congress. His party holds only 23 seats out of 503 in Congress and, even with supporting parties, the government bloc totals only 123. Through it all, inflation stays above 20 per cent a month and much-needed fiscal reform remains delayed. Yet the political crisis has had some positive results. The inquiry has highlighted the hypocrisy of the law forbidding politicians to accept campaign contributions from business. Candidates in general rely heavily on donations from construction companies which stand to gain from future government contracts. Even more important - constitutional processes are functioning, despite Brazil's past of military rule, and the men in khaki are indicating no desire to step back into office. Mr Genebaldo Correia, congressional leader of the main opposition party, says: 'We're showing the world that Brazil is a strong democracy.'</p>

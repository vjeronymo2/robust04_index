These findings are made in recognition of the description of Federal and non federal responsibilities in Senate Report No. 96&hyph;52 (1980). On November 21, 1994, the Assistant Administrator for Airports approved Revision No. 2 to the Approved Noise Compatibility Program for Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. The one recommendation of the revision to be added to the approved program involving a permanent noise and flight track monitoring system was approved. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The effective date of the FAA's approval of Revision No. 2 to the Approved Noise Compatibility Program is November 21, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> David B.

The Act requires such programs to be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties including local communities, government agencies, airport users, and FAA personnel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each airport Noise Compatibility Program developed in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 150 is a local program, not a Federal Program. The FAA does not substitute its judgment for that of the airport sponsor with respect to which measures should be recommended for action. The FAA's approval or disapproval of FAR Part 150 program recommendations is measured according to the standards expressed in Part 150 and the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979, and is limited to the following determinations: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. The Noise Compatibility Program was developed in accordance with the provisions and procedures of FAR Part 150; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Program measures are reasonably consistent with achieving the goals of reducing existing non compatible land uses around the airport and preventing the introduction of additional non compatible land uses; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Program measures would create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, unjustly discriminate against types or classes of aeronautical uses, violate the terms of airport grant agreements, or intrude into areas preempted by the Federal government and; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Program measures relating to the use of flight procedures can be implemented within the period covered by the program without derogating safety, adversely affecting the efficient use and management of navigable airspace and air traffic control responsibilities of the Administrator prescribed by law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specific limitations with respect to FAA's approval of an Airport Notice Compatibility Program are delineated in FAR Part 150, Section 150.5. Approval is not a determination concerning the acceptability of land uses under Federal, State or local law. Approval does not, by itself, constitute an FAA implementation action. A request for Federal action or approval to implement specific Noise Compatibility Measures may be required. An FAA decision on the request may require an environmental assessment of the proposed action. Approval does not constitute a commitment by the FAA to financially assist in the implementation of the program nor a determination that all measures covered by the program are eligible for grant-in-aid funding from the FAA under the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982, as amended. Where Federal funding is sought, requests for project grants must be submitted to the FAA Airports Division Office in Hawthorne, California. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The city of Phoenix submitted on December 30, 1987, the Noise Exposure Maps, descriptions, and other documentation produced during the Noise Compatibility Planning study conducted from August 1986 through June 1989. The Noise Exposure Maps were determined by the FAA to be in compliance with applicable requirements on November 17, 1988. Notice of this determination was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on November 29, 1988. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The study contained a proposed Noise Compatibility Program comprised of actions designed for phased implementation by airport management and adjacent jurisdictions from the date of study completion to, or beyond, the year 1992. It was requested that the FAA evaluate and approve this material as a Noise Compatibility Program as described in Section 104(b) of the Act. The FAA began its review of the program on October 4, 1989 and was required by a provision of the Act to approve or disapprove the program within 180 days (other than the use of flight procedures for noise control). The Noise Compatibility Program was approved by the FAA on April 2, 1990. On May 27, 1994, the FAA began its review of Revision No. 2 to the approved program and was required by a provision of the Act to approve or disapprove the program within 180 days (other than the use of flight procedures for noise control). Failure to approve or disapprove such a program within the 180-day period shall be deemed to be an approval of such program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The submitted revision to the approved program contained one (1) proposed action for establishing a permanent noise and flight track monitoring system. The FAA completed its review and determination that the procedural and substantive requirements of the Act and FAR Part 150 have been satisfied. Revision No. 2 to the approved program, therefore, was approved by the Assistant Administrator for Airports effective November 21, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Outright approval was granted for the one (1) new Continuing Program Measure for provision for establishment of a permanent noise and flight track monitoring system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This determination is set forth in detail in a Record of Approval endorsed by the Assistant Administrator for Airports on November 21, 1994. The Record of Approval, as well as other evaluation materials and the documents comprising the submittal, are available for review at the FAA office listed above and at the administrative offices of the city of Phoenix, Aviation Department. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Hawthorne, California on December 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Robert C.

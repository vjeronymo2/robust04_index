			<p>930526 FT  26 MAY 93 / Letter: The 'nuisance' wealth creators Sir, I was astonished to read the comments by Professor Patrick Minford in Peter Marsh's article 'Salmon succeeds beer and sandwiches' (May 24). If an adviser to the Treasury can state, 'People from business are invariably a nuisance when it comes to talking about the economy', it explains much about the malign neglect and ignorance which our manufacturers have had to endure for many years. Does the professor believe that wealth is created from thin air, and where, if not from taxed wealth, does this bemused academic's salary come from?

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: Record term for Campbell Soup CAMPBELL Soup, the US food products group, said yesterday it had achieved record earnings and sales in the fourth quarter, buoyed by a strong contribution from overseas markets. Earnings and revenues for the full year also reached record levels for the fourth consecutive time. The results highlight Campbell's recent efforts to reorganise its global operations, as well as its renewed emphasis on its core soup, biscuits and bakery businesses. Net earnings in the quarter to August 1 were 11 per cent higher at Dollars 122m, or 48 cents a share, up from Dollars 109m, or 44 cents, in the corresponding period of 1992. Revenues in the period, which contained an additional week, rose 7 per cent from Dollars 1.4bn to Dollars 1.5bn. Before the cumulative effect of accounting changes, earnings in the 1993 quarter were 15 per cent up. For the full year, net earnings before special charges rose to Dollars 574m, or Dollars 2.28 a share, nearly 17 per cent higher than in the 1992 period. Sales rose by a less robust 5 per cent from Dollars 6.3bn to Dollars 6.6bn. Mr David Johnson, president and chief executive, attributed earnings growth to the 3 per cent global sales increase in the group's flagship soup business, coupled with a 31 per cent profits increase from its overseas businesses. However, the results from non-US operations were exaggerated by the group's acquisition in February of a 58 per cent controlling stake in Arnott's, the Australian biscuits business, after a bitter takeover battle. Arnott's contribution was included in the third and fourth quarters.</p>

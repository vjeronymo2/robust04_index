			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / World News in Brief: Playwright Eugene Ionesco dies Romanian-born French playwright Eugene Ionesco (left), one of a group of 'absurdist' writers whose work dominated postwar European theatre, died in Paris aged 81. Ionesco captivated audiences worldwide with a unique blend of black humour and farce. His most famous plays, La Lecon, Les Chaises, La Cantatrice Chauve and Rhinoceros were written in the 1950s. A militant anti-Communist, Ionesco campaigned from exile against former Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceaucescu. Obituary, Page 19</p>

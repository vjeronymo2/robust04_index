			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Sears Sales for the first 20 weeks of the current year at Sears were up 5 per cent on a like-for-like basis and 6 per cent overall against last year, Mr Geoffrey Maitland Smith, chairman, told the annual meeting. Difficult trading conditions in children's wear and sports and leisure were balanced by solid trading at British Shoe and Home Shopping and particularly strong performances from Selfridges and women's wear. The new concepts all continued to perform well.</p>

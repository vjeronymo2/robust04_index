			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Airbus set to launch new airliner - Dollars 300m A319 programme aims to beat Boeing in narrow-body market AIRBUS is expected to launch today a Dollars 300m programme to develop a smaller derivative of its 150-seater A320 twin jet airliner called the A319. Although the European aircraft manufacturer has not so far not received any substantial orders for the 130-seater A319, the consortium is anxious to to expand its family of narrow body aircraft before its big US rival, Boeing, launches later this year a new derivative of its 737 twin-engine airliner. Mr Dick Evans, chief executive of British Aerospace, a 20 per cent partner in Airbus, said yesterday the consortium wanted to expand its product base in the midst of the recession in civil aircraft manufacturing to be in a better position to take advantage of recovery in a few years time. Boeing, he noted, had launched in the past some of its most successful new aircraft programmes during a downturn in the highly cyclical commercial aircraft industry. So far only six A319s have been ordered, by the Californian aircraft leasing company ILFC. But the Airbus partners, which include Aerospatiale of France (37.9 per cent), Deutsche Aerospace (37.9 per cent), Casa of Spain (4.2 per cent) as well as BAe, believe a smaller version of the A320 would strengthen its competitive position in the narrow body airliners market. Deutsche Aerospace is particularly keen for the green light to be given for the A319 programme because it expects the new aircraft will provide a strong boost for the German civil aircraft industry. If the programme is launched, the new aircraft is expected to be assembled by Deutsche Aerospace at Hamburg where the other two Airbus narrow-body aircraft, the A320 and its larger 180-seat derivative the A321 are made. BAe, which employs about 10,000 people on Airbus work, would be responsible for the wings for the A319. The new aircraft is expected to enter commercial airline service in 1996. Mr Evans told a Financial Times aerospace conference on the eve of the Paris Air Show, that the Airbus partnership should be transformed into a public limited company which would become 'a truly integrated European business'. He urged the four Airbus partners to merge their Airbus operations, and said: 'The pooling of assets in a single company structure would enable a truly integrated production system to be managed.' But he acknowledged there were still significant national objections to overcome although it was now necessary for Airbus to move forward to compete in an increasingly concentrated commercial aircraft market. 'It is almost inevitable that in the US there will be two military aircraft and one large commercial aeroplane manufacturers against just the possibility of one of each in Europe,' he said. But Mr Louis Gallois, the chairman of Aerospatiale, told the conference that the transformation of Airbus into a public company remained a complex technical, industrial and political issue. He agreed, however, that it would ultimately be in the best interest of the European aerospace industry to see Airbus operate as an independent company even though the transformation was likely to take a long time. Mr Gallois said the recent decision of the new French government to privatise Aerospatiale was unlikely to have any direct impact on any eventual transformation of Airbus into an independent and integrated European company. But he conceded it would give the French group greater flexibility in negotiating alliances and partnerships with other aerospace and defence groups. Both Mr Evans and Mr Gallois saw an opportunity for Airbus to expand into the military sector.</p>

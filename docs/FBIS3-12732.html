Our  correspondent Ravid Bushinsky says that police forces at the  Temple Mount area and forces summoned to the area are removing  the youths without using force. It is assumed that the youths  are seeking to spend the night there in order to be among the  many worshipers who arrive for Friday prayers tomorrow and for  fear that the police will prevent youths from entering the  mosques.</p>

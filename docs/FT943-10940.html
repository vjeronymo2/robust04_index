			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / International Company News: Advisers chosen for Renault sale Banque Nationale de Paris and Lazard Freres are to be appointed as advisers to Renault for the partial or full privatisation of the state-owned car group. The mandate to advise the company is one of the most prestigious in the French government's plan to privatise 21 public-sector groups. Renault is valued at more than FFr40bn (Dollars 7.1bn), although a report last week by Lehman Brothers gave a valuation of FFr55bn to FFr60bn. The centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, is weighing the sale of part or all of its 80 per cent stake in Renault. It will appoint adviser banks, but a decision is not expected before Friday at the earliest. BNP and Lazards have close relations with Renault. Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault's chairman, sits on BNP's board, while the car group is a member of BNP's noyau dur of long-term stable shareholders. Lazards advised Renault during its ultimately unsuccessful negotiations with Volvo of Sweden concerning the merger of the two groups. The French government has yet to decide how and when Renault's capital will be opened to investors. However, many industry observers believe a partial privatisation, with stakes being taken by financial and industrial partners, could occur this year.</p>

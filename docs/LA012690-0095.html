			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DON'T OVERLOOK AFRICANS, POPE SAYS IN CAPE VERDE;  </P> <P> PILGRIMAGE: JOHN PAUL STARTS AN EIGHT-DAY TOUR. HE URGES THE HAVE NATIONS TO  REMEMBER THE HAVE-NOTS.  </P> <P> At the start of a pilgrimage to some of the poorest nations on Earth, Pope John  Paul II on Thursday asked the world community not to overlook Africa in its  preoccupation with sudden change in East Europe and the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Stiff winds and blowing sand greeted the Pope in this tiny island nation 300  miles off West Africa as he began an eight-day journey to five sub-Saharan  countries where per-capita income averages less than $220 a year.  </P> <P> Enthusiastic crowds waving white and yellow papal flags lined freshly tarred  roads to welcome John Paul to Praia, a city of 60,000 people and national  capital of this Rhode Island-size country. About 90% of Cape Verde's 364,000  people are Roman Catholic.  </P> <P> "This is probably the biggest day in Cape Verde's history," a diplomat in the  receiving line said.  </P> <P> In the golden days of sail, Cape Verde seamen, the descendants of Portuguese  colonists and African slaves, served as crewmen on board New Bedford whalers  and Yankee clippers. Today, many Cape Verdeans live in Rhode Island and  southern Massachusetts.  </P> <P> En route from Rome on his sixth visit to Africa and the 45th foreign journey of  his 11 years as Pope, the 69-year-old pontiff seemed relaxed and fully  recovered from a bout with the flu. He chatted with reporters, offering an  insider's glimpse of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit to the  Vatican last month. He said Gorbachev had applauded the concept of prayer, and  he added:  </P> <P> "I can say without betraying any personal secret that (Gorbachev) was very  pleased with the Pope's prayers. He said prayer was certainly a sign of  spiritual order, spiritual values, and that we have great need of these  values."  </P> <P> After two days in Cape Verde, John Paul will visit four countries on the  African continent -- Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Burkina Faso and Chad.  </P> <P> "This trip is especially dear to me," he said, "because we are going to meet  the poor in a desert region often called the Sahel. They are poor in an  economic, material sense. In a moral sense, poverty means wealth."  </P> <P> Responding to questions, the Pope said that developed countries working to  solidify changed East-West relations must maintain their economic commitment to  the have-not nations of the Third World.  </P> <P> "They cannot abandon their common and current responsibilities . . . for the  problems of the Third World," he said, "and for this I also thank providence  that at this time my journey is taking me precisely to Africa, to the Sahelian  countries. This is an act of providence."  </P> <P> Cape Verde, a former Portuguese colony, has no natural resources, yet it is the  richest of the five countries John Paul will visit. Per capita income is about  $400 a year.  </P> <P> Its economy is tied to subsistence agriculture on islands subjected to  prolonged droughts, and its people rely on foreign aid and remittances from  relatives living abroad.  </P> <P> The Pope, making the first of two African trips scheduled for 1990, asserted on  arrival his oft-expressed conviction that for there to be a just world, the  rich must help the poor.  </P> <P> "The Holy See and the Pope feel allied with Africa and other countries of the  Third World because we must present to the rich all the needs of the poor," he  told reporters. "We must insist on solutions. It's a question of solutions of  an individual and concrete type. How can you not cry out in certain  situations?"  </P> <P> John Paul is scheduled to fly this morning to the island of Mindelo, then move  on Saturday to Guinea-Bissau, his second stop.  </P></p>

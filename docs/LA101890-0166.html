			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLERKS, TRACKS AGREE TO SIGN TWO-YEAR-OLD CONTRACT  </P> <P> The union that represents all pari-mutuel clerks in California and the  organization that represents all of the race tracks have agreed in principle to  sign a labor contract that has been unsigned for two years.  </P> <P> Both Joe Stellino, president of Service Employees International Union Local  280, and Richard Hughes, director of industrial relations for the Federation of  California Racing Assns., said the contract will be signed in the next few  weeks.  </P> <P> "There are no problems; it's finally put together," said Hughes, who added that  there never was a problem. However, Hughes opened the latest skirmish by  sending a letter to Stellino saying he would request all tracks "to withhold  pension payments to the Building Service Employees Pension Trust" if the  contract was not signed by Oct. 1.  </P> <P> Stellino responded by letter: "If this action is taken by you, SEIU Local 280  will have no choice but to 'strike' all racing associations and satellite  facilities throughout . . . California."  </P> <P> The contract was ratified in 1988 but has not been signed because of  disagreements over the interpretation of specific language. The contract will  expire in two years.  </P> <P> A pari-mutuel clerk receives a base pay of $112 a day on-track after health and  welfare, pension and vacation deductions. An off-track clerk receives a base  pay of $90. There are about 2,400 union members in California. JOHN CHERWA  </P></p>

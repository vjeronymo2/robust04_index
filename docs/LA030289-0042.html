			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: TRIGGERING MORE GUN CONTROL FUROR  </P> <P> President George Bush, who wants to make this a kinder, gentler nation, moved  in the right direction recently when he said that he was not interested in  banning the importation of kinder, gentler semiautomatic weapons.  </P> <P> This declaration could not have come at a better time for the kinder, gentler  National Rifle Assn., which lists the President as a lifetime member. Not only  are the anti-NRA forces determined to stop the automatic weapons from being  sold, but the police around the country are complaining that they can't  maintain a benevolent and humane society when there are so many machine guns  available to the citizens.  </P> <P> It came as no surprise that Adolf Trigger, a gun dealer, was celebrating the  Bush decision. He told me, "The President has sent a message in his kind and  gentle way that as long as he is in office, Americans can buy any kind of gun  they want to, be it Czech, Chinese or Israeli."  </P> <P> I was glad to share in Adolf's happiness. "If I were leader of the Free World,  I would want to have a completely armed America, too. Only an unkind and  ungentle President would try to keep semiautomatic weapons out of the hands of  hunters and sportsmen. Bush doesn't want the weapons to be used against  schoolchildren, does he?"  </P> <P> "Of course not. Nobody wants children to be shot by semiautomatic weapons. The  President feels that we have to stop being so soft and lenient with our  criminals. Guns should only be available to law-abiding citizens who won't use  them to shoot each other in the back."  </P> <P> "The President has a warm and benign heart, but how can he stop sales if the  NRA fights any law requiring background information on a person buying a gun?"  </P> <P> "No one ever said that separating the good gun buyers from the bad ones was  easy," Adolf explained.  </P> <P> "Maybe the President will come up with a happy and sympathetic solution to the  problem. I'm sure he feels awful every time there's a massacre with a firearm."  </P> <P> "Mr. Bush would like to do something about it, but he feels that gun control is  an issue for individual states."  </P> <P> "Why?"  </P> <P> "That way he can devote all his time to talking about disarmament with the  Russians. If a person is working for a kinder, gentler world, he doesn't want  to be distracted with gang wars in his own back yard."  </P> <P> "Do you think that Mr. Bush really agrees with the semiautomatic gun  supporters, or is he just trying to placate them so that they won't get mad and  go out and mow down a nursing home?"  </P> <P> "George believes every word he says. He was a hunter long before he was a  President. When he was running for office, he promised the NRA that he would  never support any kind of gun registration because crime cannot be stopped by  finding out who owns a gun and who doesn't. I'm not saying that the NRA elected  him President of the United States, but we like to think that we were  responsible for his tender and merciful landslide."  </P> <P> "When Bush says that he will never do anything to prevent foreign hunting  machine guns from flooding the United States, is he threatening the domestic  gun industry?"  </P> <P> "No," Adolf replied, "because we don't manufacture semiautomatic guns in this  country. So, by importing the semiautomatics, we're not taking jobs away from  the American worker. All the President wants is to make sure that they are  available to the people who need them. That's why he will go down in history as  the kindest, gentlest President the NRA ever had."  </P></p>

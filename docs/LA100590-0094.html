			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> HOLLY-SEACLIFF DEAL NOW UP TO COUNCIL  </P> <P> The city's proposed Holly-Seacliff development agreement with the Huntington  Beach Co. has cleared a last hurdle before heading for City Council approval.  </P> <P> The Planning Commission voted 4-1 this week in favor of the agreement, which  the council will consider at a special meeting Monday.  </P> <P> Under the plan, forged during two months of intensive discussions, the company  will provide the city with 41 acres for a planned linear park.  </P> <P> But least two questions still must be resolved. Officials for the Huntington  Beach Co., which owns about 90% of the 750-acre Holly-Seacliff area, have  balked at demands to pay any fees that the city may impose in the future. For  example, the city is considering establishing a developer fee to create new  child-care facilities, which, under the existing proposal, the company would  not be obligated to pay.  </P> <P> Additionally, Commissioner Victor Leipzig, who voted against the pact, said he  was concerned that the agreement does not require the company to help pay for  the proposed northwesterly extension of Garfield Avenue, which would serve up  to 3,780 homes in the development.  </P> <P> Officials of the Huntington Beach Co. hope to finalize the agreement by the  Nov. 6 election, when three City Council members will be stepping down, said  Bill Holman, the firm's project manager.

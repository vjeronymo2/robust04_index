The hope that both countries would quickly get  closer to each other on the path of reconciliation after the  conclusion of the friendship and neighborhood treaty two years  ago has not been fulfilled. Rather, stagnation seems to have  become the main quality of mutual relations. In particular, the  unsolved issues from the time of the war and the immediate  postwar period have proved to be a constant strain on the  political atmosphere between Prague and Bonn. These include  compensation for the Czech victims of Nazism, but also the  "Sudeten German problem": the insistence of the Germans driven  out of Bohemia and Moravia on their "right to their home."    However, Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus does "not" assess  current German-Czech relations as being "as poor as various  commentators" in Prague. He does not see "anything dramatic" in  the bilateral relations, Klaus says in an interview with this  newspaper: "Czech-German relations are as they are. One cannot  improve them artificially, but one should not worsen them  artificially, either."    Klaus points out that there are hundreds of thousands of  contacts between Germans and Czechs everyday. These contacts at  the "micro level" are the "meat and blood" of the relations, and  they are excellent. The "network of microrelations" today is a  hundred times larger than two years ago and a thousand times  larger than five years ago. Therefore, he does not see a  deterioration of relations--"quite the contrary." Contacts  between institutions and governments are not the most important  thing, the head of the Prague Government says. At this level,  the Sudeten German problem has repeatedly caused displeasure on  both sides. The demands of the more than 3 million expellees for  a right to return and the return of their property, which Prague  had nationalized without compensation after the war, have been  categorically rejected by the Czech Government so far. Even  talks about this matter were refused. Most recently, Czech  Parliament President Uhde categorically refused any kind of  discussion on this matter during his visit to Bonn, thus  offending his host, Bundestag President Suessmuth.    The Czech prime minister said that the Sudeten German  problem  is an "unfortunate complication" that has been inherited. "For  us, it is quite clear: We cannot solve all of our inherited  problems right now. Various inheritances are constants of our  life, and solving the problems that arose from the situation  during the first days after World War II is part of that.  Unfortunately, we cannot accept the undermining of these  constants." However, for the first time, Klaus indicated an  alternative that might offer a way out of the stalemate. As the  head of government says, in the Czech Republic, individual  rights have priority over collective rights, and that also  applies to looking back into the past. "This is a principle of  our interpretation of life and reality." He, Klaus, is quite  sure that there will not be any solution for the "collective of  the Sudeten Germans": "Such a solution does not exist for me,  and therefore it is quite unnecessary to look for one. However,  I am quite sure that this problem can be solved at the  individual level. At this level, I do not see any problems for  the Sudeten Germans."    The head of government says that for him this is a "new  concept," the interpretation of which he first must develop  further for himself. "The terminology is completely new, and  this terminology can lead somewhere. The way out of the  stalemate is an individual solution, not a collective one. This  is a change in paradigms." However, this also means that the  Prague Government will continue to stick to its "no to  collective discussions" (with representatives of the expellees).    In Klaus's view, compensation for the Czech victims of  Nazism  is "certainly the German side's problem." His government is  dealing with the short-term question of how much is to be given  to the victims as a preliminary advance from the state budget as  long as they do not get anything from Germany. As an economist  and politician, he understands very well Germany's domestic  difficulties in the election year, "at this stage of economic  development and in view of high unemployment." Therefore, he  does not expect anyone in Germany to be powerful enough at the  moment to tackle the issue of compensation.    Klaus says that the same principle as for the restitution of  Jewish property or the restitution of church property must be  applied to compensation for the victims of the war: "We can only  attempt to alleviate the consequences of injustice that someone  has suffered." This is a rational and pragmatic concept "that  is acceptable for all of us." One must not understand the sums  that have been cited "as an objective yardstick of injustice."  As regards church property, his government is looking for a  mutually acceptable solution. The (coalition) partners must,  however, accept that "we cannot turn the world back to 24  February 1948. I cannot find a solution under the flag of the  restitution of property," the prime minister said.    The 53-year-old chairman of the Civic Democratic Party  (ODS),  unchallenged in heading the opinion polls, denies that there is  animosity toward the German neighbor. In his country, he has  never, not even over the past decades, "seen, heard, or found"  animosity toward Germany. Still, recently, it was a small  surprise for him to hear that the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra,  "a jewel of national pride," has a German as chief director. He  was taken aback a bit when he heard that. "However, the term  `animosity' really falls into a different category." Of course,  Klaus says, matters are different when speaking about fear or  fears of Germany. However, it is quite normal that the smaller  entity is a bit afraid of the larger one. Still, this is not an  aggressive attitude toward the Germans. "I do not expect  anything bad from Germany," the prime minister said.    Klaus does not care to heed warning voices, stemming mainly  from historians' circles, saying that the people in Bohemia and  Moravia know too little about the multifaceted nature of their  German neighbors. He is certain that the Czechs know more about  the Germans than 90 percent of the world's nations about their  respective neighbors. "Most certainly, our knowledge of German  history, literature, and current affairs is qualitatively much  better than German knowledge about the Czech Republic," Klaus  says. He states that demands for an institute for "German  studies" are "lobbyism."    Klaus also rejects the accusation that he is against  border-crossing cooperation. The Czech Government is for a  maximum of border-crossing cooperation as long as it takes place  at the "micro level--that is, the individual, companies, towns,  and communities." Prague is not against it when two border towns  jointly organize their sewer system. "I have said a hundred  times: Fine, do that, more quickly and better than today."  However, he is not a friend of regional cooperation. "Regions  are something unnatural for us. I always say that we must enter  Europe as a whole country and not as the European region of  Egrensis, the European region of Neisse, or the European region  of the Bohemian Forest."    Klaus says that, after the disintegration of Czechoslovakia,  his country is "slowly but zealously" searching for its  identity. It is still at the beginning of a process that must be  gone through and cannot be anticipated with analytical  definitions. The foreign policy goals of the Czech Republic, on  the other hand, are completely clear. "We belong and have always  belonged to the Central European area, not to the East European  area or even to the Balkans." Conclusion are drawn from that,  such as the desire to join all important European institutions.    Desirous of becoming a member of the European Union (EU)  and,  at the same time, being one of the most prominent critics of  European "excess bureaucratization"--Klaus does not see any  contradiction in that. These are two sides of the same coin. The  Czechs have fears that are linked to their past: "We know what  integration in a community with a capital that is 2,000 km away  means. There are very few opportunities to change things when  nonelected bureaucrats sit and have great power." He, Klaus,  "certainly does not" compare "the absolute aspects of the EU  with Soviet hegemony. However, from the structural viewpoint,  there are various things there that I can compare." Recently,  he agreed with the president of the European Parliament that the  ratio of nonelected officials within the EU must be changed for  the benefit of elected officials.    The Czech prime minister also energetically defends himself  against the accusation, primarily from Poland, that Prague  refuses cooperation with the other Central European states.  Indeed, Klaus does not like to use the term "Visegrad" (the  informal association of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and  Slovakia): "We speak ofCEFTA (the planned Central European Free  Trade Association)." It is the Czechs who are pushing this  project ahead and who have problems pulling the others along.  The members of the Visegrad Group as well as Germany and Austria  are natural partners, with whom one wants to have the best  conceivable relations.    And what about Slovakia? Is the relationship with Bratislava  already considered "business as usual" by Prague, or is there  still a "special relationship"? "A bit of both," the Czech  prime minister says. Thus, the dissolution of the common state  is already so far in the past for the Czechs that he, Klaus, has  forgotten to mention it abroad several times. On the other hand,  he regrets the negative developments in Slovakia. At the moment,  there is no one in Slovak politics strong enough to overcome the  instability there. Unfortunately, one must still wait for a  solution to the crisis in Bratislava. In other fields, too,  Klaus, who is married to a Slovak, crosses his fingers to the  former "brothers": for the Olympic ice hockey game--as long as  they do not play against the Czechs, one may assume.</p>

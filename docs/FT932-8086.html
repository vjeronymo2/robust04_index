			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: RJB goes to market valued at Pounds 103m RJB MINING, the privately owned coal company which aims to take advantage of the restructuring of the British coal industry, is being floated on the stock market with a value of Pounds 103m. The shares were priced yesterday at 250p. This represents a multiple of 11 times earnings for 1992, excluding interest on the finance raised to buy the company out the year before. The price also reflects a notional gross dividend yield of 5.75 per cent. Just under half the company's shares, or 20m, are being offered for sale, and 13.3m of these have been firmly placed. Of the Pounds 50m proceeds, Pounds 24.3m net will go to the company to repay bank borrowings and provide additional working capital. Existing shareholders will receive Pounds 23.5m of cash. After the sale the principal shareholders will be Schroder Ventures with 28 per cent, Charterhouse with nine per cent and Mr Richard Budge, the chief executive, with 10 per cent. Deadline for applications is 10am on May 27. Dealings start on June 7. The Union of Democratic Miners took the unusual step yesterday of backing the flotation, with a call for British Coal to speed up negotiations to sell unwanted pits to companies like RJB. Mr Neil Greatrex, UDM President, said: 'Budge are convinced that they have the markets for coal and we support them. But unless a decision is made soon, this will be yet another lost opportunity for the industry.' COMMENT With no obvious point of comparison in the market, the pricing of RJB presents something of a problem. But the indications are that underwriters BZW are erring on the side of caution. The Pounds 103m price tag is at the low end of the Pounds 100m-Pounds 120m range being bandied about. The earnings multiple is also below the average for the industrial materials sector, and the yield is slightly higher. This reflects partly the heavy demands currently being placed on the market, and also the uncertainty in RJB's prospects. If it fails to capitalise on the changes in the coal industry it will be left to the mercy of British Coal. But if it succeeds it could emerge as the country's leading low cost producer. The flotation is an opportunity to take a bet on the outcome.</p>

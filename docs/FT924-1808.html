			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Thames completes UK Gold funding with BBC THAMES TELEVISION and the BBC yesterday completed the funding of UK Gold, the British satellite television company based on popular repeats. TCI, the largest cable television operator in the US and with US West one of the largest in the UK, has taken a 27 per cent stake in the Pounds 35m venture - Pounds 25m cash and a Pounds 10m standby fund. The BBC has a 20 per cent stake, Thames 15 per cent plus an option for a further 5 per cent and Cox, the large US media company, 38 per cent. TCI is also involved in cable programming through channels such as Discovery, the factual channel, Bravo, the classic movie channel, and the Children's Channel. UK Gold is based on the programme libraries of Thames and the BBC and shows early episodes of programmes such as Casualty, The Bill, EastEnders and Dallas. It is the start of the development of a 'secondary market' in UK programmes  -creating a channel specifically dedicated to showing library material. The channel, launched on November 1, attracted an average weekly reach in multi-channel homes of 41.2 per cent equal, UK Gold estimates, to about 2.75m adults. Nearly half of UK Gold's viewing comes from 16-34 year-olds, a higher proportion than either ITV or Channel 4.</p>

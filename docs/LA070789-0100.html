			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANISCHEWITZ ACCEPTS BID BY INVESTOR GROUP  </P> <P> Matzo maker B. Manischewitz Co. said Thursday that it has agreed to a sweetened  takeover bid by a Beverly Hills investment firm that topped a "best and final"  offer from a rival kosher products firm.  </P> <P> Manischewitz late Wednesday accepted an offer of $841 a share, or $44.6  million, by Levine, Tessler, Leichtman &amp; Co. That bid surpassed by $1 a  share an enhanced offer by National Foods, the distributor of Hebrew National  products.  </P> <P> Last month, Jersey City, N.J.-based Manischewitz tentatively approved a  $40.1-million acquisition offer from Levine Tessler. That agreement, however,  was scuttled by a legal challenge that National Foods mounted to give it more  time to put together a new deal.  </P> <P> In a prepared statement, Manischewitz said the new Levine Tessler bid not only  was higher than National Foods' revised offer, but also could be completed  sooner. Manischewitz said the company plans to hold a shareholders meeting July  14 or soon thereafter to vote on Levine Tessler's offer.  </P> <P> A National Foods investment adviser could not be reached Thursday, and Arthur  E. Levine, chairman of Levine Tessler, declined to comment.  </P> <P> The higher bid appeared to be a victory for Jeffrey M. Herr, a longtime  Manischewitz director who had frequently cast the sole dissenting vote in board  meetings held to consider Levine Tessler's proposed deal. He had contended that  the offer was too low and was unfair to shareholders.  </P> <P> Manischewitz, founded 101 years ago by a rabbi in Cincinnati, makes a full line  of kosher foods for Passover and daily use. In addition to matzo, the products  include gefilte fish, borscht and chicken and vegetable soups. Since 1933, the  Manischewitz name has also been licensed for use on wine.  </P> <P> For the year ended July 31, 1988, Manischewitz reported net income of $2.9  million on sales of $30.1 million.  </P></p>

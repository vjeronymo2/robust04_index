			<p>BFN     [Text] Rafah, 12 May (MENA) -- Tonight, Israel agreed to  allow the rest of the Palestinian police force, the third batch,  into the autonomy areas through the Rafah crossing point.    Israel previously allowed only 99 of 450 members of the  third  batch through, for reasons that Israel claimed were technical.    Staff Major General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Majaydah, commander of  the Palestinian forces, stated that Israel decided to prevent  popular receptions for the Palestinian people to welcome their  returning forces.    He said an agreement was reached between the Palestinian and  the Israeli sides to allow 250 members of the Palestinian police  to cross tomorrow morning through the Rafah border post. The  forces in Jordan will also enter through the Allenby Bridge.    He added that other forces will arrive from Libya, Sudan,  and  Algeria. They will all gather in Rafah to prepare to enter the  autonomy areas in stages following the approval of the Israeli  side.    [In a related report, Paris AFP in English at 0601 GMT on 13  May adds the following: "Three hundred Palestinian policemen  crossed into the West Bank from Jordan overnight and headed by  bus for the Gaza Strip under Israeli army escort, a military  spokesman said Friday.    ["The men from the Palestine Liberation Army (PLA) will join  300 of their comrades who arrived in two groups on Tuesday and  Wednesday nights through the Rafah border from Egypt.    ["`They crossed the Allenby Bridge early this morning and  will probably enter Gaza from the south,' the spokesman said.    ["They belong to the PLA's "Badr" brigade stationed in  Jordan  and were driving down the Dead Sea, up through the Negev desert  and across west to the Strip.    ["The men were armed but without munitions, which were held  only by one officer on each of the 10 buses."]    ["Another 386 policemen, formerly based in Iraq, were due to  follow later Friday, as the Israelis relinquish control of the  West Bank town and the Gaza Strip to the Palestinians under the  autonomy deal signed on May 4.    ["And 300 more Palestinian police had been stuck all night  at  the Rafah border because of what PLO officials described as `a  big problem', but refused to elaborate.    ["Palestinian sources said the Israeli authorities objected  to certain names among the 300 and that a major argument  ensued."]</p>

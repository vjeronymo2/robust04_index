			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Court told of Hatton 'backhanders' MR DEREK Hatton, the former deputy leader of Liverpool City Council, lobbied Labour councillors in Liverpool to influence land deals in return for illegal 'backhanders', the Crown Court at Mold, Clwyd, was told yesterday. Mr Hatton, with Mr John Nelson and Mrs Hannah Folan, also former Labour councillors, and businessmen Mr Roy Stewart and Mr John Monk, deny charges of conspiracy to defraud the council. Mr Alan Rawley QC, prosecuting, said three pieces of city-owned land had been disposed of - two to Mr Monk and one to Mr Stewart - without being advertised for tender. He said Mr Hatton prevailed on Mr Nelson and Mrs Folan to make sure the businessmen got the land. 'Mr Hatton was rewarded handsomely for his efforts both by Mr Monk and Mr Stewart, and some of the rewards flowed onwards to Mr Nelson and Mrs Folan,' he said. Mr Rawley described how Mr Stewart and Mr Monk became clients of Settleside, a public relations company set up by Mr Hatton shortly before he ceased to be a councillor in March 1987. Mr Rawley said Mr Nelson had called for a council report on a piece of land. But officers sent the document to a subcommittee, of which he was not a member, which voted correctly for the land, a car park site, to be put out to tender. Mr Nelson ordered officers to telephone Mr Monk, who offered Pounds 10,000 a year for a car park licence for the site. This was accepted by a subcommittee. Mr Rawley said there had been no other offer for the land. The case continues today.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Milosevic faces a party split The Serbian president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, yesterday faced a rebellion within his ruling Socialist Party from opponents who accused him of serious misrule culminating in the United Nations trade and oil embargo. Their move coincided with more street battles in the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, where many residents, including Serbs, face starvation. The split in Mr Milosevic's party was led by 12 socialist deputies in the Serbian parliament who said they would leave the party of ex-communists and set up their own political organisation unless there were fundamental changes. 'We hope above all to bring about changes within the party, or to be more specific, changes to the party's direction,' Mr Jovan Cvetkovic, one of the rebel deputies, told Tanjug news agency. The deputies criticised the party for the way it hastily created a new Yugoslav state in April, its poor handling of the crisis and its relations with the dispirited federal army and the opposition. In Sarajevo, fighting broke out towards midday after Serb forces held their fire during the night. Residents described the renewed fighting as intermittent shelling, less intense than on Monday when Sarajevo's Moslem, Serb and Croat defenders, defying a two-month siege by Serb irregulars, staged their first counter-offensive after three days of blistering Serb bombardments.</p>

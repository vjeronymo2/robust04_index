			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Russia in Crisis: US wants Russian summit - Washington convinced emergency meeting on aid is needed THE US government is now convinced that an emergency summit of leading industrialised nations to consider aid to Russia is both desirable and probably inevitable. Until now, the administration has publicly confined itself to supporting a special meeting of G7 finance and foreign ministers, still likely to take place some time next month. But senior officials have taken careful note of growing pressure from President Francois Mitterrand of France, Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany for more immediate action. Mr Kohl is in Washington to see Mr Clinton later this week and Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, meets Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, in Washington today. President Bill Clinton meanwhile has been prepared to move next month's meeting with Mr Boris Yeltsin from Vancouver to Moscow or any other venue requested by the Russian president. But the Russian government indicated yesterday that this idea had been dropped. Mr Clinton's advisers are becoming increasingly irritated that Japan still apparently wishes the annual G7 economic summit, which is to take place in Tokyo in July, to be the principal forum for discussing aid to Russia. They believe the immediate imperative of putting together an aid package far transcends Japan's territorial dispute with Russia over the Kurile islands and its determination not have the annual summit upstaged. Some cannot understand why Japan has not settled its differences with Russia. Such an aid package would be intended to demonstrate support for Mr Yeltsin as the best hope for continuation of economic reform in Russia. But in a speech in Chicago on Monday, Mr Christopher sought to draw some fine distinctions between backing for Mr Yeltsin in particular and for the reform process in general. While staunch in his approval of the Russian president, he also said, with some nuance, 'our engagement with the reformers must be for the long haul, whether they're out as well as whether they're in, whether they're down as well as when they are up'. But officials concede that it is difficult to find in Russia alternatives to Mr Yeltsin to keep the momentum for reform going. Mr George Stephanopoulos, the chief White House spokesman, is careful never to identify in his daily briefings others in whom the US might be willing to place confidence. Mr Clinton's attachment to Mr Yeltsin, often compared to President George Bush's support for Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the president of the former Soviet Union, is attracting some critical fire. Yesterday, Dr Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state, wrote in the Washington Post that 'the US must not tie itself to any one leader of any one government in Russia.' He said that he personally preferred Mr Yeltsin, 'but I also believe he must be able to stay in office by his own efforts and not through foreign exhortations that could easily backfire.' Senior administration officials are prepared for the fact that if Mr Yeltsin does fall a degree of blame will be attached to Mr Clinton. It was partly for this reason that the president, contrary to the advice of some of his advisers, chose to hold his first formal press conference yesterday, knowing that Russia would dominate the questions but insistent on being given the opportunity to explain his approach in detail. In the event, at his press conference Mr Clinton walked a similar line to Mr Christopher's. He endorsed Mr Yeltsin as fulsomely as might be expected but emphasised that the greater US vital stake lay in promoting the reform process in Russia 'with or without Yeltsin.' Asked how he would characterise the US ability to influence the immediate course of events in Moscow, he was equally careful. 'We are not a bystander,' the president insisted, since Russian reform needed US assistance. But ultimately the fate of Mr Yeltsin was 'in the hands of the Russian people'.</p>

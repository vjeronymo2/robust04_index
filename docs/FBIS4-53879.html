			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "ASEAN's new bully boy"] </F>   [Text] As if twisting Philippine President Fidel Ramos'  arm into imposing a ban on all foreign participants from  attending the Asia-Pacific Conference on East Timor was not  enough, Indonesia has now detained 250 Filipino fishermen for  allegedly poaching in their waters, in a bid to get the  conference canceled altogether.    The Filipino fishermen from South Cotabato were reportedly  operating along the Philippine-Indonesian border and reports  reaching Manila indicate that they are being "detained and  harassed" in Indonesia.    On Friday, President Ramos ordered the Bureau of Immigration  to ban foreigners attending the Manila conference scheduled  between May 31-June 4 in a bid to appease the Indonesian  government. This rather unfortunate action was taken after  special envoy Raul Manglapus failed to mollify an angry Jakarta  on why the Philippines could not cancel the meeting of NGOs and  academics. Manglapus explained that it would be  unconstitutional to do so because the Philippine Charter allows  for freedom of association and free speech like all truly  civilized nations of this world.    But free speech and freedom of association and respect for  the constitution are completely alien to the Suharto government.  Because of this, before Ramos made his decision on Friday,  Jakarta had already resorted to the following acts of diplomatic  blackmail to show its displeasure: -- Threatened to scrap a  meeting scheduled for mid-June in Jakarta arranged by Indonesia  between the Philippine government and a Muslim separatist group,  the Moro National Liberation Front, to end more than 20 years of  fighting between the rebels and Manila; -- Forced a number of  industrialists affiliated with the local chapter of the  Indonesian Chamber of Commerce in Samarinda, East Kalimantan, to  cancel a planned investment involving billions of dollars in 15  strategic sectors in Davao, Philippines; -- Forced three  Indonesian business delegations to cancel their trips to the  Philippines, and a visit to Manila by a student delegation from  Jakarta's Jayabaya University was put on hold in reaction to the  Manila conference; -- Forced 200 Indonesian businessmen to  withdraw from a regional conference due to be held this week in  the southern Davao city to flesh out President Ramos' East Asia  Growth Area (EAGA).    It seems that Indonesia now is acting like the region's  bully  boy and rather unfortunately Ramos has allowed the Philippines  to be cowed into toeing the Jakarta line over East Timor.  Indonesia's actions over the week are not the true mark of a  regional leader, but rather that of a regional thug.    Till the November 1991 Dili massacre, in which scores of  East  Timorese were shot dead in front of Western journalists, East  Timor was the typical story of a war in the Third World -- a  messy struggle in a faraway country of the sort that perhaps  makes headlines in the West for a day or two, then gradually  slips out of view and out of mind.    Jakarta quite clearly wants misinformation and lies to  prevail over the truth of its invasion and forceful annexation  of East Timor in December 1975. The fact of the matter is that  within a few weeks close to 60,000 Timorese were killed -- 10  per cent of the population -- when Indonesian commandos invaded  the island. Since 1975, aid agencies have estimated that  200,000 East Timorese have died from various causes. The sad  fact is that civilized Western countries share the guilt of this  slaughter by virtue of actively giving the Suharto government  military and diplomatic support in its monstrous war crimes,  support given in the name of the crusade against international  communism.    The East Timor issue has been silenced for two decades, but  it would be wishful thinking on the part of Jakarta to expect it  to continue to be silenced now in the region.</p>

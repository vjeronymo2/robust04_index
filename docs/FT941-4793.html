			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Cash call rumours hurt BAT Rumours of a record-breaking rights issue settled on BAT Industries, the tobacco and insurance conglomerate. Many analysts were sceptical but BAT's share price tumbled 23 to 470p on heavy turnover of 8.6m ahead of figures due today. The speculation was that Compagnie de Suez would sell its Groupe Victoire insurance arm. BAT refused to comment publicly but was believed to have refuted the story to City analysts, while Suez denied that it was selling its stake. One analyst said the speculation had a 'superficial charm' because BAT was known to be trying to extend its financial services operations in continental Europe. However, it was also pointed out that BAT had not made a paper-funded acquisition for 20 years. Some cynical marketmakers felt predictions that BAT planned a two-for-nine cash call to raise Pounds 2.6bn had an over-precise ring. If true, it would be twice the size of the existing rights issue record of Pounds 1.3bn set up by Zeneca in June last year. Others argued that the market rarely reacts without a reason, and that rumours of a link had been building for some time. Another market favourite for a possible equity fund-raising was Cadbury Schweppes, which also reports results today. The company would need in excess of Pounds 1bn to mount a bid for Dr Pepper, of the US. The Cadbury share price was steady at 494p.</p>

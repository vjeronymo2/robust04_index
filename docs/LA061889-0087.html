			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FATHER EDWARD SORIN CAME FROM FRANCE;  </P> <P> THE MAN WHO FOUNDED NOTRE DAME  </P> <P> In the center of the campus of the best-known Catholic university in America is  a larger-than-life statue of a man with a white beard that flows to his waist.  </P> <P> The man is Edward F. Sorin, a Catholic priest who came to America from France  in 1841. A year later, at age 28 and a bankroll of $300, Father Sorin founded  the University of Notre Dame du Lac (Our Lady of the Lake).  </P> <P> Sorin dedicated the university to the Blessed Virgin Mary and vowed: "When this  school, Our Lady's school, grows a bit more, I shall raise her aloft, so that,  without asking, all men shall know why we succeeded here.  </P> <P> "To that lovely lady, raised high on a dome, a golden dome, men may look and  find the answer."  </P> <P> Ever since 1888, when Sorin's huge golden dome was erected on top of the  school's administration building, students here have been known as the "Golden  Domers" or simply "Domers."  </P> <P> Crowned by a 19-foot-high, gold-leaf statue of Notre Dame, the Golden Dome is  part of Sorin's legacy. And recently releafed, the Dome appears more lustrous  than ever.  </P> <P> Sorin served as Notre Dame's president until 1865. Then he became  superior-general of the Congregation of Holy Cross priests who teach and  administer the school. He was also chairman of the university's board of  trustees and played a key role in Notre Dame's leadership until his death in  1893.  </P> <P> His imprint is everywhere on the 12,500-acre campus, including Sorin Hall, the  school's oldest dormitory. He started the school band, one of the oldest  university bands in the country.  </P> <P> In the 1850s, all locales with a Post Office appeared on official government  maps. To make sure his school was on the maps, Sorin applied for -- and was  granted -- a Post Office in 1851. Sorin was the first postmaster and Notre Dame  has had a Post Office ever since.  </P> <P> President Reagan officially unveiled the Knute Rockne commemorative stamp at  the Notre Dame Post Office on March 9, 1988 -- the first U.S. stamp ever to  honor an athletic coach.  </P> <P> Because he played "The Gipper" in the Warner Bros. 1940 movie "Knute Rockne --  All-American," the former President considered himself an honorary alumni. He  delivered the commencement address here in 1981, when he and Pat O'Brien, who  played Rockne in the film, were given honorary degrees.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rockne Died in Plane Crash  </P> <P> Rockne, a chemistry professor, was head football coach at Notre Dame from 1918  until he was killed in a 1931 airplane crash at 43. His teams won 105 games,  lost 12, tied five. Five Rockne teams went undefeated, six lost one game, two  were national champions. His lifetime winning percentage of .881 ranks at the  top of the list for college and pro football coaches.  </P> <P> Though the game put Notre Dame on the map, there is more to the campus than  football. On a wall in school publicist Dennis Moore's office, and in many  places on campus, is a photograph of a football and this message underneath:  "If this is all you know about Notre Dame, you have a lot to learn."  </P> <P> Ranked 18th academically among America's 204 national universities in a recent  U.S. News and World Report survey, Notre Dame attracts more than $20 million a  year in research funding, primarily in science and engineering. It is a  significant figure given that university has neither a medical complex or  agricultural school.  </P> <P> The aerodynamics of glider flight and transmission of wireless messages were  pioneered at Notre Dame. Formulas for synthetic rubber were discovered here.  The university is a world leader in radiation chemistry and gerontological  research. Notre Dame Press is the largest Catholic university press in the  world.  </P> <P> Located next to the Golden Domed Administration Building and also completed in  1888 is the French Gothic church Sacred Heart. Designed by Sorin and Brother  Charles Harding, Sacred Heart is patterned after the main church in Sorin's  hometown, Aluille, France.  </P> <P> Sorin maintained close ties with France and the Vatican, making 52  transatlantic crossings in his lifetime. In 1874, during a visit to Rome, he  convinced Pope Pius IX to grant Vatican artist-in-residence Luigi Gregori a  two-year leave to go to Notre Dame. Gregori stayed 17 years, becoming Notre  Dame's artist-in-residence.  </P> <P> He did all the church's frescoes as well as a series of 12 paintings in the  Administration Building depicting scenes from the life of Christopher Columbus.  Each is 11 feet high and 5 1/2 to 9 feet wide.  </P> <P> Last year, 92% of the students were Catholics. Co-ed since 1972, today women  compose one-third of the student body and minorities account for 13%. Students  come from all 50 states, and 60 countries. The 1988-89 enrollment totaled 7,500  undergraduates, 1,300 in the graduate program and 850 in law school.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Once Had Own Mortuary  </P> <P> Notre Dame had an agriculture school until 1932, when both the school and the  campus farm were discontinued. For years, the university was self-sufficient in  many ways. It even had its own mortuary and hearse to handle burials in the  school cemetery.  </P> <P> The 14-story Theodore M. Hesburgh Library is the largest collegiate library  building in the world. Hesburgh, 72, the university's 15th president, retired  two years ago after 35 years on the job.  </P> <P> Hesburgh was also an international leader. President Eisenhower appointed him  to the U.S. Civil Rights Commission in 1957; President Reagan sent him to El  Salvador to oversee the elections in 1982. And Pope Pius XII sent him to Vienna  in 1956 to represent the Vatican at the International Atomic Energy Agency.  </P> <P> Hesburgh's successor, the Rev. Edward "Monk" Malloy, 47, like all previous  presidents of the school, is a member of the Congregation of Holy Cross. There  are 405 priests in the religious order, most connected with Notre Dame. The  president of the school is always selected from the ranks.  </P> <P> Malloy, who played basketball for Notre Dame on an athletic scholarship, has  been a professor since 1974. He lives austerely in students' quarters in  century-old Sorin Hall. He likes to tell the story of his first few months as a  student at Notre Dame:  </P> <P> "I flunked math and engineering drawing my first semester. I was .1% from  flunking out of the university. I went on to become president of the school I  almost flunked out of. So, there is hope. . . ."  </P></p>

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / International Company News: Overseas units behind sharp rise at Citic China International Trust and Investment Corporation (Citic), the Chinese investment conglomerate, sharply increased profits last year to Yn3.35bn (Dollars 389.5m), compared with Yn380m in 1992. Citic, which is rapidly developing its domestic and international business, attributed the improved performance to a bigger contribution from overseas subsidiaries and stronger domestic management. The company, established in 1979 as a channel for foreign investment in China, continued in 1993 to increase international borrowings, raising Dollars 440m in the international debt markets. This takes to Dollars 2bn the amount raised abroad in 18 bond issues. Among Citic's 1993 capital raisings was a Dollars 250m 10-year bond in the US. Citic's assets at the end of last year stood at Yn82.8bn against current and long-term liabilities of Yn73.3bn. Citic managers say they are committed to reducing indebtedness, but acknowledge this will not be easy in the present growth phase. Mr Wei Mingyi, Citic's chairman, writing in the company's annual report, commended the performance of Citic Australia which had been 'profitable' for the past six years. He added that the Hong Kong-based Citic Pacific was one of the colony's fastest-growing enterprises, and Citic Industrial Bank doubled profits last year. Mr Wei described 1994 as 'crucial for China'. Citic's priorities this year, he said, would be to improve management and expand its business in such new fields as finance, insurance, securities and fund management. It would also push ahead with the development of the Daxie Island economic development zone off the the coast of Zhejiang province. Citic plans to invest some Yn4bn in Daxie's infra-structure and is seeking a further Yn20bn from foreign investors.</p>

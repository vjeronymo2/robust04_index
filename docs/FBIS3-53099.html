During the meeting, Brother 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih greeted  those attending and through them all the sons of the  governorate. He referred to the daily concerns of the sons of  our Yemeni people and their tribulations as a result of the  crisis our country is experiencing at this stage of its history.  He said that he has taken note of what many sons of the  governorate have spoken about, and who have aired their concerns  during this meeting.    He said: I would like to thank my brothers, the sons of this  governorate who have contributed to the success of the large  popular gathering in the governorate through which they have  emphasized their concern for the unity of the homeland and the  cohesion of its sons, and blessed this gathering, which is a  positive and effective sign and an example the other  governorates should emulate to voice their views and air their  concerns on the crisis the homeland and unity are experiencing  in these circumstances.    The brother president spoke about the causes of the current  political crisis in the country. He said: We know very well  who has fabricated this crisis that has greatly harmed our  national economy and has created a rift in national unity. The  brother president reviewed the efforts that were exerted to  reunite the homeland, a strategic objective of the Yemeni  revolution and the most cherished achievement recorded by the  Yemeni people since 1981. He also noted the meetings and  dialogue that followed until 22 May 1990, when these efforts  were crowned with the declaration of the establishment of unity  and the establishment of the Republic of Yemen by peaceful and  brotherly means through which the one Yemeni family, which had  been dispersed by colonialism and the imamate, was reunited.  The brother president said: The Yemenis offered the most  cherished sacrifices to regain this unity. The brother  president thanked the sons of the Ta'izz Governorate for hosting  the meeting of the Yemeni ulema, which is being held in the  mosque of revered Prophet Muhammad's companion Ma'adh ibn-Jabal  in the al-Janad area in accordance with the call that was  addressed to me and to the brother vice president to meet in  this historical mosque and in this heroic city to study the  present crisis and find solutions that will save the masses of  our people from the tribulation they suffer as a result of the  economic crisis brought about by the political crisis and the  great impact it has left on the daily life of the citizen.    The brother president said: In these critical circumstances,  I call on every citizen to say what he believes to be right and  to confront what is wrong without fear. He added: We want  every citizen to say to the person who committed a mistake that  he has done so and to the benefactor that he has done right. We  want the citizen to raise his sincere and resonant voice on what  is taking place now, fearing God only.    In his address, the brother president spoke about the causes  of the crisis and its developments. He said: The crisis has  been exacerbated since 19 August last year following the return  of my comrade and colleague 'Ali Salim al-Bid, Yemeni Socialist  Party [YSP] secretary general, from his trip abroad for  treatment. All the masses of our people are aware of this. We  have endured many falsehoods, and suffered great harm, and the  falsification of facts for the sake of the homeland and to  safeguard unity. Everyone knows that the crisis began within  the framework of our partner, the YSP, which later transferred  it into a crisis between the president and his deputy, and then  between the General People's Congress [GPC] and the YSP, and  then between the GPC, the YSP and the Yemeni Reform Grouping.  We must now clarify things and tell all the facts so that all  the people will know who is responsible for the crisis and how  it has been exacerbated. He said that the government under  Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas has not come forth with any  state budget since 1993 and the state is now being run in 1994  without any budget. He explained that some forces and quarters  are working to destroy the state's institutions, particularly  the forces and quarters that stood against unity and seek to  spread disorder, corruption, and sabotage in our society.    The brother president said: We must shun all the  experiences that were tried during the so-called fragmentation  era and evaluate our experience in the economic, administrative,  and development areas by economic, sharia, law, and  administration scientists and experts so that we may choose the  best. We are not biased toward any single experience. What we  want is to build our homeland on sound bases, away from  oneupmanship and empty slogans. He indicated that there are  those who seek to exacerbate the citizens' sufferings through  price hikes to instigate and foment anger and prompt citizens to  engage in riots, sabotage, and plunder, as happened on 9-10  December 1992. He noted that he had accepted all the points the  YSP has raised since the eruption of the crisis, beginning with  the three points regarding the proposed amendments to the  drafting of the articles enshrined in the constitutional  amendment bills pertaining to local government, the Advisory  Council, and the form of presidency, and ending with the 18  points, the acceptance of which was set as a condition for the  attainment of a solution, not to mention its demands for the  enactment of a presidential elections bill, of which a similar  bill has already been passed. The parties to the coalition  government concluded an agreement on the aforementioned  amendments. We have also accepted the decisions and  recommendations made by the masses' gatherings in the provinces,  the last of which were the decisions made by the masses'  gathering of the Ta'izz Province and the initiative of their  eminences the ulema.    The brother president added: We have accepted all this to  spare Yemen any possible dangers. I have come to Ta'izz to  resolve the crisis. In the past, I went several times to Aden  to achieve unity. Why then doesn't the Ta'izz meeting  materialize to preserve and safeguard unity, spare our people  seditions, and relieve them of this immense suffering, which is  caused by the crisis?    The brother president touched on several current issues,  including the issue of local government. He noted that he is  for easing the centralization of authority and the introduction  of administrative decentralization. He added: We have  instructed the government to achieve this objective. We also  asked it to draft new legislation stipulating that local  councils must create their own revenues, which must be used to  implement development and services projects in the provinces.    The brother president called upon the residents of the  Ta'izz  Governorate, and all of our people's masses, to demonstrate  vigilance and awareness so they may be able to confront  misleading propaganda and the misrepresentation of facts being  promoted by some in order to thwart the efforts of those who are  attempting to make our country take steps backward or push it  into the abyss.    The meeting was opened by a recitation of Koranic verses.  Then, Shaykh Muhammad Muhammad 'Abd-al-Malik delivered a speech  on behalf of the province's population. He began by welcoming  the brother president. On behalf of the province's population,  he thanked the brother president for the favorable response he  showed to the ulema's call for a meeting between him and his  brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid at al-Janad Mosque. He hoped that  this initiative will be well received by all in the interest of  Yemen and its stability. He added: Our people's masses are  looking forward to this meeting, which we hope will crown all  efforts with success, so that our people may cope with their  problems and meet the challenges facing their unity. For, this  is a must if they are to achieve progress and prosperity under  unity, the people's fate.    Then, brother 'Ali 'Abdallah al-Dali'i delivered a speech on  behalf of the coordination council of political organizations  and parties. He began by welcoming the visit of the brother  president to the province on this spiritual occasion, which is  dear to our Yemeni people. He explained the political  organizations' positions on the political crisis being  experienced by our country, which is jeopardizing its unity. He  added: The Yemeni masses, who have made dear sacrifices to  promote the Yemeni revolution and achieve unity, will not  hesitate to make additional sacrifices to safeguard unity and  entrench it.    Afterward, an open discussion was held. Several brother  members of the expanded masses' gathering of the Ta'izz Province  took part in this discussion. In this discussion, they affirmed  their concern for safeguarding and defending the unity of the  homeland, and asked that a serious and responsible dialogue be  used as a vehicle for defusing the crisis. They also  underscored the need for the two brothers, the Presidential  Council chairman and the Presidential Council vice chairman, to  meet at the Mu'ad Bin-Jabal Mosque in response to the Yemeni  ulema's appeal to reach solutions that will resolve the crisis  and halt the sufferings and calamities it is causing to citizens.    The meeting was attended by several brother state officials.</p>

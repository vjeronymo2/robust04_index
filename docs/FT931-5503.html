			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Pentos to sell office furniture activities PENTOS, owner of specialist retailers Dillons, Ryman and Athena, has put its office furniture group up for sale as it reported a collapse in 1992 pre-tax profits from Pounds 15.2m to Pounds 4m. The group also revealed that the Pounds 3.7m purchase of Wilding Office Equipment in December 1991, now merged with the Ryman's chain, had resulted in a fair value provision of Pounds 12m. Debt rose from Pounds 20m to Pounds 44m for gearing of 36 per cent. The pre-tax figure, achieved on sales 16 per cent higher at Pounds 236.4m (Pounds 204.3m), was Pounds 1m lower than analysts' expectations, based on a profits warning in December. However, the shares rose 1 1/2 p to 52p when it became apparent the company would not announce a rights issue, as had been rumoured in recent weeks. The profits were hit by exceptional charges of Pounds 3.5m, for redundancy and reorganisation costs largely in the office furniture and Athena cards and posters divisions. On the sale of the office furniture business, Mr Clive Gregory, finance director, said Pentos was prepared to 'sit happily until we can get the right price'. The division was valued in the books at Pounds 23m. Office furniture incurred a Pounds 300,000 loss (Pounds 3.7m profit). However, overheads had been reduced by 20 per cent, and it was on target to contribute about Pounds 2m this year. Athena suffered from a 7 per cent increase in occupancy costs and lower turnover. Like-for-like sales in the UK dropped by 3 per cent, leaving with a Pounds 500,000 loss. The best news came from Dillons, where like-for-like sales were 4 per cent ahead. Some Pounds 11m was spent opening 12 new stores, bringing the total to 117. Mr Gregory said Dillons claimed 12.5 per cent of the UK's Pounds 1.2bn market. The Christmas promotion of books outside the net book agreement had been as successful as last year, with sales up 60 per cent. Ryman was hit by lower demand from its smaller company customers. Nevertheless, it managed a 1 per cent advance on a comparable sales, helped by the integration of the Wilding business. The final dividend is cut from 2.05p to 0.8p, for a total of 1.5p (2.75p). Earnings fell from 9.1p to 2.6p.</p>

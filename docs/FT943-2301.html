			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: The cold war will end only when Russia joins Nato Sir, After reading Judy Dempsey's report, 'Moscow 'cannot join Nato'' (September 10/11), I could not help being worried by the remarks of Mr Volker Ruhe, Germany's minister of defence. If his opinion reflects general feelings in the west then the cold war is not finished. If he speaks like this in Moscow, most of our democrats and liberals will vote to increase military spending and the armed forces (beyond the current 2.1m soldiers). If Russia is 'different' and cannot be integrated then Nato (the EU is a different issue) will be enlarged and reinforced against Russia, which will then never feel secure - and naturally so. Why can we not be integrated? I have heard such bizarre arguments as 'Russia is not European'. Sorry, but look up the past 1,000 years of history and you will see we are more European than the US or Turkey. Yes, we are a big country with lots of problems but if we are incompatible please make clear by what criteria this is so - probably it will help us domestically. But don't let there be arrogance and short-sightedness - particularly from Berlin, which has been forced to host Russian armies three times in not so many centuries. I am absolutely sure that global security will be strengthened only if Russia is integrated into Nato and our generals rub shoulders with their western colleagues. Only then will the cold war come to a real end. Do not forget that we have plenty of war hawks in Moscow and Mr Ruhe seems to be intent on helping them. I think that Nato itself has to be reformed, with US domination, which is no longer needed, scaled down and the widespread fears of a stronger Germany dissipated. Russia's membership will help achieve just that. Finally, Russian democracy is still an ailing infant and sincere integration of Russia into the European and international community can help avoid any turning back - and disaster.

			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report GOLD was again in retreat on the London bullion market as Comex futures came under pressure from selling by locals testing the market's downside support. Dealers said US funds appeared to have largely liquidated their positions, leaving them neutral as a market factor, while other directions were scanned for the possible source of selling that might push gold through support at Dollars 348 a troy ounce. Gold has to hold the Dollars 348 area to retain its recent technical uptrend and was fixed at Dollars 348.60, down 65 cents from the morning fix. Official selling could be the catalyst to push the market down through the pivotal support, dealers said. On the LME COPPER edged further ahead as Chinese buying continued. Three-month metal closed above Dollars 2,510 a tonne, suggesting further gains, dealers said. Three-month TIN put on a spurt in late trading on short covering and closed at Dollars 6,835 a tonne, up Dollars 100. The market is staging a correction from the recent fall to eight-week lows. NICKEL succumbed to downside pressure, with three-month metal retreating below Dollars 7,400 a tonne. The failure to move above Dollars 7,450 and fill a chart gap above that level has dampened sentiment, dealers said.</p>

Aytes, Director, Service Center Operations, Immigration and Naturalization Service, 425 I Street, NW., room 4014, Washington, DC 20536, telephone (202) 514&hyph;3156. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The Immigration and Naturalization Service published a proposed rule on December 2, 1991 at 56 FR 61201 as part of a comprehensive initiative to simplify and streamline the filing and processing of applications and petitions for immigration benefits. This initiative has already led to a number of steps which have begun to significantly improve efficiency and the quality of service provided to the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of comments were received about this proposal. Many were prepared by a working group of interested organizations. The following sections discuss the comments and explain the revisions adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Representation by Another Person  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters opposed the proposed requirement that an applicant or petitioner sing Form G&hyph;28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative, to show that he or she authorized the representation. For example, one commenter argued that an attorney's indication that he or she represents someone should be accepted as ``absolutely definitive evidence'' since submission by an attorney where not so authorized would be a violation of his or her ethical and legal obligations, and would subject him or her to disciplinary action and a malpractice suit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, a number of other commenters within the industry supported the new requirement. Some pointed out that the form is not only used by attorneys. Others noted that requiring the signature can help combat the unauthorized practice of law. Still others felt that the signature would address potential Privacy Act concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons given by those supporting the new requirement, as well a those enumerated in the proposed rule, this proposal has been retained. An applicant or petitioner must sign the Form G&hyph;28 to definitively indicate to the Service that he or she has authorized the person to represent him or her in the proceeding. The person submitting the Form G&hyph;28 must be authorized under 8 CFR part 292 to represent the applicant or petitioner. Where a Form G&hyph;28 is submitted that is not properly signed, the application or petition will be processed as if a Form G&hyph;28 had not been submitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Notification Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Where an applicant or petitioner has an authorized representative, the Service now mails two copies of each written notice. One goes to the applicant or petitioner, and the other goes to the authorized representative. The proposed rule suggested sending only one notice in such a case, and sending it to the representative. This would have meant that the Service would communicate with the applicant or petitioner through his or her authorized representative if he or she had one.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenters pointed to past problems in representatives receiving their copy, and argued that separate notices should be continued as a safeguard. After review, the Service will therefore continue to send separate notices to the applicant or petitioner and his or her authorized representative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

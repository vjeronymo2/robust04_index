			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Names to take case to Lords A group of 500 loss-making Lloyd's Names is to take its case to the House of Lords, Richard Lapper writes. The Court of Appeal ruled at the end of June that the Names, who are all members of the Outhwaite syndicate 317/661 in the 1982 year of account, were too late to start legal action to recover insurance losses, overturning a judgment made last year by the High Court. The Names, individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the insurance market, allege breach of duty by their agents. They did not participate in a successful earlier action by fellow Names on the syndicate which resulted in a Pounds 116m out-of-court settlement in February 1992. Last year Mr Justice Saville ruled that the Names, whose solicitors are Norton Rose, could take action against RHM Outhwaite (Underwriting Agencies), which managed syndicate 317/661, and approximately 80 members' agents. Solicitors Denton Hall are acting for RHM Outhwaite, while Oswald Hickson, Collier are acting for a number of the members' agents in the case.</p>

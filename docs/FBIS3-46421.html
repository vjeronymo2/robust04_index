			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Liu </F> Zhenying (0491 2182 5391) and XINHUA reporter Xu Yaozhong (1776  5069 0022)]    [Text] Beijing, 27 Jan (XINHUA) -- In a speech at a  national work conference on the "vegetable basket," grain,  cotton, and edible oil, State Council Premier Li Peng stressed:  The bounden duty of governments at all levels is to keep in  mind the immediate and vital interests of the broad masses.  Ours is a people's government, and the aim of the people's  government is to serve the people wholeheartedly. He urged that  governments at all levels make caring for the people and  improving their living standards the first and most important  task.    The two-day national work conference, convened by the State  Council, closed in Beijing this afternoon.    Vice Premier Zhu Rongji presided over today's meeting.    Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan, Tianjin Mayor Zhang Lichang,  Shanghai  Mayor Huang Ju, Vice Mayor Jin Mingshi of Shenyang, and Vice  Mayor Zhou Jianzhong of Chongqing spoke at the conference.    After hearing the speeches, Premier Li Peng said: The  current situation of the production and market supply of farm  products as a whole is good. We have reaped good harvests for  several years in a row and have achieved notable results in the  "vegetable basket" project. The total supply of farm produce,  and food in particular, has become relatively abundant in China  as compared with the chronic shortages of the past.    He said: Despite the excellent situation, fluctuations in  the  market prices of grain, oil, and sideline products occurred in  some localities during a period from November last year. The  problem has been caused by various factors, the most important  of which, I believe, is our failure to thoroughly understand the  continued need to exercise macroeconomic regulation and control  over the market under the new situation arising from price  decontrol. The purpose of the current conference is to achieve  unity in thinking and understanding, and to draw on experiences  and lessons for further solving the problem of making the  "vegetable basket," grain, cotton, and edible oil work meet the  requirements of a socialist market economic structure.    Premier Li Peng discussed questions in five aspects: 1)  Caring for the people and improving their living standards is  the first and most important task of governments at all levels;  2) ensuring a sufficient supply of goods and establishing a  larger distribution and circulation pattern; 3) building up and  managing markets well; 4) strictly enforcing macro-economic  regulation and control; and 5) further implementing the mayor's  responsibility system.    Li Peng said: In our historical advance toward becoming a  modern socialist power, we should attach great importance to  both feeding the people and economic construction, and properly  handle the relationship between the two. Feeding the people,  which means caring for and improving their life, is a major task  of governments at all levels. We must bear in mind this major  task in unifying our thinking and understanding, striving to do  a good job in the "vegetable basket," grain, cotton, and edible  oil work and ensuring ample supply and relatively stable prices  in the market. He said: As current incomes of most rural and  urban residents are still relatively low and food expenses are  much higher than for other consumer goods, the prices of staple  foods, including grain, oil, meat, and vegetables, can directly  influence consumption standards. To effectively solve problems  in the production and supply of vegetables, grain, cotton, and  edible oil is a matter of grave importance, which should never  be treated lightly.    Li Peng pointed out: This will be a year in which our  country will take a giant step forward in instituting major  reform measures. The successful implementation of these major  reform measures has a bearing on whether the reform can succeed  and on the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the  national economy. The smooth progress of reform requires that we  maintain social stability and set people's minds at ease. We  must make great efforts to maintain relatively stable commodity  prices in the marketplace, particularly the prices of grain,  edible oil, meat, vegetable, and eggs; and we must make great  efforts to strengthen and develop the current social stability  and unity; and correctly handle the relationship between reform  and development on the one hand and stability on the other.    He said: In deepening reform, we must consider the interests  of the masses of people in all strata, both in urban and rural  areas. Our country's reform is compatible with the fundamental  interests of the broadest masses of people. However, this does  not mean that in the process of reform, every stratum and  individual will receive equal interests and tangible benefits  all at the same time. In light of this, in conducting our work,  we must show particular concern about the masses of people who  are not well-off or even have considerable difficulties in their  daily lives at present. We must adopt effective measures to  earnestly resolve the difficulties encountered by low-income  people in their daily lives. Li Peng said: Thanks to the  efforts of all quarters, the momentum of excessive increases in  the prices of grain, edible oil, and nonstaple food in the  preceding period is now under control, and the prices have come  down to some extent. We must take further steps to ensure that  the high sales prices will continue to drop.    Li Peng pointed out: Developing production and enlivening  circulation are basic conditions for maintaining an abundant  supply of nonstaple food, grain, cotton, and edible oil in the  market and for maintaining the relative stability of their  prices. Developing production constitutes the foundation for  ensuring the supply of nonstaple food, grain, cotton, and edible  oil. We must mobilize the initiative of the peasants to carry  out scientific farming and vigorously develop nonstaple food,  grain, cotton, and edible oil production. He said: On the  basis of a vigorously developed production, we must establish a  big commodity circulation setup and an operating mechanism  promoting overall balance, free flow of goods, and flexible  operation. Governments in all localities must attach importance  to the construction of transportation, storage, preservation,  and other basic circulation facilities to facilitate the  shipment of vegetables from the south to the north, and grain  from the north to the south and from the central regions to the  west. We must truly ensure the free flow of commodities and  closely link production regions with marketing regions.  Governments in all localities must take further steps to remove  all kinds of obstacles to circulation and sternly crack down on  gangsters and thugs in the transportation sector. Large and  medium-sized cities must create conditions to attract  out-of-town vegetable growers to market their produce in the  city by ensuring their safety and fair trade.    Li Peng said: To do a good job in the production and supply  of nonstaple food, grain, and edible oil, it is necessary to pay  attention to market construction and the establishment of a  network which combines agricultural produce markets, which  center on wholesale markets, with retailers. This important  experience was gained by some of the large and medium-sized  cities which achieved results in building "vegetable basket"  projects in recent years.    He said: Under the conditions of decontrolled operations,  governments at all levels must pay particular attention to  market management. Lifting control to enliven operations does  not mean washing our hands of the operations. We must sternly  crack down on illegal elements who manipulate the market,  speculate or jack up prices, produce or sell substandard or fake  merchandise, entrap people or swindle them, or commit other  illegal acts. Industrial, commercial, public security, railway,  and transportation departments must closely coordinate with each  other to take concerted action and ensure a notable improvement  in market order before the Spring Festival and maintain a good  market order indefinitely.    Li Peng said: At present, the following three tasks should  be grasped in the regulation and control of farm products in our  country:    First, it is necessary to establish a reserve system of  grain, oil, cotton, meat, vegetables, and sugar. Both the  central and local authorities should strive to improve  administration over the reserve system.    Second, it is necessary to establish a risk fund system for  grain and sideline products. All subsidies from central and  local authorities for grain, meat, and vegetables should be used  for the establishment of the risk fund system. Moreover, more  capital should be raised from other sources for the purpose of  expanding the system to an appropriate scale.    Third, it is necessary to establish a monitoring system for  the farm products market and improve the farm products  information network. In this way, the government will be to  rely on scientific information provided by them to make  decisions on the implementation of macroeconomic regulation and  control.    Li Peng said: It is been stressed many times that the  "vegetable basket project" should be undertaken by various  localities, especially by the governments of large and medium  cities, through the implementation of a mayoral responsibility  system. Ensuring the people's livelihood needs is the primary  function of mayors and is most important for stabilizing the  overall situation. This should be included as a target for the  personal responsibility system for mayors, and evaluations  should be conducted each year. The results of the evaluation  should be reported to the city people's congress and the city's  people.    He said: How can a mayor successfully carry out the  "vegetable basket" task? The most important thing for a mayor  to do is to ensure a balance between supply and demand in  nonstaple foods. All big and medium cities should be  responsible for maintaining an overall balance between supply  and demand. Under no circumstances should they wait until there  are problems before attempting to achieve a balance between  supply and demand. If that happens, the loss will be colossal.  It is necessary to ensure sufficient land for growing  vegetables and to strictly stop the practice of using vegetable  land for other purposes. Without vegetable farms, there will be  no vegetable baskets. Therefore, we must protect the vegetable  basket with vegetable farms. In some cities vegetable land has  been used for other purposes to an excessive extent, and  vegetable land has not been supplemented sufficiently. This is  one of the important causes that led to a shortage of vegetable  supplies in the relevant localities. This problem must be  solved as soon as possible. Vegetable land that has been used  for other purposes must be quickly supplemented. While  establishing their own nonstaple food producing bases, various  large and medium cities should also, in line with the need,  establish nonstaple food producing and marketing coordination  zones with other cities. It is necessary to gradually form a  vegetable production pattern in which production relies mainly  on suburban areas, supplemented by nearby farming areas, and is  regulated by products from other cities.    Li Peng said: To achieve a balance between supply and  demand, we must ensure funds for the construction of bases for  producing vegetables and other nonstaple foods, funds for price  risks, and funds for the construction of cold storages, the  circulation setup, and other infrastructure facilities.    Li Peng expressed the hope that when participants returned  home, they will conscientiously publicize and implement the  guidelines of this conference and adopt measures, in line with  actual conditions, to make sure their work is done well. He  also hoped that they will, in accordance with the guidelines of  this conference, do a good job in ensuring a stable supply of  grain, oil, and nonstaple foods during the Spring Festival, so  as to enable the people to have a happy and peaceful festival.    Leading comrades of the Central Committee and the State  Council who also attended the conference were Zou Jiahua, Qian  Qichen, Li Lanqing, Li Tieying, Wen Jiabao, Chi Haotian, Song  Jian, Chen Junsheng, Ismail Amat, and Luo Gan.    Vice Premier Zhu Rongji made a speech on the first day of  the  conference. In his speech, he analyzed the current economic  situation and stressed the importance and urgency of doing the  work on vegetables, grain, oil, and cotton well, in order to  guarantee market supply, and maintain social stability and the  overall situation of reform and opening to the outside world.  He also mapped out an overall plan for unifying thinking and  understanding, clearly defining responsibilities, and doing work  on the"vegetable basket," grain, cotton, and oil still better,  and set explicit requirements in connection with this work.</p>

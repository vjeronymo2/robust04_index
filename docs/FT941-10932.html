			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Equity Markets: Swaps dealers upset by threat of legislation  -Risk and reward A prominent US Congressman is proposing a new agency to oversee US derivatives dealing, a move that some swaps dealers fear would inhibit the fast-growing industry. Mr James Leach, the top Republican on the House Banking Committee, has introduced legislation to set up a Federal Derivatives Commission which would establish standards for capital, accounting, disclosure and suitability for institutions dealing in derivatives. The Commission would co-ordinate the fragmented derivatives oversight of six US agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Comptroller of the Currency. The bill has received little support in Washington, but it sets the stage for a battle between some members of Congress and the derivatives industry when the re-authorisation of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission begins later this year. Congress gave the CFTC partial oversight of over-the-counter derivatives in 1992, but promised to revisit the issue this year. Mr Leach's bid for a co-ordinating agency echoes recommendations made in several comprehensive studies of the derivative industry during the past year. The last of these studies, by the General Accounting Office, the independent research arm of Congress, is expected later this month. These studies were sparked by concerns that growing derivatives exposure among financial institutions was fuelling systemic risk, and that potential problems may not be spotted because some derivatives operations were slipping through the regulatory net. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association, the swaps industry body, responded to the Leach proposal with a statement that 'some provisions of the bill may inhibit desirable risk management activity; impose an inequitable scheme of regulation on derivatives dealers and end-users; and roll back some of the protections currently afforded market participants in the event of insolvency'. Nevertheless, the current regulatory structure, based on divisions between banking and securities operations, does appear increasingly archaic. Paribas, the French bank, has introduced an innovative equity-linked structure to the sterling bond market. On Friday, Paribas launched a Pounds 50m offering of five-year bonds for ABB International Finance, an arm of the international electrical engineering company. The bonds are convertible into a cash amount based on the performance of the FT-SE 100 index of UK stocks. Similar deals, linked to the CAC-40 index, have been launched in the French market. The ABB issue is structured to resemble a conventional convertible bond which can be converted into the shares of a single company. But the investor is exposed to the FT-SE index, according to a predetermined formula, instead of an underlying stock. The premium is 20 per cent, and the bonds pay a coupon of 3 per cent and are priced at par. The deal was placed mainly in continental Europe among insurance companies and other financial institutions. Some institutions, which are not allowed to use derivative products but can buy bonds with embedded derivatives, buy such bonds for asset allocation. For ABB, the structure provides cost savings over a conventional financing. However, the disadvantage for the issuer is that the bonds can be exchanged at any time after the first year, so the exact term of the financing is uncertain.</p>

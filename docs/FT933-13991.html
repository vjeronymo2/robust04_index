			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / People: Stalking and poaching in Scotland's banks It is almost unprecedented for Scotland's two leading banks, the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Bank of Scotland, to poach each other's senior executives. But the Royal Bank is increasingly aggressive these days and has now lured Leith Robertson, one of the Bank of Scotland's senior management buyout specialists, to become its corporate director in charge of mbos and acquisition finance. His job at Bank of Scotland was chief manager, corporate banking. Bank of Scotland has been very successful in providing debt for mbos and Royal Bank wants to expand further in this area. The appointment of Robertson, 41, who has spent all his career at the Bank of Scotland, is also another sign of the Royal Bank's tendency under its ceo George Mathewson to fill senior posts from outside its own hierarchy. Robertson will replace and report to Donald Workman (left), who becomes director of commercial banking services. Workman joined the Royal Bank last year from Credit Lyonnais Capital Markets, though until 1991 he was managing director of Castleforth Fund Managers, a venture capital company which was a joint venture between Royal Bank and Credit Lyonnais. Another relative newcomer to the bank is Frank Kirwan (right),who is to be director of retail banking services in the branch banking division. Kirwan joined the bank in 1988 from the Scottish Development Agency to which he was recruited by Mathewson, who was then its ceo. At the Royal, Mathewson made Kirwan director of strategy; he was involved in cementing its alliance with Banco Santander of Spain and, more recently, disposing of the merchant bank Charterhouse.</p>

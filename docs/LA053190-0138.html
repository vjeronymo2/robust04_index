			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> PARKFIELD;  </P> <P> QUAKE EXPECTED WITHIN 2 YEARS  </P> <P> Scientists say the long-awaited Parkfield earthquake should hit Central  California sometime within the next two years, most likely around March, 1991.  Parkfield, which straddles the San Andreas Fault east of San Luis Obispo, has  had moderate quakes about every 22 years, and the area has been heavily  instrumented by scientists who hope to learn much about what happens before,  during and after a temblor.  </P> <P> The last quake hit in 1966. The quakes usually have a magnitude of about 5.5  and do little damage in the rural area. In today's issue of the British journal  Nature, scientists with the University of Colorado, the U.S. Geological Survey  and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report that the  Parkfield area has been seismically quiet for some time now, suggesting that  the fault may be storing its energy in preparation for the large quake.  </P></p>

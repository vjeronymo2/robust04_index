			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Losses in Philippines securities scandal put at Dollars 23m: Central bank has moved to allay public alarm Losses incurred by Philippine financial institutions from investments in government securities placed through a collapsed investment company were officially estimated yesterday at 938m pesos (Pounds 23m). The country's monetary authorities announced the figure to allay fears of severe damage from a scandal surrounding Bancapital Development Corporation, which was little known in Manila's financial community until it closed last month having failed to deliver large amounts of Treasury bills purchased by banks and other financial institutions. The affair became public this week following the death of an executive of Bank of Commerce, a medium-sized commercial bank which is among those which have suffered losses. Bancapital, an unlicensed trader in the secondary market for government securities, had lured investors with an offer of yields of up to 3 percentage points above market rates. A special meeting yesterday of the monetary board, the policy-setting body of Bangko Sentral, the central bank, decided to pursue investigations on possible violations of bank internal controls in the acquisition of Treasury bills. The board said the estimated losses compared with total resources of 1,290bn pesos held by banks and non-banks with quasi-banking functions at the end of 1993. The banking system, the board said, 'is stable and. . . . there is no reason (for the public) to panic'. A wave of deposit withdrawals was reported to have hit Bank of Commerce on Wednesday, forcing it to seek emergency loans of up to 1bn pesos. Yesterday the tension had apparently eased and no other banks reported unusual activity. Officials of Bankers' Association of the Philippines, which groups the domestic private commercial banks, said Bancapital had been buying securities in the secondary market and selling them 'more than once' to other investors. Actual deliveries of the securities were not made and instead 'custodial receipts' were given to investors. Recent fluctuations in money market rates triggered the company's troubles, according to bankers, who were surprised, however, at the investments made by bigger financial institutions in Bancapital. Banks can participate in weekly auctions of Treasury bills conducted by the central bank. The Philippines' trade deficit was Dollars 1.13bn in the first two months of the year, up by 54 per cent over the same period of 1993, according to the central bank. Exports rose 14 per cent to Dollars 1.87bn, and imports were up 26 per cent to Dollars 2.99bn.</p>

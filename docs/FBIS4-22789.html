			<p>Safety   Nets   <F P=102> 944E0724A Moscow KOMMERSANT-DAILY in Russian 9 Apr 94 p 3 </F> <F P=103> 944E0724A </F> <F P=104>  Moscow KOMMERSANT-DAILY </F> <F P=105>  Russian </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Podlipskiy: "Russia's Poor: The </F> Government Will Give to Everyone"]    [Text] The general agreement signed yesterday by the  trade unions, employers, and the government attests to the fact  that the Chernomyrdin cabinet, under the threat of an outburst  of public dissatisfaction, is prepared to turn the system for  minimal protection of the poor into a kind of social shock  absorber, which even the wealthiest countries do not permit  themselves to have.    The signing of this kind of document in countries with a  traditionally strong orientation toward a mechanism for social  protection financed through the budget (the Scandinavian  countries, for example) becomes an event that is more  significant than presentation of the country's budget. Though  foreign documents similar to the Russian General Agreement are  not considered every year, but are sometimes in force for  decades--in Sweden, for example, relationships among employers,  trade unions, and the government are defined by the  (Saltshebaden) Agreement signed in 1938.    The specific nature of the Russian agreement was apparent in  the content. At present, neither entrepreneurs nor the trade  unions have sufficient influence (chiefly on each other), and  for this reason they look upon the government not as an  arbitrator in disputes, but the only force capable of meeting  their demands. Based on the text of the agreement that was  signed, the conclusion may be drawn that the government has  consented to this role, since it essentially made no  counterdemands.    This conclusion is confirmed by unofficial information that  "the social lobby" has practically succeeded in breaking down  Ministry of Finance opposition and in bringing about an increase  in the minimum wage (it is now 14,620 rubles [R]). It is assumed  that the president's edict on increasing the minimum wage by  roughly 1.5 times as much will be issued at the end of April. In  addition, the government has committed itself to provide for the  electoral support of commodity producers, to regulate the prices  for "socially important" commodities at the local level, and to  review the question of reducing the NDS [value-added tax] and  customs duties on individual types of foods imported into  Russia. The government's rejection of an active policy to create  new jobs is much more substantial.    But the situation in which the official number of unemployed  is less than one-third of the true number of unemployed is  maintained by the methods proposed. The government's commitment  to draft special legislation to pay allowances to employees who  have been sent on administrative leave or who do not work for  full days attests to this, in particular. This actually  encourages an increase in "hidden" unemployment. The commitment  to define the maximum levels of unemployment that are socially  acceptable at the local level is a logical continuation of such  a policy. "Extreme measures to prevent mass dismissals" which  have never been made more specific are being undertaken to  achieve these indicators (in the early stages of preparing the  agreement, freezing privatization and implementation of  procedures to improve economic conditions were considered).    However, the government's failure to make clearly formulated  demands of the trade unions may be considered as giving them a  distinctive kind of advance payument--in the hope that the trade  unions will not be too active in initiating a strike movement.  <H8>  * * * </H8> <H5>  Basic Tasks Defined by the General Agreement in the </H5> Area of Employment Assistance    --to develop a combination of additional measures for social  support of employees under conditions in which restorative  procedures are applied    --to develop a coordinated program of actions in the event  of  an emergency situation in the labor market    --to develop a draft law on payment of allowances to  employees who are shifted to an incomplete work day or are sent  on administrative leave  <H8>  Official Forecast of the Unemployment Level by the End </H8> of the Year    --number of persons registered as unemployed: 3 million    --when International Labor Organization methods are used,  the  number of unemployed may reach 6.5 million    --taking "hidden unemployment" into account, the number of  persons who are unoccupied may reach 8 million</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading FEARS that the Bundesbank would announce a tightening in German monetary policy today led to a cautious mood in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. The firm overnight performance on Wall Street led to a confident opening of the September contract on the FT-SE, at 2,525. This, however, proved to be the high of the session, for September soon went into retreat as nerves about the outcome of the Bundesbank meeting took hold. By 11.30am the contract had fallen to 2,496, the low of the day, and was now trading at a discount to fair value, with sentiment further weakened by the poor performance in the gilts and sterling markets. Sporadic buying in the afternoon on the back of a higher opening in New York helped September claw back some of the earlier losses. It finished at 2,502, down 7 from the previous session and just below its fair value premium to cash of about 18. Turnover was a poor 5,299 contracts. In traded options, turnover reached 36,602 contracts, with trading in the FT-SE 100 option particularly busy. It had a total of 15,048 lots dealt, with the July 2,500 calls active. British Steel was the busiest stock option with 1,860 contracts traded.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Critics cause a ripple in the pool: Pressures to reform the pricing policies of England and Wales's electricity market The arcane and complex operation of England and Wales's electricity pool, the wholesale market through which power is traded, is not a subject on which much light is regularly thrown. The complex trading system leaves most observers in the dark. But when Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, publishes a review of prices today, its role and future strategy will be under the spotlight in a bout of public scrutiny. At issue is the future shape of the pool and, potentially, the survival in their present form of National Power and PowerGen, two of the UK's largest companies which help to run it. Prof Littlechild has warned that, if not satisfied with explanations from the two big generators about rises of up to 20 per cent in pool prices this year, he may refer them to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Though a referral is unlikely for some months, today's report is likely to criticise the generators and strengthen Prof Littlechild's belief that reforms to the system are needed. He is not alone in this. Prompted by the lobbying of industrial energy users, which are the main victims of the price rises, the government is considering plans to enable some of them to bypass the pool and buy directly from 'dedicated' generators. This would have significant implications for most domestic electricity consumers who may see prices rise because they would have to pay a larger share of administration costs. Pool managers and the electricity companies have already set up their own review of operations to take the heat out of the debate. They are looking at how the system can be simplified, and whether changes should be made in transmission services and the bidding system which sets prices. Initial findings are expected in the autumn. The focus of attention is the trading system set up when the government privatised the electricity industry three years ago. The pool is run by executives appointed by the electricity companies. It is not a physical stock of electricity. Instead, it is a mechanism for setting electricity prices. After weighing up supply, which is made available at varying prices by generating companies, and demand, it sets the price of electricity for each half-hour period of the next day. Without it, or something like it, there would be too much or too little electricity at any one time. On a practical level, the pool has worked well. Electricity has been dispatched to where it is needed. As Prof Littlechild observes: 'The lights have stayed on.' Ministers note that most small industrial and household customers have benefited from lower prices since introduction of the pool. This is because their electricity needs have been covered by fixed-price 'hedging' contracts between generators and regional electricity companies, set several years ahead. Short-term changes in the pool price do not affect most consumers. But for large users buying directly from the pool, the latest price increases follow the end of a scheme which, until privatisation, provided them with cheap electricity generated from cut-price coal. The effect of the scheme's demise and pool price rises is demonstrated at Imperial Chemical Industries' chlorine plant at Runcorn, Merseyside, where power costs have risen by 70 per cent in the past two years. Plant managers believe they need to fall 40 per cent to bring costs into line with international competitors. Otherwise, they say, the long-term future of the site is in danger. Such large users are particularly irked because the pool increases come when fuel costs are falling as a result of British Coal price cuts. PowerGen and National Power argue that some of the price rise has been beyond their control, resulting from difficulties with the computer software which calculates prices, and disruptions to the grid caused by smaller generating companies being connected to it. National Power agrees that the prices it demands from the pool have risen since April, because contracts fixed at privatisation, which kept pool prices artificially low, ended in March. 'Today's bid prices reflect more realistically the cost of electricity production,' says Mr John Baker, chief executive. The complexity of the pool's operation makes argument against the generators an arduous task. 'It is difficult for an outsider to assess how the bid of a particular plant will affect the pool price,' according to one large electricity buyer. 'The generators, on the other hand, with a wealth of experience of the system, can design bids to achieve their particular aims.' The suggestion is that the generators have used their muscle in the market to push up pool prices. But they deny they abuse the system. While Prof Littlechild's report will help resolve the matter, some large industrial users believe a more effective way of reducing prices would be to persuade ministers to allow them to bypass the pool and buy direct from the generators. With pool-associated costs, including administration, amounting to 20 per cent of the final cost of a typical large user's power bill, the savings could be considerable. Intensive energy users justify their case by saying the costs of running the system are mainly associated with fluctuating demand, for which they blame mainly domestic users. Heavy, continuous process industries, such as pharmaceuticals, tend to want constant amounts of electricity each hour of each day of the year. 'Why should we pay for services, including expensive reserves, which are needed because others have less predictable demand?' asks Dr Richard Wills, an economist at the Major Energy Users' Council, representing large consumers. 'The innocent are paying for the actions of the guilty.' However, Mrs Margaret Thompson, pool chief executive, says that, if bypassing the pool means paying no pool-associated charges, 'then it isn't on. The domestic customer would pay. We can try to charge on a fairer basis but the pool cannot be used to provide subsidies.' She says she hopes the pool's internal review will make bypassing irrelevant. In it, the aims of participants vary, but they appear to agree the system should be made simpler and more transparent. The case for change is summarised by Prof Littlechild: 'The more transparency you have the more effective and competitive a market you have. If participants believe a market is open and simple they are more likely to find it satisfactory.' One way to simplify the market would be to abolish the system whereby generators provide five different prices for each individual generating unit of each power station. 'There ought to be a simpler way,' says Mrs Thompson. 'The engineers say it is important that the information is there. The question is whether the information needs to feed into how the prices are set.' Most intensive energy users are more interested in another proposal being considered by the pool: whether it is prepared to accept 'demand-side bidding' proposals. These would provide payments for electricity users who agree to reduce their consumption when the load on the system is high. Among the advantages of such bidding are greater predictability of demand and a cost reduction. Pool executive members are concerned this would be a back-door method of cutting prices for large users. 'I'm not sure that agreeing not to take electricity, in effect doing nothing, is a service which demands payment,' said one. 'However it might be a more perfect market if demand-side bidding was introduced.' The third area under review by the pool involves transmission services, including whether the National Grid, which runs the electricity system, can be provided with new incentives to cut costs. Under existing arrangements, the grid passes on all the costs of administering the pool to customers. It has suggested a complicated reform, backed by hedging contracts with electricity companies, under which it would increase its exposure to risk but would expect to make a profit from doing so. Interesting though the idea may be, the calculations on which is it based do not have the quality of simplicity. That is the problem for most of the options under consideration by the pool. 'The fact is that people are talking at cross purposes,' says an insider. 'It is highly unlikely that you can introduce new rules and expect simplification at the same time.' Given the complexities and the need for consensus, the pool is likely to take several months to implement any reforms. In the meantime, prices show no signs of falling. Pressure for action by the pool or the government is not likely to ease; nor is speculation about the generators' bidding behaviour and a potential monopolies reference.</p>

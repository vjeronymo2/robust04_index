According to figures presented by him,  there are more than 100,000 drug addicts in Georgia and 200,000  people who are taking narcotic substances; these are principally  young people aged between 16 and 30. Georgia is facing the  serious threat of the development of the drugs business. During  the first quarter of 1994, there were 290 registered cases of  drugs being smuggled into the republic. According to  Menagarishvili, the main suppliers of drugs today are  Azerbaijan, Central Asia, India, Pakistan, and Singapore.  Moreover, so-called South Ossetia has recently become a  dangerous center for the narcotics business. The cultivation,  processing, and sale of raw materials for "impure drugs" has  become the main source of income for many residents there.    According to the deputy prime minister, the solution lies in  the creation of the corresponding legislative base to combat  drugs and the drugs business and also a national bureau for the  struggle against drug addiction and the drugs business attached  to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and rayon police  departments. He believes that it is also essential to  coordinate work in this direction with international services  that are engaged in the fight against drugs.</p>

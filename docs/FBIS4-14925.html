			<p>BFN     [Text] Renewed elections to the Ukrainian parliament were  held in 29 out of 33 electoral districts at the weekend. Latest  counts indicate that the Communists and Socialists have won  eight and two seats respectively with 19 other mandates going to  independent candidates, officials of the district election  commissions told INTERFAX-Ukraine.    However, a fresh election is to be held in the four  remaining  districts where none of the candidates has managed to get 50  percent of the vote needed to qualify.    By now 78 candidates have gained mandates to the new  parliament, 20 of them Communists, four Socialists and two of  the Peasants Party. This brings to 26 the number of left-wing  candidates who have won seats to the country's new legislature  compared with about 15 seats won by members of the nationalist  groups. Other winners claim to be independent.    A new round of voting to the country's 450-seat parliament  will be held in the remaining 368 districts on Saturday and  Sunday.</p>

			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Malawi president taken to hospital in S Africa DR Hastings Kamuzu Banda, Malawi's elderly life-president, has been flown to South Africa for medical treatment, it was learnt last night, prompting opposition parties to prepare to help fill a possible power vacuum. Full details of the president's condition have been withheld from the public. Malawians have been told only that Dr Banda, thought to have suffered a heart attack last Thursday, had been confined to bed. However, Mr John Tembo, a senior minister long tipped as Dr Banda's successor, confirmed in an interview with the Financial Times that the president was in South Africa: 'I do not know what is wrong but I hear he is doing better down there'. President Banda's exact age is not certain, but he is thought to be in his mid-90s. He failed to attend the annual convention of the ruling Malawi Congress Party (MCP), in the capital Lilongwe, yesterday. His opening address, which advocated close working relations with opposition parties in the transition to democracy now under way, was read by a minister. This is the first time in Dr Bandas 29-year presidency that he has been officially acknowledged to be in ill health. Opposition parties, believing a power vacuum is about to arise, are anxious about the consequences Dr Banda's death might have for the democratic process which has gone smoothly since last June, when a decisive majority of Malawians voted in favour of political pluralism and an end to the country's one-party system. A National Consultative Committee, on which opposition representatives hold a majority, has been drawing up a new electoral law and a timetable for elections. It has been expected that their recommendations would be endorsed by the ruling Malawi Congress Party in parliament in October. The two chief opposition groups are Mr Chakufwa Chihana's Alliance for Democracy (Aford), associated with the north of the country, and Mr Bakili Muluzi's United Democratic Front (UDF), associated with the south. Aford officials say they would prefer the Congress Party to appoint an interim president, if necessary, until a general election. The UDF is likely to press for an election earlier than the proposed May 1994 date. Mr Muluzi last night called for 'all the parties to play a role in selecting a caretaker president, if necessary'.</p>

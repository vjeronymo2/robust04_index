			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> LIBERAL GROUP GIVES QUAYLE A ZERO  </P> <P> Americans for Democratic Action, one of the country's oldest liberal political  action groups, released its annual ratings of congressional voting records  today and gave Vice President Dan Quayle a zero rating for his last year in the  Senate.  </P> <P> The ADA gave two senators -- Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) and Claiborne Pell  (D-R.I.) -- perfect scores for their 1988 voting records, while 11 Republican  senators, including Quayle, who represented Indiana in the Senate, received  scores of zero. The ADA, founded by such liberal stalwarts as Eleanor  Roosevelt, Hubert H. Humphrey, Walter P. Reuther, and John Kenneth Galbraith,  has been rating the voting records of members of Congress since 1947.  </P></p>

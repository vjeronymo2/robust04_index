			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Underwriting fees reach record level in first quarter WALL Street's securities houses reaped record underwriting fees in the first quarter of this year, as low US interest rates and buoyant stock markets fuelled a flood of new corporate equity and bond issues. According to preliminary figures released by US research firm Securities Data, between January and end-March disclosed underwriting fees reached an all-time high of Dollars 1.73bn, comfortably eclipsing the previous quarter's record Dollars 1.6bn, and almost three times the total recorded in the same three months of 1991. The securities houses made their money selling a record Dollars 289.9bn of new US and foreign debt and equity via 1,566 deals in the first three months of the year. This shattered the previous record of Dollars 239.6bn in the fourth quarter of 1991, when slightly more deals were done. So great was the demand for Wall Street's underwriting expertise that every one of the top seven securities houses more than doubled their fees of a year ago. Merrill Lynch consolidated its position at the top of the table, earning Dollars 354.1m in the quarter. Goldman, Sachs was second with Dollars 250m, thanks to its strength in equity underwriting, and Morgan Stanley third with Dollars 187m. Overall, the pace of domestic US corporate debt and equity issuance was hectic, with Dollars 71.7bn raised in the quarter by US companies, easily beating the previous record of Dollars 47.4bn in the fourth quarter of 1991. The catalyst for the record-breaking quarter was low US interest rates, which encouraged companies to issue new debt, either for expansion or to restructure existing debt. Buoyant US stock markets also played a part, attracting a rush of equity issues by companies eager to take advantage of rising share prices. More than Dollars 30bn was raised via common stock issues and initial public offerings (IPOs) in the quarter, compared with just Dollars 9.5bn at the same stage of 1991. The rush of IPOs was not just a reflection of strong stock markets. Securities Data noted many IPOs had been from industries 'primed for growth in the 1990s, including biotechnology firms involved in pharmaceutical and Aids research, healthcare corporations and software manufacturers'. One of the most active sectors was the market for high-yield, or junk, bonds. During the quarter, Dollars 6.8bn was raised in 39 issues, a remarkable come-back considering that in the first quarter a year ago not a single new junk issue was brought to the market. Another thriving business was in the issuance of mortgage and asset-backed securities, with a record Dollars 103.2bn in new debt raised. Salomon Brothers did especially well, raising Dollars 13.4bn and climbing five places up the underwriting table to claim the second spot behind Kidder Peabody. Although the first quarter has been a bonanza for Wall Street, most observers doubt the pace of corporate issuance can be maintained for the rest of the year. But, if US stock markets avoid a big setback, and interest rates remain low (the Federal Reserve has hinted that monetary policy may remain unchanged for much of the year), securities houses should see a steady flow of new underwriting business in 1992. The boom in stock market and investor activity lifted the operating profits of the New York Stock Exchange last year to Dollars 57.1m, a four-fold increase on 1990. Net income was Dollars 11.8m after non-recurring expenses, taxes and a one-off charge to earnings because of accounting changes. Three factors were behind the improvement. A record 162 companies joined the list of NYSE-traded stocks last year, helping boost revenues to Dollars 374.5m. Trading volume was also exceptionally heavy, averaging 178.9m shares a day, the second highest in the exchange's 200-year history. A cost-containment programme cut 1991 expenses by 5 per cent to Dollars 317.4m.</p>

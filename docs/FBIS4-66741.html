			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Nasrullah Khan: "What Is Happening?] </F>   [Text] The U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South  Asian Affair Ms. Raphel or rifle [as published, preceding word  in English] has openly told us, "Hey people! Open your ears and  listen to me. The United States considers Kashmir a disputed  region and we have said that the oneness of Kashmir will not be  affected. In other words Kashmir will not be divided." When the  U.S. assistant secretary visited Delhi, she was greeted with  black flags. The fundamentalist Indian Hindus believed that she  was trying to stop the brutalities that the Indian military was  committing on the Muslims in Kashmir. How could Kashmir be  India's integral part if this happened? However, later when Mr.  Rao and some important cabinet members talked with Madam Raphel  or rifle, she openly said that she will stop the terrorists from  terrorist activities in Kashmir to resolve this issue and that  Pakistan will not be allowed to provide help to them. Thus,  Madam Raphel has said these things, and now the deputy secretary  of state is also coming to India, or has arrived there before my  column is published, to make India happier and charm it further.  Some people say that this victory does not belong to the  government of India but to the black flags behind which India,  the Indian government, and Kashmir could not be seen. Also,  showing black flags makes white people's color paler and perhaps  the Indian government had paraded these black flags as part of  its diplomatic effort. Madam Raphel had to say that the freedom  fighters are also violating human rights. In other words, it is  not the Indian army alone that is violating human rights.  Justice demanded that Madam Raphel should say that India should  recall its military from Kashmir. What right did the Indian  military have to be in Kashmir after the United States declared  it a disputed region? Will the Kashmiri freedom fighters squash  their heads by hitting them on the wall if the Indian army  leaves? Madam Raphel said in an interview with Doordarshan that  Kashmir cannot be considered an integral part of India forever.  However, showing her black flags was like showing a red flag to  a bull in a bullfight. The United States was like a bull in the  past and the former Soviet Union was like a red flag. Madam  Raphel also said that she had made it clear to Pakistan that the  United States will be unhappy with its providing assistance to  the "separatists" or the freedom fighters. Pakistan really  stopped giving help to the Kashmiri freedom fighters. It means  that if any aid is to be given, it must be given to the Indian  military, and the United States will provide it if needed. It  does not want to make India, which is a large country, unhappy  at all. Later, it will want Pakistan also to become an integral  part of India. Mr. Qazi of Jamaat-i-Islami and other religious  parties know that jihad should be called on Kashmir. By this  jihad they mean to provide economic aid to Kashmiri freedom  fighters. They have collected 20 million rupees for this  purpose. Do they think that they will ask their elected  government to give this money? Since the United States has its  word that it will stop giving assistance to the freedom fighters  in Kashmir, will these parties provide this assistance to  Kashmiris on their own? They cannot make their elected  government do what they want and are not able to send these  money on their own. Therefore, our advise is to start a jihad in  Kashmir and the United States! Perhaps, the United States will  help them in this jihad. The situation in Kashmir now is such  and that United States is supporting India so much that it is  proper for Madam [Bhutto] and her cabinet members to say that  this situation is not the kind that we can let the United States  or India lead us by our noses. Therefore, the government should  take the opposition in confidence at this critical point and  make a decision so that India and the United States cannot  interfere in Pakistan's autonomy. If the Kashmir issue is not  resolved according to the wishes of Kashmiri people, the United  States and India will succeed in making Pakistan an integral  part of India or dividing it up in several parts. This is the  time to be brave and courageous and to tell the United States  bluntly that we have had agreements with you in the past and  have suffered your friendship. You were involved in dividing  Pakistan into two countries also. We are not going to take  "dictation" from some major power because Pakistan is an  independent nation. Therefore, if you think that we will present  Kashmir to India in a silver platter because we are afraid of  you, then it is your vain imagination. If you continue to insist  on our obeying your order, we have to say, "Cat, we mice are  better off without your help."</p>

			<p>Heroin   From Pakistan   <F P=102> 94WD0277B Stockholm SVENSKA DAGBLADET in Swedish 1 Mar 94 p 8 </F> <F P=103> 94WD0277B </F> <F P=104>  Stockholm SVENSKA DAGBLADET </F> <F P=105>  Swedish </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Claes von Hofsten: "Police Fear Drug Wave"] </F>   [Text] Police in Stockholm fear a new wave of African  "swallowers," i.e., people who smuggle heroin-filled condoms in  their stomachs. Five drug smugglers of this kind have been  arrested so far this year.  <H5>  Half a Kilogram of Heroin </H5>   The latest arrived in Stockholm by ferry via Russia and  Finland. The Finnish police thought they knew what was going on,  but instead of arresting the Tanzanian, they shadowed him on the  trip to Sweden. When he reached Stockholm the Swedish police  took over.    The suspect took a taxi to a residential address in southern  Stockholm where a fellow countryman was waiting. At that point  the police moved in. It eventually turned out that the suspect  was indeed smuggling heroin. He was carrying about half a kg in  his stomach.  <H5>  Traffic Gains New Momentum </H5>   Superintendent Lars-Erik Karlsson, chief of the narcotics  division in Stockholm, revealed that this African smuggling  activity started two summers ago. Since then around 40 couriers  have been caught when they came to the Nordic region. Last year  the traffic seemed to die down somewhat, but after the arrest of  five people in the first two months of this year alone, Karlsson  fears that a new wave is on the way.    The smuggling routes have varied. Some have come by plane,  others by boat. Karlsson is convinced that the smuggling is  organized. A common feature is that the drugs involved are brown  smokable heroin from Pakistan. Some of the couriers were loaded  up, as Karlsson puts it, in Africa while others swallowed their  smuggled cargo in Istanbul, Turkey.  <H5>  Two Already Sentenced </H5>   Two of the five people who have been arrested so far this  year have already been sentenced. One, who smuggled in 587  grams, was sentenced to five years in jail plus lifetime  expulsion. The other, who was carrying a record 667 grams,  received a sentence of 5.5 years plus lifetime expulsion.</p>

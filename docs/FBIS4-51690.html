			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- The group governing  agricultural cooperatives said Tuesday [26 April] it has drafted  a proposal for agriculture reconstruction, centering on a review  of the controversial Food Control Law.    The Central Union of Agricultural Cooperatives (Zenchu) said  the proposal also calls on the government to increase stockpiles  of rice, including imported rice, to about two million tons.    The union also urged the government to review its policy of  rice production cutbacks under which farmers are imposed a  uniform quota for acreage reduction.    The proposal is in line with the government policy of  deregulation to cope with a partial opening of Japan's rice  market, union officials said.    The officials said the union wants the government to adopt a  pricing system aimed at promoting consumption of domestically  produced rice.    Rice held in government stock should be used not only for  table use but also for animal feeds and foreign aid, the  officials said.    They said the government should seek the people's  understanding for an extra cost of about 219.3 billion yen for  the rice stockpiles.    The proposal will be examined further before it is submitted  to the government on June 8, when the union will come up with  its demand for prices of newly reaped rice this year, they said.</p>

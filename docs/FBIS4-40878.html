			<p>BFN     [Text] The Helsinki accords, to which advocates of the  inviolability of administrative borders refer, have no force for  post-Soviet states in the territory of the former USSR because  at the time when the accords were signed these countries were  not subjects of international law. This statement was made in  an interview with INTERFAX by the President of the Belarussian  [Belarusian] Academy of Geopolitics Professor Valentin Akulov.    In addition, in his opinion, the West violated the Helsinki  principles when it recognized new republics formed in  ex-Yugoslavia. Thus, a key argument of opponents to changes in  borders does not stand up to criticism cannot be seen as an  obstacle to a Confederation of the Peoples of Belarus, Russia,  and Ukraine.    In the opinion of the professor, the idea put forward in  Moscow a few days ago by public groups from Russia, Belarus, and  Ukraine can be put into practice already this year through  referendums in the three countries. Supporters of a  confederation speak for joint armed forces and a common ruble  space but separate parliaments.    The leader of the Russian Consolidation Party (one of the  advocates of a confederation) Aleksandr Tikhonov is expected to  raise the matter during his Tuesday meeting with the speaker of  the Russian State Duma Ivan Rybkin.</p>

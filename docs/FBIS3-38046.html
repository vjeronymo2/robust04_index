			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Aleksandr Krylovich </F> and Vladimir Taranov]    [Text] Moscow, 24 Feb--"All efforts must now be directed  toward ensuring that the incident over the arrest of a CIA  employee is settled without inflicting any significant political  and diplomatic damage either to Russia or the United States".  This was stated at a briefing today by Grigoriy Karasin,  director of the Information and Press Department of the Russian  Federation Foreign Ministry.    "The position of the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry in  this question is pretty clear," he stressed. According to the  Russian diplomat, the Foreign Ministry had been informed about  the story regarding the arrest of a CIA member and his wife  through official channels in Washington and Moscow. This whole  story raises a great many serious questions that must be  carefully and closely studied and analyzed. Clearly, it is the  professionals--representatives of the special services of both  states--who will play the leading role in this, Karasin noted.    Speaking about the political aspects of the incident, the  Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed that here "it is important  to avoid overdramatization and extreme political emotions". The  Russian side intends to clear up this incident quickly and  effectively, Karasin noted in conclusion.</p>

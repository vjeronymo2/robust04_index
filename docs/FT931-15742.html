			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / The unstoppable Europe Despite the grandiose trumpetings of the glorious achievement of the single market, this does not really seem a very cheerful new year for Europe. The European Community's programme for monetary union is being swept on to the rocks by speculative forces; the continent is gripped in a seemingly interminable recession which in some cases may yet be deepening; many of its governments are in trouble, and most of them deserve to be; and then there is the barbaric war in Yugoslavia. If the Maastricht treaty seemed a year ago to offer a bold and ambitious vision of the future, the excitement it generated seems now to have been destroyed by the onslaught of reality. The mood of Euro-pessimism is not shared by Mr Lester Thurow, one of America's leading celebrity economists. Mr Thurow is not merely convinced that European integration is unstoppable, and will lead inevitably to monetary union by the end of this decade; he also expects that Europe will be the world's dominant economic force in the 21st century. Behind these predictions, set out in his latest book*, there is one fundamental assumption. The world will comprise three economic blocs based on managed trade, centred on Europe, America and Japan, rather than a completely open global economy. These three blocs will be pitted against each other in a strategic economic struggle in which Europe is likely to come out on top. Perhaps Mr Thurow extrapolates too fast: he implies the Uruguay round is bound to fail, and that therefore Gatt is dead. Yet even if this actual negotiation succeeds, it is difficult to believe western industrialised countries can indefinitely accept the political consequences of a totally free global market, either for their domestic wage levels or for their social security systems. The key to victory in the coming three-way economic struggle, according to Mr Thurow, will be the ability to adapt to the new challenges. Here is the unexpected twist in his analysis. Japan and America both have enormous strategic strengths, but both of them will have difficulty in adapting. Europe will have the best chance of coming out on top, he thinks, because it will not be able to avoid making the necessary changes. America must reduce consumption and the deficit and increase investment; it must reform its abysmal school system; and it must downgrade financial short-termism and upgrade concern for human resources. Japan must convert from export-led growth to domestic-led growth (because the rest of the world will compel it) and accept all the consequences of a regional market in the Pacific, including freedom of movement and investment. The European Community has two imperatives: it must go to the end of the logic of economic integration; and it must embrace the emerging market economies of eastern Europe. Each of these challenges will be very difficult to meet. The key difference, in Mr Thurow's analysis, is that Europe cannot avoid doing what is required. 'In the end the Europeans will do what is necessary to complete the integration of the countries now in the Common Market . . . not because they are wise and far-sighted, but because they have no choice . . . History and human nature tell us that it will be far easier for the Americans and the Japanese to avoid doing what they must do if they are to win.' It is easy to predict that America will procrastinate before its hard choices, because that is what America has been doing for several decades. Japan, on the other hand, has proved remarkably dynamic and adaptable, and may continue so. Where Mr Thurow is most provocative is in his assumption that the European Community must pursue the right strategy, of integration and enlargement, because it has no alternative. A Euro-pessimist might feel events were pointing in the opposite direction. The Maastricht treaty has been voided of much of its significance, the plan for monetary union looks in ruins, and the existing exchange rate mechanism is in danger of being destroyed by the markets. Negotiations to admit new members from Efta will start soon, but the benefits of a larger market could easily be offset by decision-making paralysis. A Euro-optimist could make a different analysis. The storms that have been battering the European Monetary System are essentially salutary, because the system in its present half-way house is inherently unstable, and the financial and political stress thrown up by market pressures merely prove the need to strengthen it. If the ERM does fall apart, the member states could revert to flotation. But the case for eventual European monetary union (Emu), as a component part of the single market, remains as strong as ever. Strengthening the system so as to make it less vulnerable will not be easy; but it is likely to be less unattractive to the core states than free floating or exchange controls. Even if Emu were put on a back burner, that would not invalidate the much broader array of convergent interests that have driven the European movement for the past 40 years. Each phase of integration will be politically more stressful than the last. But since it is virtually impossible to imagine the core states wanting to put the process into reverse, one must suppose they will gradually solve the difficulties of going forward. On one point Mr Thurow must be right: the Europeans may go forward; or they may go backward; what they cannot do is avoid making choices. *Head to Head: the Coming Economic Battle Among Japan, Europe and America by Lester Thurow.

			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / International Company News: Bank Leu profits recover BANK Leu, whose profits were virtually eliminated in 1990 by a massive fraud, bounced back last year, achieving a net profit of SFr33.1m (Dollars 23.4m) writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. Leu, which was taken over by CS Holding, the parent of Credit Suisse, in 1990, said net interest earned rose by SFr43.9m to SFr104.7m. Net commissions were virtually unchanged at SFr65.9m as were earnings of SFr27.3m from foreign exchange and precious metals dealing. Total assets dropped 5.1 per cent to SFr12.9bn, as the bank continued to reduce its interbank business.</p>

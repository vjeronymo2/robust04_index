			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / The Guinness Appeals: Allegation against Saunders was 'devastating' A 'DEVASTATING' new and highly prejudicial allegation had been made against Mr Ernest Saunders, the former chairman and chief executive of Guinness, on Day 75 of the Guinness trial last summer, the Court of Appeal was told yesterday. The prosecution had suggested that Mr Saunders had intended for himself Pounds 3m of a Pounds 5.2m payment he had authorised Guinness to make to Mr Tom Ward, a US lawyer and Guinness non-executive director, for his services during the company's Pounds 2.7bn takeover bid for Distillers. Mr Anthony Shaw, for Mr Saunders, said the allegation, which was denied by Mr Saunders, had been devastating - as had been demonstrated by the following day's headlines such as 'Saunders intended to steal Pounds 3m for his own use'. The allegation and the way it had been dealt with by the judge were material irregularities in the trial, Mr Shaw claimed. Mr Saunders is serving a five-year jail sentence for theft, conspiracy and false accounting. He, Mr Anthony Parnes, a City stockbroker serving 2 1/2 years, and Mr Gerald Ronson, Heron group chairman, who was freed in February after serving just under half his 12-month jail sentence, are appealing against their convictions and sentences, which in Mr Ronson's case included a Pounds 5m fine. Mr Shaw said the Pounds 3m had not been mentioned in the indictment or the statement of the prosecution's case, which had been that the Pounds 5.2m had been stolen by Mr Saunders for Mr Ward's benefit. The basis of the new allegation was that the Pounds 3m had passed through Mr Saunders' Swiss bank account. The prosecution had suggested he had had second thoughts about keeping it and transferred it to a Swiss account opened by Mr Ward. The matter had only been raised during cross-examination of Mr Saunders as to credit - questioning designed to test his reliability as a witness and not directed to a specific charge, Mr Shaw said. The defence had objected that if it was alleged that the Pounds 3m was Mr Saunders' reward for his part in illegal activities during the bid it should have been part of the prosecution's primary case against him. Appalling though the prospect of a retrial had been, the judge had been asked to discharge the jury because such an allegation at that stage had been prejudicial and unfair. Mr Justice Henry had refused to do so but had ruled that the matter could only affect Mr Saunders' credit. The hard reality, Mr Shaw said, had been that the jury had been left to think that here was a man charged with theft who had made Pounds 3m out of it. Miss Clare Montgomery, for Mr Parnes, challenged the prosecution's claim, and the judge's ruling, that under the City code on takeovers and mergers, Mr Parnes should have disclosed arrangements with which he had been concerned for payment of indemnities to supporters of Guiness's share price during the bid. The appeals continue today.</p>

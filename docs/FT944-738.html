			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Russian army split over conflict in Chechnya The Russian army's leadership is in turmoil over the bitterly fought campaign in Chechnya, raising the possibility of growing political intervention by senior officers opposed to the use of arms to resolve the conflict. The state Duma (lower house) voted by 228 to 38 yesterday for an appeal to President Boris Yeltsin to break off military action in favour of peace talks. However, Russian forces continued to pound Grozny, the Chechen capital, with bombs and artillery rounds. The city is under constant air bombardment and large parts of the centre have been destroyed. Mr Valery Borshchev, a liberal member of the Duma, said at least 80 people had been killed yesterday and 56 wounded. Russian official sources estimate that 44 Russian troops have died since the action started nearly two weeks ago. Britain and France voiced concern over the conflict. 'We are concerned and have impressed on (the Russians) the need for a solution to be arranged as soon as possible which prevents further bloodshed,' the British Foreign Office said. In an interview to be published today in the daily Sevodnya, Colonel General Eduard Vorobyev, deputy commander of Russian land forces, says: 'We have to save Russia by getting out of the situation which has been created in the country, in Chechnya and in the armed forces.' Gen Vorobyev has tried to resign from his command in protest at the handling of the Chechnya crisis. He says the army involvement was hasty and 'the whole principle is wrong'. Gen Vorobyev says he was offered the command of the Chechen conflict by General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, on Wednesday but refused and instead wrote a letter of resignation. The Post Factum news agency reported last night that his resignation had been refused by his immediate superior, Colonel General Vladimir Semyonov, commander of Russian land forces. Adding to tensions, Lieutenant-General Alexander Lebed, commander of the 14th Army in the Transdnestr area of Moldova, told the RIA-Novosti news agency that he would accept command of the Chechen operation, if offered, but only to get the troops out of Chechnya. 'From the military point of view, the Russian army should never have entered Chechnya,' he said. Gen Lebed, whom a recent poll showed to be the most popular commander among his military peers, has criticised the operation before. But his intervention might aggravate what is now a highly charged situation. The Ministry of Defence is still denying a RIA-Novosti report on Thursday that six senior commanders had been dismissed - although unofficial sources say they have offered resignations, which have been refused.

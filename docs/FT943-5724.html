			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Arts: Art among the ruins - The Obala group from Sarajevo This has been a good festival for the Demarco European Art Foundation, housed for the moment in the former St Marys School. The building is overflowing with activity in every corner. So far, one show, Mirjam by Mariela Stefanski, has won a Fringe First award, Damien Hirst's rats have grabbed lots of welcome headlines, and Romeo and Juliet by the Estonian Youth Theatre is proving a festival favourite. But perhaps the most notable achievement is the appearance of the group of artists from the Obala Gallery in Sarajevo which has finally managed to bring its exhibition Witnesses of Existence to the festival. Invited by Richard Demarco last year, the group was unable to get permits to leave the city. This year, with the help of a sympathetic officer, the artists have been able to get out on UN flights and have taken the show to New York and Switzerland before arriving in Edinburgh. Demarco's interest in eastern Europe is no new phenomenon. The idea for the present show was born when Demarco took a group of Scottish artists to Sarajevo in February 1988. He says, 'I believe we must listen to all the languages of Europe . . . Here we bridge the gap between the world of art and the world of reality . . . around the heart of Europe which is bleeding. Our life as artists is about confronting the issue of the creation of gaps, failing to make contact.' The visiting Sarajevan artists agree with this sentiment, but their position is difficult. After discussion, it was agreed that it would be in everyone's best interests if two Serbian theatre companies originally scheduled to appear at the Foundation staged their performances elsewhere, and a new venue was found. 'Being anti-war is not enough,' the exhibition co-ordinator Izeta Gradevic told me. 'You have to be against the camps, ethnic cleansing, everything. Our group is completely mixed, we are a Bosnian group. But art is not divided from politics.' Demarco believes that education is the vital factor in making art the force for good in our lives, and hopes that the Foundation can remain permanently at the school as a sort of international interdisciplinary university. 'Most people are so simple, their lives are about absurdities, and that is our problem - it is a question of education, of giving people more than they have been given. When we understand that culture and education are two sides of the same coin, we will not have a Ministry of Culture and a Ministry of Education, we will have civilisation.' The experience of the Obala Gallery artists would seem to confirm that art can have a life enhancing role no matter how atrocious the circumstances of its creation. When what was to have been their new gallery space was destroyed by shelling before they had moved into it in spring 1992, they decided to exhibit their work there anyway, and organised a group show in December in the ruins of the basement. Meanwhile, the basement had become a safe passage for pedestrians across an intersection notorious for sniper fire. The artists' diary of the exhibition has photographs showing passers-by, one still in a crouching run, one clutching a loaded shopping bag, staring in amazement at them calmly arrranging their work. 'The artists wanted to keep it as a space for spirituality . . .' Izeta Gradevic explained, and their installations among the ruins, some of which have now been brought to Edinburgh, became an affirmation of the determination to be civilised, to behave above all with decency and dignity, which was coming under such brutal attack. 'People were surprised and happy, they were crying at the opening. When you have no food, no water, no electricity, people used to say is art so important? Now they do not ask that question.' Witnesses of Existence comes to the Atlantis Gallery, London, in December.</p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / FT Guide to Personal Equity Plans - Charges (2): Take care if you pay little tax - Many people have been happy to invest without questioning whether they are getting value for money - but extra admininstration must usually be paid for The worth of a personal equity plan lies in being able to shelter capital gains and income from tax. Attracted by the tax-free label, many people have been happy to invest without questioning whether they are actually getting value for money. You can only invest in a Pep through a plan manager, who will levy charges for the additional administration involved. The main charges are the initial one and an annual management fee. On a unit trust, these charges are typically 5-6 per cent initially and 1.5 per cent annually. Since the dividend yield on the FT-SE A All-Share is only about 3.3 per cent at the moment, the income from the full Pounds 6,000 invested in a total return unit trust Pep would be Pounds 198 in the first year. The tax saving to a higher rate taxpayer would be Pounds 79.20 and Pounds 39.60 to someone in the lower-rate band. Against this saving have to be set the Pounds 330 initial charge (assuming this is 5.5 per cent) in addition to a Pounds 90 annual fee. It will therefore take many years before the income tax saving outweighs the Pounds 420 charge (which excludes VAT), particularly for a lower-rate taxpayer. James Higgins, of fee-based advisers Chamberlain de Broe, says: 'The point of effecting a Pep is to save tax - if the charges are more than the tax saved, then the vehicle is literally a waste of money and for most basic-rate taxpayers, the average unit trust package is just that.' Gains made within a Pep are also free of tax, but capital gains tax is one which few people pay: the Inland Revenue estimates the number for 1993-94 at only 125,000. This tax benefit will be greatest to those who invest their whole Pep limit of Pounds 6,000 a tax year in a general Pep (and a further Pounds 3,000 in a single company Pep) and who hold on to it for as long as possible. They are then likely to make enough capital gain to use up their annual allowance, currently of Pounds 5,800. Deciding to invest in a Pep on the basis of tax savings, therefore, can be a mistake particularly if you are a lower-rate taxpayer. The situation is different, however, if you had anyway decided to enter the stock market, particularly if you intended to do so through a unit trust. This is because. . . UNIT TRUST CHARGES: Most unit trusts do not levy an additional charge for their Pep, so you might as well make use of the Pep facility if your chosen fund has one attached to it. Moreover, many unit trusts companies are competing keenly for Pep business, leading them to bring in lower charges, a process which began in February 1992 when Murray Johnstone reduced the initial charge on all its unit trusts to 1 per cent, and to 1.5 per cent for its Peps. Last October, the Pep charge was brought in line with the unit trusts. However, Murray Johnstone at the same time raised its annual management fee from 1 per cent to 1.5 per cent. Fidelity brought in an American-style innovation when it reduced the initial charge on all its unit trust Peps to 2 per cent in 1992 but introduced withdrawal charges instead. Gartmore, Guinness Flight, M&amp;G and Scottish Equitable have also introduced a similar charging structure. Since equities are a long-term investment, back-end charges are a better idea than initial charges. Investors who hold on to the Pep for long enough, escape the charge altogether. However, all those levying withdrawal charges, with the exception of Gartmore, do so on the value of the fund, which means that you would have to pay the charge on any growth your investment had made. Gartmore levies the exit charge on the initial investment only. Scottish Equitable is the only one of those listed to impose a flat fee of Pounds 45 plus VAT, instead of an initial charge, and this fee is being waived altogether until April 29. Its annual management charge, however, is higher than those imposed by the others listed. A good fund manager can compensate for the initial charge through performance, but in the long run a high annual charge can be more detrimental to an investor's returns. However, the company gives investors a 1 per cent loyalty bonus on the value held in their Pep on its eighth anniversary. There are, in addition, many unit trust companies offering one-off discounts on their Peps in the run-up to the end of the tax year. Save &amp; Prosper, for example, is knocking one percentage point off the unit price of its Peps until April 5, while Prolific is reducing the initial charge from 5.25 per cent to 3 per cent until June 1, in the hope of picking up Pep investments across two tax years. INVESTMENT TRUST CHARGES: Unlike unit trusts, investment trusts tend to impose an additional charge for Peps, because plans do cost money to administer, and normal trust fees are low compared with unit trusts. As a result, lower-rate taxpayers need to consider whether they might be better off investing in an investment trust through a conventional savings scheme rather than the Pep. Price-cutting has also been rife among investment trusts. Finsbury Asset Management which used to charge 2 per cent initially and 0.5 per cent every six months, waived these charges at the beginning of the year. There are no dealing charges either, although there is a transfer charge of Pounds 30. Anthony Townsend, director, said that the cost of operating the Pep scheme could be absorbed by the trust; and, because of the increased demand for the trust, the trust's value also increases. The table shows a selection of investment trust Peps with lower charges. Investors should be wary of trusts with low initial charges but high annual or dealing charges. The Alliance Trust, which has no initial or annual charges, is non-qualifying, so only Pounds 1,500 of its shares can be put into the Pep. However, it allows top-ups at no extra charge from a large number of other investment trusts and UK equities. Finally, investors should never base their Pep choice solely on the charges; performance is far more important in the long run; but if two funds both have good performance, the one with the lower charges will give the investor greater returns.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------              Unit trust Peps with reduced charges  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Company            No of      Initial      Annual      Exit                    funds      charge        fee       charge  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Fidelity            12          2%        Between     3% 1 yr                                           1-1.5%      2% 2 yr                                                       1% 3 yr  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Gartmore             5          2%         1.5%       3% 1 yr*                                                       2% 2 yr*                                                       1% 3 yr*  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Guinness Flight      6          2%        1.5% and    3% 1 yr                                            1.25%      2% 2 yr                                                       1% 3 yr  --------------------------------------------------------------------- M&amp;G                  1          0          1.5%     4.5% 1 yr                                                     4.0% 2 yr                                                     3.0% 3 yr                                                     2.0% 4 yr                                                     1.0% 5 yr  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Murray Johnstone     5          0??        1.5%         0 Scottish Equitable   7          0         1.875%    4.0% 1 yr                                                     4.0% 2 yr                                                     3.5% 3 yr                                                     2.5% 4 yr                                                     1.5% 5 yr  --------------------------------------------------------------------- * Based on initial investment and not on value of units on encashment.  ??

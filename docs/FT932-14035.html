			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Law firm set up with links to accountant A NEW law firm with close connections to Arthur Andersen, the international accountancy network, is to start operations this summer. The link between Garrett &amp; Co and Andersen could pave the way towards the creation of the first multi-disciplinary partnership between lawyers and accountants if professional rules - which are under review  - are relaxed. Mr Colin Garrett, managing partner, said he was sending job offers this week to four or five senior lawyers and expected to start taking on clients in two or three months' time. Two of the professionals would be partners and the remainder senior associates. Three would specialise in commercial law, one in property and possibly another in employment. Advertisements placed in February said each post would pay up to Pounds 120,000. Garrett &amp; Co is independent of Andersen but based in its offices in London, and expects much of its work to come through Andersen referrals. Andersen has already established a number of associations with law firms in other EC countries, including SG Archibald in France and Friehalter, Kruger &amp; Co in Germany. The 1990 Courts and Legal Services Act removed a statutory ban on mixed practices but left professional bodies free to make their own rules, subject to scrutiny by the Office of Fair Trading. A proposed European Commission regulation that would establish a new form of association for the professions has brought the issue back to the top of the agenda. Law Society rules prevent solicitors from entering into multi-disciplinary partnerships with other professionals, but it is consulting on relaxing the rules. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales allows mixed partnerships if 75 per cent of the partners are accountants. The Law Society is thought to favour a similar condition for solicitors.</p>

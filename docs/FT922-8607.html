			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Arts: A Mass of Life - Brighton Festival The Brabant Symphony Orchestra from the Netherlands makes a return visit to the Festival with three concerts based, surprisingly, on the theme of Nietzche's prose poem Thus spake Zarathustra. The first, on Saturday evening, brought the Delius Mass of Life which uses several parts of the poem. This was a 'Europe Day concert'. By now there will have been a second programme including the Strauss tone-poem Also sprach Zarathustra; on Wednesday comes Mahler's Third Symphony of which the fourth movement sets some famous lines from Zarathustra. The visiting orchestra and the Brighton Festival Chorus had a guest conductor, Richard Armstrong. He gave a reading remarkable for clarity and propulsion. The feeling, not unknown in less assured performances, that 'aged Midday' is falling sleep and that his brother 'aged Midnight' has been in that state for some time, was successfully avoided. The attack in the opening number and other double-chorus outbursts, was tonic, the scoring that looks recklessly clotted and extravagant on paper sounded almost lean - all the same, the suspicion remains that in this at the time (1905) fashionably fat and maximalist score there is a thinner one struggling to get out. The point is worth mentioning, because the apparatus involved (large choir, huge orchestra) limits the number of performances of a splendid work many would like to hear more often. Except in one respect the Brabanters are evidently at home with Delius. The horns in 'On the mountains' at the beginning of part two were absolutely secure but they phrased stiffly - the Dutch have cows but not echoing Norwegian valleys - while the typical woodwind arabesques that should soften the outlines of some basic rhythmic patterns, though firmly outlined, were not ideally supple. There was plenty of light and shade: soft choral tone and soft strings were equally beautiful. Much of the going in The Mass of Life has to be made by the four soloists. The baritone alone almost carries the long second half. Here there was some disappointment. David Wilson-Johnson, a most musicianly and intelligent singer, was too restrained and self-communing in his meditations and exhortations (Benjamin Luxon in the EMI/Groves recording is exemplary). The tenor's part is small by comparison, but it needs firmer projection than Justin Lavender gave it. Teresa Cahill made sweet sounds in an unknown tongue. Nietzsche is not for murmuring. The best German came from Yvonne Minton, whom it was a pleasure to hear again - a pity that Delius gave his contralto so little to do. Text and translation, in vilely small print, were included in the programme. Sponsored by The Delius Trust, East Sussex County Council and BAA Gatwick</p>

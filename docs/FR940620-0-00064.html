The emission inventories were submitted by the State of Indiana to satisfy a Federal requirement that States containing ozone nonattainment areas submit inventories of actual ozone precursor emissions in accordance with USEPA guidance. The ozone nonattainment areas covered by the emission inventories addressed in this rulemaking are: Evansville (Vanderburgh County); Indianapolis (Marion County); Louisville (Clark and Floyd Counties); and South Bend/Elkhart (Elkhart and St. Joseph Counties). (The emission inventories for Lake and Porter Counties, the only other ozone nonattainment areas, will be addressed in a separate rulemaking action.) In the proposed rules section of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> , USEPA is proposing approval of and soliciting public comment on this requested SIP revision. If adverse comments are received on this direct final rule, USEPA will withdraw this final rule and address the comments received in response to this final rule in a final rule on the related proposed rule which is being published in the proposed rules section of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This final rule will be effective August 19, 1994 unless notice is received by July 20, 1994 that someone wishes to submit adverse comments.

Emission Inventory Policy and Guidelines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Under the Clean Air Act (Act), as amended in 1990, States have the responsibility to inventory emissions contributing to the violation of a National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), to track these emissions over time, and to ensure that control strategies are being implemented that reduce emissions and move areas towards attainment of the NAAQS. States containing ozone nonattainment areas are required, under section 182(a)(1) of the Act, to submit by November 15, 1992, a comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of actual ozone precursor emissions (emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC), Oxides of Nitrogen (NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), and Carbon Monoxide (CO)) for each ozone nonattainment area. This inventory must include base year (1990) emissions from point, area, on-road mobile, and non-road mobile anthropogenic (man-made) sources and biogenic (natural or plant generated) sources in the ozone nonattainment area(s) and the ozone precursor emissions from major stationary sources (with VOC, CO, or NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions equal to or exceeding 100 tons per year) located within 25 miles of the nonattainment area(s). The emissions inventory must be established for the peak ozone season (those months when peak hourly ozone concentrations occur in excess of the primary ozone NAAQS, generally June through August in Indiana) and must represent typical weekday emissions. Available guidance for preparing and reviewing the emission inventories is provided in the General Preamble to Title I of the Act. See 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992). Additional guidance is identified in the Technical Support Document (TSD) for this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act also requires States with ozone nonattainment areas designated as moderate, serious, severe, or extreme to submit a plan by November 15, 1993, to reduce VOC emissions by 15 percent by November 15, 1996. The baseline level of emissions, from which the 15 percent reduction is calculated, is determined by adjusting the base year emissions inventory to exclude biogenic emissions and certain emission reductions not creditable toward the 15 percent Reasonable Further Progress (RFP) requirement. The 1990 base year emissions inventory is the primary emissions inventory from which the RFP projection inventory, future periodic inventories, and attainment demonstration modeling inventories are derived. Further information on these inventories and their purposes can be found in the ``Emission Inventory Requirements for Ozone State Implementation Plans,'' U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, March 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

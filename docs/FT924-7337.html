			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Volex beats forecast with rise to Pounds 3.2m PRE-TAX PROFITS for the six months to September 30 at Volex, the electrical interconnection products company, comfortably exceeded the 86 per cent increase to Pounds 2.8m forecast in October, writes Peter Pearse. Mr Howard Poulson, chairman, said that September's results - not in at the time of the forecast - had been 'very good' and enabled pre-tax profits to more than double to Pounds 3.21m (Pounds 1.48m). Mr Poulson ascribed the advance in large part to the progressive reduction of exposure to UK markets, mainly via acquisitions, and to 'the strategic re-direction into higher margin products'. Sales from overseas operations accounted for some 47 per cent of group turnover of Pounds 42.7m (Pounds 41m) against 20 per cent last time. After October's Pounds 6.5m acquisition of Mayor, the Singapore-based maker of data and power cord assemblies, the figure will rise to about 60 per cent, Mr Poulson said. In wiring harnesses, which account for about a third of group sales, the move away from the high volume car production market saw the closure of the St Helens factory, which supplied Rover, and a greater emphasis on agricultural and commercial vehicles as well as other transport areas. Cable assemblies, boosted by the acquisitions of Cable Products in January 1992, Icontec in July 1993 and now Mayor, account for more than 50 per cent of group sales. Specialist cables suffered in the general economic climate but remained profitable. The interim dividend is maintained at 6.5p, payable from earnings per share of 11.7p (6.4p).</p>

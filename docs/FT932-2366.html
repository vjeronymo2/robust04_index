			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Collorgate protagonists breast moral tide: Despite public outrage, no-one has even been indicted yet ONE YEAR after the start of investigations which culminated in the impeachment of Brazil's President Fernando Collor on corruption charges, the alleged protagonists continue to enjoy their freedom. This is despite new evidence suggesting that the scandal involved billions rather than millions of dollars. But, stung by unfavourable comparisons with Italy, where hundreds of politicians and businessmen have been hauled before the courts and put behind bars, Brazil's lumbering justice system is finally starting to move. Since Tuesday, the Supreme Court has been holding daily interrogations of the main characters in the 'Collorgate' scandal. It was the first time that a former head of state had been questioned by the court, and Mr Collor described his four-hour session as 'absolute humiliation'. For many of the population who participated in last year's 'Pro-morality Movement' to oust Mr Collor, the timidity of the criminal process has reinforced the impression that corruption and immunity from prosecution reign amid the Brazilian elite even after impeachment. Few believe Mr Collor or his associates will go to jail and a recent public opinion survey revealed that 86 per cent of the population believed that crime was likely to go unpunished. A Supreme Court official retorts that with just 7,000 judges for a population of 150m they simply do not have enough manpower to act more quickly. Yet the Collorgate scheme now appears to have been much larger than originally thought. New evidence emerging from investigations by police and Kroll Associates, the international accounting firm, estimate the total amassed by Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, the alleged ringleader, as Dollars 1.4bn. Police allege that a large part of this came in bribes from overseas suppliers of Petrobras, the state oil company, paid into New York and then transferred to Swiss banks. Although federal prosecutors have accused more than 100 people of involvement, including Ms Zelia Cardoso, a former finance minister, not one has been tried, jailed or even indicted. Businessmen who admitted to paying kickbacks continue to do business. Ironically, the only person to be jailed so far is an American mechanic, Mr William Black, who is serving a sentence in the US for falsifying documents for Mr Farias's Miami-based air leasing company. Nor has a new, visibly cleaner, Brazil emerged. Lobbyists are back in the ministries, tax evasion continues unabated, and businessmen say commissions are still essential to secure contracts, though they have fallen to more 'reasonable' levels. Mr Jose Genoino, a congressman from the Workers' Party, complains: 'For lack of will to capitalise on the pro-morality mood we're losing a historic opportunity to carry out moral surgery on our institutions.' But another Congressman questions the wisdom of an Italian-style clean-up in a country which emerged from military rule just eight years ago. 'Can you imagine how many people are involved? We're talking about all major businessmen and politicians, judges, police. . . . our political system is not strong enough to take it,' he said. However, while corruption may continue, there have been changes in public perceptions and increased vigilance over public figures by the local press. Mr Innocencio Oliveira, president of congress and himself the subject of controversy for allegedly using aid money to drill wells on his own land, claims: 'Brazil has been transformed. There is far more rigour with public money and there is not the least possibility of anyone known to be corrupt being elected.' As evidence of this, Mr Orestes Quercia, who had been front runner for next year's presidential elections, recently resigned as leader of the country's biggest party, after an avalanche of allegations that he had pocketed millions of dollars during his term as Governor of Sao Paulo. Brazil's new president, Mr Itamar Franco, puts honesty above everything and has already sacked two ministers because of allegations of wrongdoing. In his court appearance this week, Mr Collor again denied the corruption charges, claiming that the money used for his personal expenses such as his notorious 'Babylonic gardens' was part of the Dollars 25m left over from his election campaign and a Dollars 4m loan from Uruguay. His insistence that he was the 'victim of special interests' trying to thwart his economic reforms, is weakened by the continuation of these policies under the present government. However, Mr Genoino says, 'if Collor is not brought to trial soon then we can expect increasing questions over whether morality was really behind his ouster'.</p>

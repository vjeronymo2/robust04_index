			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: Denmark seen as better risk than Sweden  -Capital &amp; Credit With the elections out of the way, a major risk factor for Swedish and Danish government bonds has been removed. However, following the establishment of minority governments in both countries and ahead of the Finnish and Swedish referenda on European Union membership, these markets are likely to remain volatile in coming months. Still, commitment to fiscal discipline by the new governments in both countries, accompanied by continued economic recovery, is likely to support both markets in 1995. Of the two, Denmark is widely seen to offer better prospects. 'Denmark's hard-core credentials are strong, but its bond yields are not in line with hard-core markets,' says Mr Kit Juckes, international economist at SG Warburg Securities. 'Of all the convergence trades in Europe, Danish bonds seem to have the most solid credentials.' With the budget deficit in decline, the economy growing steadily while inflation remains relatively subdued, Denmark's 'fundamental position would indicate an outperformance of bunds,' agrees Mr Paul Donovan, analyst at UBS. Danish bond yields rose sharply this year, largely on fears that the country's stronger than expected growth would fuel inflationary pressures. As a result, the yield spread over German bonds widened as far as 172 basis points in early September. It has narrowed considerably since then, however, partly due to rising German yields after strong economic data there, and partly to a reassessment of Denmark's fundamentals. On Friday, the Danish 10-year benchmark bond yielded 9.03 per cent, some 140 basis points over its German equivalent. 'Denmark's position at the vanguard of the European economic cycle has been supplanted,' says Mr Juckes. 'Its economy is growing in line with those in the rest of hard-core Europe.' He expects the Danish yield spread over Germany to converge to 100 basis points during the first half of 1995. The minority government is also unlikely to be a problem, given that this form of government has become much the norm in Denmark. The centre-left coalition is expected to seek support on its economic policies from the right wing in parliament, and is unlikely to bow to pressure from the far-left, analysts say. The main risk to the Danish market is likely to come from external sources. Despite the favourable domestic economic climate, uncertainty over Sweden's political situation and the post-election handling of Sweden's deficits may have a spill-over effect, warns Ms Cathy Savage, of Nomura. 'It also seems likely that, despite being firmly rooted within the EU itself, the uncertainty over whether Finland, Sweden and Norway will vote in favour of EU membership is having an impact as a background 'confidence' issue for Denmark,' she adds. In Sweden, the outlook is more murky and it may take a while before investors regain confidence in the bond market. Recent years have seen a sharp increase in the budget deficit and public-sector debt, resulting largely from the country's deep recession. However, economic recovery and a package of spending cuts and tax rises announced by the Social Democrats are hoped to break the circle which has undermined the currency and pushed yields higher this year. Swedish 10-year yields rose to 12.05 per cent in August, from a low of 6.65 in January, with the spread over bunds widening as far as 494 basis points. On Friday, the yield was back at 11.17 per cent and the spread stood at 354 basis points but analysts warn that the market will remain vulnerable to further setbacks in coming months. 'We're not very bullish on the market near-term - there is so much uncertainty,' says Mr Allen Owie, senior analyst at Unibank Securities in Copenhagen. On Friday, the government is due to unveil its economic policy programme; in mid-October, a new central-bank supervisory board and governor are to be appointed, creating uncertainty over the Riksbank's monetary policy stance; and in January the 1995 budget will be unveiled. Before the budget debate heats up, however, Sweden's referendum on EU membership on November 13 will take centre stage, following the Finnish EU vote on October 16. A positive EU vote would have a very positive effect on the bond market, Mr Owie says. 'If Sweden agrees to EU membership, its economic policy framework will be dictated by external factors, which is very bullish in the longer term.' Another risk is a possible rating move by Moody's, the US agency. While Standard &amp; Poor's recently affirmed its AA+ rating, fears of a downgrading by Moody's later in the year has scared the market. If the EU referendum yields a 'yes,' Moody's leaves its Aa2 rating unchanged and the government produces a fiscally austere budget package, Swedish bonds could be in for a rally in early 1995, Mr Donovan predicts. Until then, however, investors will be in for a bumpy ride.</p>

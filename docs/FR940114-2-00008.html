This EIS will tier to the Kootenai National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan and EIS, which provide overall guidance for achieving the desired forest condition of the area. The purpose of the proposed action is to harvest dead, dying or high risk (to mountain pine beetle infestation) stands of lodgepole pine to reduce potential excessive future natural fuel loadings, increase the health and productivity of stands that are currently declining in vigor and provide a more balanced distribution of timber age classes in the Project Area. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments and suggestions should be received no later than February 28, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Send written comments to John R.

Approximately six miles of new specified road would be constructed and 2 miles of existing road would be reconstructed. Approximately 1.5 miles of temporary road would be required and approximately .6 miles of constructed skid trail. With this proposed action, a portion of the roadless areas may be affected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are a variety of purposes for timber harvest and reforestation in the South Fork Yaak area; the primary purposes are: (1) To improve timber productivity by replacing stands of dead dying or high risk lodgepole pine with younger, more vigorously growing trees; (2) to salvage the dead and lodgepole pine; (3) to reduce potentially future catastrophic wildfire conditions by removal of natural dead or dying fuels; and (4) to increase the overall health and vigor of other stands being considered for management. Additionally, the purpose of road construction and reconstruction is to facilitate access to the timber stands to be harvested. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The project area consists of approximately 13,234 acres located in Sections 2&hyph;11, 4&hyph;22, 28&hyph;30, T34N, R31W; Sections 1, 12, 13, 24, 25, T34N, R32W; Sections 29&hyph;34, T35N, R31W; and Section 36, T35N, R32W; P.M.M., Lincoln County, Montana. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The decision to be made is what, if anything, should be done in the South Fork Yaak River Project Area to: (a) Increase timber health and productivity and contribute to the Forest's sustained yield of timber products, (b) reduce natural fuel loadings of dead and dying lodgepole pine as a result of past and potential mountain pine beetle infestations, (c) dispose of slash and reforest harvested lands, (d) develop and manage the road system to facilitate removal of timber, reforest stands and maintain or improve wildlife security and (e) create a situation of better age class distributions of stands within project area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Kootenai Forest Plan provides guidance for management activities within the potentially affected area through its goals, objectives, standards and guidelines, and management area direction. The areas of proposed timber harvest and reforestation would occur within Management Areas 12, 15, 17 and 14. Timber harvest would occur only on suitable timber land. Road construction and reconstruction would occur in these four management areas. Below is a brief description of the applicable management direction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management Area 12_These are areas that contain productive timber lands which are suitable for timber harvest, provided that big game summer habitat objectives are met. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management Area 14_These are areas that contain productive timber lands which are suitable for timber harvest, provided that grizzly bear habitat objectives are met. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management Area 15_These are areas that contain productive timber lands which are suitable for timber harvest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management Area 17_These are areas that contain productive timber lands which are suitable for timber harvest, viewing objectives are met. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Forest Service will consider a range of alternatives. One of these will be the ``no action'' alternative, in which none of the proposed activities will be implemented. Additional alternatives will examine varying levels and locations for the proposed activities to achieve the proposal's purposes, as well as to respond to the issues and other resource values. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: Bosch-Siemens casts eye over new ground - Herbert Worner speaks to Andrew Baxter about expansion in and out of Germany Mr Herbert Worner concedes it is fashionable to knock manufacturing in Germany as too costly and uncompetitive. However, the president and chief executive of Bosch-Siemens Hausgerate says: 'We would not go along with that on a general basis.' The wisdom, or otherwise, of manufacturing in Germany is an important issue for Mr Worner. Bosch-Siemens is the most German and least global of the big three white goods producers in Europe - Electrolux of Sweden is market leader and Whirlpool of the US is in third place. Mr Worner wants to change that, at least partially, and says Bosch-Siemens is developing a better manufacturing base to support his plans. The group has been working behind the scenes to reduce its domestic production costs and raise productivity. A re-organisation that began in 1991 and was completed last summer has significantly reduced costs, says Mr Worner. Over the past three or four years, he says, the company's components sourcing policy has changed fundamentally. 'We used to buy much more in Germany,' he says. If the quality is good, Bosch-Siemens is now open to buying components in the UK, Italy and Spain. Recently, it has been holding 'buyers' meetings' in Hungary, the Czech Republic, Russia and the Ukraine, where potential parts suppliers are shown a complete machine and asked whether they can supply components. Mr Worner sees two very good reasons why Bosch-Siemens will continue manufacturing at its five plants in Germany. First, in an industry where economies of scale are vital to manufacturing competitiveness, the group can boast the world's biggest plants in a number of product lines. Secondly, labour costs may be higher in Germany than elsewhere in Europe, but there are logistical advantages to manufacturing in a country which accounts for one-third of the DM45bn (Dollars 27.3bn) west European white goods market, and where Bosch has a market share of more than 30 per cent. Bosch-Siemens has even been expanding its German manufacturing. A new factory at Nauen in eastern Germany will start producing 400,000 driers a year from next year, and manufacturing of cooker hobs is being added at the Bretten factory south of Frankfurt. Any further expansion of manufacturing will, however, be outside Germany. Already, Bosch-Siemens has five factories in Spain - the legacy of two important Spanish acquisitions in 1988 and 1989 - one in Greece, and one in Slovenia making small appliances. A washing machine plant at Lodz, Poland, is due to start production at the beginning of next year. It is not hard to see why Bosch-Siemens is now looking beyond Germany. The strength of the D-Mark and the recession in many European countries means that, out of total sales of DM6.66bn last year, non-German turnover dipped to 42 per cent, compared with 50 per cent in 1989 and 1990. In western Europe, Dr Worner wants to raise Bosch-Siemens' share of the market from 15 per cent to between 18 and 19 per cent within five years. He says: 'We can now better work on those markets in Europe where our market shares are relatively low.' In eastern Europe, he thinks Bosch-Siemens can raise its sales from DM150m this year to between DM500m and DM600m in five years, mainly in Russia, Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. He is also keen to expand Bosch-Siemens' position in Asia, where current sales of DM70m-DM80m could be multiplied in the next few years. As a first step, the group has signed a letter of intent with a Chinese company to produce washing machines and, ultimately, other white goods there. Meanwhile, Bosch-Siemens' Spanish companies are being used as a springboard to the Latin American market.</p>

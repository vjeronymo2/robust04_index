			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 9 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa has refunded some of a loan extended by Sagawa Kyubin,  a scandal-tainted trucking company, according to a newly-found  document obtained by KYODO NEWS SERVICE.    Hosokawa, who on Friday [8 April] abruptly announced his  intention to resign, has come under attack over a 100 million  yen loan he took from Sagawa Kyubin, as well as another  financial deal related to the purchase of shares in Nippon  Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT). Although Hosokawa has told  the Diet he paid back the 100 million yen to Sagawa Kyubin, the  opposition has alleged that he failed to do so, making the loan  a de facto secret donation.    The newly found document is apparently a photocopy of part  of  Sagawa Kyubin's accounting data. It seemed to be copied from  printed computer data of the company's accounts between 1986 and  1988. It says the data are the item of loans extended by Sagawa  Kyubin from the firm's balance sheet book.    According to the data, Hosokawa refunded 10 million yen  respectively on May 28, 1986, February 10, 1987 and February 17,  1988.    The dates and the amounts of money are the same as previous  data submitted last December by Sagawa Kyubin to the Diet.  However, the new document suggests the money was paid back  through a bank, contrary to Hosokawa's explanation to the Diet  that he had his secretary carry cash to refund Sagawa Kyubin.    Minao Hattori of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party  said  the loan which Hosokawa had his secretary refund may be a  different loan from that stated in the new document.    The document was kept by a former Sagawa Kyubin employee who  has entrusted it to an acquaintance. A former Sagawa Kyubin  executive said the document apparently is of Sagawa Kyubin.</p>

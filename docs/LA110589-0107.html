			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE ISSUE OF RAISING SALES TAX FOR ROADS  </P> <P> It was with a great deal of disappointment that I read your editorial espousing  Measure M. It would only encourage the developers to build more and restore  gridlock. Besides that, why do you favor the most unfair method of taxation  such as an increase in sales tax, which falls on all of us, including those  poor souls on welfare?  </P> <P> Why not the fairest method of taxation, a surcharge or increase in the income  tax where those who can afford more will pay more. This can also apply to the  proposed increase in the gas tax to pay for the catastrophe of the recent  earthquake. The more affluent pay for the needier.  </P> <P> HARRY BERNSTEIN  </P> <P> Seal Beach  </P></p>

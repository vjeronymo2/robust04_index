			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Banks back Pounds 100m emergency funding for Olympia &amp; York OLYMPIA &amp; York, the world's biggest property developer, which last night admitted it has been facing a liquidity crisis, has raised more than Pounds 100m of emergency bank facilities to continue work on projects including its Canary Wharf development, Europe's biggest office project. The Canadian company said it would shortly hold talks with its leading bank creditors on restructuring its worldwide debt, estimated at more than Pounds 5bn. O&amp;Y said in addition to the emergency standby loans - of which Pounds 52m was provided in London for Canary Wharf and the balance in Toronto for O&amp;Y working capital - the group had arranged facilities to help retire CDollars 380m (Pounds 184m) of its outstanding commercial paper. Some of these latter funds will come from the sale of the group's equity stake in Interprovincial Pipelines, the leading Canadian oil pipeline company. O&amp;Y has been unable to roll over the commercial paper due to what the Dominion Bond Rating Service of Canada last week termed an 'unprecedented lack of investor confidence.' The official said: 'Speculation surrounding the commercial paper programme created a liquidity crisis which delayed arrangements for other sources of finance.' The next step would be 'to move forward with discussions with our banks', he said. JP Morgan, the New York bank and a leading O&amp;Y creditor, is expected to be named in the next few days as adviser to O&amp;Y on its debt restructuring. A consortium of about 10 banks, including Barclays and Lloyds of the UK, were encouraged by the Bank of England to put up the Pounds 52m for work to continue at Canary Wharf. It emerged yesterday that Mr Pen Kent, a director of the Bank of England, had played a key role in funneling information from O&amp;Y and the Canadian central bank to banks lending to the Canary Wharf project. Bankers in London said that they had been encouraged by the Bank of England to participate in the emergency funding, but denied they had been under pressure to do so. One banker said the request for the funds came at the beginning of last week. 'They will be able to draw on the funds as they need them, but only in consultation with the banks'. It is a short-term facility, lasting a few months. The loan is secured on property at Canary Wharf and on other assets. It has prior claim on O&amp;Y's assets ahead of the main Pounds 500m loan for the construction of Canary Wharf, which was provided by a consortium of 12 banks, most of which are involved in the new smaller facility. 'The Canadian end (of O&amp;Y) had been feeding the cash requirements of Canary Wharf', said another banker involved in providing the new funds yesterday. 'But the cash ran out', he added. The sudden demand for the new UK money was said to have demonstrated that O&amp;Y needed to restructure its worldwide borrowings, taken out from a total of 70 banks. A meeting of its banks is likely within two weeks, probably in Toronto. One banker said that in any debt restructuring, O&amp;Y would probably be given sufficient funds to finish those buildings already started at Canary Wharf. 'If I have my way, they would have to shelve everything else', he said.</p>

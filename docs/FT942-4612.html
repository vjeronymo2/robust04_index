			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / HK to release building land The Hong Kong government yesterday announced measures, including an increase in the supply of land for residential development and changes to the way builders bring property to market, which it hopes will check the rate of price rises in Hong Kong's overheated residential property market. The government's overriding objective has been to be seen doing something about rising house prices, but not enough to precipitate a crash in the value of what remains most people's principal asset. Yesterday's mainly supply-side measures were seen by analysts as fitting that requirement. The government said it planned to allocate an extra 70 hectares of land for residential development in the years before 1997-98, including 15ha in the current year. The release of this land, however, will need China's approval. Beijing has in the past indicated its concern about property prices but has yet to give its response. The government also reminded China that an early agreement on financing Hong Kong's new airport would free even more land for residential development. The government has asked property developers to cut to 10 per cent from 50 per cent the number of flats they allocate to insiders, such as staff and associates. On current levels of construction this would add 10,000 flats to the open market. It has also made changes to rules governing the pre-sale of housing and its financing. Mr David Faulkner, partner with Brooke Hillier Parker, a firm of surveyors, said: 'I think it's going to dampen enthusiasm. But it won't lead to a crash, there are too many genuine buyers out there.' Residential property in Hong Kong has become prohibitively expensive for ordinary people. A 600 sq ft flat on the south side of Hong Kong island costs about HKDollars 3.5m (Pounds 301,000). The market has been propelled upwards by strong demand from the mainland - where a Hong Kong flat is seen as a status symbol - and the growth of the colony as a financial and business centre for foreigners doing business in China. The government said it would monitor the effect on property prices of yesterday's measures. If 'excessive speculation' continued it would consider introducing tougher measures, such as punitive stamp duty on short-term transactions and financial penalties for hoarders of empty flats.</p>

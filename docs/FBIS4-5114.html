			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 7 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu met his visiting Icelandic counterpart Jon  Hannibalsson Thursday and discussed the North Korean nuclear  issue and other international affairs as well as ways to expand  bilateral economic cooperation.    Han sought Iceland's support in Korea's hope to be a  non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and  join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  (OECD) by 1996.    Discussing economic cooperation, Hannibalsson asked Seoul to  widen doors for fishery imports.    After talks with Han, Hannibalsson paid a courtesy call on  President Kim Yong-sam and spoke in a seminar at the Institute  of Foreign Affairs and National Security.    He will visit the inter-Korean truce village of Panmunjom,  Daewoo business group headquarters, and Hyundai dockyard in  Ulsan before leaving Korea on Sunday.</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / International Company News: Sharp drop in profit predicted by Bridgestone BRIDGESTONE, the Japanese tyre and sports goods company, has forecast a 27 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y27bn (Dollars 216m) for the six months to June 1992, reflecting the downturn in the domestic car industry. The company also revised downwards its forecast for full-year profits from Y73bn to Y70bn as it and most other manufacturers are accepting that the hoped-for recovery of the Japanese economy is likely to be delayed until at least late in the year. Sales for the first half are expected to total Y340bn, down from an earlier estimate of Y355bn and from the Y348bn reported last year, with sales of car and truck tyres falling in line with production cutbacks by Japanese manufacturers. Domestic demand for sports goods, in particular, golf clubs and tennis equipment, has slowed, and export earnings have been bruised by the recent appreciation of the yen. The company has profited from the shift towards studless tyres for winter driving and expects that production of this model will increase later this year. But the most serious problem remains the weak domestic demand for new cars, which has also hurt demand for its rubber components for the motor industry. Until June, new car registrations had fallen in Japan for 13 consecutive months, and parts suppliers are hoping that a 0.5 per cent increase last month is an indication that demand will strengthen in coming months. But signs are that recovery will be slow and most Japanese companies are likely to be forced to announce downward profit revisions, as predictions had been founded on expectations of a quick recovery. Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan governor, yesterday said the economy was still in an 'adjustment phase', suggesting that even the generally optimistic central bank was reassessing its forecasts for an upturn.</p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fear of LME scuppered US merger  -The abandonment of a planned market marriage THE THREAT of surging volume growth at the London Metals Exchange, and the perception that the UK's commodities trading regulations are less restrictive than those in the US, were the primary reasons why the Chicago Board of Trade, the world's largest futures exchange, decided against acquiring New York's Commodity Exchange (Comex), the LME's chief rival, says Mr Patrick Arbor, the CBoT chairman. 'The UK regulatory environment is more conducive to growth,' said Mr Arbor. 'Take a look at the growth of the LME and the International Petroleum Exchange, relative to the Comex and the New York Mercantile Exchange. We think that has something to do with the regulatory operating environment.' Mr Arbor complains that compared to London, the paperwork required for opening customer accounts in the US is prohibitive, that more compliance people are required, and that in general 'the London regulatory environment is a lot more liberal, less constrictive, and less costly'. The LME's market share and its comparative regulatory advantage raised questions about the cost-savings expected from the CBoT/Comex merger, Mr Arbor said. A CBoT committee last week recommended that the merger, which had been unpopular with Comex members, be abandoned. The Comex is currently considering a takeover plan from its neighbour the Nymex. LME volume grew by 46 per cent last year to 24.7m contracts. Comex, in contrast, saw a 16 per cent drop in volume last year, to 12.7m contracts. In the energy sector, Nymex had volume of 47.2m contracts, a 16 per cent gain over 1991, while London's IPE saw growth of 26 per cent, to 10.7m contracts. The Comex trades primarily precious metals, while the LME specialises in base metals. Their two product lines overlap, however, with high grade copper. In copper, the LME has by far the dominant market share. Mr Arbor said the regulatory discrepancies and their impact on the Comex's world competitiveness were brought home when a committee of CBoT accountants and attorneys reviewed the Comex's books after he and Ms Donna Redel, Comex chairwoman, signed the merger proposal January 25. In fact, the relative volume growth at the LME could hardly have been a surprise to Mr Arbor, since his exchange is keenly conscious of market share lost overseas. Mr Arbor and other CBoT officials have been vocal critics of US futures regulation for years, and have frequently led the US futures industry in drives to defeat legislation it thought would constrain competition. In this case Mr Arbor may be using the LME as an example against a Clinton administration proposal to tax futures transactions. 'If we continue to have a harsher regulatory environment, and if the 14-cent (per contract) transaction tax is approved, we risk seeing more and more US business going overseas,' he said. The Comex review did expose CBoT management more directly to world competition that it rarely sees in its own operations. The CBoT's biggest business is futures and options trading in grain and in US government bonds and notes. None of those products have serious global competition. While some small grain contracts, most notably in Tokyo and Paris, have sprung up in recent years, none can compare with the size of the US market, either in futures volume or in grain production. Gold and silver, the Comex's major products, are more generic and thus more vulnerable to competing interests, Mr Arbor says. In fact, data provided by the US Futures Industry Association show that in pure volume terms, Comex gold futures volume took a back seat to the upstart BM &amp; F exchange in Brazil last year. Brazilian gold options jumped to second place in world metals contract rankings in 1992, with volume at 8m contracts, while Comex gold futures fell from second to fourth, at 6m. The LME took first and third place in the rankings, with its aluminium and copper futures. The volume rankings are deceptive because contract size varies, and a single Comex gold future represents almost ten times as much gold as a Brazilian gold option. Still, competitive pressures remain as trading interest grows outside the US. US futures industry officials have said that the rational response to those pressures is to cut costs. After significant consolidation of futures brokerage firms in the 1980s, they expected to see similar rationalisation among US exchanges in this decade. The Comex's quest for an operating partner is just the beginning of that movement, they say.</p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Ladbroke The initial impression from Ladbroke's results is not encouraging. The 29 per cent fall in pre-tax profits would have been greater were it not for Pounds 44m earned on the sale of two provincial hotels in the UK. Net borrowings would have risen by about Pounds 100m without the Pounds 464m rights issue. The racing business, which should be richly cash generative, had a bad year, leaving Texas Homecare as the only good performer. That said, the hotel division is now showing signs of recovery, though activity is not back to the 1990 level. Ladbroke's policy of selling off hotels while retaining a management contract will alleviate the cash burden of expanding this sector - a further Pounds 40m or so of sales is expected this year. Similarly the company also managed to generate profits of Pounds 20m last year by disposing of property at prices above current downgraded book values. Indeed, if Ladbroke really has been as conservative as it claims in valuing its property portfolio, then the worries which have led its shares to underperform the market by 30 per cent over the past two years may finally be on the wane. But, despite the sales, its portfolio is still large, valued at roughly Pounds 1bn, and one whose value has mostly to be taken on trust. With a holding that includes 500,000 sq ft of unlet space in the UK and more than 800,000 in the US, Ladbroke is still a hostage of the property market. Despite the 2 per cent rise in its shares yesterday it would not do for investors to get carried away until that market improves.</p>

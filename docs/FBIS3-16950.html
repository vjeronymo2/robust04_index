			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Riga, Mar 21, BNS -- Swedish-Latvians'  organizations issued a statement Monday [21 March] protesting  the initialed agreement between Latvia and Russia on the Skrunda  radar station and the status of retired Russian servicemen in  the Baltic country.    The Latvian Government in fact legalized the Russian  occupation by initialing the agreement, according to the  statement.    The organizations urge the Saeima (parliament) to decline  the  agreement's ratification because the document is evidently  hostile to the intersts of the Latvian nation. It may also  provoke unpredictable consequences in the future.    The group also calls on President Guntis Ulmanis not to sign  the document.    The statement is signed by the Latvian National Independence  Movement's Swedish department, the Latvian National Fund, the  Swedish-Latvians Central Council and the Swedish Daugavas Vanagi  organization.</p>

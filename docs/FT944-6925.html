			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / UN and Nato fail to prevent Serb push into Bihac Serb fighters and their allies in a renegade Moslem force said they had advanced further into the town of Bihac last night, despite intensive mediation efforts by the United Nations and apparent fresh air action by Nato. First accounts conflicted on whether Nato aircraft had struck at targets or had merely buzzed Serb positions in the area. Officials of the western alliance in Brussels declined immediately to confirm that any operation had taken place. The advance by Bosnian Serb ground forces into the poorly defended town centre, which is supposedly protected by UN resolutions, was reported by the Belgrade news agency Tanjug. General Manojlo Milanovic, the Bosnian Serb chief of staff, demanded that the government army in Bihac surrender by this evening, warning: 'If you don't listen to me, I can't guarantee your lives.' Fighters loyal to Mr Fikret Abdic, a maverick local Moslem leader who opposes the Sarajevo leadership, have been advancing on government positions in tandem with the Serbs. A radio station controlled by Mr Abdic said 400 of his men had entered Bihac town. Before the latest move forward was reported, the Serbs were said to be in control of about one-fifth of the notionally protected zone consisting of Bihac town and its environs. The latest Serb advance followed the announcement by the UN of a ceasefire in the Bihac area, and a day of bitter arguments between the UN and the Bosnian government as to how badly and by whom it was being violated. The Bosnian government, adamant that the UN was failing in its obligation to protect the town, said it was coming under heavy shellfire despite the truce. UN officials claimed that the ceasefire had initially held out fairly well, and they accused the Bosnian army of firing out of the town with the intention ofprovoking retaliation by the Serbs. This tactic had eventually worked, they said. The UN was also trying yesterday to negotiate a ceasefire throughout Bosnia, a proposal which was approved in principle by both the Serbs and the Moslem-led government. However the two sides' ceasefire terms seemed to be mutually exclusive. The Serbs wanted an indefinite ceasefire, while the government side - wary of freezing the existing battle lines - called for a three-month truce only. Mr Jovan Zametica, an adviser to the Bosnian Serb leadership, set tough conditions for the 'demilitarisation' of Bihac, saying: 'We Serbs have the legitimate right to defeat and disarm the . . . government forces.'

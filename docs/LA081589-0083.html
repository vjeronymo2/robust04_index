			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> MAN SEIZED FOR ALLEGED THREAT TO SHOOT ANCHORWOMAN LANGE  </P> <P> An infatuated fan who wrote letters and sent gifts to news anchor Kelly Lange  for five years was arrested for allegedly threatening to shoot the KNBC-TV  newswoman, authorities said Monday.  </P> <P> Warren Sevy Hudson, who allegedly told a co-worker that he was "bored with life  and that he was going to Burbank to shoot Kelly Lange," was charged with making  a terrorist threat on the Channel 4 anchorwoman.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County district attorney's office said that for five years,  Hudson, 57, had been writing letters, making phone calls and sending gifts to  Lange, which were returned.  </P> <P> A KNBC executive contacted the district attorney's office Thursday and said he  had been notified of the threat, which was allegedly made Wednesday,  authorities said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lost Job  </P> <P> Police launched an investigation, interviewed the co-worker and found out that  Hudson had been fired Thursday from his job as a laborer at a gold bullion  exchange.  </P> <P> Hudson was arrested Friday at a motel where he lived. Police said they  recovered a .38-caliber Colt revolver and ammunition when they arrested him.  </P> <P> Hudson was scheduled to be arraigned today. The district attorney's office said  it would ask for $50,000 bail.  </P> <P> Lange and KNBC had no comment on the arrest, station spokeswoman Regina  Miyamoto said.  </P> <P> "This is in the hands of the police, the district attorney and the courts,"  Miyamoto said.  </P> <P> A recent spate of threats and acts of violence against celebrities have  produced concern and even legislation on the issue of celebrity safety.  </P> <P> In June, a state parole board delayed for at least nine months the release of  Arthur Jackson, convicted of a nearly fatal knife attack on actress Theresa  Saldana in 1982. From prison, Jackson wrote letters threatening Saldana.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Inspired Law  </P> <P> Jackson's eligibility for parole after serving seven years of a 12-year prison  sentence has been assailed by Saldana. It inspired a new state law to keep  violent, mentally ill prisoners in mental hospitals after they complete their  sentences.  </P> <P> In July, police arrested a Canadian woman who loitered around NBC-TV studios in  Burbank for several days and refused orders to leave, as fans lined up to see  "The Tonight Show With Johnny Carson." Guards found an 11-inch knife in her  backpack.  </P> <P> On July 18, Robert John Bardo, 19, is alleged to have shot actress Rebecca  Schaeffer to death at the door of her Los Angeles apartment. Bardo has been  described as an "obsessed fan" of the 21-year-old actress.  </P></p>

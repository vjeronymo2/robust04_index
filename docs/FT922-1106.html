			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Insurers crack down on 'dodgy claims' THE INSURANCE industry yesterday promised a 'blitz' on fraud as it launched a campaign to combat bogus and inflated claims, which cost it an estimated Pounds 400m last year. Mr Mike Jones, chief executive of the Association of British Insurers, which is co-ordinating the effort, said: 'We aim to identify, spotlight and prosecute the fraudsters. They must not be allowed to get away with dodgy claims.' Fraud by policyholders has added to the problems of the industry, which announced record trading losses of Pounds 3.3bn last year. Mr Ian Rushton, chairman of the association, said: 'In the UK, for every Pounds 1 of premium collected, insurance companies suffered Pounds 1.30 in claims and expenses.' The association will tackle fraud with an advertising campaign featuring case studies of successful prosecutions, which will 'remind the public that cheating is a crime'. Cases include 'Arthur', who claimed for a new TV set after pretending that his old one was damaged, and 'Sally', who added a few things to her insurance claim after a video was stolen from her house. 'Arthur' was reported by his neighbours after boasting about his plans, while 'Sally's' plans to cheat came unstuck when the thieves came clean about the robbery after they were caught. The campaign, which will cost Pounds 250,000, was launched after a Gallup poll, commissioned by the association, revealed a widespread public belief that insurance fraud was extensive. Of a sample of 1,000 adults interviewed 21 per cent knew of someone who had put forward a false or inflated claim and 80 per cent thought insurance fraud was a 'serious or very serious problem'. Reflecting on the industry's results, Mr Rushton said that the current level of claims costs was 'unacceptable'. He warned that the 'average family' must expect to pay Pounds 10 per month more for home and motor insurance this year. Motor insurers reported underwriting losses of Pounds 1.2bn. Fire and accident losses rose to Pounds 3.3bn, compared with Pounds 1.9bn in 1990, while mortgage indemnity losses amounted to Pounds 1.2bn. The cost of motor theft claims was up 36 per cent. Subsidence cost Pounds 540m, more than four times as much as usual. The one bright spot is continued strong growth in life assurance. Total premium income increased by 17.8 per cent.</p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Paris shrugs off Rwanda threat France is seeking rapid United Nations approval for its plan to send forces to the Rwandan border as part of a humanitarian mission despite a warning from Rwandan rebels yesterday that they would regard French intervention as hostile. Paris is hoping for the go-ahead from the UN security council today or tomorrow, government officials said yesterday. President Francois Mitterrand said France wanted to send forces to Rwanda without waiting for the formation of a full UN force. 'Increasingly savage fighting is taking place and one can no longer wait. This is a matter of great urgency,' he said. The decision to send forces to support a humanitarian effort in Rwanda's civil war was announced in a joint statement on Saturday from the offices of President Mitterrand and Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister. The statement said that the operation would be limited to the transitional period before the arrival of a larger UN force to support the existing 450-strong UN Rwandan mission. Senior French defence officials met last night to discuss details of the operation. A government spokesman declined to comment on how and where the French forces might operate. But he said that the dispatch of French troops was conditional on UN approval and on the participation of other countries. Mr Francois Leotard, the defence minister, ruled out the possibility that France would go it alone. Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister said, however, that he had received a commitment from Senegal to send troops. French officials said a few other African countries had also responded favourably to French requests for support. However no European countries are prepared to contribute troops. Last night Italy, which earlier had said it might lend support, made clear it had no intention of taking part. According to Mr Juppe, French troops could be sent to the Rwandan border as early as this week or next week. Officials in Paris indicated the forces could amount to between 1,000 and 2,000 troops. Rwanda's rebel leaders yesterday warned France to keep out of the country, saying they would regard a French-led military intervention as hostile. The Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), said France's 'humanitarian' initiative was a pretext to deny the rebels an outright victory against the French-armed and French-trained government forces in Rwanda. 'The French are not a neutral party to this conflict,' Mr Carlos Mugambage, an RPF spokesman, said from the capital, Kigali. 'They are partly responsible for the chaos and massacres in Rwanda. Their presence would only complicate the situation here.' In Kigali yesterday heavy fighting erupted and a Red Cross worker was killed when a hospital complex in the government-held city centre was hit by a mortar bomb. The rebels' hostility towards France is based on material and financial support Paris gave to the government of Gen Juvenal Habyarimana, a member of the majority Hutu tribe and Rwanda's military leader until his death in an aircraft crash on April 6. When the RPF launched its civil war in 1990, France bolstered Gen Habyarimana's crumbling army with military advisers, weapons, armoured cars and helicopters. It also sent more than 300 French troops. Paris denies its forces fought the guerrillas, but several independent reports speak of French soldiers manning roadblocks and helping government troops defend the frontline. Mr Juppe said he hoped to convince the RPF that the French operation would be exclusively humanitarian.</p>

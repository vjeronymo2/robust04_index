			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Management: Nuclear Electric - Facing a deadline of megawatt proportions / The challenge of introducing a commercial ethos High on any list of companies ripe for a turnround would be Nuclear Electric, the state-owned operator of 12 nuclear power stations in England and Wales. Morale in the industry is at rock-bottom, following the UK government's decision in late 1989 not to privatise the nuclear stations. Public confidence in nuclear power is, if possible, even lower. Not only has the industry been contaminated by the fall-out from nuclear disasters like that at Chernobyl; its claims that power was cheap were also shown to be misleading during the privatisation process. Yet Nuclear Electric, created just a year ago and with its first corporate plan newly landed on ministers' desks, has only until 1994 to get its act together. That is when the government has promised to review the future of nuclear power. At stake is the question of whether any new stations should be built after Sizewell, the only nuclear station now under construction in Britain. The man with one of the most difficult management tasks in Britain is John Collier, Nuclear Electric's 56-year old chairman. A life-long nuclear engineer and proud author of the standard textbook on 'convective boiling and condensation', Collier is turning his mind to the messier arts of cost-cutting, team-building and politics. For the first time in its 35-year life, nuclear power in Britain has powerful commercial competitors. Nuclear Power is in direct competition with National Power and PowerGen, the newly privatised fossil fuel generators, for any growth in electricity demand which emerges in the 1990s. It is scarcely surprising, therefore, that the policies adopted by Nuclear Electric to sharpen up its commercial performance resemble those favoured by National Power and PowerGen in the run-up to privatisation. Central to these is the new designation of Nuclear Electric's power stations as profit centres. This more commercial ethos is being overseen by Mike Kirwan who left consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte last year to become Nuclear Electric's finance director, and is one of a raft of private sector managers imported into the finance and commercial functions. 'We want to transmit the profit motive downwards to managers in charge of the power stations, which in the past would have been regarded as cost centres, but now are profit centres,' says Kirwan. The operational heart of this programme is a new system of internal markets, described by Kirwan as 'a pretty fundamental change in the way we run the business'. In future, Nuclear Electric's departments which provide an array of costly technological services for the power stations will have to bid for the business. Station managers will be free to accept an internal bid or to look outside for cheaper services. Coupled with a new system of performance-related pay for managers, Nuclear Electric views internal tendering as crucial to improving its efficiency. Committed to an 'aggressive headcount reduction', Nuclear Electric's senior managers admit privately that staffing in the old Central Electricity Generating Board was 'gold-plated'. Last year, staff costs amounted to Pounds 305m, a sixth of the total. John Collier has announced a target of scything 2,500 out of its workforce of 14,000 by 1994. Other measures in Nuclear Electric's corporate plan to boost profits include: Improving AGR performance. The five stations which use advanced gas-cooled reactors, a design unique to the UK, have been notoriously poor performers. Even last year, when they recorded their best ever performance, they produced less than 23 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity against a theoretical maximum of 40TWh. Higher output from the AGRs would not be matched by a corresponding increase in costs, so increasing their production is fundamental to Nuclear Electric's short-term prospects. John Collier, who says the AGRs are overcoming their fuel-handling problems, holds out the prospect of the AGRs producing 30TWh within three years. Collier says Hartlepool and Heysham 1, two of the less efficient AGRs, are 'coming good'. He is less sanguine about Dungeness B, which has typically performed at less than 20 per cent of potential. 'If in two to three years' time, it is still failing to generate significant amounts of power, we will have to look at its continuation very seriously.' Extending the life of Magnox stations. The seven stations which use Magnox reactors, the oldest commercial reactor in the world, present a different problem. There is little scope for squeezing more output from these workhorses, but Nuclear Electric wants to extend their lives, since all their capital costs are sunk. Collier says the marginal cost of electricity from the Magnoxes is less than 1.5p a unit (kilowatt/hour), way below the costs of competing fuels. Nuclear Electric has put three options for extending the Magnoxes to the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, the safety watchdogs. Under the most ambitious, the lifetime of the stations would be extended to between 33 and 37 years. The inspectorate's permission will be needed to keep the stations open beyond 25 years. Cheaper decommissioning and waste management. Nuclear Electric now backs a novel decommissioning route which does not involve dismantling old nuclear stations. Instead, the reactor building would be sealed in concrete and left under observation for about 135 years. After that, the site would be mounded over and could be opened to the public as a picnic spot. Whether the public will feel happy frolicking on top of an old nuclear reactor remains to be seen, but the attractions for Nuclear Electric are clear; it reckons it would shave more than Pounds 1bn off the Pounds 3.5bn discounted cost of decommissioning its nuclear stations. In parallel, Nuclear Electric is in the middle of long-running negotiations with British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL), the state-owned nuclear waste operator, about cutting the cost of waste reprocessing. Nuclear Electric wants to replace the current regime of cost-plus contracts with a new fixed-price system. Since BNFL's charges account for a quarter to a third of Nuclear Electric's costs, the potential savings are again substantial. Taken together, this strategy is designed to double operating profits after eight years, a more aggressive target than that agreed with the government when Nuclear Electric was formally created last year. At the time, Nuclear Electric committed itself to achieving broadly the same operating profits after eight years as last year, namely Pounds 225m. Improvements in performance were planned to match the decline in income from its government-backed subsidy - a levy on all electricity bills. Senior executives recognise, however, that even the new target will not be enough to deliver a return on capital which would rank as satisfactory in the private sector. Put another way, even if Nuclear Electric succeeds in all its aims, its power will still cost much more than that from new stations burning gas, the fuel of choice in the rest of the industry. Comparing the cost of electricity from different sources is notoriously open to manipulation. But even Nuclear Electric quotes the unit price from Sizewell on completion in 1994 as 5.2p, compared with 2.9p from a new gas-fired station. 'The economics (of nuclear power) in the long term will be compelling. The problem is how to get through a rather difficult four to five years,' Collier says. The industry is pinning much of its hopes on public concern about global warming. For once, nuclear power is squeaky clean on an environmental issue; Industry executives believe that global warming will force governments to boost the price of fossil fuels through carbon taxes, thereby improving nuclear power's competitiveness. Meanwhile, Nuclear Electric is preparing for the promised 1994 review. Demonstrating that it can complete Sizewell to time and cost will be crucial. But more important still will be the outcome of the next general election. Conservative ministers have all but prejudged the review by stressing their strong support for nuclear power; the Labour party is much more iffy.</p>

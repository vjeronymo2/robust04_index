The Commission also seeks comment on its tentative conclusion that the 80 non-contiguous SMR channels should be licensed on a local basis. The Commission seeks comment on whether dividing the 800 MHz band spectrum in this fashion is fair and equitable and also solicits alternative allocations that would fairly balance the interests of wide-area and local SMR systems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The Commission proposes to divide the upper 10 MHz ``MTA block'' into four blocks of 2.5 MHz, corresponding to 50 channels per block under our existing frequency allocation rules. The Commission seeks comment on whether the proposed allocation is a fair division of channels within the MTA and will lead to efficient spectrum use and the appropriateness of alternative block sizes both smaller and larger than 2.5 MHz. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. In addition, the Commission tentatively concludes that a limit on the aggregation of 800 MHz SMR spectrum by a single licensee within a particular MTA is unnecessary. The Commission previously concluded that 45 MHz cap on aggregation of broadband PCS, cellular, and SMR spectrum, combined with existing service-specific caps for cellular and PCS, was sufficient to maintain a competitive commercial mobile radio service market. The Commission nonetheless seeks comment on whether there should be such an aggregation limit for 800 MHz SMR. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The Commission further propose to continue licensing SMR systems on the ``lower 80'' channels on a local basis in order to provide opportunities for SMR operators who seek to provide local service. The Commission solicits comment on two alternative approaches to local SMR licensing. The first alternative would be to continue licensing these channels under the same geographic separation and channelization criteria that exist in the Commission's current SMR rules. The second alternative would be to discontinue site-specific licensing and instead offer licenses for individual channels or small channel blocks covering defined geographic areas. The Commission also seeks comment on any possible licensing alternatives for the ``lower 80'' channels that might further promote the SMR operators' ability to quickly gain access to spectrum and to provide efficient service to the public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The Commission also proposes that MTA licensees will be entitled to use any available border area channels within their spectrum blocks, subject to the relevant rules regarding international assignment and coordination of such channels. The Commission seeks comment on this proposal and on how to license the channels in border areas that are not contained in the proposed MTA block, which include both lower 80 SMR channels and channels that are allocated to non-SMR services outside the border areas. The Commission proposes to license these channels on a channel-by-channel basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. The Commission believes that a key element in any new licensing scheme for wide-area SMR sytems is that licensees be extended the same flexibility, to the extent feasible, as cellular and PCS licensees in terms of the location, design, construction, and modification of their facilities throughout their service area. Thus, the Commission tentatively concludes that MTA licensees in the 800 MHz band should be authorized to construct stations at any available site and on any available channel within their MTAs (subject to their obligation to provide co-channel protection to incumbents as discussed  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> infra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). It also proposes to allow MTA licensees to add, subtract, move, and otherwise modify their base station facilities without any need for prior Commission consent, provided they notify the Commission of the coordinates and certify compliance with other applicable FCC technical requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. The Commission proposes that if an incumbent fails to construct, discontinues operations, or otherwise has its license terminated by the Commission, the spectrum covered by that incumbent's authorization should automatically revert to the MTA licensee who has obtained the contingent rights to that spectrum. An additional proposal is that the MTA license confer the right to negotiate with incumbent systems within the MTA to purchase or relocate their facilities. In this regard, the Commission proposes that any request for transfer or assignment of an incumbent authorization to the MTA licensee be presumptively considered in the public interest. The Commission seeks comment on these proposals and other alternatives, including the costs and benefits associated with each alternative in markets that are heavily occupied by incumbent licensees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. The commission tentatively concludes that incumbent SMR systems should not be required to relocate new frequencies, but that decisions regarding relocation should instead be left to the parties involved and the marketplace. Thus, it asks commenters to address: (a) whether relying on voluntary negotiations between MTA licensees and incumbents will continue to provide sufficient inducement for incumbents to relocate; (b) whether the Commission should intervene if incumbents refuse ``reasonable'' inducements to relocate; and, (c) what constitutes a ``reasonable'' inducement and the specific form of intervention, if any, that should be taken by the Commission in those instances when the incumbent has refused such inducements. The Commission also seeks further comment on mandatory relocation as an alternative to voluntary arrangements between MTA licensees and incumbents similar to the Commission's provisions for relocation of microwave licensees from the 2 GHz PCS band. In addition, the Commission solicits comment on possible mechanisms for ensuring that all relocation costs to incumbents would be guaranteed by the MTA licensee, descriptions of specific costs, both direct and indirect, that would be associated with relocation (including whether they should be fully reimbursable by the MTA licensee), and whether MTA licensees should be required to offer some form of premium over cost ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  additional channels or improved facilities) if they seek to invoke a mandatory relocation option. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Also, the Commission tentatively concludes that incumbent systems should not be allowed to expand beyond their existing service areas on MTA-licensed channels without the consent of the MTA licensee. The Commission also proposes to allow incumbent licenses to freely modify their facilities provided such modifications do not expand their service areas. The Further Notice requests comment regarding the advantages and disadvantages of these proposals and specific examples of circumstances under which incumbents should be permitted to modify their systems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

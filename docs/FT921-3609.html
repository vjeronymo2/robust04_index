			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: CBOT to acquire broker THE CHICAGO Board of Trade (CBOT), the world's largest futures exchange, said its Ceres Trading Limited Partnership had signed a letter of intent to acquire EJV Brokerage, an electronic interdealer broker of US government securities, writes Barbara Durr. The acquisition would give CBOT members direct access to the cash market for US government securities for the first time. EJV Brokerage is a wholly owned subsidiary of EJV Partners, a joint venture among affiliates of the leading primary dealers - Citibank, First Boston, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Salomon Brothers. The CBOT, which lists the US Treasury bond futures, is general partner of Ceres Trading. The EJV Brokerage, operational since last May, will permit CBOT members and member-firms to make bids and offers as well as accept bids and offers of primary dealers on the electronic system. It has 170 terminals in place on 35 primary dealer trading desks in New York, Chicago and San Francisco. The network would be augmented with stations at locations selected by CBOT members. Any profits would accrue to the Ceres Trading Partnership and thus to CBOT members, said Mr William O'Conner, CBOT chairman.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 7 (XINHUA) -- All parties concerned  should, in the current situation, avoid taking actions that will  sharpen the contradictions in the Korean Peninsula, a Chinese  Foreign Ministry spokesman said here today.    Spokesman Wu Jianmin told the weekly press conference that  the maintenance of relaxation and stability of the Korean  Peninsula conforms to the common interests of both the Korean  people and all other parties concerned.    Wu said that China opposes any action harmful to the  relaxation and stability in the Korean Peninsula, be it military  exercises or deployment of missiles.    Wu said that all parties concerned should refrain from  taking  actions that would sharpen the contradictions in the Korean  Peninsula, especially under the current circumstances.    He made the statement when asked to comment on the fact that  the United States has begun shipping "Patriot" missiles to the  Republic of Korea (ROK) and that the United States and the  republic of Korea are planning to resume their Team-Spirit joint  military exercises.    Wu also reiterated China's stand that the nuclear inspection  issue should be settled through dialogue.</p>

			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> PERFORMANCES AN OPINIONATED GUIDE  </P> <P> THURSDAY  </P> <P> *Something For Nothing (Charlie's, 362 California St., Ventura, 648-6688)  Hard-edged rock 'n' roll, meaner than your mother-in-law. New tape on the way.  </P> <P> *Tom Ball &amp; Kenny Sultan (The Grill, 1279 Coast Village Road, Montecito,  969-5969) Rollicking acoustic blues duo that unearths and resurrects classic  tunes that are older than you are. They have five albums.  </P> <P> *Leo Downey Band (The Ketch, 514 State St., Santa Barbara, 564-3231) All  original rock by this popular local rock god/guitarist making for the happening  Thursday night party.  </P> <P> *Pat, Fin &amp; Greg (Alex's Cantina, 633 State St., Santa Barbara, 966-0032)  The other happening party on State Street by these folk-rock troubadours who  know about 1,000 songs and can sing better than almost everybody. They've been  doing this gig every Thursday for three years -- I'll bet they show up.  </P> <P> *Life Talking, Remission (Carnaval Club, 634 State St., Santa Barbara,  965-8422) Life Talking will probably be Life Singing since this is their record  release party.  </P> <P> *One Love Vibration (Alex's Cantina, 5918 Hollister Ave., Goleta, 683-2577)  Yup, there are two Alex's but only One Love Vibration, doing rockin' reggae,  mon.  </P> <P> FRIDAY  </P> <P> *Rob Rio &amp; The Revolvers (Oxnard Community Center, 351 South B St., Oxnard,  487-5351) The King of the Boogie Woogie Piano brings his infectious dance music  to the city that's more than just a pretty name.  </P> <P> *One Love Vibration (Charlie's) Yup, it's them again.  </P> <P> Leo Downey Band (Fess Parker's Red Lion Resort, 630 E. Cabrillo Ave., Santa  Barbara, 564-4333) So do you think Fess will get up and sing some Davy Crockett  songs with Leo, the man who never takes a day off? Nah . . .  </P> <P> *Crucial DBC (Alex's Cantina, Santa Barbara) Santa Barbara reggae monsters  compete for the Friday night State Street crowd.  </P> <P> SATURDAY  </P> <P> *Toad The Wet Sprocket, Spencer The Gardener, The I-Rails, The Mudheads (Alex's  Cantina, Santa Barbara) It's a powerhouse lineup of local talent performing a  bass-a-thon benefit. No, not the ale or the fish. All proceeds from the door go  toward replacing the bass guitar recently ripped off from the I-Rails' bassist  and singer, Chris O'Connor, by some lowdown, rotten weasel. By the way, the  I-Rails' fourth tape is great.  </P> <P> *Tempting Souls (Charlie's) Horns, horns and more horns do Motown and classic  R&amp;B at the beach.  </P> <P> *Leo Downey Band, Michael On Fire (Fess Parker's Red Lion Resort) A few weeks  ago Leo caught a Michael On Fire gig at Joseppi's, then Leo caught fire. And  now Michael is opening for Leo, making for musical pyrotechnics that may  require asbestos underwear. They're going to play separately, then jam  together. Also on the bill is harmonica god Lee Oskar.  </P> <P> SUNDAY  </P> <P> *The Mudheads, Something For Nothing, The I-Rails, Expression (Ventura College,  Quad area) This 11 a.m. show is sort of an anti-war concert featuring four  excellent local bands plus some angry speakers of the "hell, no, we won't go"  persuasion.  </P> <P> *Matt Schulte &amp; Bill Coffey (Charlie's) Two super-duper folk singers who  harmonize like nobody's business or the Everly Brothers.  </P> <P> *Bruce Hornsby &amp; The Range (Ventura Concert Theatre, 26 S. Chestnut St.,  Ventura) It's mellow and insightful piano rock by the two-time Grammy award  winner doing 8 and 10 p.m. shows.  </P> <P> MONDAY  </P> <P> *Mosaic (Charlie's) Real tight folk rock by Evans &amp; Van Loan plus their  backing band.  </P> <P> *The Pontiax (Alexander's, 1050 Schooner Drive, Ventura, 658-2000) Excellent,  veteran local blues band with a new tape and lots of fans.  </P> <P> *Pat, Fin &amp; Greg (The Grill) Again.  </P> <P> TUESDAY  </P> <P> *Official Resistance (Charlie's) They're loud; they're angry; they have cute  girlfriends. Here they are.  </P> <P> WEDNESDAY  </P> <P> *Ariel (Charlie's) Original rock band from Ventura that's about to become the  next local signing, or so they say -- but you know how optimistic these  rock-and-rollers can be. But still, they have some spiffy one-of-a-kind tunes.  Check 'em out.  </P> <P> *The Pontiax (Alex's Cantina, S.B.) Blues before the home folks.  </P> <P>  Yup, it's only rock 'n' roll and thus these listings are subject to change.  Mom was right -- call first.  </P> <P> BILL LOCEY  </P></p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / BSkyB claims trading profit for first time: The sharp turnround at the satellite television company BRITISH SKY Broadcasting, the six-channel satellite television company, yesterday celebrated a symbolic turning point - its first modest trading profit ahead of schedule. In March, the satellite company said it would have weekly film subscription revenues of Pounds 3.8m plus Pounds 1m from advertising and other sources. Programme costs and overheads would total Pounds 4.7m a week leaving a weekly operating profit of Pounds 100,000. This is in stark contrast with 16 months ago when British Satellite Broadcasting and Sky Television merged. Total weekly income then was Pounds 1.6m and with total costs of Pounds 11.6m this left a weekly operating loss of Pounds 10m. 'In my view both would have failed if there had not been a merger,' Mr Frank Barlow, chairman of BSkyB and managing director of Pearson, owners of the Financial Times, said yesterday. The main shareholders - Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International, Granada, the television and leisure group, Pearson, and Chargeurs, the French transport and communications company - will be very relieved that the flow of money out of the company has halted and the first trickle of money is flowing in the other direction. However, yesterday's presentation does not mean that one of the world's most expensive television ventures is home and dry. The company has guaranteed bank facilities of Pounds 420m and Pounds 860m in loan stock. When the Pounds 240m equity money is included, a financial structure of Pounds 1.52bn has been created to carry the system to operating break even point. Interest charges paid to the shareholders on the debt are running at Pounds 2.8m a week. No-one at the company, which operates as Sky Television, would predict when the venture might reach overall profit. Film deals have been agreed for 10-year periods with the seven leading Hollywood studios. It was claimed that this extension of the original deal would save Dollars 100m (Pounds 58m) in payments between 1995 and 2000. The financial future of BSkyB depends on two rising trends - the number of homes receiving satellite television in the UK and a rising proportion within that group paying Pounds 16.99 a month to receive both Sky subscription channels. By the end of January, 2.87m homes in the UK had satellite television via dishes and cable television. In the last week of February, 26,200 dishes were sold or rented because of the exclusive World Cup cricket coverage. The total represents 13 per cent of UK television homes. Mr Gary Davey, deputy managing director, said because of the 'young, middle-market family' nature of satellite homes, Sky accounted for 17 per cent of the population, 21 per cent of 16-34 year-olds and 23 per cent of 4-15 year-olds. The trends on subscription revenues seem to be going Sky's way. Last July, there was a total of 987,000 film subscribers but only 51 per cent took both film channels. By the end of the year, when the total number of subscribers had grown to 1.15m, the percentage taking the more expensive package had grown to 70 per cent. In January, 42,000 dishes were sold in retail outlets and 32,000 agreed to pay for at least one film channel. Of that number, 28,600 or 90 per cent took the second film channel. Two large questions have to be answered before BSkyB can celebrate. The first is whether, as some forecasts suggest, 50 per cent of UK homes will have satellite television by 2001 and how high the programme costs will be. The second, which applies mainly to Mr Murdoch, is what happens if a Labour government is elected. Labour is committed to investigating cross-media ownership. Mr Robin Corbett, Labour's broadcasting spokesman, said Mr Murdoch would be given the choice of taking his 50 per cent holding in BSkyB down to 20 per cent or giving up his control of News International.  -------------------------------------------------------------            COMPARISON OF WEEKLY TRADING RESULTS  -------------------------------------------------------------                                         Nov           Mar                                        1990          1992  ------------------------------------------------------------- Subscription revenue            Pounds  1.2m   Pounds 3.8m Advertising &amp; other revenue     Pounds  0.4m   Pounds 1.0m Total income                    Pounds  1.6m   Pounds 4.8m Programming costs               Pounds  5.1m   Pounds 2.9m Overhead                        Pounds  6.5m   Pounds 1.8m Total costs                     Pounds 11.6m   Pounds 4.7m Weekly operating profit/(loss) (Pounds 10.0m)  Pounds 0.1m  -------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Brazil in final thanks to Romario Brazil's 24-year wait for a place in the World Cup final ended yesterday when they beat Sweden 1-0 in the Pasadena Rose Bowl to set up a rematch of the 1970 final in Mexico against Italy, when a Pele-inspired Brazil won 4-1. Barcelona striker Romario headed home the only goal ten minutes from the end after Brazil had dominated much of the match, only to be frustrated by some inspired goalkeeping by Thomas Ravelli, but more by their own inability to finish countless chances. Romario should have put Brazil ahead in the 26th minute after Branco's through ball split the Swedish defence, but the attacker waited too long to shoot and Patrik Andersson scrambled the ball off the goalline. Mazinho then smashed the rebound into the side netting. Bebeto sent Romario clear with a brilliant flick 7 minutes later but he stumbled over the ball, allowed Ravelli to head him off and shot into the side of the net. Sweden created very few chances in the first half, seemingly content to rely on long, high balls, which were largely ineffective. The Swedes, trying to get to the final for the first time since Brazil beat them in 1958, had their captain Jonas Thern sent off in the 63rd minute for a bad challenge on Dunga. The ten men defended well and looked for a break from set-pieces, but the Brazilian forwards wore them down and Romario's fifth goal of the tournament deflated the Scandinavians. In Sunday's final, both Italy and Brazil will be going for a record fourth World Cup title. Of the two, Italy was last to win it in 1982.

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Motoring: Big car, bigger bumps DIRECTORS and senior managers not only drive bigger and better company cars than the troops in their Escorts and Cavaliers; their accidents are bigger and costlier and, alarmingly, more frequent, too. According to a survey, the MD in his Pounds 25,000-plus car has an accident costing an average Pounds 914 to repair every 9,500 business driving miles (15,300 km) compared with sales executives (12,000 miles/19,300 km and Pounds 445) and office-bound staff (15,000 miles/24,150 km and Pounds 511). Lack of concentration and faulty judgment caused by stress and tiredness are blamed by Fleet Management Services for the top managers' failings. It analysed two years of insurance claims on the thousands of cars it provides for companies. A rhetorical question, really, because of course they should. But the easier cars become to drive, the less attention busy, perhaps preoccupied people, feel they need give them. Driving may be an essential chore to many of us but, if it is to be safe and accident-free, it is still a craft. If only the techniques taught by bodies such as the Institute of Advanced Motorists could be put into practice. This would do more to make driving safe for all road users - not least pedestrians - and slow the rise in insurance premiums than all the high technology built-into the modern car. It is a question of attitude. Every driver, whether top executive or financially hard-pressed family man, has to share the highway with millions of other people. Ideally, this would imply general observance of laws which exist for the general good. But does it? Let us take insurance, which is exclusively a problem for the non-company car driver. Protection agains third party claims has long been compulsory. Years ago, when motoring was still a minority activity, the courts used to be very tough on people who drove uninsured cars. The penalty was disqualification. And if a disqualified motorist put two fingers up to the law and carried on driving, he went to prison if caught. There was no argument. A few weeks inside was as automatic a penalty as disqualification is today for drink driving. Understandably, 30 years or so ago very few people risked driving without insurance or when disqualified. Compare the situation today. Driving an untaxed, uninsured car that could be dangerously unfit because it has not had an MoT examination is seen by many a motorist (including quite a few who have lost their licences anyway) as a cheap alternative to buying insurance. The Association of British Insurers reckons about 5 per cent of vehicles - that means more than 1m cars, vans and lorries - on British roads are currently uninsured. Officialdom seems to look the other way. How many new age travellers tax, insure and submit their vehicles for inspection; and how many even have driving licences? Who cares? Yet a collision with an uninsured vehicle can be financially unpleasant for the innocent party. Like Paul Mitchell, of Coleford, Gloucestershire, who was waiting to enter a roundabout when his car was struck from behind. Writing to Care on the Road, a journal of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, Mitchell said he was comprehensively insured and stood to lose some of his no-claims discount. The other driver, unlicenced as well as uninsured, was taken to court, given 13 penalty points on his non-existent licence and fined Pounds 60 under the discredited means-related scheme. 'Effectively, he got off scot free,' said a predictably peeved Mitchell. Am I alone in thinking this rather disgraceful? If uninsured, unlicenced driving, and driving while disqualified, really are seriously anti-social offences, what about changing the law to allow courts to seize and sell offenders' cars? Does anyone agree? ***** The biennial motoringfest at Earls Court is no longer Motorfair but the London Motor Show. It has been taken under the wing of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which also runs the British International Motor Show at the National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham. London Motor Show, which opens next Thursday for a public preview day and closes on Sunday week, will alternate with the Birmingham event. Unfortunately, it clashes this time with the Tokyo Motor Show, which will steal some of its thunder. Also, a number of the new-to-Britain exhibits will already have been seen at the Frankfurt Show in September. But never mind. There will be something for everyone interested in cars at Earls Court, which has been transformed from a gloomy old arena guarded by fierce ex-drill sergeant commissionaires into a modern exhibition hall. Admission is Pounds 12 on preview day (October 21), Pounds 7.50 on all other days (Pounds 5 after 5 pm). There are parking spaces for 1,800 cars on site at Pounds 1.50 an hour, Pounds 10 a day if booked in advance (tel: 071-370-8390) or Pounds 15 overnight. Visitors, say the show organisers, are advised to travel by Tube.</p>

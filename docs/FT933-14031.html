			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Birt admits BBC morale is low MR JOHN BIRT, BBC director-general, admitted yesterday that staff morale was low. The most difficult task management faced was to unite staff behind the painful structural reforms being pushed through, he said. Mr Birt has said that he expects staff questionnaires, published today, to make painful reading. It is believed the questionnaires show considerable staff loyalty to the BBC, but much greater criticism of senior management.</p>

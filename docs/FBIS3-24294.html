			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Fadin: "Argument of Pragmatists and </F> Restorers: About Who Would Best Reintegrate the Former Union"]    [Text] Whereas for Gorbachev domestic policy was to a  certain extent merely a part of his foreign policy, for Yeltsin  it has of a particular moment been to some extent the reverse:  Foreign policy has become a most important object of domestic  political struggle.    The treaty with Georgia, the policy of restoration of the  presence in the Balkans in the Bosnian crisis, the agreements  with Belarus and Moldova--these are merely recent events that  have been at the center of the political skirmishing. The harsh  criticism of the government's steps on the part of a certain  section of public opinion and the deputies might appear somewhat  inappropriate, possibly, but only outside of the context of the  actual struggle for power. After all, from the viewpoint of  basic values and orientations the foreign policy of the  "collective Yeltsin," in the "near abroad," at least, is hardly  much different from the growing imperial mood of the Russian  political class.    It needs to be clearly specified that we employ in this case  the term "imperialism" and all that derives from it in a  nonevaluative, "technical" sense--as a description of some  complex reality of the hierarchical coexistence of ethno-state  formations. In the particular sense (our short post-Soviet  history affords ponderable grounds for this) that "empire means  peace," and the "imperial" principle is objectively opposed to  nationalism and signifies, at least, the preponderance of  "nationalism of the soil" over "nationalism of blood." On the  other hand, any pursuit of "national" (that is, state) interests  by a great power inevitably incorporates such elements of the  imperial principle as sphere of influence, sphere of special  interests, and so forth. The great contemporary democracy, the  United States, demonstrates a rational imperial policy in this  sense.    In this sense the statement of service of neoimperial  achievements of the regime is relatively impressive. Real  military control over practically the entire territory of the  former USSR has been preserved--in the sense that in no republic  (the Baltic republics included) are there any foreign forces or  military facilities other than Russian. The war in Tajikistan,  the indefinite billeting of the 14th Army in the Dniester  region, the presence of military bases in the Caucasus enshrined  by agreements, the retention of the Black Sea Fleet,  preservation of the nuclear monopoly on one-sixth of terra firma  and military facilities and forces in the Baltic, real military  control of the situation along the CIS perimeter, and pressure  on its post-Soviet neighbors, increasingly effective on the  whole, in favor of the introduction of dual citizenship--"what  more do you want?"    The list could be continued, but even without this the story  that Yeltsin is an agent inserted by the Politburo into the  democratic movement for restoration of the USSR, which even  recently seemed paradoxical, is becoming increasingly  understandable.    The difference here between the positions of the "collective  Yeltsin" and the opposition (if the Duma majority may be so  called) remains fundamental. Whereas the opposition is oriented,  in fact, toward the simple retention of the territories of the  former empire (and in the unrealizable maximum, toward its  restoration), the policy of the Yeltsin leadership is perfectly  manifestly aimed at the neoimperial modernization of Russia's  sphere of influence in the former USSR and contiguous countries,  within the bounds of the objectively constricted possibilities  of the present Russia, what is more.    If we are truly now observing the birth of Russian  neoimperialism, a modernization of the sphere of Russia's  interests in this logic would not signify either a restoration  of the Soviet Union or an assembly of lands in the spirit of  Ivan III. The "neo" suffix could mean primarily that influence  should extend merely to the sphere of Russia's actual  interests--military-political control, maintenance of the  stability of interethnic relations, control over the main  mineral resources, guardianship of local Russians, and so forth.    At the same time, on the other hand, this control would not  entail the restoration either of the unity of the legal space or  control over the extent of the powers of the local ruling elites  or Moscow's former responsibility for maintaining a living  standard in Uzbekistan, an infant-mortality rate in Azerbaijan  or an educational level in Tajikistan somehow on a par with  Russia.    Reality, however, is immeasurably more complex than our  plans. The neoimperial trends in the policy of the Russian  leadership are being manifested as a dotted line, residing  alongside perfectly traditional approaches, which is strictly  conditioned both by the pressure of the current crisis and the  actual composition of the governing coalition.    The victory of the traditional industrial establishment in  the government has afforded its leader, Oleg Soskovets, an  opportunity to busy himself with restoration of the production  engineering chains of Soviet industry currently severed among  different states. The latter will be possible only with the  restoration of the chains of the series of payments for orders,  which have been severed today even more hopelessly than the  production engineering chains, which, of course, is not so much  an economic as a political matter--the main grounds for  reconstitution of the ruble zone.    On the other hand, certain steps of the regime which seemed  purely political (and even ideologically conditioned) have upon  closer inspection an entirely material motivation. Participation  in the civil war in Tajikistan is not simply a war for control  over territory of the former USSR but also an aspiration to plug  a hole on the border, the existence of which would require far  greater outlays on the reconstitution of a nontransparent  Russian border proper, and Tajikistan's admittance to the ruble  space is the actual charge for this. And so forth.    Let us not forget either the interests of Russian big  business, the "sharks" of which have learned to defend their  interests with the cudgel of the Russian Government. The  Azerbaijani Government had only to attempt to organize a  consortium for the development of oil deposits without the  participation of Russian corporations for the Karabakh army to  tear toward the Iranian border, occupying a further two areas of  the country. The Lukoyl concern had to be urgently included in  the consortium, after which the Azerbaijani Army was able to  restore the lost territories in the course of a  counteroffensive....    On the other hand, the motives of the regime's active policy  in the near abroad are partially, truly, of the nature of a  reaction to intra-Russian circumstances. The ideological vacuum  in which the regime has found itself following the exhaustion of  the potential of the liberal-market utopia is forcing it to seek  ideological support in the deep-lying seams of the mass  consciousness, which is in Russia imperial by nature.  Essentially, under the conditions of the continuing unfolding of  the economic crisis, only opposition to some external enemy can  secure for Yeltsin powerful mass support within the country on  the eve of presidential elections.    In turn, it is just as necessary for the opposition to  portray Yeltsin's foreign policy as insufficiently imperial,  capitulationist, ideally. In the political struggle the  arguments are directed not toward the opposite side but toward  the public--and are not, therefore, required to be just. A  deplorable illustration of this trivial observation were the  closed hearings in the Duma CIS Committee devoted to the treaty  with Georgia which had been signed not long before this.    B. Pastukhov, deputy minister of foreign affairs, and  representatives of other government departments, who presented  the treaty in the committee, attempted to show that the treaty  was in Russia's strategic interests, that Russia's departure  from Georgia would signify the filling of the vacated niche by  other powers, and that support for Shevardnadze was the best  decision for Russia at this time.    But the deputies' criticism of the treaty was of a clearly  anti-Yeltsin and, consequently, anti-Georgian nature.  Accusations against the Georgian (!) side that it had violated  the Sochi agreements and had endeavored to obtain Russian  weapons to threaten its neighbors were heard. It was proposed  that Russia not guarantee Georgia's integrity but act as an  arbiter, as it were, between Tbilisi and the autonomies, that  is, de facto constantly keep its hand on the throat of the  Georgian state. The proposal for the drawing of a permanent line  of demarcation in South Ossetia along the line of the actual  control of the Russian forces (that is, de facto annexation of  part of the territory) was heard also.    It is not important who personally gave voice to these  sentiments--they are manifestly dominant in the political class  and in society. A sociological survey of the Public Opinion  Foundation on the attitude toward Belarus's affiliation to the  ruble zone showed that a substantial portion of the Russian  population is prepared to forgo to some extent its own living  standard even for the sake of preserving a unified post-Soviet  space.    Criticism of the policy of the regime in the "near abroad"  remains, in fact, within the framework of values common to both  those doing the criticizing and the criticized. It is more a  struggle between those nostalgic for the irrevocable Soviet  times of Moscow's full control over the republics and those  who--intuitively, perhaps--are attempting to operate within the  framework of the new sociopolitical and geopolitical realities.</p>

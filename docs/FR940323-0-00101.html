			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Without additional information about the frequency of use of within-area and out-of-area schools, it is not appropriate to include post-high school education expense in the COLA model. In the employee survey, OPM asked employees several questions about college and university usage. OPM plans to use the results of the employee survey to review the issue of post-high school education. OPM is also researching the cost of within-area and out-of-area tuition, books, room and board, transportation, and related expenses. OPM plans to include the results of this research and the employee survey in its report to Congress. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters questioned whether Runzheimer's survey adequately covered childcare expenses. An employee from Alaska stated that her childcare costs were high and accounted for a large percentage of her total budget. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two kinds of childcare are included in the survey_day care and babysitting. Runzheimer prices the monthly cost of professional day care services (eight hours a day, five days a week). Runzheimer also obtains the price of casual babysitting services. Both are assigned appropriate weights based on the CES and are used in the COLA model. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on the Housing Component <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters objected to trimming the high and low values in the housing component. The commenters believed that housing market price anomalies should be tolerated or that another approach should be used to reduce these anomalies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As was stated in the report, the purpose of trimming was to stabilize the housing data from one year to the next. Trimming is essentially a nonparametric technique, similar to using the median rather than the average. OPM and Runzheimer considered using the median but rejected it because the limited number of observations obtained in some smaller allowance areas could cause the median to be erratic from one year to the next. Runzheimer recommended trimming as an alternative to the median, and OPM agreed. Trimming provides stability; and because equal numbers of high and low values are trimmed, no bias is introduced. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter objected to the comparison of new and older home prices combined. He felt that the survey should compare the prices of homes of a similar age as well as a similar size and room count. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Numerous factors influence rents and selling prices. Information on some of these factors is readily available, but much of it is not. Runzheimer uses home size and room count as the major criteria in housing comparisons because these factors generally have the most influence on housing costs. Age is not used because it frequently is not available and probably has less influence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter from Alaska noted the high cost of her new home in Alaska. She also said that the cost of drilling a deep well significantly increased the cost of her new home. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Runzheimer surveys the selling price of homes that sold during the 6 month period prior to the survey. The selling price generally reflects the cost of construction, including the cost of appurtenances such as water wells. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stated that the residential areas surveyed on Oahu did not properly reflect where Federal employees live nor the income levels that Runzheimer associated with the communities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OPM recognizes that community selection is an important part of the COLA survey. The communities surveyed in Hawaii were changed in response to comments OPM received on earlier surveys. Additional changes may be warranted. OPM plans to use the results of the employee survey to review community selection and make appropriate changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter from Alaska stated that the cost of utilities was high and provided examples of her utility costs. She also stated that utility costs vary with the size of the home. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Runzheimer included in the COLA surveys the cost of utilities. The average costs for Owners and Renters for each area were shown in Appendix 7 of the report and were part of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice. As shown in the appendix, the cost of utilities is the second highest cost of housing, exceeded only by the cost of mortgage payments or rent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The COLA model takes into account that utility costs vary with home size. Section 4.2.4.1 of the report described the process used and the factors that were applied. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stated that the survey failed to take into consideration the use of solar water heaters in Hawaii and Guam. The commenter believed that the model did not account for the capital cost of such heaters nor the possible reduction in overall utility consumption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, significant home features and improvements generally are reflected in the selling price of the home. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, OPM's living cost surveys will reflect the cost of solar water heaters to the extent that such items influence home market values and are commonly found on homes in any area, including Hawaii and Guam. If the use of solar water heaters is so common that it generally reduces the consumption of utilities, this too will be reflected in the survey results. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

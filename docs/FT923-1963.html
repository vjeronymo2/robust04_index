			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Sport: Essex man triumphant - Cricket I MEAN no insult to Essex if I say that in some ways the bottom of this year's Britannic Assurance Championship is more interesting than the top. It is more surprising. Whereas most people expected Essex to repeat last year's success and emerge as county champions, few expected Durham to fail as resoundingly as they have done in their opening season as a first class county. Durham entered the fray full of sound and fury, signifying everything from the neglected north to the ageing celebrity. They have ended the season in last place, winners of only two of their 22 games. With many players recruited from other counties, Durham will need a lot of practice before they work well as a team. David Graveney has not found it easy to lead the pugnacious Australian, Dean Jones, Ian Botham and Wayne Larkins, once muscle-man of Northamptonshire's batting, in harmony with Durham's other acquisitions and with its young hopefuls, such as batsmen Stewart Hutton and John Glendenen. Hutton and Glendenen notwithstanding, Durham scored fewer batting points than any other county. Their bowling lacked speed and suffered from a surfeit of tired medium pace. Durham's lovely grounds, such as the University one, under the cathedral's majestic eye, will doubtless produce lovely county cricket as they grow into true county grounds. In the meantime it is hard not to feel a twinge of hope that local talent will play a stronger part next year, in preference to all Durham's famous refugees. It would be unrealistic to pretend that county cricket is anything other than an exchange market nowadays. With Yorkshire going the way of all others, the home grown has lost its last battle with the free range. But that does not mean that the market system is unquestionably the most profitable one. This season has shown the value of a stable element, or at least the danger of always preferring innovation to stability. At Chelmsford they are in no doubt that staying power and steady leadership are crucial. 'Cricket is like an elongated game of chess,' a club spokesman told me with satisfaction, trying to pick out one strength above another in the abundance of Essex's riches. 'It's not like football, all over in a couple of hours. There's much more for a captain to do: boosting morale, making tactical decisions, making plans. The captain leads the team. We keep ours a long time - Graham Gooch now; Keith Fletcher for 12 years before him.' Essex have a tradition of loyalty from their players and boast of the way foreign signings, even potentially difficult ones like Salim Malik last year, come back for another spell. Chelmsford, Ilford, Southend and Colchester do not nourish prima donnas. Essex's recent triumph in the county championship continues to boost their confidence, which improves their play. Essex's loss of their best batsmen, Gooch and Salim, to the Anglo-Pakistani battlefield did not have a purely negative effect. 'It's been more of a team effort this year.' Team effort has been a key to this year's county championship. John Stephenson has flourished with the bat. Although Essex's highest bowler in the averages is only 17th (Derek Pringle), they have kept each other going. Peter Such, 19th in the averages, is taking over from veteran off-spinner John Childs as one of the team's assets. Several other counties have done well with their slow bowlers. Hampshire have used Shaun Udal's off-spin cleverly. The same is true of Sussex with Ian Salisbury's leg-spin and Kent with Richard Davis's slow left-armers, with which he has taken 74 wickets. Now Somerset have nabbed Mushtaq Ahmed, Pakistan's globular and aerodynamic wrist spinner, as their 1993 foreign signing. Mushtaq is a welcome acquisition, a symbol of encouragement for spinners and those who relish their arts. Spin is one of the tools Leicestershire did not use in their recovery this year. They are an outstanding example of the sort of team effort Essex value so highly. Talent, in the person of Phil DeFreitas, David Gower and Chris Lewis deserted Leicestershire. Not surprisingly, spirits fell. The appointment of Australia's Bobby Simpson as cricket manager and resident tough guy in 1989 was a mistake. When he left last season, Leicestershire were next to bottom. This season they are eighth. Jackie Birkenshaw has replaced Simpson. Their captain Nigel Briers has led from the front, building solid opening partnerships with Tim Boon. What Boon and Briers have done to help improve Leicestershire after a strained period, Alan Fordham and Nigel Felton have done for Northamptonshire, up from tenth to third. This has been a prosperous year for journeyman counties like these, which lack stars but work hard with what they've got. If the arrival of four-day cricket has had any effect, I'm afraid it has slowed the game down even more and this has suited counties working their way along, with everyone making a small contribution. Only Derbyshire, ever individualistic, have used their fiery talent to blaze their own way, on and off, to another good year. Ian Bishop has joined Devon Malcolm and Dominic Cork in that county rarity: a real pace attack. Kim Barnett and the county's new Tigger, Chris Adams, have batted with flair and occasional brilliance. Were Derbyshire to develop a new, alien virtue of steadiness, they would soon be the best county in England. But one of the Derbyshire's qualities is that you never know. Nor do they.</p>

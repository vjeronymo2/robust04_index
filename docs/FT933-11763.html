			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tories see image boost in PM's strong words SENIOR TORY party figures insisted yesterday that the publication of full transcripts of private conversations in which Mr John Major swore and made derogatory remarks about colleagues would enhance his standing rather than damage it. There had been fears that Mr Major's remarks were so much at odds with the Conservatives' public calls for unity following the split within the party over Maastricht, that they would add to the impression of Tory disarray. But party officials said that telephone calls to Tory offices had been positive, as people welcomed Mr Major's readiness 'to face down rebels in his own party'. Sir Giles Shaw, a member of the executive of the influential 1922 Committee of Tory MPs, told BBC Radio: 'After one hell of a week, the prime minister has shown robust and pretty steely views and one must applaud him for that.' The toughness was also apparent in the withdrawal of the Tory party whip from Mr Rupert Allason, the MP for Torbay and the only Conservative not to support the government in last Friday's confidence vote. The particularly important role given to his local constituency association in determining his future career was spelt out in the letter to Mr Allason from Mr Richard Ryder, the government chief whip, which was published yesterday. It said: 'I have decided to suspend the whip from you until Nicholas Baker (Mr Allason's regional Commons whip) and your association chairman recommend your reinstatement after you have demonstrated clear and consistent support for the government.' Last night Torbay Conservative Association said after a meeting that Mr Allason would explain his actions to its executive council in September. There is no prospect of his rehabilitation before then. While the political excitement over Mr Major's comments showed signs of dying down, a fresh row was developing over related newspaper telephone lines. The Daily Mirror and The Sun advertised telephone numbers to enable people to hear the tapes of conversations they had published - the Daily Mirror the off-the-record conversation on Friday in which the prime minister spoke bitterly of the difficulties of managing with a small majority, and The Sun the private comments by Mr Major just before last year's election. The lines were yesterday banned by the telephone information services watchdog as 'an unreasonable invasion of privacy'. The companies running them were given 24 hours to justify the services.</p>

			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 17-YEAR-OLD CHARGED IN DEATHS OF 2 YOUNGSTERS;  </P> <P> VIOLENCE: JUVENILE ACCUSED IN SHOTGUN KILLINGS COULD BE SENT TO PRISON FOR LIFE  UNDER THE RECENTLY APPROVED PROPOSITION 115.  </P> <P> Charges of murder with special circumstances and attempted murder were filed  Tuesday against a 17-year-old youth accused of firing a shotgun into a weekend  birthday party in South-Central Los Angeles, killing a 6-year-old girl and  fatally wounding a 14-year-old boy who died Tuesday.  </P> <P> The decision to seek special circumstances of multiple murder is the first time  since Proposition 115 was approved in June that a juvenile defendant has been  charged in Los Angeles County under a provision that calls for life without  parole upon conviction, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district  attorney's office said.  </P> <P> The district attorney's office declined to identify the suspected gunman  because of his age. But Deputy Dist. Atty. Joe Markus, head of the Compton Hard  Core anti-gang unit, said authorities will seek to try the youth as an adult.  </P> <P> The teen-ager is scheduled to be arraigned today in Compton Juvenile Court.  </P> <P> Before Proposition 115 was approved, a juvenile could not be sentenced to  prison for life, without possibility of parole, even if convicted in a case  involving special circumstances, the spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> The events leading to the filing of Tuesday's charges unfolded Saturday night  when a gunman fired two shotgun blasts at party-goers in an apartment at 10500  S. Vermont Ave., killing Natalie Faine, fatally wounding Tyren Blow and grazing  the arm of an 11-year-old girl.  </P> <P> Tyren died Tuesday at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center where he had  been hospitalized with a head wound and placed on a respirator.  </P> <P> According to police, the gunman fired two shots toward a second-story balcony  outside the apartment where Norvelle and Ann Aldridge were celebrating the  birthdays of several relatives and hit the three children. Natalie had come  from her home in Pomona to attend the party.  </P> <P> About 20 minutes before the shooting, witnesses said, the gunman had kicked  Natalie, traded punches with her uncle, Norvelle Aldridge, and had been ordered  to leave.  </P> <P> The youth allegedly returned to the home and fired the fatal shots. Police  arrested him at his nearby home after the shooting.  </P></p>

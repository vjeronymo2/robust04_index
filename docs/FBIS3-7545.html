			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan-ROK Relationship Getting Onto Mature </F> Track"]    [Text] South Korean President Kim Yong-sam has concluded  his visit to Japan, and his visit must have left many people  with the impression that the environment surrounding Japan-ROK  relations has undergone a change.    This was the first visit to Japan as a state guest by a  South  Korean president in four years and the first time that the focus  of summit talks has not dwelled on the two nations' past  history. The mass media of both countries reported on the  summit and on the emperor's remarks in a calm manner.    It is true that his visit took place at a time when the  issue  of DPRK (North Korean) suspected nuclear weapons development has  become critical. However, it is believed that many Japanese and  South Koreans have begun to basically share President Kim's  view, which he expounded at the Imperial Palace banquet, that  "the past should no longer be allowed to obstruct the future."    Nothing is more futile than to allow the past to damage  present and future relations between Japan and the ROK. We want  to relegate to history that unhappy period when anti-Japanese  sentiment reared its ugly head in South Korea and Japan  continually expressed its exasperation with the South Koreans.    Needless to say, the Japanese people should not forget the  history and lessons connected with Japan's colonial rule of the  Korean peninsula. In regard to the comfort women issue, South  Korea has worked out its own relief measures without seeking  compensation from Japan. Separately from these measures, it is  now urgent for the Japanese Government to take actions to show  its sincerity in tackling the issue.    President Kim's current visit marked the first step toward  establishing a mature bilateral relationship. Now that it has  gotten on the future-oriented track, efforts should be made to  keep it on track.    On the basis of present and future interests, good relations  between Japan and the ROK are essential in regard to the  international situation. The two countries have many  interconnecting roles to play to ensure stability and  development in the Asia-Pacific region and in the world. North  Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development program is a case  in point in the immediate vicinity.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Kim agreed to  support the international community's resolute actions to settle  the issue while opening the door to dialogue with North Korea.  They also agreed to further strengthen tripartite cooperation  between Japan, South Korea, and the United States, while  confirming the importance of China's role and seeking its  cooperation.    The two leaders sent a signal to North Korea that they would  seek a solution through dialogue by urging the North to accept  the full inspection of its nuclear facilities and to promote a  dialogue between the two Koreas. But depending on the North's  response, they said they would endorse sanctions to be approved  by the UN Security Council.    Because the issue poses a serious security problem for Japan  and the ROK, this message is natural and reasonable. The UN  Security Council has decided to take graduated actions in  setting this issue. The Japanese coalition government--the  Social Democratic Party of Japan in particular--should make  efforts to tackle this issue with cohesion.    Reportedly, Prime Minister Hosokawa and President Kim  discussed all possible scenarios and agreed on how they would  react. However, it is necessary that the defense ministers of  the two countries get together to have a thorough discussion on  how to deal with the issue.    As President Kim told a news conference, it is apparent that  China is opposed to North Korea's nuclear weapons development  program. And, China will probably do its best to persuade the  DPRK not to go nuclear because China might find itself in a  difficult position when sanctions are discussed by the UN  Security Council. China certainly understands the significance  of President Kim's visit to Beijing in the footsteps of Prime  Minister Hosokawa.    We agree with President Kim when he said that isolating  North  Korea is not the intention of the international community and  that neither are sanctions. The international community just  wants North Korea to behave as a responsible member. We must  now keep a sharp eye on the DPRK.</p>

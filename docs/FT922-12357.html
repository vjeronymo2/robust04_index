			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Major will be urged to hold Scottish referendum LEADERS OF the Scottish Constitutional Convention are to call on Mr John Major, the prime minister, to hold a referendum on Scotland's future. The move, announced after yesterday's meeting of the convention's executive committee, follows the general election in which the Tories increased their total of Scottish seats to 11 while receiving 25 per cent of the vote north of the border. It comes less than a week after the Labour party in Scotland challenged Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, to hold such a referendum. Leaders of the convention, which includes Labour and the Liberal Democrats, will make fresh overtures to the Conservatives and the Scottish National party, both of which have boycotted the convention since it was founded in 1989. Canon Kenyon Wright, executive committee chairman, said the convention's model for a devolved parliament within the UK with limited tax-raising powers has been 'put on one side for a while'. Canon Wright suggested Mr Major's appointments to the Scottish Office indicated he was trying to be accommodating. What would most endanger the union would be an attitude that present constitutional rules were unbreakable, he said. Earlier, Sir David Steel, the former leader of the Liberal party, urged the government to consult other parties about holding a referendum, saying Mr Lang had not ruled this out. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, prepared the ground for restarting 'round-table' talks on the province's future yesterday with leaders of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party and the cross-community Alliance party. He will meet Irish ministers in the next two weeks, after which a gap in Anglo-Irish conferences is expected to be announced - paving the way for the resumption of the talks which were suspended before the UK general election. The Earl of Arran, formerly junior armed forces minister at the Ministry of Defence, is to become a junior minister at the Northern Ireland Office, it was announced yesterday. He is replaced at the ministry by former Tory MP Viscount Cranborne, who becomes a life peer. His appointment completes the prime minister's post-election ministerial shuffle. Mr Malcolm Bruce, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, is to stand down from the post. Nominations for the election of his successor close on May 15.</p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GALANTER GIVES SUPPORT TO LAKE  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter has bucked council tradition by  reaffirming her support for Laura M. Lake over Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky in  the 5th District race.  </P> <P> "I owe Laura personally and politically a great debt," Galanter said. Lake  played a key role in Galanter's successful campaign against Councilwoman Pat  Russell two years ago and took Galanter's mother into her home after Galanter  was stabbed by an intruder at her home during the 1987 campaign.  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky, who supported Russell two years ago, said of Galanter last week:  "I understand her personal relationship with Laura, and I respect it."  </P> <P> Galanter endorsed Lake, a fellow environmentalist, in September when  Yaroslavsky was expected to give up his council seat to run for mayor.  Yaroslavsky decided this month not to challenge Mayor Tom Bradley, citing polls  showing him to be unbeatable. Instead, he decided to seek reelection.  </P> <P> Also challenging Yaroslavsky in the April election are Jack McGrath, who  managed Yaroslavsky's first successful campaign in 1975 and served as the  councilman's chief deputy; urban planner Ryan Snyder and artist Henry Hill.  Steve Saltzman, a former Bradley aide and co-chairman of Yaroslavsky's 1985  reelection campaign, dropped out of the race.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MCKNIGHT IS SLIGHTED ONCE AGAIN;  </P> <P> LINEMAN FINDS HIMSELF AS SECOND-STRING CENTER AT CHARGERS' MINI-CAMP  </P> <P> After Dennis McKnight finished playing his high school football for the Wagner  High School Falcons in Staten Island (N.Y.), the college recruiters rewarded  him by offering no scholarships.  </P> <P> When McKnight became an honorable-mention All-American at Drake in 1980, the  National Football League recognized his achievement by ignoring him in its  draft.  </P> <P> Last year, McKnight started all 16 games at right guard for the Chargers and  became a Pro Bowl alternate when his peers voted him the seventh-best guard in  the American Football Conference.  </P> <P> So how did new Charger Coach Dan Henning's staff reward McKnight Monday at the  first day of the team's mini-camp at their practice facility at San Diego Jack  Murphy Stadium.  </P> <P> It made him a second-team center during the morning workout.  </P> <P> "Sure it bothered me," said McKnight, the team's freest spirit -- a guy with  tattoos on his arms, Harleys in his garage and a nasty gleam in his eye. "I got  bent all out of shape."  </P> <P> Monday was not a good day to be Dennis McKnight.  </P> <P> His teammates affectionately call him "Conan," as in "the Barbarian." Yet when  Henning was asked about McKnight after practice, he referred to him as  "Conehead."  </P> <P> Worse for McKnight, Henning said he knew about the Conan nickname and still  chose to call him Conehead.  </P> <P> Worse yet for McKnight, he finds himself competing at center with his best  friend on the team, veteran Don Macek, who was the starting center through the  first five games last season before injuring his shoulder and finishing out the  year on the injured reserve list. Don Rosado filled in at center for the  remainder of the season.  </P> <P> There might or might not be a happy ending to Monday's McKnightmare.  </P> <P> The Charger coaches say they will be experimenting with all their offensive  linemen during this five-day mini-camp.  </P> <P> "If Dennis feels demoted, he's wrong," said Larry Beightol, the team's new  offensive line coach.  </P> <P> But Beightol stopped short of feeling sorry for McKnight. "He's drumming all  this up in his own mind," Beightol said. "I have respect for what he did last  year. But that doesn't carry any water now. We've got a whole new staff here  and what we're trying to do is find at least five guys that we can win with and  start them."  </P> <P> Henning said McKnight could end up back at right guard. He also said McKnight  could move to left tackle.  </P> <P> McKnight said he'll go wherever they ask him to. "I'm used to adversity," he  said. "Right now, I think I'm classified as 'position pending.' "  </P> <P> Part of the problem is the Chargers are still looking for a left tackle. Gary  Kowalski and John Clay both started at that position last year before neck  injuries ended their seasons. Neither is ready to practice yet.  </P> <P> Henning said Macek will have to learn to play guard. He said overweight David  Richards, who started all 16 games at right tackle last year, also will have to  learn to play guard.  </P> <P> Charger Notes  </P> <P> Punter Ralf Mojsiejenko was the only Charger under contract to not show up for  the first day of mini-camp Monday. "I do not know why he is not here," said  Steve Ortmayer, director of football operations. "Although it has been  indicated to me that he has a problem with his contract. It's a contract that  we have been working on revisions for the last year or so." Ortmayer said Coach  Dan Henning would decide whether or not to fine Mojsiejenko. The mini-camp is  mandatory for players under contract. The maximum fine is $500 a day. . . .  Among the more prominent of the free-agent no-shows were running back Gary  Anderson and defensive lineman Joe Phillips. . . . Fifth-round rookie Elliott  Smith, a defensive back, sprained his ankle playing basketball after the draft  and is rehabilitating. . . . Wide receiver/kick returner Eric Yarber (knee) was  the only Charger to fail his physical exam Sunday. . . . The Chargers signed  defensive backs Leonard Coleman, a veteran backup, and rookie free agent Mario  Mitchell of San Diego State.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "SEP: Structural Qualification </F> Testing of the Solid Fuel Engine of the Ariane 5"]    [Text] A key phase was passed on 11 February 1994 in the  development of the MPS (Solid Fuel Motor), the solid fuel power  plant of the Ariane 5. CNES [National Center for Space Studies]  has commissioned Europropulsion (a subsidiary of SEP [European  Propulsion Company] France and BPD [Fiat group] Italy) with the  project. Working out of the MPA University of Stuttgart, Man  Technologie of Germany, in charge of developing the body of the  engine, submitted the metal structure of the engine (the most  powerful powder burning engine ever built in Europe) to  structural qualification testing at limit internal and external  loads up to rupture point. Preparation of the model and  procedures had been handled by Man Technologie and Andritz  (Austria) under prime contractorship of Division Propulsion of  Haillan Powder and Composite Propulsion Division. The one-month  test period illustrated the ability of the motor body to  withstand, with the required margins, all stress generated on  the ground and in flight by the MPS and Ariane 5 space rocket.  Rupture occurred under a pressure of 92 bars (1.4 times normal  engine operating pressure) in accordance with the anticipated  scenario.    For the third fire-up test of the MPS now being prepared at  Kourou, engine attachment to structure will be representative of  flight configuration. The qualification testing of 11 February  1994 constitutes the green light of Europropulsion to continue  this preparation work. The Ariane 5 is a program of the  European Space Agency which has commissioned CNES with technical  and financial management.</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Brussels puts telephones plan on hold EUROPEAN Commission plans to liberalise basic telephone services will not be published until the end of September because of French sensitivity over the issue. France is due to hold its referendum on the Maastricht treaty in September, and the state-owned telecommunications company France Telecom is one of the most vociferous opponents of further liberalisation. The Commission yesterday approved directives which would lay the groundwork for greater competition, by harmonising technical and quality standards, and granting third parties access to telephone networks. Brussels also published a paper criticising the excessive cost of cross-border telephone calls. But the Commission withdrew a policy paper laying out how it would open up cross-border calls to competition. Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi, the research and telecommunications commissioner, said: 'We have evaluated all the circumstances and we have decided to delay it (the review) until September 30.' The Commission is proposing supplementary funding of Ecu1.6bn (Pounds 1.13bn) to bridge the financial gap between its 1990-94 research and development programme and the programme for the next five years. At the same time, Mr Pandolfi said yesterday that the Commission was to rationalise the structure of its two research and technology directorates.</p>

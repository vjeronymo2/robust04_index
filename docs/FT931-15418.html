			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Letter: Points to consider on BA/Virgin Sir, Perhaps the most interesting statement in the Virgin/BA affair is that of Sir Colin Marshall that Richard Branson's allegations were 'wholly without foundation and unjustified' ('Virgin's honour remains intact', January 12). There seem to me to be three possibilities: Sir Colin may have deliberately lied; he may have investigated the allegations and found no evidence; or he may have not bothered to investigate them. I think that the shareholders in BA are entitled to know whether their chief executive is venal, incompetent or merely arrogant. John Duffield, 64 Spring Grove, Loughton, Essex IG10 4QE</p>

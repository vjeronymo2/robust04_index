			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The standards for determining discrimination in this area are those utilized in all other areas covered by the Act. Specific practices that violate the Act will be identified and the factual circumstances for identifying violations will be defined. The rule will describe the investigative techniques HUD will utilize, including those HUD employs in current fair housing complaint investigations. The rule will identify remedies to be considered that are appropriate to insurance cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The areas for which HUD specifically requests comment from the public are the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Underwriting practices that may discriminate due to either disparate treatment or disparate impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Sales and marketing practices that may discriminate due to either disparate treatment or disparate impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Explanations or justifications for those industry practices that could be challenged as violations of the Act because of disparate treatment or disparate impact. In cases of disparate impact, explanations should address the business necessity for the practice and why no less discriminatory alternative exists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Barriers to the availability of insurance, or barriers to equal terms and conditions of insurance, for particular protected classes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.

Voluntary actions insurers can take to assure nondiscrimination and to increase availability of insurance to allow access to capital.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Other issues that are relevant to the issue of insurance discrimination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to comments, HUD is also requesting any reports, documents, or other evidence that will assist the Department in evaluating issues to be addressed in the regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD requests that, in submitting comments on any of the foregoing issues, the commenter please cite the item number of the issue addressed by the comment. HUD also welcomes comments on issues related to insurance practices that are not specifically included in the items listed. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: August 10, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Roberta Achtenberg,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;20048 Filed 8&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4210&hyph;28&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Australian Reserve Bank says it will act to cut official cash rates The Reserve Bank of Australia said early today it would act in the money market to cut official cash rates to around 5.25 per cent from 5.75 per cent, Reuter reports from Sydney. The bank also cut its rediscount rate, the rate it pays on Treasury notes prior to maturity, from 6.25 to 5.75 per cent. Mr Bernie Fraser, the bank's governor, said reductions in bank and other interest rates could be expected to follow the cut, which was widely expected by financial markets.</p>

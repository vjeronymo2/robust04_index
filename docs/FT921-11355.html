			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / International Company News: RR Donnelley falls to Dollars 204.9m NET INCOME at R. R. Donnelley, the world's largest provider of print and print-related services, for all 1991 declined to Dollars 204.9m, or Dollars 2.64 a share, from Dollars 225.8m or Dollars 2.91 in 1990, writes Barbara Durr in Chicago. It ended its fourth quarter, however, with net income of Dollars 68.5m, slightly up from Dollars 68.1m in the year-ago period. Earnings per share were 88 cents, the same as last year. The full 1991 results were held down by a recessionary downturn in the advertising, retail and direct mail markets, as well as by a dilution associated with a 1990 acquisition and increased start-up costs for three new plants.</p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: THAI CHADA'S FARE'S FINE, BUT DON'T RELY ON STARS  AS A GUIDE TO THE HEAT  </P> <P> The next time a Texan boasts that he likes his chili so hot that the scent of  it will stew a rattler at 50 paces, take him to the new Thai Chada in  Hillcrest, order a dish that the server considers hot and stand clear.  </P> <P> The heat scale in Thai cooking, like the Richter scale, seems open-ended, and,  in terms of what it can do to the tongue, mouth and throat, almost as devasting  when it reaches the higher numbers. The trick when ordering is to negotiate  exactly the degree that you can tolerate, but not much less, because dishes  designed to be hot tend to lose their sparkle when toned down.  </P> <P> At Thai Chada, however, the act of negotiating the degree of spiciness can be  complicated. By no means are all dishes spicy, but menu notes specify that hot  dishes are marked with one star, and potentially incendiary dishes with two.  These notes do not comment on dishes marked with three stars, but evidently  assume that the uninitiated will think twice before setting off into dangerous  territory.  </P> <P> The star system at times seems relatively meaningless, however, because some  servers will negotiate Western guests down the scale to the point where the  cooking is no more tangy than a plate of mashed potatoes with chicken gravy.  </P> <P> This need not happen. The excellent nam sod salad was ordered at its one-star  strength one evening, despite the waiter's stern "I don't think you will like  it." For all its searing heat, it was absolutely brilliant. Like many Oriental  dishes, this one worked its magic by combining ingredients both cooked and raw,  pungent and savory, salty and sweet -- in this case ground chicken, chopped  peanuts, ginger, chilies, scallions, lime juice, onions and garlic. The ginger,  freshly shredded and much in evidence, seemed to be the key element.  </P> <P> Other salads combine similar assortments of ingredients, but not always with  such fine results. The pra koong (technically a two-star dish, although the  waiter must have told the kitchen to cool it) tossed a goodly number of large  shrimp with slivered red onions, carrots and celery, and added lemon grass and  scallions to the seasoning. But it seemed a weak-kneed relation at best to the  nam sod. Also in this vein are the various yum salads, which combine a choice  of beef, squid and mixed seafoods with cucumbers, tomatoes, onions and a  variety of sharp and pungent seasonings.  </P> <P> Thai restaurants tend to be attractively and carefully decorated, and Thai  Chada follows the rule, with a few prominently displayed artworks setting a  graceful tone. The service also is pleasing, if overly prompt, perhaps as a  means of turning tables at this busy eatery with the greatest possible speed.  (The menu informs guests that they should not think in terms of courses, and  that food will arrive more or less at the same time. This attitude is at odds  with the concept of leisurely dining, and, if left unchallenged, will result in  a profusion of rapidly cooling serving plates scattered across the table. The  remedy, as was discovered on a second visit, is to tell the server to allow an  interval between dishes.)  </P> <P> The appetizer lineup is relatively brief, but offers several first-rate  choices, especially the deceptively uncomplicated "winter" shrimp. These  consist simply of large shrimp shrouded in spring roll skins, the packages  fried until crisp and then served with a refreshingly sweet peanut and cucumber  sauce. Because the flavors are few, the shrimp stand out and seem unusually  succulent. The Chada roll, the house version of the Thai spring roll, contains  a little chopped chicken and a great deal of shredded vegetables, and fails  because of its great girth. The bundles exude so much liquid internally during  the frying process that they arrive more soggy than crisp.  </P> <P> Thai Chada offers 10 kinds of noodle dishes at lunch, but just one, pad thai,  at dinner. Noodles are such a staple of the Thai diet that their general  omission is surprising; pad thai, a standard dish, tops rice noodles with  shrimp, egg, bean sprouts, scallions and the chopped peanuts that add a  distinctive flair to so many Thai dishes.  </P> <P> The entrees range from relatively mild dishes that seem closely related to  Cantonese cuisine to the various Thai curries and the sometimes outrageous  tosses of meat, basil leaves and chilies that are emblematic of Thai cooking.  These employ handfuls of basil along with garlic, peppers and onion, and their  remarkable pungency is matched only by their sometimes volcanic heat. Shrimp,  beef, pork, squid, chicken and duck can be had in this fashion.  </P> <P> Other treatments also extend over a range of meats and seafoods, including a  "string bean" designation that includes not only these innocent legumes, but  chopped turnips and a hot sauce. The curries mostly are based on red curry  paste, which is fairly straightforward and can be excellent, although it needs  to be reasonably hot to be truly tasty. This was one of the dishes that a  server, acting on his own advice, decided might be too much for his guests, and  the resulting chicken curry contained so little red paste as to be disqualified  from the competition.  </P> <P> There is a massaman chicken curry, which gains a puckery quality from the  presence of tamarind juice, but it went unsampled in favor of a rather  disappointing Penang neau, or beef in a coconut-milk-based sauce (hence the  Penang designation, since this city is famous for its coconut curries). The  dish was hot enough, but the beef had the disagreeable flavor and somewhat  rubbery texture of meat that has been cooked well in advance and simply  reheated in a sauce. A similar problem removed much of the quality from the  mild pork with ginger, an otherwise attractive enough dish of sliced pork with  black "tree ear" mushrooms, slivered vegetables and a good dose of fresh  ginger.  </P> <P> The list of house specialties includes the wonderful "Royal Thai" omelet, a  fat, fluffy, platter-size amalgam of beaten eggs that encloses chicken,  vegetables and a savory sauce; it is definitely one of the best dishes here.  Other possibilities on this list include the squid stuffed with noodles,  chicken and mushrooms, the chicken in peanut sauce (pra-ram-long-song), the  shrimp with bean threads and the "hot pot" of mixed seafoods.  </P> <P> The restaurant offers a genuine Thai dessert, squash custard, although Western  guests may find little that is dessert-like about it. The name is somewhat  misleading, since it is not a custard made of squash, but rather a large wedge  of the vegetable, baked and topped with a sort of stiff pudding of carrots and  a little unsweetened coconut. It is bland, but that may be exactly the effect  Thai cooks wish to offer after a meal that can be (at least at times) as hot as  a day spent stoking a blast furnace.  </P> <P> THAI CHADA  </P> <P> 142 University Ave.  </P> <P> 297-9548  </P> <P> Lunch Monday through Friday, dinner nightly.  </P> <P> Credit cards accepted.  </P> <P> Dinner for two, including a glass of wine each, tax and tip, $25 to $50.  </P></p>

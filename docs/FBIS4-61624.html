			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "K. Nesterov Does Not Sign Treaty on </F> Accord"]    [Text] According to informed sources, during the signing  ceremony for the Social Accord Treaty in the Kremlin yesterday,  Kirill Nesterov, representative of the Russian Mass Media  Creative Workers Trade Union, did not sign the proposed  document. His colleagues point out that this is likely due to  the fact that the 36 editorial offices -- collective members of  the trade union being evicted from by the government from 19  Novyy Arbat -- have not yet been provided with suitable work  premises.</p>

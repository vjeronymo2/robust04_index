			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / No, no, no, no way out It is too easy to deride Mr John Major for his performance at Corfu. The British prime minister found himself in a minority of one out of 12 members of the European Union, just like his predecessor at earlier summits. He handbagged the appointment of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene to the presidency of the European Commission, precisely as she might have done. It is said, with disdain, that Mr Major's motives were self-serving. Sure they were. Worse, it is claimed that he sought approving headlines in the ever-cheaper Conservative newspapers published by Mr Conrad Black and Mr Rupert Murdoch. Anyone in his position would be tempted to do that, although not all would succumb. It is asserted that his principal aim was the preservation of his leadership of an increasingly Eurosceptical Conservative party. Of course it was. Yet the prime minister had a defensible diplomatic objective. As we all know, Mr Dehaene was the candidate thrust upon Europe by Mr Helmut Kohl and Mr Francois Mitterrand. The German chancellor and the French president appear to have believed the rest of the EU would come round to their way of thinking, as indeed all but Britain did. If this be so, the veto is not wholly regrettable. Europe is not France and Germany alone. Bonn and Paris lead the continent, but they should not take their predominance for granted. When Mr Major told the House of Commons yesterday that rejection of Mr Dehaene was a matter of principle he did not mention Mr Kohl or Mr Mitterrand, but we knew what he meant. He had no need to name names. He was telling the world his weakness among his own voters should not lead others to take Britain's compliance for granted. He is not a popular prime minister, but he would be nothing at all if he did not get that message across. He seemed to have his party's support. Sir Edward Heath was wrong to call the outcome of the Corfu meeting a crisis for Europe. It was not even a disaster, merely a little drama. Mr Dehaene will survive in politics. He still has his job. Europe will move on. Another candidate for the presidency of the Commission will be found. The individual who succeeds will almost certainly not be wedded to the British Conservative party's views on Europe. Take, for example, the Dutch prime minister, Mr Ruud Lubbers. He was highly praised by Mr Major yesterday, and not for the first time. It is reasonable to assume that Britain would support him if others did. This is not explicable in simple pro- or anti-Europe terms. It was Mr Lubbers' government that nearly botched the negotiations leading to the Maastricht treaty. The infamous Dutch draft of early autumn 1991 was shamelessly Euro-expansionary in tone. The Commission's powers would have been enhanced even more than they eventually were. The draft had to be scrapped for progress to be made. The Dutch prime minister's thinking has since evolved, but that is another matter. Mr Major's veto of Mr Dehaene cannot be said to have been cast on anti-federal or anti-Brussels grounds while there is a possibility of British support for Mr Lubbers. Sir Edward was more persuasive when he intimated that a Eurosceptical Britain would be less able to influence the course of events on the continent. Probably, but Mr Major alone is not to blame for this. He is a puppet of history. As soon as he became prime minister he said that his purpose was to place Britain at the heart of Europe. He was highly praised for that noble aspiration. He adopted a distinctly different tone from the then just-fallen Mrs Thatcher. The proximate cause of her ejection from office was a persistently anti-Brussels screech. Mr Major, we all thought, would do better. The Tories were the party of Europe. That is where he would make a positive contribution. He never had a chance. For half a century English nationalism has tugged Britain backwards when its continental partners have sought to move their ever-closer union forwards. This streak of scepticism runs through all parties, although it is at present in the ascendancy among Conservatives. The prime minister is weak because he has a small majority in the Commons. He might have tried to tough it out, taking a stand on one side or the other, but he has preferred the strategy of the whip he once was. This has given the sceptics their leverage. In consequence there is now a distinct possibility that the issue of how pro- or anti-European the opposing parties are will be deployed by Mr Major in the next British general election, assuming he is still there to do the deploying. We saw this during the elections to the European Parliament a few weeks ago. The Conservative manifesto, 'a strong Britain in a strong Europe' was meant to unite the party. Each wing could read what it chose into the small print. The tone of the campaign was intermittently anti-European. Yet the government tells anyone who will listen it has found a formula to placate all but the extreme Europhobes or Europhiles among the Tories. This was set out in Mr Major's speech about a multi-speed Europe. The notion was first given public prominence by Mr Douglas Hurd at the Sejm in Warsaw on May 6. 'The Europe of Monet and Schuman was right for its time,' the foreign secretary said, adding that what was now taking shape was 'a multi-speed, multi-track, even multi-faceted Europe'. This could mean Britain asking for a stronger arrangement on defence and, as indicated by Mr Major yesterday, anti-drugs policing, but opt-outs elsewhere. 'Multi-speed' should play better than 'two-speed'. That would imply that Britain is in the slow lane. The multi-speed Europe of Mr Hurd is not in itself negative, or not sold as such. It reflects current reality. It allows new members to take part at their own pace. The trouble with the formula is that it is deficient in positive proposals, lacking in enthusiasm for whatever is happening on the continent. Britain cannot get its own candidate into the Commission presidency. It merely vetoes others. The chances are that Mr Major, pulled ever sceptic-wards, will find himself always accentuating the negative - no to Mr Dehaene, no to rejoining the exchange rate mechanism, no to the single currency, no to the social chapter; 'no', as his predecessor famously said, 'no, no, no, no.' We know what happened to her.</p>

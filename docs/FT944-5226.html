			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Media Futures: Take me out to the high-tech ballgame Jay Mariotti, racing his deadline for the Rocky Mountain News, types on his lap-top the closing words of his report. An earthquake has cut short the baseball World Series at Candlestick Park on the bay of San Francisco, interrupting the game between the Giants and the Oakland Athletics. Tremors have rocked the press box. The stadium has been evacuated. Mariotti has a very big story. But even though he is a pack-leading techno-journalist, how does he file from a disaster zone? Anecdotally, sports-writers are the most versatile professionals of their time: first to recognise and adopt the technologies that can make their working lives easier; routinely meeting deadlines that would give other journalists nightmares. They own arsenals of media machines. To do his job, a typical US sports-writer will have a lap-top, micro-cassette recorder, mini-TV (to monitor a game while attending another), a radio and a car telephone as well as a home fax machine and a powerful computer. The Chicago Bulls basketball team recently brought their press room up to state-of-the-art standards. But such conditions are rare. More often, sports-writers have to find ingenious ways to send their stories, surmounting technical difficulties that would appal colleagues on other newspaper desks. 'It's not enough to be a sports reporter any more,' says Michael Mulligan of the Chicago Sun-Times, assigned to follow the Chicago Bears football team this season. 'Now you have to be a computer expert and a phone expert as well.' Writers are responding - quickly - to the waves of change sweeping through sports generally, for sports organisations have also swiftly utilised the so-called information superhighway. The NBA's Faxback service allows users to dial in to the NBA's database from a fax machine anywhere in order to call up statistics and press releases on any team or player 24 hours a day. Details can be faxed or uploaded into users' computers. Sports coaches are taking analysis of games to extremes by using new technologies. Gone forever are the days when Adolph Rupp, basketball coach at the University of Kentucky, could post his play-book to his opponents with a covering note: 'Here's what we're going to do. Try to stop us.' Game analysis is now a science. For a long time, sports coaches have been using video. 'We even look for video cameras in the shower,' says defensive end Trace Armstrong of the Chicago Bears. Further ahead, the possibilities offerred by virtual reality devices are exciting. The day may not be far distant when a boxer or soccer player rehearses for a fight or game against a specially-programmed virtual double of his opponent. Exactly how, in the end, did Mariotti file his story from the devastated San Francisco World Series stadium? Answer: he found a single intact telephone cable in the damaged stadium's parking lot. A colleague saw him, and within minutes 20 international sportswriters had lined up - in time-zone order - with their lap-tops. They may be techno-journalists but, strange to relate, sports-writers are also gentlemen.</p>

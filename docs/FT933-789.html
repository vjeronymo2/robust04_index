			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Brown pledges Labour drive for full employment: Party policy shifts towards growth and jobs MR GORDON BROWN, the shadow chancellor, yesterday unveiled a calculated shift in his party's economic strategy with a commitment to make firm targets for growth and full employment the priority of a future Labour government. Setting the stage for a concerted attack on government policies before the November Budget, Mr Brown also pledged a clampdown on a range of tax concessions enjoyed by companies and wealthy individuals. But his attempt to win the initiative over economic policy on the opening day of the party's Brighton conference was overshadowed by a public rift between Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, and Mrs Margaret Beckett, his deputy. To the fury of Mr Smith's aides, Mrs Beckett broke a shadow cabinet agreement and refused to give him unequivocal backing ahead of tomorrow's crucial conference vote on reforming the party's links with the trades unions. Mrs Dawn Primarolo, a less senior member of the frontbench team, openly criticised the leader's stance. The outcome of the vote was still balanced on a knife-edge last night as senior colleagues acknowledged that a defeat would be a severe blow to Mr Smith's authority. On the day which saw Mr Tony Benn, the veteran left-winger, lose his place on the party's national executive after 34 years, Mr Brown used an overtly populist speech to the conference to argue that mass unemployment had become the 'over-riding challenge of the 1990s'. Labour's response would be to ensure 'the full power of government' was directed towards 'full and fulfilling employment'. A future Labour government would set a 'growth target' for the economy and invest in expanding demand and capacity. Stressing his party's commitment to the poor and the elderly, Mr Brown said it would also introduce a national minimum wage and would end benefits 'means-testing' for those beyond retirement age. His emphasis on growth and employment was a sign of the pressure he has been under from within the party to embrace a more expansionist, interventionist stance. But it went only half-way to meeting the demand of union leaders such as Mr John Edmonds who yesterday called on Labour to abandon the government-imposed spending, tax and borrowing constraints. Catching the general mood of a series of motions passed by the conference, Mr Edmonds, leader of the GMB union, said Labour should disavow its cautious approach to economic policy in favour of 'boldness, imagination and belief in our own values'. But the Labour leadership believes the shift in strategy announced yesterday will position the party for a continuous onslaught on the government in the two months before the Budget. Mr Smith will reinforce that approach with a speech to the conference today in which he will combine a lengthy attack on the government with a commitment to a raft of new industrial, training and education policies. Mr Brown reiterated his commitment to a 'fair and progressive' tax system, but refused to specify what this might mean for the tax rates of individual voters. Instead he concentrated on setting out what he said were a series of tax 'loopholes' which would be closed by Labour. These included the abuse of non-domicile status by overseas companies, unacceptable definitions of residence and the continuing misuse of offshore trusts. Labour would also close down tax relief on executive share option schemes and end petroleum revenue tax provisions which allowed oil companies to manipulate oil cargo prices.

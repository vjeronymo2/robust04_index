			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> UNFAIR TO HARVARD SCHOOL  </P> <P> You have misportrayed the students, faculty and parents of Harvard School.  </P> <P> You said the opinion of Westlake's administration concerning Harvard boys was  that they are "obnoxious." If Westlake truly believed this, they would  certainly halt the proposed merger. After all, both Harvard and Westlake  Schools exist to benefit the students.  </P> <P> You also pointed out that Harvard Headmaster Thomas Hudnut was a member of an  exclusive, all-male club in the District of Columbia. The fact that the club  has since changed its policies about admitting women shows that men and women  are breaking traditions in order to work together in our ever-changing society.  Like a club changing its admission policies, the merger of Harvard and Westlake  Schools is meant to preserve and enhance the heritages of both schools, to the  benefit of all the students.  </P> <P> Also of great concern was your mention that the Harvard-Westlake School may  need zoning changes and/or conditional-use permits and that a Westlake father  sits on the city Planning Commission, while a Harvard father serves on the  Board of Zoning Appeals. If, by this snide remark, you are suggesting that  Harvard and Westlake Schools use political influence to gain flavors, I would  like to hear about it. But until you have facts stating so, please do not  bad-mouth two fine institutions.  </P> <P> MATT JACOBS  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STREET CLOSURES URGED NEAR DANA STRAND HOUSING PROJECT  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores has called for the closure of  several streets and alleys near the Dana Strand housing project in Wilmington.  </P> <P> In a motion she introduced at a council meeting, Flores said closing the roads  will enable city officials to erect a security fence around the public housing  project.  </P> <P> The fence, she said, would "create a more secure community by helping to reduce  crime and protecting improvements" to the project.  </P> <P> The fence and other improvements are part of a $14-million face lift to housing  projects throughout the city, paid for by the U.S. Department of Housing and  Urban Development.  </P> <P> The action, officials said, is not related to recent gang violence at Dana  Strand.  </P> <P> "This has been in the works for some time; we were just waiting for engineering  reports to be completed," Flores spokeswoman Karen Constine said.  </P> <P> Flores' proposal, forwarded by the council to its Public Works Committee, calls  for closing King Avenue from C to F streets; D Street from Hawaiian Avenue to  Wilmington Boulevard; E Street from Hawaiian to Wilmington; the alley east of  Hawaiian from E to C streets, and the alley west of Wilmington from F to C  streets.  </P></p>

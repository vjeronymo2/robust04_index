			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / International Company News: EAC to sell meat unit share EAST Asiatic Company (EAC), Denmark's largest trading group, has announced plans to sell 60 per cent of its Plumrose meat processing division to a group of Danish companies led by Tulip International. The disposal is part of an attempt by EAC to raise funds to pull itself out of its present financial difficulties. The group is also negotiating the sale of its US graphics division, Heidelberg Eastern, to the German company Heidelberger Druckmaschinen, which has interests in the west of the US. EAC said it would concentrate its future graphics business on Asia and Australia while maintaining investments in Scandinavia and Africa. The divestments follow the recent appointment of Mr Michael Fiorini, former finance manager of the A. P. Moller group, as chief executive of the heavily-indebted EAC. In its half-year report, EAC forecast a loss of DKr425m (Dollars 68m) for 1992. However, analysts now expect this figure to be considerably larger. The Plumrose deal involves 10 factories in the UK, Germany and the US with a combined turnover of about DKr4bn. A letter of intent has been issued to Tulip International, which is seeking backing from international investors. It hopes to conclude the sale before Christmas. Tulip International already has factories in Denmark, Germany and the UK as well as growing exports to the US, and has itself been through an extensive restructuring in the past two years. Its partners in the deal are slaughter companies Danish Crown, Steffi-Houlberg and Tican. The merger would create one of the largest forces in the international meat trade. EAC is also streamlining its shipping division through the sale of a 60 per cent stake in EACBen, its container service between Europe and the Far East, to American President Lines. EAC's two newest container vessels are being sold to the venture, which is capitalised at Dollars 120m.</p>

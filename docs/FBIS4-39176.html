			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 7 TASS -- ROSSIYSKIYE GAZETA on Russia's  state budget for 1994.    In an article headlined "We Are All Hostages of the  Military-  Industrial Complex", the newspaper describes it as a war-time  budget.    Comparing last year's and this year's state expenditure, the  writer of the article arrives at a conclusion that no military  reform is underway in the country and, as a consequence, there  is no reduction in military expenditure.    ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, in another article, reports that an  attempt by high-speed Japanese schooners to intrude into Russian  territorial waters en masse was stopped in the area of south  Kurils. The chief committee of Russia's frontier forces views  the attempt as a test of vigilance of the forces involved in the  Putina (Fishing Season)-94 anti-poaching operation.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with General  Aleksandr Lebed, commander of the 14th Russian Army stationed in  Tiraspol.    "In the Dniester region, one should not act by strongarm  tactics. It is necessary to democratise the situation.  Historical experience indicates that all wars end with peace.  Wise is the one who prevents a war and, if it still breaks out,  brings it to an end as soon as possible and keeps peace for as  long as possible," Lebed said.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs an interview with Viktor Davydkin,  deputy chairman of Russia's Choice movement, who said: "The  democratic movement is heterogeneous and it is possible to unite  it only on the basis of flexible, even loose blocs, movements,  etc. We are in for a difficult struggle against nascent fascism  in Russia. But this struggle can be effective only if we act in  alliance with all anti-fascist forces."    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI reports that Russia's first food quality  control laboratory, financed by the European Union, has opened  in the city of Pushchino near Moscow on the basis of the Russian  Academy of Sciences' Institute of Bio-Chemistry and Physiology  of Microorganisms and the Pushchino Agrocollege.    The job of the laboratory is to analyse food passing through  the customs and supplied to private shops from  individually-operated farms.    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI comments on rumours about the possibility  of an increase in the prices of bread in Russia:    "Elementary economic calculations show that one tonne of  Canadian grain in St. Petersburg will be under any circumstances  100,000 roubles cheaper than Krasnodar-produced one.    "If the situation concerning the prime cost of nationally  produced grain does not change and transportation tariffs  continue to grow rapidly, loafs of imported bread will soon be  on sale in commercial kiosks at prices that will be much more  acceptable than those in a nearby bakery shop".    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI interviewed Crimean Vice-Premier Yevgeniy  Saburov who set out his vision of the Crimea's future.    Saburov visualises the Crimea "first of all, as part of  Ukraine, with transparent borders and dual citizenship, after  European standards, well-established social and cultural  contacts with Russia. Private international capital.  Recreation, an elite agriculture, transport arteries, airports,  seaports. The Crimea as a bridge of friendship between East and  West".    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI runs an interview with Yuriy Tompakov,  departmental chief at the Moscow prosecutor's office directorate  for the supervision of investigation.    His opinion is that "it is increasingly probable that  criminal outfits may take the path of terrorist acts against  prominent businessmen, bankers, representatives of political  parties and public organisations, civil servants, and deputies.  Attempts on the life of members of personnel of law enforcement  agencies cannot be ruled out either".    TRUD carries an interview with Russian Defence Minister  Pavel  Grachev who said: "We have to change the structure of the armed  forces, their manning system, withdraw troops from abroad and  accommodate them at home, constantly maintain their fighting  efficiency at proper level and at the same time tackle a lot of  legislative and social issues.    "We have brought back to Russia about 140 units at an  aggregate strength of 280,000. All that is being done with more  than modest funding. The shortage of funds results in lack of  housing, poor accommodation, grievances and disappointments."    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) reports that criminal groups in  southern Russia try to counteract the Russian Interior Ministry  Putina-94 anti-poaching operation in the Caspian. "This is why  we have to use firearms when detaining poachers," Police Colonel  Aleksandr Frolov, chief of the operation headquarters, told the  newspaper.    Several tens of firearms, including submachine-guns, were  withdrawn from criminal groups during the operation in the  Caspian. Ammunition for bear hunting was also confiscated at  poachers' bases that had been discovered.    RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA runs an interview with Major-General  Nikolay Bezborodov, deputy chairman of the Russian State Duma  committee on defence, who dwelt on Russo-Azerbaijani relations.    "The language of ultimata is not the best one, still less in  a most complex situation. It is high time the ministers of  defence and foreign affairs gave explanations to the deputies  about a number of problems that have piled up".</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Anglia Television profits fade to Pounds 8.7m ANGLIA TELEVISION yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.73m for the 14-month period ended December 31 1991, substantially down on the Pounds 14.9m in the twelve months to October 31 1990. The result was in line with analysts' forecasts. The final dividend is maintained at 6.4p, making an unchanged total of 9.26p. Earnings per share declined to 13.31p (21.89p). Operating profit fell almost Pounds 3m to Pounds 14.9m. Anglia's share of the ITV network's total revenue rose slightly from 6.72 per cent to 6.75 per cent. Advertising revenue was Pounds 127.3m (Pounds 108.9m) with an extra Pounds 22.35m (Pounds 12.9m) from programme sales. Turnover showed an increase from Pounds 124.5m to Pounds 153.4m. The Pounds 2.96m cost of renewing its franchise was taken as an extraordinary charge as was a provision of Pounds 13.3m for restructuring and writing down its original Pounds 12m stake in BSkyB, the satellite television broadcaster, to a nominal Pounds 100,000. Sir Peter Gibbings, chairman, said that Anglia took the view that BSkyB  - in which Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times, has a stake - is unlikely to be profitable before the end of the century. Writing down the investment was thus 'prudent accounting'. Sir Peter added that staff levels had been reduced by some 23 per cent, from 820 to 633, since 1989 but no further redundancies were envisaged. Last October the company retained its franchise to broadcast in the east of England region with a Pounds 17.8m bid Net current assets at the end of 1991 were Pounds 43.6m (Pounds 29.6m). Sir Peter said: 'At a time like this, keeping light on your feet and having a pile of cash in the bank does not seem a bad approach.' Analysts are forecasting 1992 pre-tax profits of between Pounds 14m and Pounds 18m.</p>

			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLEAN NEEDLE USE MAY BE SLOWING SPREAD OF AIDS  </P> <P> The alarming rate of AIDS virus infection among intravenous drug users in San  Francisco, New York and several other cities appears to be stabilizing,  according to surprising new findings that suggest that there may be hope of  controlling the epidemic in that pivotal group.  </P> <P> Researchers said the findings, published in part today in the Journal of the  American Medical Assn., suggest that it is possible to persuade drug users to  use clean needles -- and thus perhaps to slow the spread of AIDS among drug  users, their sexual partners and their children.  </P> <P> Some experts, however, warned against misinterpreting the findings. The  infection rate may be leveling off in those cities, but users are still  becoming infected. Some already infected may be dropping out of the groups  being studied, while new, uninfected users enter.  </P> <P> "It's not that nobody's getting infected anymore," said Andrew Moss, a UC San  Francisco epidemiologist studying intravenous drug users in that city. "It's  that a lot of people have cleaned up their act, and a smaller number of people  are getting infected."  </P> <P> The study published today by a team of prominent AIDS researchers, tracks the  once-soaring rise in human immunodeficiency virus infection among drug users in  Manhattan. It concludes that the infection rate has hovered for the last four  years between 55% and 60%.  </P> <P> That apparent stabilization is in contrast to the pattern seen in the previous  five years in the Manhattan study, which involved nearly 700 subjects. The rate  of infection during that period leaped from 9% in 1978 to 38% in 1980 to 50% in  1983, the authors calculated based on analysis of stored blood samples.  </P> <P> The leveling off also defies traditional infectious disease patterns, in which  the increase in the infection rate is highest after half the population becomes  infected. This pattern has been evident in the case of hepatitis B, which is  believed to infect 80% to 95% of New York intravenous drug users.  </P> <P> "It's clearly encouraging in the sense that we haven't seen the massive  explosion continuing," said Samuel Friedman, a researcher with Narcotic and  Drug Research Inc., a nonprofit group affiliated with the New York State  Division of Substance Abuse Services.  </P> <P> The researchers suggested that cities such as Los Angeles, with relatively low  infection rates, could benefit by implementing aggressive AIDS prevention  programs among drug users -- similar to those that have been in place in San  Francisco and New York for several years.  </P> <P> The study was headed by Don C. Des Jarlais, AIDS research coordinator in the  state substance abuse services division. The other co-authors include  researchers with three large New York City hospitals and the federal Centers  for Disease Control.  </P> <P> Similar patterns of relatively stable rates of human immunodeficiency virus  infection have also begun to emerge in San Francisco, Stockholm and Innsbruck,  Austria, according to the Manhattan study and AIDS researchers in San  Francisco.  </P> <P> John Watters, a UC San Francisco epidemiologist studying thousands of  intravenous drug users on the street and entering drug abuse treatment, said in  an interview that the rate of infection among heterosexual users appears to  have remained steady at about 14% since early 1987. That rate had jumped from  below 5% in 1983 to 10% in 1985, according to other studies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pioneer Programs  </P> <P> "I think it provides hope that you really can have an effect with this  population," Watters said. In particular, he pointed to pioneering  AIDS-education and prevention programs begun in San Francisco in 1986 and  targeted to intravenous drug users.  </P> <P> Watters and others nevertheless cautioned against excessive optimism.  </P> <P> "The fact that (the infection rate) is not going down, and there's evidence  that new infection continues right up to the present, is worrisome," said  Timothy J. Dondero of the Centers for Disease Control. "If it's stable at a  relatively high level, that's pretty bad."  </P> <P> The reasons for the apparent stabilization are not clear.  </P> <P> One contributing factor may lie in the way studies are designed, relying at  least in part on drug users entering treatment programs. Some infected users  drop out of the pool -- because of illness, for example. Although they remain  infected, they are no longer counted.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, new drug users are entering the pool. Chances are, they are not yet  infected. They would tend to "dilute" the group being studied, helping  stabilize the infection rate somewhere below 100% saturation.  </P> <P> Perhaps most significantly, the researchers believe that the leveling off  reflects the fact that some drug users are using needles more safely than in  the past -- for example, not sharing needles with others and sterilizing their  equipment with bleach before each use.  </P> <P> Researchers said it would behoove cities such as Los Angeles, where the virus  arrived late among drug users and the infection rate is still low, to take  advantage of the opportunity to avert a dramatic rise by setting up aggressive  AIDS prevention programs.  </P> <P> "You've (Los Angeles) been lucky. It reached you late," said Friedman. Pointing  out that the infection rate in Bangkok, Thailand, jumped from 18% to 40% in  1988 alone, he added, "You've got a moment, maybe, where the dynamics are going  in your favor."  </P> <P> Efforts to educate the estimated 80,000 to 130,000 intravenous drug users in  Los Angeles County about the risk of spreading infected blood in shared needles  have been slowed by an official unwillingness to support programs believed to  have worked in other cities.  </P> <P> Four of the five county supervisors voted last August to reject plans to  distribute bleach kits and condoms to drug users, suggesting that such a  practice would be immoral. The plan had the backing of the county Department of  Health Services and the county Commission on AIDS.  </P> <P> Currently, 30 county-financed outreach workers are assigned to educate  intravenous drug users about AIDS virus transmission and prevention. The county  also has plans to increase human immunodeficiency virus testing for drug users  in drug-abuse treatment programs.  </P> <P> Robert Frangenberg, director of the county AIDS program, said in an interview  that he agrees with the Manhattan researchers' statement in their study that  Los Angeles and comparable cities may be facing a prime opportunity to avert a  dramatic rise in infection.  </P> <P> "I think it's a great preventive health opportunity," Frangenberg said. "If we  could distribute bleach and condoms and expand the number of people in the  community providing (AIDS prevention) services, I think that could be helpful."  </P> <P> Scientists have developed a molecular picture of an enzyme that the AIDS virus  needs to grow.

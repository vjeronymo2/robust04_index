			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Government Session"] </F>   [Text] The Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] Government adopted the law on settlement of  debts toward international institutions. According to this law,  the firms will pay their 60 million denars debt owed to the  international bank to the state instead. They are to settle the  debt in eight years, with a grace period of three years and an  annual interest rate of six percent, paid in five equal rates,  starting from 31 March 1997.    The government also adopted the proposed law on changes in  existing law on administrative taxes. This law balances  administrative services taxes, including the state's diplomatic  and consular representative offices abroad, with the predicted  annual inflation of 70 percent.    Government members postponed the discussion on the law on  census as the Statistics Institute submitted an incomplete  financial report. The institute only informs of approved  finances for the census procedure, but no formal confirmation  has been received by any international financial institution so  far. The census is evaluated to cost about $2.2 million and if  the financial side is not settled in due time, it is hard to  expect it will take place in June as planned.</p>

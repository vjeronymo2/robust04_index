			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Cuban President Fidel Castro by unidentified </F> Cuban reporters in South Africa; date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Unidentified reporter] Earlier this month, an ANC  representative discussed the preceding events and explained  that, once Nelson Mandela was inaugurated, South Africa would  proceed to establish diplomatic relations with Cuba. That is  their intent. They even included this in a document known as the  New South Africa Foreign Policy Charter.    In view of the fact that we have already attended the  inauguration and that certain talks have been held with cabinet  representatives, what are the prospects that this will become a  reality?    [Castro] Well, from the point of view of our relations with  Mandela, the ANC, we have more than diplomatic relations. We  have had close ties of brotherhood for many years. I believe we  are family. Regarding foreign relations we are not demanding  anything, or putting conditions; the closer our friendship with  a country, the less we ask to establish ties. We allow  circumstances and the appropriate moment to determine the  establishment of ties. In the special case of South Africa, at  this time, we could not make a definitive statement.    I have been received here like a brother, like a son.  However, we have not pressed the issue of formal ties. I believe  that perhaps tomorrow it will be brought up in the talks with  the foreign minister. Robertico [Robaina] has been talking with  the foreign minister. Tomorrow, I will again meet with Mandela.  Perhaps he will bring this up and ties will be immediately  established. However, we will not bring it up. We must bear in  mind what is good for them, and the appropriate moment to  formalize ties, rather than bringing it up as a demand or as a  request from us.    However, it seems inevitable that those ties will be  established quickly because there are few countries with whom we  have stronger ties -- kinship and fraternal ties.    Today I greeted almost every minister. I do not speak with  ministers of other countries. We talked like old relatives. I am  convinced all of them want the prompt establishment of ties; but  out of a basic sense of courtesy and respect, we should not  exert pressure. They can do it whenever they are ready.  Relations, de facto, are very strong between South Africa and  Cuba.    Now, it is a matter of formalities. That formality could be  fulfilled today, tomorrow, or the day after. Very soon.    [Unidentified reporter] Commander, further on this issue but  on another aspect, independently of whenever the diplomatic ties  are established: In what fields do you believe that cooperation  could be developed the furthest in areas of common interest  between Cuba and South Africa?    [Castro] Whenever we speak with South Africans or South  African cadres, we discover great prospects. The first thing we  notice is in the spiritual sphere. When they talk with us, at  times, the things they say truly moved us. They express a  fondness for Cuba which leaves us really speechless. There is an  incredible bond of affection. I believe that few times has there  been such a great bond with any country. When we speak with them  and discuss their plans and ideas, given South Africa's  condition, on one hand they have great development and high  living standards; on the other hand, great social needs, for  example, enormous need for housing, public health, schooling,  and jobs. I was talking with the transportation people. I was  introduced to every minister today at the luncheon. I was told  they have many people who lack the means to move. I spoke with  the transportation minister who said he has a difficult task  ahead of him because means of transportation are inadequate even  though it is a developed country. South Africa is a developed  country. It has important technology, important industries; yet  it has a large population that for many years has lived under  apartheid and has a great stash of needs and dreams of a better  life.    Therefore, the government is faced with having to find  solutions to those problems. When you speak with the  transportation minister you find out about these needs. When you  speak with the housing minister, you find out about those great  needs. When you speak with the sports ministers, you find about  their dreams of developing sports. If you talk with the public  health minister, you see their dreams of improving their  people's health services; thus, the enormous social sphere on  which there are prospects for cooperation between both nations.  This would be beneficial both ways: cooperation from us based on  our experiences, as well as South African cooperation based on  their experiences, and technological development.    [Text] I also spoke with the education minister. They have  great education projects. In other words, all you need to do is  talk a while with each one of these cadres and ministers to  understand that there is a very broad field for cooperation  between Cuba and South Africa. This is undoubtedly the most  developed country in southern Africa.    You should see the road infrastructure. I was telling the  transportation minister: You may have a problem of not enough  means of transportation, but you have great roads. They have  good infrastructure in many areas. The problem is that the  wealth has not been distributed fairly. You find, next to a  superdeveloped world, let us say, an underdeveloped world.    With no other country, even in Latin America, are there such  prospects for cooperation as there are between South Africa and  Cuba, to the extent that we seriously work and study  possibilities and continue to develop that highly fraternal and  warm bond between our two peoples. I must add that we have taken  notice of the very respectful treatment extended to us by every  social sector, not only by ANC members but by the nonblack and  mixed blood sectors, as well. We have also been welcomed by the  white population. We have to keep in mind that this is a  multiracial nation with millions of people from diverse ethnic  backgrounds who have a vital need to cooperate among themselves.  Today, we saw this spirit of cooperation.    Everyone is saying, and justifiably, that the hardest part  begins now. Everyone knows that the hardest part follows the  period of change, of liberation. That is true. I do not think  his [Mandela's] task is easy. However, I believe that they have  developed a significant talent to find solutions. What we saw  today heightened our optimism regarding South Africa's future.  Although we cannot say that South Africa's problems are solved,  they have solved great problems. They have reached today, but I  think they are going to have to continue the struggle. There is  no doubt that Mandela is the man with all the qualifications to  lead this process. He has secured decisive support. I believe he  has to continue working to consolidate what has been achieved so  far and avoid divisiveness. A united country is essential. This  is what we most hope for, and we hope they attain it. Cuba will  be very proud to develop cooperation with South Africa.    [Unidentified reporter] Commander, right now, in such a  convulsed world, what does Mandela's victory mean for the  progressive forces?    [Castro] I believe it is a great victory, a great victory of  the South African peoples, the African people, and all the  progressive forces in the world. It is a veritable example and  hope. I believe that South Africa is called upon to exert a  great and positive influence over the entire continent. It is a  renaissance, a revival, proof that great victories can be  achieved even after the disasters that have befallen the world  and that many things are still possible in a unipolar world.    [Unidentified reporter] Commander, for many years, Cuba and  South Africa had great differences because of Angola. Did you  ever think then, or later, that you would be here today in the  former capital of apartheid?    [Castro] Well, there are two South Africas and two moments  in  history. For specific reasons, strong clashes took place at a  certain time in history. Now, however, there is a new South  Africa in which such clashes no longer exist -- only peace,  harmony, respect, and affection.    Your question dealing with Angola is very difficult to  answer. First of all, we had to save Angola and its  independence. We were in Angola for 15 years. From the beginning  of intervention by foreign forces in Angola, we gave it our  support -- for 15 years. So many things happened. We had a  strong presence, but it was not strong enough because we could  not, nor did it depend on us alone to, reach a solution to the  problem.    In Angola we fought with the greatest selflessness. The rest  was the responsibility of the Angolan people. We were not  Angola's only supporters. Nevertheless, we can say that we  helped, selflessly and with great loyalty. I would say that our  support was very efficient, and that Cuba's support was not only  efficient, but intelligent. We have no reason to regret anything  we did. Rather, we could say that several difficult times were  confronted -- difficult but not through our fault. Cuba  fulfilled its duty every step of the way. Cuba contributed to  the solution of the highly difficult problems that arose. I do  not want to criticize anyone. I believe today is not a day to  criticize. Perhaps history will record this.    This reminds me of what Jose Eduardo [dos Santos] said to  me during today's luncheon, the very heartfelt, friendly words  from the depths of his soul regarding the [words indistinct]  meaning of Cuba's support to the southern Africa nations of  Angola, Namibia, and South Africa. He pronounced truly moving  words. This is why, in the analysis of our conscience, we find  nothing to reproach.    In one of the most difficult periods, in the end, we had to  make very hard decisions; and we did so. They were the correct  decisions. The problem had to be solved. We could not afford to  be so weak that we had to endure foreign intervention and be  strong enough to solve the issues of foreign intervention. In  such cases, if you are weak, you may incur a great defeat; if  you are strong, you can spare many lives. This is the way it  happened in Angola. We accumulated such a potential that it was  possible to solve the conflict with a minimal loss of lives.  Those were decisions made by Cuba, alone and solely. History has  been distorted many times; but in 1975, when we decided to help  the Angolan people against foreign intervention, the decision  was Cuba's alone. At other times when we had to act in difficult  situations, the decisions were Cuba's alone; at times, it is sad  to say, in order to overcome mistakes made by others. I do not  want to say by whom. However, I am not going to blame the  Angolans; it was others.    We found we needed to act; even in the last, very difficult  situation, mistakes were made -- not our mistakes. That final  situation was decisive or Angola would have been lost, with all  the consequences and losses that would mean for the Angolan  people and ourselves. All this influenced the events that  afterward culminated in those negotiations by virtue of which  Namibia's independence was attained with the implementation of  Resolution 435.    I think this helped accelerate the process of the South  African struggle against apartheid. The main, essential, and  decisive merit belongs to the South African people. Our action  might have helped accelerate that process. This is how we see  it. This is a subject on which we have to be very careful. We  should not be the ones speaking about this, but others. The  South African and Angolan peoples have spoken of the selfless  and noble solidarity of Cuba with their countries. We lived  diverse moments which I believe shall be recorded in history as  they happened.    To date, I see the events and development of the situation  in  South Africa as something wonderful. Much depends on what  happens in South Africa, whether the country attains peace,  harmony, and unity. This is what all of us ought to struggle for  and contribute toward, so that the result of the efforts and  sacrifices of many create a country that can serve as a model to  the world on how to solve such complex problems as the ones  experienced here.    [Unidentified reporter] Commander, do you not believe that  this history is being written now? Today, Mandela referred to  the guests at the inauguration, you among them, and said, and I  quote: Not too long ago, we had to fight and in that struggle  many nations helped us, nations represented here today.    [Castro] I believe he said more: Nations which even spilled  their blood.    Yes, I was moved by that part of the speech. We owe a debt  to  history for the possibility of giving, offering, and reflecting  on the essence of everything that has happened in the last 18 or  19 years. It is now 1994 and this began in 1975. Actually, it  began before 1975 with our cooperation with the peoples of  Guinea-Bissau and Angola, who were fighting against Portuguese  colonialism. All in all, it began over 30 years ago.    The main part took place after 1975 when Cuba made a full  commitment, when the Revolution committed itself fully. We have  to point out that our Revolution played all its cards in that  struggle, and more than once. A defeat under those conditions  would have meant the end of the Cuban Revolution.    All this happened after 1975. We have to gather all that  information. We have not yet written the history of the Cuban  Revolution, but one of the most brilliant pages of the history  of the Cuban Revolution was its selfless cooperation and  solidarity with Africa. As someone once said, the leader of  Guinea-Bissau, I remember, Amilcar [Cabral] said: When we are  independent, Cape Verde and Cuba should become a federation.  That is what he said. By this, I mean to say that he had  extraordinary internationalist feelings. He is the one who said  that someday our dead from Angola would rise up to negate the  smear campaigns against Cuba by those who say that Cuba had  ulterior economic and material motives in Angola.    He said those unforgettable words. Amilcar's death was  truly sad. He was assassinated as other leaders have been. It  pains me that (Zamora Machel) was not present in this  celebration. It pains me that Oliver Tambo was not here today.  There were so many people who struggled and deserved to see a  day like today. It is painful to remember that they are no  longer with us. However, we have the consolation of knowing that  their work yielded fruit and is present in all these things we  are seeing.    Well, our history could not have been more selfless, more  supporting, more noble than that we have written in connection  with the peoples of Africa and other parts of the world. I  believe we have been steadfast toward our African heritage, our  cultural heritage, our blood lines; toward our principles of  solidarity with people struggling to gain their independence,  their freedom; toward our principles of commitment to just  causes in this world. We will never regret this. I believe  future generations will always remember this with pride.    However, we must assume full responsibility with history, by  ensuring that it gets written. It is about time to write down  history. Or others will -- and who knows what they would write?    [Unidentified reporter] We have witnessed the burial of  apartheid, yet everyone is filled with happiness and joy; we  experienced it this morning at the inauguration.    [Castro] We have witnessed the burial of apartheid and the  birth of freedom. What we witnessed today is beautiful in the  extreme. One of the most beautiful things we saw was the unity  among the South African people, among every sector, and every  ethnic group. You cannot imagine how much we wish right now that  this process continue developing in that direction.    There are many things remaining in this world to be buried,  however; and it seems the number of undertakers is on the  increase everywhere. We also saw this in Barbados [words  indistinct] irresponsibility which with the world's natural  resources and living conditions are being destroyed. The number  of undertakers of evil is on the increase, as well as the number  of midwives of good.</p>

			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> S.F. HOTELS CUT RATES TO LURE TOURISTS BACK  </P> <P> Room rates at even luxury hotels are falling fast as hoteliers find the  traditionally slow winter months even more sluggish than usual in the wake of  the October earthquake.  </P> <P> The San Francisco Chronicle reported today that rates at many inns have been  slashed by 20% to 40%, and more in some cases.  </P> <P> Observers cite tourists' fears of another earthquake such as the one Oct. 17  that killed 67 people in the San Francisco Bay Area, and an oversupply of hotel  rooms.  </P> <P> The number of hotel rooms in San Francisco increased 7% last year to 27,600,  while occupancy rates dropped to about 70%, the break-even point for the  average hotel. And an additional 1,400 rooms are scheduled to come on the  market later this year.  </P> <P> Hotel officials say business in January and February slipped as much as 10%.  </P> <P> As a result, the Mark Hopkins hotel cut rates 43% to $99 for a limited number  of rooms during the last few months, and is offering spring discounts for the  first time. The Sheraton at the Wharf is offering double-occupancy rooms at $95  a night, rather than its regular $120.  </P> <P> "The competition is so fierce that I'm seeing rates for weekdays that used to  be reserved for weekends only," said Stan Streeter, a hotel analyst with the  accounting firm Pannell Kerr Forster.  </P> <P> Even so, discounts haven't done enough.  </P> <P> HBR Hotels, owner of five San Francisco hotels whose revenues have dropped  about 7%, has changed the way it spends its $120,000 quarterly marketing  budget, opting for brochures targeting Japanese tourists.  </P></p>

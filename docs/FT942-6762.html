			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Pro-business steps on disabled Sir, The debate about civil rights legislation for disabled people has moved to the point where it is not a question of if the bill will be passed, but what kind of bill will enter into British law. The business community has nothing to fear from civil rights legislation for Britain's disabled people. In the US, the Americans with Disabilities Act, passed two years ago, is seen as pro-business - enabling businesses to access new markets, and opening new opportunities, and turning millions of tax-users into tax-payers. When Jack Ashley reintroduces the disabled persons civil rights bill into the House of Lords on June 22, the business community, the government and disabled people, together with their organisations, should come together to discuss new and imaginative ways of making the act work - such as providing tax incentives for smaller businesses. Stuart Etherington, chief executive, Royal National Institute for Deaf People, 105 Gower Street, London WC1E 6AH</p>

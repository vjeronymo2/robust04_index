			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> President Bush, like his predecessor, has begun his presidency with the  approval of a majority of the American people, according to a Gallup poll. Less  than a week after he took office, 51% approve of Bush's job performance while  6% disapprove. High levels of uncertainty are characteristic of early surveys  of incoming presidents, but an exceptionally large number, 43%, have not yet  formed opinions about Bush, the poll said. President Reagan also received a 51%  approval rating early in his tenure. But Reagan left office last month riding  an unprecedented wave of popularity, and the high rate of people undecided on  Bush may reflect some public uncertainty that he can match Reagan.  </P></p>

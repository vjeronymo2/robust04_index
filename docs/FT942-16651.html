			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Switzerland (1): Increasingly awkward position - Despite a resilient economy and a tranquil political scene, the Swiss remain uncertain about their future in a more integrated Europe By any measure, Switzerland is doing pretty well these days. It has a strong currency, a resilient economy, a restored status as a banking centre and a relatively tranquil social and political life. It even has some fresh outside endorsements. The Economist newspaper recently pronounced Switzerland the world's most desirable country in which to live, on the basis of a synthesis of economic, social, cultural and political statistics. And a survey last month by International Survey Research found that Swiss workers were the most satisfied in Europe. This represents quite a change from the late 1980s when a series of unseemly scandals in business and government and uncertainty about European integration were undermining Swiss confidence. But beneath the surface doubts and problems persist. Having decided in a referendum 15 months ago to keep their distance from the European Union, the Swiss remain bemused by the integration process going on around them. They also sense that the strategic assumptions on which they have anchored their policy of armed neutrality for nearly 200 years no longer hold, but they are not sure how they should fit into the post-cold war world. And they are startled by an increasingly raucous tone in their internal political debates, reflected in a sharp polarisation of voting patterns in recent local elections and the tragic inability of all levels of government to agree on a policy for dealing with the country's outsized community of hard drug addicts and dealers. For the moment, though, most Swiss are probably just relieved that things are going as well as they are. In late 1992, as the debate swelled over whether or not the country should join the European Economic Area (EEA), political and business leaders warned of dire consequences - an exodus of industry and a slumping economy - if the EEA was rejected. In the event, the people voted by a small majority to stay out of the expanded free trade area which unites the EU and the countries of the European Free Trade Association (Efta). Yet so far no significant negative consequences can be directly attributed to this decision. On the contrary, there is widespread agreement, even among European integration advocates, that the decision has bolstered Switzerland's previously flagging status as a financial safe haven. New investment funds have poured into the country in the past year at a rate not seen since the early 1970s when the central bank ultimately had to impose negative interest rates to staunch it. While it is true that external events - a new withholding tax in Germany and political turmoil in Italy - provoked these flows, it is also true that much less of it would have come to Switzerland if the country had joined the EEA. The inflow - which in fact began a few months before the EEA vote - enabled the Swiss National Bank to begin lowering interest rates well before other European central banks, and that in turn helped reduce inflation and lay the base for the economic recovery which seems to be getting under way this year. Whether the EEA decision has had any structural impact on Swiss industry remains unclear. Corporate investment has been at a low level anyway, and the rise of unemployment to record levels in the past year is attributable mainly to higher female participation rates and the tendency of guest workers not to return to their countries when they lose their jobs. Nevertheless, there remains an uneasy sense that some day a price will have to be paid for the arrogant decision to remain aloof from the European club  -a sense that was heightened last month when, in another referendum, a majority voted to ban all transit lorry traffic from the Alps from 2004. Swiss authorities may say that this latest decision was motivated entirely by environmental considerations and is in the mainstream of progressive European transportation policy, but neighbouring countries have been offended by this unilateral move and have already threatened retaliation. Planned negotiations later this year between Switzerland and the EU on other air and road transport issues will not be made any easier, and Swissair, the national airline, could find itself unwelcome at some EU airports. The federal government finds itself in an increasingly awkward position on European matters. It is caught between its conviction that integration is essential and inevitable for the country's future welfare and security, and the mood of the Swiss population, which shows no sign of having shifted since the EEA vote. This discomfort was reflected in a foreign policy statement in December which restated the goal of Swiss integration into the European Union, but eschewed setting any timetable for it, for fear of stirring up the Europhobes. The otherwise bland statement did contain one remarkable chapter - devoted to the issue of neutrality. It effectively laid the basis for jettisoning this sacred foundation of Swiss foreign policy, arguing that neutrality was never an end in itself, but merely a means of preserving Swiss independence. The paper suggested that today, when 70 per cent of imports come from EU countries, Swiss independence is threatened more by not having a say in EU policymaking than by any hostile military power. So far, the Swiss have shown little inclination for full debate on strategic policy, but that could change soon. In June they are to vote in a referendum on providing blue helmet troops to United Nations peacekeeping operations, which should refocus attention on strategic issues and the future role of the Swiss military. The country still has one of the largest armies in Europe, with 600,000 men capable of being mobilised within a few hours. The government decided, three years ago, that such a large force was no longer necessary following the collapse of the Soviet empire. From next year, force levels are to be reduced by a third, with whole regiments disappearing. So far, this restructuring has not been accompanied with the howls of protest that greeted similar cutbacks in some other countries, but it could have a big long term social impact. The militia army has long been one of the few unifying forces of Swiss society - the 'Place de la Concorde' where men from all social strata and linguistic groups get to know each other in testing circumstances. Some people fear that the country is already showing signs of losing its delicate cohesion, and that social and political debates are becoming too strident. This has been especially apparent in the Zurich region in recent months, as public anxiety over rising drug crime has mounted. The marginal right wing Swiss People's Party (SVP) seized on this anxiety in recent elections in the country's largest city, campaigning aggressively against the liberal approach of those it sneeringly called 'die Linken und Netten' (the Lefties and the Do-gooders) to the drug problem. The people responded, voting in 19 SVP representatives to the 125 seat city council on March 6, compared with only seven in 1990. It was hardly a coincidence that the federal government, which has dithered over drug policy for years, leapt into action the following week, passing tough new measures to curtail the rights of asylum seekers. Many drug dealers in Zurich are former Yugoslavs who have exploited the asylum law to avoid extradition. Civil rights activists were appalled, and opinion leaders in distant French-speaking cantons grumbled about further proof that the nation was being forced to subordinate its priorities to those of Zurich. It all seems a bit un-Swiss, but it would be wrong to forecast any serious deterioration of the still exceptionally high quality of life in the country. The Swiss are too tough and practical to let that happen.</p>

In politics, this "agility" has enabled him to  slide from one ideology to another without losing face -- or not  too much, at least. The Ukrainian Houdini has elevated the  quick-change act to an art: Secretary of the Communist Party  Central Committee until 1991, he did not say a word in defense  of Gorbachev during the time of the attempted "August coup"; but  after the coup failed he sided with the Ukrainian independence  movement and was elected president by a landslide vote a few  months later . Now he is seeking reelection by flirting with  the communists (he appointed one of them prime minister), but he  is also wooing the moderate nationalists. A man for all seasons  who has the good fortune always to appear like the "lesser  evil," helped by the absence of worthy alternative candidates  and by an unscrupulous exploitation of power.    [Franceschini] During your two-and-a-half years as president  Ukraine has plummeted into an abyss. Do you not feel  responsible?    [Kravchuk] I disagree. Only those who do nothing make no  mistakes. We have made some, but we have also done a great deal  -- building from nothing an independent state, without wars or  disasters, with democratic structures and its own Armed Forces,  earning the respect of the international community. The worst  is over. We have a long way to go, but we are on course, and in  two or three years' time everything will be resolved.    [Franceschini] Are you in favor of forming a Slavic  confederation between Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, as some  people have been suggesting recently?    [Kravchuk] It is a dangerous idea. It could spark a tide of  pan-Slavism and nationalism from Eastern Europe to Kazakhstan,  in all the countries where millions of Slavs live. It is  impossible to create unions on the basis of the ethnic-national  principle. But we do want to have good relations with Russia,  especially in the economic field.    [Franceschini] Crimea and East Ukraine, where 10 million  Russians live, are pressing to return to Russia's orbit. Could  this prompt a conflict between Moscow and Kiev?    [Kravchuk] Russia and Ukraine have lived together for 350  years, have never taken up arms against each other, and will  never do so. To resolve the issue of Crimea's autonomy we will  not resort to force under any circumstances. We are in favor of  a peaceful solution of the problem, and I think we are moving in  this direction.    [Franceschini] Will Ukraine sign the nuclear  nonproliferation  treaty and thus pledge to consign its arsenal to Russia?    [Kravchuk] With me as president, the treaty will be  immediately submitted to Parliament for ratification as soon as  possible. It is an essential duty that we have taken on with  respect to the international community.</p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Manchester United scores 45% advance MANCHESTER United followed up a victory against football championship rivals Norwich City with the announcement yesterday of a 45 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits. Both sets of results helped push up the share price by a further 10p to 412p, a 46 per cent increase in the past six months and 27p ahead of the June 1991 flotation price. With net spending on players reduced by nearly Pounds 2m to Pounds 285,000, pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 4.62m (Pounds 3.17m) in the six months to January 31. The purchase of Dion Dublin and Eric Cantona, for Pounds 1m each, was offset by the sale of Neil Webb, Mark Robins and Mal Donaghy. Before transfer fees and interest income of Pounds 559,000 (Pounds 614,000), operating profit declined to Pounds 4.34m (Pounds 4.79m) on turnover of Pounds 13m (Pounds 12.4m). Mr Martin Edwards, chief executive, said the club had fared less well in cup competitions and played two fewer home games. A breakdown of first-half sales showed a decline in gate receipts and ground advertising. The latter reflects the smaller television audiences for live Premier League football since its switch to BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster. Television, shop and conference income all advanced. Mr Edwards said building work on the Stretford End of the Old Trafford ground had reduced capacity to 33,000 for the first part of the season. This had been offset by price increases averaging 30 per cent. Capacity had gone up to 37,000, yielding Pounds 600,000 per game. Next season it would be 45,000, adding at least 10 per cent to match income even though prices were being held. All 46 of the new stand's executive boxes had been sold for the 1993-94 season. After paying about half the Pounds 10m cost of the stand, United still had Pounds 9.8m (Pounds 12.8m) cash in the bank. Earnings per share rose to 25.8p (17.9p before switching funds from the transer fee reserve and 24p afterwards). The interim dividend is held at 6p. COMMENT With twice as many games in the first half as the second, the bulk of United's 1992-93 profits are already in the bag. But some tantalising variables remain. One is the league championship, worth Pounds 850,000 to the winner and guaranteeing lucrative European football next season. Ironically the bonuses due to champions would make it more immediately profitable to come second or third. On the debit side, the purchase of another star player could keep full-year pre-tax profits flat at about Pounds 5m. This gives a prospective p/e of about 14, a sign that United is at last being taken seriously by the market. It deserves it for strong cash management and the increasingly slick exploitation of its stadium and brand. If it wins the championship the price could rise further, even after a run that would have done Ryan Giggs proud.</p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / People: Sun Alliance board The changing of the top management guard at Sun Alliance Group, Britain's biggest composite insurer, continues apace. Arthur Hayes, 49, general manager in charge of group planning, has been appointed to the main board, as has Peter Taylor, 52, the managing director of Sun Alliance Life. Both men also join the board of the group's principal subsidiary, Sun Alliance and London Insurance. Scott Nelson, 53, general manager responsible for corporate finance, was put on the board in September and the latest additions mean that three of Sun Alliance's seven top executives have joined the board within the past year. Brian Wright retired as an executive director in April, but remains on the board, and Geoffrey Browne and Eric Coward have retired rec-ently. The normal retirement age at Sun Alliance is 62 and if 60-year-old Roger Neville, who has been chief executive since June 1987, follows in his pre-decessor's footsteps, he could be expected to step down over the next year or two. If he did, then the market speculation is that Roger Taylor, 50, who has been an executive director since 1986, would be Neville's obvious successor. ***** Martin Pluck, head of research (UK equities) at Clerical Medical Investment Group, has been appointed a director of CLERICAL MEDICAL MANAGED FUNDS.</p>

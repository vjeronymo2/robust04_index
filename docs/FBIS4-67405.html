			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zhu Baoxia: "Chemical Registration To Stop Deal </F> in Toxins"]    [Text] Chemical traders will have to get environmental  clearance beginning next month before their goods can be  imported or exported, an attempt to combat shipments of toxic  materials.    The National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) must  check all chemicals exiting or entering the country, a switch  from the old system that only required inspection from the  Customs General Administration. NEPA, along with Customs and  the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec)  issued the regulations yesterday. It takes effect on May 1.    The regulations were drafted in response to a UN call to  stamp out unauthorized transfers of toxic chemicals worldwide.    And they are also aimed at protecting the national  environment and the people's health, said Li Hengyuan, deputy  division chief in charge of solid wastes and chemicals in NEPA.    Li said that chemicals play a key role in economic  development and improving people's living standards, but some  cause pollution and major health problems.    The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that about 60  to  90 percent of the known cancer cases are caused by chemicals.    Li said China has experienced rapid development in chemical  production over the past few years which are widely applied in  many fields. Add to this a large number of pesticides imported  for agricultural production.    Customs in Shanghai and Guangzhou alone saw imports of 6  billion yuan (about $700 million) in chemicals in 1993.    Nepa has received numerous reports of chemical accidents in  recent years, Li said.</p>

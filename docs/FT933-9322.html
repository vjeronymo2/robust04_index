			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / International Company News: PepsiCo plans Dollars 500m investment in Poland PEPSICO, the US soft drinks, restaurants and snack foods group, plans to invest about Dollars 500m in Poland over the next five years. The money - which PepsiCo claims is one of the largest single investment programmes by a consumer products company in Poland - will go into a range of businesses. On the restaurant side, it intends to open Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and '3-in-1' outlets in Warsaw and other cities. The '3-in-1' outlets combine the three PepsiCo chains - KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell - under one roof. The US group also plans to open a new salty snack plant at Grodzisk; to broaden its local beverage distribution; and to upgrade and expand bottling facilities. The company also said it planned to raise its stake in Wedel, the Polish chocolate, biscuit and confectionery products company, to 70 per cent by 1994. The US group acquired a 40 per cent interest in Wedel in 1991. It added that it expected sales of PepsiCo-related businesses in Poland to top Dollars 100m this year, and to reach more than Dollars 600m by the end of the decade.</p>

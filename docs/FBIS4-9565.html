			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Gligorov: The Language Problem -- An </F> Internal Question"]    [Text] "It is not our issue, it is their internal  question," President Gligorov stated last night at the Skopje  airport, upon his return from the two day official visit to  Bulgaria, in his retrospective on the problem with the failure  to sign any agreements because of the disputed formulation  "Macedonian language."    "The Bulgarian Government made several remarks that will  have  to be reviewed by both sides, however, the problem is the  formulation of the Macedonian language," said Gligorov.    "Our stance is clear -- the Macedonian language cannot be  controversial and it is not up for negotiations. These are two  completely different languages and I think that we will make  some progress in further talks."    Gligorov feels that President Zhelev has an understanding  for  this matter, it is simply a reality that has to be accepted like  any other reality.</p>

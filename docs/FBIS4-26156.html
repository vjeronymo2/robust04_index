			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News at 8:00"] </F>   [Text] One person is confirmed dead and 60 injured after a  Hong Kong-owned textile factory collapsed in Zhuhai this  afternoon. Up to 40 people are still thought trapped beneath the  rubble of the building, which was being cleaned up after being  gutted by fire.    The factory is owned by a Hong Kong-China joint venture and  is estimated to have employed around 1,500 workers. What  remains of it now is mostly rubble. The gutted remains of the  building were being searched by around 200 workers and firemen,  making sure the fire was completely extinguished and starting to  move out cloth and textile materials. At about 1400 it's  believed that heavy rains started to fall, weakening the  structure still standing. Shortly afterwards, the remaining  walls came crashing down, trapping around 100 people. Sixty of  them are said to have been taken to hospital, suffering  injuries. A spokeswoman at Zhuhai's People Hospital described  the situation there as very busy. One person is confirmed dead;  about 40 others are still thought to be trapped under the rubble.    The fire at the factory began at around 1700 yesterday  afternoon, and spread quickly through the six-story building  located close to the Macao border. It was put out around four  hours later at 2100.    The question authorities will now be asking is why workers  and firemen went back into the building if the structure was  unsafe.</p>

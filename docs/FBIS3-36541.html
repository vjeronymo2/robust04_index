			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 7 TASS -- Yegor Gaydar, former  Russian first vice-premier and currently leader of the "Russia's  Choice" parliamentary faction, said that on Wednesday [9  February], the State Duma will, apparently, discuss problems  connected with scheduled elections to local bodies of power and  a draft of permanent rules of procedure, adding that at  present, the Duma works according to temporary rules of  procedure.    Gaydar pointed out that continuous debates in parliament  were  caused by a draft resolution "On Amnesty in Connection With the  Adoption of the Constitution of the Russian Federation." The  draft resolution on amnesty was submitted to parliament for  approval by President Boris Yeltsin. The Duma decided to return  the draft resolution to parliamentary commissions and committees  for thorough consideration since it caused a different reaction  at a session of the Duma council. Explaining the position of  the Russia's Choice bloc on this matter, Gaydar said that "we  asked the president not to submit the resolution to the Duma, on  the grounds of the existing criminal situation in the country  and inadequate interpretation of the problem."    The Duma council also discussed the appointment of the Duma  chief of staff. According to Gaydar, chairman of the lower  house of the Russian parliament, Ivan Rybkin, was suggested to  select one of three candidates planned to be given the post and  express his opinion at a session of the Duma council. Gaydar  did not say exactly, but merely mentioned that the Russia's  Choice bloc supports the candidacy of Vladimir Podoprigora.  However, Podoprigora cannot be relieved of his duties yet as  chairman of the Federation Council's Committee for International  Affairs, which is regarded by many deputies as a serious  obstacle preventing his appointment to the post.    According to Gaydar, the Duma council did not discuss recent  developments in former Yugoslavia. However, he added that  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is expected to make a statement on this  problem at a plenary session of the Duma on Wednesday.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Izudin Durakovic from Gracanica] </F>   [Text] Over the last few days the chetniks have been  intensively shelling the defense lines and civilian targets in  the theater of operations of Operative Group Gracanica.  Yesterday they shelled Malesici, Gracanica, Brijesnica,  Klokotnica, Lukavica, and Lukavac. They tried to infiltrate a  sabotage group into the village of [word indistinct] but it was  intercepted in time and forced to disperse. The enemy has also  been intensively moving its armored and mechanized forces,  concentrating them mostly toward the defense lines in the the  117th Lukavac Brigade's theater of operations.    During all this, the Serbian media keeps broadcasting  unscrupulous lies intended to keep up the shaky morale of the  chetniks. The Serbian media keeps talking about the clashes for  Vijenac, and the chetnik's successful defense of this  strategically important point. The truth, however, is that  Vijenac has been under the control of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Army for three days now, following a fierce counteroffensive  when it captured Vijenac after just a few hours of fighting.  Five more villages, stretching across some 9 square km, were  liberated in the process. In this operation -- which was  carried out in accordance with the strictest military criteria  -- the Lilies [Bosnia-Herzegovina Army soldiers] of [Commander]  Osman Puskar and the 119th Brigade captured 21 chetniks, and  killed twice as many. As a result of this battle, the Serbian  aggressor again violated the arms embargo against our forces,  leaving our army better equipped by a T-34 tank, a  self-propelled gun, eight mortars, a (PSP-type) Vis, four  antiaircraft machine guns, three antiaircraft guns, and lots  more besides.    In retaliation for this defeat on the front, the enemy has  indiscriminately [words indistinct] of all calibers on civilian  targets. However, this will not check our fighters in their  defense leading to final liberation from the chetnik phalanx.</p>

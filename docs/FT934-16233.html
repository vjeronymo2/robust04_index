			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Building society rebuked over sales of bonds THE North of England Building Society may have to pay some Pounds 500,000 compensation to clients after receiving the first public reprimand issued by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog. The SIB censured the society yesterday for failing to ensure that its independent financial advisers sold suitable products to clients. It is the first such reprimand by the SIB against any of the 77 firms it regulates directly. The building society said that, as a result, it may have to pay compensation to up to half the 2,000 customers it has advised since 1987, at a cost of roughly Pounds 500,000. The SIB's charges against North of England, the UK's 20th largest building society, deal mainly with its sale of so-called single-premium bonds and its advice to people to transfer from their existing pension arrangements. Single-premium bond investors pay a lump sum for a fixed term and earn higher returns. But cashing in single-premium bonds before their maturity date leads to a penalty. Mr David Hodgson, the society's secretary and solicitor, said that although there were inspection visits in earlier years, they had lasted no longer than a day. But last September, inspectors announced they intended to conduct a much more intensive review of records. That review, which focused on 600 client files, turned up enough instances of mis-selling to prompt inquiries into the files of the society's entire 2,000 clients. 'We could be looking at remedial action on 1,000 cases,' Mr Hodgson said. North of England ceased giving independent advice from last Friday and is now acting as a 'tied agent' selling the products of General Accident exclusively. The SIB does not have authority to set fines for firms which break its rules, unlike the self-regulatory organisations (SROs) which oversee the bulk of the financial services industry. Firms not wishing to join an SRO have been able to seek direct supervision by the SIB. The SIB said that while it has privately disciplined firms before, this is the first case where it believed public action was warranted. Firms in the retail financial services industry have complained that direct regulation by SIB, chosen mostly by banks and building societies, is a 'soft option' because it is less rigorous than action by SROs. Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, has said he wishes to withdraw from direct regulation completely and has urged creation of a new self-regulatory body, the Personal Investment Authority, which will include many firms now supervised by SIB.</p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Leading Article: How to grab the EC money BRITAIN'S attempt to place itself 'at the heart of Europe' is falling foul of a severe case of clogged arteries. The European Commission is threatening to withhold funds for hard-hit industrial areas unless the Treasury comes up with more transparent accounting procedures for regional spending. The long-running row has already held up Pounds 100m earmarked for depressed coal-mining areas, with a further Pounds 900m potentially blocked. The sums form a sizeable component of the money the UK is entitled to receive from Brussels to reduce its considerable net contribution to the Community. Since the dispute has already intruded into the general election campaign, the government has every incentive to get itself off this particular EC spending hook as quickly as possible. At one level, the wrangling is about whether the UK Treasury needs any advice from Brussels on where to direct British public spending. This is not, however, an argument about the Commission intervening in every 'nook and cranny' of British life. The Treasury is being asked, after all, to adapt its public spending regime to conform with EC regulations on good budgetary housekeeping, to which Britain gave its assent in 1988. Greater control More fundamentally, the disagreement raises the question of whether the highly-centralised British system for distributing public-sector funds really serves the country's best interests. There are good arguments in favour of Britain's giving local councils greater control over raising the resources which they are responsible for distributing. This would allow them to forge constructive links with Brussels, under guidelines worked out with Whitehall, to gain maximum advantage from the single market. Excessive British centralisation runs counter to developments in other more successful EC countries, above all Germany. In the short term, the issue is whether the Treasury can prove to the satisfaction of the Commission that EC regional funding adds to money which would have been spent anyway. The Commission says that this 'additionality' principle is necessary to ensure that aid is channelled towards genuinely eligible regions, rather than simply used to reimburse spending which would otherwise be financed domestically. Britain has always agreed with the argument in theory. But it claims that identifying the supplementary nature of funding on a project-by-project basis raises intractable difficulties for control of public spending. Pedantic rules Britain may have a case in pointing out that the Commission's pedantic spending rules are more applicable to countries such as Italy or Greece with less developed internal financial procedures. But this argument misses the main point: Britain is failing to avail itself of resources available under a scheme originally set up, at least in part, to defray the costs of Britain's EC membership. The Department of the Environment has put forward several possible solutions. The simplest - redefining public spending planning totals to exclude Regional Development Fund grants - may prove too radical for the Treasury. The government should still be able to provide a spending breakdown which would satisfy most of the Commission's requirements - even though this might require reallocation of funds among other British regional programmes. Yesterday's news that the EC has cleared Pounds 18m in aid to Northern Ireland appears encouraging. The Commission says that the particular system for allocating funds in the province provides the necessary 'transparency' - raising the question of why the Treasury cannot adopt such a system for the rest of the UK. Failure to end the impasse would cause hardship and disillusionment in the local authorities involved. More widely, it would be a setback for Britain's overall commitment to get value for money from the EC. A country which has laboured for years to achieve greater financial equity in its dealings with the Community should not now stumble over self-imposed hurdles.</p>

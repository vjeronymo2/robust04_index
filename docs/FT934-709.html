			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / People: Bond surfaces at Bullough Gordon Bond, who resigned earlier this month from Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the Franco-British paper group, after a boardroom row, has been snapped up by Bullough, the office products and refrigeration group. Bond, whose resignation as chief executive of AWA's printing and writing division disappointed institutional investors and sent the stock tumbling, has been appointed chief executive at Bullough. Bob Steel, who had been Bullough's managing director since 1988, is leaving the company after 17 years. Although in July the group announced sharply lower interim pre-tax profits, it has since then been widely viewed as a recovery stock and its share price, which jumped 13p to 150p yesterday, has been reaching 12-month highs. The group confirmed that the operating profit, before exceptional items, is expected to be above the level of last year 'by a useful margin'. Bond, 52, joins Bullough after 10 years with Rank Xerox and 10 years at AWA. He has wide experience as a director of manufacturing and marketing organisations in all main European countries as well as the US. At AWA he managed a European division between 1984 and 1988 and then the US Appleton operations; he increased profits every year for nine consecutive years and was widely regarded as one of AWA's most successful operational directors.</p>

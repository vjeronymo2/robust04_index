			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, 25 Jun (KUNA) -- Aden describes the latest  cease-fire announced by Sanaa as "a lie," and warned that it  will not stay with its hands tied facing the continued attacks  launched by the northern forces on the southern city for a third  successive day.    In the first reaction by the South, 'Abd al-Rahaman  al-Jafri,  the vice president of the Democratic Republic of Yemen as  declared in the South, said that Sanaa's fifth declared  cease-fire "is a new lie to the international community at a  time when the U.S. Administration has announced its clear  position vis-a-vis the continued bombardment of Aden."    In an exclusive interview to KUNA, Al-Jafri said that the  South is awaiting the decisions of the international community  to save it from annihilation by the North.    He added, however, "if the international community and  particularly the Security Council proves to be incapable, then  the South has the capability of dealing a decisive and strong  response to destroy northern areas so that 'Ali Abdallah Salim  will realise the meaning of shelling Aden and killing its  children and women." [passage omitted]    The city is in total darkness because electricity power  supplies have been cut as a result of the northern forces'  shelling today which hit the main electricity generation station  as well as the radio station.</p>

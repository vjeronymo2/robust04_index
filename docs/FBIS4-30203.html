			<p>BFN     [Text] The military has issued a "Defence White Paper"  detailing its strategic policies and explaining why it needs a  huge budget, an unprecedented move that precedes a forthcoming  parliamentary debate on the national budget.    The document, prepared by the Defence Ministry and the  Supreme Command headquarters, was presented yesterday to  reporters and participants of a seminar organized by the  National Defence College.    Addressing the seminar on the "Military Role in National  Defence and Development", Supreme Commander Woranat Aphichari  said information in the Defence White Paper was not new but it  had not been publicized before.    "We have just never disclosed it before, which made people  think soldiers lived in a closed society," Woranat told national  security psychology students and journalists attending the  seminar.    "The situation has changed. To foster the democratic system  in which we have faith, it is time to publicize this kind of  information. This will make people understand the military more,  and support our role. Some people's lingering doubts about the  military's role will also be cleared up," he said.    Another reason for disclosing information in the white paper  is to show "our neighbours that we have nothing to hide, that  every defence strategy is based on our non-aggression policy,"  Woranat added.    The White Paper is divided into four main topics --  International and Regional Security, Basic National Strategy,  Defence Strategy and the Thai Military in the Future.    In the section on international and regional security, the  military expresses concern over the nuclear tension on the  Korean Peninsula and the Spratly Islands conflicts involving  China, Vietnam, Taiwan, the Philippines and Malaysia.    The paper says the United States will continue to play an  active military and political role to maintain peace in the  region.    It mentions India's "increasing military capacity", covering  possession of nuclear weaponry, effective air logistics and  transport, and a formidable navy. The paper says India's naval  strength has caught up with that of China.    The document also predicts that neighbouring Burma, with  support from Beijing, will soon have a highly efficient  military. According to the paper, Burma now has more than  300,000 soldiers and has been procuring tanks, artillery and  rocket launchers. The Burmese navy is also embarking on an  expansion programme to protect oil and gas exploration.    The section on basic national strategy mentions attempts to  improve Thai politics, "which needs to be carried out sincerely".    The third section says Thailand needs a sophisticated air  defence, covering surveillance, patrol, intelligence and alarm  systems.    In the section on future facing the Thai armed forces, the  document says that to defend the country's borders, "enormous  manpower and budget are required".    "We need to set up compact fast-moving teams with compact  and  effective weapons, to defend several major spots at the borders.  Tanks and armoured vehicles must be efficient and suited to the  frontier geography," it says.    The 1995 national budget allocates Bt131 billion for  national  defence and security, a five per cent increase on fiscal 1994.    Woranat told the seminar that the country's defence budget  for the next fiscal year had been trimmed by about Bt50 billion.    The paper says Thailand's defence budget is relatively small  compared with other ASEAN countries.    "We have to explain our needs and programmes to the public.  That is why we are disclosing this White Paper information,"  Woranat said.    He added, however, that the military was satisfied with the  final figures in the Budget Bill, which is to be deliberated by  Parliament early next month.    Parliament President Marut Bunnak said the bill could be  listed for debate on July 6 and 7.    If the debate cannot be concluded within the dates set, an  extra afternoon, on Friday, July 8, will be set aside for it.  The proceedings will be televised live, he said.    Marut thought the bill would get the backing of the Phalang  Tham Party and would get through the House, despite the  coalition's internal problems.</p>

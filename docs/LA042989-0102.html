			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEGACY OF A VISIONARY;  </P> <P> HISTORIC BANNING MANSION SETS GROUNDWORK FOR FLOWER SHOW  </P> <P> Almost everyone who came to California during the mining boom caught "gold  fever," but Phineas Banning did not. . . . He had visions of greater things.  </P> <P>  -- Oliver Vickery, "Harbor Heritage"  </P> <P> A California historical treasure sits peacefully in a quiet residential  neighborhood in Wilmington just south of Pacific Coast Highway.  </P> <P> The 24-room Greek Revival-style mansion is almost as much an incongruous  surprise today as it must have been in 1864, when Phineas Banning hired ships'  carpenters to build it amid marshes, muddy tide flats and one-story adobes.  </P> <P> Banning, a visionary who launched the beginnings of what became Los Angeles  harbor, built the house as a homage to his native Wilmington, Del., after  amassing a sizable fortune as "the transportation king" of Southern California  with a  </P> <P> stagecoach company, wagon manufacturing and a shipping business. Banning also  built the first railroad in Southern California and served in the state Senate.  </P> <P> The Banning Residence Museum, widely recognized as the finest 19th-Century  Greek Revival house in Southern California, was occupied by three generations  of the Banning family before the City of Los Angeles purchased the property in  1927.  </P> <P> The house, which sits in the middle of a 20-acre city park, remained dormant  for many years, but a full-scale restoration began in 1976.  </P> <P> Today it has been returned to its original Victorian elegance. Furnishings and  artifacts have been painstakingly selected to represent the styles popular  during Banning's lifetime, including 42 pieces of furniture original to the  house.  </P> <P> This fine old house will look especially resplendent next Saturday and Sunday  from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., when the works of 17 professional florists are  displayed there as part of Floriade II, a flower and horticulture show. The  event is presented by Friends of Banning Park and is a benefit for the museum.  Admission is $6 per person. Children 12 and younger are admitted free.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Themed Floral Design  </P> <P> Each of the florists has decorated a room, using the house and its artifacts as  a backdrop for a themed floral design. Meanwhile, a competitive  flower-arranging display will be held in the basement orientation room,  surrounded by huge photographs showing the development of the harbor.  </P> <P> Outside, landscape designers have created a colorscape in a sunken garden area  near the main gate featuring flowers of the season. Nearby in the newly  restored coach barn, a competitive horticulture show includes the best of  Southern California plants and flowers.  </P> <P> "Between the lectures, demonstrations, competitions and the innovative and  creative displays produced by the region's top floral designers and  landscapers, Floriade II brings together in one place all the elements  necessary to create and maintain a beautiful garden," says Donna Gibbs, event  chairman.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Additional Attractions  </P> <P> The competitive shows are being coordinated by the Costa Verde District  California Garden Clubs Inc. Members of the Long Beach, San Pedro and Hermosa  garden clubs, the Gardeniers of Palos Verdes and the Riviera Garden Club of  Torrance are participating.  </P> <P> Two special lectures are an added attraction. Artist and author Fleur Cowles of  London will present "The Life and Time of the Rose" at 11:30 a.m. next  Saturday. Then at 2 p.m., James Goslee, a New York floral designer and author,  will discuss "Living With Flowers," followed by Nancy Goslee Powers, former  editor of House Beautiful, addressing "Intimate Gardens." The lectures are an  additional $15 each.  </P> <P> A boutique will feature garden furniture and accessories, gardening books,  botanical prints, topiary trees, orchids, unusual plant containers, dried  floral arrangements and Victorian-themed paper items and books.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New England Influence  </P> <P> Gibbs, who became involved with the museum about eight years ago, says: "I love  this part of (the) history of Los Angeles because I'm a native and I think so  many people have a concept of Los Angeles as all Hispanic heritage, and they've  lost sight of the New England influence. It's really developed into the great  city that it has because of people like Banning."  </P> <P> "He (Banning) was a visionary man," Zoe Bergquist, museum director, agrees. "He  had a vision that the area would make a magnificent harbor. There was quite a  conflict between (Collis P.) Huntington, who wanted the harbor in Santa Monica,  and Phineas Banning, who wanted the harbor here . . . but Phineas Banning won  out.  </P> <P> "He really opened up the passages which are today's freeways," Bergquist  continues. "Banning, Calif., for instance, is named after him and that was one  of the stagecoach stops. . . . He was an expert at driving what they called the  six-in-hand (stagecoach)."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Overflowing With Guests  </P> <P> In the book "Harbor Heritage," Oliver Vickery, a historian and curator emeritus  of the Banning mansion, wrote: "The history of San Pedro and Wilmington,  California, is the history of Phineas Banning. When Banning arrived on the  scene in 1851, the state was just one year old, and California needed creative  imagination, guidance and leadership."  </P> <P> In Banning's day, this house usually was full of guests. He loved to entertain.  The house was the site of patriotic festivities on Washington's birthday and  the Fourth of July, in addition to many commercial and political meetings. In  spite of his Eastern upbringing, Banning enjoyed California barbecuing, and  frijoles were served from a pot so large that it was stirred with a shovel.  </P> <P> Banning also was fond of addressing his friends from a second-story porch  during such festivities, and was said to have had a voice "loud enough to be  heard beyond the hills."  </P> <P> During more formal dinner parties, the dining room was used. One of Banning's  contemporaries wrote of him: "No man in our state has given so many banquets  and balls, dinners and receptions as he."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Treasures in Residence  </P> <P> In memory of those days, treasures abound in the restored mansion. There's a  delicately carved rosewood American Rococo Revival parlor suite by Joseph Meeks  from mid-19th Century, Banning's American Eastlake roll-top desk of walnut and  mahogany, massive mahogany bookcases full of collections of Charles Dickens and  other 19th-Century writers, a wicker baby buggy with metal wheels, an ornate  claw-footed tub in the bathroom (added in 1876) and Banning's own massive bed  with a veneer of Cuban mahogany. These are just a few of the pieces that create  a real feeling for what life must have been like in the Banning household.  </P> <P> "Each room is done in a different decade," Bernice Klohr, chairman of the  Banning Residence Museum Volunteers, says. "You'll never see a piece of  furniture dated after the decade of the room. It's always before or for the  time period."  </P> <P> The dining room, for instance, is furnished with Phineas Banning's mahogany  dinner table, which is surrounded by reproductions of Chippendale chairs. The  table is set with crystal, Banning family silverware and English Imari  ironstone ware in an Oriental design popular in the latter part of the 19th  Century. An American Eastlake walnut sideboard (circa 1870), carved with fruit,  fowl and wild game displays several pieces of silver.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'The Home Economist'  </P> <P> In the upstairs kitchen, a black Garland stove with ornate silver-colored trim  sits across from a soapstone sink and a zinc-covered work table. The stove  originally was wood-burning, but was converted to gas in the early 1880s. In  Banning's day, the kitchen also featured the latest gadgets, such as apple  peelers, bean slicers, cabbage graters and "the home economist," a black metal  cabinet used to store flour, coffee, tea and other staples.  </P> <P> Just outside the house is what once was the old milk house. It is now restored  as a late-19th-Century schoolhouse. Slates, chalk and McGuffey's Readers are  neatly arranged atop the desks, and a photo of Abraham Lincoln hangs on one  wall. During school tours of the mansion, children are able to experience a day  in the life of a child of the 1800s, including sack races.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Groups by Appointment  </P> <P> The Banning "interpreters" are carefully prepared to provide accurate  information during such tours. Training includes a four-month history course  with speakers on such topics as decorative arts, architecture, textiles and  history. Group tours are by appointment, but the house is open to the public  for tours Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 12:30, 1:30  and 2:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Just a short walk from the schoolhouse is the coach barn, which has been under  restoration for several years.  </P> <P> The Friends of Banning Park will use funds from Floriade II to further equip  the barn, restore Banning family vehicles, produce a video on the development  of transportation in Southern California, restore historic aspects of the  gardens and continue to preserve this fascinating slice of early history.  </P> <P>  Banning Residence Museum, 401 E. M St., Wilmington, off Avalon Boulevard, just  south of Pacific Coast Highway. Information: (213) 548-7777.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Japan in the Dock as Nuclear Criminal" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 22 (KCNA) -- The recent discovery of  a large quantity of nuclear material in Japan evidently shows  once again that her design for nuclear armament has gone to  extremes, notes NODONG SINMUN in a commentary today.    The news analyst says:    The Japanese reactionaries invented a "nuclear suspicion"  about the DPRK and have acted as if they were a "nuclear judge".  Expressing dissatisfaction at the adequate inspections of the  DPRK, they have resorted to pressure demanding a "special  inspection", an "additional inspection" and kicked up a row in  an effort to make the United Nations impose "sanctions" on the  DPRK.    They even prepared an "emergency legislative arrangement"  for  a dispatch of their "self-defence forces" to the Korean  peninsula, talking about "response" in case the UN should adopt  a resolution on "sanctions".    The recent discovery of plutonium kept in hiding made it all  the clearer why Japan has been so hell bent on false propaganda  about "nuclear suspicion" on the DPRK.    It is, indeed, a mean intrigue that Japan has engaged in  hostile acts against the DPRK, spreading a groundless lie to  brand it as a nuclear criminal, while keeping a large quantity  of nuclear weapons- grade material in hiding.    Japan, a nuclear criminal, has tried desperately to place  others in the dock as a nuclear criminal, but she herself has to  sit in it.    Japan must stop at once her intrigues to do harm to the DPRK  over the "nuclear issue", clearly declare to the international  community the total amount of plutonium concealed nationwide and  give up her nuclear armament.</p>

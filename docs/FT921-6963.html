			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Baker pledges police reforms - Law and order THE Tories would enter the election committed to more effective local policing through re-organisation within police forces, Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, promised yesterday as the Tories sought to broaden the canvas of issues on which they claim Labour cannot be trusted. Mr Baker said that the manifesto would include a move to 'sector policing' in which smaller command units are under the control of a local chiefs of police who would stay in the post for longer than at present. He said the change, which has been pioneered in Surrey, would be 'as major a change as my education reforms and the health reforms are'. 'We are concerned with the effectiveness of the police,' he said, emphasising the Citizen's Charter proposals for forces to publish performance standards in areas such as response times to emergency calls, and a greater role for lay people in the police inspectorate. Law and order has come to the fore as an election issue over the past few days, with Labour re-launching its policies last Friday and renewing its attack on the Tories over the record crime figures at a press conference today. 'The Labour party remains soft-headed and flabby on an issue which requires toughness and no compromise,' Mr Baker insisted. Mr Roy Hattersley, shadow home secretary, said Mr Baker wanted to talk about 'imagined shortcomings of the Labour party because he is terrified of discussing the 13-year record of failure, the doubling of recorded crime from 2.5m to over 5m'.</p>

What are the differences between the generation  that produced the process and the generation that inherited it?    [Robaina] Rather than talking about different generations --  since we are all engaged in a single project -- I would rather  talk about a continuing generation, a generation that is aware  of the many things that we have inherited. The project can be  improved. I believe no one will accept living in a society in  which everything has already been done.    [Martinez] Let us say you belong to a generation that had no  choice but to accept what the regime said, a generation that was  raised within the regime, and that today still has to accept it.    [Robaina] It is true that when we were born, many questions  had already been answered; I feel sincerely grateful for this.  I believe my entire generation agrees. I believe that, after  34 years, some answers must be updated, and that this updating  should be done by all those who have an opinion. We have to  answer new questions, and no one wants to be outside the design  of the answers.    [Martinez] To make things clearer, are you and your  generation part of the sector that still defends this process?    [Robaina] We share what has already been accomplished and  what must be preserved at any cost. Some things must be  modified to preserve the achievements that we deem essential.  There are also many things that still have to be accomplished,  a task in which everyone has a chance to participate.    [Martinez] Tell us about your position. How would you define  Cuba's situation today? South Americans think it is complex.    [Robaina] It is complex not just for South Americans but for  the entire world. The situation is complex. I do not like to  make promises or talk about nonexisting prospects. The Cuban  situation is very complex because it is not just a matter of  salvaging or not salvaging. The problem is how to salvage the  project we are fighting for in the midst of so many pressures  and harassments.    [Martinez] It is obvious that you are speaking about the  U.S.  blockade. The question is: Do you think the blockade is the  sole cause of Cuban problems?    [Robaina] No one can have any doubt that it is the single  most important cause of all our difficulties. But to say that  the blockade is the only cause of our problems would be untrue.  The blockade is relative to the new situation, because with the  resources we now have it is much more difficult to achieve what  we would like to achieve regarding trade, exchange, and other  things. We must also admit that a group of solutions in the  purely economic field have not yielded good results. They did  not produce the required results. There is a combination of  many things, without doubt.    [Martinez] Among the many mistaken economic factors it is  almost impossible to omit Cuba's absolute link with the former  Soviet Union...    [Robaina] Without doubt. We paid a dear price for copying  from them mechanisms that had nothing to do with our  idiosyncrasy, our culture, or our traditions. But in order to  fully understand this point we must not forget the blockade or  our own problems.    [Martinez] I would prefer to continue to talk about the  former Soviet Union. Do you accept that the link established at  that time was a mistake?    [Robaina] There are many things that benefited us, and we  cannot cover the sun with one finger. There are many things for  which our people must be grateful to those who helped us save  the project. The fact that the Cuban project is still alive is  proof that we did not produce a mechanical copy. For the past  four or five years the entire world has been thinking that it is  Cuba's turn to fall because the world surrounding the USSR has  already collapsed. We must change and adapt, but the single  fact that we exist is proof that Cuba is not the same thing.  Countries that made an exact and mechanical copy of the old  system collapsed with it.    [Martinez] Yet while accepting it was a general  mistake...there seems to be an inclination to establish a  similar link with Beijing.    [Robaina] Our project started to lose the moment we moved  away from our own reality. Today we are happy to be much closer  to our roots. We are not going to stumble twice at the same  hurdle. I do not think we should copy anything.    [Martinez] Let us now talk about domestic issues. There is  an excess of money in the streets, a flourishing black market,  and dollarization is obvious everywhere.    [Robaina] The most important thing is how to defend our  project. There is a very difficult and complex situation out  there. We must fight the excess of currency. We must face the  consequences for lifting the penalty on the use of hard  currency. In any other part of the world the situation would  have been confronted with neoliberal measures, where the  people's opinion does not count. We do not want to act that way.    [Martinez] But sometime you will have to act...    [Robaina] These are new things for us. For 35 years we have  been engaged in other measures and another project. I think no  one, not even our people, would forgive us if we decided to  implement measures to solve the economic deficit at the cost of  imposing sacrifice on the people.    [Martinez] You talk about sacrifice for the people. By the  way, there are continuous rumors in Havana that sacrifice is  imposed on the common people while political and military  leaders live without any scarcities or without making any  sacrifices... and there are even stronger rumors that some  people live better every day in Cuba, but they are not the ones  who walk the streets...    [Robaina] There is no doubt that during any difficult moment  for any people -- not just due to the internal situation, but  also due to foreign hostility -- people sow all types of  discord. We are convinced that if anything has characterized  our leaderships, it is the manner in which they live, suffer,  and share the people's needs. It is true that some people took  advantage of certain circumstances and that there were cases of  corruption and privileges. When that happened there was an  immediate and strong response, and the whole world is aware of  the measures adopted. Today, as ever, we must share  responsibilities and sacrifices.    [Martinez] It is difficult to understand how, in the midst  of  gasoline rationing, the streets are shared by new, very  powerful, gasoline-consuming official vehicles and thousands of  bicycles...    [Robaina] Cheap egalitarianism does not lead anywhere. If  the decisions that are to be made are made at the speed of a  bicycle we will never leave a period that we must leave.    [Martinez Soto] What are the prospects for better relations  with the United States, a vital issue for the end of the 20th  century?    [Robaina] I do not see reasons for an excess of enthusiasm.  I think the only motivation is that the current administration  does not use the same aggressive language as previous  administrations. And that is something. This alone will not  solve the problem; just because there is no aggressive language  it does not mean the blockade has not been intensified. The  problem here is one of mutual respect --not just with the United  States but with anyone -- for the establishment of normal  relations. We will not sit at a negotiating table as  subordinates. We believe, however, that there are positive  talks. There are joint actions against drug trafficking, there  are contacts among coast guards, and there are talks on a  telecommunications deal. We can agree that neither Latin  America nor Cuba are priorities in U.S. foreign policy. The  current administration is already thinking about the possibility  of reelection and the Cuban issue is very complicated for its  domestic policy because it can jeopardize some votes.  Unfortunately that is the situation.    [Martinez] Finally, an aspect that refers to Uruguay as a  Latin American nation. Cuba played an essential role in  supporting guerrilla movements that developed against our  democracies. Today, although that period has ended, what  guarantees are there for present governments that Cuba will no  longer intervene?    [Robaina] Things happen at a given time and in response to a  given moment. I am certain that today there are conditions in  many countries of the continent, through negotiations and  officially established channels, to enable all movements to  express themselves. Cuba is not currently working, because that  system does not work now, on anything to stimulate situations  that might worry anyone. I think everyone knows to what extent  true peace exists and to what extent we maintain it through the  channels which are increasingly being imposed in our current  times: negotiation, participation, and discussion. America is  experiencing that process and Cuba is participating, above  everything else.    [Martinez] What are your projections for Cuban foreign  policy  in 1994?    [Robaina] I think we cannot theorize very much here.  Projections must be based on a future of much work. The Foreign  Ministry's objective, today, is to take to the world the image  of our project. I do not want to give merely a good image -- I  want to give the real Cuban image, with its good, average, and  bad things. I do not want to be placed on the defendant's seat  in court where every opinion will be heard except ours. Cuba  must not go to the world just to answer questions; it also has  many questions to ask.</p>

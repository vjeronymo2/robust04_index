			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / US boosts Gulf airpower as Iraq hints at retreat: UK to send marines, six fighters and a destroyer President Bill Clinton early today boosted US airpower to 350 warplanes for defending Kuwait and backing up US ground forces, in spite of Baghdad's claim it was pulling troops back from the Gulf state's border. In a televised address President Clinton, who cancelled a trip to New Jersey, to deal with the crisis, said there was no evidence that Iraq's President Saddam Hussein had redeployed his 80,000 troops from the border. 'We are interested in facts, not promises . . . we will not allow Saddam Hussein to defy the will of the US and the international community,' he said in a stern message to Iraq. The President's announcement of an increase in military aircraft came several hours after a DC-10 aircraft disgorged into Kuwait the first 300 US troops of a 36,000-strong US ground force bound for the Gulf state. The decision to send as many as 350 tactical aircraft, including F-15 fighters and B-52 bombers, along with the aircraft carrier USS George Washington group and dozens of other naval vessels, makes it the biggest US military deployment in the Middle East since the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Britain, which has already sent a frigate to the Gulf, said it was planning to send 800 marines, six Tornado fighters and a destroyer, HMS Cardiff, in the next 24 hours unless it was clear a withdrawal had taken place. Amid rising international calls for Baghdad to reverse its deployment Iraq's foreign minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf, and its UN ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, both said Iraqi forces were pulling back from Kuwait's border to positions north of the southern city of Basra. 'The troops are already on the move,' Mr Hamdoon said late yesterday. However, the US Defence Department said it had no confirmation of the claimed withdrawal and would continue its military buildup. 'In fact, it's the opposite. More have been moving in,' a senior official said. UN and Kuwaiti officials, meanwhile, reported the Kuwait-Iraq border to be relatively calm though UN observers in the 15km demilitarised zone straddling the frontier said thousands of people, claimed by Iraq to be stateless Arabs displaced from Kuwait during the Gulf war, continued to assemble from the Iraqi side in a 'tent city' just north of the zone. They have been demanding the right to return to Kuwait. Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said that by yesterday Iraq had deployed, or was moving, up to 80,000 troops near the Kuwait border. 'We believe there are two Republican Guard divisions either already at the border or nearly there, and a third one, which is in the northern part of the country, is on the move now, and we expect it will be going to the border as well.' Iraq's deployment was apparently aimed at pressing the UN Security Council to consider an immediate lifting of the four-year-old oil embargo which has pushed Iraq into economic crisis. Diplomats said the Iraqi troop deployment had made such a relaxation impossible to contemplate for France, Russia, China and other Security Council members previously sympathetic to Iraq's case. Oil markets have reacted calmly to the tension. Showing little change from the Friday's close. US backs Clinton Page 7 Saddam back to centre stage Page 19 Lex Page 20</p>

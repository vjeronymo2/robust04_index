			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: GIO says state bank purchase unlikely GIO Australia, the Australian insurer privatised by the New South Wales government in 1992, yesterday described itself as 'an unlikely end acquirer' of the State Bank of New South Wales, the fifth-largest Australian bank being auctioned off by the NSW authorities. Mr Bill Jocelyn, GIO managing director, said that the acquisition of the bank 'would make more sense to a foreign bidder than it does to us'. GIO, he added, would be more interested in Suncorp, the Queensland-based financial services business that may be sold off by the state government there. GIO's comments came as it announced operating profit after tax and extraordinary items of ADollars 93.9m (USDollars 66.7m) in the six months to end-December, up from ADollars 42.9m in the same period in 1992. The figures benefited from unrealised capital gains of ADollars 49.6m, the result of a surge in share prices, compared with a loss of ADollars 2.4m in the same period the previous year. Operating profit before tax was ADollars 131.5m, against ADollars 72.8m last time.</p>

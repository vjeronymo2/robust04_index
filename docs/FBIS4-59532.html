			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Anisi  yesterday received an Arab League delegation led by Major  General Muhammad Sa'id Bayraqdar, assistant secretary general  for military affairs. The Arab League delegation is currently on  a visit to our country.    The two sides reviewed the developments in our country in  light of the war ignited in the homeland by the gang of apostasy  and secession in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leadership.    The deputy prime minister explained the developments in the  Yemeni arena, holding the secessionist rebellious leadership of  the YSP responsible for igniting the military situation in the  country. He noted that this took place in accordance with a  premeditated scheme and began with the actions of this gang,  which is rebelling against political legitimacy by violating the  framework of the government coalition, paralyzing the legitimate  institutions, casting doubts about them, and obstructing their  role.    The deputy prime minister expressed his appreciation for the  Arab League's role in shouldering its pan-Arab responsibility to  protect Yemeni unity, which is considered a pan-Arab achievement  that concerns all the sons of the Arab nation, and to support  justice and constitutional legitimacy.</p>

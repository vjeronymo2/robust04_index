			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Money Markets: Sterling more liquid THE HUGE liquidity problem that dogged the sterling cash market last week eased yesterday after the Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 800m at the start of its market operations, writes James Blitz. On Friday, the cost of borrowing money overnight peaked at a staggering 100 per cent because of acute shortages of sterling that were felt by commercial banks. Yesterday morning, there was more volatility in the short-dates as players expected the shortage of cash to keep the 'overnight' very high. However, the Bank eased the situation by forecasting a deficit half the size of what was expected, and by offering a 25-day repurchase agreement. The cost of 1 month money eased to 9 1/8 per cent offered, from a previous close of 9 1/2 per cent, although the 3-month offered rate remained at 8 per cent. Overnight money closed at around 11 per cent offered. That said, the market remains extremely nervous because of uncertainty over the government's policy on base rates. The run-up to the chancellor's Mansion House speech on Thursday is likely to be nerve-racking for dealers, as they toy with the idea of punting on another rate cut. There is plenty of scope for thinking that the shortages have not gone away, either. The market is bracing itself for the traditional liquidity problem that comes at the end of each month, when accounts need to be settled. There are also some Pounds 5bn outstanding in the system following the Bank of England's forex intervention on 'Black Wednesday'. 'What happens when the Bank's special lending facility to the market dries up later this year?' was the question put by one discount house dealer yesterday. Trading in sterling futures reflected the easier cash situation, with the December contract rising 13 basis points to a close of 93.52. In contrast to that bullishness, the December Euromark futures fell back 6 basis points yesterday after Bundesbank officials took a hawkish view on the prospect for near-term cuts in German interest rates. It closed at 91.48, a level that would see the German discount rate unchanged between now and Christmas. French franc futures closed unchanged at 90.94 after the Bank of France drained the cash market of liquidity and failed to cut rates.</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Defence contract talks with Malaysia revealed BRITAIN and Malaysia conducted secret negotiations on potential defence contracts during Mr John Major's recent visit to the Far East. While the visit laid emphasis on political ties and civilian contracts, it has emerged that the potentially more sensitive issue of defence was discussed behind the scenes. John Laing, the building group, confirmed yesterday that British and Malaysian officials had made progress in negotiations on a contract, worth more than Pounds 200m, for the construction of a high security special forces complex at Mersing, near the east coast of the Malaysian peninsula. Sources close to the company said that as a result of the discussions, the Malaysian government had agreed in principle to the first phase of the project, although the contract has yet to be signed. 'This is very much a hush-hush contract but we did get some very optimistic noises and we are very hopeful of our position now,' a company source said. It also emerged yesterday that Britain's GEC-Marconi is overseeing construction of an electronic command centre for Malaysia's armed forces at an undisclosed location, under a contract worth almost Pounds 100m. The project, agreed about two years ago, includes command and control facilities and communications for the planning of joint operations between the army, navy and air force. British defence officials are understood to believe the Malaysian bases may be useful for British operations after Hong Kong has been handed back to the Chinese in 1997. GEC-Marconi also has contracts with Malaysia to upgrade the country's air defence system and to build two missile-carrying frigates, while British Aerospace has sold Hawk trainer and fighter aircraft to the country. The deals come under a framework defence supply agreement signed five years ago. Malaysia has since diversified moved to diversify its sources of weapons by ordering MiG-29 fighters from Russia as well as F/A-18 jets from the US. Its purchases reflect a rapid arms build-up throughout south-east Asia. A potential flashpoint is the Spratly group of islands in the South China Sea.</p>

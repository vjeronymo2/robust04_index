			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Cardoso's lead undented by minister's departure Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, front-runner for Brazil's presidential election next month, seems to have kept his lead in opinion polls despite the resignation at the weekend of Mr Rubens Ricupero as finance minister. According to a poll on Monday, the day after Mr Ricupero stepped down, Mr Cardoso's support slipped from 45 per cent a week ago to 44 per cent, within the margin of error. His main opponent, Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Workers' Party, remained steady at 23 per cent. The Sao Paulo stock market took heart from the poll and was up 3.8 per cent at the close yesterday, following Monday's heavy selling. Mr Ricupero resigned after a private conversation was broadcast on satellite TV. During that, he admitted the government was backing Mr Cardoso and using its anti-inflation plan to win him votes. Mr Cardoso has since been heavily attacked by other candidates who have called such government support unfair and questioned the ethics of his campaign. The poll, conducted by the Datafolha institute among 10,532 electors, showed Mr Cardoso's support still solid among poorer, less-educated voters. However, it also gave some hope to Mr da Silva. Among wealthier voters, Mr Cardoso's support fell by five percentage points to 47 per cent. Mr da Silva's backing among these increased by four points to 26 per cent. Mr Cardoso's support also fell in metropolitan areas and in Brazil's more prosperous south. Mr da Silva's advisers hope this trend will continue as more people become aware of Mr Ricupero's resignation and the reasons for it, The poll showed Mr Cardoso apt to win the election outright on October 3 because his support still outstrips the combined support of his rivals. However, the poll suggested that, if a run-off between the two top candidates were needed on November 15, Mr Cardoso would gather 57 per cent support, Mr da Silva 30 per cent. Mr Cardoso's campaign organisers will also have been pleased to see that support for the anti-inflation plan, and its chief component, the Real currency, has continued to rise and now stands at 80 per cent. The candidate, when finance minister earlier this year, was responsible for negotiating the plan through Congress and his lead in the polls is largely due to the plan's popularity.</p>

			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / TUC looks at impact of Japanese MANY Japanese companies in the UK are more willing to work with trade unions than are British employers, according to Mr John Monks, TUC deputy general secretary. Mr Monks says in an article in Personnel Management magazine that while UK companies have derecognised unions many Japanese companies have recognition agreements with TUC affiliates. He says it is too early to assess the impact of Japanese companies on industrial relations in Britain. Some Japanese production and personnel systems appeal to British unions, particularly skill-building, abolishing status distinctions, emphasising quality and pushing creativity and responsibility to the shopfloor. On the negative side he points to disparity of pay between lead companies and subcontractors, the treatment of women workers and the lack of independent status for unions outside a company. Accusations of social control are equally worrying, he adds Mr Monks says Britain is the largest recipient of Japanese inward investment in Europe and the TUC is studying Japanese labour relations. UK companies had to respond to the challenge of meeting Japanese efficiency standards. Super-unions will erode the identity of union members with strong industrial traditions or special professional interests, according to Mr Roger Lyons, leader of the MSF technical and professional union. His statement follows the announcement that talks about a possible merger are to be held by the GMB and TGWU general unions. Mr Lyons urged unions to concentrate on individual services to members, although he admitted the 600,000-strong MSF, itself the product of a merger between ASTMS and TASS in 1988, had learned 'the hard way'.</p>

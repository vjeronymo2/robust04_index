			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): A package good only in parts - Financial Times IN THIS, the last British Budget for revenue alone, Mr Norman Lamont's political job was to salvage the reputation of his party and of himself. He had to offer a credible prospect for economic recovery and a tolerable profile for public sector borrowing in the medium term, alongside imaginative ways of raising the money. The mass of detail, particularly administrative detail, that the chancellor inflicted on his audience inevitably dulled the effect. But this is not the only reason why this Budget could do little to lift the hearts of his party, the nation or, for that matter, investors in government bonds, even though it should bring cheer to the boardrooms. The deplorable state of the public finances made it unavoidably depressing. Mr Lamont might have done better - not merely economically, but even politically - if he had made the best of his plight by being tougher. Nonetheless, he deserves at least one cheer for his efforts. The central tasks the chancellor set himself were to help recovery and tackle the deficit in the medium term. On the recovery, he has taken three risks. First, by announcing tax increases of Pounds 6.7bn for 1994-95 and Pounds 10.3bn for 1995-96 from an indexed base, he may discourage spending almost as much as if those increases took effect this year. Second, by failing to guarantee anything like a balanced budget in the medium term he may have threatened prospects for still lower long-term interest rates. Finally, by failing to take more decisive fiscal action he may have given himself less room than he could to lower short-term interest rates if needed. Since the second and third of these risks offset the first, the balance must be a matter of judgment. So far as the immediate recovery is concerned, Mr Lamont may well have judged rightly. Furthermore, even if he believes that 'interest rates at their current level are consistent with the achievement of the government's inflation objectives', Mr Lamont has room for manoeuvre on this most important of all instruments. In addition, by modifying the 'full-funding' rule, the chancellor will allow government borrowing to affect the growth of the money supply. Especially now that he has reinstated a monitoring range for broad money, this must be a sensible, though belated, change. In his discussion of the ERM - the guiding light of monetary policy only a year ago - he even came close to suggesting that everything was for the best in the best of all possible worlds. The ERM had, it seems, helped to get inflation down when that had to be done and had then spewed sterling out precisely when it was opportune in order to lower rates. For the short term at least, Mr Lamont must be right in this judgment. In the light of the succession of monetary policy disasters, however, the question has to be whether the freedom of manoeuvre the government now enjoys will be used aggressively enough in the short term and wisely enough in the longer term. Here the chancellor's medium-term fiscal judgment must be doubted. He is to be commended for proposing fiscal changes that will come into effect in 1994-95 and 1995-96. That is precisely what a medium-term strategy should provide for a country in the UK's current plight. The question is whether budget measures that deliver a fiscal adjustment rising from 1 per cent of gross domestic product in 1994-95 to 1.7 per cent in 1997-98 are enough. Not only does the chancellor forecast a public sector borrowing requirement of 8 per cent of GDP in 1993-94, but it is still 3 3/4 per cent in 1997-98. Moreover, the ratio of net public sector debt to GDP is forecast almost to double, to 50 per cent, by 1998. Yet this, it should be recalled, was a government that promised not long since to balance the budget over the cycle. The forecasts for growth of non-North Sea GDP that underlie these fiscal projections - 1 1/2 per cent between 1992-93 and 1993-94, followed by 2 1/4 per cent in 1994-95, 2 3/4 per cent in 1995-96 and 3 per cent thereafter - are not particularly optimistic. Nevertheless, much can still go wrong. Just how much is shown by perusal of forecasts made only a year ago - admittedly, just before an election - when the PSBR was supposed to be a mere 4 3/4 per cent of GDP in 1993-94 and 1 per cent in 1996-97. Once the chancellor had made the bold decision to announce future tax increases now, he should surely have gone further. Increases of 3 per cent of GDP by 1997-98 would have given far more confidence that further tax increases would not be needed. Further action would have been particularly sensible for a British government that enjoys complete monetary policy freedom once more and is headed by a prime minister who mutters about strategies for growth. The chancellor may well find himself raising taxes again. In its detail, the Budget is very good in some parts, not so good in others. It is a pity that the opportunity was not taken to announce the abolition of mortgage interest relief altogether, which would have done much to raise additional revenue. It is also a pity that the steady transformation of the 20p rate into a new basic rate of tax is making the structure of income tax system more complex. It is a pity too that the increase of one percentage point in employees' national insurance contributions guarantees further life for what is just another - and more regressive - income tax. First impressions are that the balance of these measures, with large increases in revenue from VAT on domestic fuel and power and national insurance contributions, will be regressive. The chancellor insists they are broadly proportional, however, partly because of the restriction of the married couple's allowance and mortgage interest relief to the 20p rate and the changes in the treatment of advance corporation tax as well. Unquestionably, there is much here to commend: the package of deregulatory measures for business, for example, and the measures to relieve the burden of surplus ACT. The Budget is cleverly green in its decision to raise the real burden of duties on petrol. Even more important is the chancellor's decision to raise revenue without increasing marginal rates of tax. Here he has done far better than Mr Clinton. In the end, however, this is a Budget with lots of good little ideas rather than one good big idea. The exception is the decision to announce future tax increases now, the drawback being that this action does not go far enough. This was a competent and professional performance, but the country could have done with something a good deal more dramatic.</p>

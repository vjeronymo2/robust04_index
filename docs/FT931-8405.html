			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Management: An affair which refuses to become a marriage IN THE characteristically blunt words of Sir Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel's chief executive: 'The British and the French have fought each other for a thousand years'. Their business and financial cultures are also virtual opposites. So it is not surprising that they find it hard to handle cross-Channel corporate marriages and joint ventures. All too often the two 'partners' war constantly with each other until one side - usually the French - emerges victorious. That may seem a caricature of a set of very complex relationships, but it is uncomfortably close to the truth. Witness two events this week: the long-awaited decision of Britain's MB-Caradon, successor to the old Metal Box company, to seek shareholders' authority to sell out of its packaging joint venture with Carnaud; and a frank speech by Sir Alastair, whose organisation is one of the few shining exceptions to the general rule. Take Eurotunnel first. It has had to overcome a legion of differences between the French and British ways of doing business, Sir Alastair told a conference in London. These ranged from contrasting approaches to the control of capital expenditure, to an entirely different attitude to meetings. Whereas British managers attended them to thrash out decisions, he said, 'the French go to find out what the boss has decided to do'. That Eurotunnel has bridged such gaps is due, above all, to the openness and trust which Sir Alastair and his opposite number established early in the venture. But his remarks were based on more than just personal experience. A long line of business school research studies, at both Limburg in the Netherlands and Insead near Paris, has put the UK and France at opposite poles on a whole range of cultural measurements. In common with the Dutch, Swedes, Canadians and Americans, Britons feel relatively independent of their bosses, for instance. But the French do not. Likewise, the Anglo Saxons and North Europeans are much better than the French at tolerating uncertainty - including over their own position in a hierarchy. Virtually the only similarity is in the degree of individualism, where the French score almost as highly as the British. But for the French this is associated closely with an individual's official, or 'positional' power, points out Philippe Haspeslagh, an Insead professor who specialises in mergers and acquisitions. 'In the UK an organisation is more a set of relationships in which you earn the right to manage.' That is only the start of this generally sorry saga. Consider, next, the chequered history of takeovers and mergers, regardless of nationality. A spate of consultancy and academic studies suggests that the average success rate of all types of takeover is only around 40 per cent  -and that includes the many straight acquisitions where one side is clearly in charge from the start. Even where the partners to a merger or joint venture are in closely related activities and markets, problems frequently occur because they have very different corporate cultures and styles of operating. It was this discrepancy, at least as much as national differences, which caused many of CarnaudMetalbox's early internal problems. The neutral German-American who was brought in to run the group in late 1991 said the Carnaud managers were used to a 'naively decentralised' style, while Metal Box had leaned too far in the other direction. Such problems can also be exacerbated when, from the very start, one partner sees its exit as a possible or even probable outcome. As Haspeslagh says, this is often the attitude of the UK side in a Franco-British venture. Whereas the UK partner is frequently a public company, with a price at which its shareholders will ultimately sell almost any part of their business, the French side tends to be a holding company controlled by a family - and its supporting banks - for whom the enterprise is not an Anglo-Saxon dividend machine, but a method for leveraging industrial power. The most notorious recent example of the Franco-British gulf in attitudes to investment and profitability was last year's fracas at the Arjo-Wiggins Appleton paper combine. This involved a tangled web of issues, including the sacking of the British chief executive and the apparent ability of the French shareholder, with only a 39 per cent holding, to dominate the board. With an attitude to the share price which was cavalier in Anglo Saxon terms, but prudent to the French, the result was a completely unexpected dividend cut which sent UK stockbrokers into apoplexy. In stark contrast is the relatively sunny short history of GEC-Alsthom, a nominally equal partnership in power engineering. Here, the French now occupy the two top jobs and three of the top five. It would be facile to say that the French are completely dominant, but it must be doubtful whether the partnership will develop the ideal culture: one entirely of its own. Some people claim this has occurred at the company's great Swedish-Swiss rival, ABB, although it actually feels far more Swedish than Swiss. If a truly equal partnership is impossible even between such partners, what hope is there for the French and the British, whose forms of capitalism and culture are so very different? The lesson may be that, with occasional exceptions, the two cultures are better at having affairs than at staying married.</p>

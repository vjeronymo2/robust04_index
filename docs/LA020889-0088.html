			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ NOTES ;  </P> <P> BRUBECK COMFORTABLE AFTER HEART SURGERY; NEW DRUMMER ADDED TO MCCOY TYNER TRIO  </P> <P> Noted pianist and composer Dave Brubeck, famed for his rendition of "Take  Five," successfully underwent a 4 1/2-hour, triple-coronary bypass surgery  Tuesday at Yale University Hospital in New Haven, Conn.  </P> <P> "The doctors couldn't be more pleased with the results," said Russell Gloyd,  39, Brubeck's manager. "He was in such sensational shape that everything worked  out fine." Brubeck was resting comfortably in the intensive care ward late  Tuesday, Gloyd said.  </P> <P> Brubeck's recuperation period is expected to be two months, and "the doctors  anticipate no problems because he was in such great shape," said Gloyd.  </P> <P> The pianist, despite known problems with clogged arteries for eight years,  continued to tour steadily. He had been on a strict diet and had been walking  five miles a day "up until two days before the surgery," Gloyd said.  </P> <P> The operation forced postponement of Brubeck's scheduled appearances for at  least two months, including several dates across the United States starting in  late February, followed by a three-week European tour slated for March.  </P> <P> "A dance program with the Murray Louis Dance Company in Winnipeg and Montreal  in April may still take still place," Gloyd said, "but that's obviously going  to depend on his condition."  </P> <P> Brubeck, a jazzman who studied with classicist Darius Milhaud early in his  career, formed his first quartet in 1951, and soon became one of the most  popular of jazz musicians. Though his compositions "In Your Own Sweet Way" and  "The Duke" have been widely recorded, he is still best known for his rendition  of "Take Five," which was written by his longtime alto saxophonist, the late  Paul Desmond.  </P> <P> NEW DRUMMER: McCoy Tyner, the pianist who plays with a heavy yet most lyrical  hand, has added a new drummer to his trio. Aaron Scott replaces Louis Hayes,  who had been with the pianist since 1984. "I heard Aaron, who's from Chicago  but had been living in Paris, when I was playing with the French National  Band," said Tyner, who plays through Sunday at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill in  Hollywood. "I really liked him, and when Louis left, I thought he'd fit  perfectly."  </P> <P> Tyner still has no plans to add any horns to his tightly-knit threesome. "I  love it, and besides I have an occasional big band that I put together in New  York, and that has plenty of horns," he laughed.  </P> <P> COME BLOW YOUR HORN: Musicians looking for their, to paraphrase Andy Warhol, 15  minutes in the footlights can compete in the fifth annual Hennessy Jazz Search.  The winner of this nationwide jazz talent contest, hosted by "The Tonight  Show's" Doc Severinsen, gets a spot as opening act at the Playboy Jazz  Festival's June 18 show at the Hollywood Bowl, plus $2,000 in prize money.  </P> <P> To enter, send a tape of your band, not more than 20 minutes long, to Hennessy  Jazz Search, 3435 Ocean Park Blvd., Suite 201-JAZZ, Santa Monica, 90405.  </P> <P> Entries, which must be postmarked by March 1, will be judged on their  originality, technique and creative style by an as-yet-unnamed panel of jazz  experts. Twelve semi-finalists from around the country will compete for the top  award, which will be determined at a play-off held locally May 16.  </P> <P> CURRENT AND CHOICE LPS: "Early Bird" (Sunnyside) from former Blakey pianist  Donald Brown is a modern mainstream session that bubbles with enthusiasm and  intelligence and ranges from sextet to solo piano tunes. "Bassically Simple" is  a no-nonsense rhythm changes opus, "Speak Low" goes from back-beat funk to  surging uptempo and "Playground for the Birds" has light-permeated buoyance.  Reedman Donald Harrison, trumpeter Bill Mobley and vibist Steve Nelson stand  out. . . . "Refuge" (Spindletop) is a New Age/contemporary jazz offering from  guitarist-keyboardist's Ric Flauding. The leader stresses his compositional  side, which runs from minimalistic pieces like "Heart Dancer" and "Mist and  Fog," though he stretches out on guitar on "The Night Is Not Silent."  Saxophonists Brandon Field and Keith Felch are other featured soloists.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article for PRENSA LATINA by Cuban journalist and analyst </F> Nicanor Leon Cotayo: "The Snowball Effect"]    [Text] Havana, 29 May (PL) -- While high-ranking government  spokesmen in Washington reaffirm that the blockade policy  against Cuba will not change, disapproval for this official  policy is quietly, but consistently, growing within the United  States.    One of the most significant things to take place within the  past few weeks is that the issue of the barrier around the  island is slowly gaining new attention in the U.S. Congress, and  this time, it is being opposed.    Not long ago, as you may recall, several committees within  the House of Representatives discussed a bill presented by  Congressman Charles Rangel. The bill called for a complete end  to the trade embargo. Now, the House Subcommittee on  Agriculture [as received] implicitly addressed the matter from a  similar position. This subcommittee held public hearings on 19  May under the title: Review of the Implications of Trade  Relations With Cuba on U.S. Agriculture.    Several panels comprising members of Congress, experts,  businessmen, and representatives of organizations related to  agricultural production companies participated in the hearings.    According to several people with whom I spoke and who  witnessed these proceedings, this time the conclusions moved  away from the negative conclusions usually voiced at such  hearings staged by extreme right-wingers from Florida and their  allies on Capitol Hill.    Except for the presentations made by two well-known  advocates  of this negative trend -- Lincoln Diaz Balart and Robert  Menendez -- all other participants focused their opinions and  questions on the business opportunities offered by the island.    The meeting was very technical and focused on economic and  commercial matters, and it was presided over by Representative  Timothy Penny, the chairman of the House subcommittee.    Incidentally, Penny was forced to call Republican  Congressman  Diaz Balart to order when he began listing the virtues of a  draft law about a Cuba without a revolutionary government.    Keeping his composure, Penny made it clear to the speaker  that the objective of the hearing was to discuss and learn more  about the possibility of reestablishing trade relations with  Cuba, and not to discuss or defend any law in particular.    As you may also recall, several House committees held  hearings a few weeks ago to examine Charles Rangel's bill  against the blockade. This is the first time the U.S. Congress  has addressed the matter.    In addition, for the first time at such meetings,  businessmen  expressed their disapproval of the isolation policy against the  island, and they went on to defend their right to do business  with Havana.    If we compare the final results of these congressional  hearings and the results of the hearings held by the House  Subcommittee on Agriculture, we can see that the new "no" we are  beginning to hear shows that, although Capitol Hill, for the  most part, supports the trade embargo against Cuba, there is an  interesting and positive change taking place on this issue,  which is beginning to roll like a small snowball all across the  United States.</p>

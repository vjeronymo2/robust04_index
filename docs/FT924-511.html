			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Forte holders agree to Gardner sale GARDNER MERCHANT, the contract catering company, yesterday began a journey to a likely stock market flotation when shareholders of its parent, Forte, agreed its sale to management. The sale proceeds will allow Forte to expand further in Europe and leaves the hotel group with a 24 per cent stake in the buy-out vehicle. Mr Garry Hawkes, the Gardner Merchant managing director, said the buy-out was 'an attempt to bring back ownership and hopefully motivation' to the managers who have delivered 15 per cent growth for Forte in recent years. Approval of the Pounds 402m deal came as Magnet, the DIY and kitchens group, provided another reminder that buy-outs are not always a gilded route to riches for management. Bankers yesterday put Magnet's holding company into receivership and took control of the trading company's assets. The timing of a return to the stock market, which could be as early as two years from now, will be dictated partly by the speed at which Gardner Merchant can increase operating profit and reduce debt. But it is equally dependent on the performance of Compass Group, the catering and hospitals group, which is one of Gardner's main UK competitors and which pulled out of talks to buy the company from Forte earlier this year. 'The progress of Compass must be very important,' said Mr Hawkes. 'It will be the bellwether share for Gardner Merchant and it will dictate what we can do when.' Mr Hawkes believes that Gardner Merchant's markets still retain considerable growth potential. In its core business of providing catering services to factories and offices, only 38 per cent of that market is currently covered by contracts. There are also the developing markets providing catering to hospitals and local authorities as the UK government accelerates its programme of contracting out services. Gardner Merchant is also at a substantial advantage over some other companies that have led leveraged buy-outs in that its businesses require very little capital. Debt is unlikely to be much of a burden and not only because the interest rates on most of the Pounds 200m of senior debt has been hedged long term. The deal involves more equity than many MBO's and more than would have been necessary had the proposed buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts earlier this year gone through. Mr Hawkes says that Gardner Merchant was, in any case, used to paying most of its profit and cash flow to Forte in dividends. 'The interest charge is no greater than what was taken out of the business by Forte,' Mr Hawkes says. Cash flow should also be adequate to repay debt over seven years. In its last financial year, Gardner raised operating profits by 16 per cent to Pounds 31.1m from sales of Pounds 864m. Almost 40 per cent of these sales are derived from 15 countries outside the UK.</p>

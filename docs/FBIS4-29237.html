In his interview he said it was proved that the present  "regime" is a treacherous and flunkeyist "regime" which evaded a  probe into the May 18 truth and opened rice market against the  demand of the people over the last one year and coiled up  tensions on the Korean peninsula with the introduction of  Patriot missiles.    It is a judgement of Hanchongnyon that there is no need to  expect from the Kim Yong-sam "regime" any longer, he said.    Touching on this year's reunification movement, he said that  the federation would defend the principle of great national  unity, demand the signing of a peace agreement and continue to  maintain the keynote of the student movement in the  reunification movement including a successful opening of the  pan-national rally.    He demanded that the present "regime" renounce its  anti-reunification attitude to suppress Hanchongnyon.</p>

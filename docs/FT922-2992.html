			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Books: Whatever happened to Harry? - Summer Fiction CRYSTAL ROOMS by Melvyn Bragg Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 14.99, 342 pages STRIKER by Hunter Davies Bloomsbury Pounds 9.99, 247 pages THE BROKEN LANDS by Robert Edric Cape Pounds 15.99, 278 pages SODOMIES IN ELEVEN POINT by Aldo Busi Faber &amp; Faber Pounds 14.99, 343 pages THERE WAS a bit of a stir in the literary world last year when Melvyn Bragg's current novel, Crystal Rooms, was first serialised in Esquire magazine. It contained an acid character sketch of a female reporter with 'feet too big, legs egg-white, hairless and stocky, topped by sumo thighs' leading up to 'belly folds that cascaded over a crotch once boasted as (and still) insatiable.' Popular opinion had it that this was a revenge attack on a well-known London journalist, whose last interview with Bragg had savaged both the man and his previous novel, A Time to Dance. Whatever the truth of the matter, Martha Potter is certainly a pretty unpleasant character in the book, both physically and behaviourally. She sleeps around, looks for victims to mug in print, and gets up to all sorts of abstruse behaviour that no nice person would ever contemplate. But she is not alone, because everyone else in the book is pretty unpleasant as well, whether they are paedophiliac MPs, ageing TV whizz kids, glamorous talking heads or elderly financiers who have seen better days. Almost the only decent character is 11-year-old Harry, an orphan from the North, who is brought to London by his aunt's boyfriend and abandoned outside the Crystal Rooms amusement arcade in Leicester Square. There he is picked up by a friendly adult who plans to sell him as fresh meat to the paedophile MP. But the plan comes unstuck when the MP falls chastely in love with the boy and whisks him out of harm's way, lodging him with a TV friend who lost her own son in an accident and has never been the same since. What happens to Harry after that is something of a puzzle however, because the story suddenly divides into several different plot lines, like an exploding firework, and the reader is left gaping at the various bits of it. Suffice it to say that there is a terrorist assassin in the plot, some masturbation, sexual coupling, power lunches - lots of those - and a great deal about the world of television and the shallow people who inhabit it. The book rattles along smoothly enough and is particularly good, almost Dickensian, when dealing with the trials of young Harry. But he is not on stage very often, and when he isn't it is hard to know who the leading character is or what, in a sentence, the story is about  - a legacy perhaps of its original appearance as a five-part serial. Striker, by Hunter Davies, is a rather less complex read, the alleged autobiography of Joe Swift - soccer star, ladies' man, and ultimate English sporting hero. The story begins in the back streets of Durham and progresses via Roy of the Rovers and trials at Carlisle and Newcastle to an apprenticeship with Spurs and training sessions in the same squad as - gulp  -Glen Hoddle and Garth Crooks. There are women on the way, huge babysitters to start with, then London pickups, then flashy model girls as Joe makes the first team and eventually the England side. He becomes a hero abroad as well as at home, being transferred first to the German league and then to the Italian, for increasingly large sums of money. At the end of every chapter he shows his manuscript to the people he has written about, who write back to him with a totally different, often hilarious recollection of events. It is an agreeable romp, told unpretentiously by a writer who keeps his tongue firmly in his cheek throughout. The Broken Lands, by Robert Edric, recreates the story of Sir John Franklin's search for a north-west passage around the top of Canada, a search which began with high hopes in 1845 and ended with nothing further being heard of the expedition for more than a decade. The author has delved into the archives and come up with a grim tale of tongues cut out, mad dogs hanged on gallows, food adulterated by red lead, suicide, snow blindness, lips lost to frostbite and almost every other Arctic horror you could imagine. It ought to be good - and is, up to a point - but there is an awkwardness about the writing that leaves the reader not entirely comfortable with the log-like progression of the narrative. The characters stumble on through the snow, dropping out one by one until hardly anyone is still alive. As a recreation of events it is true enough, but as the plot for a novel it could have done with more pace and tension. Aldo Busi's Sodomies in Eleven Point, ably translated by Stuart Hood, is not really a novel at all. The main character, for one thing, is Aldo Busi. He writes in the first person and regales us with a seemingly endless list of homosexual encounters, beginning with an Italian youth seduced through a fence on page two, and progressing from there to Morocco and Tunis and more pickups than the average person would ever want to shake a stick at. A very long stick. The author digresses on the way, giving us the benefit of his views on life and literature - some of them only half-coherent and all delivered in self-obsessed paragraphs which occasionally go on for pages at a time. Holidaying in Kenya, Busi notes with surprise that only one other person at the hotel has ever heard of him or his 'novels'. He makes it sound like a nice place to visit.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Tougher penalties sought for polluters TOUGHER penalties for industries that cause water pollution were proposed yesterday by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution to help reverse a 10-year decline in river quality in England and Wales. It said in a report on freshwater quality, published yesterday, that the improvement in river water between 1958 and 1980 had been followed by a decade of deterioration. It suggested that polluters - such as sewage treatment plants, industry and farmers - should be charged according to the volume and polluting characteristics of discharges, with the income used for pollution prevention and research, and grants for pollution abatement. In present National Rivers Authority schemes, polluters pay the cost of monitoring to ensure they meet agreed discharge levels. They also pay penalties for breaching them. The commission's proposed charges would initially be set to raise similar amounts to the authority's scheme - about Pounds 25m a year - but would be progressively increased. Lord Lewis the commission chairman, called for less reliance to be placed on the ability of rivers to assimilate waste. Instead, technology should be improved and public attitudes changed so that discharges of effluents into rivers could be progressively reduced. Among the report's 108 recommendations were a change in the way river quality is monitored, focusing on the presence of plants and animals and a range of pollutants, instead of just three chemicals as at present. Reduction of phosphate discharges and action to reduce acid rain were also urged. Friends of the Earth, the environmental campaign group, said the report was a 'litany of government neglect and mismanagement of Britain's lakes and rivers'. It 'revisited problems that should have been tackled years ago'. Other findings of the report were: There is no national monitoring programme for groundwaters, which are often 'extensively' polluted by industrial solvents. Rivers, lakes and reservoirs in most of central and southern England suffer from high levels of phosphate, causing excessive growth of surface plants and algae, which damages wildlife and causes difficulty for water users. Acid rain is making rivers in some parts of Scotland, northern England and Wales so acidic they are almost devoid of fish. In 1990, one in eight sewage works was still not operating within its discharge consents. Pesticide pollution remains high, a factor sometimes reflected in drinking water. In London, a six-month survey in 1989-90 found two thirds of samples with pesticides above EC limits. Freshwater Quality. Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution. HMSO. Pounds 57.</p>

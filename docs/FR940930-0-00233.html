			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FRA has reviewed its proposal in light of the comments received. After consideration, FRA has determined that extending the testing period from three months to one year is appropriate in conjunction with requiring that testing be performed whenever the warning system is modified because of a change in train speeds. FRA also notes that under the requirements of &sect;234.257, ``Warning system operation'', warning time must be tested if the warning system is modified in such a manner that the warning time might be affected. FRA also agrees that electronic devices which accurately determine actual warning time may be substituted for other tests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The labor/management group expressed confusion regarding the type of testing permitted under this section. The group stated that ``although the rule itself permits testing of the adequacy of warning time by calculation based on the fastest allowable train speed, the preamble creates confusion by its reference to testing with an actual train movement or `simulation of a train movement'.'' The group also stated that ``section 234.259, as written, permits calculation as a complying testing technique&blank;*&blank;*&blank;* .'' This conclusion is unfounded. The section-by-section analysis of the section stated that ``[testing] can be accomplished by observation of a train movement, if practical, or by calculation and simulation of a train movement. Calculation alone is not testing. It is merely a determination of design criteria. Only when the results of that calculation are combined with actions that determine that the mechanical, electrical or electronic system functions as intended, can an adequate test be done. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Final Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section requires that each crossing warning system shall be tested for the prescribed warning time at least once every 12 months, and when the warning system is modified because of a change in train speeds. Electronic devices that accurately determine warning time will be an acceptable means of meeting the requirements of this provision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 234.261&blank;Highway Traffic Signal Pre-emption <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule requires that highway traffic signal pre-emption interconnections, for which a railroad has maintenance responsibility, be tested at least once each month. The pre-emption of a highway traffic signal requires an electrical circuit between the control relay of the crossing warning system and the controller assembly of the highway traffic signal. The railroad will only be responsible for the maintenance and testing of its interconnections. The State of West Virginia noted that this section ``requires testing of the highway traffic signal preemption but doesn't include any notification requirement. If the preempt fails to work and the fault is on the highway side of the equipment, we need to be notified so that repairs can be initiated.'' Although it is beyond the scope of the present rulemaking to require notification of state highway departments when a signal maintainer discovers a malfunction of the highway traffic signal preemption equipment, FRA expects that such notifications would be routinely made. Nothing in this rulemaking is intended to preempt any local requirements that mandate notification to appropriate officials. However, we note that the railroad is not responsible for the controller assembly of the highway traffic signal and therefore the signal maintainer is not always aware of a malfunction of such equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Final Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final rule will remain as proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 234.263&blank;Relays <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The labor/management group supported the proposed rule. There was no opposition. The final rule will remain as proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Final Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (a) of this section requires that (except for certain relays listed in paragraph (b)) each relay that affects the proper functioning of a crossing warning system shall be tested at least once every four years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b)(1) requires that alternating current vane type relays, direct current polar type relays, and relays with soft iron magnetic structure shall be tested at least once every two years. Paragraph (b)(2) requires that alternating current centrifugal type relays shall be tested at least once every 12 months. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Belgian interest rate cut follows German easing BELGIUM'S central bank again cut two of its key interest rates yesterday in the wake of the easing in German monetary policy at the end of last week, writes James Blitz. However, unlike the rate cuts of the past few days, the move was followed by a depreciation in the value of the Belgian franc against the D-Mark. The Belgian authorities cut their central rate from 10.25 per cent to 10 per cent. They also cut their end-of-day rate from 12 to 11.75 per cent. The Belgian currency ended the day weaker against the D-Mark, closing at BFr21.41 against a previous BFr21.47. The currency may have fallen amid the buying of D-Marks against the dollar, sterling and most European currencies. But there were new signs yesterday that dealers are not interpreting the easing in European monetary policy as a harbinger of more cuts. Belgian interest rate futures, among the best guides to the market's expectation of rate moves, failed to rally yesterday. French interest rate futures were also weaker, despite the easing in the 5-10 day lending rate last week. Belgian muddle, Page 27</p>

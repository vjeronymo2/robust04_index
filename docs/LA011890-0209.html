			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC COAST LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> TRABUCO HILLS BLOWS BIG LEAD, THEN HANGS ON TO DEFEAT WOODBRIDGE  </P> <P> Just when the Trabuco Hills boys' basketball team seemed to be in a desperate  situation, it got some help from its Pacific Coast League opponent, Woodbridge.  </P> <P> Trabuco Hills, after blowing much of a 22-point, second-quarter lead, took  advantage of a late technical foul and held on for a 78-72 victory at  Woodbridge.  </P> <P> The victory also set up a battle for sole possession of the league lead when  Trabuco Hills (9-8 overall, 3-0 in league) travels to Laguna Beach Friday.  </P> <P> Trabuco Hills, which took its biggest lead, 36-14, with about five minutes left  in the second quarter, watched as Woodbridge (10-8, 2-1) cut the margin to six  with about three minutes remaining on Joey Cohen's layup. To make matters worse  for Trabuco Hills, Cohen was fouled on the play.  </P> <P> Cohen, however, missed the free throw and teammate Ryan Rauch slipped in for  the offensive rebound. Rauch missed the follow attempt, rebounded his miss and  went up again. An official whistled Rauch for fouling Trabuco Hills' Kerry  Kinkade on the second shot.  </P> <P> Woodbridge Coach Bill Shannon said Rauch then said something to an official  that resulted in a technical foul.  </P> <P> Kinkade made both free throws and one of the technical shots to increase  Trabuco Hills' lead to 69-60. The Mustangs then sealed the victory with four  consecutive points.  </P> <P> "That was a big call," Shannon said of Rauch's personal foul. "It's hard to  explain how a guy can have inside position and get called for a foul."  </P> <P> In other Pacific Coast League games:  </P> <P> Laguna Beach 74, Orange 48 -- Dain Blanton had 24 points and John Trevino had  22 for visiting Laguna Beach (14-3, 3-0). Jason Lee had 12 points and seven  rebounds for Orange (0-3, 6-10).  </P> <P> Laguna Hills 67, Costa Mesa 51 -- Al Salbana scored 18 points and Todd Peterson  17 to lead the Hawks (7-8, 1-2) at Laguna Hills. The Hawks trailed, 14-13, at  the end of the first quarter but outscored the Mustangs, 23-15, to take a 36-29  halftime lead and never trailed again. Brett Dieball scored 17 points for Costa  Mesa (2-12, 0-3).  </P></p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): New chips for old For many upgradeable PCs, replacing the old processor chip with the latest one is tantamount to putting a Ferrari engine in a mini - the rest of the machine cannot cope. Californian company General Micro Systems has now launched a machine which connects the components on the single board with a 64 bit bus which can transport data at a rate of 320 Megabytes a second - far faster than required by today's processors. The Predator, sold in Europe by FPS, of Bracknell, can handle any type of processor. GMS: US, 909 980 4813. FPS: UK, 0344 56921.</p>

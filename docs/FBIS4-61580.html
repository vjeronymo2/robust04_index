			<p>BFN     [Text] [Presenter Aleksandr Goryanov] We have just received  a statement by the Russian Foreign Ministry. It says, in  particular:    The reports from Yemen over the past few days speak about  wide-scale military actions. Despite numerous calls to stop the  firing, more and more units and subunits join the fighting and  the sides are using virtually all military means at their  disposal. The Russian leadership again appeals to the warring  sides with a pressing request to immediately stop all military  operations. No matter how deep the differences between the  participants of the conflict might be or what aims they might  pursue, we believe they cannot justify the fratricidal  bloodshed, more destruction and suffering of the entire people  of Yemen.    The government of the Russian Federation in Sana and the  Russian General Consulate in Aden are doing everything necessary  to ensure the safety of the Russian citizens in Yemen.</p>

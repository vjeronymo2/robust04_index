			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yin Wu (3009 0702) and reporter Yang Yuchen (2799 </F> 3768 6591): "Army Staff Officers College Succeeds in  Manufacturing Automatic Field Operations Command System"]    [Text] The history of staff officers participating in  making plans and devising strategies for operations by manual  use a map, a pen, and a watch is over in the Army Staff Officers  College. In mid-May, the automatic field operations command  system developed by this college was officially put into use in  teaching. This reporter saw a gratifying scene in the college's  basic staff training course classroom: More than 70 students  had finished drawing up operational plans and plotting tactical  charts with the application of computers, and their dream of  creating a device with reading, memorizing, calculating,  writing, drawing, and transmitting capacities had come true.    For many years the above six commanding capacities have been  manually operated in a traditional pattern and have been  "bottlenecks" affecting and restricting enhancement of command  functions due to low speed and efficiency. For this reason, the  Army Staff Officers College enlisted forces to tackle the key  problems and, after several years of hard work, succeeded in  developing this system, thus enabling the army to achieve the  objective of automatically handling the operational work of  staff officers.    Ma Kaicheng, an associate professor who is the principal  person in charge of this project, briefed this reporter, saying:  In using this system for "reading," instead of applying such  instruments as maps, magnetic needles, rulers, and so on, we  only have to strike the keys on the keyboard. The computer will  analyze various topographic elements. It will then display on  the screen the general configuration of the surface of the  battlefield in three dimensions with various angles and  altitudes, automatically showing on the map the measurement and  judgment of distance and area. In addition, in light of the  tactical background, the computer will produce specific charts  for parachute landing and traversing the area. The data base  of the system has a storing capacity of several hundred thousand  characters and over 100,000 items of classified data, which are  accurate and reliable and can be consulted at any moment. In  this way, it has changed the traditional function of "memory."  As to "calculation," the system can work out, among other  things, troop maneuvers, operational commands, and combat  capacity. Besides, in light of the strength, weaponry,  quantity, and quality of both our and enemy forces, it can also  give overall consideration to various factors including  environment, operations, combat actions, and so on to foresee  victory, defeat, advance, retreat, and exhaustion in a campaign,  so that decisions of the commanders will be more scientific. In  terms of "writing," by conducting dialogue between computer and  operator, the system can automatically draw up various operation  orders, instructions, and plans, and, the moment a commander  makes up his mind, draft a combat order. For "transmission,"  the system can automatically encipher and instantly transmit  messages with text as excellent as the accompanying pictures.    This reporter has noted that the system works on a  microcomputer which is just the size of a notebook. The success  of developing this device has blazed a new trail for the highly  efficient command of the headquarters in field operations. It  marks that our army has scaled a new height in automated  command. After watching the demonstration, leading cadres  including Zhang Wannian, Fu Quanyou, and others spoke highly of  the system, which, in the headquarters' view, represents the  reform orientation of command pattern of the headquarters.</p>

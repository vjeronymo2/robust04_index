There are four items on the agenda: the election of working  bodies, the rules of the first session, the election of chairman  of the Federation Council, and the election of vice chairmen.    The majority of the deputies demanded that the government  present a report because they believe that it does not know the  economic and social situation in the country. Following  debates, the decision was taken to ask Prime Minister  Chernomyrdin or some other leading Cabinet member to address the  Federation Council.    The rules of the session consist of 14 articles. If the  session is attended by two-thirds of the elected deputies (114),  the session shall be considered legitimate. One of the articles  defines the duties of the chairperson. During sessions he shall  have no right to comment on the deputies' speeches. Another  article says that the Federation Council's chairman and vice  chairmen shall be elected during a secret ballot. Each  candidacy to the post of vice chairman shall be discussed and a  separate vote shall be held on it.    After a break, at about 16:00, the working bodies of the  Federation Council's session will be elected, and debates will  be held on the election of the Federation Council's chairman and  vice chairmen.</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / French Transport Dispute: France may miss out on tourist record FRANCE'S road chaos means it is unlikely this year to achieve the hoped-for record of attracting 56m foreign visitors, outnumbering the country's population for the first time. The French tourist industry says it is suffering badly in spite of reports from travel companies and motoring associations across Europe that the dispute has not stopped many travellers from setting off. Some 60 per cent of people who have reserved hotel rooms since July 1 have failed to appear, said the Federation Nationale de l'Industrie Hoteliere. The situation was 'delicate, even catastrophic', said Mr Jacques The, president of the federation, which is asking the government for financial aid. Accor, France's largest hotel operator, said occupancy was down to 10 per cent in its Formule 1 cut-price chain, normally 95 per cent full at this time of the year. Euro Disney, the newly-opened theme park outside Paris, admitted the dispute was doing some damage. While its hotels had been 'very slightly affected', the impact on admissions to the park had been more noticeable. France, the world's second largest tourist destination after the US in spending terms, can ill afford to upset foreign visitors. Its tourist industry recorded a FFr51.3m (Pounds 5.26m) trade surplus last year, the largest of any French industrial sector. In Germany, which provided 11.2m visitors last year, the largest number from any country, ADAC, the motorists' club, suggested tourists take circuitous routes to the south of France. It advised trippers to be cautious, following reports of attacks by lorry drivers on German holidaymakers trying to skirt truck barricades. In the UK, France's second biggest tourist market, with 7.9m visitors last year, P&amp;O European Ferries said it had carried 130,000 travellers to France over the weekend, the same number as last year. The Automobile Association said it was advising motorists to use minor roads, carry spare blankets and food and a good map.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Yevgeniy Lenskiy, adviser to the first </F> deputy prime minister, by Aleksandr Golyayev; place and date not  given: "An Answer to Wastefulness"]    [Text] For almost a year a group of experts headed by  government First Deputy Chairman Oleg Soskovets has been working  on the problem of creating financial-industrial groups (FPGs).  Why has this process, of all others, attracted the government's  attention? Yevgeniy Lenskiy, an adviser to the first deputy  prime minister, answers this question.    [Lenskiy] In our difficult conditions it became necessary to  implement such production maneuvers as changing the production  profile, organizational restructuring of industrial sectors and  enterprises with precedence given to the development of the  nonstate sector. Under these circumstances, there is a shift  from an expenditure-based economy to a system of sectors and  enterprises, which produce, on the basis of new technologies,  the output everybody needs.    [Golyayev] What general economic tasks are being resolved in  the course of such a maneuver?    [Lenskiy] First and foremost, the fastest possible  overcoming  of the production decline on a, so to say, noninflationary  basis. This is probably the most important point.    [Golyayev] Is there a mechanism for resolving this problem?    [Lenskiy] This involves a series of economic measures, among  which one of the most important is to create conditions that  stimulate natural market changes in the structure of goods  produced and hence change the proportional weight of different  economic sectors. The meaning of the maneuver is not a  state-directed structural restructuring of industry from above,  but the state creating conditions whereby old enterprises  undergoing transformation along with newly-emerging private  enterprises build product markets along technological chains of  demand and supply.    An FPG is one of such mechanisms for implementing Russian  industrial policy. You see, it would be wrong to change the  "rules of the game" in the implementation of the privatization  program. This does not mean, however, that issues of adjustments  to the privatization policy are no longer on the agenda. Today,  in my opinion, it is mainly aimed at excessive fragmentation of  production and cannot result in the creation of a modern market  economy. I support the proposals of those who propose a course  toward the creation of large FPGs that will be competitive in  the world market, rather than creating internal competition at  the cost of a sharp decline of effectiveness of the national  economy. What is needed are groups of enterprises linked  together financially and technologically, exercising precise  planning of joint work, interacting with scientific and design  organizations. At the same time, we should avoid conglomeration  of enterprises making similar products--along the pattern of a  ministry or a main administration. What is needed are  associations competing with each other.    [Golyayev] They say that there are different opinions  regarding financial-industrial groups...    [Lenskiy] The people who do not accept FPGs are those who  know a plant or a shop only from textbook descriptions. This is  not serious. I support those who believe that we can no longer  put up with the fact that ministries and agencies are virtually  removed from the processes of reforming enterprises, their  privatization, forming the vitally needed market infrastructure,  influence over the consumer market. The role of the state should  be in facilitating the development of financial and legal norms,  personnel training, and other infrastructure-related activities.    In addition, the idea of organizing large quasi-government  multisectoral associations also sprang up among Russian  industrialists.    In the summer of last year, First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg  Soskovets signed a directive, which envisaged creating a  commission on the development of a "variant concept for  implementation of industrial policy in the environment of  privatization of state property." It is a long title, but the  substance of the document is quite simple: creating conditions  for setting up multisectoral industrial groups. The role of the  state also is clearly delineated: not to force the process of  FPG formation, but to monitor it, cut off the unneeded.    There have been many drafts, including those from the State  Committee on Industry, the State Committee for the  Administration of State Property, the Committee on Machine  Building, the Property Fund, and so-called independent experts.  An attempt to reject constructive alternatives and to present  the current industrial policy as the only true and possible one  represents, in our opinion, the most dangerous form of  monopolization, which blocks the road to the development of a  rational strategy of reforms. That is why the work on perfecting  the FPG concept continued, the final result of which was the  president's edict.    [Golyayev] What do we currently have in real life?    [Lenskiy] An amazing thing. The state is interested in it;  corresponding normative documents have been adopted; and at the  same time one gets the impression that someone is benefiting  from slowing down this process. Judge for yourself: In order to  "legitimize" creation of FPGs, concurrence of almost 10  ministries and agencies is needed. One would think it should be  simple: band together and start working. At this point, however,  it is impossible to "push through" the needed concurrence. Half  a year has passed, but not a single FPG has acquired the status  of a legitimate entity registered in a corresponding registry.    Plans are being developed on a broader scale as well. The  main efforts in the integration processes of CIS member  countries may be placed on interstate transnational corporations  and financial-industrial groups formed on a share-holding basis  and representing the entire complex of business services.    We would like very much to move from talk to action. I am  not  a supporter of campaigning, but let 1994 become a year for  forming Russian and transnational FPGs, corporations, and other  integrating entities.    Otherwise, foreign transnational corporations will suppress  Russian industrial structures, with the exception perhaps of  those in the raw materials sector. Russian citizens will hardly  be happy with this.</p>

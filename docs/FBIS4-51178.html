			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 3 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- Recently,  a book entitled Too Heavy To Call Him Father has  appeared overseas. It is "a work of fiction in the form of an  autobiography" that has been copied in turn by several  newspapers, to the extent that the readers are puzzled. In  Beijing, an authoritative historian specializing in the history  of the CPC has read it and said that the story in this fiction  is a complete fabrication, and the fiction is a vulgar piece of  work that gains fame by deceiving the public.    The author, called "Ai Bei," told a story in her book,  saying  that Zhou Enlai had had an extramarital affair with "An Ran," a  secretary working for the Volunteers. When he knew that "An  Ran" was pregnant, he insisted on having the baby, and for this  reason he ran into a "marital crisis" with Deng Yingchao.  During an interview with the reporters from this news agency,  the expert, who has spent a long time researching the history of  the CPC, pointed out that the persons who are familiar with  China's political environment in the 1950's and those who  understand Zhou Enlai's political beliefs and daily life, will  be able to tell immediately that this plot is ridiculous.    The expert also said that there was a very rigid security  system at the senior level of the CPC, and it was virtually  impossible for Zhou Enlai to freely meet with "An Ran," as the  book described. If the story in the book were true, then it  would have been leaked a long time ago. During the Cultural  Revolution, Jiang Qing and her followers dug three meters deep  into the ground to collect material to topple Zhou Enlai. If  there were such a rumor, then why would they not use it? Why  has no one heard about it before?    The expert said that this so-called "work of fiction in the  form of an autobiography" was a fabricated story, and that this  point is beyond any doubt. A writer has the freedom of  creation, but randomly fabricating "an affair" to harm the  reputation of a late dignitary and to cheat the public is very  mean and immoral behavior. This person, who calls herself "Ai  Bei," is in fact not Zhou Enlai's daughter, and her real life  background will be uncovered by the people one day. By then the  world will know the truth.</p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  3 CHARGED WITH KIDNAPING WOMAN  </P> <P> A Cal State Northridge student and two of her friends have been charged with  kidnaping and conspiracy to murder a woman she suspected of burglarizing her  campus apartment.  </P> <P> Christi Daniels, 19; Kenneth Ceasar, 23, and an 18-year-old suspect who was a  juvenile at the time were arrested after the Jan. 5 abduction of Czarian  Ramsey, 18.  </P> <P> The three allegedly drove Ramsey to a deserted park-and-ride lot in Newhall,  put her on the ground in the rain and questioned her at gunpoint about the  burglary. But sheriff's deputies on routine patrol happened upon the scene and  arrested the three, all from South-Central Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Police said Daniels, a freshman, reported that $18,000 worth of clothing,  jewelry and other items were taken from her apartment Jan. 3. CSUN Police Lt.  Mark Hissong said a witness told of seeing Ramsey of San Pedro, a long-time  friend of Daniels, leave the apartment with a pile of clothing.  </P> <P> Authorities said the investigation was proceeding when Daniels apparently tired  of waiting and went to Ramsey's Sherman Oaks apartment, persuading her to go  outside to a car.  </P></p>

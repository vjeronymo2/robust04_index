			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> FIRST LADY GETS THYROID REMEDY  </P> <P> Barbara Bush underwent radioactive treatment today to destroy her thyroid gland  because it is producing excess levels of hormones, a condition that has  irritated her eyes and caused her to lose 18 pounds in recent months.  </P> <P> "She's just fine, piece of cake, never broke her stride," her press secretary,  Anna Perez, said after the President's wife returned to the White House after a  two-hour stay at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.  </P> <P> The radiation was administered in an iodine solution sipped through a straw.  Mrs. Bush said it was a colorless liquid that tasted like water, Perez  reported.  </P> <P> Doctors told Mrs. Bush, 63, that the only side effect she may suffer is a  slight pain in the neck for several days. "She cracked jokes about that all  day," Perez said.  </P> <P> A White House statement said the procedure "has no significant side effects"  and has been a standard treatment for 40 years for people suffering with Mrs.  Bush's condition, known as Graves disease.  </P></p>

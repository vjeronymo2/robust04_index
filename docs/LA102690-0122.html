			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EDELMAN'S TRY TO RELEASE AIDS MONEY IS  BLOCKED  </P> <P> Two conservative members of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors this  week blocked a proposal to reduce the long waiting period AIDS patients face at  County-USC Medical Center.  </P> <P> Supervisor Ed Edelman had proposed that the 22-week waiting period be cut by  immediately spending $500,000 that was set aside to staff a new AIDS outpatient  clinic at the hospital next spring.  </P> <P> But supervisors Pete Schabarum and Mike Antonovich opposed the motion, arguing  that by using the funds now the county would not have the money to hire the  staff needed at the new clinic.  </P> <P> Edelman, a liberal who has consistently urged his conservative counterparts to  increase AIDS funding, maintained that "the need is now." But Antonovich and  Schabarum told Edelman he was counting on federal and state funds that may not  be forthcoming.  </P></p>

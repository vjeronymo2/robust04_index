			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures bounced from recent lows to move sharply ahead, encouraging a recovery in the cash market. However, the June Footsie futures contract remained at a discount throughout the session, writes Terry Byland. The discount against the cash market recorded by the June futures contract was much reduced from the 30 points seen on Wednesday and trading volume remained healthy. Traders commented that selling had been overdone this week and that investors were in the mood to test the market. Some further selling from US sources was seen at the opening but, in the absence of the Frankfurt markets, London futures soon rallied. For most of the session the discount on the June future was cut to around 11 points and the day's low of 2,923 on the contract was reached very early. Buyers continued to appear throughout the day and the final official quotation of 2,968 on the contract was 60 points higher than its previous close and showed a discount reduced to 10 points against cash. Turnover at the close was just above 17,500 lots. However, in traded options, volume dipped from Wednesday's 36,389 contracts to 30,170 yesterday, and the Footsie option recorded only 13,076, against 18,189. Among stock options, British Gas (1,819) headed the list.</p>

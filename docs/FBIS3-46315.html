Diplomatic sources here think that King Sihanouk, who  underwent an operation for cancer at the hospital, is now in  serious condition.    Immediately after his rectum was operated on in October last  year, King Sihanouk announced: "I have contracted cancer." He  is currently being hospitalized at an army hospital in Beijing.  Prime Minister Ranariddh reportedly visited the king at the  hospital on the evening of 17 January, upon the delegation's  arrival in Beijing. Prime Minister Hun Sen visited the king on  18 January. The Sihanouk Office [name as published] and the  Cambodian Embassy in Beijing have not given answers to why the  two did not visit the king together.    Claiming that he is ill, King Sihanouk has been controlling  Cambodian politics from Beijing. A diplomatic source said:  "His health condition does not seem to be the same as it was  when he initially chose to `pursue politics' from here. Despite  the visits by the two prime ministers, no message has been  delivered from the king. This indicates that his health  condition is worsening."</p>

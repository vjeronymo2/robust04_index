			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- Interior Minister Manfred Kanther  (Christian Democratic Union) is concerned about the "alarming"  increase in criminal offenses in Germany. During a meeting at  the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in St. Augustin near Bonn,  Kanther stressed today that the overall number of registered  criminal offenses rose to 6.7 million last year. In 1992, the  number was approximately 6.3 million. The citizens "feel very  insecure and are very worried." The citizens' feeling of  security is greatly impaired.    Kanther mentioned particularly street crime, burglaries, and  offenses involving cars. In addition, "thefts are rising fast  and organized crime is spreading in a disquieting manner."  Criminal organizations with rigid and hierarchical structures  that are based on the division of labor increasingly infiltrate  Germany's economic and social system. Because of the enormous  profits, this development takes place at an "alarming speed,"  the minister pointed out.    Cross-border crime also plays an increasingly dangerous  role.  As a result of the collapse of communism in East Europe, the  international embezzlement of motor vehicles has risen  considerably. According to the findings of the investigating  authorities, around 40 percent of the cars registered as stolen  are never found. Cooperation with the police in the East  European states must be intensified. The protection of the  external borders and the fight against smuggling refugees is  assuming increasing significance, Kanther stressed. Last year,  over 54,000 foreigners were caught crossing the border illegally.    Europe's desired integration must not have the effect that  borders fall for the criminals but continue to exist for the  investigating authorities, the minister emphasized. Europe  needs a common asylum policy. By shifting personnel within the  Federal Border Police (BGS) and through flexible deployment  concepts, the BGS units should be used for the protection of the  borders to a greater extent than in the past, Kanther announced.  The 1994 law on the fight against crime will probably be  adopted by the Bundestag before the end of this week. The law  on the BGS and the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation are  also designed to enhance internal security.</p>

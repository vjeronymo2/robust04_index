			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> PENNSYLVANIA;  </P> <P> STUDENTS EXPOSED TO LEUKEMIA VIRUS  </P> <P> Dozens of preschool children and eight University of Pennsylvania veterinary  students were exposed to lambs that had been injected with a potentially fatal  virus, but school officials said the risk of anyone getting ill was extremely  remote. Nevertheless, the university is recommending that a score of students  and staff be tested for the virus as a precaution and has offered blood tests  to about 100 children who came in contact with the lambs.  </P> <P> The lambs had been inoculated with the virus, which can cause a fatal form of  leukemia. It can take 10 to 30 years for the virus to develop in humans. A  university spokesman in Philadelphia said a breach in laboratory regulations by  a senior researcher exposed the students, staff and the children who petted the  lambs during a field trip last month to Penn's New Bolton Center near Kennett  Square, Pa.  </P></p>

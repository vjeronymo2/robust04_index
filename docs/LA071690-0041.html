			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POOR FEELING THE PINCH AS LOW-RENT HOUSING SHRINKS  </P> <P> For home buyers, this city ranks among the most expensive in the country:  $182,300 for a typical one-family home. Developers are searching everywhere for  land to build fancy homes for families with fancy incomes.  </P> <P> Their search has led them all the way to the Dudley Station area, on the edge  of Roxbury, the largely black inner city of Boston. A few years ago, the Boston  Redevelopment Authority announced that it planned to invest $750 million in the  Dudley Station neighborhood. Speculators descended immediately to buy up  property.  </P> <P> "Without one spade being put in the ground, one brick being put into place,  housing costs have tripled in six years," said Mel King, a political science  professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a defeated candidate  for mayor.  </P> <P> Boston middle-class whites are still too fearful to move to the inner city. But  the dream of gentrification in the future has already made housing too  expensive for many poor people in Dudley Station.  </P> <P> What happened to the people who used to live in the area? "Some people moved .  . . others doubled up," King said. "There's no place to go."  </P> <P> Poor people nationwide are finding the same thing: There's no place to go when  wealthy city dwellers set their sights on their neighborhoods. Homelessness has  become a more serious problem than at any time since the Depression. And now it  is driven in considerable measure not only by poverty but by wealth.  </P> <P> "The last major outbreak (of homelessness) occurred as a consequence of the  worst economic crisis in American history; the current situation exists in the  midst of national prosperity literally unparalleled in the history of the  world," sociologist James D. Wright asserts in his book "Address Unknown: The  Homeless in America."  </P> <P> Gentrification is only one cause. Drugs and alcohol have thrown countless  people onto the streets. The mentally ill, no longer automatically housed in  institutions, make up another category of the homeless.  </P> <P> But many Americans are homeless simply because there is no affordable housing  for them. To paraphrase what President Calvin Coolidge once said about  unemployment: When a great many people cannot afford to live anywhere,  homelessness results.  </P> <P> "Some of the homeless are broken-down alcoholics, but most of them are not,"  Wright said. "Some are mentally impaired, but most of them are not. Some are  living off the benefit programs made available through the social welfare  system, but most of them are not. Clearly, none of the popular mythologies  provide an adequate portrait of the homeless in America today."  </P> <P> In Wright's view, inadequate housing is responsible for most of the nation's  homelessness. The addicts and the mentally ill, he says, only obscure the fact  that many of the homeless are ordinary Americans down on their luck.  </P> <P> If he is right, the crisis has an obvious cure -- more low-rent housing. But  that requires massive amounts of money, and support for affordable housing has  dwindled since the Ronald Reagan Administration cut deep into federal housing  subsidies nearly a decade ago.  </P> <P> The number of low-rent housing units, as defined in a recent report by the  Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Low Income Housing Information  Service, declined by 19% from 1970 to 1985. During that same period, the number  of officially poor persons grew by 30%.  </P> <P> Nobody knows how many homeless Americans there are. Estimates range from the  Housing and Urban Development Department's 350,000 to the National Coalition  for the Homeless' 3 million. Regardless of their exact number, a large  proportion of the homeless are unmistakable in all the nation's major cities --  sleeping in parks, panhandling at subway stops, living in single-room-occupancy  hotels and other shelters.  </P> <P> On the nights of March 20 and 21, pairs of U.S. Census Bureau enumerators  counted the people who "appear to be homeless" as they entered soup kitchens  and places where social service officials in 490 census districts said the  homeless were likely to spend the night. But critics insist that the  enumerators missed many of the homeless. The census figures, when finally  released in a year or so, are sure to be denounced as inadequate.  </P> <P> Wright, a professor at Tulane University, has reviewed existing studies and  examined the homeless populations in 12 large U.S. cities. He offered a  "reasoned guess" of somewhere between 500,000 and 750,000 people who are  homeless every night and three or four times that many who are so poor that  they could become homeless virtually any night of the year.  </P> <P> By Wright's accounting, six Americans in every 1,000 will become homeless  during their lifetimes.  </P> <P> "By any standards, all the estimates point to a national disgrace, clearly  unacceptable in a rich, humane society," said Peter H. Rossi, acting director  of the Social and Demographic Research Institute at the University of  Massachusetts.  </P> <P> Many poor people, unable to find work and pay rent, have avoided homelessness  by moving in with relatives. But crowded homes are often tense, and unhappy  homes and householders sometimes show the door to relatives who are unable to  pay their share of the rent.  </P> <P> That happened to Willie Williams, a 41-year-old janitor at a homeless center in  Philadelphia. Unemployed and unable to pay rent, Williams, his wife and their  two children moved in with his sister.  </P> <P> "She's the kind of woman that, as long as you do what she says, everything is  fine," Williams said in an interview. After a year, she evicted his family, and  they had to take shelter for six months. For Williams, the homeless episode led  to both a job and federally subsidized housing. But not all the homeless are so  fortunate.  </P> <P> The homeless have always been among us. At the turn of the century, migrating  workers and recently arrived immigrants found their ways into the cities  without a place to hang their hats. The number of people without permanent  addresses grew enormously during the Great Depression; the Federal Emergency  Relief Administration housed upward of 125,000 people in its transient camps  across the nation.  </P> <P> While World War II created a boom in employment, homelessness persisted. Hobos  rode the rails, and Skid Row bums concentrated in the seedy parts of most U.S.  cities. They were out of sight of most of the middle-class population. By  contrast, many of today's homeless are clearly visible.  </P> <P> "These, truly, are the poorest of the poor -- the new homeless -- and they are  best seen as the victims of large-scale social and historical trends assuredly  not of their own making," Wright said.  </P> <P> The old homeless were typically male, white and 50 or older. Today, experts  estimate that at least one-third of the homeless are women and children. A  disproportionate number are black, Latino and American Indians. The adults are  typically younger than a generation ago, more likely in their 30s than their  50s.  </P> <P> The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Low Income Housing  Information Service reported that there were 9.7 million housing units in 1970  that were within the budgets of the nation's poor. By 1985, the groups said,  the number had declined to 7.9 million. Their report defined poor families as  those with incomes of less than $10,000 in 1985 dollars.  </P> <P> The report said that the typical poverty-level household in 1985 had an income  of about $5,000 and spent 65% of it for rent and utilities. That left "only  $145 per month -- or less than $35 a week -- remaining for all other cash  expenses for all household members."  </P> <P> Fully 85% of renters, the report said, paid more than 30% of their incomes  toward rent -- HUD's standard for the maximum share of income that should be  devoted to housing.  </P> <P> "Large declines in household incomes and increases in housing costs have driven  housing out of the affordable range for many low-income households," the report  concluded.  </P> <P> In cities across the country, community organizations are struggling to hold  the line against the destruction of low-income housing.  </P> <P> Here in Boston, the Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative, organized by Gus  Newport, the former mayor of Berkeley, Calif., is buying all the abandoned and  vacant lots it can in the largely black Roxbury neighborhood. The organization  is racing against gentrification, hoping to give residents less reason to fear  homelessness.  </P> <P> On the edge of Roxbury, Alphonse Mourad, a Lebanese-American landlord who lost  his boyhood home in Boston to gentrification years ago, is still fighting --  and still losing. Mourad bought a 276-unit low-rent apartment building from HUD  several years ago and promised the tenants that if he could recoup his  investment, he would sell the building to them. Otherwise, Mourad insisted, the  building eventually would be sold on the open market and then demolished to  make way for high-income tenants.  </P> <P> Mourad changed the identity of his apartment building by erecting a sign that  stands vertically in white relief against the red brick: M-A-N-D-E-L-A. By  renaming the complex after South African anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela,  Mourad hoped to inspire pride among the 1,500 predominately black, low-income  residents.  </P> <P> That worked: The residents planted flowers, formed security patrols to force  out drug dealers and prostitutes and organized a tenant-management committee  that tried to preserve the place for low-income dwellers.  </P> <P> But the tenants were unable to raise enough funds to buy the building. Mourad,  claiming he could not afford the assessed taxes, could not make his mortgage  payments a few months ago and lost control of the development. He predicted  that developers would eventually drive out his low-income tenants. "Right now,  this area . . . is a prime location," Mourad said.  </P> <P> In Washington, D.C., the Lutheran Church's Trinity Housing Project has  purchased and upgraded 20 ramshackle apartments for use by homeless families.  Project director Mary Lou Tietz said that families are selected from about 13  family homeless shelters in Washington for the one-, two- and three-bedroom  apartments in which they live until permanent housing is found for them.  </P> <P> Operating with an annual budget of about $215,000 from HUD, the project seeks  to relocate homeless families from welfare hotels and overcrowded shelters and  to give them an opportunity to become independent within two to three years.  The transient house known as Trinity Arms, a comfortable building nestled amid  federal government offices and dilapidated inner-city houses, opened in July,  1988. The first seven families at Trinity Arms have moved into apartments of  their own.  </P> <P> "Most of the families that have come here are headed by single mothers," Tietz  said. "They can't afford day care and housing costs on their limited salaries.  Obviously they wouldn't be homeless unless they've suffered from a lot of  problems."  </P> <P> One Trinity Arms resident is Doris Pryor, 40, who lives with her 14-year-old  son and twin 5-year-old granddaughters in a three-bedroom transient apartment  that she rents for $80 a month. Her rent is slightly more than one-quarter of  the $300 she earns per month baby-sitting for neighbors.  </P> <P> The apartment is a colorful place filled with bric-a-brac, family photographs  and wildlife prints. "I like to decorate," she said with a proud smile and a  sweep of her arm to usher visitors into the living room.  </P> <P> "I've been moving around so much," she said, ticking off some half a dozen  residences over the last decade. Just before moving into Trinity Arms, she had  spent two months at the General Scott Inn, a motel serving as a homeless  shelter. Before that, she lived with her mother in a house that provided  shelter for a total of four adults and 16 children.  </P> <P> "After a year, she told me I had to go," Pryor said. "Like a mother, she had  tried to take all the children in."  </P> <P> Tietz said that Pryor eventually will have to leave Trinity Arms and find a  permanent place of her own. But Pryor dreads the idea of moving out.  </P> <P> "The past is just like something I'm trying to forget," she said, her head  sagging. "I'm trying to move ahead now."  </P> <P> The Lutheran project is not a comprehensive approach to the problem of the  homeless in Washington. It does little more than give temporary shelter to  perhaps two dozen homeless families who are still searching for permanent,  inexpensive housing.  </P> <P> For the bulk of the homeless, experts agree on what is needed: more low-cost  housing. That might not entice all the drifters and alcoholics and addicts off  the streets. But it would address the predicament of Pryor and the countless  homeless like her.  </P> <P> Some states and cities, including New Jersey and Amherst, Mass., require  developers to include moderately priced housing in their plans as a condition  for zoning and building permits.  </P> <P> "Given the sums of money being made on real estate development, this does not  seem an untoward or onerous restriction," Wright wrote. "Perhaps some federal  matching money could be targeted for large-scale development projects to  increase the number of low-rent units to be built."  </P> <P> Likewise, some cities are considering whether to increase their financial  commitment to low-cost housing. In Atlanta, Jared Samples, a 23-year-old city  councilman who grew up in one of the city's public housing projects, says that  his advocacy of more affordable housing accounted for his election.  </P> <P> "Since 1968 there's been no more public housing in the city of Atlanta," he  said. "Why can't you float a revenue bond to build affordable housing? The  population in public housing is growing from within. We need to create  something to provide some housing for some of these people."  </P> <P> But most analysts believe that only the federal government has the wherewithal  to address the problem. Wright said that "a renewed federal commitment to  subsidized construction of low-income units" is the most efficient answer to  housing the homeless. "I think, roughly speaking, that would cost about $100  billion over the next decade so that by the year 2000, we would have an  adequate supply," he said.  </P> <P> While Ronald Reagan was President, financing for low-income housing was  substantially trimmed. The number of families receiving federal housing  assistance -- those living in public housing or receiving rent subsidies -- has  more than doubled from about 2 million in 1977 to 4.5 million now, according to  the Congressional Budget Office.  </P> <P> But much of the growth was fueled by commitments made before that period. New  commitments to build public housing or provide rent subsidies fell from 375,000  in 1977 to a recent low of 78,000 in 1983 before leveling off at 100,000 for  this year and the previous two.  </P> <P> Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn, releasing a U.S. Conference of Mayors survey  last fall that found increasing levels of hunger and homelessness in 27 big  cities, observed that "it has not been the politically fashionable thing up on  Capitol Hill to help poor people."  </P> <P> There was one exception. In 1987, Congress enacted the McKinney Homeless  Assistance Act, the first comprehensive federal law aimed at homelessness. The  act provided funds for a medley of 16 programs, including support aimed at  alleviating the problems of the homeless. The programs -- some funding private  agencies, others acting through state and local governments -- supported  shelters, food distribution, job training, health care, drug treatment and  other activities.  </P> <P> But Reagan signed the bill into law only "with reluctance." Congress then  appropriated less than the total sums of money authorized by the McKinney Act  -- $388 million for 1989, for example, compared with an authorization of $634  million. And the federal agencies responsible for administering the programs  delayed releasing the available funds until housing advocates won a series of  federal court rulings in Washington in 1987 and 1988 that forced them to do so.  </P> <P> George Bush, during one of his 1988 campaign debates with Democratic  presidential nominee Michael S. Dukakis, called for full funding of the  McKinney Act. Since moving into the White House, he has come close to keeping  his word. Congress appropriated $607.4 million in 1990, close to what the  President requested. For 1991, the President has asked for an increase to $749  million.  </P> <P> Critics of federal efforts on behalf of the homeless are not impressed. The  McKinney Act, they point out, does nothing to address the fundamental problem  -- insufficient low-income housing.  </P> <P> "Despite the new -- and welcome -- rhetoric, the Administration's proposals  fall far short of providing a serious response to homelessness," according to  an analysis of the McKinney Act by the National Law Center on Homelessness and  Poverty.  </P> <P> "Funding is still inadequate."  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Gornostayev, Cairo-Moscow, under rubric </F> "Near East": "Moscow as a Diplomatic Regulator: The Two Sides  Are Turning to Washington for Economic Support"]    [Text] Just yesterday, the next day after the signing of  agreements concerning the introduction of partial Palestinian  autonomy in Gaza and Jericho, experts began consultative work on  the forces of the Palestinian police. The participants in the  training of the new ministers of law and order will also include  Moscow, but to a rather small degree: 45 future Palestinian  policemen will undergo training in Russia, and, in addition,  Moscow will provide certain equipment to the PLO. On the part of  Israel there are no obstacles to this kind of apportionment. The  main problem is to carry out the pledges promptly. But it is  difficult to do this without a good economic base. The lack of  this base also largely influences the placement of the foreign  forces in the Near East, where one currently senses to a greater  and greater extent the dominance of the United States.  Naturally, a rather large part of the financial and economic  support for developing Palestinian autonomy directly or  indirectly -- by way of Israel -- comes specifically from there.  Tel Aviv has traditionally gravitated toward Washington, but now  that tendency is also typical, to a certain degree, of the PLO.  Understandably, Yasir 'Arafat currently, after the attainment of  peace, has a self-interest primarily in economic support, in  order to demonstrate to his people the fruits of peace and to  prove to them all the practical advantages of goodneighborly  coexistence with Israel.    The appeal was made to Moscow when Israel and the PLO were  confronted by questions with regard to which they did not trust  one another, and it was difficult to manage without Russia.  Evidence of this is provided by the recent visits to Moscow made  one after the other by Yasir 'Arafat and Yitchaq Rabin. Judging  from the fact that the agreement of autonomy was signed two  weeks after the visits to Russia by the Near East grandees,  Moscow succeeded in playing its role in this matter, by speeding  up the settlement process. It would seem that no small role has  been played here also by the traditional ties: Palestine-Russia  (in the past,, the USSR) and Israel-Unuted States. Trust does  exist along these lines. It also exists along the US-Russia  line, especially since both these countries are acting as  cosponsors of the Near East settlement. The fact that the two  sides of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict could not talk to one  another face to face was transmitted until recently along the  chain PLO-Russia-United States-Israel, or in the reverse order,  or even without the third link. Now, however, the Palestinians  are seeking greater trust and ties on the part of Washington.    There was also a clarification of the details of why Rabin  and 'Arafat signed the agreement twice. The PLO leader, while  viewing the so-called Blue Folder -- the detailed appendix to  the agreement -- at first did not want to sign it, and appended  a statement to the part pertaining to questions of security,  with demands for additional guarantees from the cosponsors --  Russia and the United States. During the urgently announced  break they were given to him, and the agreement was consolidated  by signatures a second time.    Speaking about peace in the Palestinian sector, Shim'on  Peres, Israeli minister of foreign affairs, stated that his  country would strive for the same resolution with respect to  Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon.    As for the first of these states, it is assumed that here  Russia has certain levers for exerting pressure on the Arab  side, confirmation of which will be provided by the definite  results of the visit to Damascus by a delegation headed by Oleg  Soskovets, RF first vice-premier. Most probably, the direct  contacts between Israel and Syria will proceed secretly, as was  the case with the PLO.</p>

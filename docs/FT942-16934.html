			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / International Company News: Creditors back America West plan America West Airlines, the last big US airline still in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, yesterday said it had won its creditors' agreement to an amended reorganisation plan aimed at bringing the company out of bankruptcy by early autumn. The scheme will deliver effective control of the company to the same investment group that brought Continental Airlines out of bankruptcy last year and which owns 28 per cent of Continental. The reorganisation plan incorporates a co-operation agreement between America West and Continental, under which the two airlines will work together in a number of operational and marketing areas - for example, sharing flight codes on the same routes and merging their frequent-flyer programmes. Mr Bill Franke, America West's chairman, said the benefits of this alliance would be worth at least Dollars 40m a year to America West. But he stressed that the airline would remain independent, along with its separate Phoenix hub and headquarters. The reorganisation is backed by a consortium called Am-West Partners. This is led by Air Partners, the investment group that brought Continental out of bankruptcy. One of Air Partners' principals is Mr David Bonderman, Continental's non-executive chairman. Other investors in AmWest Partners are Continental itself; Mesa Airlines, a regional carrier based in New Mexico; and Fidelity Investments, a specialist in bankruptcy rescues. AmWest Partners will invest up to Dollars 244.9m in return for a 33.5 per cent stake in America West. The unsecured creditors, who rejected an earlier plan offering them 45 per cent of the company, will now get 59.5 per cent; current shareholders will get 5 per cent; and GPA Group, a secured creditor, will get 2 per cent. Although this structure appears to leave AmWest Partners with a minority stake in America West, some of its shares carry more votes than the other shareholders', giving it more than 70 per cent of the votes. Continental Airlines, which froze employees' pay and then cut it while in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, said it was resuming pay increases  - but also said it would cut 1,000 jobs from its workforce of 43,000 over the next few months.</p>

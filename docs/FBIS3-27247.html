The report  on the findings of the provincial trade union organisation's  investigation is the latest in a lengthy series of studies  lambasting foreign-funded firms and joint ventures for their  treatment of Chinese workers.    Some 18 percent of workers at the 20 firms investigated by  the union in the southern Chinese province said they had been  regularly beaten or insulted, the report published in  International Business News said. Twenty-five percent had had  their identification cards confiscated by the management, and 37  percent had been threatened with the loss of their jobs for  complaining. Forty percent had never signed a contract, the  report said, adding that 61 percent of the workers put in a  seven-day week, averaging eight to 10 working hours a day.    The investigation also found evidence to back up repeated  allegations that foreign-funded firms put profits before safety  as they rush to grab a slice of China's economic boom. Some 36  percent of the workers had received no training in safety  regulations, while 44 percent had no medical or industrial  accident insurance. More than 10 percent of the 206 large-scale  industrial fires in China last year involved foreign-funded  firms.    Two fires within a month at the end of 1993 killed 80  employees in a Hong Kong-funded toy factory in the southern  special economic zone of Shenzhen and 64 workers in a  Taiwan-funded textile plant in the eastern city of Fuzhou. Most  of the victims were female factory workers.    The investigation found that 47 percent of the women workers  were denied maternity leave, and any who failed to return to  work soon after giving birth were automatically fired.    The union said its inquiry revealed a total disregard for  Chinese laws and regulations, and it also blamed local  authorities for failing to curb exploitation. Local labour  rules in China follow general guidelines set by the central  authorities and are often loosely implemented.    The eastern province of Shandong recently became the first  Chinese province to publish its own set of regulations governing  employment conditions in foreign-funded enterprises.</p>

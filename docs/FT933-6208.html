			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Where vulgarity is a virtue: Blackpool is the genuine article, says Nicholas Woodsworth FROM TIME to time, I have dipped a toe into the waters of Britain's seaside resorts. No matter how I disdain the boardwalk for its vulgarity and seediness I am, at the same time, attracted to it for precisely those reasons. So why not, I decided, pay a visit to the oldest and biggest of all promenades in Britain? Result: on a recent Friday evening, I caught a train northwards. Three hours later, I alighted in exotic Blackpool, mother of all British seaside resorts. Perhaps it was the knifing wind and fine, cold drizzle that blew in off the sea, sending sweet papers and cigarette packets swirling; perhaps it was the recession. Either way, an inescapable air of weariness enveloped the small shops and businesses, the half-empty B&amp;Bs, the down-at-heel pubs along my way. As I walked through back streets towards a Blackpool Tower obscured by mist, I felt suddenly glum. I could not help thinking that the special atmosphere of the English coastal resort might have become superfluous. Who needs seaside seediness now that it has seeped its way inland, through the entire country? Where is the fun in vulgarity if it has worked its way into the highest social and political circles? There are times, these days, when all Britain seems gripped by the ethos of the penny arcade. Not even a short stroll along the Golden Mile itself - the long band of fast-food kiosks, amusement arcades, souvenir shops and jostling crowds that fronts the sea - cheered me. The chip shops smelled of stale oil. The souvenirs looked grubby and pawed-over. Braving a ghastly electronic howl, I stuck my head into an amusement arcade. I did not really expect it, but there was not a coconut shy, a dart or hoop or skittle in sight; the fun seemed centred on video-screen games featuring heavily-armed psychopaths trying to kill each other. Not even the real people looked happy. Groups of loud youths blundered by with beer bottles in hand. Elderly women wandered aimlessly out of bingo halls into the rain. In the restaurant beside the tower, I queued behind a man and wife in bright nylon shell suits, a baby sealed in a plastic-covered pram between them. They consumed their Big Macs joylessly and left without a word. I had a Big Mac, too, and ruminated. Was this a final picture of England, supine and spiritless? Had the cheer gone even from the cheap and cheerful? Not at all, said Barbara Rocks, when I asked her what she thought. It was simply the rain and grey weather. Recession or no, Blackpool remains a place where you can find a bit of fun. Barbara, for eight years proprietress of the Norwin B&amp;B, is a level-headed Scot and immediately dispelled my moodiness. Besides, her spotless little establishment, from the plastic flowers in the dining room to the coloured lights in the bay window, struck just the right note. So did Barbara. I like being called dear and told not to fret. Tomorrow, I was promised, would be a brighter day. And it was. How, I wondered as I strolled towards the promenade, could I have doubted the town's resolve to see the rest of the country through its lowest moments? The world at large might be down in the dumps but, if sea-front hoardings and advertising are anything to go by, Blackpool is one great laugh of a place. Without leaving town I could watch the Hilarious Jolley Brothers, Nick Miller's Comedy Store, Roy Walker's Family Laughter Show, the duo Joka, the funnymen Little and Large, the Shamrock Music and Laughter Show, Chubby Brown, Bernard Manning, and scores of other comedy routines. There were singers, dancers, musicians, magicians, ventriloquists and every other kind of performer; making people laugh, though, is Blackpool's real talent. Low-brow mass entertainment? Perhaps. But then, Blackpool is about temporary escape, simple relief from the monotony and enforced dullness of working-class life. And who needs Godot in Blackpool? There is enough of the surreal about the place as it is. Summer, for example, is not a season in Blackpool but an attitude. In the stiff breeze on the promenade, young couples in shorts and T-shirts strolled hand-in-hand as if whiling away time on the French Riviera. Wind-whipped but undaunted, the elderly reclined gingerly in rented canvas chairs. I enjoyed walking the piers. On Central Pier, I circled round and round on a Ferris wheel while, far below, bumper cars bumped and the surf crashed to the theme song of Hawaii Five-0. On the Victorian-style North Pier, where a small tram runs between little white pavilions with green onion domes, there are still a few traditional games of skill left. I threw hoops over bottles, fired corks from pistols, aimed balls at moving targets. I could not even set foot in Harry Ramsden's famous fish restaurant, so great were the queues that evening. Instead, I bought a bag of rock cod and chips from the take-out counter and parked myself on a bench not far away. Why is it that strange women never make saucy remarks to me when I sit on public benches in London? Perhaps there is safety in numbers - Blackpool is a place where whole office-loads of secretaries, entire shops-full of sales assistants, choose to unwind. I am not sure I could take more than two or three days of Blackpool. There are times when the rain falls, the wind blows, and not even the most successful fantasist could pretend he was on the Riviera. Then, one is forced indoors with hordes of sodden holiday-makers, and it all becomes too much. What Blackpool has, above all, is amiability. My last evening was spent at a show at the Layton Institute, a working men's club some distance from the Golden Mile. The singing was mediocre, the humour parochial. But the atmosphere was as warm and sociable as anything I have encountered in Britain. In London, I live surrounded by people of cool, off-handed mien. It is a city where outsiders rarely feel entirely at home. But, in Blackpool, I felt at home in five minutes. Beneath the seediness and vulgarity, it has a strength of popular culture that, even in tough times, can make the airs and pretensions of London seem gaudy.</p>

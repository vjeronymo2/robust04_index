			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: Tory quiz - Ballot Box The campaign is testing candidates' ingenuity to its limits, if this flyer from the Conservative candidate in Wimbledon is anything to go by: 'Play the Wimbledon general election quiz with Charles Goodson-Wickes. 'Q1: Which two Johns, in their time, knew the buildings at Rutlish very well? 'Q2: In which year did Horatio Nelson move to Merton Place? 'Q3: Where is the All England Lawn Tennis Club thinking of moving to, if the Labour council doesn't help them? 'Q4: How many Liberal councillors are there on Merton Council?' Quite how asking these questions - to which answers are not provided - will help Goodson-Wickes is not clear. On the other hand, he should not need much help. He won just over 50 per cent of the vote last time, with the old Alliance down at 27 per cent in second place.</p>

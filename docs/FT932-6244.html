			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / ADT's Ashcroft paid Pounds 2m in 1992 despite shares slide MR Michael Ashcroft, chairman and chief executive of ADT, the Bermuda-based security and car auction company, was paid more than Pounds 2m in 1992, according to documents filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. During 1991 and 1992 ADT's market capitalisation has nearly halved to about Pounds 617m. Details of Mr Ashcroft's salary emerged as ADT entered the last stages of a Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 833m) refinancing with its banks and preference share holders. His service agreement states that 'his salary shall not be reduced' although he or the company can give 12 months notice terminating the contract. The 1992 payment was made up of Pounds 1.44m in salary and Pounds 596,000 paid in trust for Mr Ashcroft in lieu of retirement and death benefits. His salary was the same in 1991 and Pounds 1.2m in 1990. The compensation package makes Mr Ashcroft better paid than most chief executives in the FT-SE 100. ADT made a pre-tax profit in 1992 of Dollars 116m and a pre-tax loss of Dollars 460m in 1991. It is understood the ADT board has approved a new five-year service agreement with Mr Ashcroft, details of which are unlikely to be made available until the company files details of its annual report with the SEC next May. ADT has had a rocky recent stock market history. While the quality of its core security and car auction businesses has not been called into serious question, the group has stumbled on a string of non-core investments. These have included stakes in Christies, the auction house, and LEP, the freight and security company, on which the company has lost money. Mr Ashcroft, who established close links with the Conservative party, fell badly out of favour in the City during 1991. Unable to keep up with ADT's stream of non-core investments and inter-company transfers of assets and debts, he was described by analysts as 'too clever by half'. The share price fall was not simply due to a loss of confidence in the City. In April 1991 the company was hit with a lawsuit from Laidlaw of Canada, its largest shareholder. The suit claimed ADT had produced 'an illusory profit stream' but was dropped, apparently in return for board representation. Mr Ashcroft transformed ADT in the late 1980s from a string of office service companies with low margins to a company with leading positions in the security market in the US and in car auctions on both sides of the Atlantic. But the cost of buying these businesses was partly met through the issue of convertible preference shares which included put options, exercisable in 1994, significantly above the current share price of 560p. Some Dollars 435m falls due under the convertibles issue and the balance of the Dollars 1.3bn being covered in the refinancing was due to banks from 1995. ADT said in the documents filed with the SEC that if the refinancing was not implemented it would cut capital spending or 'if necessary consider the disposition of operating businesses in whole or in part'.</p>

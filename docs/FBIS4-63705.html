			<p>BFN     [Text] The brief meeting between Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk and British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd in Kiev on  Tuesday [24 May] will focus on settlement of the Crimean issue.  This was said by Hurd himself in an interview with INTERFAX in  Murmansk.    Hurd suggested that this issue must be considered within the  scope of development of friendly relations between Great Britain  and Ukraine. Hurd recommended that talks on Crimea be held in  the presence of the Russian party which could contribute to  better understanding between Kiev and Simferopol through its  calm and constructive participation. "We hope that both parties  are reasonable enough to solve the problem by peaceful methods,"  Hurd said.</p>

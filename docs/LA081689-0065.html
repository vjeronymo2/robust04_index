			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong's teeming detention centers are threatened by  malnutrition and disease, the top U.N. refugee official in the colony said.  Robert van Leeuwen called for better food and "a massive immunization campaign"  for "boat people" being housed on an outlying island and on five ferries in  Hong Kong's harbor. Van Leeuwen based his statements on a preliminary report by  U.N. officials about camps housing 6,700 of Hong Kong's 51,000 refugees.  Convinced that their quest for a new life is over, 124 of the refugees have  volunteered to return to their homeland.  </P></p>

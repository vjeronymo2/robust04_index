			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Foreign Firms Allowed To Engage in </F> Wholesale Business and Set Up Foreign Trade Companies in  Shanghai"]    [Text] Shanghai, 7 Apr (LIEN HO PAO)--Shanghai recently  decided to allow foreign firms to engage in wholesale business  and to set up foreign trade companies. The adoption of this  policy will not only mark a major reform step in the opening of  the mainland's tertiary industry, but will also greatly promote  development in the Chang Jiang Valley.    Reportedly, the details of the scheme for implementing the  decision are being formulated intensively.    In the course of expanding the scope of using foreign funds,  apart from opening wholesale business, foreign trade, and retail  sales of producer goods to foreign companies, Shanghai will also  allow mainland retailers to launch joint ventures and carry out  cooperation with foreign chain stores.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- The governing coalition  Friday [20 May] sketched out an official view concerning the  definition of a controversial phrase on Japan's defense policy  that has been under parliamentary fire from the opposition.    The wording "universal security" was inserted into a common  policy platform document under an April 22 agreement by  coalition parties as a prerequisite for launching the coalition  government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata.    The document of policy coordination commitments said the  coalition "recognizes the fact that the Japanese Constitution  adopts as its ideal universal security (to be guaranteed) by the  United Nations, while it allows Japan to actively join U.N.  activities for peace and maintain the Japan-U.S. Security  Treaty."    The day's announcement defined the wording as "the whole  framework of measures for maintaining peace and security to be  taken by the United Nations."    It said the coalition decided to use the adjective  "universal," as the perception of such measures for maintaining  the security of a country "is taken as a matter of course by the  whole international community."    The announcement also defined another disputed phrase,  "collective security," the clarification of which has been  demanded by opposition interpellators in House of  Representatives sessions since May 11.    It defined collective security as "appropriate measures  taken  in solidarity by the international community, in order to  restore peace, against a country or group which invades another  or destroys or threatens peace."    It called attention to the U.N. Charter as the reference  document that "stipulates concrete measures" for restoring peace.    Hata earlier told a Diet session that the perception of  universal security is identical to that of collective security.    However, the announcement said Japan is under the  constraints  of its Constitution "when Japan participates in or cooperates  with U.N. activities designed to restore peace and security."    Article 9 of the Constitution bars Japan from using military  forces to resolve international disputes.</p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Unisys offshoot to handle Co-op Bank's payment processing The Co-operative Bank has entered into an agreement with Unisys, the US computer manufacturer, to split off its payment processing function into a wholly owned Unisys sub-sidiary. Unisys plans to invest in new computer systems for the company, which will be made up of the 200 Co-op staff who handle payment processing. The initial investment could total between Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m. Co-op already handles paper payment processing for several other financial organisations including Post Office Counters and some building societies. The new company will make a priority of seeking to expand its third-party business, including the processing of transactions involving paper other than cheques, such as invoices. The marketing effort will target other, non-financial, organisations such as local authorities and charities, which may have to deal with a large number of paper transactions. The move comes against a background of declining use of personal cheques, as people switch to making greater use of debit cards. Co-op has about 8 per cent of the paper processing market, dealing with about 300m pieces of paper each year. Including the Bank of England, there are 13 banks and other organisations which are members of the cheque and credit clearing committee. Some of these  -such as Co-op Bank - have relatively small shares of the market, and may seek similar deals. Mr Iain Davidson, head of financial services at Unisys, said he expected the number of clearers to fall to about five or six by the year 2000. Mr Terry Thomas, Co-op Bank managing director, said the new venture represented a way of being able to stabilise unit costs by increasing the volumes of paper processed. Mr Thomas said pressure on unit costs was such that for the next three or four years, even with increased volumes, it would be necessary to hold prices to third parties near existing levels. Only after that might it be possible to reduce prices. The initial contract between Co-op Bank and Unisys is for 10 years. The switch to the new operation is likely to take place in November. The change should not have any direct impact on customers, and Co-op Bank will still be a member of the clearing system.</p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Lloyds seeks small businesses'support in battle for Midland THE BATTLE for Midland Bank hotted up yesterday as Lloyds Bank launched a package aimed at persuading small businesses to support its takeover bid and issued a direct appeal to its rival's shareholders. The war of words continued when Sir Peter Walters, Midland's chairman, told MPs that a Lloyds takeover would mean retrenchment, not growth. Midland suffered a setback when the Takeover Panel said it could not appeal against an earlier ruling that Lloyds must be allowed access to confidential commercial information already supplied to Hongkong Bank. Lloyds yesterday unveiled what amounted to a manifesto to customers, saying what they would gain from a takeover of Midland. Small business customers of the combined bank would gain, said Lloyds, because banking services would be far superior to those already available in the UK. This was because a merged bank would operate more cheaply and efficiently than the existing UK clearers. The proposals followed recent widespread criticism of the clearing banks' treatment of small business customers. Small businesses would benefit from a new Pounds 100m Lloyds Bank venture fund administered in regional centres. It would enable them to obtain venture capital of Pounds 5,000 and above as well as a new fixed-rate lending scheme, backed by a Pounds 250m fund, making cash available for between five and seven years. The bank promised a scheme to enable small businesses to obtain cash when large companies were late in payment. Lloyds also said it would not make banking tariff charges in the two years after a business was set up. Mr Bernard Asher, director of Hongkong Bank, said he expected that his bank's bid for Midland would result in services to small businesses at least as good as those promised by Lloyds. Lloyds' proposals were immediately attacked by Mr Stan Mendham, chairman of the Forum of Private Business. He said Midland shareholders should question carefully the motives behind Lloyds' proposed takeover bid. 'Why is this range of beneficial measures only possible under a hostile bid for Midland?' Mr Mendham asked. Battle for Midland, Page 10 Lex, Page 24</p>

			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOMELESS FAMILIES  </P> <P> Your articles on homeless families (Oct. 15 and 16) move me and prompt my  speaking up.  </P> <P> Affordable housing for low-income people is nearly impossible to find these  days. The National Coalition for the Homeless estimates that as many as 3  million Americans are homeless today. And a recent Congressional study  indicates that if the current trend continues, as many as 19 million people may  be homeless within the next 14 years.  </P> <P> Millions of U.S. apartments now receive federal subsidies under contracts that  are about to expire and hundreds of thousands of others are receiving mortgage  subsidies that soon will allow private, profit-motivated owners to convert the  properties to condominiums or high-income rentals, displacing the renters.  </P> <P> Housing Now sent a loud and urgent message to Congress and the Bush  Administration.  </P> <P> Housing Now is part of a nationwide, ongoing demand that every American have  decent, affordable housing. Our job as citizens is to create the political will  with our elected officials that will make it happen.  </P> <P> MARGUERITE PETERSON  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

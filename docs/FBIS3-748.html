			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Information Service of </F> Bophuthatswana on 12 March on the SAPA PR Wire Service]    [Text] The Bophuthatswana authorities announced today that  murder charges will brought against those allegedly responsible  for the execution of two members of the AWB [Afrikaner  Weerstandsbeweging; Afrikaner Resistance Movement], after a  confrontation with the Bophuthatswana Security Forces in  Mmabatho on Friday [11 March]. Major-General Jack Turner, chief  of the Bophuthatswana Defence Force (BDF), said a full-scale  investigation had been launched to identify the killers and to  bring them to justice. If necessary, the investigation would be  broadened to include independent participation.    General Turner said: "We are filled with revulsion at this  horrific incident. This sort of summary and barbaric action  forms no part of the protective and peacekeeping role for which  the security forces of this country are responsible and we are  duty- bound to bring the culprits to book. We are now studying  video film material taken at the scene by TV media personnel  prior to the shooting incident, to see if this can materially  assist us with the investigation and to identify the  perpetrators. We are also appealing to those who have  information which could assist us with the investigation to come  forward as soon as possible. Their information will be treated  in the strictest confidence. We would like this murder  investigation to be as transparent and open as the law will  permit. I can give the categoric assurance that once we have  ascertained all the relevant facts, a murder docket will be  opened by the Bophuthatswana Police and the alleged killer or  killers will be brought before the courts as soon as possible."    General Turner also announced that strong disciplinary  action, including legal prosecutions if warranted, would be  taken against those members of the security forces who had  allegedly been involved in the harassment and assault of members  of the media, while they were carrying out their professional  duties. General Turner said no stone would be left unturned in  identifying the culprits. Members of the media who wished to  provide information which could assist with this inquiry, as  well the investigation into the shooting incident involving the  AWB members, could contact him on: tel: (0140) 861828 fax:  (0140) 863419.    With reference to the presence and deployment of AWB  contingents inside Bophuthatswana this week, General Turner  emphasised that these AWB members had been operating inside the  country without the consent of the Bophuthatswana authorities,  and had not consulted or liaised with the security forces as to  their entry into the country. General Turner said that late on  Thursday evening, he had been alerted to the fact that  heavily-armed AWB members in bakkies [pickup trucks] had  assembled at Rooigrond, about 20kms from Mmabatho, under the  command of AWB leader, Eugene Terreblance. He had instructed  Colonel Manne Botes of the BDF to proceed to Rooigrond to tell  Mr Terreblance that his forces were not welcome in  Bophuthatswana and to immediately withdraw his men, as well as  those already in Mmabatho itself. Mr Terreblance's reaction was  that he "did not take orders from colonels."    "Subsequently, Mr Terreblance was accompanied to Mmabatho  where I personally made it clear to him that he and his men  should leave the country immediately as their presence here  would create friction and pose problems for us. In addition, I  told him that our security forces were dead set against the  presence of the AWB in Bophuthatswana. Mr Terreblance was  visibly upset and claimed that his offer of assistance was being  spurned, but after lengthy discussions, he agreed to leave with  his men. Regrettably, he reneged on this undertaking, and we  later received several reports of incidents in which AWB members  were involved in random shooting forays, as well as harassing  troops and making racial insults. All this had the effect of  increasing tensions and stirring up deep emotions among the  local public and the security forces."    General Turner added that on Friday, while BDF troops were  on  parade at the Molopo military base in Mmabatho, the AWB had  deployed in the veld outside the base and had opened fire on his  men. Fortunately, no-one had been hurt. The overall situation  had also been aggravated by the fact that unidentified elements  in RSA [Republic of South Africa]-registered cars had been  cruising the streets of Mmabatho/Mafikeng, firing at random on  civilian homes and properties with automatic weapons.    General Turner said that once agreement had been reached to  allow the SADF [South African Defense Force], the BDF and the  Bophuthatswana Police to conduct joint security operations  within Bophuthatswana, these forces had worked throughout the  night to clear the area of unruly elements and to restore  stability.    General Turner said he also wished to clarify the position  regarding the presence of Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner  National Front] (AVF) forces inside Bophuthatswana. He said  General Constand Viljoen had offered the assistance of  Volksfront troops under the command of experienced leadership,  to protect public buildings and strategic installations. The  Bophuthatswana Security Council initially accepted this offer,  with the strict qualification that the AVF forces be assembled  at a specified gathering point, to be used only in this  protective role, should the need arise. A force of about 1,000  AVF men were duly assembled on Friday, under strict supervision,  at a military air base about 20 kms outside Mmabatho. They  proceeded directly to the base and were not involved in any of  Friday's security force operations. At about 5PM on Friday,  after consultation with General Viljoen, the AVF was requested  by the Bophuthatswana authorities to depart and their convoy was  escorted from Bophuthatswana under the guidance of the BDF.    General Turner said he wished to express his sincere  sympathies to the families and relatives of all those who had  been killed or injured during the unrest in Bophuthatswana in  the past few days.</p>

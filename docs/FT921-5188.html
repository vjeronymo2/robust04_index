			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report New York's nearby arabica coffee contract was 2 cents down in early afternoon trading on profit taking and some selling from origin as the market retreated from Tuesday's sharply higher close. Traders said there was little news from Costa Rica, where coffee ministers from Central America, Colombia and Mexico are meeting to discuss options on renewing international price supports. London robustas closed off the highs struck earlier, when May touched Dollars 844. Dealers noted that only 27 lots of dollar and 426 lots of sterling have been delivered since March became tenderable on Monday, partly because much of the coffee seems to be in the hands of companies under little pressure to sell. On the LME nickel closed just ahead; dealers said the market's uninterrupted recent decline, which has taken prices down some Dollars 700, was finally reversed at midsession as active fund buying and short covering emerged at the key Dollars 7,400 level for three-month metal - a new eight week low. Earlier losses were sparked by producer selling and sell-stops, with option-linked selling adding to the pressure. The steep falls brought many March puts into-the-money, prompting hedge selling ahead of the morning's declarations. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISSING MANNERS  </P> <P> Recently, we were shopping at a Trader Joe's. The people in the car parked next  to us forcefully opened their door, hitting our car.  </P> <P> When we got out to inspect it, the driver started screaming obscenities at us,  ordering us to "Never park in a shopping mall again," and demanding to know  "What's your insurance company!?"  </P> <P> I did not favor a reply, but simply wrote down his license number in case he  resorted to physical violence against my audacity of parking my car in the way  of his door.  </P> <P> When I reported this, the police would not take the report because no "crime"  had been committed. I know it's a rhetorical question, but isn't the purpose of  law to uphold the quality of life (as defined by the lawmakers)? If so, where  are the laws that protect us rational and considerate citizens from such  "quality of life" criminals?  </P> <P> ARLO CHAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

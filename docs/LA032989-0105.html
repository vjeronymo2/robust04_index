			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S&amp;L ASSETS WON'T BE DUMPED -- BRADY;  </P> <P> SECRETARY SEEKS TO ASSURE PROPERTY OWNERS IN TEXAS, CALIFORNIA  </P> <P> Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady on Tuesday sought to assure property  owners in states such as Texas and California that federal regulators will not  "dump" real estate on local markets when they sell the assets of insolvent  savings and loan institutions under President Bush's S&amp;L rescue plan.  </P> <P> On a one-day trip to Texas, one of the states hardest hit by S&amp;L failures,  Brady said regulators "intend to proceed very carefully" when they begin  selling property in order to avoid sending real prices of homes and commercial  structures plunging. "The government also has a vested interest in avoiding  dumping and (in) receiving the best possible price for the real estate," he  said. "We won't necessarily be in a hurry to sell it off."  </P> <P> Brady also warned Congress, which will begin work on the S&amp;L legislation  next week, not to try to finance the whole $50-billion cost of the Bush  Administration's S&amp;L rescue plan in a single up-front appropriation, as  some lawmakers want, because that would risk blowing apart the effort to reduce  the federal budget deficit.  </P> <P> During a series of speeches and press conferences here and in Houston, Brady  said to do so would push total government outlays far above the spending  ceilings established under the Gramm-Rudman budget law and would "completely .  . . render a sham the budgetary discipline" that the government is seeking.  </P> <P> That in turn would send interest rates up sharply and push the government's own  borrowing costs out of control, he contended. "If interest rates rise by as  little as one-tenth of a percentage point," he said, it would "overwhelm any  cost savings" that might come from financing the S&amp;L rescue package all at  once instead of stretching it out over several years.  </P> <P> Despite Brady's concern over what Congress might do about the financing issue,  the lawmakers are expected to act speedily next month to approve the  Administration's S&amp;L rescue plan and most likely will make only minor  changes. Those calling for Congress to appropriate the money in one action  contend that it would save money on interest costs.  </P> <P> A House Banking subcommittee is scheduled to start formal drafting of a bill  next week, and the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee is  scheduled to begin work on its version of the measure the week after.  Congressional leaders say they expect to send a final version of the  legislation to Bush's desk some time in May.  </P> <P> The secretary's remarks were designed to head off any last-minute snags that  might arise in congressional handling of the S&amp;L issue. Brady said later  that, while he does not consider the financing issue a major one, he could "see  it as (one) that could provoke endless debate" if it were permitted to get out  of hand.  </P> <P> He also warned that if lawmakers were to approve breaching the Gramm-Rudman  spending ceilings for the S&amp;L rescue plan, it would open the door for  exceptions in a variety of other areas, from increased spending on social  programs to larger defense outlays. He called the proposal to appropriate the  entire $50 billion in one fiscal year "a stupid idea."  </P> <P> Brady's trip Tuesday was designed to promote the S&amp;L package in heavily  affected Texas and to calm nervous property owners who are worried about the  possibility that aggressive selling of S&amp;L assets might send local real  estate values tumbling.  </P> <P> On a related issue, Brady said the Treasury intends to stand firm against  pressure from some lawmakers that it postpone the mid-1991 deadline, by which  the Administration's plan would require savings and loan institutions to meet  stiffer capitalization standards.  </P> <P> Although some legislators argue that the deadline is unrealistically close,  Brady contended Tuesday that the Administration's plan provides for granting  exceptions to some troubled S&amp;Ls. But he said that any extensions should be  allowed on a case-by-case basis. He argued that extending the deadline for all  thrifts would only reduce the pressure on those institutions to put their  economic houses in order.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Friday sermon by Shaykh 'Abd-al-'Aziz Bin-'Abdallah al- </F> Shaykh, member of the council of senior ulema, to hajj pilgrims  at Namirah Mosque, near Mecca -- live]    [Excerpts] Brothers: May God's peace and benediction be on  you [passage omitted].    O nation of Islam: Look at the sedition in the ranks of the  Muslim nation. There is sedition as well as wars, internecine  fighting and mutual destruction in a number of Muslim countries.  Sedition which has led to loss of life, property and the  destruction of the country. But who benefits from all this?  Muslims should fear God and their religion; they should spare  the destruction of their people and should remember that God  will be questioning them on the sedition and the wars and He  will be judging them on that sedition. O nation of Islam, you  should fear God.    Let us go back to the teachings of our true religion. Let us  make God's teachings an arbiter in our problems. Let us think  and contemplate that such sedition will not bring any good to  our nation. It will only bring destruction to property and  people. And it will only sow the seeds of hatred between  members of the nation. It will make it less united and it will  destroy its resources. You should, O nation of Islam, fear God,  use your wisdom and try to avoid sedition. Nothing good will  ever come from sedition. [passage omitted]    O nation of Islam, nation of Islam: The enemies of the  nation  have been trying to discredit it by claiming that Islam has  ignored human rights and that the latter has been ignored in  Muslim faith. This is a lie and a fallacy. Anyone who cares to  examine our faith will find out that it is the faith which has  guaranteed the true meaning of human rights. God has said to  his messenger: We have sent thee, save as a mercy unto all  beings. [passage omitted]    Human rights have been guaranteed under our faith. Creeds  before Islam used to fight each other. Whenever a creed  triumphed over another one it tried to annihilate it as much as  it could. But once God sent Muhammad, may God's prayers and  benedictions be upon him, as a mercy to the nation and to  humanity... Hence, human rights are respected by our shari'ah  and by the Muslim faith. Believers must, however, obey the  shari'ah; they must obey its divine ordinance on what is  permitted and what is not. Their religion has urged them to do  so. The true Muslim is someone who would not harm other Muslims  by words or deeds. [last sentence from the hadith] [passage  omitted]    Our religion has protected human rights for everybody and  those who claim respect for human rights are the ones who are  the enemies of mankind, the ones whose societies gave birth to  racial and ethnic discrimination, the ones who are making  weapons of destruction so that the Islamic nations use them to  eliminate one another. They are the ones who ignite sedition.  Islam, with its tenets, is innocent of the terrible events and  horrible massacres which one sees around. [passage omitted:  Islam is against dishonesty and treacherous behavior; giving  examples from the prophet's behaviour]    Islam is a religion of mercy, justice, and equity, and those  who (?allege) that Islam relinquishes the human rights of  Muslims and non-Muslims are deceiving people. Islam protects  the very meaning of human rights. [passage omitted: the ummah  and its leaders are abiding by the Islamic law as dictated by  the Holy Book]    Muslims should not listen to the ideas, deceptions, and  calumnies of the enemies of Islam. They must trust their  religion and know that their Islam is God's religion, which  Allah chose and entrusted his messenger to convey. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Rao tries to end market scandal The Indian government yesterday rejected a parliamentary committee's demands for further punitive action against those allegedly involved in the 1992 Rs40bn (Pounds 816m) Bombay securities market scandal. In a report presented to parliament, the government sought to end argument over the scandal by spelling out the punishments already imposed on individuals and institutions and the regulatory changes made to improve operation of the securities market. The government was responding to an all-party parliamentary report presented last December demanding tough action. But the opposition parties, which have sensed the ruling Congress (I) party is vulnerable to accusations of corruption and financial incompetence, yesterday pledged to keep up the attack. The opposition parties want the resignations of the health minister, Mr B. Shankaranand, who was oil minister during the scandal, and of Mr Romeshwar Thakur, rural development minister, who was a junior finance minister in 1992. In an all-party parliamentary report into the scandal presented last year, Mr Shankaranand was accused of having authorised various money transfers when, as oil minister, he headed the state-owned Oil Industry Development Board. Mr Thakur was accused of having delayed investigations. Demands for their resignations have become entwined with calls for the resignation of Mr Kalpnath Rai, food minister, blamed in a government report for the mishandling of a sugar shortage this year. The demands have left Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao in an awkward position because he wants to clean the party's image following recent state elections in which it fared badly, partly because of voters' anger at alleged corruption. Mr Rao has not dismissed the ministers for fear of splitting the party leadership. Congress MPs believe he still hopes to organise a Cabinet reshuffle to camouflage any sackings. In yesterday's report, the government detailed measures taken to improve banking supervision, including the setting-up of a Board of Financial Supervision within the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, and rules to improve transparency in stock market trading. It listed officials and bank executives dismissed or moved because of the scandal and said criminal cases had been lodged against 96 individuals. In rejecting the parliamentary committee's demands for cancellation or suspension of licences for foreign banks alleged to have been involved in the scandal, substantial punishment, including financial penalties, were said to have been imposed already.</p>

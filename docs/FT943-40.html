			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Trade and the World Economy (33): Prices swings raise doubts - Oil / Distortions have masked robust growth in demand The influential role of oil prices in the world economy was vividly illustrated last February, when the price of the benchmark Brent Blend fell to a five-year low of about Dollars 13 a barrel. In the US, the world's largest energy market, low crude oil prices were quickly passed on to industry and consumers in the form of lower petrol and diesel prices, thus helping to ensure that the rapid economic expansion steamed ahead without inflationary worries. But the economic effect of oil prices falling to their lowest real level since 1973 was markedly different in many petroleum exporting countries. They were forced to make sharp cuts in public expenditure as export revenues plummetted. At the same time some analysts predicted that oil prices could collapse to single digits, a prospect that prompted speculation about possible civil unrest in populous but poor members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, such as Nigeria and Iran. Those price forecasts have since been proved wrong. Prices moved steadily upwards, to reach a high for the year so far of about Dollars 19.40 a barrel in early August, as the market reacted to fears that supplies from Nigeria would be cut due to a politically-motivated strike. But even a four-month price rally was not enough to bring Opec revenues back to last year's levels. At the end of August the cumulative revenues of the organisation's members were still about Dollars 15bn, or 18 per cent lower than those recorded to the end of August 1993, according to the Petroleum Finance Company, a consultancy based in Washington DC The collapse of the Nigerian strike in early September caused prices to fall back to their present level of Dollars 16-Dollars 17 a barrel. But volatility on the scale seen this year has left oil producers and consumers alike wondering about the direction of long-term price trends. The conventional view is that both medium and long-term prices should gradually increase as demand strengthens in line with economic recovery in the main industrialised countries. Although world oil demand fell by about 0.8 per cent in 1993, Peter Davies, British Petroleum's chief economist, says the figure was distorted by the unprecedented collapse of demand in the former Soviet Union, where consumption fell by about a fifth. Oil demand in the rest of the world grew by about 1.4 per cent, a 'robust' rate according to Mr Davies. Most forecasts suggest that demand outside the former Soviet Union will continue to rise. The Paris-based International Energy Agency says oil demand in the industrialised countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development could increase to 45m barrels a day by 2010. That represents an 18 per cent increase over 1991, but an annual growth rate of just 0.8 per cent a year Oil demand in the rest of the world, however, is expected to grow on average by nearly 4 per cent a year. Growth will be especially buoyant in fast-growing Asian economies, such as China, which BP economists expect will overtake Russia some time this year as the world's second largest energy market. China has also become a net oil importer. That is a significant development for future oil prices, given forecasts which show China importing more than 1m barrels a day by 2000. The prospect of steady, strong demand for oil comes at a time of high capacity utilisation among leading producers. World oil consumption is running at about 65m barrels a day, but there is probably only about 2m-3m b/d of surplus capacity, mostly in the big Opec producers of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. The lack of surplus capacity is one of the main reasons why Opec's notoriously weak commitment to national production quotas has been maintained this year. It also explains why world markets drove oil prices to year-to-date highs in August when traders feared that strikes would stop 1.6m b/d of Nigerian exports from reaching international consumers. Supply worries should help to underpin prices in the short term, as long as Opec maintains reasonably strong production discipline and there is no early return to the world markets of Iraqi crude oil, subject to a United Nations embargo. Saudi Arabia, the largest exporter, is keen to see prices move closer to the Dollars 18-Dollars 22 a barrel level. That, Saudi officials say, would be a high enough price range to satisfy Opec's need for greater oil revenues, but low enough to avoid inflationary pressures in the industrialised world. Such a range would also be in keeping with Saudi Arabia's long-term strategy to keep oil competitive against alternative fuels. Such stable pricing policies, however, are likely to draw opposition from more populous Opec price hawks, such as Iran. But although the world's dependence on Opec will grow towards the end of the decade, there are a number of short-to-medium-term factors which could keep oil prices in a relatively steady price range. The end of the cold war and a wave of privatisations in many developing countries have opened up an unprecedented number of opportunities for oil companies, with oil-producing countries increasingly competing for foreign investment and access to western technology. Although many companies have experienced political problems in promising areas such as Russia and other republics of the former Soviet Union, a steady stream of new, large export-oriented fields in non-Opec countries is expected to be developed in coming years. The surge in non-Opec production will eventually tail off. But oil companies are proving to be particularly adept at developing new technology to extend the productive life of existing reservoirs well beyond original estimates. Some analysts believe such technological and market forces are strong enough to keep prices within a relatively low band of Dollars 15-Dollars 20 a barrel in real terms. But the growing importance of paper markets in setting prices means that price swings could still be sudden and wide.</p>

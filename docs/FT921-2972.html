			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / International Company News: Schroders Asia sued over Paladin's NZE takeover SCHRODERS Asia, the Hong Kong merchant bank 75 per cent owned by Schroder of the UK, has become the first financial adviser in Hong Kong to face major legal proceedings for alleged negligence. Paladin, a Hong Kong investment company, served a writ against Schroders Asia yesterday, claiming damages of HKDollars 100.6m (USDollars 13m) as a result of the merchant bank's role as adviser to its previous directors and independent committee on the acquisition of New Zealand Equities (NZE). The New Zealand-listed company went into receivership in February 1990, seven months after Schroders' recommendation was given. Ms Lilian Oung, Paladin chairman, said yesterday: 'Paladin's legal advisers, in consultation with both Hong Kong and leading London counsel, have stated that they were quite satisfied that Schroders Asia has been grossly negligent in discharging its duties which has caused Paladin substantial loss and damage.' A Schroders Asia source said the company was 'relaxed' about the accusations and would 'vigorously' defend its position. The successful takeover of NZE led to a bitterly-contested battle for control of Paladin, eventually won by a minority shareholder group controlled by the Taiwanese Oung family. A number of former directors of Paladin were subsequently publicly censured and Schroders has been threatened with legal action a number of times, for its part in the NZE transaction. However, the Oung family has subsequently had its own difficulties. Paladin's former chairman, Mr James Oung, faced forgery charges in Taiwan last year, while the Hong Kong regulators blocked a HKDollars 335m share issue by Paladin, due to concerns over the 'adequacy of information' on its proposals.</p>

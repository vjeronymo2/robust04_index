			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Spokesman of the Prime Minister's Office Aphisit  Wetchachiwa says Thailand is closely following the U.S. move  about using Article 301 for trade retaliation. The government  thinks that international trade atmosphere has largely improved  following the conclusion of the Uruguay round of trade talks.  The APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] summit meeting was  also marked by a friendly atmosphere.    [Begin recording] [Aphisit] We must follow it closely to  see whether the move will be applied in general. We must be  prepared; it is the responsibility of the government that wants  to see a relaxed atmosphere in international trade.    [Unidentified correspondent] Is the U.S. measure meant as  pressure on this region?    [Aphisit] I think it concerns a particular problem. Anyway,  we cannot remain indifferent but have to follow the developments  and see whether there is a tendency toward unilateral  retaliation. As I have said, I believe there will be a  discussion on this matter at the preparations for the APEC  meeting.    [Correspondent] Will there be any discussion among ourselves  to prepare for the U.S. move?    [Aphisit] The Thai private sector and government are already  cooperating on that. It's the responsibility of Deputy Prime  Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak, in his capacity as head of the  International Economic Policy Office. There is no problem about  our preparations to cope with the consequences; we are already  working together on that. [end recording]</p>

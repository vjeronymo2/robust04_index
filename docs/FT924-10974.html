			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Deflated expectations If there is a bright spot in the CBI's latest industrial trends survey it must be the inflation outlook for the UK. Unit costs actually fell for the first time since the survey started 34 years ago, and, in spite of devaluation, more companies expect to cut prices than raise them over the coming quarter. Of course, that just emphasises how depressed the economy is; it would be wrong to assume that the increase in import costs will never feed through into domestic price rises. After a further dip, underlying inflation will probably be heading back up in the second half of next year. Companies are also taking heart from the export opportunities offered by sterling's fall. But given that the economic prospects for continental Europe continue to worsen, those hopes may be short-lived. That is unfortunate, because companies' investment intentions offer little hope of growth. Companies are embarking on another round of retrenchment, cutting both capital expenditure and labour forces. That leaves the poor consumer, who is as unlikely as ever to go on a spending spree as the threat of unemployment intensifies. It will take more than piecemeal interest rate cuts and jiggery-pokery with the funding rule at the Mansion House speech to get things moving.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["pop"-signed report: "East Europe Wants German Advisory </F> Assistance"]    [Text] Hamburg -- After experiences with English and U.S.  advisers that have not always been particularly good, the  Central and East European countries are now seeking the advice  of German experts and aid organizations more intensively. That  was what Walter Kittel, Federal Government representative for  advisory services in East Europe, said at an event organized by  the East and Central Europe Association in Hamburg. Over the  past year, the Federal Government has made German advisory  services more efficient and improved the coordination of the  provision of such services among participating ministries.  Kittel went on to say that the goal of advisory assistance was  to improve framework conditions for private economic activity  and the capacity to absorb international financial assistance.    The situation in the CIS countries above all has been shaped  by the fact that former command mechanisms for managing the  economy have collapsed along with the socialist structures. At  the same time, an appropriate free market economic system that  conforms to world markets has yet to be developed. A large part  of the funds available from the IMF, the World Bank, and the  East Europe Bank is blocked for that reason, Kittel said.    According to information provided by Kittel, the federal  budget for 1994 contains about 300 million German marks for  advisory assistance in East Europe. The allocation of the funds  will be coordinated by the Economics and Foreign Ministries,  distributed among eight fields of activity and 11 countries (the  Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, the Baltic  states, Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus) and further coordinated  with other donors, especially the European Union and  international financial institutions. In addition, the  distribution of about a third of the funds will require Kittel's  approval. In cooperation with each of the partner states,  medium- and long-term framework programs have been drawn up for  individual countries. At the beginning of 1994, the programs  contained more than 800 individual activities. The amounts that  the recipient countries will obtain are based on objective  criteria, including Germany's economic and foreign policy  interests. The projects are based on countries' needs, not on  the advisers' ideas, and focus on particular fields and regions,  Kittel said.    The Reconstruction Bank [KfW] is drawing up a program for  conducting assessments and suggesting improvements. The Federal  Government program is already oriented toward mobilizing at the  lowest possible cost the knowledge available and personnel  resources of the relevant organizations, such as the KfW, the  German Equalization Bank, the Society for Technical Cooperation,  the Trust Agency, as well as party and business foundations.    German business can profit from these advisory services in  that German investment will be sought in the partner countries  as a result of the export of German laws, the adoption of German  technical standards, and the identification and launching of  private cooperation projects. Viewed against this background,  Kittel said it was desirable to develop a symmetrical  relationship between German financial assistance and advisory  services. Whereas the Germans have borne about two-thirds of  the costs of financial assistance provided by the G-7 countries,  Germany's share of G-7 advisory services has only been 25  percent.</p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Management: Why it is the little things that matter so much  -Christopher Lorenz says that many attempts at corporate culture change are doomed to failure The past decade has seen a flood of articles, books and speeches trumpeting the importance of altering a company's culture to improve its competitive performance. There can hardly be a more popular buzz phrase today, except perhaps for 'total quality' and 'change management' - both of which themselves involve extensive culture change. So one would have thought that most top managers now realised that their companies can seldom achieve substantial strategic and organisational change without also altering their culture. They would also have some idea of how to achieve this. Not so. Whatever they may profess, many companies persist in their old, ineffective ways, trying to accomplish strategic change by merely changing the systems and structures of their organisation. They become preoccupied with its rational, 'hard' aspects. They fail to confront the fact that its decisions are often deeply influenced by 'soft' factors, notably the large number of unspoken assumptions and beliefs which managers in the organisation share about 'the way we do things around here'. As a result, their efforts to achieve change are resisted, and often fail. This is one of the main conclusions of a study carried out over several years by Gerry Johnson, a professor at Britain's Cranfield School of Management. Some of its results are reported in an article in Long Range Planning Journal* and others - including ways of overcoming the problem - were discussed in a set of papers presented at a recent conference on 'managing strategically', held jointly between Cranfield and the London-based Strategic Planning Society. 'Even when managers do realise the importance of culture,' Johnson complains, they try 'to reduce it to better communications, mission statements and notices hung on people's walls. 'That's not enough. Culture change needs to be made operational in all sorts of mundane and detailed ways,' he stresses. 'Unless it affects the day-to-day behaviour of individuals throughout the organisation, it won't work.' To help companies overcome this barrier, Johnson and his colleagues audit the various distinctive features of what he calls the organisation's 'culture web'. This brings to the surface, for discussion and potential change, such closely related 'soft' aspects of culture as: 'rituals and routines' (such as, in some consultancies, the 'need' for partners to sign anything that goes to clients ); 'stories and myths' (such as legendary leaders and mavericks, plus past successes and failures); 'symbols'. This covers not only obvious things such as separate dining rooms and parking spaces for top managers, and the addressing of top executives by their initials or 'sir'. It also includes company-specific language which reinforces entrenched attitudes. Among various colourful examples, Johnson cites a traditional tendency of British Rail planners to refer to passengers disparagingly as 'pedestrian freight'. Johnson's 'culture web' also covers the more widely- recognised 'hard' aspects of company culture, such as control systems, power structures and organisation structures. Culture audits of this kind are necessary, he says, because the unspoken aspects of culture tend not to be made explicit through the debates on strategy that normally take place within most organisations. This is partly why most companies only confront such 'taken-for-granted' facets - if at all  -when they hit a crisis, or when the chief executive stimulates one. 'The very surfacing of these blockages means you can start addressing the question of how you might change them', says Johnson. As an example of the intractable nature of unspoken cultural assumptions, beliefs and behaviour patterns in an organisation, Johnson cites the example of a successful down-market retailer whose performance suffered badly in the 1980s as its competitors revitalised themselves. Attempts to shift towards more fashionable goods came painfully slowly in the face of a set of unspoken beliefs and behaviours which assumed a low-cost, high-volume buying approach, including Far East sourcing. Shops had always been seen within the company as places to dispose of the merchandise which had been bought: there was little comprehension of marketing. Outsiders who had been brought in to create such changes did not last very long. Market research reports were re-interpreted to make sense in terms of what Johnson calls the 'taken-for-granted' assumptions of how to trade. Even when managers recognised intellectually the cultural constraints under which they were labouring, a set of factors hampered significant change, and even questioning of the status quo. These included political and ritualistic behaviour, controls on costs, the hierarchical nature of the organisation, managerial in-breeding, and all sorts of other links with the past. The early attempts by the company to be 'more fashionable' took the form of trying to copy fashionable merchandise from UK boutiques, have it cheapened in the Far East, and distributed through low-cost distribution channels. 'It was a merchandise and buying-driven response, rather than anything to do with the expectations of customers,' says Johnson. 'Nor did it address the ambience of stores, the service of staff, the behaviour of managers in head office, nor the fundamental quality of the product range.' The company began to change, but was acquired by a bigger stores group. When Johnson's 'cultural web' mapping technique was then applied, the senior executives revealed that one of the biggest blockages of all was themselves, and various 'routines' that they used. These included their lack of readiness to challenge each other and their emphasis on pragmatic, rather than analytical, decisions. Despite this revelation, and the subsequent departure of several top executives, the company has never quite made the strategic breakthrough which it might have done, says Johnson. It has continued to stumble up against its remaining cultural hurdles. *Strategy, Culture and Managerial Action. LRP Feb 1992.</p>

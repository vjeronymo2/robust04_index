			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> REQUEST FOR STUDY OF SCHOOL SITE REJECTED  </P> <P> The board of the Oxnard Elementary School District voted unanimously Wednesday  night against seeking an environmental impact report for a proposed  intermediate school in the La Colonia neighborhood, moving a step closer to  construction of the $16-million school.  </P> <P> The vote came despite objections from Marc L. Charney, an attorney who  represents the company that owns the 25-acre proposed site.  </P> <P> Charney told the board that an initial study of the proposed Robert J. Frank  Intermediate School indicated that a full environmental report was needed.  </P> <P> Charney, who represents the F.M. Daily Oxnard Ranch Co., said the district  should seek the report to determine what increase in noise, pollution and  traffic the 1,200-student school would bring to the area, proposed for Juanita  Avenue near North Alley.  </P> <P> Charney said the school would add 1,165 cars a day to Old Colonia Road and  Juanita Avenue, both two-lane streets leading to the proposed site.  </P> <P> Board members, however, said the initial study was sufficient and addresses the  school's potential impact on the neighborhood. The school is scheduled to open  by September, 1993.  </P> <P> Supt. Norman Brekke said district officials have been working for three years  to build the badly needed school, but construction has been delayed because of  disputes over its location and the cost of the land.  </P> <P> Land-value estimates have ranged from $70,000 an acre by a district-hired  appraiser to $250,000 an acre by the owners, Brekke said.  </P> <P> The district would have to condemn the land to acquire it.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, May 31, SPA -- Custodian of the two holy  mosques, King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz has sent a message to  president Husni Mubarak of Egypt.    The message was handed over by Prince Saud al-Faysal, the  foreign minister who was received by President Mubarak here on  Tuesday.    Following the meeting, Prince Saud said the message dealt  with the constant coordination and consultation between the two  leaders. He termed the meeting as a good opportunity to  congratulate President Mubarak on the early success of the  conference of the Non-Aligned Movement which was started in  Cairo earlier in the day and highlighted the inaugural speech  delivered by President Mubarak before the opening session.    Asked on whether he discussed the Yemen crisis with the  President Prince Saud said both King Fahd and President Mubarak  have shown much concern on the painful fighting between the  Yemeni brothers and they urged the conflicting parties to stop  fighting with the hope that all concerned parties would respond  to the appeal.    Prince Saud expressed hope that the U.N. Security Council  would adopt an effective resolution for ceasefire in Yemen and  added that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia would support any measure  that would lead to ceasefire and end of the war.    Meanwhile, Prince Saud told reporters following the opening  session of the conference of foreign ministers of non-aligned  countries of the great importance of the role that should be  undertaken by the Non-Aligned Movement towards the new  international developments.    Referring to criticism that the role of the Movement has  been  diminished and become less effective in international affairs,  Prince Saud cited remarks made by President Mubarak on the  matter in his comprehensive speech at the opening session on the  matter that the role of the Non-Aligned Movement should deal  dynamically with the new international reality and, that the  movement should deal with rational and realistic approachs.    Citing prospects that the Non-Aligned Movement would  concentrate on economic affairs rather than political ones,  prince said the the Group of 77, assigned by the Movement, is  tackling economic issues. He added that a number of proposals on  the role of the movement would be discussed in a special session.    Prince Saud expressed support for enlargement of the role of  the Movement in the United Nations on international peace and  security both in the Security Council and the General Assembly  to ensure fair handling of international issues.    "The problem is not on whether to increase the represenation  of the Non-Aligned Movement in the Security Council, but matters  concerning the identification of the Security Council and how it  should deals with its duties should also be raised." he said.</p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> BUSH AGAIN: Last April, President Bush spoke at a former drug dealers'  confiscated hideaway (B5) in Orange County -- a coup for Sheriff Brad Gates. .  . . Now, Bush may be coming to talk about drugs again, with Gates again a  factor. . . . Bush's trip will be paid for by the Drug Use Is Life Abuse  foundation -- a Gates project and spinoff of his Citizens Advisory Council. . .  . For this visit, which could come in a couple of weeks, presidential advance  men have checked out several Santa Ana-area schools. Dana Parsons  </P></p>

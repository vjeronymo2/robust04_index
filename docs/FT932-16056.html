			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE LACK of strong economic or political features to inspire traders saw the futures contract fall through what many had considered its resistance level, writes Joel Kibazo. Trading in the June contract on the FT-SE 100 followed the familiar path traced over the past few sessions. It opened at 2,854, and it had risen to 2,868 by mid-morning, which turned out to be the high of the day. But with the early shoppers soon satisfied, the contract found few other takers and drifted lower thereafter, falling through the 2,855 mark, a level which many market traders had considered to be a support point for the June contract. The afternoon only brought a further decline and the early weakness on Wall Street saw June fall to the day's low of 2,836. Bargain hunters finally took the opportunity of buying at the lower levels, which lifted June out of the doldrums, helping it to a close of 2,845, a decline of 10 from the previous session but around 4 points above fair value premium to cash of about 11. Turnover dropped to 5,828 contracts. However, the volume in the traded options showed a substantial improvement from Monday's poor figure, reaching 29,191 lots by the official close. Some 9,298 contracts were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option, while dealings in Hillsdown totalled 2,841, making it the most active of the stock options.</p>

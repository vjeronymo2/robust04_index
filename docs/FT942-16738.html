			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Invalid looks set to make recovery: Alice Rawsthorn looks at the French banking sector in the wake of the rescue deal for Credit Lyonnais For the past few weeks, the French banking industry has been dominated by the political rows over the government's FFr44.9bn (Pounds 5.25bn) rescue deal for Credit Lyonnais. But behind the scenes, France's other big banks have quietly been healing their wounds after two bruising years of recession. Suez, the holding company with extensive banking interests, earlier this week confirmed that it came back into the black last year. Paribas, Societe Generale and Credit Commercial de France recently announced increased profits for 1993. Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) was the only one of the large banking groups to suffer a fall in profits last year. French banking is still in a fragile state, as illustrated last week by the government's announcement that it was postponing the privatisation of Banque Hervet, a small commercial bank, until it had completed a FFr750m recapitalisation plan. But the economy is now creeping out of recession and, judging by the cautiously confident tone of recent results announcements, the banking industry is on course for recovery. 'France has just had its worst recession since the war and all the banks have suffered,' said Mr Sasha Serafimovski, banking analyst at Merrill Lynch. 'But 1994 will be a much easier year for the industry and we should see the start of a recovery.' One of the main problems for France's banks during the early 1990s has been the decline in demand for credit, reflecting the impact of high real interest rates and the low level of confidence among companies and consumers. The credit squeeze, which followed a buoyant era of double digit growth in credit during the late 1980s, has imposed intense pressure on margins by forcing the banks to fight for share in a shrinking market. Their only consolation last year was a windfall profit from their market trading activities during the summer's currency crisis, which compensated for their poor returns from retail banking. In theory the level of credit demand should increase when the economy picks up. But in practice there is usually a time-lag while confidence recovers. The French banks also face the problem of a highly liquid corporate sector, which means that companies will wait until they have exhausted their existing capital before borrowing again. There is, however, some hope of an improvement in credit demand this year. Meanwhile the banks hope to accentuate the beneficial effect of improved market conditions through increased productivity. French banks have high overheads by international standards. Ms Sheila Garrard, banking analyst at Lehman Brothers, estimates that operating costs account for 67 per cent to 68 per cent of the net income of both BNP and Societe Generale against 65 per cent for comparable banks in the UK and Switzerland, or 60 per cent in Spain. So far the banks have been hampered in their cost-cutting efforts by strict French labour laws and tough trade unions. However Credit Lyonnais last month unveiled a dramatic plan to reduce its 38,449-strong French workforce by 10 per cent over the next three years as part of its rescue effort. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman of Credit Lyonnais, claims that the group is in such a precarious state that staff have no choice but to accept the cuts. If he succeeds in implementing his rationalisation proposals, other French banks will be in a much stronger position to demand heavier cuts from their own employees. Meanwhile the banks are hopeful that 1994 will herald the end of their difficulties in the property market. Commercial property has been one of the chief casualties of the French recession. A number of banks, such as Credit Lyonnais, Hervet and some Suez subsidiaries, have been forced to make heavy writedowns on property-related loans and investments. However the banks will almost certainly have to make further writedowns on non-performing corporate loans as, traditionally, the rate of business failures has remained high even after the end of a recession as small companies often hit cashflow crises in the struggle to meet increased demand. 'We're certain to see better results for the French banks in 1994, but that's only the start of the story,' said Merrill Lynch's Mr Serafimovski. 'The real recovery will come in 1995 and 1996. The question is how big it will be.'</p>

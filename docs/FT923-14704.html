			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / The Munich Summit: Russia puts respect at the top of its want-list - John Lloyd and Leyla Boulton preview Boris Yeltsin's talks in Munich tomorrow RUSSIA needs money, and needs it badly. But top of the list of what it hopes for from the Munich summit is the non-tangible matter of respect. Russia wants to be seen to be important, indeed central, to the world. 'We don't expect concrete decisions in Munich,' said Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy premier, in an interview yesterday. 'It's a place not for concrete decisions but for the display of political support.' The Russian delegation wants the G7 to demonstrate that making decisions on the world economic process is impossible without Russia, especially in relation to those problems which most worry them, such as economic collapse and debt. At the same time, the success of economic reform in Russia depends on the world economic situation. 'So the point which will be made by the Russian president,' said Mr Shokhin, 'is not that the G7 should become the G8 - but instead it will be an attempt to show that Russia is an equal industrial partner with these countries. Not equal, perhaps, in its economic situation but equal in the sense that it has the potential to help decide on the main questions facing the world.' As proof of the contribution Russia can make, he said it would propose three new sites for oil exploration to be opened to foreign investors. He did not name them, but they seem likely to be new areas rather than existing sites like the offshore reserves at Sakhalin. The 'headline' news of the grant of the first tranche of Dollars 1bn of IMF funds to Russia is not, formally, a matter for the G7 - though Mr Shokhin stressed that the agreement reached between Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director and President Boris Yeltsin, had been concluded under G7 pressure. The agreement goes before the IMF board next month. However, Mr Shokhin 'does not exclude' the possibility that Mr Yeltsin will ask for debt forgiveness for a period of at least two years. He himself would prefer to ask for five years, a figure already mooted by Mr Yegor Gaidar, acting prime minister, in talks last month with Mr Jaques Delors, European Commission president. 'What perhaps we might say is that, if it takes us two and a half years to carry through our reform programme, then we should have debt relief for that period,' he said. Among other issues which Mr Shokhin said were on the Russian agenda are: A programme to convert nuclear power stations of the Chernobyl type to non-nuclear use. Mr Shokhin said this was a matter which had to be discussed both within the framework of overall energy policy - 'since this might, for example, involve us in an increase in gas production' - and as a financial matter, since Russia might expect compensation to be paid if it agreed to shut these reactors down. An end to barriers on trade besetting Russian exporters. Mr Shokhin specifically mentioned quotas on aluminium and uranium, and suggested that compensation might also be demanded for Russia's continued observance of these. In the recent past, Mr Gaidar has asked again for an end to the Cocom rules which restrict the import of certain types of high technology equipment into Russia. The setting up of a permanent co-ordinating centre to deal with foreign assistance to Russia - especially that channeled through the G7 and the European Community. There have been complaints that aid has been haphazard and unco-ordinated. Even on the assumption that some, at least, of this would be forthcoming, Mr Shokhin phlegmatically admitted that the growing ranks of the Russian opposition were unlikely to credit the government with much success. The figure of Dollars 1bn would be seen as too little, and the 'anti-popular' measures taken too harsh. However, he underlined the government's determination not to be seen to kowtow to the IMF. 'We must insist on this: that the programme is ours and the measures taken are those we think are best. The talks with the IMF have been designed to fit our programme to the offer of assistance from the IMF and the foreign governments.' This will not placate the critics. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, speaker of the Russian parliament and a permanent and vocal detractor of the IMF process, said yesterday that the fund's promises of support were 'mere rhetoric'. The G7 governments, he said, had pushed Russia down the path of market reform and 'now it is time for them to foot the bill'. Nothing that the Munich summiteers, constrained by problems at home, can do will foot such an open-ended bill as Mr Khasbulatov has in mind. Mr Yeltsin's domestic struggles are not likely to be eased after his session with his fellow leaders tomorrow. Leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States meeting yesterday in Moscow agreed to create a peacekeeping force modelled on the UN 'blue berets', write John Lloyd and Dmitri Volkov. They are also to establish a 'rouble zone' of countries using the former Soviet currency, now issued by the Russian central bank. No details were given, except that the zone is designed to protect its members from the effects of the introduction of separate currencies by those states refusing to stay in the zone. The new peacekeeping force will be sent first to Moldova to attempt to separate the two warring sides in the conflict between the Moldovan military and the various forces fighting on the side of the self-proclaimed republic of Trans Dnestr. President Boris Yeltsin said CIS ministers would meet soon to work out the mechanisms for the force.</p>

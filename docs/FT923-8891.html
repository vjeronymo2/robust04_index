			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: In charted waters If you believe the chartists, the equity market is now teetering on the edge of a black hole. Yesterday the FT-SE flirted with the 2,445 low reached just before Christmas. If this level were breached, chartist theory shows no obvious sign of resistance until 2,150, from where prices rallied during the Gulf war. With present low volumes, the market might just be tempted to try to prove the chartists right. Then again, equities would look ridiculously cheap with the index at 2,150. The yield ratio between equities and gilts would fall to 1.6 times, against 1.75 times at present and a long-term average of around 2. The prospective p/e for the market as a whole would fall from perhaps 13.5 to little over 12.25. Logic suggests that buyers would step in before these levels were reached, though it would help if there were some more encouraging news around. The interim results season has so far produced figures roughly in line with forecasts but a worrying tendency for negative comment on the trading outlook. Yesterday's company insolvency figures show a rate of attrition which, while stable, is still unacceptably high. Sterling remains pinned to the bottom of the ERM grid. The Bundesbank left interest rates unchanged at its latest council meeting but it could still decide on another turn of the monetary screw. Uncertainty ahead of France's Maastricht referendum on September 20 is an almost surplus excuse to do nothing. Shares are marked down in the hope of finding buyers, but none come forward. Still, if that gives the chartists their chance, canny investors will look for bargains.</p>

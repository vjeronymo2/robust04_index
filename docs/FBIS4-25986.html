			<p>BFN     [Text] Taiyuan, June 16 (XINHUA) -- A foreign-funded  agricultural project has brought benefits to some 300,000  farmers living in mountainous areas in north China's Shanxi  Province.    Initiated in 1991, the program is aimed at improving soil,  and building water conservancy and irrigation facilities.    The 314 million yuan (about 36 million U.S. dollars)  involved  comes partly from loans offered by the International Fund for  Agricultural Development.    Now the per-capita income of farmers in the five  poverty-stricken counties has increased by 70 yuan (about eight  U.S. dollars) a year.    Three more foreign-aided projects are under way in the  province, focusing on water and soil preservation. One is  financed by the World Bank, another by the World Food Program,  and the third by Japan.</p>

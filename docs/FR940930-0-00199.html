			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (4) Clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifiers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are subject to the post-installation emissions testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements in paragraph (c) of this section and who will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfy these requirements by using the two speed idle test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure detailed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conduct the following testing at the time of certification in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to generate the required certification CO emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference values. The certification CO emissions reference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> values generated must be submitted to the Administrator at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time of application for certification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) For dual and flexible fuel vehicles, certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference values must be generated for each certification test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel required for exhaust emissions testing pursuant to 40 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 86.113 or 40 CFR 86.1313.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) For light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks the test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuels used during the emissions testing required by paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)(3) of this section must comply with the fuel specifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for exhaust emissions testing found in 40 CFR 86.113. For heavy-duty engines the test fuels used during the emissions testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by paragraph (b)(3) of this section must comply with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel specifications for exhaust emissions testing found in 40 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 86.1313.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Single, consecutive idle mode and high-speed mode segments of the two speed idle test must be conducted pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the requirements of 40 CFR 85.2215 and as modified by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(D) of this section and this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph to determine the required certification CO emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference values.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The certification CO emission reference value for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> idle mode of the test will be the simple average of all emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measurements taken during an idle mode of 90 seconds duration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to the requirements in 40 CFR 85.2215(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The certification CO emission reference value for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high-speed mode of the test will be the simple average of all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions measurements taken during a high-speed mode of 180  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seconds duration pursuant to the requirements in 40 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 85.2215(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each converted vehicle manufactured by a clean-fuel vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aftermarket conversion certifier with aggregate sales of less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 10,000 converted vehicles within a given calendar year must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfy the post-installation emissions testing requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (c)(2) of this section. If a vehicle fails to satisfy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the emissions testing requirements such vehicle may not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered a clean- fuel vehicle until such noncompliance is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rectified and compliance is demonstrated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with estimated sales of 300 or fewer engines and vehicles in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calendar year and which sells or converts vehicles outside of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-attainment area (as classified under subpart D of Title I)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which has an inspection and maintenance program that includes a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test of carbon monoxide emissions may submit a request to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator for an exemption from the post-installation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission test requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> granted, such an exemption would apply to converted vehicles that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have the conversion installation performed outside of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonattainment area which has an inspection and maintenance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program that includes a test of carbon monoxide emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The request for exemption submitted to the Administrator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must include the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The estimated number of engines and vehicles that will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> converted in the calendar year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Sufficient information to demonstrate that complying with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the post-installation emission test requirement represents a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> severe financial hardship.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) A description of any emission related quality control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway's PM seeks tough carbon taxes TOUGH CARBON taxes to protect the environment were called for yesterday by the Norwegian prime minister. 'They may not be popular, but they are necessary,' Mrs Gro Harlem Bruntland told the biennial Offshore Northern Seas oil and gas conference in Stavanger. Carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are responsible for the so-called greenhouse effect, which scientists say causes global warming and threatens the flooding of coastal areas. Norway, which produces more than 2m barrels of oil per day, has responded to this threat by introducing carbon taxes which have made its petrol among the dearest in the world. But other oil producing countries have claimed such taxes only contribute to the state revenues of rich, oil-consuming countries while reducing the earnings of developing countries dependent on oil exports. Environmental legislation was one of the imponderables that Mr David Simon, BP group chief executive and deputy chairman, told the conference were threatening further destabilisation of the oil sector. Others were dissatisfaction within the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries with the current quota system and a desire among those countries to expand downstream operations and to reintegrate production and distribution. The oil industry would be forced to respond to new instability and change in order to restore profitability so as to attract fresh capital from investors, he said. It would have to find ways of absorbing operations costs and expanding profit margins to justify continued investment.</p>

			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Woman in the News: Safe from screams of intolerance - Taslima Nasreen Taslima Nasreen, the controversial Bangladeshi writer, was yesterday about as far away as it is possible to get from the steamy streets of Dhaka where her life was under threat from Moslem fundamentalists. Hidden somewhere in the cool Swedish forests, where she was whisked under police guard after fleeing to Stockholm on a tourist visa earlier this week, Ms Nasreen's hosts from PEN, the writer's association, said she was enjoying the natural tranquillity and security that now surrounds her. The author herself said she may emerge from her secret hideout next week to answer questions about whether she intends to apply for asylum in Sweden, neighbouring Norway, or some other western country, or whether she eventually intends to go home. For the time being, in her only direct statement, she said: 'Even though I find myself in a secure refuge, I need peace and quiet before I am sufficiently recovered to be able to fulfil my public obligations.' Her uncharacteristic reticence since leaving home is a measure of the pressure Ms Nasreen, who is 32, has been under since she was forced into hiding in June by death threats from fundamentalists enraged by her views, particularly on the role of women in Moslem society. Ms Nasreen has been challenging Islam since she was 10 years old. She remembers her parents letting her two brothers go outside to play, while she was told to stay at home. When she argued, her parents said: 'You are a girl. A girl has no right to go outside the house.' It was, she recalls, her first experience of the discrimination between men and women which has since come to dominate her life. She rebelled against that discrimination with a fury which eventually led thousands of fundamentalists to take to the streets of Dhaka. The storm she provoked has left many Bangladeshis uneasy about their country, which has long considered itself to be among the most tolerant of Moslem-dominated states. For the rest of the world, Ms Nasreen's experience comes as an uncomfortable reminder of the Salman Rushdie affair. Now there are two writers whose pursuit of literary freedom has forced them to go into hiding. In each case, Islamic mullahs have questioned the primacy given in the west to freedom of speech and self-expression. They say such freedoms should not extend to the freedom to insult God. This clash has certainly been in evidence in Sweden this week. Mr Mahmoud Aldebe, head of the Swedish Islamic Council, asked pointedly: 'Why are only those who criticise Islam invited to Sweden, and not those who defend Islam?' Swedish government officials, mindful that many of the country's 350,000-strong non-European immigrant community are Moslems, say they are sensitive to Islamic values. 'But in the end the overriding issue is the desire to defend basic values of free speech and expression. That is why Taslima Nasreen was warmly welcomed here,' said a foreign ministry official. Ms Nasreen comes from a middle-class family in which she was encouraged to study. She followed her father in becoming a doctor. But she defied her parents' efforts to control her behaviour, for example, by talking to boys. She married and divorced twice. Both husbands, she says, reneged on promises to respect her freedom. Both wanted their food cooked, their shirts washed, and their bodies massaged, she says. She stopped practising medicine because, she says, she could no longer stand the screams of women giving birth to girls. It was a brutal reminder of the over-whelming importance placed in Bangladesh on the value of boys over girls. At the same time, Ms Nasreen became increasingly involved in her writing, producing magazine articles, pamphlets and books - all aimed at promoting equality for women. She attacked Islam but only because, as she once said, 'Islam gives women no freedom.' Her critics say she exaggerates the condition of Bangladeshi women. They argue that the country has a woman prime minister and a woman leader of the opposition. There are women doctors, lawyers and pilots. Women are the main beneficiaries of the country's largest charity, the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee. Indeed much of the SKr250m (Pounds 20m) grant aid Sweden gives to Bangladesh every year is directed specifically towards women. But this has not blunted Ms Nasreen's criticisms. The real issue, she believes, is the abuse of women. Girl babies are left to die while no care is spared to bring up boys. The statistics suggest that Ms Nasreen has a point. For example, according to United Nations data, the literacy rate in Bangladesh for men is 47 per cent and for women only 22 per cent. This gap is common in the developing world but it is particularly wide in Moslem countries. Initially, Ms Nasreen's efforts to highlight this anomaly in her writing attracted little attention outside the literary circles of middle-class Dhaka. But in the early 1990s, Jamaat-e-Islami, the leading fundamentalist political party, singled out Ms Nasreen for attack. It whipped up a storm when she published Shame - a fictional account of how Moslems tortured a Bangladeshi Hindu family after the sacking of the Ayodhya mosque in India in 1992. Shame was banned in Bangladesh on the grounds that it might foment Hindu-Moslem violence. But it became a best-seller in India, where it was translated into English. Suddenly, Ms Nasreen had become too important for the fundamentalists to ignore. There were repeated death threats and the government supplied a police guard. Ms Nasreen continued to court controversy. In May she gave an interview to an Indian newspaper in which she was quoted as saying the Koran needed revising. She later claimed she was misquoted but it was too late. Mrs Khaleda Zia, the prime minister, authorised Ms Nasreen's prosecution on a charge of promoting religious unrest. Ms Nasreen went into hiding for a month, emerged in public to appear in court, and fled Bangladesh, apparently with the tacit co-operation of government officials. Many middle-class Bangladeshis believe Ms Nasreen has stupidly given fundamentalists a rallying cry in a country where they command little power. But now there is a risk that to appease the fundamentalists, the government may be forced to enact tough anti-blasphemy laws, including a death penalty. Such laws would run counter to the Bengali tradition of tolerance, which dates back to the 19th century when Calcutta became the capital of British India and a melting pot of people and ideas, including atheism and feminism. Bangladeshis believe that even though Calcutta was lost to India, this tradition still thrives in their country. However, fundamentalists in Bangladesh draw much of their support from poor and ignorant villagers - people who have hardly been touched by Calcuttan tolerance.</p>

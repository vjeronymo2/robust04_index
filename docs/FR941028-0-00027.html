			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSM has also renumbered certain provisions of the regulation at 30 CFR 773.20(c). Among such provisions, renumbered paragraph (c)(1)(iv), which authorizes the regulatory authority to use rescission as one of the remedial measures for improvident permit issuance, deletes a specific reference contained in the former 30 CFR 773.20(c)(4) to the rescission procedures of 30 CFR 773.21. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reason for this deletion is that OSM today establishes a prior notice and a common appeal procedure for both permit suspensions and permit rescissions with respect to improvidently issued permits. The former regulation governing permit suspensions at 30 CFR 773.20(c)(3) did not impose any specific requirements for prior notice, opportunity to be heard, or right of appeal for the permittee whose permit is to be suspended. See 54 FR 18450 (1989). In contrast to this, regulations governing permit rescissions at 30 CFR 773.21 contained specific requirements for prior notice to a permittee and an explicit right of appeal. OSM has now provided for greater consistency in its procedures governing suspension and rescission of permits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, OSM amends 30 CFR 773.20 to add a new paragraph (c)(2) which requires that a regulatory authority which decides to suspend a permit must provide at least 30 days' prior written notice to the permittee. In the event that the regulatory authority decides to rescind a permit, it must provide notice in accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 773.21. The amendment further provides that a permittee be given the opportunity to request administrative review of the notice under Office of Hearings and Appeals, (OHA) rule 43 CFR 4.1370  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , where OSM is the regulatory authority, or under the State program equivalent, where the State is the regulatory authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulation further allows for enhanced due process protection and fairness by providing that temporary relief from the regulatory authority's decision is available in accordance with the provisions of OHA rule 43 CFR 4.1376 or the State program equivalent. In the absence of such temporary relief, the regulatory authority's decision remains in effect during the pendency of appeal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM has retained the language in paragraph 773.20 which addresses the situation which occurs when a permit is issued in reliance upon the presumption that an NOV is being abated in the absence of a cessation order and a cessation order is, in fact, issued with respect to the violation. In such an event, a regulatory authority is required to find that the permit has been improvidently issued. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM amends paragraph (a) of 30 CFR 773.21 to make the provisions of &sect;773.25, standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status of violations, applicable when a regulatory authority invokes the automatic suspension and rescission procedures of 30 CFR 773.21. The rationale for such amendment is the same as that discussed above with respect to similar language contained in &sect;773.20. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, OSM deletes former paragraph (c) of 30 CFR 773.21 which provides for appeals of rescission notices. As discussed above, rescission appeal procedures are incorporated in 30 CFR 773.20. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 773.22 is a new section and mandates an inquiry whose focus is to assure that the regulatory authority develops complete and accurate information as to the identification of the applicant and all owners or controllers of the applicant prior to making a determination on a permit application and enters such information promptly into the AVS. Accordingly, this section focuses on verification of ownership or control application information. Such accurate and complete information enables the regulatory authority to make an informed decision as to whether the applicant is linked to a surface coal mining and reclamation operation in violation of the Act or other any other environmental law within the terms of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

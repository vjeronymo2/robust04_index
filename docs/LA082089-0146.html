			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> MOBIL ASKED TO HOLD REFINERY OPEN HOUSE SOMEPLACE ELSE  </P> <P> The city of Torrance has decided to play party pooper for open house  festivities Mobil Oil Corp. hoped would draw 12,000 people to its refinery on  Oct. 7.  </P> <P> The oil company -- which is being sued by Torrance over hazards at the refinery  -- was planning to spend up to $200,000 for jugglers, clowns, hot dogs,  hamburgers, a Ferris wheel, a carousel, informational booths and bus tours of  the refinery.  </P> <P> But in a letter released Friday, the city expressed concern about safety at the  plant and suggested that Mobil hold its "public relations" event at a large  city park. City officials in interviews Friday stopped short of saying they  would flatly ban the party or refuse to issue permits for it.  </P> <P> Mobil officials responded to the city in a short, sharp press release late  Friday. Noting that the city reacted after only brief talks with refinery  officials, Mobil said "the city's letter amounts to a blanket rejection of our  plans without any consideration of what they might be."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Constitutional Rights Cited  </P> <P> Mobil declared: "Our plant is safe." It said the city's "unlawful and unfair"  action would deny the company "its constitutional rights of assembly, free  speech, equal protection and due process of law."  </P> <P> Spokesman Barry Engelberg said company officials had received the city's letter  Friday and had not decided whether to go ahead with plans for the open house or  whether Mobil would try to force the city to issue permits for the festivities.  </P> <P> The city and Mobil already are embroiled in legal and political disputes on  several fronts. In April, the city sued Mobil, seeking to have the refinery  declared a public nuisance subject to city regulation. The oil company  countersued, saying the refinery is safe.  </P> <P> In July and August, the city also filed criminal misdemeanor charges against  Mobil, several of its officials and subcontractors as a result of accidents  that happened in the summer of 1988.  </P> <P> And in March, 1990, Torrance voters will decide a ballot initiative that would  effectively eliminate the use of acutely hazardous hydrofluoric acid at the  plant. Mobil officials estimate that the measure would cost the refinery from  $50 million to $100 million.  </P> <P> The existing disputes played a role in each sides' actions.  </P> <P> City Atty. Ken Nelson said Friday that the city's lawsuit might be harmed if  the permits for the open house were issued, because the action could be  interpreted as indicating that the city considers the refinery safe.  </P> <P> Because the city has limited grounds on which to refuse some permits, such as  those needed for erecting a tent or stringing electric lights for  entertainment, Nelson said Mobil might be able to force their issuance in  court.  </P> <P> "We would just as soon not fight over the fact," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Might Seek Stipulation  </P> <P> If pressed, Nelson said, Torrance might seek a stipulation from Mobil that  approval of the permits in no way addresses the safety issues at the core of  the lawsuit.  </P> <P> And Mobil, which has said previously that the reason for the party is to polish  the refinery's image, accused the city of being hypocritical.  </P> <P> The Mobil statement noted that the city has "criticized Mobil for being  non-communicative with its neighbors," but now that there is "a real  opportunity . . . to have an informal exchange of ideas with its neighbors, the  city has said 'NO.' "  </P> <P> "Our proposal to stage an open house at our facility creates no risk to our  neighbors who would attend," the statement said.  </P> <P> City officials said they learned of the Mobil open house proposal in a July 25  letter from Mobil seeking city assistance for crowd and traffic control.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Letter to Refinery Manager  </P> <P> The city's response came in a letter dated Wednesday, from Assistant City  Manager Albert Ng to Refinery Manager Wyman Robb.  </P> <P> In it, Ng wrote: "It is understandable that Mobil Oil would want to have an  event such as this, and it makes sense that the positive public relations would  be important to the corporation at this time.  </P> <P> "However, it is the feeling of the city of Torrance that it is inappropriate to  have such a large public assembly at the refinery in light of the safety  concerns which have been expressed over the past several years. Furthermore, it  seems particularly unwise for the city to issue permits for the planned  activity based on these concerns."  </P></p>

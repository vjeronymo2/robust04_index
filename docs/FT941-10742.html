			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Slovenia offers role model for Ukraine's links with Russia Sir, In your editorial, 'Europe's next flashpoint' (February 3), you suggest the relationship between Germany and Austria as a model for the future relationship between Russia and Ukraine. The analogy escapes me. These two countries are totally independent from each other, linked now only by the schilling being tied to the D-Mark. We should be able to do better than that. A better analogy for future Russian-Ukrainian relations is the Austrian-Slovenian relationship. For most of its history, Slovenia was a small and prosperous part of Austria. Now it is independent, and the two peoples can cross back and forth across their border without a passport - feeling perfectly at home in either land. Slovenia is a democratic, prosperous and progressive country. Its economy is thriving. The two countries are closely linked, on a basis of mutual respect. If Ukraine can evolve in the same direction vis a vis Russia, it will be doing very well indeed. Henry Owen, 1616 H Street, NW, Washington DC 20006, US</p>

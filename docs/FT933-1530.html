			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Interest cut lifts Barratt to Pounds 20m - Continuing recovery underlined with 81% rise and increased final BARRATT Developments, Britain's third largest housebuilder, underlined its continued recovery yesterday by posting an 81 per cent increase in full year pre-tax profits and increasing its final dividend. Pre-tax profits in the year ended June 30 jumped to Pounds 20.4m (Pounds 11.3m) on turnover which fell by 7.5 per cent to Pounds 405.3m (Pounds 438.3m). The profit improvement mainly reflected a sharp reduction in interest costs which dropped to Pounds 7.3m (Pounds 15.9m) as the group's net debt fell to Pounds 34m at the end of June from Pounds 57.1m a year earlier. Earnings per share rose to 9.3p (7.8p) and the group is paying a final dividend of 3p (2p) which makes a total of 4p for the year - double the previous year when there was no interim payment. The improved profits and dividend helped push Barratt's shares higher yesterday to close 15p higher at 187p. Operating profits fell slightly to Pounds 27.3m (Pounds 28.5m), but the decline was more than offset by a Pounds 400,000 share of profits from associated undertakings, compared to a Pounds 1.3m loss previously. The group sold 4,988 homes during the year - up from 4,706 - in addition to which, the construction subsidiary completed another 314 housing association homes. The average selling price fell to Pounds 74,800 (Pounds 79,900) with the decline mainly reflecting changes in the product mix as Barratt built more smaller first-time buyer properties. Sir Lawrie Barratt, who came out of retirement to rescue Barratt two years ago, said the group had made sound progress working its way through its historic land stocks, the majority of which could only be developed in the upper price ranges and which yielded very low margins or incurred losses. As part of a three-year growth plan to rebuild UK housing volume, Barratt plans to sell 5,700 houses this year rising to 8,000 in 1995-96. The group's US subsidiary, which builds homes in southern California and accounts for about 8 per cent of group turnover, reported an unchanged trading loss of Pounds 700,000 last year, although Mr Frank Eaton, chief executive, said he hoped the business would make a small contribution to profits this year. He said that Barratt planned to reduce its investment in the recession-hit California market by accelerating completions to about 500 this year and reducing the US land bank. COMMENT With Sir Lawrie back in the driving seat, Barratt's recovery has been underpinned by a reduction in total debt from Pounds 205m in June 91 to Pounds 43m at the end of June this year - equivalent to gearing of 22 per cent. Now that the UK housing market ismoving in the right direction, Barratt should be able to boost volumes and margins this year. Pre-tax profits should reach Pounds 32m, equivalent to 12.8p of earnings. With a prospective p/e of 14.6 the shares are undervalued relative to other housebuilders and despite yesterday's gains are still a good recovery buy.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Devil is in the dealmaking The rule is well-known. It never changes. Make a deal with the forces of darkness and you pay with your soul. Mr John Major entered into such an agreement last September. In a celebrated article in The Economist, he sealed a bargain with the nationalists and little Englanders who have since held sway in his Conservative coalition. Its import was clear. The ratification of the Maastricht treaty, which he had forced through parliament by risking his government's life on a single no-confidence vote, was an experience not to be repeated. Britain would remain within the European Union, but would seek to remould it as a Gaullist congeries of nation states. In return the prime minister would be granted a respite from internecine strife. The arrangement must have sounded harmless at the time. After all, the EU, like the EC before it, always has been a permanent conference of independent governments, perpetually negotiating with one another. In essence, it still is. The language of Mr Major's carefully-constructed concordat was ostensibly designed to unite the Tories. Drafts were shown to influential individuals, left and right, Eurosceptic and Europhobe. 'I want to see the community become a wide union,' he wrote, 'embracing the whole of democratic Europe, in a single market and with common security arrangements firmly linked to Nato.' That sounded noble enough, but there was a pay-off. The community he wanted would cease to 'nibble at national freedoms'. There would be no further encroachments on British sovereignty. Maastricht, it was implied, was the last treaty he would ask his party to swallow. It seemed like a fair bargain at the time. In retrospect, it was lethal. Three years after he had presented himself as the prime minister who would put Britain at the heart of Europe, Mr Major had placed his government in thrall to activists who will not rest until the European Union is remade in the image of the soon-to-be-defunct European Free Trade Association. That is why an argument over whether Britain shall be able to block future business in the council of ministers by mustering 23 votes or 27 has become a touchstone of his intentions. It is little wonder that on Tuesday, when his impotence was revealed, the prime minister stood up in the house of commons and snarled like a cornered mouse. The leader of the opposition, said Mr Major, consulting his notes, was the man who liked to say yes - 'monsieur Oui, the poodle of Brussels'. This chauvinists' cliche was intended to constitute an attack on a socialist Europe. It came out as an assault on the institutions of the European Union. The prime minister was on better form yesterday. He spoke reasonably, and managed to focus on socialism. Who knows how he will play, or to which audience, next week? Nothing about this affair has proceeded smoothly. The foreign secretary, searching anxiously for allies in the cabinet, has looked increasingly unhappy as he speaks the language of diplomacy while Mr Major, constantly nudged and jostled by his new-found Euro-sceptic allies, has closed off one option after another. Changing prime ministers would not help. No politician of stature, on either side of the House, has come out fighting for a European perspective. The Liberal Democrats have gone quiet. Labour has enjoyed witnessing the government's discomfiture, but it has offered nothing, not a syllable, in the way of letting us know what it would do in the same situation. Two aspirants for Mr Major's job, Mr Michael Heseltine and Mr Kenneth Clarke, have compromised their known pro-European principles by humming Eurosceptical tunes. That eternal weathervane, Mr David Howell, has written learned articles defending the existing size of the blocking minority. The Conservative chairman of the House of Commons select committee on foreign affairs argues that what is at stake is 'yet more integrationist acceleration'. Unless the rules are changed, he correctly points out, groups of countries with up to 40 per cent of the union's population could be outvoted. Yes, but the best time to change the rules is at the next inter-governmental conference, due in 1996. Against that stands Mr Major's argument that it is his job to protect British interests. Quite so. To 'stand up for Britain' is not in itself anti-European. The prime minister repeated yesterday that the government strongly favours enlargement of the EU. Agreed. Where his case falls down is in the evident motivation behind his stance. It is unmistakably political, designed to save the Conservative party by appealing to patriotism. The ploy will be tested at this week-end's conference of party workers, and again in the series of by-elections, local contests and Euro-polls due between now and June. Those of us who recall Mr Major's successful soapbox defence of the United Kingdom against Scottish separatism in April 1992 would be prudent to suspend judgment on the domestic political effect of this week's events. It has to be said, however, that the omens are discouraging. Middle-of-the-road backbench Tory MPs who would normally not allow the number of blocking votes in the EU to enter their heads have been expressing support for the Eurosceptic position this week. Their single desire is a unified party, under whichever wing can keep the peace. Their concern is for their own seats at the next general election. Some of them are very nervous indeed. Tales abound of constituency parties that have run out of money, selection committees that cannot be bothered to field candidates in the local elections, usually well-attended annual meetings that have been abandoned for lack of an audience, and simple disillusion and demoralisation of the rank and file. These clouds might be at least temporarily dispelled if there is a ' British triumph' on the voting mechanism. What is required is a stitch-up that, at least in appearance, maintains the 23-vote blocking minority on issues, such as social legislation, that Britain considers important. Such an understanding might be negotiated by Mr Douglas Hurd when he meets his fellow foreign ministers in Ioannina, in western Greece, this weekend, or at another venue later on. That would give the prime minister and the Conservative government a breathing space, with no guarantees as to its duration.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Klaus Haensch, SPD top candidate for the </F> European Parliament elections, by Karl-Otto Sattler in  Strasbourg; date not given: "Influencing Politics"]    [Text] The Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]  wants resolutely to oppose nationalist groups in the European  election campaign. On the other hand, it wants to preserve the  consensus of the large democratic parties concerning European  unity. In the opinion of Klaus Haensch (55), it is detrimental  for Europe to list prominent candidates for the balloting on 12  June only because of their names--the SPD is supported by tested  parliamentarians. In 1989 the SPD received 37.3 percent of the  votes. Karl-Otto Sattler interviewed in Strasbourg the SPD's top  candidate for the European elections and the deputy chairman of  the strongest caucus, with its 199 deputies.    [Sattler] Germany is facing a super election year in 1994.  Won't the European elections be drowned out? You even have to  share 12 June with a lot of municipal elections.    [Haensch] It is nothing new or unique to the European  elections that several elections will take place on one day.  That has often been the case in the past. In North  Rhine-Westphalia this time the municipal elections coincide with  the Bundestag elections. In a super election year like this one,  every election stands in the shadow of the others.    [Sattler] Many people feel that nothing is at stake in the  European elections and that they can therefore safely give their  vote to smaller parties, even right-wing parties. The SPD could  hardly benefit from displeasure with the Union.    [Haensch] People who think this way are simply mistaken.  First, the results of the European elections will have a direct  influence on the policies of the European Union [EU]. Since  Maastricht, the Parliament has had actual shared responsibility  for the legislation of the EU and for the establishment of the  Brussels Commission. Which majorities are elected to the  European Parliament will therefore be important. I think the  people will take this into consideration.    [Sattler] At the last SPD election party congress, Gerhard  Schmid, chairman of the German SPD Eurodeputies, wasn't even  elected to the Executive Committee. No prominent person from the  front ranks of the SPD is campaigning in the 12 June elections.  Apparently the European Parliament does not enjoy a great deal  of importance among the SPD.    [Haensch] That is a false conclusion. The SPD has put those  politicians on the list who have performed reliable and  recognized service in the Parliament. To place prominent  politicians on the list who bring nothing but their prominent  names would perform a disservice to Europe. The voters would not  take this seriously.    [Sattler] What are the important issues in the SPD campaign?    [Haensch] The most important point is that the EU has to  help  combat the massive unemployment in Europe. This involves  increased efforts to reestablish the competitiveness of the  entire European industry in world markets. Next, during a period  of limitless destruction of the environment, policy must know no  limits in protecting the environment. It is no longer possible  to have an effective environmental policy confined to national  boundaries. Moreover, in a time when international crime is  organizing, we need an international organization to fight  crime. We Social Democrats want to strengthen Europol as a  European police with real authority. Finally, we Social  Democrats want to see to it that the EU, as a model of the  voluntary unity of European nations, remains a factor for  stability and safeguarding peace in Europe.    [Sattler] In the past the European election campaigns were  quite dull because there were no controversial issues of note.  Everyone was for Europe in the end. Are things going to be  different? Will there be fundamental struggles for Europe? Green  Europoliticians complained about Maastricht, likewise Manfred  Brunner. Edmund Stoiber has reservations toward Europe. Not to  mention the nationalist Republikaner.    [Haensch] For decades in the Federal Republic there was the  basic agreement among the large democratic parties that they  should work for European unity. And in the European election  campaign, I will not set the whole house on fire just to cook an  election campaign soup. The election debates will make it clear  that there are parties and groups that want to return to a  Europe of nationalism, racism, and instabiltiy. We will oppose  these groups.    [Sattler] Maastricht expanded the responsibilities of the  European Parliament. Nevertheless, this body is still quite  powerless. Have you ever had a real feeling of success as a  European deputy?    [Haensch] I wouldn't be here if I hadn't. There are a great  number of such successes. For example, with Maastricht we were  successful in providing a political dimension to European unity,  at least in the initial stage. Another example: Maastricht  strengthened the rights of the Parliament. In the past in a  series of legislative processes, we were able to carry the  position of the Parliament even though there was no legal  obligation. This was the case, for example, with the first  Europeanwide exhaust gas regulation for cars, or with various  environmental guidelines, such as safeguarding drinking water.  In this case, the Social Democratic caucus was able to carry its  position. And, finally, it is a fundamental accomplishment to  ultimately find a common denominator for the various European  national interests--even if only after difficult negotiations in  many cases.</p>

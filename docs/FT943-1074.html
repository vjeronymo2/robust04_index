			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / International Company News: Coca-Cola in South African bottling deal Coca-Cola is to buy control of a bottling venture in South Africa in partnership with a group of black South African investors, writes Mark Suzman in Johannesburg. Under the deal, the value of which has not been disclosed, Coca-Cola has established a joint venture with the Kunene family, long-time Coke distributors in the black townships east of Johannesburg, to purchase control of Vinto Minerals, one of seven major Coca-Cola bottling plants countrywide. It has annual turnover of about R50m (Dollars 14m). Coca-Cola and the Kunenes will each take 50 per cent of a new investment company, Fortune Investment Holdings, which will purchase Vinto. The Kunenes will take over management of Vinto. Coca-Cola withdrew from investment in South Africa in 1986 and announced its formal return to the country last June when it repurchased Natbev, the country's biggest Coke bottler and distributor. The company's products dominate the South African soft drink business, with over 77 per cent of the domestic market.</p>

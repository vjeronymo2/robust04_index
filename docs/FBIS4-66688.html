			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Raghid al-Sulh, a Lebanese political writer and </F> scholar: "The Arab League's Three No's"]    [Text] In the Arab region and some international forums,  there is a lively debate about the future of the regional order  in the area, including the Middle East and North Africa. The  debate is in progress, for the most part, between three groups:    The "Arabism" group is seeking the preservation of the Arab  order and action to bring it out of its current conditions and  develop it, enabling it to withstand international, regional,  and local threats. This group shows a special interest in the  Arab League, seeing it as the eventual embodiment of the concept  of an Arab regional system. It is the parent organization of all  the Arab joint action bodies. This group is thus opposed to the  "Middle East market," in which it sees an attempt to create a  regional framework for Israeli domination of the area.    The "Middle Eastern" group calls for the replacement of the  Arab regional system with another, Middle Eastern one, including  both Arabs and Israelis, at first, and perhaps Turks and  Iranians later on. This group emphasizes the economic benefits  this project would produce and the need for it as a guarantee of  the Arab-Israeli peace.    The last group proposes a third way, between these two  courses. It seeks global and regional arrangements permitting  the Arab system to coexist with the Middle Eastern system and  for the Arab League to exist side by side with Middle Eastern  joint action organizations that may be founded later. This third  group includes some official and unofficial Arab quarters,  chiefly the Secretariat General of the Arab League.    In an effort to propagate this point of view, the  Secretariat  General has prepared a study on the future of joint Arab action  and the Middle East market plan, and distributed it to Arab  ministers of finance, economy, and foreign affairs. The study  showed the great global challenges the Arabs will face in coming  years, especially after the signing of the GATT accord, the  strengthening of regional or continental cooperation between the  countries of the European Union and the North American Free  Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the efforts being made by the seven  large powers to solve the unemployment problem in the  industrialized countries. The study concluded by reaffirming the  importance of regional cooperation in its Arab and Middle  Eastern portions.    In addition, in the course of testifying to the integrity of  the third group's point of view, the secretary general, Dr.  'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, has made statements dealing with the  question of the Middle East market, in which he set forth the  major ideas advanced by proponents of the idea of an  Arab-"Middle Eastern" intermarriage, confirming the practicality  of their plan and its rightness. 'Abd-al-Majid's point of view  here can be summarized in the three following Arab "no's":     -  No privileges given to Israel after the settlement, nor  any Israeli control in the context of the Middle East plan,  because "it is no more than a tiny dot in the world, with  limited resources and surrounded by an Arab world that has great  possibilities," and "the Arabs are not naive; they will not  accept terms imposed upon them or for Israel to have special  status in this market."    -  No fear of a Middle East market on the part of the Arab  order.  "The future belongs to the Arab League because it is the  expression of the sole Arab identity and the image of the  community united by a single culture of values and traditions,  by a single geographic expanse and shared history."    -  "No force or coercion in dealing with Israel." The Arab  countries are sovereign entities and alone will define the way  in which they will deal with the Israelis, according to their  national interests.       The picture drawn by Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid's "no's" should be  welcomed by those keen to preserve the continuation of the Arab  regional order. It strengthens their confidence in the future,  and their hope of developing the maintenance of their resources  and their use in achieving a comprehensive renaissance in the  region. This is the appearance. In substance, however, the  position of the League's secretary general seems to back the  point of view of the "Middle Eastern" group. How and why?    Protecting the regional Arab order from extinction requires  us to define accurately the challenges it will face, and  alerting official and unofficial Arab circles to their existence  and their true extent, and the citizen of their effect on the  Arabs. We must also define the methods by which we may confront  and respond to these challenges, starting with action to unite  the Arabs' forces to achieve this goal and firmly establish the  collective Arab personality and revive the institutions through  which it speaks. The Middle Easterners, by contrast, are seeking  to keep Arab public opinion from fully comprehending these  threats, so that they can ram their plan through without  opposition to speak of, and with as little effort as possible.  In this context, the Middle East market plan is offered as if it  were a plan for coexistence rather than domination. It is, as  one Arab active in politics has described it, a policy of  "impoverish and rule." The positions of the Secretariat General  of the Arab League give encouragement to the Middle Easterners  when they ignore the threats surrounding the Arab world, and  ignore the difference between what they hope for, and what  actually is; between what is the Arabs' natural right, and  actual reality.    Reality says that Israel may lack some raw materials and may  rely on outside aid, as stated in the study the Secretariat  General distributed to Arab officials, but it makes up for this  shortcoming in many ways. It is an industrial country, while  most Arab countries are still agricultural societies. Its  national income is greater than that of most of its neighbors.  Israel is more advanced than the Arabs in the industries of the  future as well as in agriculture. Its needs for water, energy,  raw materials, and investments do not reduce its superiority  over the Arabs; Japan is no less in need of energy resources  than is Israel, and Holland is no less lacking in raw materials;  yet these defects have not hurt these two countries' economies.  It may not be said of Holland that it is an insignificant  country just because it has a small population, nor because its  area is limited, or because it is compelled to import raw  materials from abroad.    What is now proposed is that all doors be thrown open to  bilateral relations between Israel and the countries of the Arab  and Islamic region, to weaken the types of Arab joint action and  collective bilateral Arab action. More bluntly, it is proposed  that Israel and the Western countries deal with Arab countries  on the basis of purely bilateral relations. The "Middle East  market project" is the outward aspect of this reality. It is an  outer facade that conceals an image that puts Israel into the  center of the region and its economic, political, and military  "core area." The Arab countries, on the other hand, become  subject to the center, carrying out its policies and plans. We  sensed this concept of the future at the Madrid conference, when  Israel, and the conference sponsors, rejected the idea of a  unified Arab delegation. Israel took steps, even in the smallest  details, to weaken coordination among the Arab delegations,  staying in scattered places to make cooperation and consultation  among them difficult. These possibilities strengthen Israel's  position economically, politically, and militarily, at the  expense of the Arab countries, and allow it to gain economic  prerogatives, and distinctive political roles, contrary to the  hopes and plans of the League's secretary general.    These projects are not our predestined fate. It is the  Arabs'  right, and it is within their ability, to resist them and to  rebuild their lost unity, to strengthen their national unity,  and to proceed along the path of prosperity; acting, at the same  time, to contain the danger of Israeli expansionism and  hegemonistic ambitions, which Israeli leaders do not even hide.  This course of Arab and international action requires hard and  persistent work with which energetic Arab forces are familiar,  and continual movement to change the regional and international  status quo, which tends to tilt the balance in favor of Israel.  The Secretariat does not ignore this aspect; on the contrary, it  gives it high priority among its concerns, and calls for Arab  reconciliation, the revival of Arab solidarity, and the  reactivation of its institutions. The Secretariat is not calling  for the realization of this goal in a merely formal way; it has  combined the call with practical action, ongoing contacts, and  palpable effort in order to overcome the obstacles in its way.  Therefore the Secretariat has certain knowledge of the extent of  the fragmentation ailing the Arab world, and the policies that  are aimed at turning the fracture that has plagued the Arab body  politic in the 1990's into a permanent state and stable  condition to help in redrawing the identity of the region and  redrawing the map. When the Arabs were in that condition,  comparison among them was as if they were a single power "with  great possibilities" confronting Israel "with limited  resources"--this comparison does not stand on firm ground, and  leads to erroneous conclusions. It spreads feelings of torpor  and apathy in the Arab spirit, when what we need to do is to  give the Arabs incentives to emerge from this condition.    The hope is that the Arabs will be free, as Dr.  'Abd-al-Majid  said, to draw their regional and international policies, and to  choose, without compulsion or coercion, their own way of dealing  with their neighbors, to define their position toward their  enemy purely in accordance with their own interests. The  reality, is however, entirely different. Israel was imposed on  the Arabs by force, and the Arabs lost the Arab lands occupied  in 1967 through war. They were compelled to attend the Madrid  conference under force of threat. The coercion was the outcome  of the pro-Israel Western powers' insistence on guaranteeing  Israel's supremacy over the Arabs, individually and as a group.  Will this policy change if the Arabs accept the Middle Eastern  market?    The great powers, keen to guarantee Israel's superiority in  war and military confrontations, and in support of its role as  policeman of the Middle East, will work on securing its  superiority over the Arabs on the economic scene as well. They  will enable it to obtain broad privileges at the expense of the  Arabs so it can play the role of regional agent for Western  interests. Apart from that, Israel itself will not hesitate to  use its overwhelming military superiority over the Arabs to  obtain economic and political privileges in the region. The  coercion and complusion used against the Arabs today to get them  to end the Arab boycott of Israel, for free, with no reasonable  justification, convinces us of this.    The Arab League's Council, which met in Cairo in September  1993, did not agree to end any of the levels of the Arab boycott  of Israel. This was confirmed by Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid in his  statement in January of this year, when he said that the boycott  would continue "because the reasons for its original imposition  still exist." This position was quickly changed, and the boycott  reviewed by the Arab League itself, even though the reasons for  which it was imposed still existed. Why? Because the U.S.  secretary of commerce asked that the issue be put on the  Council's agenda, and because "the American administration is  determined to end the Arab economic boycott of Israel," as U.S.  Vice President Al Gore told the annual convention of AIPAC  [American-Israel Public Affairs Committee] in Washington. If  this is not compulsion and coercion, then what is? If the change  is not proof and evidence of the distinctive role being prepared  for Israel in the framework of the "Middle East market" plan,  then what proof does the Arab League Secretariat need, to be  convinced that what is needed is to inform Arab public opinion  of the risks of this plan, rather than to minimize it?</p>

			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> READERS HAVE NAME FOR IT: MIKE DOWNEY  </P> <P> Apparently, Mike Downey is so driven to prove himself a pseudo-liberated male  that he found it convenient to ignore the numerous polls conducted on the Lisa  Olson case that found women saying that Olson and her female associates did not  belong in a male locker room. I'm certain, though, that Downey would blame this  finding on centuries of male brainwashing or some other phony reasoning  designed to renew his NOW membership.  </P> <P> JEFF WEINSTOCK  </P> <P> West Hollywood  </P></p>

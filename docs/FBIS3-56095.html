Some Federation  Council Members Advocate Territorial Factions; Others, Party  Factions"]    [Text] Nizhniy Novgorod Governor Boris Nemtsov, elected a  Federation Council deputy, termed as utopian the idea of  dividing the upper chamber into regional factions. "No strong  politician who really represents the interests of local elites  -- like myself, for example -- will have a part in any such  thing," Mr. Nemtsov assured your SEGODNYA correspondent.  According to him, regional leaders, who have but once come up  against the problem of sharing out budget funds, would  "immediately see the extreme danger and ruinous nature of such a  road for the whole of Russia." "We on the contrary are  interested in creating conditions where representatives of the  regional elites could more easily come to terms and establish  links between the regions rather than focus on dividing the  pie," he said.    Besides, Eduard Rossel's promise to bring together everyone  regardless of their "stripes" according to regional interests,  in Boris Nemtsov's phrase, "is almost the same as if I would  want to make Russian National Unity activists my deputies, or to  put representatives of the Communist Party in `top' positions."  For the successful work of the Federation Council it would be  much more interesting, according to him, to see which of the  senators is "red" and which is "white," and "maybe to give that  an organizational form."    Aleksandr Belyayev, chairman of the disbanded St. Petersburg  City Soviet, who has also become a member of the upper chamber,  believes that most probably there will be no official division  in the Federation Council either on a territorial or party  basis. He is convinced that "the entire previous  behind-the-scenes horse-trading is not going to played out at  all on the Federation Council scene."    Interregional associations are being formed even if they are  not given official status, and the interests of various regional  elites will be composed either outside parliament or in its  lobby. Aleksandr Belyayev thinks that understandings reached in  such a "natural way" will only be taken note of in the  Federation Council proper.</p>

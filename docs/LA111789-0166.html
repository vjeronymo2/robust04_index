			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> 7 HURT AS SHIPS COLLIDE OFF L.A.  </P> <P> A sportfishing boat and a supertanker hauling jet fuel collided in the darkness  just outside Los Angeles Harbor shortly before midnight, tossing the small boat  like a toy and injuring seven people, none seriously. One passenger jumped  overboard in fright.  </P> <P> The 35 passengers and 7 crew members of the 90-foot fishing boat Shogun were  hurled to the floor when the bow smashed into the Sealift Antarctic, a 564-foot  tanker on its way to San Francisco, the U.S. Coast Guard said. Forty barrels of  light jet fuel spilled into the sea, but officials said it evaporated rapidly  and posed little threat to the environment.  </P></p>

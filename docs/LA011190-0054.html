			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SAN GABRIEL;  </P> <P> ADMINISTRATOR TO RESIGN  </P> <P> City Administrator Robert Clute, who has held several closed door meetings with  the City Council recently to discuss his job, said Wednesday that he will  resign.  </P> <P> "I have advised the council of my intent to retire at such time as they can  conveniently have a successor on board," said the 16-year administrator,  refusing to elaborate. Clute, 64, whose annual salary is $82,000, came to San  Gabriel from Vancouver, Wash., where he had been city manager for eight years.  </P> <P> Clute's resignation marks the second time in recent months that a long-time  city official has left. Donald Tutich resigned as police chief last October.  </P></p>

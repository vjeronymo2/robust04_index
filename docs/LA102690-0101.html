			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS;  </P> <P> UNISYS POSTS $357-MILLION LOSS IN PERIOD  </P> <P> Raising fears that its very survival may be at stake, Unisys Corp. on Thursday  reported a $357-million third-quarter loss and said it expects more red ink in  the closing months of the year, even as it aggressively trims its work force  and sheds operations.  </P> <P> The nation's third-largest computer maker -- which has lost nearly $1 billion  in the last 21 months following an overly ambitious expansion effort and poor  electronics sales -- also announced that it would reduce its work force of  75,000 by 5,000 in the coming months. That's the third such cut in the last two  years.  </P> <P> In addition, Unisys said, W. Michael Blumenthal has stepped down as chairman  nine months after giving up the chief executive post. Blumenthal, a former  Treasury secretary, guided Unisys' creation four years ago from the merger of  Burroughs and Sperry and then designed its bold but ill-fated expansion drive.  </P> <P> Unisys said Blumenthal, 64, stepped down to devote full time to his  international investment banking career at Lazard Freres, one of the companies  Unisys said it recently retained to step up its efforts to sell operating  units. The sales are designed to generate cash needed to pay down its  staggering $3.9-billion debt.  </P> <P> The combination of news sent the company's stock, which had traded as high as  $30.50 a share about 20 months ago, down again on the New York Stock Exchange.  It closed at $3.375 per share, down 12.5 cents for the day. The news also  prompted Standard &amp; Poor's to lower by one notch its rating of $4 billion  in Unisys debt.  </P> <P> Wall Street analysts, skeptical about the company's prospects for months, said  the latest reports underscore Unisys' precarious position, particularly as the  economy continues to slide and the company remains burdened by a debt load more  than double the industry average.  </P> <P> The major remaining question, analysts said, is whether James A. Unruh -- who  took over as chief executive from Blumenthal early this year and now replaces  him as chairman -- can move quickly enough with the asset sales to prevent  further damage.  </P> <P> "The issue is whether they can get enough breathing space," said Stephen Cohen,  a technology analyst with Soundview Financial in Stamford, Conn. "This business  can shrink itself and find a vital core, but it has to move quickly."  </P> <P> With other troubled electronics companies, such as Wang Laboratories and  Control Data, aggressively trying to shed unwanted operations, Unisys may not  be able to find buyers for its assets, analysts said. Although Unisys has not  said what units are for sale, analysts said operations on the sales block might  include Unisys' defense unit, which two years ago was among the aerospace  companies caught in the federal government's defense fraud probe, Ill Wind.  Also said to be up for sale are Unisys' one-third stake in Japanese computer  marketer Nihon Unisys Ltd. and its Timeplex Inc. data transmission unit.  </P> <P> Despite the slump, Unisys said Timeplex, its defense unit and sales in Asia and  the Pacific were doing well. It also said cash flow had increased significantly  over last year.  </P> <P> "We remain confident of our course toward restoring the company to  profitability and reducing its debt load," chief Unruh said.  </P> <P> The company's latest loss compared to a loss of $648 million in the year-ago  third quarter. Sales in the quarter were $2.4 billion, up 2% from the $2.35  billion posted a year ago.  </P></p>

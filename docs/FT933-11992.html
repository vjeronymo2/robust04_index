			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Business and the Law: Judicial scheme to offer private appraisal - Legal Briefs The UK's Centre for Dispute Resolution, an industry-backed non-profit making organisation set up in 1990 to promote alternative dispute resolution (ADR), has launched a judicial appraisal scheme which will offer businesses a new private judging service. The scheme offers a 'fast track' method by which potential litigants can seek an independent assessment of their case from senior lawyers drawn from a panel of experienced barristers and former High Court judges. Parties can then choose to negotiate a settlement or opt for mediation. Users of the scheme can agree to treat the assessment as binding. Alternatively, they can use it as a means of narrowing down the issues for future trial. The costs of using the scheme will range from Pounds 750 a day, depending on the value of the claim. Similar techniques have been used in the US under names such as Rent-A-Judge or Judicial Arbitration &amp; Mediation Services, which fields 200 former US judges.</p>

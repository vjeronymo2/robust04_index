			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'RESTORE THE PUBLIC TRUST'  </P> <P> I have grown weary of proposals such as that suggested in your editorial, which  advocate raising the salaries of public officials as a method of reducing the  amount of political corruption plaguing this nation. Rather than placing the  responsibility for their behavior squarely on the persons who engage in  unethical or illegal activities, this solution instead implies that "the poor  politicians can't help themselves" and blames the citizenry by stating in  effect that voters get what they pay for.  </P> <P> People whose integrity does not fluctuate in relation to their salaries should  find such implications not only offensive, but alarming. Is it so irrational to  expect elected officials to exercise sound moral judgment simply because it is  the correct thing to do? Even if salaries were increased to a level which would  enable public officials "to maintain a reasonable standard of living,"  certainly such salaries will never satiate the greed of those politicians for  whom money and power are more important than their constituencies.  </P> <P> What a shame that all around us, in local, state and national politics, we are  witnessing the results of a political ethic based on self-interest rather than  on service to others.  </P> <P> KATHLEEN A. McDONALD  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

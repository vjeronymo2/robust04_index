			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / International Company News: Mixed results at US paper groups US paper and forest products groups continue to report mixed second-quarter results. Boise Cascade yesterday showed a decline in second-quarter losses, to Dollars 19.2m, or 86 cents a share, from losses before special charges of Dollars 22.1m, or 85 cents, in the same 1993 quarter. Louisiana-Pacific, meanwhile, reported record second-quarter earnings, at Dollars 81.0m or 75 cents a share, up from Dollars 65.7m, or 60 cents, in the 1993 second quarter. Second-quarter sales at Boise Cascade were Dollars 1.1bn, up from Dollars 974m a year ago. The company said most of the sales improvement stemmed from recent acquisitions in its office products business, and from rising demand in its building products sector. That sector's earnings also improved because the price of logs, the raw material for building products, moderated during the quarter. However, operating losses in Boise Cascade's paper segment deepened during the quarter. The company said average prices for its largest-volume grades, uncoated free sheet and newsprint, were down about 6 per cent. Weak prices, it added, were only partly offset by lower unit manufacturing costs and increased volume. Sales at Louisiana-Pacific rose to Dollars 775m from Dollars 597m a year ago. 'Although the quarter started off slowly, as questions about interest rates put some building products buying decisions on hold, business picked up steadily during the quarter,' said Mr Harry Merlo, chairman. 'As we enter the second half of the year, numbers for housing starts, building permits and existing home sales are strong,' he said. Mr Merlo said the company's pulp market had also improved dramatically over a year ago, with the prices of some grades rising by as much as 75 per cent.</p>

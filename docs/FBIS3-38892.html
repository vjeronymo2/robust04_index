			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri by </F> Toni Fontana in Rome; date not given: "The West Should Show  Resoluteness, Like in Kuwait"]    [Text] [Fontana] Minister Fabbri, these are crucial hours  for Bosnia.    [Fabbri] It is up to the UN Secretary General to make a  decision; this time he can take this step without the Security  Council pronouncing on the issue first.    [Fontana] Butrus-Ghali seems to have decided.    [Fabbri] The green light has not yet been given. The tragedy  of the marketplace in Sarajevo seems to have brought some  prospect of a slackening of the tension. There could be a  chance that Sarajevo might be demilitarized. If there is, we  must do all we can to find a settlement. But there is one  nonnegotiable point: Even in the face of this potential opening,  the West must demonstrate that it really is ready to use  military force as well.    [Fontana] There are those who compare the European  democracies' attitude toward Bosnia to their behavior toward  Nazi Germany.    [Fabbri] I will note what we Italians will do. Our bases are  ready to support military initiatives, as they did with the  "no-fly-zone" operation. As a politician, I do not want to feel  ashamed in a few years' time of having retreated into  realpolitik in the face of an unparalleled tragedy, the only  precedent for which is the Holocaust. We must show the same  determination displayed in Kuwait, otherwise the free western  democracies and the international community will have no excuse.    [Fontana] Is military intervention, in other words bombing  the artillery posts that are pounding Sarajevo, "technically"  feasible?    [Fabbri] We must use all the means at our disposal,  including  military means, as the foreign affairs minister has rightly  said. Italy backs the "Juppe ultimatum."    [Fontana] But is intervention possible?    [Fabbri] There is no decisive or conclusive intervention.  One might imagine military initiatives triggered by failure to  comply with the ultimatum or by the UN ascertaining that the  entire responsibility for the marketplace massacre is to be laid  at the Serbs' door. Military experts, too, have mentioned the  possibility of air strikes against the main "sources of fire"  that are strangling Sarajevo, the helpless victim of genocide  from above. Of course, we cannot rely too much on the  investigation into the marketplace massacre; there may be no  "technical proof," as lawyers used to call it, but there is no  lack of "deductive proof" that the bombs were fired by the  Serbs, as they always have been.    [Fontana] So what sort of military operation might be  decided  on?    [Fabbri] One might imagine air strikes against the gun posts  and air raids in support of the UN forces, if they come under  attack. NATO has been asked to plan an operation and it has  done so, and the Italian bases are ready.    [Fontana] Would Italian planes take part in the operations  too?    [Fabbri] We have been asked to provide logistic and  operational support, which is in place and is complete. This is  no negligible contribution, and we are ready to provide  effective support both for the air strikes and for the other  operations.    [Fontana] So there is no talk of troop intervention on the  ground?    [Fabbri] None at all, at the moment. We have to see which  targets might be knocked out with air strikes, whether the  fighter planes have to hit "top priority" targets, by which I  mean the gun posts, or "secondary priority" targets as well,  munitions dumps and so on ... These are the options open to us.  The United States is right to ask Europe to do its duty. This  time we cannot delegate everything to the United States; in the  face of a war on our own doorstep, Europe must play its part.    [Fontana] How might Italian public opinion react to the  decision to carry out air strikes?    [Fabbri] The operation would be authorized by the United  Nations and carried out by NATO. The Italians would welcome it  as a rightful decision, there would be a sense of relief. No  one is pretending there would be no risk, no danger, no  consequences; but we must not forget the lessons of the thirties.    [Fontana] However, Moscow does not agree.    [Fabbri] We in the West must not allow ourselves to be  unduly  swayed by Russian diplomacy's benevolence toward Serbia. Russia  has condemned the massacre in the marketplace, but we know what  Moscow's position has been in the long Yugoslav tragedy. Let us  take it into account without giving it too much weight. The  West cannot betray its duty. Last but not least, I should like  to repeat that the Italian navy and air force are ready to step  up their humanitarian aid operations, transporting civilians and  the wounded. Peace is not just around the corner. We must get  ready for a massive humanitarian aid operation.    [Fontana] Minister Fabbri, another Italian has fallen in  Somalia. They are shooting at the soldiers. A few days ago,  you said that "intelligence sources" gave grounds for fearing  this sort of thing. What is happening in Mogadishu?    [Fabbri] There are attacks and assaults on the UN forces,  protest marches. The tension is mounting again. The Italians  have carried out widespread operations confiscating weapons from  the factions. The Somali armed groups think that once the  western forces have left they can resume their armed warfare,  and they are trying to get back the weapons that we have taken.  The moment of withdrawal is the most sensitive and difficult  moment. Unfortunately, we were expecting these fresh outbreaks  of guerrilla warfare. We have planned withdrawal according to a  schedule that we will adhere to. There are those who say,  "Bring them all home immediately," but we cannot because we have  agreed our schedule with UNOSOM [UN Operation in Somalia] and  the Germans, who are unarmed and are leaving with us. We shall  be keeping our eyes wide open.</p>

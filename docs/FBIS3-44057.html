			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Enoch Sithole] </F>   [Text] The list of people nominated to be ANC [African  National Congress] members of parliament in the National  Assembly has raised concerns over the exclusion of certain  people who had originally been nominated by the branches or  regions of the organisation. Most serious, however, is the  inclusion of certain people who had not been nominated by the  regions or branches.    One of the most noticeable exclusions is that of former  KaNgwane chief minister, Enos Mabuza, who was number 62 on the  list, but who was convinced to stay out because of his  membership of the SA Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board.  Other names that have been struck off the list are those of  Sheila Sisulu, Franklin Sonn, Professor Njabulo Ndebele and  Billy Modise, also because of their membership of the SABC board.    Most controversial is the including of people like Gazankulu  chief minister, Samuel Nxumalo, who never featured in the list  submitted by the Northern Transvaal region of the ANC. Nxumalo  is but one of the names that was included in the list by the  National Executive Committee (NEC) of the ANC so as to comply  with the undertaking to include representatives of organisations  that are members of the Patriotic Front.    People like Lebowa chief minister Nelson Ramodike featured  in  the list of the Northern Transvaal region as they made an  undertaking at an early stage that they were prepared to fight  the election under the ANC umbrella. Nxumalo's Ximoko  Progressive Party (XPP), on the other hand, announced only last  week that it was going to fight the election together with the  ANC.    Sources from the Northern Transvaal region of the ANC said  they expected their grassroots membership to strongly object to  Nxumalo's name being on the ANC list.    A meeting has been arranged for this week between XPP and  the  ANC where the former will apparently extract a commitment to ANC  policies by the latter. An irate delegate from that region said  he was happy that ANC leader Nelson Mandela was going to tour  the area shortly to hold People's Forums. "He will answer for  the NEC why people like this were included," he said.    Nxumalo told SUNDAY NATION that he was happy to be on the  ANC  list. Nxumalo, who a few months ago shared a platform with  state president F.W. de Klerk at a National Party [NP] rally in  Pietersburg, admitted that some members of his party were more  lenient towards the NP and said he would "try" to persuade them  to understand "the concept of liberation".    Eastern Transvaal and the Western Cape are also fuming over  Mabuza's and Sonn's exclusion, respectively. One Western Cape  region delegate at the ANC's conference being held at Nasrec [a  conference center] in Johannesburg said: "They (the NEC) should  at least have referred the names back to us for our consent."    Meanwhile, other prominent ANC leaders do not feature in the  National Assembly list as they will stand for the Senate and the  provincial legislatures. Assistant general secretary Jacob Zuma  is not on the list as he is the organisation's choice for the  premiership of the Natal province. Other popular figures like  Matthew Phosa, Terror Lekota, Allan Boesak and Tokyo Sexwale are  not on the list as they have been chosen to stand as premiers of  their respective regions. Stalwarts like Govan Mbeki and Harry  Gwala are also not on the list after having asked to be left to  stand in their regions.    Cheryl Carolus, head of the ANC's health department, was a  surprise omission. She told SUNDAY NATION that while she spent  most of her life in the struggle she never dreamed of becoming a  politician.    ANC deputy-president Walter Sisulu is also not on the list.  When asked why, he said: "You will find me in other tasks."  His wife Albertina is number 10 on the list.    Some candidates on the list are most likely to forfeit their  present positions in churches, trade unions and other civil  society organisations. At the time of going to press, the  general secretary of the Institute of Contextual Theology,  Catholic priest Father Smangaliso Mkhatshwa, was having a  meeting with the church council to decide his future. This  comes after a call by People John II that Catholic priests  should choose between politics and their religious work.  Another cleric on the list is Sister Bernard Ncube.    Police, Prisons and Civil Rights' Union president Gregory  Rockman resigned from the union after he heard he was on the ANC  list.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Taipei, March 26 (CNA) -- Legislator Jaw Shau-kong  on Saturday [26 March] suggested that the government investigate  the interception of a Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)  plane by two Japanese fighter planes.    The CAA plane was conducting regular tests off Taiwan's  northeast coast Friday morning when two F-4 Phantom planes from  the Japanese Air Force scrambled to make an interception,  according to the pilot of the test plane.    The pilot said that the two fighters were flying [words  indistinct] below his plane before they climbed to the same  altitude after making sure that it was an unarmed civilian plane.    He said that the two fighters tailed him for some distance  before they disengaged, after which he continued to fly in a  northeasterly direction to carry out the testing mission.    Jaw said the two Japanese fighters blatantly disregarded  Taiwan airspace during the incident.    He suggested that the government make a thorough  investigation and lodge a protest with Japan.    Meanwhile, Cheng Pingaliang [spelling of name as received],  CAA deputy director, said that the event Friday may be a result  on faulty coordination between Japanese air traffic controllers  and the Japanese Air Force.    Chang said that the CAA notified a Japanese air traffic  control center about the planned test flight before it was  carried out. He said that the two Japanese fighters were merely  making an identification of the plane.</p>

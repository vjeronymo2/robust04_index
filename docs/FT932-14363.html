			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (16): Creating and maintaining an image - In-flight catering When passengers complain, it is usually because they did not get the special meal they ordered, says Mr Kurt Hafner, British Airways' Swiss-born director of catering. 'But then some people tell us that their doctor has prescribed them caviar.' Airline catering is a frustrating business. Food is difficult to prepare at 40,000 feet, fish dries out in the arid atmosphere, omelettes harden, wine loses its bouquet, champagne fizzes a little too energetically for its own good. The habits of the passengers are no help. How does one keep food fresh when Scandinavians want to lunch at 11am while Spaniards want it at 3pm. . . just when the British are beginning to think about tea? Americans are ready to sleep at 10pm when the Spaniards, again, are ready to launch into a full-scale dinner. Yet the caterers have come a long way from the days when airline food was often a flying fiasco. Today you can eat caviar on Cathay Pacific, lobster in brandy sauce on Singapore Airlines and drink classed-growth Bordeaux wines on British Airways. Even economy class has been known to be on the receiving end of a little smoked salmon. BA spends Pounds 25m a year on beverages alone. Champagne accounts for more than 40 per cent of the wine budget and less than 20 per cent of the volume. The airline has placed the largest order on record with a New Zealand winery, Nobilo, and each year goes through 18,000 cases, at nine litres a case, of its white wine. Air France has just 'redefined the whole of in-flight catering after a long-term study'. It now has 'an energy brunch, because the passengers are really preparing for a competition.' The afternoon sees a gouter d'affaires or business tea-time. It claims to be the biggest single buyer of champagne in the world, but is still worried about competing with Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines on the level of its first-class wines. Airlines employ famous chefs as consultants. These include Alice Waters of California's Chez Panisse (American Airlines), Shaun Hill of Gidleigh Park, in Devon (United Airlines) and Michel Roux of London's Le Gavroche (British Airways). Their wine advisers include British Masters of Wine and US professors of oenology. These experts hold blindfold wine tastings, some after the wine has been on a transatlantic flight, in the hunt for the right drink with which to toast that business deal. Surely no one chooses to fly on an airline because they had a nice drink last time? Maybe they do. The latest survey of business air travellers by the International Air Transport Association (Iata) show meals to be the fourth most important aspect of travelling in business class. It comes after seat size, faster check-in and lack of crowds, but ahead of frequent flyer programmes and ticket flexibility. There is also evidence to suggest that passengers are hesitant about admitting that food and wine are important. In spite of advance market research, Virgin Atlantic has found it necessary to introduce a welcome glass of champagne on its Mid-Class - a business class-sized seat on a full economy fare ticket - after pressure from passengers accustomed to the treat in business class on other airlines. Catering has also become a means for airlines to stamp individuality on a service. This is important in an era when safety is taken for granted, delays are usually out of airlines' control and schedules and destinations can vary little between airlines. Airlines are therefore taking an ever-more marketing-oriented approach to catering. Food is served as a 'destination feature' with hamburgers or pizzas to the US, for example. Cathay Pacific is using illawarra plums and ground wattle seeds as part of an Australian theme this spring. Airlines take notice of consumer surveys of the quality of food and wine on aircraft. BA, by its own admission, used to have a haphazard wine operation until the mid-1980s. It was shocked out of its complacency by a magazine survey which placed its wines 16th in a list of 16 airlines, according to Mr Peter Nixson , BA's head of wine and beverage development. Now BA serves 7,000 cases of one premier cru white Burgundy a year and would consider serving a grand cru if it could be sure of delivery in high enough volumes. The effort in airline catering is being redoubled now that the recession has encouraged companies to demand better value for money for their business-class and first-class tickets. Traditional high luxury is being replaced by lighter fare. Many airlines are considering extending their services to airport lounges so that passengers on short overnight trips can eat before take-off and use the flying time to sleep. Yet despite the need to be especially cost-conscious during the world economic slowdown, airlines remain convinced of the importance of catering in creating and maintaining an image. 'Food has a powerful residual effect on the memory of a flight,' says Mr Hafner.</p>

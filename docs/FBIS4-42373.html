			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/442: "EU &amp; Black Sea Region </F>  Seek  Cooperation in Energy"]    [Text] Mr. Marcelino Oreja, European Commissioner for  energy and transport, will participate in an international  conference to be held in Chalkidiki, Greece on 30 and 31 May,  entitled "New Energy Realities in the Black Sea region."    This conference has a view to developing cooperation in the  field of energy between the EU [European Union] and the Black  Sea region countries, paving the way for European Energy  industry and opening up Union markets to these rapidly  developing economies.    It is the first time the EU and the member states of the  Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organisation, (BSEC) (Albania,  Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece, Moldova,  Romania, Russia, Turkey, and the Ukraine) meet at ministerial  level to discuss and coordinate aspects of energy policy. In  addition, the Central Asian states of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,  Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan will take part in the  conference. Delegations will normally be led by ministers but  in some cases by vice premiers.    The delegates will be addressed by Commissioner Marcelino  Oreja as well as the president of the Council of Ministers  (energy) Kostantinos Simitos.    The conference will focus on energy policy coordination and  opportunities for cooperation in the areas of investment, trade,  and transit, environment protection, security of supply and the  implementation of the European energy charter. At the business  level, bilateral and multilateral meetings between senior  representatives from banks, industry, and energy companies have  been arranged. The conference's organisers, the  directorate-general for energy, led by Director General  Constantinos Maniatopoulos, expect a successful outcome,  including concrete projects for cooperation involving the EU,  its member states and the Black Sea countries.</p>

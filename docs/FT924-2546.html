			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow declines despite good economic data Wall Street PROFIT-TAKING weighed on US share prices despite more good news on inflation and jobs, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 11.62 at 3,312.19, but off its lows for the day when the index had been down more than 20 points. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.99 lower at 434.66, the Amex composite down 0.59 at 392.39 and the Nasdaq composite off 4.99 at 658.93. Turnover on the NYSE was 242m shares, and declines outdistanced rises by 1,043 to 775. Signs that the market's recent rally may be running out of steam were evident when prices failed to rise after the Labor Department reported that producer prices fell 0.2 per cent in November, following a 0.1 per cent decline the previous month, and that weekly jobless claims in late November fell by 38,000. Both sets of data were better than analysts had expected. The producer prices figure was particularly encouraging, as it confirmed that inflationary pressures are not building up despite evidence that the recovery is gathering pace. The market failed to respond positively to the data, primarily because the initial rush of investor demand that has powered several indices to new highs over the past few weeks is clearly waning. General Motors eased Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 33 3/8 on the news that the car manufacturer faces a law suit filed on behalf of some purchasers of pick-up trucks with fuel tanks located outside the frame. Other motor stocks were also weaker, with Chrysler Dollars  3/4 lower at Dollars 32 1/4 and Ford down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 42 3/4 . Equitable rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 13 3/4 in turnover of 1.8m shares on news that the company had formed a strategic partnership with Unum, the specialist Maine-based insurer, to sell Unum-designed individual disability insurance products. Unum firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 53 3/4 . Chock Full O' Nuts rose Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 8 1/4 after reporting fiscal first quarter net income of 12 cents a share, up from 5 cents a share a year earlier. The company also said it expected profits for the full year 1993 to come in above analysts' forecasts of 45 cents a share. Delta Air Lines firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 51 1/2 after the company said that contrary to reports, it was not currently considering suspending its quarterly dividend or planning job layoffs. On the Nasdaq market, Microsoft fell Dollars 3 to Dollars 89 in volume of 2.8m shares on a downgrade from Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, which believes that the company will not exceed analysts' earnings expectations. Hopes that the company would do just that have been behind the recent surge in Microsoft shares. Canada TORONTO stocks partly recouped earlier losses, but still finished nearly 0.5 per cent lower after a heavy trading session. The TSE-300 fell 15.3 to 3,270.2 on volume of 44.7m shares valued at CDollars 351m. Declines outpaced advances, 335 to 275, with 304 issues unchanged.</p>

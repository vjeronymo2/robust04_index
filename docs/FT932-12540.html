			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Wellcome transfers Dollars 400m to US trust THE WELLCOME Trust, the largest UK medical charity, is to transfer Dollars 400m (Pounds 260m) to its smaller sister organisation in the US over the next five years, Clive Cookson writes. The gift to the Burroughs Wellcome Fund may disappoint some British researchers who had counted on receiving all the money the trust received after last July's sale of its majority stake in Wellcome, the drugs company. Mr Roger Gibbs, chairman of the Wellcome Trust, said it was the governors' prime duty 'to interpret the will and wishes of the founder Sir Henry Wellcome', who was born and educated in the US. 'We believe it would be Sir Henry's fervent wish that the trust should make a significant contribution to medical research in the US.' Dr Bridget Ogilvie, director, said the gift would amount to about 5 per cent of the trust's total asset base - Pounds 5.4bn at current stock prices. Because it was a transfer of capital and would not be paid out of current income, the gift would not affect immediately the grants to UK researchers, which have been rising rapidly for several years and will be about Pounds 140m this year. Dr Ogilvie said there was also a message to politicians in the UK: 'It's not our duty to save British science - that's the government's duty.' The total spending of the Wellcome Trust and smaller medical charities has overtaken that of the state-funded Medical Research Council, which spends about Pounds 200m a year on grants. The gift will transform the fortunes of the Burroughs Wellcome Fund - which has a capital base of only Dollars 35m, disbursing Dollars 4m a year in grants - into one of the top 50 non-profit foundations in the US over the next five years. The fund's directors have not yet decided how to spend the money, but it is expected to concentrate on giving grants to promising young researchers and to research into neglected areas such as parasitology.</p>

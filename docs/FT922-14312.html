			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Directors stand firm amid social forces THE TYPICAL director of a quoted British company is a 52-year-old male chartered accountant, a study of UK management has shown. He will probably have gone to a grammar school and is also likely to be a golfer. If he belongs to a club, he is most likely to be a member of the Royal Automobile Club or the Middlesex Cricket Club. The analysis of British directors shows an apparently unchanged group in spite of the social forces of the past decade. It is contained in the Arthur Andersen Corporate Register, a twice-yearly directory of UK management. From a database of 20,000 directors and corporate officers at 1,612 fully listed and unlisted securities market companies, only 426 women hold senior management positions. Their average age is 47. Of the directors who admitted to a professional qualification, chartered accountancy was most frequent, followed by chartered surveying. Eton was the most commonly mentioned public school and Cambridge the most popular university. The typical board has seven or eight directors, including three non-executive directors. Arthur Andersen Corporate Register. Hemmington Scott Publishing, 26-31 Whiskin St, London. EC1R 0BP. Pounds 150 yearly.</p>

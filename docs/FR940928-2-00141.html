			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Alliance Capital Management L.P., an indirectly majority-owned subsidiary of Equitable, provides administrative and advisory services to the Hudson River Trust. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicant's Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Section 9(a) automatically disqualifies a company from serving as an adviser, depositor or principal underwriter to a registered investment company if the company or an affiliate has an employee, officer or director who has been convicted of a securities-related offense or enjoined by a court from serving in a securities-related position. The purpose of Section 9(a) is to prevent persons of questionable character from occupying positions of influence over registered investment companies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Rules 6e&hyph;2 and 6e&hyph;3(T) provide certain exemptions from the automatic disqualification provisions of Section 9(a). Paragraphs (b)(4) and (b)(15) of Rules 6e&hyph;2 and 6e&hyph;3(T) restrict the applicability of Section 9(a) to persons who participate directly in the management or administration of the separate account and the underlying fund, or in the sale of the variable life contracts funded by the separate account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. There is no rule affording similar relief with respect to insurance company separate accounts funding variable annuity contracts, such as the Separate Accounts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Equitable has approximately 5,200 non-officer employees and 8,000 insurance agents who are registered representatives, in addition to its officers and directors. Section 9(a) applies to Equitable, as depositor and principal underwriter of the Separate Accounts, and to its affiliates, as investment advisers and principal underwriters of registered investment companies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Section 9(a) would automatically disqualify Equitable and its affiliates from serving as depositor, principal underwriter or investment adviser if any one of their employees became disqualified under Section 9(a), even if the employee worked in one of Equitable's businesses not regulated under the 1940 Act and did not participate in the management or administration of the Separate Accounts or the Hudson River Trust, or in the sale of variable annuity contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Equitable seeks an order limiting the automatic disqualification provisions of Section 9(a) with respect to the Separate Accounts to the same basis available to separate accounts funding variable life insurance contracts by Rules 6e&hyph;2 and 6e&hyph;3(T). Equitable asserts that the intended focus of Section 9(a) is on the operation of investment companies and not on ancillary businesses unrelated to investment company operations and management. Equitable states that its requested relief is consistent with the purpose of Section 9(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Equitable contends that the Commission already has recognized the appropriateness of limiting the disqualification provisions of Section 9(a) with respect to variable annuity operations by granting applications permitting ``mixed funding.'' <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  As a result, underlying management investment companies that will be used to fund both variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance contracts have been required to file applications under Section 6(c). The Commission has granted numerous such exemptive orders under delegated authority. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The use of a common underlying investment management company to fund both variable life insurance contracts and variable annuity contracts is known as ``mixed funding.'' In order to qualify for exemptions from the requirements of Section 9(a), Rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) prohibits mixed funding and Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) permits mixed funding only if several conditions are met. The conditions are that the underlying management investment company's board of directors, a majority of whom are not interested persons of the company, will monitor for the existence of any material irreconcilable conflict between the interests of variable annuity contractholders and variable life scheduled or flexible contractholders investing in such company. The life insurer must agree to report any potential or existing conflicts to the directors. If a conflict arises, the life insurer must, at its own cost, remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company and segregating the assets underlying the variable annuity contracts and the variable life scheduled or flexible contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> E.g., The Quest for value Accumulation Trust, et al., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Investment Company Act Release Nos. 19670 (Sept. 1, 1993) (Notice) and 19749 (Sept. 29, 1993) (Order);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Maxim Series Fund, Inc., et al., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Investment Company Act Release Nos. 19616 (Aug. 6, 1993) (Notice) and 19676 (Sept. 2, 1993) (Order);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> New York Life MFA Series Fund, Inc., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Investment Company Act Release Nos. 19010 (Oct. 8, 1992) (Notice) and 19069 (Oct. 30, 1993) (Order). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

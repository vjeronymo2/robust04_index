			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian </F> delegation to the Cairo talks, by Sa'id Mu'addi; place not  given, on 13 April; from the "With the Events" program --  recorded]    [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, good evening.    [Sha'th] Good evening.    [Mu'addi] What is your comment on the incident that took  place in Hadera today?    [Sha'th] We can feel only pain and sorrow for the continuing  innocent civilian victims in the ongoing conflict in which  scores of the sons of our people in Hebron and Gaza have been  killed, and the same holds for the victims from the sons of the  Israeli people in 'Afula, and Hadera today. We always say we  face these operations with anger and denunciation because they  strike only innocent civilians on both sides. We say the only  way to stop this violence on both sides is by quickly signing  the peace agreement and really implementing it on the ground.  This will create new conditions, end all violent acts from both  sides, and abort all the attempts to torpedo the peace  agreement. Our position on this subject is firm and unchanged.  I pray for almighty God to help us reach a quick peace  agreement that protects the sons of our people everywhere, and  that protects Israeli civilians everywhere, in order to reach  lasting and just peace.    [Mu'addi] Progress in the Palestinian-Israeli talks took  place yesterday, and this incident took place today. Do such  incidents influence the peace process?    [Sha'th] We can either bow to these incidents and allow them  to obstruct the peace process, or we can expedite the peace  process in order to stop these incidents. I believe the second  option is better. We should create conditions on the ground  that make it impossible for these operations to continue, or at  least make them very difficult. I feel pain whenever an  incident targets civilians. This was my feeling after the Hebron  and Gaza incidents, and it was the same yesterday concerning the  incident that took place in the al-Wahidi house in Ramallah. I  have this feeling any time the sons of our people suffer as a  result of the continuation of this situation. I have the same  feelings toward the families of those who were killed in Hadera  and 'Afula.    [Mu'addi] Did the Israelis and the Palestinians have  contacts  over the past few hours to prepare for the resumption of talks  next Sunday?    [Sha'th] We have constant contacts. I think we will begin  new talks next Sunday morning.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, thank you very much.    [Sha'th] Thank you.</p>

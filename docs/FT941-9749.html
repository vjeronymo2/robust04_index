			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: All the facts you can take - Kevin Goldstein-Jackson samples two screen-based information services I am an information junkie. I read three daily newspapers, five Sunday papers, and subscribe to 48 magazines and three newsletters. Unfortunately, I tend to remember only the more unusual items - such as the claim that elephant trunk, if cooked for 16 hours, tastes rather like roast beef. Or that licking a cane toad can cause hallucinations due to the bufotenine toxin it contains. I still remember the sad report in 1976 of the Japanese businessman who was killed on a golf course when lightning struck the metal zip on his trousers. I have favoured plastic buttons ever since. In an average year, I look at more than 300 company reports to shareholders. Did you know that the McVitie's factory in Manchester can produce 3m Jaffa cakes a day for United Biscuits? Or that it takes cleaners a month to wash all 3,678 windows of the Transamerica pyramid in San Francisco? The problem with looking at millions of facts and figures is that you can get an information overload. It can be difficult to recall what is useful rather than merely interesting. It was, therefore, with some trepidation that I accepted an offer recently to try out two more sources of information: Market-Eye* and Financial Alert**. I already use the telextext services displaying share prices and financial news on BBC-2 and Channel 4, but Market-Eye promised much more. It displays real-time share price information direct from the London Stock Exchange. Last month, it added an 'up to the minute news service'. I was concerned that I might be tempted to sit in front of the screen all day, watching the 'moving price ticker' or the 'high' and 'low' prices for more than 3,000 equities. I feared I might turn into a gambler, trying to beat the professionals by using the screen information to buy and sell very rapidly in an attempt to make quick profits. So, Market-Eye was installed in a bedroom next to my study. That way, I thought, I would be less likely to become addicted to the screen. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to use the system. Market-Eye simply plugs into an ordinary television aerial socket, so there are no expensive connection costs. The keypad is designed very well for adult fingers and it is possible to sort through hundreds of pages filled with real-time data including foreign exchange details, SEAQ International, 'shares on the move,' gilts - even a list of suspended equities, with the dates of their suspension. The news service includes corporate results and a variety of company announcements. Rather than wasting hours, I find Market-Eye is actually saving me time. By pushing a few buttons, my portfolio is displayed on the screen with the latest information. It is also possible to download certain information onto a personal computer. The only drawback is the cost. Buying Market-Eye - comprising monitor, receiver and keypad - costs Pounds 1,521.63 (inc VAT). To this must be added an annual subscription charge (including maintenance) of Pounds 1,051.63. Financial Alert is especially helpful for people who travel a lot and do not have easy access to a teletext service. It is a portable, hand-held machine rather like a large pocket calculator which works on rechargeable batteries. Using the keys, a small, built-in screen can display company prices for the FT-100 as well as around 800 other British listings. There is also a news service, although the size of the screen restricts the amount that can be provided. Financial Alert costs Pounds 199.50, plus a 'one-time connection charge' of Pounds 75. Various monthly charges apply, depending on the services used, but there is a minimum monthly fee of Pounds 82.50. Mind you, despite these technological wonders, I still maintain my craving for printed facts. The Transamerica report to shareholders reveals that the average American consumes 25lb of bananas, 24lb of lettuce, 19lb of apples and 3lb of pears each year. *Market-Eye, ICV, Pellipar House, 9 Cloak Lane, Cannon Street, London EC4R 2RU.

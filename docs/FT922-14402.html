			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / UK Company News: Aviva swings sharply to losses of Dollars 8.72m Aviva Petroleum, the Texas-based but London-quoted oil and gas company, swung sharply from profits of Dollars 739,061 to pre-tax losses of Dollars 8.72m (Pounds 5.06m) in the year to December 31. In January the company appointed as deputy chairman Mr Graham Ferguson Lacey, the evangelical preacher who heads Gulf Resources Chemical Corporation, the group that recently bought Land's End and John O'Groats. The losses were blamed on the Florida dry hole, revenues down to Dollars 9.32m (Dollars 12.3m) and substantially lower gas prices. Operating losses totalled Dollars 6.91m (Dollars 2.68m) after dry holes and abandonments took more at Dollars 2.99m (Dollars 165,336). Below that, interest took Dollars 557,760 (gain Dollars 3.21m) and the foreign exchange deficit was Dollars 149,892 (credit Dollars 2.1m). Losses per share grew to 1.67 cents (earnings 0.1 cents). The Canadian debt has been paid off and current debt amounts to Dollars 3.9m, down from Dollars 24.8m at the 1990 year-end. In February, Aviva shareholders approved a 1-for-50 consolidation in order to gain a Nasdaq listing in the US.</p>

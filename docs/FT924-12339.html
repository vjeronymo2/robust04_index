			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Arts: 'Iceman' worth waiting for - Dublin Theatre Festival This new version of Tartuffe by the young playwright Michael West is the Gate's contribution to the Dublin Theatre Festival. It is a lively and fluent rendering, but the edge of the original is lost by pitching this satire on hypocrisy somewhere between drawing room comedy and farce. Stephen Brennan in the title role is a creepy figure in a badly-hemmed black soutane, his waist encircled by a monster wooden rosary, a whiff of Rasputin about him. His sinister but rather sexy appearance is the only surprise of the evening. Catherine Byrne as Elmire, the object of his lust, is competently regal. Robert Ballagh provides an elegant if rather colourless set featuring classical French windows and statue-filled alcoves. The production is consistently played for laughs, and results a tame, safe evening's theatre with about as much excitement as a television adaptation. There is nothing tame about the Abbey's Festival offering, the last major opening of a hitherto unspectacular fortnight. The Iceman Cometh was well worth waiting for. It is a monster of a play in four acts (with three intervals), but the long haul goes unnoticed in the presence of a truly great production of an essential classic. The way that Eugene O'Neill creates an existential masterpiece from the ramblings of a crew of drunken has-beens never fails to amaze. John Conklin's sets give us four different views of the bar and backroom of Harry Hope's clapped-out rooming house in dark shades of grey, brown and green, the chairs and tables as tatty and mismatched as their occupants. Michael Philippi's atmospheric lighting adds sudden new dimensions with precisely judged effects. The cast are largely comatose as they are introduced in the early morning light by the resident 'foolosopher', Larry, and the barman Frank. One by one they reveal their obsessive 'pipe-dreams' - the alcohol-fuelled illusions that allow them to believe in tomorrow, as they await the arrival of their salesman buddy, Hickey, and the ritual celebration of Harry's birthday. Hickey's entrance, larger than life in an immaculate pinstripe suit with his dazzling, cajoling salesman's smile, acts like a shot of adrenalin on Harry's somnolent roomers. But Hickey surprises them: he has turned teetotal and found 'peace', something that he says they can do too if they will only face up to reality and abandon all 'pipe-dreams'. Brian Dennehy who had the role of Hickey in Chicago with the same director, Robert Falls, is physically reminiscent of Billy Graham in his prime, and plays Hickey with the outstretched palms, the sincere facial expressions and the fancy footwork of an evangelical preacher. It is an astonishing performance in that while he is totally convincing on a realistic level in his dealings with 'the gang', the audience quickly grasps his evil, destructive intents: Hickey is 'the iceman'. Only the 'foolosopher', Larry, a tight and increasingly harrowing performance by Donald Moffat, sees him for what he is. Robert Falls has so successfully welded together Irish, English and American actors that it is impossible to tell the difference. The ensemble playing is first rate, as are the majority of the individual performances, notably Sean McGinley who gives dignity and intelligence to the all-important Frank. If any doubts remain about the judgment of the Abbey's artistic director, Garry Hynes, this memorable production should kill them dead. It is a theatre festival in itself, reminding us of what theatre is - or should be - all about. Tartuffe, Gate Theatre; The Iceman Cometh, The Abbey Theatre, Dublin</p>

			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: FICTION  </P> <P> BEGINNING THE WORLD AGAIN by Roberta Silman (Viking: $19.95; 416 pp.). Imagine  the secret, cloistered world of scientists and their families in Los Alamos,  New Mexico, working to create the first atomic bomb as World War II rages in  Europe.  </P> <P> This is the territory Roberta Stilman attempts to penetrate through the  fictional eyes of Lily Fialka, one of the women on "the Hill." Although there  are appearances by historical personalities including Robert Oppenheimer,  Enrico Fermi, even Churchill and Roosevelt, Silman's true focus is on the wives  of the scientists and their day-to-day lives in this tense, close-knit  community. The writing has the intimacy of a diary and can be quite moving. But  with so many accounts of the Manhattan Project written by the real physicists  who participated -- and who lived to regret their contributions -- one doubts  the relevance of these imagined characters, their ambivalent struggles, love  affairs and reconciliations.

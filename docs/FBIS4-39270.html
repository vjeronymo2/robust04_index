			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 6 Jun -- "The most dangerous thing now is to  begin to demolish everything and then to rebuild it yet again,  especially at a time when the national economy is in decline,  Anatoliy Holubchenko, Ukraine's minister of industry, believes.  There is a crisis both in the economy and in the structures of  power. Therefore, I fully share the concern of the parliament  chairman and his wish to form the Cabinet of Ministers quickly.  But we need to take measures urgently to stabilize the work of  the national economy complex." The new government, in Mr.  Holubchenko's opinion, will have to immediately take  untraditional steps, in the first place to adopt a series of  decisions on reorganizing production, and not allow 99 percent  of enterprises to stop. "The current campaign against inflation,  Anatoliy Holubchenko believes, has practically led to the  paralysis of enterprises."</p>

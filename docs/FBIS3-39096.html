At the Seibersdorf  research center, in Lower Austria, UN personnel of the  Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) will  be trained this year to inspect civilian chemical plants. The  OPCW inspectors should thus be able to ascertain whether  chemical weapons are being or can be produced in chemical  plants. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Usually they do not talk about water. And if they  do, it means there is a problem. This article was prompted as a  result of a drinking water inspection conducted by local  organizations of the Belstandart in conjunction with  representatives of the Sanitary and Epidemiologic Services at  the Belarusian Health Ministry.    Of 39 inspected water-supply facilities, only seven had  water  that was up to present safety standards. Serious violations of  chemical and microbiological requirements were reported at the  remaining facilities, which is 82.5 percent of those inspected.  For example, drinking water supplied by the Berestovtsy Housing  and Municipal Property Amalgamation failed to meet requirements  as to iron levels and intestine bacilli, while the water  supplied to residents of Novopoltsk was excessively hard and had  a high concentration of ammonia and its ions.    Also alarming are the results of an inspection conducted at  the Buda-Koshelev Housing and Municipal Property Amalgamation,  where the iron content and turbidity of drinking water are  beyond established limits.    What are the main reasons for such high pollution of the  drinking water? In the first place, it is an excessive  concentration of iron in underground waters, inefficient  iron-removing facilities or lack of those, lack of  water-treatment equipment, lax control over the quality of  drinking water on the part of relevant agencies.    Local Belstandart organizations levied fines on enterprises  violating water requirements. Officials found guilty of  permitting use of dirty water were severely reprimanded.  Findings of inspections of the Horodok, Beshenkovichi, and  Mozyr Housing and Municipal Property Amalgamations were sent to  the prosecutor's office.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish  at 1600 GMT on 1 June features the "Straight Talk" program with  host Osvaldo Rodriguez and Luis Sexto, both of BOHEMIA magazine.    Rodriguez begins by stating that efficiency is not a hollow  slogan and that the struggle to attain efficiency has barely  begun. Sexto states that slogans are good for mobilizing the  masses, but that "in the economy, slogans are harmful. The  economy is not advanced by slogans because we run the risk of  their becoming hollow. Slogans can be a mask behind which many  people hide their lack of effort or efficiency."    Sexto stresses that efficiency is vital to all societies and  to overcoming the dire situation Cuba is experiencing. He adds  that development is the result of efficiency, and praises the  Cuban Workers Federation's economic efficiency assemblies' goal  to motivate every worker.    Rodriguez adds: "In order to make efficiency a viable, truly  attainable goal, the concepts and mechanisms that direct our  economy must change, the concepts and mechanism that today  direct our economy." He states that it is important to embark on  this path with firmness, "ensuring that in the future we will  not regret having taken this path."    Sexto agrees, noting that the current assembly process seeks  to tap the workers' "subjective reserves" to solve collective  problems. Sexto also agrees that: "In order to attain efficiency  in Cuba, certain changes in the economic organization must be  made. I believe certain principles that have been followed for  many years must be changed because one way or another, they have  conditioned our widespread inefficiency. We must admit that Cuba  has done tremendous work over the past 35 years, but I believe  that work could have been even greater. I also believe that a  certain widespread inefficiency has limited that work because  the model and concepts used to direct our economy promoted  inefficiency."    He goes on to say that only through autonomous management  will the enterprises become efficient: "...although the word  autonomy scares many people. These people are those who, today,  we identify with the bureaucracy, and for whom autonomy  represents a loss of power." Sexto and Rodriguez agree that it  is difficult to pinpoint these people because they are people  who are trying to defend the Revolution, but who go about it the  wrong way.    Sexto again emphasizes the importance of autonomous  management for achieving efficiency, citing Ranchuelo's Cigar  Factory as an example. This factory produced the cigars, but did  not market them. That was done by another enterprise, which owed  4 million pesos to the factory. The factory, therefore, had to  seek bank loans to meet its payroll. The marketing enterprise  had no incentive to quickly pay the factory.    Rodriguez focuses on the individual workers' role in  attaining efficiency. Sexto notes that the worker's existence is  fully independent from the result of his labor. "You well know  that in Cuba, the egalitarian concepts that have tried to make  all workers equal have also created a schism between the worker  and his labor. Whether the lathe worker does good or bad work,  his job is not affected. If the factory is unprofitable, his job  is not affected. He continues to get the same salary. His life  is not changed."    Sexto reiterates that a link must be established between  performance, and salary or living conditions. Rodriguez agrees,  noting the example of an enterprise in which a manager did not  receive a salary for two months because of his inefficient  performance. Sexto again stresses the importance of the link  between performance and salary. Rodriguez closes by reiterating  that efficiency is not a hollow issue.</p>

			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Management: Taking it from the top - Adrian Michaels on N&amp;P's unconventional approach to re-engineering ANYONE steeped in the conventional approach to re-engineering will be surprised by National &amp; Provincial Building Society's method of reorganisation. Most companies go for striking results in the first year of a re-engineering programme, concentrating on one key process, such as order-taking to delivery. The aim is almost always to slash cycle times, and sometimes also costs and staff. By contrast, N&amp;P, Britain's eighth-largest building society, has started at the top, putting the emphasis on a change in culture and organisational structure. In what amounts to a radical and risky experiment, it has so far focused mainly on 'process leadership' - getting its top managers committed and changing the way they operate - and has not yet made any change in its front line processes. The society does not even expect to finish its redesign for at least 18 months, and is cagey about the savings it will deliver. The 're-design programme' was initiated by a new management in 1990. It followed the earlier division of N&amp;P's operations into separate businesses - mortgages, life policies, and Visa cards, for example - and the establishment of a 'mission' to be in the top 15 UK personal financial service providers by 1993. David O'Brien, chief executive since August 1990, says the product focus 'left the customer in the background'. He also believes too much attention was given to acquisitions - and not enough to organic expansion through better service - and says outside consultants hired by the individual businesses pulled the organisation in different directions. The product focus also led to 'hierarchical warfare'. One of O'Brien's first appointments was Paul Chapman, as director of business and organisation development. Both had worked on re-engineering at Rank Xerox, where entrenched structures and attitudes frustrated the beginnings of a similar change. One of their first steps was a week of meetings with the heads of N&amp;P's businesses and senior corporate personnel - in all about 10 people. A new mission statement, based on meeting customer requirements while contributing to N&amp;P's prosperity, was forged and a strategy for achieving it worked out. The board was renamed the 'direction management team', and its operations reorganised into a 'direction management process'. Instead of functional and business directors, this now comprises process leaders such as directors of 'customer engagement' and 'customer requirements'. They are deeply engaged in the planning of the new business processes. Why then, more than two years later, is the vast majority of the society's 4,000 staff still working in much the same way? The reason, says Chapman, is that when the change programme is complete, eight levels of management and more than 20 grades will have become three levels and four grades, so endangering middle managers. If those managers are not convinced that robbing them of their traditional functional power - though not necessarily their jobs - is good for the future, the whole programme is jeopardised. In order to gain the support of the middle echelons, the drive for culture change began by concentrating on management seminars designed to communicate N&amp;P's thinking. Of course, this alone does not ensure that N&amp;P staff will be able to take the society where it wants to go. So the 'direction management team' has instigated a dual system of competency assessment and performance-related pay. The former is a thorough analysis of job or 'role' skills aimed at putting the right people in each process. It relies heavily on self-assessment and discussion at branch level. The point is that knowledge of colleagues' strengths enables better organisation and encourages greater productivity at all levels. Another tangible example of the culture changes is the introduction of fortnightly meetings - 'team events' - of all area staff at which updates from the top echelon are communicated. One important benefit of the meetings, according to Ann Britton, manager of the Bradford head office branch, is that the emphasis on discussion gives everyone a stake in the change process. 'There is a requirement to take part and I think the ability to keep on changing is in place.' The message that still wider change is coming seems to have hit home. Lorraine Curtin, the 23-year-old manager of the Holborn branch in London, says: 'Everyone used to be trying to get brownie points for themselves. Now it's very much teamwork. You feel part of something that's going somewhere.' Chapman says not everyone has gone along with the changes. Most of 1991 was used to call in the 150 senior managers of the society in groups of 10 to tell them about change. About 25 then left. Britton admits that the changes have been 'very, very gradual' and that life is hardly simpler. 'If I'm honest, it is that much harder.' Concrete demonstration of improved performance, though, is still frustratingly hard to come by. The society says that in the two years since 1990 its operating profit per employee increased by 60 per cent and its cost to income ratio fell from 55 per cent in 1990 to 40 per cent. But part of this cost containment might be due to the programme's main information technology expenditure not having started. When the coal-face processes are implemented, N&amp;P plans to map process systems on to computer and estimates that technology expenses will run to at least Pounds 20m. Chapman stresses that because the organisation is concentrating on the culture change, it is too early to predict eventual improvements in cycle times. But he does give an idea of the type of savings that could be made: 'The average time it takes to process a mortgage is 27 days. When underwriting decisions take place at the coal-face and the full process is put in place, the time could theoretically be 24 hours. In practice, even if this was 13 days, that would be a huge saving and a dramatic difference.' Previous articles in the series appeared on May 24, June 2, 11, 18 and 24.</p>

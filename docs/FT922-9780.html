			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: Hachette unveils FFr2.8bn rescue package HACHETTE, the troubled French publishing and media group, yesterday unveiled a FFr2.8bn (Dollars 500m) rescue plan and announced it would merge with Matra, its electronics-to-transport sister company, by the end of the year. The merger has been a long-held project of Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, who controls and manages both companies, and has always argued they would be financially stronger if united. The project, to be completed by the end of the year or early next, was hastened by Hachette's FFr3.55bn loss on La Cinq, its television station, which filed for bankruptcy last month, leaving the media group with debts of FFr8.3bn. The new group, to be called Matra-Hachette, will be quoted and have annual sales of FFr53bn spread across nine unquoted majority-owned subsidiaries. Mr Lagardere said the merger would help both its components by allowing cash to flow easily between them. Stockbroking analysts saw little industrial logic in the deal, and feared Hachette would draw on Matra's cash-flow to pay its interest bills, a suggestion strongly denied by Mr Lagardere yesterday. Daimler-Benz, the German aerospace and automotive group, and GEC, the British electronic company, which both hold 4.9 per cent stakes in Matra, had both been consulted. Their reactions were 'interested and friendly' said a senior Matra executive. Hachette's refinancing, which will take place before the Matra merger, will be handled by Mr Lagardere's main French institutional investors, the state-owned banks Banque Nationale de Paris, Credit Lyonnais and the state insurer GAN. Of the FFr2.8bn package, Hachette is to issue FFr1.3bn of perpetual subordinated paper - an equity-like instrument popular in France  - , FFr600m of convertible bonds, and FFr900m of new ordinary shares. This will reduce Hachette's debts to FFr5.8bn, said Mr Lagardere. On top of this, Hachette is planning between FFr1.3bn and FFr1.6bn of asset sales by the end of the year. It has already begun, with the FFr412m sale, announced yesterday, of a stake in Rizzoli-Corriere della Sera, the Italian publisher. Mr Lagardere said Matra was also planning to sell its stake in Ufim, a car electronics joint venture with Fiat, and was within weeks of striking an alliance in telecommunications with a 'leading world group'. Mr Lagardere will simplify the sprawl of holding companies that now exercise control over the two groups, to arrive at a simple two-step structure. MMB Holding, a quoted holding group to be headed by Mr Lagardere, will own 40 per cent of Matra-Hachette's equity capital and have 51 per cent of the voting rights. Mr Lagardere will hold around 10 per cent of MMB's shares. Although Mr Lagardere's direct stake in Matra-Hachette will be small, control will be sealed by setting up MMB Holding as a societe en commandite par actions, a practically takeover-proof partnership in which the partners have unlimited liability for corporate debts. However, stockbroking analysts believe the banks will, in practice, exert firm control over the financial management of the new group. Among other French-incorporated companies to use the commandite structure are Michelin, the tyre-maker, Yves Saint Laurent, the fashion and perfumes group and EuroDisney, the theme park operator.</p>

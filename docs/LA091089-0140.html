			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE HIGH SCHOOLS;  </P> <P> CONSCIENTIOUS RECYCLING EFFORTS PAY OFF IN KEY FIRST DOWN FOR HART  </P> <P> In terms that only a kid with an overstuffed, dog-eared football playbook can  appreciate, it is called the "recycle." It has nothing to do with melting down  aluminum beer cans and bottles, although its effect was roughly the equivalent  of being cracked over the noggin with a beer mug.  </P> <P> In Hart's 30-12 win over cross-town rival Canyon last Friday night, quarterback  Rob Westervelt and crew pulled a trick out of the Canyon repertoire and it  proved to be the game's turning point.  </P> <P> And if anything's good enough to use once, why not use it again, right?  </P> <P> With Hart leading, 14-6, on its opening drive of the third quarter, the Indian  offense stalled at the 50-yard line. Rather than punt on fourth and six,  however, first-year Coach Mike Herrington told Westervelt to run the recycle, a  variation in the volume and rhythm of the cadence that is designed to entice  the defense into jumping offside.  </P> <P> "We say 'Hut one, set, hut one, set,' over and over," Westervelt said. "We were  just gonna take the penalty if they didn't go for it."  </P> <P> The delay-of-game flag never came. Canyon jumped offside -- something its  offense has made opposing defenses do innumerable times over the years --  setting up a fourth-and-one play. The Indians liked the gimmick so much that  they used it again. Now that's recycling.  </P> <P> Canyon again jumped offside and, given new life by the ensuing first down, Hart  took a 20-6 lead when Westervelt hit tight end Chad Fotheringham with a 10-yard  scoring pass, capping a 10-play, 75-yard drive.  </P> <P> The win gave Westervelt and his senior classmates a clean sweep of sorts. The  Canyon class of 1990 never beat Hart at any level in football, and the Hart  varsity has knocked off Canyon three years in a row, which, of course, is  called threecycling.  </P> <P> Westervelt pulled an impressive recycling act of his own. In Hart's 33-28 win  last year, he completed 18 of 26 passes for 228 yards and four touchdowns.  Friday, he nearly duplicated that, hitting 18 of 24 passes for 263 yards and  three touchdowns for a two-game total of 36 completions in 50 tries for 491  yards and seven touchdowns.  </P> <P> So much for continuity: Here is one postgame footnote that Herrington would  like to change next season. Sure, Canyon has lost to Hart three years in a row,  but the Cowboys have fallen to three coaches, too: Rick Scott (1987), Dave  Carson (1988) and Herrington.  </P> <P> Flashy flashbacks: In Burroughs' 23-8 win over St. Francis, Danny Suarez took  the opening kickoff and ran it back 78 yards for an apparent touchdown.  Although it was ruled that Suarez had stepped out of bounds at the St. Francis  12-yard line, it was certainly reminiscent of the 1988 opener between the same  teams.  </P> <P> Last year, Burroughs receiver Steven Hubbell returned the opening kickoff 98  yards for a touchdown to give the Indians a 7-0 lead before most of the crowd  had taken their seats. Hubbell returned another kickoff 96 yards for a  touchdown as Burroughs won, 22-21.  </P> <P> Add flashbacks: Crespi quarterback Bill Canalez threw a pass that was  intercepted by Redlands defensive back Gary Yesionek in the Celts' 17-7 loss,  but he can at least take solace in the fact that he is still two up on his  predecessor, Ron Redell, now at Stanford.  </P> <P> In last season's 28-6 loss to Redlands, Yesionek intercepted three Redell  passes.  </P> <P> Flying high again: Saugus' 30-12 win over South Pasadena marked the first time  that the Centurions have reached the 30-point plateau in 13 games, dating a  37-22 win over Ridgecrest Burroughs in 1987.  </P> <P> Saugus junior Jeff Hickman, who took over at quarterback two weeks ago when  starter Rob Weeg left the team because of personal reasons, passed for 131  yards and one touchdown.  </P> <P> Crossing the black-and-blue line: Last season, Chatsworth Coach Myron Gibford  was faced with a decision -- go with sophomore Tyler Johnston and build for the  future, or try a short-term fix and use an older starter at quarterback.  </P> <P> Gibford chose Johnston and, statistically, he wound up the worst quarterback in  the North Valley League, completing just 35 of 100 passes for no touchdowns and  throwing 14 interceptions. Building for the future has its risks.  </P> <P> "I used him because I thought he'd be back," Gibford said.  </P> <P> Guess again. Johnston is now attending a prep school in Minnesota -- after  receiving a hockey scholarship.  </P> <P> "I guess that was his real first love," Gibford said.  </P> <P> Orlando of Florida returns: Todd Orlando, who played on the varsity basketball  team at El Camino Real High as a sophomore but missed last season after moving  to Florida to live with his father, is expected back at El Camino Real when  school opens Tuesday, according to Coach Mike McNulty.  </P> <P> Orlando, a 6-foot senior guard, has the kind of perimeter shot that could have  put the Conquistadores over the top last season. El Camino Real advanced to the  City Section 3-A semifinals before losing to eventual champion Fremont.  </P> <P> "He's a very good outside shooter," said McNulty, who lost his starting guard  tandem of Russell Reid and Jason Farrell to graduation.  </P> <P> Former El Camino Real assistant Jeff Davis, now coach at West Valley League  rival Canoga Park, says Orlando probably makes El Camino Real the team to beat  in league play.  </P> <P> "Todd has the ability to be a fantastic player," Davis said. "When he's on, he  can just shoot the lights out. He could be the difference."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  said Wednesday [1 June] the government will map out a plan for  administration reforms by the end of this month, government  officials said.    Hata made the remarks at a meeting with members of the Tax  Commission, an advisory body for the prime minister that has  been examining ways of reforming Japan's taxation systems.    Kan Kato, the head of the commission, told Hata that in  order  to carry out tax reforms, administration reforms should come  first so as to show efforts of reducing government expenses to  the people, they said.    Hata replied that the government will draw up a plan for  administration reforms by the end of June, before the Tax  Commission is expected to compile a tax reform plan, according  to the officials. They quoted Hata as saying, in administration  reforms, that there will be no "sanctuary" areas. The officials  said Hata also promised to consider drawing up a five-year plan  for national and regional governments' administration,  responding to a call by Kato for such a plan.    On the recently shelved plans for raising public charges,  Hata told the Tax Commission members that he did not mean to  simply postpone such hikes, according to the officials.  Instead, he will instruct concerned government sectors to  review public service systems and charges, Hata was quoted as  saying.</p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / UK Company News: Capital Radio expansion Capital Radio, the London commercial pop music broadcaster, has extended its reach to the south of England with an agreed Pounds 32.6m takeover of Southern Radio. The boost to the process of consolidation within the commercial radio industry came the day after Capital's London rival LBC announced it had gone into receivership. Capital, the flagship company of commercial radio whose two London licences, Capital FM and Capital Gold, will soon be up for renewal has already received irrevocable undertakings covering 55.9 per cent of the Southern shares. The deal is 115p in cash for each share of Southern, a group formed in 1991 by the merger of Invicta Sound and Southern Radio. The group broadcasts in Kent, Sussex, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. The deal will reinforce Capital's position as the main player in the UK industry. Apart from its two London licences the company also operates BRMB and Xtra AM in Birmingham and has stakes in a string of other radio companies including GWR, Metro Radio and Chilton. The bid for Southern, which returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 956,000 on turnover of Pounds 8.6m in the year to September, is designed to increase Capital's business outside London where competition continues to grow. The Radio Authority is about to advertise four new radio licences for London and further licences are possible next year. Commercial radio revenues in the UK have been rising, helped by two new national stations - Classic FM and Virgin 1215 - launched in Britain and a raft of more local stations and a better co-ordinated promotional campaign for radio.</p>

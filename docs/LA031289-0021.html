			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRAT PACK IN MOSCOW  </P> <P> It was clear that the political orientations that the "brat pack" held were  altered by just a couple of weeks in the U.S.S.R. Such shallowness reinforces  the flighty, uncommitted image of affluent child actors. It is unfortunate that  their influence will always outweigh their merit. But since they enjoy kissing  airport Tarmac, I suggest they spend a couple of weeks in Rangoon, Jakarta or  Calcutta (to see how most of the world lives) and then fly to Moscow. I am sure  they will find socialist Tarmac a similar flavor to our American variety.  </P> <P> DONALD JOHNSTON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

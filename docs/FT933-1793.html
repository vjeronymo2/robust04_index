			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Paramount One has to hope that Paramount's attraction does not turn out to be fatal. QVC Network's emergence as a rival suitor to Viacom comes as no surprise. But the price it is offering, at something approaching 20 times this year's cash-flow, looks an almost indecent proposal. It is easy to see why such companies are seduced by the idea of owning a studio. Paramount's film-making skills cannot easily be duplicated. There is nothing similar on the market. Yet conventional wisdom dictates that anyone who aspires to success in the global media business must have the capacity to originate entertainment. The temptation for predators to lose sight of real value is all the greater when they can pay with overvalued currency in the form of their own common stock. Viacom's offer is already worth a lot less than the original Dollars 8.2bn. QVC's shares also look vulnerable. Perhaps the willingness of such companies to splash their paper about is a sign that equity prices really have reached fantasy levels. Certainly they would be much less inclined to largesse if they were having to stump up real money. That will not stop the Paramount story turning into a long-running epic. Viacom may offer a better strategic fit than QVC, but it will have to increase the cash element of its bid, currently Dollars 9.10 compared with QVC's Dollars 30, to remain in the running. Even then others may enter the fray. It would be rash, though, to count on a foreign bidder sailing in with a ship load of cash. Growing protectionism in the media business on both sides of the Atlantic makes such a raid fraught with danger.</p>

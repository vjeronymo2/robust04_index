			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Bullers confirms cash call Bullers, the giftware and media group, yesterday confirmed its intimated rights issue and announced a reduced first-half loss of Pounds 402,000. It is seeking to raise Pounds 1.26m via the issue of 7.02m shares at 20p on a 1-for-7 basis. The group, which underwent a capital reconstruction in March, said yesterday that all but one of its subsidiaries were trading profitably. The proceeds are intended to eliminate the overdraft and short-term borrowings, which amount to about Pounds 523,000, and for working capital. In the six months to June 30 the pre-tax loss was reduced by Pounds 599,000. Sales of Pounds 1.73m (Pounds 1.11m) included Pounds 711,000 from acquisitions. Clashfleet, acquired in March, forms the media division, which contributed operating profits of Pounds 51,000 on sales of Pounds 430,000. Losses per share were 1.5p (0.88p).</p>

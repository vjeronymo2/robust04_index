			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: APV falls to Pounds 13m but upbeat about prospects APV, which supplies processing equipment to the food and drink industries, reported another drop in annual profits but was upbeat over the progress of its extensive restructuring programme. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 20.2m to Pounds 13.4m in the year to December 31. Sales from continuing operations rose by 3 per cent to Pounds 834m, although exchange rate changes inflated the figure by Pounds 70m. Sir Peter Cazalet, chairman, said: 'Significant progress has been made during 1993 in positioning the group for growth and a return to acceptable levels of profitability.' Despite the difficult economic environment, the chairman said APV was achieving good orders in a number of its chosen markets and overall, the order book was 10 per cent ahead of last year. He added: 'Our trading and financial position is stronger and I feel more confident about the group's prospects now than at any time in the past four years.' APV said it had responded to difficult conditions by continuing to rationalise capacity, improve efficiency, divest non-core businesses and focus on identified target markets. Mr Clive Strowger, chief executive, said 10 plants had been closed or were closing and the workforce had been reduced by 2,500 to below 10,000 since 1992, the year he was appointed. Economic conditions in the US improved during the year and there were some signs of recovery in the UK. Recessionary conditions prevailed throughout continental Europe, although Asian economies continued to grow strongly, apart from Japan. APV expected no significant improvement in the economic environment in continental Europe, which accounts for approximately 40 per cent of the group's orders and sales, during 1994. Gearing fell from 31 per cent to 7.5 per cent. Earnings per share fell to 0.9p (3p) but the final dividend is being held at 3.4p giving a maintained 5.4p total. COMMENT Analysts found the results a mixed bag, with further rationalisation costs partly offset by an unexpected gain on an interest swap deal. However, the management has taken a cautious line on accounting standards. Most interest focused on the positive note struck concerning orders and future prospects, given the scale of recent surgery on the sprawling portfolio which Mr Strowger inherited. The scale of the cost-cutting should make APV highly geared to any volume increase. Forecast profits of up to Pounds 25m put the shares, down 7p at 121 1/2 p, on a prospective multiple of 25, which clearly puts them in the recovery bracket. But few such stocks are underpinned by a prospective yield of 5.4 per cent and can already point to a 10 per cent in rise in orders - even although its main market is still flat on its back.</p>

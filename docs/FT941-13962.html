			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading The expiry of the index options was the day's main feature in the derivatives sector leading to strong volumes in both the index futures and traded options, writes Joel Kibazo. Trading in the March futures contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 3,486 and promptly went into retreat as independent traders sold stock The release of favourable GDP figures prompted strong buying of March, said to have been led by UBS and Monument. A large part of the demand was due to technical reasons ahead of the mid-morning expiry of the Index options and it sent March crashing through the 3,500 barrier to peak at 3,517 March drifted for the rest of the session and finished at 3,490 on hefty volume of 20,421 contracts. Unwinding of positions as the index options expired brought closing turnover of 52,913 contracts of which 20,165 was dealt in the FT-SE 100 option, and 13,603 in the Euro FT-SE 100.</p>

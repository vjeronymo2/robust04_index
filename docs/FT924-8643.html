			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Betterware leaps to Pounds 6.3m in first half WHILE UK shoppers remain tight-fisted in the high street, Betterware has discovered a way to unlock spending from the home. The door-to-door distributor of household goods more than doubled pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.81m to Pounds 6.3m, on turnover of Pounds 29.4m, in the 28 weeks to September 12. Sales in the home shopping division went up Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 23m, with operating profit showing a sharp improvement to Pounds 5.85m. Mr Andrew Cohen, chief executive, said the group was filling a gap left by the hardware shops that had disappeared over recent years. Although superstores offered household goods, the items tended to get lost on their shelves. Betterware increased its street-by-street penetration, helped by a sophisticated computerised mapping system, as its army of self-employed sales people grew from 7,000 to 9,000. Mr Cohen, whose family owns 60 per cent of the company, said the average amount each customer spent at a time had increased from Pounds 7 to more than Pounds 8, reversing a downward trend from Pounds 9 three years ago. He attributed this to a larger catalogue that improved presentation of the 411 products. With fixed costs kept down - the company only employs 180 people directly and suppliers hold most of the stock - a good proportion of additional turnover filtered down to the bottom line. Economies of scale also assisted as the print run for catalogues rose from 9m to 13m and buying power improved for raw materials. Its recently acquired French operation, accounting for less than 2 per cent of sales, was expected to move into profit in the second half. The group nearly doubled net cash to Pounds 8.8m during the half-year, with the help of a deferred payment for land. Interest received trebled to Pounds 301,000. It plans to invest Pounds 9m in a new distribution centre over the next two years. Betterware's other division, a miscellany of consumer products manufacture and coffee shops, suffered from recession, with operating profit sliding from Pounds 302,000 to Pounds 140,000 on flat sales of Pounds 6.4m. Earnings per share rose from 1.95p to 4.29p. The interim dividend is increased from 0.34p to 0.5p. COMMENT Betterware's trend-trouncing performance added another 4p to its share price, driving it to a new high of 172p. Its market value has multiplied more than six times in the past two years to Pounds 175m. A prospective p/e of 21, on its broker Smith New Court's full-year prognosis of Pounds 12.5m, gives the company a well-deserved premium. The momentum built up in the UK market and first fruits from France lie behind a forecast that profits will gain another third next year. Looking ahead, Mr Cohen remains eloquent on the subject of intensifying coverage of the UK, but diminishing returns must set in. Then success in transferring the formula abroad will be crucial and the jury has not even left the court on that one. With Betterware sporting a Cadburyesque interim statement, complete with cash flow statement and accountants' review, it is all dressed up to face scrutiny from retail analysts as it graduates from small company status. Potential buyers should wait to see what a fresh set of critics make of it.</p>

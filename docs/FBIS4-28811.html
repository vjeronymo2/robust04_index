			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- Japan and the European  Union (EU) on Tuesday [14 June] agreed to cooperate further in  enhancing each other's industrial foundation, Japanese Trade  Ministry officials said.    At the end of the second "Japan-EU Industrial Policy and  Cooperation Dialogue" in Tokyo, Japan's Ministry of  International Trade and Industry (MITI) and the European  Commission issued a joint statement calling for industrial  cooperation not only in existing areas such as electric home  appliances but in new sectors like computers, auto parts and  office equipment, the officials said.    The statement said both parties will also support dialogue  between Japanese and EU business leaders to be held by the end  of this year under the newly established "roundtable." Under  the manufacturing technology fellowship program, young European  engineers will be invited to work in Japanese plants for up to  one year, the statement said.    The MITI officials said Japan and the EU confirmed the  importance of further action in existing cooperative areas,  among them the training of European engineers through the  Industrial Cooperation Center (ICC). The ICC was created in  Tokyo in 1987 as a way to get European companies accustomed to  Japanese business practices and market conditions.    Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice MITI minister for international  affairs, led a Japanese team at Tuesday's meeting while the  European side was headed by Riccardo Perissich, chief of the  European Commission's Industry Bureau [name and title as  received].</p>

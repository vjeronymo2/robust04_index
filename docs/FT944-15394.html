			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Swedish budget deficit set to widen The fragile state of Sweden's economy was underscored yesterday when the government announced a much bigger than expected budget deficit, threatening growth prospects. The central bank also warned that price rise expectations in 1995 exceeded its target ceiling of 3 per cent inflation. The finance ministry said the budget deficit in the current 1994-95 fiscal year would be SKr201bn (Pounds 17.3bn), well above the SKr150bn previously forecast and likely to be around last year's record equivalent of 13 per cent of gross national product. The ministry blamed increased borrowing costs. Mr Goran Persson, the new Social Democratic finance minister, said more cuts in public spending were now probable in January's budget beyond those already being implemented and the fiscal measures he was due to introduce early next month. Next month's package would reflect his plan outlined during the campaign for last month's general election for spending cuts and tax increases to strengthen the budget by SKr61bn over four years. Mr Persson acknowledged the threat which the crisis in the public finances now poses to Sweden's slow recovery from three years of recession. He said a new round of spending cuts in January would have a negative effect on growth. Already, earlier forecasts of 3 per cent GNP growth in 1995 have been downgraded to 2 per cent or less. To add to his difficulties, the Riksbank said yesterday that inflationary pressure was on the rise because of increasing producer prices - prompted by the heavy fall in the value of the krona last year - and historically high levels of capacity utilisation in industry. It issued an implicit warning that short-term interest rates might have to rise to check inflation unless the government restored market confidence in the public finances.</p>

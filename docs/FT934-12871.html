			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Japan fumbles for a nuclear stance: Russian waste dumping highlights an uneasy internal debate AN anxious crowd gathered one evening last week on a pavement in central Tokyo beneath a giant television screen on the wall of a tower block. Home-bound commuters had stopped to watch a news film of a rusty Russian navy tanker wallowing in the sea off northern Japan, as it pumped liquid nuclear waste into the water. The commuters were not the only ones to be worried by the dumping, denounced as 'deplorable' by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the foreign minister. The issue has dominated newspaper and television coverage for much of last week and outraged the environmentally sensitive, fish-eating Japanese. This is not the first time the issue has arisen. Last March the Russian navy admitted it had routinely dumped nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan. It was 'unbelievable' and a 'disgrace', Japanese government leaders said at the time. In the end, last week, Moscow was persuaded to cancel plans to dump a second load of waste - low-level coolant and cleansing water from decommissioned nuclear submarines - after a phone call from Mr Hata to his Russian counterpart, Mr Andrei Kozyrev. Japanese Foreign Ministry officials correctly guessed that the dumping was as much of a surprise to Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who only a week before had been in Tokyo on an official fence-mending visit, as it was to them. In return for Russia's co-operation, Japan will consider giving financial help for nuclear waste disposal on Russian territory. Yet like many environmental rows, this one is more complex than it seems. For a start, the radioactivity of the liquid dumped last week appears to be weak, and the International Atomic Energy Agency was informed in advance. The Russians claim they were acting within international guidelines, even if outside a voluntary international moratorium on dumping nuclear material at sea. A Japanese research vessel has been dispatched to the scene to check. Whatever the truth, the row highlights an uncomfortable internal Japanese debate about how the country should develop its own nuclear industry. Governments have struggled, not always successfully, to balance the need to reduce Japan's present complete dependence on energy imports, with the imperative of satisfying environmental concerns. Like Russia, Japan has a nuclear problem, even if it is of a different order. There is a parallel, for instance, between the row over Russian dumping and the international outcry that greeted last year's shipment of 1.7 tonnes of plutonium fuel from a reprocessing plant in northern France to a port near Tokyo. The protests from countries along the route, alarmed by Japan's fumbled attempts to keep the cargo secret, have prompted the government to review its plutonium policy. Yet Japan needs the fuel, supposed to be the first of 30 such shipments, for use in a fast-breeder reactor under development. Japan hopes it will no longer have to use French reprocessing in 10 years, when its own reprocessing plant is completed. But until then, Japan faces the same dilemma every time it needs a load of reprocessed plutonium. In another parallel with Russia, Japan once had a bad environmental record, a cost of its fast post-war industrial growth. This started to become unacceptable in the late 1950s, when mercury pollution in the sea off the southern coast led to deformed children and adult diseases in Minamata, a fishing town. Even today Japanese courts are working through the queue of Minamata compensation suits, providing the public with repeated reminders of Japan's polluted past. It is no surprise, then, that Russian waste dumping has given the Japanese government a few uncomfortable moments.</p>

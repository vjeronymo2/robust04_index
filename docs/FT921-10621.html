			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Most Tory MPs want tax cuts in Budget AN overwhelming majority of Conservative MPs wants Mr Norman Lamont to give priority to tax cuts in any pre-election boost to the economy in his Budget on March 10. An FT survey of opinion among the government's supporters at Westminster shows that those favouring tax cuts outnumber by more than three to one those who would prefer a stimulus to come from higher public spending. The results - gathered from detailed questionnaires returned by 107, or nearly a third, of Conservative MPs - come amid widespread acknowledgement in Whitehall that the economy's emergence from recession has been further delayed. Senior officials acknowledged yesterday that the Treasury was revising down its growth forecasts in the approach to the Budget as the recession provoked another fierce House of Commons row between Mr John Major and Mr Neil Kinnock. Mr Kinnock accused Mr Major of being responsible for the longest recession since the 1930s, while the prime minister hit back by accusing the Labour leader of 'economic illiteracy'. The officials acknowledged that slower growth would mean a higher public sector borrowing requirement, but said it would also strengthen the case for use of the 'fiscal stabilisers' which would allow a higher budget deficit. That is the traditional Whitehall code to indicate there should still be room for tax cuts. The FT poll coincides with an intense debate among senior ministers on whether the chancellor should make a cut from 25p to 24p in the basic rate of income tax the centrepiece of next month's Budget. The growing number in favour argue that since Labour is pledged to reverse such a reduction it would provide the Conservatives an ideal platform for an April 9 election. That argument will be strengthened by the majority of backbench MPs shown by the survey to view lower income taxes as essential to secure the government's re-election. Some 71 per cent of the MPs said they would prefer income tax cuts over any increase in public spending. Last night the backbenchers were putting that view to Mr Lamont and his Treasury team at a Westminster meeting. Of those saying tax cuts should be the priority, a small majority - 52 per cent against 43 per cent - said they would prefer an increase in the thresholds at which people begin to pay tax rather than a lower basic rate. But that difference is small enough to ensure that whichever course Mr Lamont adopted would win the strong backing of the Tory party at Westminster. A majority of respondents to the survey also want the chancellor to introduce measures to increase investment. In addition, there are strong lobbies urging the chancellor to boost their chances in the election by extending tax relief for working mothers and by announcing reductions in inheritance and capital gains taxes. The survey shows that more than 60 per cent rate Mr Lamont's performance as excellent or good. Poll details, Page 10</p>

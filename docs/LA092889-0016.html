			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COORDINATING COASTLINE ACTIVITY  </P> <P> Considering Gov. George Deukmejian's consistent and persistent hostility to the  California Coastal Commission, it was not surprising that he vetoed a bill that  would have empowered the commission to halt illegal bulldozing of roads and  grading of development sites, and to fine those who ignored such stop-work  orders. Regrettable, but not surprising.  </P> <P> The governor still has an opportunity, however, to approve legislation that  might provide marginal improvement in administering state laws affecting the  coastline and offshore regions, although it does not grant any new authority to  any state agency. The measure is AB 2000 sponsored by Assemblyman Sam Farr  (D-Carmel). Farr's proposed California Ocean Resources Management Act of 1990  would establish an Ocean Resources Task Force representing the more than 20  state agencies that regulate, oversee, study, protect and lease the ocean  resources -- activities that also affect the coastal area upland of the  high-tide line.  </P> <P> The idea is to make sure that each of the state departments knows what the  others are doing and that they provide consistent state policy in management of  the ocean resources. The taskforce also would try to work with the federal  government to make certain federal agencies follow state laws where applicable.  The task force would report to the governor and Legislature on Jan. 1, 1993, on  ways to improve such management and coordination. The task force would serve as  a clearinghouse for all the information and research being compiled by the  state agencies.  </P> <P> While it may seem a simple matter, one arm of state government does not always  know just what another branch is doing, even though both might deal with  essentially the same subjects. The task force would provide the necessary  coordination. The bill deserves the governor's signature.  </P> <P> As for the pirate bulldozers, the Legislature should try again to construct a  bill that is acceptable to the governor. Illegal grading and road construction  has been a particular problem in the Santa Monica Mountains and along the  Malibu coast. When the Coastal Commission learns of a violation, it must ask  the state attorney general to persuade a judge to issue a temporary restraining  order. This process often takes a week and, by then, the damage is done. The  vetoed bill was sponsored by Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia).  </P></p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / International Company News: TNT in freight deal with Federal Express TNT Express Worldwide, the express delivery arm of the Australian freight group, announced yesterday it had established a 'linehaul' agreement for Transatlantic freight with Memphis-based Federal Express. There has been speculation recently about possible links between the two companies. Federal Express has been losing money on its European operations and confirmed last week it was looking to restructure its international business. Analysts have speculated this could involve joint venture arrangements, and TNT's name has been touted as a possible partner. TNT said the announcement had been made partly in response to queries arising from press speculation. But, neither TNT nor Federal Express would state if this was the full extent of talks between them. TNT said the agreement was a 'routine commercial decision', and Federal Express claimed it was similar to deals with other freight forwarders. TNT will transport express freight from Cologne, where it has a 'hub' operation, to Stansted in the UK. There it will be loaded on a daily Federal Express DC-10 and flown to JFK Airport, New York. A similar arrangement will operate eastbound.</p>

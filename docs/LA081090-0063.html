			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 567 HOSPITALS SUE STATE, ALLEGING SERIOUS MEDI-CAL UNDERPAYMENTS  </P> <P> Accusing the state of neglecting the needy, California's hospitals have joined  together in a lawsuit against the state Department of Health Services to obtain  bigger Medi-Cal payments and revive a health-care system that they say is  edging toward collapse.  </P> <P> The unprecedented suit, announced Thursday, was brought on behalf of  California's 567 hospitals, which contend that the state has illegally  underpaid them millions of dollars to treat indigent outpatients under the  Medi-Cal program.  </P> <P> As a result, the hospitals say, the financial strain has forced them to scale  back or stop providing poor adults and their children with a variety of  non-emergency procedures, including neonatal care, rehabilitative therapy and  diagnostic medical exams.  </P> <P> The hospitals also contend that the state's failure to shoulder a greater  percentage of the costs for indigent care has endangered patients who are not  poor by prompting the closure of trauma centers and emergency rooms throughout  the state.  </P> <P> At a press conference Thursday, hospital representatives blamed the shortfalls  on Gov. George Deukmejian's Administration, arguing that the governor  traditionally has axed benefits for the disadvantaged to balance the state's  budget.  </P> <P> "It's a sad day for hospitals that we have to sue the state to ensure adequate  medical care for poor people in California. . . . Poor people should have  access to the same kind of health care as the rest of us," said C. Daune  Dauner, president of the California Assn. of Hospitals and Health Systems,  which filed the lawsuit in conjunction with Los Angeles' Orthopaedic Hospital.  </P> <P> "We are in a vice and it is being squeezed to a point where our very existence  is being threatened," he said, adding that California hospitals are losing more  than $575,000 a day treating Medi-Cal outpatients.  </P> <P> "We are at our wit's end," agreed Steve Gamble, president of the Hospital  Council of Southern California. "We don't want to sue the state (but) it has  left us with no other choice."  </P> <P> In recent months, Medi-Cal funding has emerged as a major issue in Sacramento  and across the state as complaints have flooded in from nursing homes, doctors  and AIDS activists, all of whom contend that the program is failing to meet the  needs of its intended recipients. Patients dependent on Medi-Cal have begun  crowding into public hospitals, straining resources from such programs as  obstetrics.  </P> <P> On Thursday, hospital officials described their unusual lawsuit as "a last  resort." The suit was the first filed in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court  ruling involving a similar situation in Virginia. The court ruled that the  medical association there could sue the state. Although the governor's office  had no immediate comment on the litigation, a Deukmejian spokeswoman said the  governor has tried to justly distribute budget cuts.  </P> <P> "Every special interest that didn't receive the amount they felt they were  entitled to blames the governor," spokeswoman Anita MacKenzie said. "The budget  has been balanced on the backs of each and everyone of them, according to  them."  </P> <P> A spokesman for the Department of Health Services said his agency is also  withholding comment until it reviews the legal papers filed Wednesday in  federal District Court in Los Angeles, which name the agency's director,  Kenneth Kizer, as a plaintiff.  </P> <P> But the spokesman insisted that "California is doing the best it can, given the  budget limitations that exist today and the growing number of indigent people  who are availing themselves of Medi-Cal services. I suppose it is always going  to be true that there is never going to be enough money."  </P> <P> At the heart of the lawsuit is a contention by the hospitals that the state is  violating federal Medicaid laws requiring reimbursement rates to be based on  such "relevant factors" as the hospitals' costs of providing services and the  quality of care.  </P> <P> Instead, the lawsuit contends, the state has primarily based its repayment  policy on "budgetary constraints," ignoring other federally mandated factors.  And for that reason, the lawsuit argues, the court should invalidate the  current payment rates and compel the Department of Health Services to set new  ones.  </P> <P> "California has violated the law far too long," the hospital association's  Dauner said in a statement.  </P> <P> Among the 50 states, he said, California now ranks 47th in per-capita  government spending for indigent patients. Since 1982, he said, the state has  hiked overall payment rates to hospitals by only 2%, while hospital costs have  soared 50% during the same period. He said hospitals today receive 55 cents on  every dollar they spend for providing care under the Medi-Cal program.  </P> <P> David Langness of the Hospital Council of Southern California puts the blame  squarely on Deukmejian. He said he recalls the governor remarking during his  1986 budget message that "he believed we had a Cadillac of a medical program  and he was going to scale it back to a Chevrolet.  </P> <P> "Basically," Langness said, "he drove the Chevrolet into a wall and turned it  into an old Ford Pinto."  </P></p>

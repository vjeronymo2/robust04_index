			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE HUMAN COSTS OF WAR  </P> <P> Would the United States send troops to defend a country where women are classed  as equal to cattle and horses; where teen vandals often are punished by  severing their fingers; where Christians are seldom trusted and Jews are hated;  where democracy is a dirty word? The country I refer to is Saudi Arabia. Of  course, Iraq is guilty of these human-rights transgressions and much more.  </P> <P> JOE HOFERR  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Thailand reformers suffer setback Thailand's government suffered a humiliating defeat in parliament yesterday when right-wing opposition parties and the military-dominated senate threw out its plans to reform the constitution and make the political system more democratic. The defeat raised questions about the ability of Mr Chuan Leekpai, the prime minister, to hold together his five-party coalition. The government was elected in 1992 with a mandate to strengthen democracy, after 50 people were killed in an uprising that overthrew a pro-military government. Among those who voted against Mr Chuan's government, in a joint session of the lower house and senate, were Gen Wimol Wongwanich, army commander-in-chief, and Mr Vijit Sookmark, defence minister. A government spokesman described the defeat as 'a bad situation'. Dealers on the Thai stock exchange marked down share prices for the third day running. The SET index fell 7.46 points yesterday to close at 1,232.53. But Mr Chuan insisted that parliament would not be dissolved. 'There have been attempts to topple my government by the group of people who want to return to power,' he told reporters. The senators, who were appointed by a military junta after a coup d'etat in 1991, joined with opposition members of parliament to push through their own, hastily prepared, batch of constitutional amendments while blocking the government's version. Senators were particularly incensed by the government's plan to make the senate more accountable and reduce the number of its members to 120 from 270. The government wanted - among its other, less controversial, amendments  -to lower the national voting age from 20 to 18. The counter-proposals drawn up by the opposition alliance are regarded by most Thais as a way to undermine the government rather than a serious attempt to reform the constitution. Pro-democracy activists who joined the uprising against the armed forces in 1992 are now in confusion. They oppose attempts by the armed forces and their allies to increase their influence but are also frustrated by Mr Chuan's slow progress. He is accused, among other shortcomings, of failing to solve Bangkok's traffic problems. During 1992, the Thai media divided Thai politicians into pro-democracy 'angels', such as Mr Chuan, and pro-military 'Satans'. But Mr Sukhumbhand Paribatra, a prominent academic and political commentator, said after the government's defeat this week that parliament should be dissolved and new elections held. He remarked: 'Now all MPs are Satans.'</p>

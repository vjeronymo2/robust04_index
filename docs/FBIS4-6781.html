			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 24 (KCNA) -- The traitorous Kim  Yong-sam clique on April 22 announced a plan of "Hwarang" war  exercises involving the puppet Army, police and "homeland  reserve force", more than 1.3 million strong, according to a  radio report from Seoul.    The 5-day exercises will begin on April 25 with Inchon and  Kyonggi Province adjacent to the Military Demarcation Line as  the theatre.    The facts clearly prove once again that the traitorous Kim  Yong-sam clique is trying to find a way out of the crisis in the  provocation of a war against the North, following in the  footsteps of the preceding military fascist dictators. The fact  that the plan of a massive war game was declared right after the  powder-reeking trip to Seoul of the U.S. defense secretary fully  reveals that the criminal tour was aimed at egging the puppet  clique on to provoke another war against the North.</p>

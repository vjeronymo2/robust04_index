They remain 12-3 in  the Pacific 10.  </P> <P> Duke guard Phil Henderson scored 28 points to lead the Blue Devils. He was  coming off a four-for-18 shooting performance in Duke's 76-71 loss to North  Carolina State last Wednesday. He hit 12 of 20 shots Sunday, and had 18 points  in the second half.  </P> <P> Arizona held a 70-69 edge with 3:43 left, but four consecutive free throws in a  23-second span by Christian Laettner put Duke ahead for good.  </P> <P> Henderson sank two free throws to make it 77-74 with 22 seconds left.  </P> <P> Arizona got within two on a layup by Sean Rooks at the buzzer.  </P> <P> Abdelnaby scored 17 points before fouling out for Duke (23-5). The Blue Devils  won their 56th consecutive nonconference game at home.  </P> <P> For Arizona, Brian Williams had 19 points, Buechler scored 17, Rooks had 15 and  Ed Stokes 13.  </P> <P> Stanford 57, Arizona St. 44 -- Deshon Wingate scored 17 points and Adam Keefe  added 16 to lead the Cardinal (16-9, 8-8) to a Pac-10 victory at Stanford.  </P> <P> Arizona State (12-13, 5-10) made only seven of 22 shots in the first half to  trail, 22-16.  </P> <P> The 44 points is the fewest by a Stanford opponent this season. No Sun Devil  had more than 12 points.  </P></p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (5): The night the City almost died - Finance THE CEDAR STORY: THE NIGHT THE CITY WAS SAVED by Charles Gordon Sinclair-Stephenson Pounds 18.99, 326 pages ALMOST everybody has now forgotten the collapse 20 years ago of Cedar Holdings, an obscure second mortgage company. But not Charles Gordon, a well-connected one-time journalist turned minor financier who is the author of this elegantly written, if distinctly self-indulgent, history of a secondary bank which crashed on the dramatic night of Wednesday, December 19, 1973. Whether a participant in a drama should write the history is a moot point. Certainly there is an overdose of score-settling here by the author, who was closely involved in setting up Cedar in the 1960s for the Morrison family, one-time dress shop proprietors who wanted to move into the more glamorous worlds of property and banking. Charles Gordon fixed them up with respectable institutional partners such as the Unilever pension fund and Phoenix Assurance but he was pushed off the board in 1971. Jack Morrison's 'detestable' nephew assumed a leading role, and the company began to tap the short-term money markets in order to finance expansion. Then the family, disastrously for them as it was to turn out, merged their property company Amalgamated Securities into Cedar, mainly in order to gain family voting control of the combined enterprise. The top executives were just trying out their brand new Hawker Siddeley 125/600B corporate jet when the secondary banking crisis struck. With unbelievable suddenness the family fortune was lost. According to Gordon's account, the Morrisons failed to understand the risks of one of Britain's regular credit bubbles. But as the reader wades through pages of name-dropping, of accounts of irrelevant French Riviera parties, and of remarks such as 'my driver was waiting patiently outside Wilton's', a different conclusion emerges: that the shortsighted Gordon designed a cultural clash into Cedar, and even an ethnic one, because this was very much the story of upstart Jewish businessmen colliding with establishment institutions. Much later, in the 1980s, the collision was to be echoed when the Bank of England clashed awkwardly with the Pakistani-controlled BCCI. So to that awful night at the Bank of England in late 1973, when the fact that the Jewish Morrisons were served with ham sandwiches was the least of their problems. Although not himself a participant at this final stage of the story, Charles Gordon has crafted an entertaining reconstruction. For the sake of the financial system it was declared by the Bank that Cedar had to open its doors the next day; but the institutions, in exchange for their willingness to replace the money extracted by stampeding depositors, stripped the company of its property assets and closed it for new lending business. In the end the deal only went through, after 1 am, because the family was in a minority on the board. The City was saved; Jack Morrison was broken, and died four years later worth Pounds 6,500. Reading at times like a kind of Pseud's Guide to the Barber property boom, the book is liberally peppered with flattery and putdowns: Stash Radziwill was 'the quintessential European aristocrat' but Kenneth Cork, the liquidator, spoke in an 'upper-class cockney accent'. There is much, much more about people than about Cedar Holdings, but perhaps that is as it should be.</p>

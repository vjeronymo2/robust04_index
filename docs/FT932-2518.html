			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): PCs get into the swim of things Many a worried dentist's patient has been soothed by the fish in the tank. Now a Moscow-based software company, Animatek, has developed a package to enable frustrated PC owners to create their own fish tanks. El-Fish, distributed in the UK by Mindscape International, was developed by a team of Russian mathematicians headed by Alexey Pajitnov. Users can create their ideal fish by interbreeding from the 'menu' of pictures on the screen. Then they create the tank, select the accompanying music and set the fish swimming.

			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUNSET LEAGUE;  </P> <P> EDISON STILL HOLDING HUNTINGTON BEACH AT BAY WITH 16-10 WIN  </P> <P> Edison High School continued its domination of the Huntington Beach football  team Thursday night, but just barely.  </P> <P> Edison's Josh Gingrich threw an eight-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Ryan  Blanchard with 8 minutes 31 seconds left to play and the Chargers held on for a  16-10 victory in a Sunset League game at LeBard Stadium.  </P> <P> It was the 14th time in the past 15 years Edison has beaten Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> More importantly, it gave the Chargers, ranked sixth in Orange County, an early  lead in the league race. The Chargers improved to 3-1 overall and 1-0 in league  play while Huntington Beach, ranked fifth in the county, dropped to 3-1 and  0-1.  </P> <P> Gingrich completed four of five passes for 27 yards on the winning drive. He  completed 17 of 35 passes overall for 157 yards with two touchdowns and three  interceptions.  </P> <P> "Josh got hot a little bit in the fourth quarter when we needed him to," Edison  Coach Dave White said.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach got the ball back three times in the final eight minutes, but  failed to score.  </P> <P> Edison linebacker Mike Hawks ended the final threat with 52 seconds left when  he intercepted a pass by Huntington Beach's Jack Friend at the Edison 31-yard  line.  </P> <P> "We didn't throw the ball well at all," Huntington Beach Coach George Pascoe  said. "Our penalties (eight for 100 yards) were horrible."  </P> <P> Edison kept the pressure on Friend the entire game, sacking him three times for  minus-26 yards. Friend completed three of 14 passes for 19 yards and three  interceptions.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach tailback Joe Contreras rushed for 109 yards in 14 carries, but  had only two carries for 21 yards in the second half.  </P> <P> "Contreras is really quick," White said. "He bounced a couple (of runs) on us."  </P> <P> Contreras kept the Oilers moving in the first half as the teams battled to a  10-10 halftime tie.  </P> <P> Edison's first-half scoring came on a safety and a nine-yard touchdown pass  from Gingrich to Travis Balding. Gingrich then threw a two-point conversion  pass to Rod Lippincott.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach's first-half scoring came on a 24-yard field goal by Alex  Acocello and a four-yard run by Adam Bowermaster, who also intercepted two  passes.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach had a chance to break the tie with 35 seconds left in the  third quarter, but Acocello's 35-yard field-goal attempt sailed just outside  the right upright.  </P> <P> "Missing that field goal by a foot hurt us," Pascoe said. "I guess we're the  hunter and not the huntee (in the league race). We're going to have to go after  Edison."  </P></p>

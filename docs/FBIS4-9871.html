			<p>BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 30 Mar (PL) -- Cuban President  Fidel Castro has acknowledged the newspaper EL TIEMPO's  recantation of reports published about an alleged guerrilla  summit in Cuba which reportedly was attended by a Colombian  clergyman.    In a letter sent to Director Fernando Santos Castillo, which  the most important newspaper in Colombia included on its front  page today, the head of the Cuban revolution states "the issue  was important and difficult."    "(The incident) could have serious and unwanted  repercussions, concerning the credibility of many persons and  the relations between our nations," the letter emphasizes.    EL TIEMPO published, beginning on 10 March, a series of  alleged important revelations concerning the aforementioned  January summit in Havana with Bishop Nel Beltran's  participation, despite the Cuban Government's reiterated  assurances and denials.    The existence of that meeting was even personally denied by  Bishop Beltran, Catholic Church leaders, and the most important  Colombian Government officials. Nevertheless, since the Attorney  General's Office presented what was purportedly evidence, the  government decided to request an explanation from Cuba, which  was immediately answered.    The newspaper, which recanted its report on Sunday, admitted  it had been manipulated by still unspecified interests, and  apologized to the Cuban Government, Nel Beltran, and its  readers, in an action that is termed important because it is so  unusual.    "I consider it my duty to express my sincere appreciation  for  the step taken by EL TIEMPO to deny recent reports that were  published by the same newspaper and that do not conform to the  truth, and to apologize to Monsignor Nel Beltran and the Cuban  Government," Fidel Castro states in his letter.    "By explaining the incident, reporting the hoax of which it  had been a victim, and apologizing to those involved, EL TIEMPO  has shown courage and honesty. We recognize this; we accept  your apologies, and we congratulate the newspaper's board of  directors, its journalists, and its workers for this attitude,  which greatly exalts you," the Cuban statesman adds.    "We hope and wish that all of us will learn a useful lesson  from this unpleasant incident, and that mutual respect and  relations between the peoples of Colombia and Cuba will be  strengthened," the Cuban revolution leader's letter to EL TIEMPO  ends.</p>

			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUR FALLOUT FROM L.A. TEACHERS' BONANZA  </P> <P> For historically underpaid teachers, the new contract with the Los Angeles  Board of Education is a welcome first step toward more adequate compensation.  However, the financial obligations imposed on the district by this settlement  do not bode well for its budgetary future. In addition, teachers from the  surrounding districts are already flocking to Los Angeles, where the bigger  money is, leaving neighboring districts facing severe shortages.  </P> <P> As if these were not troubles enough, there is the sobering fact that the new  contract did not guarantee greater teacher accountability or provide funds for  improved instruction for our students.  </P> <P> Traditionally, annual salary increases for teachers have been limited to the  cost-of-living increase in the funds the state provides. Last year, this was  4.1%. This year it is 4.6%. But to end a strike that was costly to students and  disturbing to the public, the school board agreed in June to give its teachers  salary increases of 24%, at a rate of 8% per year over three years. This is  almost twice the state's provision.  </P> <P> The funds to meet the higher salaries are coming from cost savings achieved by  cutting programs, from lottery funds, (which the state discourages districts  from using for fixed costs), from strike savings, contingency funds and staff  reductions. But there is only so much that can be cut, given the large  percentage of the district's budget that salaries take, and the resources  available for students' instruction are certain to be diminished by this  financial crunch.  </P> <P> A related problem is that the contract is already having an adverse impact on  the dozensof school districts in Los Angeles County, as teachers defect to L.A.  Unified. Compton, Lynwood and Torrance are among the many more school districts  experiencing major teacher losses.  </P> <P> L.A. Unified has become a raider, hiring some of the area's best teachers,  particularly those trained in math, science and bilingual education. The  Compton Unified School District has lost more than 65 teachers to Los Angeles  this semester alone. Teachers submitting their resignations said plainly they  were leaving to work for Los Angeles because those $5,000 to $10,000 annual  increases proved an irresistible lure.  </P> <P> Although other districts cannot afford to match the L.A. Unified contract terms  because they do not have the resources to juggle to pay the costs, their  teachers and their union representatives are using the Los Angeles contract as  the benchmark for their own negotiations and are asking for the same pay  increases. This puts an unfair burden, fiscally and educationally, on other  districts, which must make serious cuts in their programs and/or lay off other  needed personnel if they are to pay teachers more than the state-provided  cost-of-living increases.  </P> <P> The state must avert what is surely an impending disaster to the dozens of  districts neighboring L.A. Unified by raising the cost-of-living increases for  teacher salaries this year, either just in Los Angeles County or throughout the  state, and continuing to do so until teachers are receiving professional  salaries. Supplemental funds must also be allocated by the state as direct  funding for salaries. For example, Compton, the 14th-largest school district in  the state, needs at least $20 million this year to remain competitive with Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> The L.A. Unified contract has another serious flaw. Teachers were not held to  any higher degree of accountability for the quality of instruction in exchange  for the district's concession on wages.  </P> <P> Educators in L.A. Unified and all the other 91 districts in the county must  understand that they cannot be well-paid and receive joint decision-making  powers without assuming greater accountability for the teaching of our  children. They should, for instance, be required to make specific numbers of  home contacts, and to reach goals for the academic achievement of students and  for parent involvement.  </P> <P> California at one time led the nation in quality education. Today, the test  scores and academic achievements of our students are at an all-time low.  Educators must redouble their efforts to reverse this trend, and parents and  the community must raise their expectations and insist on results.  </P> <P> We all welcome higher pay for teachers, but it should not come at the expense  of programs for students. Nor should it be granted without assurances that  educators will do a better job. And clearly, students in school districts  outside Los Angeles need and deserve quality educational opportunities, which  they will not receive if the present teacher drain continues.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BIG MIX;  </P> <P> VIDEO;  </P> <P> SO MANY VIDEO STORES, SO MANY LANGUAGES. . .;  </P> <P> INDIA: ACTION, SONG AND DANCE  </P> <P> In Bombay Spices, a shop along Pioneer Boulevard in Artesia, the air is  redolent with the scent of curry and sandalwood. Herbs, spices and other  foodstuffs line the shelves, along with articles of traditional Indian dress  and, as touted by a sign in the window, "knit sweaters, cardigans, tops and  fancy shoes from England."  </P> <P> The tiny shop also has more than 1,200 videotapes lining the wall behind the  register. The titles are mostly in Hindi and Punjabi, with a few English titles  -- "Hero," "Divorce," "Coolie" -- scattered throughout. One of the tapes,  entitled "Bijliyann" (which translates roughly as Electric), is playing on a  small, battered color TV near the back of the shop.  </P> <P> In one scene, a number of tough-but-sexy women in Western dress fight off a  throng of oafish male assailants. In another scene, the gang's leader does a  slinky, MTV-style lip-sync to a bouncy disco tune. There is a hint of slapstick  as well, as one character bumbles through a scene a la Jerry Lewis.  </P> <P> To a Western eye, the film seems oddly jumbled. But according to shop owner  Bhupinder Singh Batra (shown on Page 1 with his wife), the mixture of action,  music and comedy is a formula in Indian cinema.  </P> <P> "There is adventure, suspense, fighting," Batra explains. "Very few (films) are  based on one particular theme."  </P> <P> Then there is the music. Bombay Spices carries several shelves of audio music  tapes, and nearly all, Batra says, are collections of film tunes. "There must  be at least four or five songs" for a film to be successful, Batra says. "There  was a time when it was more classical and such. But now you will find more  disco songs."  </P> <P> Artesia, originally settled by Dutch and Portuguese immigrants, is now home to  a number of ethnic communities, including Latino, Vietnamese and Indian  enclaves. The stretch of Pioneer between 183rd Street and the Artesia Freeway  (California 91) contains what is probably the largest concentration of Indian  businesses in Southern California, including restaurants, clothing stores,  jewelry shops and markets.  </P> <P> "Sometimes they call it 'Little India,' " Batra says with a chuckle. "It's  nothing like the Chinese and Korean communities, though. It's just a few  shops." Bombay Spices once had a monopoly on the local video business, but now  several nearby markets rent Indian videos.  </P> <P> Down the street, at Ganesh Groceries, a pair of customers browse the video  shelves. "These have to do with social themes, the way society treats people,"  says Nagarajian R. of Los Angeles, holding up two tapes he had selected.  </P> <P> He classifies the films as social dramas but adds that, typically, Indian  movies always include elements of action, music and romance. But the Indian  portrayal of romance, he emphasizes, differs from that commonly found in  American films: "It's not based on sex. . . . You won't ever find nudity in an  Indian film."  </P> <P> While he enjoys Indian cinema, R. is also a fan of American films. His friend,  Bijili B. of Culver City, says she prefers Indian movies -- not out of a sense  of obligation, she explains, but because it gives her a needed cultural  connection to the homeland. "It helps me see what is happening at home," she  explains.  </P> <P> "The new generation, the ones who are brought up here, don't have much interest  in Indian movies," says Bishan Dutt, proprietor of nearby India Video &amp;  Records. "The ones who were born and brought up in India prefer to see movies  from India."  </P> <P> His shop is set up like a typical English-language video or music shop, with  empty video sleeves displayed on the walls and records and tapes in a rack  running down the center of the floor. Dutt says his shop is the only one in  Southern California that deals in Indian video and music exclusively.  </P> <P> Currently, one of the hottest items in Indian video is "Ramayan," a made-for-TV  adaptation of the "Ramayana," a Sanskrit epic written in the 3rd Century BC.  India would literally shut down when the series was shown on television there,  Dutt says.  </P> <P> On video, "Ramayan's" 23 episodes total more than 50 hours. Dutt says it is  actually more popular as a sale item than as a rental, because "people want to  have it for their children."  </P> <P> "Ramayan," though, is an exception. Most of the tapes Dutt stocks fall into the  action/adventure/comedy/musical/romance category that Indian film makers seem  to specialize in. "Fight, dance and songs" are elements of almost all Indian  feature films, Dutt says, because reality doesn't sell in India. Moviegoers  want escape.  </P> <P> And part of that escape is music. "You will find that one (film) in 50 or so is  not" a musical, Dutt says. The 50th he categorizes as an "art" film, one that  deals more in reality, and it is here that India and Hollywood find their  common ground.  </P> <P> "They don't make money, here or in India," Dutt says of art films from his  homeland. "They're made to win awards."  </P> <P>  Bombay Spices, 18628 Pioneer Blvd., (213) 860-9949.  </P> <P> This special issue was edited by David Fox, Sunday Calendar assistant editor.  </P></p>

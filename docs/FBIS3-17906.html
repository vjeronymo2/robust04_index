Ivan Yemets, chairman of the Central  Electoral Commission, confirmed that the elections had taken  place in all 450 constituencies. Forty-nine deputies were  elected in the first round, of whom 11 are engineers, 13  education workers, three lawyers and economists. With regard to  party affiliation, the deputies have been divided in the  following manner: 12 are members of the Communist Party of  Ukraine; four are Rukh members; two each from the Ukrainian  Republican Party, Peasants Party of Ukraine, [SelPU] Congress of  Ukrainian Nationalists [KUN] and the Socialist Party of Ukraine;  one from the Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party -- party  leader Stepan Khmara, and 24 have no party affiliation.    In the words of Ivan Yemets, the overwhelming majority of  parties are maintaining their positions in the second round. In  the first instance this concerns the communists, socialists and  the national-democrats. Ivan Yemets expressed confidence that  the "second round would give Ukraine a new parliament."  Replying to a question about how many deputies would be  required in order for the new parliament to start working, Ivan  Yemets said: "There are some discrepancies with the current  legislation in relation to this question, therefore it will be  ascertained later how many deputies, 226 or 301, will be  required".    Speaking about the poll in Crimea, Ivan Yemets said that the  Central Electoral Commission had nothing whatsoever to do with  this process. It was a matter purely for the president of  Crimea. It was reported that the majority of district electoral  commissions had scheduled the second round of elections for 10  April. On this matter, Ivan Yemets called on representatives of  the press to make every effort to explain to the population the  necessity of electing a new parliament.</p>

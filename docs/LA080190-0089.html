			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEARINGS OKD ON INSURANCE RATE ROLLBACKS;  </P> <P> LITIGATION: JUDGE RULES THAT CHALLENGES TO A REBATE ORDER SHOULD ONLY COME  AFTER A COMPANY IS TOLD BY THE COMMISSIONER TO GRANT THE REBATES.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles Superior Court judge ruled against the insurance industry Tuesday  and gave Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie the go-ahead for an immediate  start of company rate rollback hearings under terms of Proposition 103.  </P> <P> Explaining that she had changed her mind after further study of the legal  issues, Judge Dzintra Janavs said that the time for a legal challenge of  Gillespie's standard for judging whether a company will have to grant rebates  of 1989 premiums is after a company receives a specific rollback order, not  before.  </P> <P> Under Gillespie's standard, any company found to have had profits exceeding  11.2% in 1989 in auto, homeowner, commercial and other lines combined will be  ordered to rebate the difference to its customers up to a maximum of 20% of the  total premium. The companies will also be required to pay 10% interest on the  sums owed since 1989.  </P> <P> Five leading insurance companies -- USAA, Progressive, Safeco, Allstate and the  California State Auto Assn. -- had contended that they should be permitted to  challenge Gillespie's 11.2% standard before any specific company hearings  began, thus adding another lengthy round of litigation to what has already been  a two-year industry fight against implementing Proposition 103 rollback  provisions.  </P> <P> These insurers had been supported in court by scores of other insurers, and at  first Janavs indicated she would go along. She delayed hearings that Gillespie  had scheduled for the five companies on July 18.  </P> <P> But at a lengthy hearing Monday and in her ruling Tuesday, Janavs said she had  concluded that Gillespie's rollback rules were not final until she had directed  companies to actually rebate some money. All such administrative proceedings  must be complete before the companies can legally challenge them, she ruled.  </P> <P> Janavs' decision, and two others she made Monday, indicated she might be more  consumer-oriented and less industry-oriented than a prior judge assigned to  hear Proposition 103 cases. That judge, Miriam Vogel, yielded the cases to  Janavs when she was promoted by Gov. George Deukmejian from the Superior Court  to the state Court of Appeal. On Monday, Janavs also dismissed company lawsuits  aimed at overturning requirements that they sell assigned-risk auto policies at  the current, relatively low rates.  </P> <P> Gillespie aides said that the commissioner will now go ahead with one or more  company rollback hearings as soon as she can give proper legal notice.  </P> <P> The commissioner's special counsel for Proposition 103 implementation, Karl  Rubinstein, said he expects the companies that are first ordered to rebate  money will challenge the order in court, and this will form a test case on  Gillespie's standards. Once the courts ruled on it, he said, all other  companies would be forced to comply in quick order with any rollback standards  that had been upheld.  </P> <P> Gillespie had originally vowed to complete all rollback-rebate decisions by  last November, but lengthy hearings and court challenges by the industry have  held her up.  </P></p>

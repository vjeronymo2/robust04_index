			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Jobs: First trial for subsidised self-marketing - Bowater sponsors advertising space for unemployed business-development executives IT takes more than rising with the lark to get one up on a chief executive. Mind you, the Jobs column thought it had done the trick the other cockcrow when it telephoned Bowater's David Lyon at his office. 'I'll put you through,' said a brisk yet friendly operator, and tried . . . but no answer. So on getting through to him later, I contrived to mention - though good-humouredly of course - that I had called him before, just after eight. He knew, he replied. As it was a Monday, he'd had to come in from the country and had not been at his desk as early as usual. 'But when I got in and called you back minutes after, you weren't there,' he added. 'You rang me from home, didn't you?' Touche ] The reason for my original dawn activity was that Mr Lyon had let slip the fact that he is in the habit of conducting job-interviews at 8am, and candidates who happen to be currently unemployed have impressed him by never failing to turn up on the dot. But the reason why he made the disclosure in the first place was the proposal put forward in this corner of the FT a week ago. As some in today's congregation may not have been present then, however, I had better recapitulate a little. The aim of the scheme, brainchild of redundancy victim Peter Laurence, is to give folk in his unfortunate position a bit of help towards finding new work. His idea is that this paper should try to provide them with a subsidised market by inviting employers to contribute - say - half the cost of a regular space in our recruitment-advertising pages, in which people out of work could offer their skills at a commensurately reduced price. When I put the idea to the FT's classified advertisement director Brian Powell, he not only agreed that it was worth giving a go, but said he'd join in the sponsoring by running the ad at a special rate. Hence my request last week for corporate volunteers willing, at least in principle, to support the enterprise. The result has been nearly a dozen letters and telephone calls, not all from enthusiasts for the scheme. Seven, although mostly conceding that it would do no harm, say it falls far short of what is required. In their view, the need is for government action, and they suggest various types of taxpayers' subsidies to persuade organisations to fill their job openings from the ranks of the unemployed. To which my own response is that their argument, while perhaps sensible, misses the point. It may well be that far more help than the sponsored ad is needed, and that government might get round to providing same in time. But Mr Laurence's idea has the strength of being something that could be done quickly, and by a relative handful of companies at that. Alas, getting the necessary few together is another matter. After all, companies can be forgiven for not leaping forward to give money at times like these. Accordingly, I wasn't expecting the idea to become reality for a while. And nor will it do so - or, at any rate, not in the shape of a regular sponsored market-place. But thanks to David Lyon (who for all his difficulties in getting in on time on Mondays, clearly acts fast) we can run a limited, one-off trial. On his initiative, Bowater is joining the FT in subsidising an ad big enough to carry short self-advertisements by six unemployed people with one particular type of skill - in business development. For those inclined to try selling themselves therein, however, there are certain snags. One is that if their message appears, it will cost them Pounds 50. Another is that they are subject to an absolute top limit of 60 words which must include their name and any restrictions on where they are willing to work. A third is that, if the offer is over-subscribed, the six to appear will be chosen at random. The last is that their copy must reach me here at the latest on Wednesday, February 19, so the ad can run the following week. Which said, I'll wait to hear from you. NOW to the table alongside, which is compiled from the PA Consulting Group's latest survey of United Kingdom employers' plans for recruiting graduates. Anyone wanting the survey, price Pounds 420, should contact Jenny Cambridge of PA at 123 Buckingham Palace Rd, London SW1W 9SR; telephone 071-730 9000, fax 071-333-5050. My table is limited to the pay aspects of the 91 participating organisations' graduate-recruitment policies. The figures, all averages, are broken down by the employing outfits' sector of activity. First come the starting salaries actually paid to degree-winners who were newly taken on in 1991, followed by estimates (where ventured) of those to be paid to those recruited this year. Then, for the six right-hand columns of the table, we turn from new entrants to people engaged earlier, and from basic salaries alone to total cash pay including bonuses. The first pair of the six refer to graduates with one year's service, the next two pairs to those with three, and five years respectively. In each case a distinction is made for quality of work. The first of each pair of columns shows the typical total cash rewards of just 'adequate' or averagely performing staff. The second does likewise for their 'high-flying' counterparts. From what I hear, demand for new graduates this year is well down even on the depressed levels of 12 months ago. Nevertheless the estimated starting salaries are higher, apparently by 14 per cent in the case of banks although by only 2 per cent on the overall figure.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 11 (KCNA) -- The U.S.  imperialists on February 9 staged a long-distance bombing  exercise against the northern half of Korea in the skies above  Yongwol and Pyongchang, South Korean Kangwon Province, with  pursuit-assault planes and refueling tankers introduced to  increase the capacities of mobility and surprise strike of the  overseas-based flying corps, according to military sources.    On the same day, a "P-3" anti-submarine patrol plane which  took off from the Yokosuka base of Japan staged a strike  exercise above the waters of South Korea, making low- and  ultra-low altitude flights.    On February 8 and 9, large-calibre artillery units and armed  bandits of the South Korean puppet Army kicked up a row in  various areas of Paju County, and Chorwon and Yonchon Counties  of South Korean Kangwon Province adjacent to the Demilitarized  Zone along the Military Demarcation Line, firing at random  artillery pieces and large-calibre machine guns and automatic  rifles.    The frenzied play with fire of the U.S. imperialists and the  South Korean puppets is a grave challenge to the unanimous  desire of the Korean people and the world peaceloving peoples  for peace and detente on the Korean peninsula.</p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Dan-Air doctor to explain failure to shareholders SHAREHOLDERS who have lost their entire investment in Davies &amp; Newman, parent company of Dan-Air, will this weekend receive a lengthy explanation of what went wrong from Mr David James, the erstwhile company doctor-chairman. His story of how the UK's oldest independent airline lost that independence to British Airways is told in a circular to shareholders, who will be asked to approve the winding up of Davies &amp; Newman at an extraordinary meeting on December 7. The document ranges back to 1922, when Davies &amp; Newman was launched in shipping, and to 1953 when Dan-Air started flying. It ended up as the largest operator at Gatwick with more than a fifth of the slots, a mantle that BA will assume via the Pounds 1 takeover. Mr James was called in two years ago and the first refinancing involved extending the bank borrowing limit to Pounds 80m. In October last year another crisis was averted by a Pounds 49.3m rescue rights issue. How it all unravelled is explained in the circular, which covers: Talks with 20 airlines - including Virgin Atlantic, British Midland and Air UK, plus ones from continental Europe, the US and the Far East; How interim operating losses snowballed to Pounds 24m through lower than expected passenger numbers and yields; How escalating cancellations hit the charter operation. In June the cancellation rate approached 10 per cent. By August it was running at more than 25 per cent. Balance sheet problems arising from the need to sell old-fashioned aircraft for much less than book value. As the net worth of the company fell, so did the borrowing limit. This autumn the banks, which had received Pounds 8.75m in special fees, had virtually no exposure to the company; The company's last business plan envisaged cutting net losses to a couple of million next year. The devaluation of the pound led to another Pounds 10m being added to that estimate. In late September, Mr James tried to pull together a combination of new money from institutions and Pounds 10m from the personal fortune of Mr Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic Airways. When Mr Branson pulled out, Mr James said he was desperate. Final calls and faxes to the heads of other airlines received just one positive response, from Lord King of BA, which earlier in the summer walked away from the idea of chartering Dan-Air to run some scheduled services from Gatwick. In return for taking on Pounds 35m of liabilities - including Pounds 13m of ticket holders, BA has acquired 12 relatively new Boeing 737s and 14 of Dan-Air's 29 scheduled services. The charter business has closed. The letting down of shareholders has raised some questions about the handling of the episode by Mr James, who has also been involved as company doctor at Lep Group, the freight forwarding and security concern. Was it wise to expand the scheduled side in a recession? Did he cut costs quickly and deeply enough? Did he take on too much in heading both Davies &amp; Newman and Lep? Did he act soon enough to try to bring in a trading partner? Did he do more for the banks than the shareholders? He admits that shareholders might feel the urge to take him by the scruff of the neck. (Bankers, however, might want to shake his hand.) With Dan-Air disposed of, he is once again under pressure from the City to take on another company in intensive care.</p>

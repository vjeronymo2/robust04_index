Our Army  is always a place for the gathering of many young people. Being  young soldiers determined to dedicate ourselves to national  defense in modern times, whom should we worship?    Historical experience and current needs in reality all tell  us: We should take the heroic figures who dedicated their whole  lives to national independence, people's liberation, and social  progress as our examples, and should let these heroic figures  firmly occupy the "star position" in our minds.    The heroic figures of our party and our Army are outstanding  representatives of the masses in their hundreds of millions  emerging in the prolonged practice of revolution and  construction. Some of them are national heroes who have made  immortal contributions to national liberation and independence,  and they include such proletarian revolutionaries of the older  generation as Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, and  Deng Xiaoping; some of them are revolutionary martyrs with iron  will power, such as Yang Jingyu, Fang Zhimin, Ye Ting, and Jiang  Zhujun, who were determined to shed their blood for the cause of  the party and sacrifice their lives to show their loyalty to the  party; some of them are combat heroes such as Dong Cunrui, Huang  Jiguang, Yang Zirong, and Yang Yucai, who fought bravely and  defeated the enemies with a fearless spirit; some of them are  communist fighters such as Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Ouyang Hai, and  Su Ning, who served the people wholeheartedly in the peaceful  environment and dedicated themselves to the service of their  country through diligent work; some of them are pioneers on the  front of scientific research such as Qian Xuesen, Deng Jiaxian,  and Qian Shaojun, who created miracles again and again in  scaling the heights of modern national defense science and  technology in their hard work over the past decades; some of  them are physically disabled people who have healthy minds and  make great contributions to the party's cause, such as Wu  Yunduo, Shi Guangzhu, and Li Zhijun; and others are innumerous  unknown heroes who never claim credit for their meritorious  services, such as "living martyrs" Li Yuan, Jiang Yuduo, and Cao  Faqing. The mentality, character, and will of these heroic  figures give expression to the supreme realm of thought that  communists should attain, and also represent the lofty virtues  of the revolutionary soldiers. We can say that every hero is a  banner. To study, live, work, and fight as the heroes did, we  shall be able to establish the proletarian world outlook as soon  as possible, realize the value of revolutionary life to the  maximum, stand all tests in the course of reform, opening, and  developing the socialist market economy, and always preserve our  revolutionary youth.    Emulating the heroes, creating heroic deeds, and taking the  path of a hero is always the glorious tradition of this Army.  In both wartime and peacetime, as soon as millions of young  people join this Army, they begin to really worship and emulate  the heroic figures, although some of them have just begun to  understand the theory of revolution; their mentality also begins  to rise to a lofty realm, and their behavior also becomes great.  The course of many heroes' growth in this Army shows that they  first worship heroes, then emulate heroes and also strive to  become heroes themselves. Young people are undergoing the  process of forming their world outlook, and their minds are  rather malleable. In light of this characteristic of young  people, we should guide young soldiers to admire heroic figures,  continuously adjust their life orientation, and take the  initiative in emulating the examples. This is a necessary  condition and the most effective way to cultivate more heroes.  For various reasons, the values cherished by young people are  now becoming more diverse. In such circumstances, we should  draw the attention of young officers and servicemen to  worshiping and emulating heroes, and should encourage them to  become heroes themselves. This will certainly play a  significant role in prompting them to become soldiers with a  lofty ideal of revolution, with lofty morals, good education,  and a strong sense of discipline as soon as possible.    Serving the people wholeheartedly is the sole purpose of  this  Army. Our soldiers are required to be ready to shed their blood  and sacrifice their lives to fulfill their sacred mission, and  this characteristic of the armed forces also requires us to  worship heroes. In the years of war, no matter how busy the  troops were in combat, production, and mass work, they continued  to carry out the activity of emulating heroes and striving to  become heroes. This is always an important part of this Army's  political work. Under the new historical conditions, this Army  is striving to realize the general goal of revolutionalization,  modernization, and regularization, and to fulfill the sacred  mission of providing security guarantees for reform, opening,  and socialist modernization. We should still vigorously carry  forward the spirit of revolutionary heroism, continue to carry  forward the "five revolutionary spirits" advocated by Comrade  Deng Xiaoping and the 64-character pioneering spirit advocated  by Chairman Jiang. This should become a strong mental pillar  for promoting this Army's comprehensive development. Therefore,  admiring and emulating heroic figures and creating heroic deeds  should become common conduct of contemporary revolutionary  soldiers.    This Army is the candle of innumerous heroes. In order to  bring about more heroic figures under the new situation, leaders  and political organs at all levels should fully use various  effective educational forms, such as reading books, giving  lectures, holding singing parties, arranging glory rooms, seeing  good films, and listening to old comrades's talk about the  tradition, to give wide publicity to the heroic figures in  various periods and on various fronts so that our cadres and  soldiers will always live in the atmosphere of revolutionary  heroism, and more brilliant stars will rise to make the life in  the barracks more vigorous.</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Hungary passes tough budget HUNGARY'S government yesterday pushed through parliament a 1993 budget designed to contain the spiralling deficit and return the country to the good graces of the International Monetary Fund. The conservative coalition agreed an unpopular increase in value-added tax to help keep next year's budget deficit down to Ft185bn (Pounds 1.48bn), equivalent to 5.9 per cent of forecast GDP, the level which the IMF had indicated it would accept. The passage of the budget should allow a resumption of the IMF's SDR1.14bn (Pounds 1.037bn) three-year programme of credits for Hungary. Hungary was suspended earlier this year because of budget overruns tarnishing its claims to be eastern Europe's star economic performer. The main change in taxation was the imposition of 6 per cent VAT on staple foods and most other zero-rated products against impassioned protests during which dozens of people started hunger strikes. Mr Mihaly Kupa, the finance minister, justified his budget, which has come under attack from all sides, as a balance of thrift against the public's 'ability to tolerate'. Another senior official described the budget as the toughest imaginable in the political circumstances.</p>

			<p>920707 -{EADLANE- FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (28): Golfers tee up for computer guidance - Case Study / Bettagolf/LSI / An ambitious golf products company hopes it has hit a hole-in-one with a software package to help record and analyse shots. GOLF CAN BE a lifetime obsession: its devotees spend many hours playing and analysing their game, endeavouring to improve their performance. Bettagolf Products provides tools for golfers, enabling them to record, during the game, which clubs they used, and where, the weather conditions and the shape and contours of the greens. The results help them to analyse and improve their game. These products come in the form of booklets: the Scorecard, the Analyser and the Greenmachine, which are sold through Professional Golfers Association (PGA) outlets. Bettagolf's managing director, Alan Wooley, reckons that there are around 2,000 people using the system, since the company's launch in November 1991, with each booklet selling for Pounds 5.99. Golf is a very popular among businessmen, and a lubricant to the oils of commerce in many parts of the world. In Japan, for example, it is reckoned that 23m people play. A version of the system running on a PC should, therefore, attract a lot of interest when it goes on the market shortly. Development of the software (called Pro-Am Plus) was undertaken by Logical Systems International (LSI), a software house specialising in development of database developments - 'we looked at two other houses,' says Alan Wooley, 'but LSI's professionalism and reputation swung it.' The product had to be able to run on industry standard PCs, and the Foxpro database package was chosen as the development tool. This allows complete systems to be developed very easily, using screen-based tools. LSI offered a fixed price contract, and produced a project plan for the development - 'some software houses promise the earth but don't deliver. LSI kept us fully informed and all our targets were met. They are a very good professional outfit,' says Mr Wooley. 'Some extras were added to the product as we went along, at no extra charge.' The project lasted for around four months: LSI also wrote product manuals. Bettagolf has no in-house development resources. It plans to use LSI to perform any enhancements or maintenance to the product which may be needed at time and materials rates. Pro-Am Plus is designed to be simple to use, suitable even for those who have not operated a computer before. On-line help facilities are available, even though these were not originally specified. 'To say it is user friendly is an understatement' says Mr Wooley. 'It tells you what you are doing at the bottom of the screen all the time.' The software is a commodity item which will sell at Pounds 24.99. At that price the product must be usable without reference to its supplier, and must have rock solid reliability. The use of an outside company for the development of such a system may be thought to be somewhat dangerous. If problems arise, it may cost a lot of money to have them resolved. It would be impractical, however, for a start-up company like Bettagolf to employ the number of people needed for such a development - the team peaked at six people. As long as the developer is competent, using an outside consultant makes a lot of sense. The product is now reaching the market. Only time will tell how successful it is; Alan Wooley, however, is confident - 'we wanted it to be as simple to use as the manual system, and LSI did that for us.'</p>

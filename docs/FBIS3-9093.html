			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Hajrudin Sermic report from Maglaj] </F>   [Text] Events are developing fast in Maglaj. The most  important news is that last night chetniks withdrew all their  artillery pieces to the left bank of the Bosna River, to the  positions on Mount Crni Vrh, near Teslic, where they were  deployed before 24 June 1993, thus opening the  Maglaj-Zepce-Zenica road, and a 15-kilometer frontline around  Maglaj by which they kept this town under siege for more than  nine months. UN troops are already being deployed along the  former chetnik positions.    A pontoon bridge on the Bosna River near [name indistinct]  was also dismantled last night. The Serb aggressor used the  bridge for the transit of weapons and manpower between Mount  Ozren and Teslic. The Croatian Defense Council has taken over  the checkpoint on the Maglaj-Zepce road near [name indistinct)  and UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]-mediated negotiations on the  joint control of the road by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the  Croatian Defense Council are in progress. It should also be  said that the Zepce Croatian Defense Council has secured the  return of 200 inhabitants of this town to their homes, from  where they were evicted to Maglaj four months ago.

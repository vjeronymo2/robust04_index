			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Cost to business of VAT is Pounds 1bn The cost to businesses of complying with value added tax is about Pounds 1.6bn, the National Audit Office says in a report published today. The costs were partially offset, however, by cashflow benefits of around Pounds 600m because traders often hold VAT for between one and four months before handing it over to the government. The NAO also estimates indirect management benefits of about Pounds 150m as the requirement to produce regular and reliable VAT returns encourages businesses to maintain better accounts and records. Nonetheless, in order to bring down the increasing costs of VAT compliance the NAO recommends: A review of the regulatory framework, identifying the primary law on which each regulation is based. An analysis of where the main compliance costs for businesses arise and a strategy for simplifying existing regulations, with targets for the number of regulations to be reviewed each year. Monitoring of changes to see if the expected benefits and cost reductions are achieved. The report points out that the government's de-regulation initiative, which aims to cut the regulatory burden on businesses, is committed to simplifying all systems. But of 600 regulations selected for possible reform by government task forces reviewing red tape, only eight relate to VAT. The NAO says that, in some cases, VAT might be simplified by abolishing regulations or reducing their scope. And in some instances new regulations can produce cost savings. Since 1985 there have been 209 regulatory changes affecting VAT. The NAO estimates that 40 were intended to reduce compliance costs, 145 had little or no affect, and 24 would potentially have increased compliance costs. Some 14 of these 24 related to changes required by European legislation. The report calls on the government to ensure that all proposals for new VAT regulations are accompanied by an assessment of the cost to businesses of complying with them.</p>

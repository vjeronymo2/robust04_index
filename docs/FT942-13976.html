			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Plastic card spending surges Consumer credit and debit card spending on leisure activities grew strongly before April's tax rises but retail spending growth slowed, figures published yesterday show. The Credit Card Research Group said consumers spent a total of Pounds 12.67bn using credit and debit cards in the first three months of this year. That was 9 per cent lower than the amount spent in the previous three months  -mainly because of seasonal factors - but 16 per cent higher than the same period last year. Spending on credit cards was Pounds 7.90bn, 10 per cent higher than in the same quarter last year, while the amount spent on debit cards rose by 25 per cent to Pounds 4.77bn. Total credit and debit card spending on entertainment such as restaurants and cinemas was Pounds 731m in the first quarter, a rise of 23 per cent on a year ago, and spending on hotels was 16 per cent higher. In contrast, spending growth in the retail sector was much weaker. Total spending in department stores, catalogues and mail order businesses grew by 3 per cent in the first quarter over the year before. The CCRG, which is financed by the credit card industry, said growth in total spending in March was slower than in the previous two months, possibly reflecting caution before April's tax rises.</p>

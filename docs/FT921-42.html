			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Premature push into a financial hot seat: Robert Peston on the appointment of a new boss at NatWest, the UK high street bank embroiled in the Blue Arrow affair The porter working in the chairman's suite of National Westminster Bank was phlegmatic in response to the news that Mr Tom Frost was standing down as NatWest's chief executive. 'I've seen it all before,' he said as he operated the controls of the comfortingly antique lift reserved for the use of the chairman, Lord Alexander. However the porter, who took up his job in 1973, long before any of the current board, cannot claim to have witnessed any banking banana skin to compare with NatWest's involvement in the Pounds 837m Blue Arrow rights issue of 1987. Mr Frost has become the 11th senior executive of NatWest whose career has taken a sharp turn for the worse as a result of the bank's involvement in the rights issue. He is giving up the post of chief executive more than a year earlier than planned and will be replaced by Mr Derek Wanless, currently the bank's deputy chief executive. The reason for the change is that the Deparment of Trade and Industry re-opened its investigation into the Blue Arrow affair just over two weeks ago. However, Mr Frost is not leaving the group. He has been appointed a deputy chairman, to give him more time 'to deal with the DTI investigation', in the words of Lord Alexander. 'We were hopeful that after four years that would be the end of Blue Arrow,' Lord Alexander said yesterday. However, it was not to be. During the recent Blue Arrow trial - in which two subsidiaries of NatWest together with seven individuals and UBS Phillips and Drew, the securities house, were accused of conspiring to mislead the market over the outcome of the Blue Arrow issue - a number of allegations were made against Mr Frost, who till then had escaped all criticism relating to the affair. The central allegation was that Mr Frost had withheld important information about his involvement in the issue from DTI inspectors during their first investigation in 1988. There were three other specific allegations against him: He was accused of being involved in redrafting a memo on the Blue Arrow issue to NatWest's board in order to tone down any implications of malpractice by NatWest in the issue. He was said to have dragged his feet when asked by the previous chairman, Lord Boardman, to take advice from a new firm of solicitors on the legality of NatWest's role in the issue. It was also alleged that he was complicit in withholding relevant information on the rights issue to an internal NatWest inspector who was examining the bank's behaviour in early 1988. The nub of these accusations is that Mr Frost was involved in a cover-up. He says however that the court had access to only limited information. He declares himself innocent and says he is confident of vindicating himself. However his solicitors have advised him that he should not give details of his rebuttals before talking to the inspectors. Mr Frost's departure from the top job is not a response to shareholder pressure, Lord Alexander said, even though the Blue Arrow allegations have been widely publicised and some analysts have also criticised Mr Frost's performance. Lord Alexander added that he had informed the Governor of the Bank of England of the impending change, but that the Bank had played no role in the changes. Mr Frost's main legal adviser is Mr Nick Wilson, a former partner of Slaughter and May, the solicitors. Mr Wilson has discussed with the DTI inspectors their likely requirements in this new investigation. As a result, Mr Wilson is convinced that Mr Frost will have to spend a considerable amount of time working with the inspectors. Mr Frost said he therefore came to the conclusion that he could not cope with both the inquiry and working as chief executive. So Mr Wanless, at the age of 44, is getting his opportunity earlier than anyone expected, though Lord Alexander confirmed yesterday that he has been the front-runner to succeed Mr Frost for some time. 'Before it all blew up. Derek was the preferred candidate,' Lord Alexander said. Mr Frost is bequeathing a bank where morale has been battered not only by Blue Arrow but also by an inexorable erosion of profits over the past three years. Only four years ago, in 1988, NatWest made bigger profits - Pounds 1.4bn before tax - than any UK bank had ever done before or has since. At the time, it was the country's biggest bank on most measures. In 1991, however, its pre tax profits collapsed to Pounds 110m, the lowest since 1975. In the second half of the 1991, the other three clearing banks - Lloyds, Barclays and Midland - all made bigger profits than Natwest. Though Mr Wanless has worked all his life at NatWest - and was a NatWest scholar at Cambridge - he is regarded by colleagues as representing change within the group. For a start, he is the youngest ever NatWest chief executive. He is also a graduate and took a first in mathematics. Till recently, most UK bank executives joined straight from school at the age of 16. He takes over at a time when NatWest is facing difficulties in three main areas: Its US operations have made big losses for the past two years, because of their exposure to the property market in the north-eastern states. It has failed to make a respectable return on its investment, made mainly in the mid-80s, in securities trading and merchant banking. It has suffered from a colossal level of losses on loans. Its charge for bad and doubtful debts in 1991 was Pounds 1.99bn, the second highest such charge ever made by a UK bank. Mr Wanless's main experience to date has not been in these areas. Prior to his appointment in February to run a new division, NatWest Markets - which combined commercial lending and securities businesses - his most senior jobs were as a director of personal banking services and as the general manager for the UK branch business. His management of services provided to individuals is generally praised by analysts. Profits from these activities have been strong, though would probably be bigger still if the bank had followed Lloyds bank's example by acquiring a life insurance company several years ago, rather than waiting till last year when it set up a joint venture with Clerical Medical. As the UK branch general manager he was responsible for lending to small and medium size businesses, which last year were responsible for hundreds of millions of pounds in bad debt charges. However, when he became general manager, in January 1989, NatWest was already the leading lender to this sector, which has been hit hard by the recession. He describes his management style as 'analytical' and said yesterday that he puts his faith in training and new technology to increase the board's control over the business. Mr Wanless was coy about saying anything which could be seen to be a criticism of his predecessor. If he is planning changes - and some say the bank needs an overhaul - he may be constrained by the continuing presence within the bank of Mr Frost. As a deputy chairman, Mr Frost will continue to have considerable influence, though he said yesterday that he would be careful to stand back to ensure that Mr Wanless did not feel cramped. Other NatWest executives said they were optimistic about the management reorganisation, though two rivals for the top job, Mr John Tugwell and Mr John Melbourn, may be disappointed. One executive said: 'There is a story in the bank that at Cambridge Mr Wanless would play chess while blindfolded against 20 opponents and still win.' Mr Wanless may find managing NatWest a bigger challenge.</p>

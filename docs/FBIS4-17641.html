			<p>BFN     [Text] TV and radio agency Novyny learned from official  sources that the negotiations in Sevastopol on the Black Sea  Fleet division between Ukraine and Russia were frustrated  through the fault of the Russian side. On 22 April at 1500 Kiev  time, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev was to hear and  sign, together with his Ukrainian counterpart Vitaliy Radetskyy,  the texts of relevant documents drafted by expert commissions.  Without explaining his unexpected decision, Grachev left the  session hall and departed from Crimea. You can hear more about  further developments in Crimea in our subsequent news bulletins.</p>

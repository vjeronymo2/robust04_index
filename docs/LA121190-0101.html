			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL PEOPLE  </P> <P> Herbert Goffstein, the 63-year-old chief executive and co-founder of Mail Boxes  Coast to Coast Inc., resigned last week from the Glendale-based franchiser.  </P> <P> Mail Boxes Coast to Coast is the largest developer of franchises for Mail Boxes  Etc., a San Diego-based chain of 1,400 postal service stores that Goffstein  also co-founded.  </P> <P> The firm, founded in 1984, focuses on the Los Angeles County and New York City  markets.  </P> <P> Goffstein, who spearheaded Mail Boxes' New York expansion and who continues to  own nearly 20% of its stock, said he resigned "to start taking it easier" and  to return to Southern California. He said his departure will save Mail Boxes  nearly $200,000 a year in salary and expenses.  </P> <P> That savings, together with the recent sale of certain Mail Boxes franchise  networks in New York, "will substantially ease the company's liquidity position  and posture the company . . . to achieve an operational profit," President Gary  M. Williams said in a statement.  </P> <P> In the nine months that ended Sept. 30, MBCC earned $81,199 on revenue of  $592,652, compared with a loss of $517,420 on revenue of $397,181 a year  earlier. Much of the latest profit stemmed from Mail Boxes sale of its Long  Island, Brooklyn and Staten Island franchises in New York.  </P> <P> The sale helped Mail Boxes cut its marketing costs and reduce its long-term  debt from about $350,000 to less than $36,000.  </P></p>

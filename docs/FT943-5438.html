			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Pounds 50,000 fine on IFA - Knight Williams hit for breaches of Fimbra rules Knight Williams, an independent financial adviser, was this week fined Pounds 50,000 for breaching 10 Fimbra rules; these included issuing misleading advertisements and failing to maintain proper client records. In addition to the fine - the second-largest imposed by Fimbra, the self-regulating body for IFAs - the company was ordered to pay Pounds 23,400 costs. Kenneth Jordan, head of the 255-member Knight Williams Investors' Action Group, said: 'The fine is derisory. What is invigorating is that Fimbra has finally done what it should have years ago.' Knight Williams, which specialises in giving advice to the elderly and retired, was the subject of an early day motion in the House of Commons in July. This referred to the number of complaints received from MPs' dissatisfied constituents. In an unusual step, the Securities and Investments Board, the chief regulator for the financial services industry, issued a statement this week saying it had been 'closely informed' of the disciplinary procedures resulting in the Fimbra fine. Knight Williams was also found to be in breach of SIB's principle 9 stating that 'a firm should organise and control its internal affairs in a responsible manner, keeping proper records'. The firm should ensure that staff employed to conduct investment business 'are suitable, adequately-trained and properly supervised, and that it has well-defined compliance procedures'. SIB added that, along with Fimbra, it would stay in close contact with Knight Williams regarding the firm's handling of complaints. Dissatisfied clients wanting to make a complaint should first address it to the company. Most of the Fimbra charges covered failings in client files; these included an inability to demonstrate that the firm had adhered to the Know Your Client and Best Advice rules. Financial advisers must be able to show they have given suitable advice to clients based on a knowledge of their investment requirements and financial circumstances. Other charges included issuing advertisements containing 'inaccurate and misleading information'; 'issuing an advertisement that was clearly not an advertisement, and which was clearly capable of being taken as a news item or editorial matter'; and 'issuing a comparison or contrast which was not clearly based on facts verified by the issuer, was not presented in a fair and balanced way, and which omitted material items'. Knight Williams, which has 24,000 clients, says it will be writing to investors whose files were criticised and will also try to identify those clients who responded to the advertisements cited by Fimbra. The company would not say how many clients were involved. In a written statement, managing director John Williams said: 'We are naturally concerned about being censured by our regulator - it is a serious matter.' The fine will be paid out of dividends to the firm's three shareholders: Robin Knight Bruce, John Williams and Stephen Prescott. The Action Group is due to meet SIB later this month. According to Jordan, who lost his own case against Knight Williams at arbitration: 'We hope to come to an arrangement to increase the chances of small investors getting a good deal.' Jordan, who favours conciliation rather than the Fimbra arbitration process, added: 'Arbitration is weighted in favour of the IFA because they have the financial and legal muscle to present their case.'</p>

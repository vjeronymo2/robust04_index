			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Allied's 61% of Aitken Hong Kong's Allied group, controlled by the controversial tycoon Mr Lee Ming-tee, has increased its stake in Aitken Hume International to 60.9 per cent, and launched a bid for the remainder at 55p a share. The offer values the company at Pounds 29.6m. Allied, which was the subject last year of a Hong Kong government investigation into alleged corporate fraud, already owned 30.2 per cent of Aitken Hume, but is purchasing a further 30.7 per cent from Said International. Aitken Hume is the banking group set up by Mr Jonathan Aitken MP, but the company sold its operating businesses in the past 18 months and was left as a cash shell. The offer values it at Pounds 29.6m, marginally above its stated net asset value. The Stock Exchange was due to remove the company's listing by October 29, unless it could develop an operating finance business. While the offer matches Aitken Hume's valuation as at March 31, a there is potential hidden value for its buyer. Aitken Hume is owed Pounds 7.5m from its sale of National Securities Research Corp.</p>

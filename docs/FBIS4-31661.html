			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "A Four-Leaf Clover Is the Symbol of the </F> Left Choice"]    [Text] Zvolen--The Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] has  received indications that the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  [HZDS] is preparing a referendum through which it would like to  shorten the current president's term of office. Such an attempt  could lead to doubts being cast on Slovakia in the world and to  new tension in Slovak society, said P. Weiss, deputy chairman of  the National Council of the Slovak Republic [NR SR] and chairman  of the SDL, at a meeting held in Zvolen yesterday with almost  120 town and city mayors from Central Slovakia who were elected  on behalf of left-wing oriented parties. Representatives of the  election coalition--Deputy Chairman S. Krcho of the Farmers  Movement; S. Holes, a member of the Social Democratic Party of  Slovakia Presidium; NR SR Deputy A. Chlapikova; and others--were  also present.    SDL Deputy Chairman D. Dorotin said that the left-wing  partners agreed at the Coalition Council on Wednesday, 8 June,  to go into the elections under the collective name of "Left  Choice" [Lavicova volba], with a program called "Social  Democratic and Green Choice for Slovakia," and with a green  four-leaf clover as its symbol. The political bodies of these  entities have still to approve the proposal.</p>

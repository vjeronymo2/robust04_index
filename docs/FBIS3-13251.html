			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Standpoint" column: "The Statement Which Exposed Their </F> Lies" by Mu'ayyad 'Abd-al-Zahrah]    [Excerpts] The Security Council's UN Special Commission  [UNSCOM] issued a statement two days ago in which it refuted  widespread claims about the Iraqi use of chemical weapons in the  Marshlands, saying they were false. The commission's denial has  come after investigations, field visits, and laboratory tests in  London, Paris, and Washington have disproved these claims, which  were lodged in a UN complaint earlier.    Although we knew the aims and motives of these lies right  from the start and said they were cheap lies intended to disturb  Iraq, justify the continuation of the blockade, and find an  excuse for further interference in Iraq's internal affairs in  the name of human rights, the UNSCOM statement has confirmed how  false and malicious were the reports submitted by Max Van der  Stoel [UN human rights official for Iraq]. The reports were  packed with lies and made unwarranted proposals about appointing  observers and setting up committees to protect what was termed  human rights in the marshlands. This Dutchman, who made endless  accusations and held news conferences everywhere to create an  uproar about alleged terrorism and weapons of mass destruction,  was certified to be reckless and nonobjective by his own  classmate, UN Secretary General Butrus Ghali, even before we  issued our own testimony on him. In fact, the statement  released by UNSCOM, which sponsored the allegations and set up  committees that spent a great deal of time on them, has come at  this time to put an end to this cheap lie and to serve as a  lesson for Van der Stoel and his backers. [passage omitted]    The UNSCOM statement is testimony for Iraq and a slap in the  face for its enemies. It has exposed their slander. This  statement has come to reveal the truth and to expose those who  spread false allegations. It now behooves the commission to  also go deep into the flood of lies that preceded this one,  whose aims have now been exposed.    Yes, the main problem now hampering the actions that must be  taken by the UN Security Council are the lies and allegations by  certain regional quarters and aggressor states. They release  them from time to time, and sometimes deny them almost  overnight, despited the fact that Iraq has affirmed its  commitment to and cooperation with implementing UN Security  Council Resolution 687, especially since the motives of those  quarters are not secret to anyone. What we want to say is that  the objective efforts to do justice to Iraq, must now find their  true course toward common positive action to remove the  injustices done to Iraq.</p>

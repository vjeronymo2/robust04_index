			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / TUC pressure mounts on Willis MR NORMAN WILLIS, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, is under strong pressure to clarify his future on the eve of this year's annual TUC congress in Blackpool. Mr Willis, who will today open the traditional pre-congress press conference, has so far made no response to growing speculation that he will announce his early retirement today or, more likely, at the TUC general council meeting tomorrow. TUC colleagues say that Mr Willis, who is 59, has privately indicated his intention not to carry on until he is 65. But he has never spelt out when he might retire. Several senior union leaders say that if Mr Willis does not announce that he will go either in January, when he is 60, or at next year's congress, they will force him out. Most senior union leaders are privately critical of Mr Willis's eight-year leadership of the TUC and hope he will leave within a year, but none has told him so to his face. Speculation about Mr Willis's future is an annual pre-congress event, but the doubts are widely believed to be more serious this year. Several colleagues and union leaders believe he is unlikely to last more than one further congress in his post. The pressure is stronger, partly because last year's pre-general election reluctance to rock the boat has disappeared. More important, Mr Willis can no longer count on the backing of the TGWU general union. Mr Ron Todd, the former TGWU general secretary, prevented any move against Mr Willis but Mr Bill Morris, the new leader, feels less loyalty. It had been thought that one of the biggest obstacles to persuading Mr Willis to leave voluntarily was his commitment to the European Trades Union Congress, where he has served a year of a four-year presidency. Some TUC officials, however, suggest it would be possible for Mr Willis to continue in office at the ETUC for a year or two after leaving his TUC job. If Mr Willis does announce his departure he is almost certain to be succeeded by Mr John Monks, his deputy, who is already effectively in day-to-day control of the organisation. The new deputy leader is likely to be Mr Brendan Barber, head of policy and organisation. The TUC has calculated that the percentage of manufacturing company profits allocated as dividends has risen from 22.8 per cent in 1985 to 74 per cent last year. It complains that this reduces the amount companies have from their own income for investment. This calculation, slightly higher than estimates made by the Bank of England, is based on Central Statistical Office data covering all incorporated companies and not only quoted ones. The figure appears in a TUC memorandum on industrial partnership and competitiveness which has been sent to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. The document also stresses that there is an important link between short-term attitudes to employment - exemplified in the 'hire and fire' culture - and short-termism in other aspects of corporate strategy. The TUC says that labour market de-regulation has encouraged employers to compete exclusively on price and not on design and quality.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / California grabs insurance nettle: A novel scheme could solve the problem of non-payment of car insurance ONE in every four Californian drivers does not have car insurance; in some inner-city areas the figure rises to four out of every five. The 'average' Californian motor policy costs about Dollars 1,000 (Pounds 649) a year, yet only half the premiums collected are paid out in claims. For years the problems of the Californian car insurance industry have held the attention of politicians, lawyers, the industry and consumer groups. Now, however, an ingenious but surprisingly simple solution - called 'pay-at-the-pump' insurance - has become a serious political proposition. Legislation to introduce a pay-at-the-pump scheme is grinding through the state legislature in Sacramento after being introduced by Mr Art Torres, a Democrat senator from Los Angeles. It has the backing of Mr John Garamendi, California's politically-ambitious insurance commissioner. Even if the Torres legislation fails, the idea may be put to the Californian electorate more directly. Mr Andrew Tobias, a Harvard-educated economic commentator whose book 'Auto Insurance Alert' was the genesis for the Torres initiative, has teamed up with a former associate of Mr Ralph Nader, the US consumer activist, to draft a proposal which could be presented to Californian voters next year. 'We're seeing whether we can put something together,' says Mr Tobias. 'We're taking it one step at a time, but the next few months could decide.' Pay-at-the-pump insurance is fairly straightforward. Under the amended Torres bill, for example, Californian drivers would pay an extra 28 cents for every gallon of petrol they buy. In return they would receive a one-off voucher which could be exchanged, via an insurance agent or company, for a basic motor insurance policy. This would provide the holder with medical coverage worth up to Dollars 15,000. There would also be coverage for non-reimbursed lost wages of up to Dollars 12,000 a year for a maximum two-year period. The effective annual cost of this policy for someone clocking up about 15,000 miles a year in a car with average petrol consumption would be in the Dollars 200-Dollars 300 range. The coverage would be in the form of a 'no-fault' policy - in the event of an accident the insurance would be triggered regardless of who was to blame and would cover the policyholder's losses rather than those of anyone injured by the policyholder. Drivers could top up their protection with additional private policies if they wished. The appeal of the Torres proposal is that a greater proportion of drivers in the nation's most populous state would fall into the insurance net. Lengthy legal battles over damages resulting from car accidents - in addition to core medical costs - would also be minimised. There are some problems, however. A 'pay-at-the-pump' scheme could penalise out-of-town drivers who travel longer distances but are statistically better risks than their urban counterparts. It could also encourage drivers to nip across state lines, filling their tanks with cheaper, out-of-state petrol, although California's geography mitigates against this possibility. Some supporters of the plan also suggest that if California goes down this route, other neighbouring states might be encouraged to follow. But the biggest hurdle remains a political one. The California state legislature sent the Torres bill first to the state Senate insurance committee, where it narrowly won approval late last month after amendments designed to make it more palatable to the industry lobby. Unfortunately, it also dictated that the next stop would be the judiciary committee, where trial lawyers have considerable clout. The Californian Trial Lawyers Association has steadfastly opposed any 'no-fault' system. Clearly, such a system would diminish the lawyers' workload. However, the CTLA has always justified its opposition on more ideological grounds - that individuals' rights would be undermined if they were unable to sue for damages beyond basic medical costs. Even Mr Torres' aides admit the legislative odds are against them at this stage, although they take some comfort from the wider industry support which the amendments negotiated at the insurance committee stage have won. 'If you'd asked a few weeks ago, I'd have said this was dead. There's a chance we can get it through judiciary,' said one. If the bill falls, however, the Tobias initiative could emerge as the next line of attack.</p>

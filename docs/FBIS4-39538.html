			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Konovalov: "Just One Day in Paris -- and </F> $0.5 Billion in His Pocket"]    [Text] Brussels-Paris -- The way this is done was  demonstrated by last week's visit to Belgium and France by a  Kyrgyz delegation headed by the president.    Approximately 40 Kyrgyz entrepreneurs and leaders of various  firms and companies flew into Brussels and then into Paris from  Bishkek in the presidential aircraft along with 10 officials.  While the president was engaged in big-league politics, they  insistently sought partners and tried to set up business  contacts and to sign contracts.    The matter hardly got as far as contracts, however, although  Akayev did bring the "new Kyrgyz" with him to no avail. In my  view, he needed these fellow travelers for propaganda purposes  above all. He wanted to show Europe the new form of the Kyrgyz  economy in the flesh so as to convince it that reforms are  taking place in the Republic not just in words but are giving  rise to market structures and a stratum of entrepreneurs  prepared to cooperate on equal terms.    Of course, this is just one of the arguments. The stability  of the national currency -- the som -- and the lowering of the  rate of inflation, which has now stayed below the 5-percent  level for more than one month, proved no less important.    But the main trump card was the carefully elaborated  three-year program for deepening economic reform, which has been  rated highly by international experts. But the decisive  assessment and, accordingly, the size of the funding had to be  determined by a meeting of the World Bank's Consultative Group  on Kyrgyzia, where the program was defended by Akayev himself.    According to preliminary estimates by Kyrgyz specialists, if  that defense succeeded, the delegation could have collected  $350-$400 million from various sources of funding. The result  exceeded expectations. The preferential credits, investments,  and free aid allocated totaled $550 million for the coming  conventional fiscal year (it begins 1 July, so Kyrgyzia managed  to enroll almost at the last moment).    Participating in the meeting, in addition to the organizer,  were representatives of the IMF, the European Bank for  Reconstruction, and Development, the Asian Bank, the Islamic  Bank, and a number of other organizations and donor countries.  The participants' contributions differ in size and terms. A  sizable proportion of the credits, for example, has been  allocated for 40 years with a 10-year deferment and at an almost  symbolic interest rate.    In order to successfully realize the funds allocated and  extend the reforms' funding, serious projects for cooperation  with foreign firms are needed. A whole package of agreements in  this regard was signed in Belgium and France. Kyrgyzia's  proposals elicited considerable interest among businessmen here.    In particular, it is proposed to jointly work deposits of  nonferrous metals, to extract rare-earth elements and bauxites,  to deliver wool and cotton, to produce telecommunications  equipment, to produce uranium, to process agricultural  produce....    In general, emphasis is placed on setting up joint ventures  in Kyrgyzia, which would like to become a supplier of all sorts  of output to Central Asian countries. "We are virtually on the  Great Silk Road," Akayev remarked, "and this is a very  convenient position for winning a market in a vast region."    But Kyrgyzia clearly will not be able to exploit this  opportunity by relying only on its own efforts, and so it is  opening the door wide to cooperation. Of course, potential  partners need reliable guarantees. Many are still scared off by  political and economic instability in the region. Agreements on  mutual protection for investments are one such guarantee.  Another, in Akayev's opinion, is the fact that Kyrgyzia has  joined the "Partnership for Peace" program, which happened at  NATO headquarters in Brussels.    Will Kyrgyzia's participation in the "Partnership for Peace"  program not complicate its relations with Russia, which, as is  known, takes a special, complex approach to this NATO  initiative? This question hovered persistently in the background  at the ceremony at NATO headquarters and was asked at the final  news conference. S. Balanzino, deputy and temporary acting  secretary general of NATO, at once specified that it was a  question not of any terms advanced by Russia but of the  parameters of its participation in the program, which are still  under discussion.    Askar Akayev supported that wording and declared that he  voices full solidarity with the position of Russia, which, in  his opinion, must participate in the program on different  parameters to, let us say, Kyrgyzia or any other CIS country.  Only in this case, he said, will the program play a role in  ensuring peace and security in the CIS.    As for Kyrgyzia, according to Akayev, it is now reckoning on  certain material support from NATO, above all, in conversion.  In his opinion, the possibility of consulting and cooperating  with NATO countries in the event of a threat to the Republic's  territorial integrity will be important.</p>

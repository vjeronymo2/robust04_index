UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) Canadian Lieutenant-Colonel  Bill Aikman said there were reports that Bosnian Serb forces had  attacked near the town of Vrbovik in the northwest part of the  exclusion zone. The report was confirmed by UN military  observers and Canadian reconnaissance troops.    The mainly Moslem Bosnian Army said Serbs had fired  artillery  from within the exclusion zone. Aikman said it was possible the  artillery fire had come from outside the zone and that UN troops  were investigating this.    Aikman said the NATO-mandated artillery withdrawal from in  and around Sarajevo and a ceasefire in effect since February 9  were being generally observed although there were minor  violations.</p>

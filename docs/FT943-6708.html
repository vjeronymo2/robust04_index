			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Man in the News: Plodder with a prototype of reform - Mexico's President Ernesto Zedillo There were two victors in Mexico's presidential elections on Sunday. The official winner was Mr Ernesto Zedillo, a 42-year-old former budget and education minister who overcame his lacklustre image to pull off a convincing victory. The other, with as much at stake, was the current president Carlos Salinas. After one of the most traumatic years in recent Mexican history, he looks set to hand over power to his anointed successor after the cleanest ballot the country has known. Mr Salinas, whose chances at landing the top job at the nascent World Trade Organisation have now risen considerably, insists that his successor deserves credit for the victory. 'He presented a consistent, coherent and clear programme in a very intense campaign that got close to people,' he said in an interview this week. Asked for his judgment on the campaign, Mr Zedillo, betraying his training as a central banker, first qualifies his answer. 'It's necessary to study what happened closely. My opinions are very preliminary and have no scientific basis.' He goes on to credit the strong voter base of his Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) which has ruled Mexico for 65 years, the favourable popular evaluation of the Salinas government and the overall campaign. He mentions himself not at all. Despite the continuity he has promised in economic policy, Mr Zedillo's style is strikingly different from his predecessor's. Mr Salinas, 46, son of a cabinet minister, is a scion of one of Mexico's leading political families. Mr Zedillo, the son of an electrician, rose through state schools to finish his education at Yale. He appears more introverted and modest than his predecessor, but often comes across as abrasive. Mr Zedillo was chosen by Mr Salinas as the ruling party's candidate less than a week after the murder on March 23 of the president's first choice, Luis Donaldo Colosio. Having resigned from the cabinet to become Mr Colosio's campaign manager, Mr Zedillo was the only member of Mr Salinas's inner circle eligible for the nomination; serving ministers were barred from running under a constitution which states that, for a minister to contest the election, he must have resigned at least six months before polling day. Mr Zedillo denies ever having an inkling that he would be president. He first considered the possibility 'the day that I was nominated'. But Mr Zedillo was reported to be the first to arrive at the presidential palace after the assassination, indicating that the thought of becoming president may not have been as far from his mind as he claims. His nomination was opposed by members of the ruling party. A political loner, who counts the solitary pursuit of long-distance running as his hobbies, Mr Zedillo had few allies in the PRI, and some enemies. Most of his supporters in the government were those who like him had doctorates in economics from US universities. But Mr Zedillo has faced criticism from a broader front. Mr Enrique Krauze, a prominent historian, last week described Mr Zedillo as being 'an honourable man, an intelligent economist and a workaholic. Unfortunately he is also a man of narrow cultural horizons and vision'. Mr Krauze, like many Mexicans, was scornful of Mr Zedillo's effort when as education minister he revised Mexico's outdated school history textbooks. The new books were withdrawn after criticism that they diminished the role of Mexico's nationalist heroes, and were riddled with errors. Mr Zedillo dismisses these criticisms as inventions of the chattering classes who are out of touch with the real Mexico. 'I say that there are two Mexicos. One Mexico of the common people. And a Mexico of the cafes of Mexico City. The real Mexico is the first one, the one that is most representative.' Such a view of Mexican society appears to shape Mr Zedillo's approach to political affairs. He appears convinced that the importance of the New Year peasant uprising in Chiapas - in which several Mayan Indians seized half a dozen towns and declared war on the government of President Salinas - has been exaggerated by the national and foreign press. 'The people who spend all their time in Mexico, who understand its problems, have a more balanced vision of what is going on here.' Mr Salinas, for his part, concedes the Chiapas uprising pushed him into making far-reaching democratic reforms, in an effort to undercut popular support for the rebels. 'The events of Chiapas might well have provoked a political clampdown, and it was an option that we had. But we decided the opposite, to open more to political competition and to advances in democracy. Taking the more democratic route was a greater risk. But better the risk of democracy than the risk of stalemate,' said President Salinas. With the election over, Mr Zedillo has promised to deepen the democratic reforms that Mr Salinas belatedly embraced. He says this is his central aim and one on which he is seeking a broad consensus with political opponents. Mr Zedillo said he will also co-operate with the opposition to advance reform of the judiciary, wider social policies and further economic liberalisation. He has also pledged to make the organisation which manages the elections independent of the government, to push for more equal campaign conditions for political parties in future elections, a thorough reform of the PRI, and a devolution of powers to states and municipalities. Many Mexicans are sceptical of these promises. They point to his expensive campaign, in which he far outspent the opposition, and the use of PRI-affiliated unions to compel workers to attend his rallies, as signs that his commitment to democracy is questionable. If he proves his critics wrong and carries through his promises of democratic changes, Mr Zedillo will be voluntarily yielding powers which President Salinas used to the full. Mr Zedillo has implied that unlike his predecessor he will not pick PRI candidates for elected positions, nor fire state governors that have outlived their usefulness to him; he would give independence to the judiciary, and allow Congress powers to scrutinise legislation. For some Mexicans, the manner in which Mr Salinas wielded presidential power, often with little regard for constitutional and legal constraints, is his most damaging legacy. By betting that economic growth would disarm political opposition, Mr Salinas 'ignored the political side of the equation', says Mr Luis Rubio, a political scientist. 'Many of the ways in which he solved problems were destructive of the institutions of the country.' For all the criticism of Mr Zedillo's plodding style, his supporters say that he is committed to strengthening Mexico's democratic, legal and local government institutions. This, says Mr Rubio, is just what it needs and would mark a fundamental change with the past: 'If there's a prototype of the person to do this, it is Mr Zedillo.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Andrey Kokoshin, Russian first deputy </F> defense minister, by Mayak observer Viktor Levin on 8 May; place  not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Levin] Victory Day is a great holiday. How are the  Armed Forces celebrating it and what does this holiday mean for  them?    [Kokoshin] Of course, they are celebrating the holiday in a  solemn manner, in accordance with the rituals that have taken  shape in the Soviet Army and those new ones that have appeared  in the Russian Army. Our pre-revolutionary army traditions are  being vigorously revived in symbols and in the traditions of  officers' assemblies.    But what I regard as extremely important is the spirit of  victory and of victors. You know, we need the spirit of 1945  today, too, but in peaceful life. We need much more  self-confidence and we must believe that we will create a  powerful and prosperous economy with armed forces that  correspond to our needs, armed forces that would be part of a  civil democratic society. These armed forces will be powerful  enough to be formidable, while posing a threat to nobody. I  think that herein lies, perhaps, the meaning of our great  holiday of Victory Day which, I am sure, will be celebrated 100,  200, 300, and even 500 years from now, because this was our  country's and people's hour of true glory. This was a great day  of victory over the darkest forces of Nazism that ever existed  in human history. I hope this will never be forgotten. Ours is  a long-suffering people but by its sufferings it redeemed the  fate of today's developed and prosperous states, and we should  be one of them.</p>

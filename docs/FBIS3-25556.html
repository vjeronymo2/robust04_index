The 30 men, who were caught last Thursday with guerrilla  training manuals in their possession, were repatriated under  heavy military guard and placed in a high security prison. They  had been on their way to Libya, the sources added.    Sierra Leonean officials here refused to comment on the  reports.    The military junta in power since April 1992 has been facing  rebel insurgency in southeastern Sierra Leone. After making  amnesty offers, it in January declared "total war" against Foday  Sankoh's guerrillas.</p>

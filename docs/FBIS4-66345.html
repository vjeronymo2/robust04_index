			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Yong: ``Motorola Homing In on Beeper </F> Market'']    [Text] The U.S. telecommunications giant Motorola is to  increase its production of beepers in China in order to tap the  potential of the local market. ``We will expand production by  at least 50 percent this year,'' said K.Y. Chan, sales director  of Motorola's North Asia Paging Products Group.    There is plenty of room for expansion in China. This is  because there are 400 million city dwellers in the country but  only 10 million pagers. In developed countries, on the other  hand, 12 out of 100 people have pagers.    In 1992, Motorola invested more than $100 million into its  manufacturing base in Tianjin City, North China. And so far,  the plant has churned out more than 1 million beepers priced at  1000 yuan ($115) each.    ``There are about 3 million Motorola pagers in use in China  at present, if imports from Singapore are included,'' Chan said.  Singapore is the leading manufacturing base of Motorola in the  Asia-Pacific region, providing nearly all the pagers which  display information with Chinese characters. But towards the  end of the year the Tianjin base will also start producing  pagers with Chinese characters, said Chan. He did not say how  many such pagers will be produced per year in the future.    Motorola's biggest potential rivals in China include Japan's  NEC and some Chinese manufacturers from Guangdong Province in  the South. The American company has captured a third of the  Chinese pager market. And the multinational firm has also  cornered more than half of the global market which requires 15  million beepers a year.    ``Motorola's top three markets are the U.S., Japan and  China,  and we are anticipating a bigger local production in China,''  said Chan.    Motorola staged a sales promotion campaign in Beijing  recently, selling more than 23,000 pagers.    Statistics show that the number of China's pagers increased  by 152 percent in 1993 over the previous year. And the  country's telecommunications market has grown rapidly, said Liu  Cai, head of the policy department of the Ministry of Posts &amp;  Telecommunications. But he admitted that telephone systems,  particularly mobile [phones] and beepers, are still in their  infancy in China. By the year 2000, China will have more than 5  million mobile phones, he said.    And the number of pagers is expected to boom during the same  period. Pagers will become one of the most sought-after consumer  goods in the 1990s, an official said.</p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GANG WARS BRING SORROWS TO SCHOOL TURF;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: RECENT VIOLENCE IS PROMPTING SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS TO HEIGHTEN  SECURITY AND CALL IN PSYCHOLOGISTS TO COUNSEL FRIGHTENED STUDENTS.  </P> <P> Just months after a state report showed a decline in school crime, one  gang-related death and a spate of arrests and confrontations at or near area  schools have raised concerns that gang turf wars are bleeding from San Gabriel  Valley streets onto school campuses.  </P> <P> In districts from Pasadena to Rowland Heights to Pomona, concern over school  safety has prompted administrators to beef up security, cancel a varsity  football game, bring in psychologists to counsel students and form task forces  to study campus violence.  </P> <P> But administrators say it is often difficult to prevent incidents that occur  off campus, even if they involve students. Earlier this year, for instance,  there were several shootings close to Pomona schools, an official from Pomona  Unified said.  </P> <P> Oct. 16, a 12-year-old boy from Marshall Junior High School, whom Pomona  officials described as a "wanna-be" who hung out with gang members, was shot in  the head and killed, apparently by a member of an opposing gang, as he rode  home from school in the back of a pickup truck.  </P> <P> No one has been arrested. The murder has traumatized students at the school,  prompting the district to bring in psychologists to counsel the children.  </P> <P> "Because we live in L.A. County and because society is what it is today, none  of us are exempt from being exposed to that kind of violence," said Linda  Harding, principal of Los Altos High School.  </P> <P> The Hacienda Heights school had its own brush with violence late last month  when a student from a rival high school was arrested at a football game,  carrying a loaded gun.  </P> <P> Pasadena, which showed a drop in overall school crimes last year, according to  the state report, has been hit by a number of potentially violent incidents in  recent weeks. Students, parents and teachers feel especially vulnerable, since  district cutbacks recently slashed security by half.  </P> <P> At Tuesday's board meeting, parents asked for increased security at Pasadena  Alternative School, which lost its only security guard this year due to the  budget cuts.  </P> <P> "I don't want to wait until something really bad happens," said Patty Sedlacko,  whose children attend Pasadena Alternative.  </P> <P> Several incidents at Pasadena schools in recent weeks underscore her concern.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, two young men entered a classroom at Blair High School,  interrupted teacher Allen Perlstein and refused to leave when he asked them to.  Pasadena officials say the two, who were not students, shouted gang-related  slogans at class members before abruptly leaving. But they returned a few  minutes later and demanded to be let in, pounding violently on the classroom  door, which Perlstein had quickly locked.  </P> <P> Perlstein, a 20-year veteran of Pasadena Unified, said he felt "absolutely  endangered" by the young men, whose breath reeked of alcohol. He wrote a letter  to the board, which read in part:  </P> <P> "I will not give up my life nor my health because this financially strapped  school district is having budget problems. Your students as well as your  employees have a right to a safe, clean, sane environment and a quality  education."  </P> <P> In a second confrontation at Blair, Pasadena officials say a teacher and some  students attending a "Back to School Night" in September were harassed and  intimidated by two young men. The men refused the teacher's request that they  leave and eventually were escorted off campus by security officers.  </P> <P> Pasadena officials say they have requested help from the Pasadena Police  Department and that both the police and the district's own security are  maintaining a higher profile on high school campuses during school hours.  </P> <P> After an uproar among parents and at school over the Blair incidents, Pasadena  assigned two additional officers to that school "to make sure outsiders do not  penetrate the campus," said Charles W. Parcell, administrative chief of campus  police for Pasadena Unified.  </P> <P> The district is also studying long-range plans that could include bringing  off-duty police officers onto campus and shifting some of the district's night  security to daytime duty, said John Porter, the district's director of  secondary instruction.  </P> <P> Other districts have also taken steps to ward off gang activity. Earlier this  year, Pomona Unified launched a day patrol of five armed security officers. The  patrol is districtwide, but focuses on junior high and high school campuses.  </P> <P> In addition, the district long ago moved football games out of Pomona, to Mt.  San Antonio College in Walnut. That campus is patrolled by L.A. County  sheriff's deputies and the college's own security.  </P> <P> Last month, after security officers at Hacienda La Puente Unified arrested a  16-year-old Nogales High School student carrying a loaded gun at a football  game, the district canceled one game and decided to increase the number of  off-duty deputies at future football games.  </P> <P> It has also set up fences to separate members of opposing schools, figuring  that it will lower the risk for violence if it minimizes interaction between  them.  </P></p>

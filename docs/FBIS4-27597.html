			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 29 (YONHAP) -- The United People's Party  (UPP) and the New Political Reform Party (NPRP) will merge into  one on Monday.    UPP leader Kim Tong-kil and NPRP leader Pak Chan-chong will  have a joint press conference at the National Assembly Monday  morning to announce their union.    Kim and Pak will say that their union does not mean giving  up  full-scale union of the opposition parties, but it is rather a  first stage aiming at union of all the opposition parties in the  future, including the main opposition Democratic Party and New  Korea Party.    The unified party, whose name is not decided yet, will also  try to admit independent lawmakers to be a formal negotiating  body in the National Assembly.    Now UPP has 12 lawmakers and NPRP has one, so according to  the rules of the National Assembly, the unified party will be  able to be a negotiating body if seven lawmakers join it in  addition.</p>

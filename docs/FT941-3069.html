			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: London-Shanghai SE move closer The London and Shanghai stock exchanges yesterday agreed to work towards the listing of Chinese companies abroad as part of increased co-operation between the two markets. Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the London stock exchange, signed a memorandum of understanding with his Shanghai counterpart aimed at facilitating technical contacts. Sir Andrew said that these contacts would assist in bringing closer the regulatory procedures of the two exchanges. Among issues being discussed was the trading of Shanghai stocks on the London market. Shanghai Petrochemical, which was listed abroad simultaneously in Hong Kong and New York last year, is being traded in London. Sir Andrew, who has been addressing seminars in Beijing and Shanghai organised by the China-Britain Trade Group, said that he could foresee British companies seeking listings in Shanghai. The timing would depend, he said, on further de-regulation of the foreign exchange market. China has not yet moved to full convertibility for the yuan. Shanghai is one of two stock exchanges in China. The other is located in the Shenzen Special Economic Zone adjacent to Hong Kong. There are plans for a third, possibly in the Yangtze river town of Wuhan.</p>

			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 29-YEAR-OLD TOPPER THE GIRAFFE PUT TO SLEEP; AT ZOO SINCE 1962  </P> <P> Topper, a 29-year-old Uganda giraffe, died Monday at the San Diego Zoo when his  chronic foot problems prompted veterinarians to put him to sleep.  </P> <P> The death of Topper leaves Checkers, one of his two longtime mates, as the only  Uganda giraffe at the zoo, although three Masai giraffes -- a different  subspecies -- live in an adjoining enclosure.  </P> <P> Topper was brought to San Diego at the age of 2 in mid-October, 1962, after  being caught in Kenya. With Checkers and another mate, Freckles, who died in  1984, the 18-foot-tall giraffe sired 21 children, many of whom have populated  zoos throughout the world.  </P> <P> His son Blackjack was for years the Wild Animal Park's breeding male giraffe.  He died in 1987 at the age of 17.  </P> <P> Topper, who suffered from painful foot problems, on Monday afternoon was  visited by several of his longtime keepers. He then was led into the giraffe  barn, where veterinarians injected him with a lethal dose of a sedative. The  giraffe collapsed onto hay bales, put in place to cushion his fall.  </P> <P> Topper will be cremated at the zoo after an autopsy. LORI GRANGE  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Mainayev] </F>   [Text] Bishkek 10 June TASS -- Kirghiz [Kyrgyz] President  Askar Akayev spoke about promised credits to his country with a  radiant smile just a few weeks ago. However, his smile  disappeared a few days ago after he completed his visit to  Belgium and France on 4 June.    "I told the leadership of the European Community Commission  (ECC)," Akayev said at a meeting with journalists after the  European visit, "that their stiff conditions and interest rates  are neck-breaking for the Republic."    The president called the ECC credit "holdup of a beggar." He  told virtually the same to Indian foreign minister who visited  Bishkek this week. The only difference was that he described  the deplorable situation of his country.    The president said that Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan] does not  enjoy  the same rating as neighbouring Central Asian countries, adding  "Turkmenia [Turkmenistan], for instance, is wallowing in  petrodollars. The Turkmen president is building a palace worth  400 million U.S. dollars.    "On the other hand, I could only scratch $500 million all  over Europe for a three-year programme for reforming the  Republic," he stressed.    Kazakhstan, Akayev continued, leads the entire continent in  the production of non-ferrous metals and is a member of the  nuclear pool. Uzbekistan has large deposits of gas and oil. It  annually produces over 100 tonnes of gold and harvests millions  of tonnes of cotton.    Kirghizia is a poor country, the president repeated: 98 per  cent of all energy resources are imported by it at prices which  are 50 per cent higher than on world markets.    Akayev told journalists that he has been persuading the  organisation for economic cooperation and development for two  years to put the republic on the list of developing countries,  since it needs easy-term credits to be repaid by instalments.    "We are a small but proud people," he added. "If we take a  loan, we should be sure that we shall pay it in time."</p>

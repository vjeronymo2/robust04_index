			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OPERATIONS BEING PHASED OUT AT ENCINO BRANCH  COURT BUILDING  </P> <P> Operations at the Encino branch court building, a former grocery store plagued  by a sagging roof supported by 66 posts, will begin to be phased out Monday.  </P> <P> Small claims cases, formerly heard at the facility, will be handled at the new  10-story Van Nuys Municipal Court building at 14400 Erwin St. beginning next  week, officials said.  </P> <P> The court will continue to hear other civil matters until mid-July, when the  building's doors will be closed for good, said Peggy Shuttleworth, chief of the  court's Van Nuys division. All of the court's business will then be transferred  to the new Van Nuys facility.  </P> <P> Workers and visitors at the Encino branch in the 5700 block of White Oak Avenue  have had to maneuver around the support posts, which were installed in 1986  after the demolition of two neighboring structures caused the building's roof  to sag, Shuttleworth said.  </P></p>

Figueroa B.] </F>   [Text] Ernesto Perez Balladares, PRD [Democratic  Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate, yesterday charged  that a campaign is being waged by official parties to link his  political group to acts of violence. In addition, Perez  Balladares denied at a news conference that Argelis Chavez --  accused by Arnulfists of aggression -- is a PRD member.    The Arnulfist Party [PA] National Directorate reiterated  that  its presidential candidate, Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, was  attacked in Puerto Armuelles on Saturday by a woman who had a  PRD flag in her hands. The PA warned it will not remain passive  in light of the mounting violence aimed at it.    During the PRD news conference Perez Balladares presented  Chavez indicating she did not belong to his party, rather, she  was registered as a member of the Christian Democratic Party  (PDC), from which she had recently resigned. The presidential  candidate also said that Chavez currently works with Ricardo  Perez Colman, a PDC legislator, who confirmed her resignation.    During the news conference, Argelis Chavez acknowledged she  had a stick in her hand but it was not to attack the PA  candidate, rather it was to "whack her little brother" who had  strayed off.    Perez Balladares charged there are political parties, which  he did not identify, that are paying some individuals to carry  PRD signs and to provoke incorrect actions to make the party  appear violent. "We have had to carry the blame for violent  actions that brought mourning to the nation; this still bothers  us. Nevertheless, we have made an effort because we know that  the country deserves better proposals," he underlined.    Meanwhile, Fernando Arias, from the PA, said they have been  the victims of the attacks and that the Puerto Armuelles case  has been confirmed by at least six persons.</p>

			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT DENIES BAIL FOR COLOMBIA DRUG SUSPECT  </P> <P> Accused Colombian drug financier Eduardo Martinez Romero was ordered jailed  without bail Monday after he pleaded innocent to charges of laundering huge  sums of cocaine money that led to his extradition to the United States.  </P> <P> U.S. Magistrate Joel M. Feldman, in denying a request that Martinez be held  under house arrest rather than his current solitary confinement, ruled that  defense lawyers failed to answer government arguments that he could resume  supervising money laundering for the Medellin drug cartel and should be  regarded as dangerous.  </P> <P> Martinez is the first accused Colombian drug figure extradited to the United  States since his country's anti-drug crackdown began more than three weeks ago.  </P> <P> Although the defendant had never been charged with a crime, was a government  budget director and is a family man, Feldman emphasized that money laundering  "oils the machine" of drug distribution and is more serious than a mere series  of alleged illegal financial transactions.  </P> <P> The 36-year-old Martinez is accused of laundering at least $15 million in U.S.  banks and of being the financial expert behind efforts to hide $1.2 billion in  drug profits earned by the Medellin cartel, which is believed responsible for  80% of the cocaine smuggled into this country.  </P> <P> Martinez was extradited from Colombia under heavy guard last Thursday. His  lawyer had objected that a U.S. court has no jurisdiction over him.  </P> <P> Martinez could receive life in prison under U.S. law, compared to 30 years  under Colombian law.  </P></p>

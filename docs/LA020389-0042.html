			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 MAJOR SOCIAL BILLS OFF TO FAST START;  </P> <P> BACKERS CHALLENGE 'KINDER' BUSH TO FAVOR BLOCKED LEGISLATION  </P> <P> Congressional backers of major social legislation that was blocked by  Republican-led filibusters last fall are challenging President Bush to show his  "kinder, gentler" side by quickly endorsing an increase in the federal minimum  wage, a family and medical leave bill and a compromise child care bill.  </P> <P> Pushed by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), chairman of the Senate Labor and  Human Resources Committee, and several key Republicans, the three measures are  off to a fast start in the new session of Congress.  </P> <P> Backers said they expect Bush to give positive signals on the legislation next  Thursday when he will go to Capitol Hill to announce his program and revisions  in the budget submitted by former President Ronald Reagan last month.  </P> <P> Even without Bush's support, however, the prospects for passage of some  variations of the three measures were regarded as better than they have been in  years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Less Ideological President'  </P> <P> "We are out of a very strong ideological period (under Ronald Reagan), and we  have a less ideological President, judging by his Cabinet appointments,"  Kennedy said in an interview.  </P> <P> The measures last year were blocked by conservatives who charged they would add  to business costs, cause elimination of some jobs and make U.S. businesses less  competitive.  </P> <P> Introducing a family and medical leave bill Thursday, Sen. Christopher J. Dodd  (D-Conn.) said it was essential to provide a way for working parents to take  time off for family and medical emergencies without losing their jobs.  </P> <P> "This is an idea whose time has come," Dodd said. Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.)  indirectly prodded Bush by saying: "We are trying to provide a kinder, gentler  atmosphere in this country."  </P> <P> Rep. Marge Roukemma (R-N.J.), sponsor of a similar bill in the House, added:  "Republicans must go beyond lip service in our devotion to family values" and  predicted at least tacit support of the measure by the Bush Administration.  </P> <P> Dodd's bill would require employers of 20 or more workers to grant up to 10  weeks of unpaid leave in event of childbirth, adoption or serious illness of a  child. It would require up to 13 weeks of unpaid time off in the event of an  employee's serious illness.  </P> <P> Kennedy said another bill to raise the $3.35-an-hour minimum wage to $4.65 an  hour in three steps would be approved next Wednesday by his committee, in the  hope that Bush would take a position soon and the Senate then could be "ready  for action" in March.  </P> <P> A similar measure -- but with a $4.55 maximum rate -- was blocked by a  filibuster in the Senate after Reagan threatened to veto the bill. It still  faces massive opposition from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business  groups.  </P> <P> While Bush called for a higher minimum wage in the election campaign, he has  not mentioned a figure and said it would have to be accompanied by a "training  wage" below the proposed rate for new workers -- a feature strongly opposed by  organized labor.  </P> <P> "We will increase the minimum wage in this Congress," Kennedy said in an  interview. "I hope we'll do it with the Administration's support, but we can do  without it, if necessary."  </P> <P> Kennedy already has met with Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and previewed  his legislative timetable with White House officials in hopes that the  Administration will prepare alternatives to bills marked for fast-track  consideration in the Senate.  </P> <P> After the minimum wage bill and the family and medical leave bill, the Senate  Labor Committee hopes to get bipartisan agreement on more controversial child  care legislation. In this area, Bush is expected to endorse use of the tax code  to allocate payments of up to $1,000 to working parents for day care of their  children. Dodd, with some backing from key conservative Sen. Orrin G. Hatch  (R-Utah), has proposed a program costing up to $2.5 billion a year that would  establish federal standards for child care centers as well as channel federal  funds to lower-income working families.  </P> <P> Asked where the funds would be found for expanded social programs in view of  the massive federal deficit, Kennedy said that if Bush drops the idea of  increasing the defense budget by 2% after offsetting any inflation, it would  free $8 billion for other purposes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TESTING BUSH'S 'KINDER, GENTLER' VISION  </P> <P>  Highlights of three major bills being readied by Democrats and Republican  allies for early congressional action this year:  </P> <P> MINIMUM WAGE -- An increase from the present $3.35 hourly rate to $4.65 in  three stages, with an exemption for smaller business firms and adjustments in  the tip credit allowed for hotel and restaurant owners. Senate Labor Committee  approval expected next week.  </P> <P> FAMILY, MEDICAL LEAVE -- Requires firms with more than 20 employees (50  employees in the House version) to provide up to 10 weeks of unpaid leave to  workers with more than a year's service in case of childbirth, adoption or  serious illness of a child or elderly parent. Introduced in Senate Thursday.  </P> <P> CHILD CARE -- Authorizes $2.5 billion a year to aid low-income working families  with child care expenses and sets minimum health and safety standards for child  care programs supported by public funds. Introduced in Senate last month.  </P></p>

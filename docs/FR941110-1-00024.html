New Jersey's program will apply to employers with 100 or more employees who arrive at the workplace between the hours of 6 and 10 a.m. The goal of this program is to increase the average passenger occupancies (APO) by 25% above the average for vehicles arriving at the workplace. This would decrease the amount of automobiles arriving at the workplace, and therefore, decrease the VMT.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New Jersey submitted a SIP revision on November 15, 1993 that contained an adopted ECO program. EPA is proposing to approve the State's ECO program as a carbon monoxide contingency measure since it is an adopted measure which will serve to reduce VMT. However, EPA will be taking action on the ECO program submittal as a requirement of the ozone SIP in a separate  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice since there are specific requirements an ECO program must meet for an ozone SIP but not for a carbon monoxide SIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Statewide Enhanced Inspection and Maintenance Program <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  New Jersey also submitted this program as a revision for its ozone SIP, and it is identical to that required by section 187(a)(6) of the Act (see section on enhanced inspection and maintenance program earlier in this notice). Since the program is being established on a state-wide basis, carbon monoxide reductions derived from outside of the Northeastern New Jersey nonattainment area will have a benefit in the carbon monoxide nonattainment areas and could be used for contingency purposes. Once adopted, the enhanced inspection and maintenance program will act as an additional contingency measure should the VMT forecast be exceeded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> TCMs  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Act requires states in carbon monoxide non-attainment areas to develop VMT forecasts. In addition, states must develop TCMs that will be used as contingency measures in the event that the VMT forecast included in the 1992 carbon monoxide SIP is exceeded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New Jersey's SIP submittal includes TCMs as contingency measures. These TCMs are incorporated into three major program areas, which includes traffic flow improvements, park &amp; ride lots, and increased ridesharing. EPA proposes to approve these TCMs as viable contingency measures to offset excess growth in VMT.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposes to approve the ECO program as an adequate contingency measure for failure to attain the carbon monoxide standard. While New Jersey identified two contingency measures should the VMT forecast be exceeded, only one measure was adopted. EPA proposes to approve the TCMs as an adequate contingency measure for exceeding the VMT forecast. Once the enhanced inspection and maintenance program is adopted, it will act as an additional contingency measure should further carbon monoxide reductions be necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Carbon Monoxide Emission Inventory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> New Jersey submitted a comprehensive carbon monoxide emission inventory on November 15, 1992 as required by section 187(a)(1) and as described in section 172(c)(3) of the Act. Additional inventory information was submitted on January 12, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The emission inventory represents a comprehensive, actual inventory of all carbon monoxide emission sources in the nonattainment areas. It includes emissions from point, area, and mobile sources (see 1990 base year carbon monoxide emissions summary in Tables 1 and 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The inventory was developed according to EPA guidance and has been quality assured. Sources that emit in excess of 100 tons per year of carbon monoxide are defined as point sources. Stationary sources that emit below this threshold are too small to be considered point sources and are, therefore, considered to be area sources. The area and off-highway mobile sources include such categories as stationary source fuel combustion, aircraft, marine vessels, and railroads. Highway mobile source emissions were calculated using EPA's MOBILE 4.1 model. Input parameters to this model included VMT, speed, temperature, and registration distribution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposes to approve New Jersey's 1990 base year emission inventory for carbon monoxide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, it should be noted that New Jersey may be undertaking a revised analysis of its attainment demonstration and emissions budget based on more recent traffic information now being developed. EPA would evaluate, in a future  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice, any additional information provided by New Jersey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

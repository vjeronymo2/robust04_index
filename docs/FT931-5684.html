			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Money Markets: An important day INTEREST RATE futures in Europe rose again yesterday as dealers continued to assume that the Bundesbank would cut Germany's discount rate at its council meeting today, writes James Blitz. There was one clear sign yesterday that the Bundesbank was happy to see monetary policy relax a little. The central bank drained a net DM2.4bn from the banking system when accepting bids for this week's allocation of funds. The draining was rather less than the market had expected, following the addition of DM32bn of funds through the relaxation of minimum reserve requirements at the start of the week. Taking the recent issue of short-term bills into account, a net DM15bn of funds has been added to the system. This helped German call money down to 8.59 per cent yesterday, from 9 per cent earlier in the week. Three-month money dropped to 8.18 per cent. Both of these moves helped the March Euromark contract to climb 8 basis points to a close of 92.04. But the contract's rise also clearly assumed that the official discount rate will be cut today, because it is pricing three-month money at 7.96 per cent when the contract expires in 10 days' time. The market's assumption is that the discount floor, now at 8.00 per cent, will be lowered. Both the growing recession in Germany and recent money supply figures showing a net drop in M3 growth underline the possibility that the central bank council might ease policy today. But the Bundesbank may await the results of talks on a Solidarity Pact between the German government, oppo-sition and trade unions before moving rates. The March French franc contract was unchanged at 88.60. But the June contract advanced 10 basis points to finish at 93.12, reflect-ing assumptions that French rates must come down by the summer. The March short sterling contract gained 8 basis points yesterday, ending at 94.07. It was helped by the Bundes-bank's money market oper-ations and a monthly report by the UK Treasury suggesting that the UK economy should show signs of recovery this year. Three-month sterling cash firmed  1/16 percentage point to 6 1/16 per cent because of difficulties removing a shortage of Pounds 1.95bn forecast by the Bank of England.</p>

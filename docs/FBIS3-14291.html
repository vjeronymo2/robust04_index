			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 24 Mar (MENA)--Terry Larsen, Norwegian deputy  foreign minister and chairman of a conference on providing  material aid for the Palestinian police force, has stated that  it has been decided to form a committee of representatives from  the PLO, Israel, the United States, Egypt, Japan, Russia,  Norway, and the European Union to discuss the mechanism for  providing aid for the Palestinian police force, which will be  formed in accordance with the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of  Principles.    Larsen stated this in a joint news conference today attended  by Dennis Ross, the U.S. coordinator for the Middle East peace  talks; Victor Posuvalyuk, President Yeltsin's envoy to the  Middle East; Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian  delegation; Uri Savir, director general of the Israeli Foreign  Ministry; and Ambassador Husayn Dirar from the Egyptian Foreign  Ministry. The committee held its first meeting after the news  conference.    Larsen said the Israelis and Palestinians agreed on the  entry  of the police force to the autonomous regions and that the  international community must support this force.    Dennis Ross said the United States will send 200 vehicles  for  the police force within two weeks.    Sha'th said the World Bank has estimated how much money the  police force will need. An initial sum of $47 million is needed  for the force. The final cost will be around $90 million  annually. He noted that part of this cost can be met in the  form of material aid. Some donor states have actually promised  to give this aid.    Larsen said the amount to be given by the donor states has  not been decided yet. He noted that envoys from the PLO and  Norway will visit the donor states to urge them to give aid soon.    At the start of the news conference, Larsen delivered a  statement saying that Norway called for this urgent session  after consulting with the parties concerned with the peace  process to coordinate the aid to be given to establish the  Palestinian police force in accordance with the  Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles and after Israel  and the PLO agreed on the early entry of the Palestinian police  force to safeguard the safety and security of the Palestinians  in the occupied territories.    Larsen explained that the Israeli and Palestinian sides have  affirmed their commitment to the peace process and have  discussed the progress made regarding the formation of the  police force. The Palestinian side has also discussed the  force's needs in terms of equipment, telecommunications,  clothes, and housing. The donor states also told the meeting  what they can give to the Palestinian police force. He said  that during the meeting, emphasis was placed on the quick  handing over of missions to the Palestinian police. The PLO  explained the need for the right coordination and mechanism in  handing over such missions.    Asked about the funds allocated for the Palestinian police  force, Larsen said he cannot state the amounts before  delegations from Norway and the PLO visit the donor states.    Asked about the date of the deployment of the Palestinian  force in Gaza and Jericho, Sha'th said: We are discussing  preparations for the deployment of the Palestinian force as soon  as possible. He said he hoped deployment would take place on  the date specified in the Declaration of Principles--13 April.  He also said he hoped a Palestinian force would be dispatched  earlier to prepare for the self-rule authority in Gaza and  Jericho.    Sha'th said a Palestinian police force will deploy in Hebron  but this will be outside the framework of the Gaza-Jericho  talks. Agreement on this police force for Hebron will be reached  within the framework of the current talks in Cairo.    Asked about the armament of the Palestinian police force in  Hebron, Sha'th said the police will carry personal weapons. He  said no agreement has been reached on heavy weapons, such as  machine guns. So we ask the donor states to finance what was  agreed upon -- light weapons, houses for the police force,  telecommunications equipment, and transport vehicles. He noted  that Norway has delivered 3,000 police uniforms and promised to  send another 7,000 uniforms soon.    Uri Savir, director of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, said:  During the previous talks on Gaza and Jericho we were very close  to reaching an agreement on the arrangements for the police  force. We must now reach agreement on the police force outside  Gaza and Jericho. He said: We discussed the gradual arrival of  the Palestinian police force before the handover of the  self-rule authority in Gaza and Jericho.    Larsen declined to answer a question on the absence of Saudi  Arabia and Kuwait from the meeting.    Asked about the deployment of a Palestinian police force in  Hebron, Sha'th said this was the result of the ugly massacre in  the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. He noted that negotiations are under  way with the Israeli side on the size of this force.    Commenting on the same issue, Savir said: We are still  discussing the issue of the police force in Hebron. In the  event of an agreement, this force will be a step on the road  toward achieving security and stability for the Palestinians.  There are some details that are still under discussion.    Asked about his tour of the region, Dennis Ross said his  talks with the parties concerned with the peace process were  good. The parties affirmed their commitment to establishing a  just and comprehensive peace in the region. He noted that the  meeting in Cairo today indicates that the Israelis want to  establish an atmosphere of confidence.    Dennis Ross said: I can say now that April will be the date  for resuming the Palestinian-Israeli talks. He noted that he is  holding talks with the Russian side on resuming these talks.    On the Russian role in the region, President Yeltsin's envoy  said: We have reasons for our increasing interest in the Middle  East. The region is our neighbor. We are interested in  establishing strong relations with it. We have important  economic interests in the region. Many Soviet Jews have  emigrated to Israel. He stressed that his country will take  steps to strengthen its relations with the Arab states.    The Palestinian and Israeli sides expressed their gratitude  to Egypt and Norway for helping them convene this meeting  despite the short notice. They also thanked the cosponsors of  the conference, the United States and Russia, whose  participation on this high level is significant for all the  sides.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] The national council of the biggest  opposition party, the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], held a  session today. Party Chairman Ivan Petoe made a submission on  the list of deputies and Gabor Kuncze, leader of the party's  parliamentary group and the party's candidate for prime  minister, on the coalition guidelines. Our staff member Peter  Obersovszky spoke to Gabor Kuncze. [passage omitted]    [Begin recording] [Obersovszky] In recent days the SZDSZ  signed the liberal election agreement. [passage omitted] Many  people feel that the most problematic situation would be if the  Hungarian Socialist Party [HSP] got about 30 percent and would  then be in a position to choose its coalition partners or to  start forming a government. What would happen then? The SZDSZ  has very many times been accused, explicitly or implicitly, that  it is potentially willing to form a coalition with the HSP.    [Kuncze] It is worth repeating what we said at the SZDSZ's  last delegates' assembly, that whereas on the one hand we strive  to see the present coalition replaced, on the other hand we  would not even dream of helping the HSP to victory. I also  doubt whether it could get 30 percent.    But there is another viewpoint here, the viewpoint of the  country's governability. It would not be a good thing if it  turned out to be impossible to form a coalition after May and  new elections had to be called. That is why we laid down our  coalition guidelines. On the basis of these we are open to  negotiations. The electorate can also see what kind of  coalition the SZDSZ is willing to enter into, and we will be  accountable on these points.    However, at this stage it is not worth saying any more than  this with regard to the HSP, or any other parties. For the time  being there exists but one agreement: this is at the center, the  agreement of the liberal parties. [passage omitted] [end  recording]</p>

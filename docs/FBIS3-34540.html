He  added that the only way to achieve peace is by negotiating and  putting pressure on the Bosnian Muslims to make concessions and  to bargain. Hamilton added that refraining from exerting such  pressure will mean continued fighting in the former Yugoslav  republics.    Hamilton's remarks are the clearest indication of the U.S.  diplomatic posture on the Bosnian crisis. They reveal the truth  about official U.S. policy regarding the civil war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Until now, Washington's public policy has been to condemn  Serbian actions and at one point it accused the Belgrade  government of assaulting Bosnia-Herzegovina's national  sovereignty and territorial integrity. Still, throughout two  years of fighting and brutal Serbian aggression, followed by  Croatian aggression, against Bosnian lives, wealth, and  sanctity, it became evident to all neutral observers and  analysts that the United States was consistently supporting  Serbian superiority in Bosnia.    The United States has always worried about the rise of an  Islamic government in the heart of Europe. Over the past two  years, ever since Bosnia-Herzegovina attained nominal  independence in the winter of 1991 and became a UN member,  Washington has sought to pursue methods that would progressively  weaken Sarajevo's government. Although Cyrus Vance was a UN  envoy seeking to solve the Bosnian crisis, he was also a U.S.  politician and for this reason evidently acted in line with U.S.  diplomatic guidelines regarding this issue. He always supported  and advocated Bosnia's partition and annexing the Serbian part  to a Greater Serbia and the Croatian part to Croatia. He wanted  a solution to partition Bosnia-Herzegovina into seven or ten  isolated Islamic enclaves amid Serbian and Croatian areas. He  made efforts to push through this solution at the New York and  Geneva conferences. This is in line with the spirit and logic  of U.S. policy on the crisis in this European republic. It is  for this reason that we said at the beginning of this talk that  Hamilton's remarks were truthful and reflected the political  facts.</p>

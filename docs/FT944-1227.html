			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Edmond restored Dealings in Edmond Holdings, the housebuilder, were restored yesterday following the rejection at an EGM of a resolution to approve the acquisition of Linden, an unquoted housebuilder. Mr David Walsh, who became the non-executive chairman in place of Mr Andrew Naish, who stepped down as chairman after the meeting, said some institutions did not share the board's view that the acquisition represented the best way forward for Edmond. The shares, which were suspended last month at 21p, closed at 17 1/2p yesterday.</p>

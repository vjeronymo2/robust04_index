			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Need for greater clarity on creditworthiness  -Risk and Reward Last week's introduction by Moody's of specific ratings based on an institution's creditworthiness as a counterparty in the derivatives market highlighted the confusion in over how far existing ratings take account of derivatives activities. Moody's approach is only one way of tackling an increasingly troublesome issue, which now affects industrial companies and fund management companies as well as financial institutions. Mr John Kriz, associate director of Moody's, says the agency addresses the effects of derivatives activities on creditworthiness in its existing debt ratings, but greater precision is needed by participants in the derivatives market. He notes that many market participants apply existing ratings of an entity's debt as if they were general ratings of the entity's creditworthiness. 'This assumes a debt claim is on a par with a derivatives counterparty claim,' he warns. 'Looking at a debt rating as a proxy has pitfalls. The question is whether they are going to honour a financial contract: its a specific type of claim.' He also points out that many entities are not rated at all, but may be members of a group whose affiliates are rated. 'People often attribute a rated affiliate's rating to an unrated affiliate. This can lead to extreme misjudgment.' Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's greatest rival, introduced counterparty ratings in 1991, because of the broadening use of derivatives. However, unlike Moody's, S&amp;P only assigns these ratings on request, arguing that the full co-operation of management is needed for the process to be meaningful. As a result, S&amp;P has rated only about 50 counterparties. (Moody's, on the other hand, plans to assign counterparty ratings to more than 1,000 securities firms, banks, central governments, insurance companies, pension funds, industrial companies and others in coming months.) 'We do find that our existing deposit ratings - assigned to around 450 banks around the world - are used as proxies for counterparty risk,' said Mr Cliff Griep, executive managing director, financial institutions at S&amp;P. However, there are legal differences between the two, he warns, especially in the US, where there is a depositor preference law which 'puts the depositor in a slightly stronger position than other senior creditors in liquidation'. The gap, he says, is likely to be greater for lower rated entities, where liquidation analysis is a more important component of the rating process. Meanwhile, IBCA, which specialises in rating financial institutions, takes a different approach, assigning a broad credit rating to each entity (rather than to its long-term debt or deposits). 'I think our view has always been that ratings are not just for issues. If you look at the financial condition of an entity you can come out with a risk assessment for that entity,' says Mr Charles Prescott, director of IBCA. The rating agencies are striving to satisfy the growing appetite for credit information in the derivatives markets, heightened by a spate of large losses on derivatives positions, in particular the Dollars 1bn hit which nearly bankrupted German giant Metallgesellschaft. The importance of the Moody's ratings, and others which factor in derivatives exposure, is set to increase but the task of assigning them accurately is becoming increasingly daunting. Since many of the losses suffered in the derivatives markets have been the result of breaches of internal controls, it is hard to see how rating agencies could have factored the potential for such losses into the rating process.</p>

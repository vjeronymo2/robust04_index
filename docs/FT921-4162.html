			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: James Capel back in black at Pounds 9m - Closures, cost cutting and avoidance of accidents help result JAMES CAPEL, the broker owned by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, managed its best year since before the 1987 stock market crash with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 9.1m in 1991 for Pounds 6.1m after tax. The result, due to a renewed round of cost-cutting and the closure or sale of loss-making activities, followed losses of Pounds 30.3m in 1990. However, the result still amounted to a return of little more than 5 per cent on capital compared with the returns of 20 per cent to 25 per cent which most in the industry consider desirable. Mr Bernard Asher, put in by HKSB as executive chairman a year ago after the disastrous 1990 losses, moved quickly to cut costs. Some 300 jobs were shed during the year, about half of them in the UK, taking the total staff to about 2,300. Costs have been cut sharply at the Paris operation, with a staff now of about 130, compared with 250 little more than a year ago, in the wake of difficult conditions for broking firms generally and losses on options market making. The loss-making Australian operations were also cut drastically during the year, with staff falling from 130 to 60. Mr Asher, who is also chairman of Wardley, HKSB's merchant banking arm, shed some peripheral parts of the business, such as money broking, which had held the firm back. However, the turnround from 1990 owed more to businesses closed before he took over: convertibles, where trading losses had accounted for about half of the full-year loss, and fixed income, which was moved to the parent bank. The 1991 profit was also due in large part to Capel's success in avoiding its accident-prone ways of recent years, when it has periodically incurred heavy trading losses. These had led to a poor relationship between the firm and its parent, said to have been repaired by the appointment of Mr Asher, though at the cost of the firm's independence. Last year saw an improvement in the performance of Capel's UK equities side, its traditional core, said Mr James Fergusson, managing director. After the departure of some leading analysts and a decline in the firm's showing in polls of fund managers, Capel says its market share has returned to about 9 per cent.</p>

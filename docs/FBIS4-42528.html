			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Valmet Scales Down Its Aircraft </F> Industry"]    [Text] Valmet's aircraft industry is making a major  reduction in personnel, including a layoff of nearly a hundred  workers at the Kuorevesi site. The reason given for the  personnel reductions was a downturn in market conditions. The  downturn is most noticeable in the demand for the Redigo, a  training aircraft. The announcement of the layoffs came on  Thursday [5 May].    According to Managing Director Juhani Markula, conditions  are  expected to remain difficult for quite some time. As the backlog  of orders can provide work for only a short time, layoffs in  parts manufacturing for the Redigo plane will also be necessary  at Avicomp in August. Those layoffs would affect 100 employees  at the most.    The company began last Thursday to negotiate with personnel  on the reductions and layoffs. Valmet aviation currently has  1,000 employees, 800 of whom work in Kuorevesi. Nearly 200 more  work in the motor service units in Linnavuori in Nokia.    According to Markula, the intended measures do not threaten  the Hornet and Saab 2000 project or the production of air combat  materiel. However, the measures will affect all types of workers  in the aircraft industry.    Valmet had revenues of 256 million markkas last year in  comparison with 202 million markkas the year before. In 1992,  losses amounted to 23 million markkas, last year they dropped to  1 million markkas.    At year's end, it was expected that revenues would grow and  that profits would increase in the coming year. According to the  annual report, the number of aircraft in stock increased last  year as a result of canceled orders. The Saab 2000 project, in  turn, is behind schedule because of delays in technical approval.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Belgian PM sees privatisation case THE Belgian government should consider privatisation as a way of easing the burden of Belgium's large budget deficit, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, said yesterday. In an interview with the Financial Times he said that he hoped for 'an objective debate' about privatisation, but he cautioned against overestimating the impact of such measures. 'Part of the cleaning up (of public finances) has to include questioning or evaluating a certain number of tasks that the state has done in the past, which it's not clear it needs to do today,' he said. The opposition liberal parties in Belgium have long called for a privatisation policy, but Mr Dehaene, a Flemish Christian Democrat, would first have to convince his socialist coalition partners of the value of such a move. 'Privatisation isn't the panacea which is going to resolve all the problems,' he said 'It would have to be done in an orthodox way: it should serve to reduce debt, not finance current expenditure - which is the case with certain opposition plans - and thus the short-term impact would be less dramatic than some think.' Belgium has a large public sector, which includes the national lottery, a number of public credit institutions, the telecommunications, postal, and rail services. Work has already begun on giving some of these over-bureaucratic public bodies an autonomous company-style statute and putting in place a proper corporate management. Government officials stress that this is not necessarily a prelude to privatisation and Mr Dehaene himself says he would be happier giving priority to these 'intermediate routes' for the time being. Hill Samuel, the British merchant bank, and Petercam Securities, a Belgian broker, commissioned an academic study earlier this year which estimated that the state could raise some BFr318bn (Pounds 5.3bn) through privatisation of the assets which it owns directly.

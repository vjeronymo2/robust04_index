			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: THE AMERICAN WOMAN, 1988-89 A STATUS REPORT EDITED BY SARA  E. RIX (W.W. NORTON: $19.95)  </P> <P> Like the editor's "status report" last year, this book is largely a gloomy  survey of persistent inequities between the sexes: Women's median income for  full-time work, for instance, is still only 68% of men's. It is punctuated by  colorful notes about progress made in the last decade, however, not only in law  and medicine but in agriculture (once "invisible farmers," women are now  acknowledged linchpins of the rural community), religion (80% of Protestant  denominations in America now ordain women) and politics (the number of states  with incumbent female lieutenant governors went from 0 in 1970 to 15 in 1988).  </P> <P> Also like last year's volume, unfortunately, "The American Woman" lacks a  clearly defined readership. This book doesn't quite work as a journalistic  overview for a general readership, for there are no colorful, first-person  interviews to compel our attention. Nor is there serious analysis of  institutional problems to help activists and policy makers build movements for  change. A chapter on women in religion, for instance, argues that spiritual  freedom won't be complete until Catholic women can become clergy members, but  doesn't survey various church leaders to get a sense of how long women will  have to wait for equality and what they can do to hasten its arrival.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, "The American Woman" is a remarkably clear and concise reference  tool, one that will certainly be of use to at least one group: activists who  wish to counter the widespread myth that America has overcome the  discrimination that afflicted society before the Sexual Revolution.  </P></p>

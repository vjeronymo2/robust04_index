			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Hutchison revives telepoint service TELEPOINT, the mobile communication system that appeared to have ended with the termination of BT's Phonepoint service last October, was revived yesterday with an announcement from Hutchison Personal Communications. HPC, a division of Hutchison Telecommunications UK, the subsidiary of Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong Kong-based multinational group, said it would launch its telepoint network, called Rabbit, from June 29. The announcement raises hopes for telepoint, which seemed to have been a failure when BT withdrew its service, apparently because it had too few subscribers. Telepoint was launched in 1989 as a portable telephone service that was lighter, cheaper and more reliable than cellular phones. The system is based on a network of base stations installed in public places. Subscribers can make calls from within 100m of a base station. Poor marketing and lack of base stations resulted in low subscription levels. When BT's service closed there were only 3,300 base stations and about 800 customers. After the closure of BT's service and the earlier closure of Mercury's similar service, HPC is the only one of four groups licensed by the government to provide telepoint ser-vices which isdoing so. The fourth service was called Zonephone. HPC plans to have more than 12,000 base stations operational by October and expects the cost to users to be about a third to half the cost of using a cellular phone. Hutchison's telepoint network is based on an international standard that will allow subscribers to use their handsets in Hong Kong and Singapore, in each of which it has more than 15,000 subscribers, and in regions where the standard may come into use in future.</p>

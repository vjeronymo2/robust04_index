			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CHULA VISTA  </P> <P> A 21-year-old construction worker was shot three times when two groups of  students from separate Chula Vista high schools met in a park Monday night to  finish an argument started in a Tijuana bar, said a Chula Vista police  spokeswoman.  </P> <P> Daniel J. Ballesteros of Chula Vista was with one group of high school  students, Officer Carol Torres said.  </P> <P> He was treated for superficial wounds on his face, chest and abdomen, and  released from Kaiser Permanente Hospital, spokesman Jim McBride said.  </P> <P> Torres said Ballesteros was shot by Jesus Renteria, 19, a student at  Southwestern College in Chula Vista who had brought a shotgun and fired four  shots, hitting the victim in the chest, face, and left eye. Renteria was  arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and is being held in  County Jail downtown on $10,000 bail.  </P> <P> The altercation in Tijuana between two minors began over the weekend and  continued across the border, where a fight broke out at a Jack in the Box  restaurant in San Ysidro, Torres said, adding that San Diego police were  called, but that no one was injured or arrested.  </P> <P> The teen-agers decided to settle the dispute Monday at Greg Rogers Park on  Oleander Avenue, where students and adults carrying clubs and steel bars met at  8:17 p.m., Torres said.  </P></p>

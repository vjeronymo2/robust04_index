			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / People: Non-executive directors The Royal Mint is increasing its number of non-executive directors from two to three, all from the private sector. The two new members are Gisela Burg, managing director of Expotus, an exporter of UK audio industry products, and Sidney Taylor, TI's director of worldwide manufacturing systems and technology. They join Stuart Cameron, an ex-chairman and chief executive of Gallagher, the tobacco company. His fellow non-executive director, Joe Burnett-Stuart, formerly with Robert Fleming, has retired. The Mint, which made an operating profit of Pounds 11.8m in 1992-93, became an executive agency in April 1990 and is now undergoing a Treasury review of its status. It says there are 'no current plans' for its privatisation.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Baudouin Bollaert: "European Union Enlargement </F> -- the Twelve Caught in Institutional Trap"]    [Excerpt] Brussels -- [passage omitted]  <H5>  Compromise Being Examined </H5>   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, who is deeply involved  in the EU [European Union] enlargement process, had a long  telephone conversation on Sunday [20 March] with [Foreign  Minister] Alain Juppe to discuss possible compromise solutions.  The most credible -- although not liked by the EC Commission,  "guardian of treaties" -- would consist of granting a reasonable  "period for consideration" to the member states if a minority of  them reaches 23, 24, or 25 votes, instead of the 27 required to  block a decision.    According to Alain Juppe, France supports this solution  "with  three reservations":    1. It should not take the form of a protocol to be submitted  for ratification, but simply that of a political commitment.    2. The period for consideration should not exceed three  months.    3. This procedure should not be applied to "important  questions."    In Mr. Juppe's view, the current dispute should not be  regarded as an "ordinary quarrel on figures." Quite the  reverse, "it is the philosophy of European construction which is  at stake." Hence this assertion: "Better no agreement at all  than a bad agreement."    Who will give in first? "The influence of a member state is  measured primarily by the decisions it inspires, the actions in  which it participates, and not by those it hampers," [European  Affairs Minister] Alain Lamassoure said recently. "Yes to  expansion, no to a more cumbersome structure." To that, [UK  Foreign Secretary] Douglas Hurd replied that the British do not  want to "torpedo" enlargement, and that it is possible to  "reconcile" enlargement with "the protection of national  interests."    If nobody budges, it is almost certain that the European  Parliament will not give a positive opinion on enlargement.  Other national parliaments could then follow suit. That will  have two consequences: First, a real crisis among the Twelve  with the June European elections in the offing. Second, a  lamentable impression in the four candidate countries, which  have to hold referenda on membership. There is a fine mess  ahead unless common sense finally prevails.</p>

			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Rao misses summit as unrest continues MR PV Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, cancelled a visit to Bangladesh as Bombay and parts of Gujarat state in western India continued to burn for the sixth consecutive day yesterday. Mr Rao was due to attend a meeting of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation scheduled for Thursday and Friday. The summit was postponed indefinitely after India made clear at the weekend that the 'atmosphere was not conducive' to holding the conference. Bombay has been tense since last month's nationwide riots, triggered by the razing of a mosque in Ayodhya, northern India, by supporters of the radical Hindu Bharatiya Janata party. More than 1,200 people died in the ensuing violence. The latest phase of violence between Hindus and Moslems has claimed at least 168 lives. Eighty more people were killed in Bombay yesterday. In Ahmadabad and Baroda in Gujarat, more than 30 people were killed at the weekend before the authorities restored order. Six leaders of the BJP, including Mr Lal Krishan Advani and Mr Murli Manohar Joshi, are expected to be released unconditionally today, under orders from the Uttar Pradesh chief judicial magistrate. The men were arrested for inciting communal violence.</p>

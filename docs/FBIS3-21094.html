			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Francois Fillon, Minister for Higher </F> Education and Research, by Patrick Piernaz and Pierre Langereux;  place and date not given: "Fillon Says Aeronautic Industry Can  Be Supported by Upstream Research"]    [Text] [Piernaz/Langereux] The system of reimbursable  advances practiced by our country and our European partners to  support major aeronautics programs is coming under increasing  attack from our trading partners. Would it be easy to substitute  some other system?    [Fillon] Yes. It is possible to support aeronautical  development either by assistance to upstream research or by  indirect aid, as the United States is currently doing. Past  agreements allow us to finance up to 3 percent of a program's  cost through aid to research. Today we are averaging only 0.8  percent, so there is a lot of room to expand.    [Piernaz/Langereux] But are we in fact prepared to augment  that contribution?    [Fillon] Absolutely! And I would remind you that our budget  for 1994 is going to augment appropriations for upstream  research by 25 percent.    [Piernaz/Langereux] Aeronautical manufacturers dispute the  importance of that augmentation, because (they say) you're  starting from a very low level, so the 25 percent increase will  not amount to much. What is your response?    [Fillon] My answer is, they are right about the size of the  appropriation being modest. But no one should imagine that all  the aid is going to be transferred from one day to the next into  upstream research credits. Our objective is to augment these  appropriations gradually and to do so in such a way that the  overall volume of aid utilizable by the enterprises remains  comparable.    [Piernaz/Langereux] Who is going to receive this new aid to  upstream research?    [Fillon] This is one of our concerns. In fact, apart from  ONERA [National Officer for Aerospace Studies and Research],  there are few public-sector research entities specializing in  aeronautics. At the moment, many contracts are signed directly  with the enterprises.    [Piernaz/Langereux] Do you favor a sort of European NASA  that  would administer and direct a policy of upstream research?    [Fillon] No, I don't think such a cumbersome entity would be  the best instrument for conducting a voluntarist policy. A  European system would require negotiations between 12 parties,  each with its own special interests. Speaking generally, I don't  think the creation of big public-sector organisms would be  responsive to the problem. These questions are the subject of  frequent meetings between the enterprises and government offices  concerned, and I think we will find flexible and effective  solutions.    [Piernaz/Langereux] Doesn't the solution lie in support for  military programs that would have civilian spin-offs?    [Fillon] Certainly. And the proposed European military  transport aircraft presents the opportunity for a great deal of  cooperation and synergy between military and civilian research.  Military research organs are asking for closer cooperation with  civilians in dual-use technologies, which are more numerous than  I once thought. You must realize that the defense industry  consumes 30 percent of the country's research outlays while  accounting for only 5 percent of its production. It's clear that  our civilian industries must make better use of the 30 percent  earmarked for military research.    [Piernaz/Langereux] How do you and the minister for industry  handle the division of responsibilities for the space domain?    [Fillon] In general, Industry Minister Gerard Longuet (Cf.  A&amp;C No. 1453) has the lead in space affairs. But the  financing  for CNES [National Center for Space Studies] of course comes out  of the Research Ministry's budget. In addition, I pay special  attention to the scientific program and to research and  technology activities.    In particular, programs for manned space flight should  occupy  a place compatible with our means and objectives, and consistent  with our concept of France's role in space.    [Piernaz/Langereux] So you support the idea of French, or  rather European, participation in the new manned flight programs?    [Fillon] Yes, because it would be a serious mistake to let  the Americans and Russians be the only ones to send men into  space to do things. In my opinion, absenting ourselves from this  activity so essential for the future is unacceptable!    France and Europe should be major partners of the United  States and Russia in manned systems.    [Piernaz/Langereux] Do you think your view is widely shared  in Europe?    [Fillon] I think so. The subject came up recently at the G-7  meeting... I concluded that the Europeans were on the same  wavelength. And I noted they were in agreement in criticizing  the Americans for their attitude of deciding without consulting  with their partners--presenting Europeans with a fait accompli  on Russian participation in the "international" Space Station  project. Japan, like Europe, is wondering whether this new  version of the project is going to be NASA's last.    [Piernaz/Langereux] What's the status of the Franco-German  dialogue on the subject?    [Fillon] Unlike France, which is one of the few countries in  Europe whose research budget is increasing despite the economic  recession, Germany is being forced to accept very difficult  budget cuts...    The Germans are thus confronted with difficult choices. But  above all, they're proposing adoption of a concept of the manned  flight program that we believe needs revision to take account of  developments in the Russo-American discussions.    [Piernaz/Langereux] Here in France, what kind of  governmental  support does the plan have?    [Fillon] The prime minister has asked us to prepare an  interministerial council sometime in the first half of 1994 to  redefine France's position on all these space issues: That's  when Gerard Longuet will be able to move things forward.    [Piernaz/Langereux] Will there be a national debate on the  subject?    [Fillon] Yes. A debate in Parliament on the overall  directions of France's science policy, including space, is  planned for June 1994.</p>

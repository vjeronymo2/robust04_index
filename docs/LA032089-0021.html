			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A MORBID FEAR OF ILLNESS MAKES AMERICA TRASH GOOD FOOD AND COMMON SENSE  </P> <P> What this country needs right now is a national psychiatrist to determine why  Americans are discarding wholesome food in a mindless effort to reduce the risk  of cancer. It's a good bet that the professional 50-state diagnosis would be  acute nosophobia.  </P> <P> Nosophobia is defined as a morbid dread of illness. It is a form of psychosis  that is extremely hazardous to both physical and mental health; its effects on  our nation's children are particularly insidious.  </P> <P> The most recent and to date most virulent episode of national nosophobia was  triggered by the release last month of a report by the Natural Resources  Defense Council, which opined that trace levels of agricultural chemicals cause  cancer in kids. The sole basis for this phenomenal and frightening charge was  the assumption that huge levels of chemical pesticides that cause cancer in  mice must also be carcinogens in humans, even at the barely measurable levels  which might be found in produce.  </P> <P> The report had the ideal volatile mix for drawing public attention. Food is a  highly emotional topic, and rumors about food safety have always spread rapidly  and irrationally.  </P> <P> When you add in our universal concern about the safety of children, you have an  instant winner for a media blitz. "60 Minutes" gave us a member of Congress who  linked consumption of fruits and vegetables with the tragic appearance of  children in a cancer ward. Phil Donahue gave us Meryl Streep with suggestions  on how to use vinegar or detergent to get the carcinogens out.  </P> <P> By mid-March, one could almost palpate the national nosophobia, perhaps best  illustrated by the wire service report of a New York mother who, hearing on the  news one morning last week that apples cause cancer, called the state police to  intercept her child's school bus to remove the allegedly offensive fruit from  the lunch box. Even President Bush proclaimed that he drinks carrot juice  because carrots aren't sprayed with that nasty stuff.  </P> <P> What have we got here? We have a national tragedy of spectacular proportions,  one that is ultimately a real threat to the health of Americans, particularly  children. While there has never been a single case of ill health, in children  or adults, related to the regulated use of approved pesticides in the United  States (and no toxicologist worth his sodium chloride thinks that a mouse is a  little man) there are some real health hazards directly attributable to the  national nosophobia about apples and other produce.  </P> <P> Item: I was approached last week by a 10-year-old who asked me if she would  develop cancer from all that apple juice she drank as a baby from a bottle.  "When will I get the cancer?" she asked anxiously.  </P> <P> Item: My daughter stood by as her school discarded hundreds of pieces of apple  pie because they "caused cancer."  </P> <P> What are we doing to our children? What are they to think when we ban or  discard food that, for all their lives, was described to them as wholesome,  safe and health-promoting?  </P> <P> Item: Last weekend a neighbor of mine told me of her sheer hysteria about  cancer-causing apples. She was throwing out sauce, juice, the works, because no  risk was acceptable for her child (this "no acceptable risk" is the centerpiece  of the Meryl Streep campaign, Mothers and Others for Pesticide Limits). The  next morning I saw this same woman riding with her infant on the back of her  bike on a sandy road -- with no helmet on the baby.  </P> <P> Toxic terrorism, of the ilk of the Natural Resources Defense Council report,  causes nosophobia. Nosophobia causes unnecessary anxiety and blurred vision,  which negates our ability and our children's ability to distinguish between  real and hypothetical risks. And that puts the public health of this nation in  serious jeopardy.  </P></p>

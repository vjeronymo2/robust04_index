			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By station commentator Kondratyev from the "Current Event </F> and Commentary" program]    [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev is scheduled to  visit China from 26-29 January. Station commentator Kondratyev  said: The main purpose of Kozyrev's forthcoming visit is to  prepare for the second Sino-Russian high-level meeting.  Everybody will recall that Russian President Yeltsin held  high-level talks with Chinese leaders during his visit to  Beijing at the end of 1992. That first contact between Russian  and Chinese leaders yielded good results. Today, we can  definitely say that relations between the two countries have  flourished since that meeting. They cover many aspects of  state-to- state relations, including economic relations and  trade, cooperation in military technology, and border issues.  There is ample reason to believe that bilateral trade volume  will vastly surpass the highest level of 1982, which was $5.8  billion. Cooperation in military technology has also proceeded  smoothly. Here, we would like to specifically emphasize that  military cooperation between Russia and China is not directed at  any third country. The Russian-Chinese border issue has been  resolved without encountering more difficulties. Reductions in  each other's border troops and confidence-building measures have  also yielded results.    During his visit to Beijing, Kozyrev will mainly discuss  relations between the two countries. During the visit he is  expected to sign agreements on border checkpoints and  consultations between the foreign ministers of the two  countries. Certainly, the two sides will exchange views on  major international and regional issues. Furthermore, the  Russian delegation will acquaint itself with China's experience  in building special economic zones. These zones have had a  positive impact on China's economy. In short, Kozyrev's visit  may score great successes.</p>

The effects on the material induced by a  laser pulse are produced in a very short period of time and in  small areas. Exact knowledge about these effects is important  for optimal laser utilization. However, there are two goals in  observation. First, the observation procedure must possess high  magnification. It should also possess high temporal resolution  in order to be able to represent the effects of individual laser  pulses. Professor Oleg Bostanjoglo and his colleagues from the  Optical Institute of the Berlin Technical University (Strasse  des 17. Juni 135, 10623 Berlin) have now developed a high-speed  electron microscope (EM) linked with a pulsed laser which  possesses the necessary properties. The device makes it possible  to depict precisely laser-induced crystallization and  vaporization processes. According to Bostanjoglo, large effects  can be produced in small target areas by irradiating material  with pulsed lasers. The high heating and cooling rates lead to  the formation of new phases and structures in the irradiated  materials which are not attainable using other methods. The  technical utilization of the laser is only in its infancy, but  has already led to important applications. These include the  boring of very small holes, the labeling of components, the  hardening of metal surfaces and employment in digital optical  read/write memory. Until now the electron microscope has been of  only limited use in the investigation of microscopic effects,  since while it is sensitive to structure and possesses high  resolution spatially, in conventional use it possesses only low  temporal resolution. The Berlin scientists have thus converted a  commercial electron microscope into a high-speed apparatus.In  principle, rapid-exposure photographs can be made in two ways.  In continuous operation the sample is constantly irradiated by  the electron beam, that is both during and after the laser  bombardment. With the help of a  scintillator-storage-oscilloscope combination as a detector the  individual phases can then be observed with high temporal  resolution. The second possibility is that of producing  rapid-exposurejphotographs of laser processing with the help of  an image enhancer. These photographs are produced by pulses  either from the source of illumination or from the image  enhancer.In order to investigate the direct effect of the laser  beam on the sample, a Nd:YAG laser is combined with the  high-speed EM. The laser*beam pulse is focused on the sample in  the EM by a laser objective and a deflecting mirror which has a  hole for the electron beam. The laser beam and the electron beam  run in parallel in the same direction and thus make it possible  to investigate the laser effects in real time in a controlled  way. The Berlin high-speed electron microscope makes it possible  to take rapid-exposure photographs with illumination times from  five nanoseconds. The interval between pictures is between 30  nanoseconds and a few microseconds. Both reflective EM  investigations of massive materials and transmission EM  observations of thin layers can be carried out. The individual  pictures can be combined into a "film" in order to observe the  dynamics of laser-induced material transformation.  Investigations with the high-speed EM have thus far been  directed towards research on crystallization processes in  semiconductors, structural changes in metals during laser  processing, and laser-induced vaporization of thin layers. These  researchers aim to achieve a better understanding of laser  processing procedures like removal, alloyage, recrystallization,  grain formation and vitrification. The projects are being  supported by the German Research Association.</p>

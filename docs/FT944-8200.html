			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (2): Chancellor of unification - Mr Kohl has triumphed again. But for how long? Mr Helmut Kohl's narrow victory in the German elections, with a majority of just 10 seats for his conservative-liberal coalition, was a personal triumph for the German chancellor. In less than nine months, he transformed a lame-duck administration, trailing several points behind its opponents in the polls, into a winner. He did it very largely thanks to his own reputation and his own efforts. Yet his victory may prove to have been more Pyrrhic than real. Many are already speculating about how long the current coalition can last. On the one hand, the very narrowness of the victory has done wonders in concentrating the minds of the coalition partners. The usually interminable negotiations between Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its Bavarian sister-party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and their minority liberal partners, the Free Democratic Party (FDP), have been completed in record time. Trouble might well have been expected from either of the small parties. The FDP, in particular, in spite of being decimated in the election, with a drop in support from 11 per cent in 1990 to under 7 per cent, nevertheless holds the balance of power in the Bundestag. It desperately needs to gain an independent profile. But Mr Klaus Kinkel, the party leader and foreign minister, went along with a strategy of papering over the cracks. The CSU, now the second largest party in the coalition, might have held out for bigger and better jobs at the expense of the FDP. But Mr Theo Waigel, the CSU leader and finance minister, also played it cool. They all agree on the broad outline of government priorities, on the need to cut back public spending from the present 51 per cent of gross national product, to reduce the budget deficit within the guidelines of the Maastricht treaty. All this must be done while continuing to finance the burden of German unification, requiring massive public transfers to restructure the east German economy, to pay for the continuing high unemployment, finance the local government administration which still lacks any reliable tax base, and pay for large-scale investment in all forms of infrastructure. As for foreign policy, it is also broadly agreed, with a strategy of enlarging the European Union to the east linked with further clear steps to greater integration in the west. On the other hand, the difficulties will lie in the detail, in the tactics, rather than the strategy. Precise details of the promised reforms of corporate taxation, of social spending cuts, and of measures to combat rising crime and illegal immigration, could all upset the apple-cart. Foreign policy, too, may not be as straightforward as it looks, with differences between the parties on the pace of opening to the east, and on European integration. The problems for Mr Kohl certainly look fairly daunting. In the first place, he heads a tired team, urgently in need of fresh blood, but with little available to revive it. His new cabinet looks depressingly like the old one. Mr Kinkel has emerged from the election campaign looking like a loser, and may indeed be replaced by his party next year, if it can find an alternative. Mr Waigel has also failed to stamp his authority on his own party, having failed to become prime minister in Bavaria last year. Remaining in Bonn is obviously his second choice. Both return to the cabinet with their former jobs. The brightest lights in the government are relatively junior.  In the CDU, Mr Matthias Wissmann, hitherto transport minister and before that briefly research minister, has shown himself competent and an effective communicator. In the CSU, Mr Horst Seehofer, as health minister, was also one of the success stories of the previous administration. The freshest new face is that of 28-year-old Ms CLaudia Nolte, who has shot straight into the cabinet as minister for women, youth, families and the elderly, combining two former ministries. Overall, there will be 17 ministers, two fewer than before. Chancellor Kohl has compounded his personnel problems by giving intimations of his own mortality: he let it be known during the election campaign that he would not stand again in 1998. That seems certain to unleash a debilitating succession struggle in the not-too-distant future, unless he goes back on his word. In his own party, his natural successor, Mr Wolfgang Schauble, the CDU parliamentary leader, has the severe handicap of being wheelchair-bound following an assassination attempt in 1990. Mr Volker Ruhe, another erstwhile crown prince, has not enhanced his reputation as defence minister, and is thoroughly unpopular in his own party. Mr Kohl's instinct for political survival has ensured that most potential rivals for his position - like Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, now state premier in Saxony, or Mr Heiner Geissler, the former party secretary-general - have been banished from the corridors of power. The succession struggle may only begin in a couple of years. But the chancellor faces a more immediate problem: how to rule not only with a paper-thin majority in the Bundestag, but against a hostile majority in the Bundesrat, the second house of parliament, representing the 16 federal states. The Bundesrat never operates entirely along party-political lines, representing a complex mix of state governments which range from grand coalitions between the CDU and the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD), through 'rainbow' coalitions of many parties - SPD, Greens and FDP, for example - to single party rule in a minority of states. The SPD's leading role in a majority of the governments means that it has the capacity to block legislation, above all where finance is required. So Mr Kohl faces the prospect of having to rule in a de facto grand coalition with the SPD in the Bundesrat, as well as with his FDP and CSU partners in the Bundestag. This really means that Germany's states will continue to wield considerable power in Bonn - as when they were able to win substantially increased influence over European Union decisions in the process of ratifying the Maastricht treaty. They can trim the ambitions of the federal government, and upset plans for strict spending control. Mr Kohl is a past master at the consensus-building required by such a political stalemate, but it does mean that decision-making becomes enormously time-consuming and unwieldy. Perhaps his greatest problem will be the unpredictability of his junior coalition partner, the FDP. The liberals, members of almost every Bonn coalition, were punished by voters for their lack of policy profile, and their lack of personalities. They only managed to scrape back into the Bundestag thanks to a large number of second votes - in favour of a party list, rather than individual candidates - transferred by CDU supporters, who calculated (correctly) that without the FDP in parliament, the coalition would have no majority at all. The temptation now will be to seek that profile by distancing themselves from their coalition partners. Mr Kinkel is committed to the coalition: he fought the election on that basis, and fought the doubters in his party. But there are clearly those within its ranks - including Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the former economics minister, and possibly Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the former leader and foreign minister, who remains very much the father-figure - who might be tempted to bring down the coalition in mid-term, with an eye to the next elections. One strategy would be to force the CDU and SPD into a grand coalition, as happened in 1969, leading ultimately to a change in 1972 to an SPD-FDP coalition under Chancellor Willy Brandt. Another, much less predictable, would be simply to switch allegiance to the SPD in a rainbow coalition with the Greens. With the FDP desperate to recover its lost electors, any such strategy may be possible. Mr Kohl will do his level best to keep them on board, because he knows that the alternative of a grand coalition with the SPD has never proved healthy for his party in the past. It allows the Social Democrats to demonstrate that they can be worthy and reliable members of a government, to overcome the conservative German electors' innate mistrust. As for the SPD itself, the party leadership has adopted a strategy of wait-and-see. The election result was a disappointment, but in the end, not a disaster. Mr Rudolf Scharping, the youthful leader, has moved from his provincial base in Mainz, where he was state premier, to the Bundestag as parliamentary leader, giving himself the national platform he needs to prepare for a possible change of power. He knows that the pressure is on Mr Kohl and his coalition rather than on the opposition. He has problems on two fronts: he must ensure that his main rival for the party leadership, the smoother and more articulate Mr Gerhard Schroder, state premier in Lower Saxony, cannot mount a challenge. As he was closely involved in the SPD election strategy, he cannot distance himself from blame for the defeat. The other problem is to oppose the Chancellor, without being seen to be totally negative: the SPD majority in the Bundesrat must be used with care. That is the in-built pressure in the German system towards consensus. Nothing is entirely predictable about the next four years in German political life. But the consensus-building system will probablymuddle on, never producing entirely clear decisions, but still finding acceptable solutions. It is really more a system of non-government, than strong government, which may well be one secret of German success.</p>

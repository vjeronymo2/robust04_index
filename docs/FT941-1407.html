			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Foreign banks in London top 500 The number of foreign banks in London topped 500 for the first time last year, enhancing the capital's status as Europe's most significant financial centre. According to a survey by Noel Alexander Associates, a consultancy which specialises in financial statistics, the 15 foreign banks that disappeared from London - either through leaving or through mergers and takeovers - were more than offset by the 35 which arrived, making the total 514. The survey, which is published each year, reflects the changes to international banking in London. Two of the new banks that opened were from Russia; two from the Czech republic; one from former Yugoslavia, and one from Slovenia. Two were from China, three from Hong Kong and one from Thailand. Six of the 15 banks which disappeared did so as a result of mergers and takeovers. Western European banks accounted for five of these, with the remaining one being the takeover of the Canadian Royal Trust Bank by Royal Bank of Canada. New Foreign Bank Offices in London.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jose Otero and Jose Quintero] </F>   [Text] President Guillermo Endara has suggested that  Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential candidate on the "United  People's" ticket, withdraw his challenge to President Endara to  show all the videos of the military dictatorship, because if  Perez Balladares does not, the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary  Party] will be the main party affected.    PRD presidential candidate Perez Balladares on Friday  publicly challenged President Endara to broadcast on television  all the videos the president has on how the people were mocked  during the cabinet council meetings during the past military  regime.    Endara phoned Circuito RPC Television station during the  "Let  Us Find Solutions" program hosted by Julio Miller to make a  statement. Endara recommended that the PRD presidential  candidate withdraw his challenge or face the consequences.    The president told Perez Balladares several times to  "withdraw your challenge, because those videos will affect you."    Endara explained that he had not officially decided whether  he would broadcast the unedited videos, but he warned that he  had already set aside the time slot between 2000 and 2100 on  Channel 11 [Panama City Sistema de Television Educativa] to air  the videos on the abuses of the past military regime.    "Perhaps the scenes you will see on Channel 11 will not be  as  dramatic as those you saw on Thursday, but they will confirm the  cynicism and disregard for the people upon which the PRD prided  itself in the past," Endara stressed.    Endara denied that the videos he broadcast on a national  network were part of the 15,000 boxes that the U.S. Government  has had since the 1989 military invasion.    "With God as my witness, that video was given to me on 5  April and I went through a real calvary before making my  decision," the president added.    Endara said he knew about these videos filmed at the  Presidential Palace but that until he was shown the contents he  had never been interested in watching them, because he was too  busy with the huge task of rebuilding the country.    "In addition to those videos, I know there are rooms full of  documents that belonged to the previous regime. I have never  looked at them because I am not interested in the problems of  the presidents who were in office before me," Endara said.    The president added that before deciding to show the video  on  television he consulted with Mireya Moscoso de Gruber,  presidential candidate for the Arnulfist Party.    Endara said that Mireya advised him to think hard before  making a decision because it could hurt him. Endara added that  at no time did the Arnulfist Party candidate try to benefit from  the videos.    Likewise, President Endara said that his decision to  publicly  air the videos did not violate the Santa Maria Pact because he  never used his office to support political interests.    "At no place in the Santa Maria Pact did I commit myself to  being impartial. I promised to abide by the Constitution and  the laws, and that is what I have done throughout my term in  office," Endara said.    Meanwhile, at 1900 on Monday, the Peace and Justice  Commission will meet with all the political parties to analyze  the president's speech during the radio and television network.  The meeting will be held at Santa Maria La Antigua University  auditorium.    A bulletin issued by the commission advised that its members  met on 15 April to discuss the president's actions and decided  to inform the delegates of the political parties that signed the  Santa Maria Pact of their views on Monday.</p>

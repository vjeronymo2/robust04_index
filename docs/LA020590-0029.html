			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> EAST GERMANY'S THOMAS VOLLMER IN U. S. DEBUT  </P> <P> East German dancer Thomas Vollmer's U.S. debut in Long Beach Ballet's sprightly  "Coppelia" lent a splendid comic flair to the proceedings. Seen Saturday  afternoon at the Terrace Theater, the St. Leon confection (re-created by  artistic director David Wilcox) featured Helena Ross as Swanilda and Ake  Pakarinen as her swain.  </P> <P> Ross, an effortless technician with lyrical arms, offered a pliant, musical  response to the Delibes score, played by the Long Beach Orchestra under Patrick  Flynn.  </P> <P> Pakarinen, an attentive partner and an amiable Franz so long as he didn't have  to exert himself unduly, abandoned his character in strained-looking, often  shapeless solo work. By Act III, even his partnering began to look tired.  </P> <P> Vollmer was busy impersonating eccentric Dr. Coppelius. With his upper body  pitched forward in a nearsighted haze, Vollmer made the old fool come alive.  His ludicrous "attack" mode (an impossibly wide splayed-leg stance), his silent  asides at Franz's seemingly idiotic pursuit of a doll, his gleeful celebration  of Coppelia's seeming transformation and his deep hurt at seeing the ruse  revealed were grandly comic moments warmed by a gemutlich view of humankind. A  few moments of celebratory hijinks in Act III suggested that Vollmer does  indeed have a bravura side to show as well.  </P> <P> Statuesque Paula Vreulink, who took an unfortunate spill later in Act III, cut  a figure of generously phrased, legato grace in the Prayer solo. Maricar Drilon  and Chris Sircello were deft, teasing lovers in the Flirtation Dance and Orna  Harari delivered a small-scale, terre-a-terre Dawn that rose only  half-heartedly above the horizon.CATHY CURTIS  </P></p>

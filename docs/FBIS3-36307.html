			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia and Russian </F> Defense Minister Pavel Grachev by unidentified correspondent in  Tbilisi on 3 February--recorded]    [Excerpt] [Otar Patsatsia] This is an historic occasion.  It not only has political importance but also economic  importance. We are witnessing deep forms of fraternity and  friendship between the Georgian and Russian peoples, and these  are at the stage of restoration. It is necessary for us to  restore them. We pin great hopes on this large package [of  agreements] that was just signed. This will provide an impetus  in the development of the economy in our republic.    [Correspondent] Thank you.    [Pavel Grachev] These issues were agreed upon at the level  of working groups. A consent has been acquired from the two  presidents. I had a talk with Eduard Ambrosyevich Shevardnadze  on this subject yesterday. He confirmed all these intentions,  and this morning our experts finished the text of the protocol  we signed.    [Correspondent] Will the issue of the return of refugees to  Abkhazia be discussed, and how safe would it be?    [Grachev] All issues linked with the further work, even the  the principal treaty our presidents will sign, will certainly be  linked with the situation in Abkhazia as well as the situation  in South Ossetia. Indeed, without a stable political situation  in the Georgian state, all of these good undertakings, good  protocols, and all other good things will not gain momentum. A  firm, good, and stable political situation is required.  [passage omitted]</p>

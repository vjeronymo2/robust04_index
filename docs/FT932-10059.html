			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / A clean break at last: The sweeping national realignment of Italy's political landscape The dust is yet to settle on what Italians have called the 'big bang'. But the extraordinary break-up of the country's political system is beginning to yield new alliances that symbolise the struggle to restore confidence in a discredited state. The national political realignment is taking place either within the existing parties or by their splintering and forming new associations, as politicians seek desperately to recycle themselves. Prominent among them is Mr Mario Segni, the leader of the referendum movement on constitutional reform, who in early April broke after 16 years with the Christian Democrats. At the weekend he took the first steps towards heading a new Roman Catholic centrist party - based around the year-old reformist association, Democratic Alliance. The latter is still only a movement to test the wind in the June municipal elections. Another who is trying to recycle his standing is Mr Giuliano Amato, the former Socialist premier, who is rethinking his previously announced withdrawal from politics. Capitalising on his reputation as a skilful and courageous premier, he is considering forming a new social democratic formation. To the left is another grouping around the PDS. Meanwhile, both the Christian Democrat and Socialist leaderships have said that they intend to resurrect their own parties by changing their names and symbols. Both the break-up and reformation have been held back until now because many old guard politicians blocked it. At the same time, the reformers lacked the courage to make a clean break. The disintegration started nearly three years ago with the metamorphosis of the old Italian Communist party into the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). However, the wave of corruption scandals unearthed by magistrates since early last year has proved the biggest single catalyst in discrediting the traditional parties that have ruled Italy since the second world war. Three events radically altered the panorama: the fall of the Amato government, the advent of a transitional administration under former governor of the Bank of Italy, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, and the outcome of the April 18-19 referendums on constitutional reform. Italy now has a government whose specific task is to introduce electoral reform in line with the principles laid down by the referendum. The overwhelming referendum vote ending public funding of political parties and introducing reform of the proportional representation system was a profound message of protest from the electorate. Voters are no longer prepared to give their loyal support to parties which never bothered to prepare programmes yet managed to remain in power through unstable coalitions (the Ciampi government is the 52nd since the war). Instead they want governments with specific platforms, which are answerable to the electorate and which can be defeated at the polls. This would produce the vital change-over of power which Italy has lacked, and which arguably lies behind the consolidation of corruption. Italy could adopt, as early as July, a first-past-the-post-system for two-thirds of the deputies and senators, the remainder still being elected by proportional representation to safeguard minority interests. The prospect of fresh elections in October and the impending municipal/regional elections in June, affecting 11m voters, provoked a flurry of flirtations. The most striking new political force is the populist Lombard League of Mr Umberto Bossi, which claims nearly a third of the vote in the north. Mr Bossi seems content to focus on conquering the north and playing for a devolution of power to the regions. Few seem willing to withdraw from national politics, save those too tainted by the corruption scandals to be publicly acceptable. In the latter category are Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader, against whom Milan magistrates are seeking to press corruption charges, and Mr Giulio Andreotti, the veteran Christian Democrat and seven times premier, whom Palermo magistrates want to question. Such elder statesmen, many now humbled, are likely to find themselves overtaken by the all-engulfing nature of the changes that are uprooting a whole political culture - and with it the dominant role of the state in the economy. The need for this 'big bang' was evident in the wake of the general elections in April last year. Even then it seemed likely that Mr Segni's referendum movement would be able to gain sufficient signatures to prosper with proposals to reform voting for the Senate. The Amato coalition of Christian Democrats, Socialists, social democrats and liberals was forced out of office because it was too identified with the 'partitocracy' - the carving-up of power and the institutions of state among a corrupt party elite. Not only was the coalition undermined by losing five ministers implicated in the scandals, it also lacked the moral authority to carry out electoral reform, which all parties accepted as an essential step towards renewing the political system. The task has fallen on Mr Ciampi, 72, the first non-parliamentarian to head a government this century. His was a choice of last resort, underlining the bankruptcy of established politics. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro turned to his unquestioned prestige when the parties were unable to agree on anyone to perform this thankless responsibility. Mr Ciampi nearly fell at the first hurdle when the PDS and the Greens pulled out within 10 hours of his forming a cabinet. His position remains tenuous. He has been obliged to rely upon the same slim majority as the outgoing four-party coalition of Mr Amato. His strongest card is the fact that if he loses parliamentary support there is no alternative but immediate elections. This would be a recipe for disastrously unstable government, with imponderable consequences for economic management. The April referendum has introduced reform only for the Senate; without a balancing reform in the Chamber of Deputies, different electorate systems would apply for the two houses, which have equal powers of veto over each other. The length of the government will depend on whether a majority in parliament believes Mr Ciampi's mandate is solely electorial reform, or if he has a broader brief to manage the economy. The former implies elections by the autumn once new rules are agreed; the latter a longer tenure, prehaps until next spring, allowing the parties to regroup. Mr Ciampi's hand is inherently weak because of the serious splits within the parliamentary majority on which he must rely. These splits will become more evident after the municipal and regional elections in June. If he survives beyond the autumn, it would create the curious precedent of a non-politician leading a democracy through a political crisis after its politicians completely failed to do so.</p>

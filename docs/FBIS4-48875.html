			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by CAR Chairman Yaovi Agboyibor in Lome on </F> 26 May; read by "Mr. Apevo"--recorded]    [Text] [Words indistinct] Following the naming of Edem  Kodjo's government on 25 May, the CAR [Action Committee for  Renewal] wishes to issue the following statement. The CAR has  observed that:    1. In accordance with its 23 April statement, none of its  members agreed to join Edem Kodjo's cabinet.    2. The presidential group holds more than 60 percent of the  ministerial posts.    3. Four of the five most important ministerial posts,  national defense, foreign affairs, interior, and security, are  held by members of the presidential group.    The CAR is also surprised that Edem Kodjo continues to claim  he belongs to the CAR-UTD [Togolese Union for Democracy]  parliamentary majority and that he will implement the majority  group's joint program. In fact, through his obstinacy to form  his government in violation of the 26 March agreement, Edem  Kodjo is dealing with a majority that is not the one that was  chosen during the 6 and 20 February parliamentary elections.  This is evident in the composition of his government.    Moreover, in order to mislead the people, Edem Kodjo, in his  introductory statement during the naming of his cabinet, went to  great lengths to point out that he accepted the prime minister's  post to save the parliamentary majority. In the same  introductory statement, Edem Kodjo concedes that his government  did not meet the people's aspirations.    The CAR, therefore, thinks it is a matter of urgency to form  a legitimate and credible government which reflects the wishes  expressed by the people during the parliamentary elections and  which will meet with the people's approval.    Issued in Lome on 26 May for the CAR by its chairman, Yaovi  Agboyibor.</p>

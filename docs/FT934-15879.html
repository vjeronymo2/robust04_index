			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Bhutto claims she has enough support to form government MS Benazir Bhutto said yesterday she would form Pakistan's next government in Islamabad, but her arch rival, Mr Nawaz Sharif refused to concede defeat. Ms Bhutto's Pakistan People's party won a significant lead in Wednesday's elections over the Pakistan Moslem League, winning 92 seats to the PML's 72 seats in the 217-seat lower house of the parliament, the national assembly. Ms Bhutto hopes to widen her alliance by including other independent members and smaller parties, which would give her a majority. She said yesterday: 'Mr Nawaz Sharif has lost the battle. The numbers cannot be played with. There is no way that he can catch up.' The results have raised fears that the new government could be weak if it is pulled in different directions by coalition partners. Pakistan's most difficult challenge is that of putting in place a stable government which would end a year of crisis in government. The country's four provinces go to the polls today, with the crucial fight in the Punjab, Pakistan's largest and most prosperous province. While urban Punjab is Mr Sharif's territory, the PPP and its allies are strong in rural districts. In Wednesday's general elections the PPP and its allies won slightly more Punjab seats than the PML. Both sides are now hoping to win enough seats to form the government in all four provinces. Although the PPP is still expected to form the central government, the provincial election results would establish the extent to which Mr Sharif could stall Ms Bhutto politically, by hampering central government policies. Mr Sharif is also insisting on forming the central government through a new coalition in order to rally his supporters before today's provincial elections. Mr Siddiq-ul-Farooq, a senior aide to Mr Sharif, said last night: 'We are confident of forming the government at the centre. We are in contact with smaller groups and individually elected members to seek their support.'</p>

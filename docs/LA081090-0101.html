			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RANDY LEWIS: CENSORS COULD MAKE U.S. THE LAND OF BLAND  </P> <P> Recent news items:  </P> <P> * RENO -- Members of British heavy-metal group Judas Priest testify in a trial  in which they are accused of planting subliminal messages in songs that  allegedly triggered the self-inflicted deaths of two fans.  </P> <P> * PHOENIX -- A supermarket chain pulls copies of "The Little Mermaid" home  video from its shelves because a customer complains of finding a phallic symbol  in the cover artwork.  </P> <P> * KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Two newspapers refuse to run this week's Doonesbury comic  strips because they show a female character wearing nothing but rope and a  bucket and spouting provocative language.  </P> <P> Any of these stories should be enough to send a thinking adult away shaking his  or her head in disbelief.  </P> <P> Yet, even taken together, they represent only a smattering of cases where  citizens, in their zeal to do the right thing, seem intent on turning America  the Beautiful into the land of the bland, the home of the straitjacketed.  </P> <P> Take the case of the poor "Little Mermaid." She was sitting on shelves in video  stores and supermarkets around the country, minding her own business, when that  woman in Phoenix complained that she had found a (gasp) phallic symbol on the  underwater castle on the cover. The woman insisted that the video be withdrawn,  so as not to pollute innocent minds. (Speaking of which, what was she doing  searching for phalluses in Disney cartoons?) And, instead of shrugging off the  complaint as a case of someone with too much time on her hands, the store's  management knuckled under.  </P> <P> Then there are the two Midwest newspapers -- one in Indiana and one in Missouri  (the, ahem, "Show Me" state) -- that pulled the plug on Doonesbury's commentary  on the ruckus over the National Endowment for the Arts and artistic censorship.  The editors who decided against running the strips claimed they weren't  appropriate to the comics, which appeal to readers of all ages.  </P> <P> I hope they don't take a hard look at the "Love Is . . . " strip, which  features young male and female characters wearing no clothes. Sometimes  together. And they are always talking about love. This appears every day.  </P> <P> Heave. Grunt. Pant.  </P> <P> Probably the most amazing story, though, is the one about the families suing  CBS Records and Judas Priest because two youths killed themselves after a heavy  session of drinking, smoking pot and listening to Judas Priest's 1978 "Stained  Class" album.  </P> <P> The plaintiffs are out to prove that 1) there were subliminal messages saying  "Do it" implanted on the album and that 2) these messages caused the two boys  to take their own lives. (One died instantly; the other lived, horribly  disfigured, for three years after the suicide attempt and then died of related  complications.)  </P> <P> "Whether the judge rules in our favor or not, I feel like we've already won,"  one mother said. "This case has brought so much public attention to the issue.  The problems with heavy-metal music are finally out in the open. Bands are  beginning to be censored, and I'm happy about it."  </P> <P> It's hard to fault parents for grieving over a child's suicide, or for  desperately feeling the need to place blame -- but not when they start grasping  at straws. And certainly not when attorneys set their sights on a likely victim  (i.e., one with loads of money) and swim hungrily in for the kill.  </P> <P> According to court records, one of these boys came from a home where his mother  had been married four times; where, as a youth, he was physically abused by his  stepfather and reportedly was whipped with a belt. Both youths dropped out of  school in the 10th grade and both used alcohol, marijuana, amphetamines and  cocaine, among other substances.  </P> <P> Yet at least one of the mothers still blames the music, saying, "Heavy metal  changed his personality. When James started listening to Judas Priest, he lost  all respect for authority." This even though, 12 years earlier, at the age of  8, respectful young James, according to testimony, tried to choke that selfsame  mother while she was driving him home from school. And that was five years  before Judas Priest was ever heard from on record.  </P> <P> Respect for authority that large could be lost in the space between a bee's  teeth.  </P> <P> I suppose if this kid had spent his teen years watching the ballet, those  physical and emotional blows would have just bounced right off him, and he'd be  just fine today.  </P> <P> Texas rocker Joe Ely wrote a song a few years ago called "Dig All Night" in  which he pinpointed this creeping virus of finger-pointing and the chronic  shortage of personal responsibility infecting our society:  </P> <P>  I'm sitting here wondering:  </P> <P>  The world's gone to hell.  </P> <P>  Can we blame someone else  </P> <P>  For the trouble we're in?  </P> <P>  In a big easy chair  </P> <P>  At the world we stare  </P> <P>  As the world caves in  </P> <P>  And it ain't no wonder  </P> <P>  Why we don't get a break.  </P> <P>  It's so easy to find  </P> <P>  Someone else's mistake.  </P> <P>  The ripples can be felt right here in our own neighborhoods, from worrywarts  who perceive threats from rap bands and theater producers to city councils that  enact laws to fashion a world in which nothing ever offends anyone anywhere.  The notion of learning to handle life's daily irritations apparently has given  way to efforts to eliminate them all.  </P> <P> Somewhere along the dusty road to cultural maturity, we seem to have lost our  grip on the all-important tolerance upon which this country was founded. In  most of these examples, it's equally clear that we've mislaid any sense of  humor.  </P> <P> Heaven forbid the time has come when we should look to Michael Jackson as a  role model, but as long as we're quoting song lyrics, maybe we'd be better off  spending more time trying to grasp the meaning of The Buckled One's hit "Man in  the Mirror" than looking for pornography in Disney videos or suicide  instructions in Judas Priest records:  </P> <P> If you wanna make the world a better place,  </P> <P>  Take a look at yourself and then make a change.  </P> <P> </P></p>

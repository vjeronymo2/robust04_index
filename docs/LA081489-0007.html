			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A THINK TANK FOR THE NEW WEST  </P> <P> Everyone's notion of the West is different, but most personal concepts have  strong ties to both the facts and myths of the American frontier. One of the  facts has been that considerable public policy affecting the West has been  developed and implemented in the East: from Harvard and Yale, Wall Street, the  federal Establishment and Washington-based think tanks. This policy usually has  centered around the West's land and natural resources without much thought  given to the residue of exploitation. And the concept has not changed much in  the public mind despite the new frontier built on the basis of economic,  technological, scientific and human resources.  </P> <P> A vigorous effort is under way to change that perception and develop a new  identity for the West as a window on the Pacific world. The event is the  creation of a research and consulting institute based in Denver and called the  Center for the New West. While billed as a public/private partnership, the  primary motivation for this new western think tank came from US WEST, the  14-state Bell operating company created out of the breakup of AT&amp;T in 1984.  US WEST, working with a former official of the Western Governors' Assn.,  developed a precursor group called the Western States Strategy Center to  address economic development and public policy issues in the western states.  This has evolved into the Center for the New West, which is affiliated with a  number of public groups including the western governors, Western States' Water  Council and Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education.  </P> <P> The center is strongly market-oriented, with an emphasis on assisting small and  medium-sizedbusinesses striving for success in a rapidly changing global  economy. Center officials say they reject the notion -- which they claim is too  prevalent in the East -- that the United States is doomed to an ever-declining  role in the global economy. "Our purpose is to inject sound ideas and  strategies for the future prosperity of the West into the public dialogue,"  according to its goals.  </P> <P> There is no question that US WEST will benefit from economic prosperity in its  14-state territory. But the center also can serve a broad western interest in  many ways. One way certainly is the use of telecommunications to create new  forms of economic development in small cities and towns throughout the West  that have suffered through the boom-and-bust cycles of resource exploitation.  To develop the credibility it seeks, the center also needs to pay careful  attention to the history, culture and environment of the West.  </P> <P> There is some encouragement to be found in the center's first newsletter. One  article, by senior fellow Leonard Slosky, says the center will explore ways to  expand the economy of the West "while upgrading protection of the environment."  </P> <P> Californians often tend to look down on other western states as economic  stepchildren who have no choice but to deal with or through the Golden State on  trade matters. The state should consider the benefits of participation in the  Center for the New West. The economic vigor of places like Denver, Salt Lake  City, Phoenix and Honolulu will contribute to California's health as well. And  California -- as a resource exploiter of the West -- should work with other  western states on environmental protection and cultural development.  </P></p>

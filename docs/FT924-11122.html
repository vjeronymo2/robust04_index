			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Action threat over Cuba trade bar THE EC may consider retaliatory action against US attempts to reinforce its trade embargo on Cuba. President Bush approved the Cuban Democracy Act last weekend. The EC had warned the act might break international trade law. A Brussels spokesman said: 'Mr Frans Andriessen (trade commissioner) regrets Mr Bush's decision.' EC officials were examining the legislation to see if retaliatory action was necessary, possibly under Gatt or OECD rules. The Commission is concerned the act would force US and Cuban trading partners to comply with US prohibitions on trade, even if they lie outside US jurisdiction.</p>

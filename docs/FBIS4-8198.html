			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic by </F> announcer Peter Snow; Snow in London studio, Silajdzic in  Sarajevo; from the "Newsnight" program -- live]    [Text] [Snow] Mr. Silajdzic, what do you hear about the  situation around Goradze tonight? Is it quiet?    [Silajdzic] Yes, I spoke with them at 10 tonight -- our time  tonight -- and they said that actually the attacks on Goradze  intensified after the air strikes. Now it's rather quiet, but  I'm afraid that those people are looking for a very difficult  and tense night tonight and God knows only what happens tomorrow.    [Snow] But it is your judgment that the air strikes may have  been enough and may now have done the trick and stopped the Serb  attack on Goradze?    [Silajdzic] The air strikes were too late, too limited to  impress the Serbs. They obviously were not impressed for they  intensified, as I said, their attacks on Goradze today.  Twenty-five people died after the air strikes, and I must say  that torture of Goradze people must stop. Either by the UN and  Nato action, or by lifting the arms embargo for the Bosnian's so  as we can defend ourselves.    [Snow] Now how about the Russian Foreign Ministry's  suggestion today that UN peacekeepers now going, if General Rose  can find the peacekeepers to go in there, go into Goradze and  disarm both sides, the Serbs and your own soldiers, Bosnian  government soldiers, in Goradze?    [Silajdzic] Well that's disarming the victim. So the Serbs  who were attacking Goradze for 15 days, attacking the safe zone,  attacking civilian areas, attacking the UNPROFOR base, and now  they should be disarmed together with their victims. And I  heard on the news that Russian Minister Kozyrev said that this  was a dreadful mistake. So the 15 days of killing civilians is  not a mistake. Don't human lives mean anything anymore? So,  the Serbs will have to withdraw to the exclusion zone lines in  order for the peace negotiations to be continued.    [Snow] Well now, that's what the Americans appear to be  saying as well. If the Serbs do now relax their pressure, if  they do now stop, and if they are ready for ceasefire talks, are  you ready to do that too?    [Silajdzic] Well, as soon as they withdraw, because they  attacked the safe zone, as soon as they withdraw behind the  exclusion zone lines to be established by the Security Council,  of course we are ready to talk. The problem was that they were  saying they were ready to talk and applying the tactics of  talking and negotiating. We warned General Rose from the very  beginning that this was their tactics.    [Snow] But you will talk Mr. Silajdzic about a ceasefire all  over Bosnia provided this attack on Goradze stops? Is that  right, you will do that?    [Silajdzic] I'm sorry, will you repeat the question?    [Snow] You are prepared to sit down and talk with the Serbs  and General Rose about a ceasefire over the whole of Bosnia if  the pressure on Goradze stops, is that right?    [Silajdzic] Not if the pressure on Goradze stops, when they  withdraw behind the lines of the exclusion zone, that means 20  kms in the radius around Goradze, then we are ready to sit and  talk yes.    [Snow] Thank you very much, Mr. Silajdzic.</p>

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): The Revenue won't write I AM A non-resident UK citizen (I live in France) with a relatively small amount of British income. But I make a UK tax return since I get an annual rebate of a few hundred pounds on tax deducted from dividends. From 1991/92 on, I have had some income from literary composition written abroad and published in the UK. For the past 12 months, I have tried without success to obtain information from the Inland Revenue on what expenses I can deduct from my royalties. Can you tell me? And how can I persuade the Revenue to answer my letters? Under article 12 of the France-UK double taxation convention (as amended in 1987) you are entitled to exemption from UK tax on your royalties. Write for a claim form to the Inspector of Foreign Dividends, Lynwood Road, Thames Ditton, Surrey KT7 0DP, mentioning the reference number under which your claims have been dealt with (or rather not dealt with) at the Foreign Claims Branch. At the same time, you might like to ask for a copy of the free pamphlet IR120 (You and the Inland Revenue). Incidentally, you are not strictly correct in talking about 'tax deducted from dividends.' UK dividends have been paid without deduction of tax since April 6 1973. What you have been claiming is a payment of tax credit: the distinction between tax credit and deducted income tax will become clear when you submit your claim for tax credit in respect of dividends paid during the present tax year. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

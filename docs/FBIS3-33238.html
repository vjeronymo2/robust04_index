			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Santa Fe de Bogota, 18 Feb (DPA) -- It was  learned today in Santa Fe de Bogota that residents of Tumaco, a  port on the southern coast of Colombia, have charged that U.S.  soldiers are allegedly conducting operations in that area.    The charges made to EL ESPECTADOR reporters in Narino  Department, where Tumaco is located, state that soldiers,  wearing uniforms with the acronym "USA" on them, have even been  asking residents of the area for their identification papers.    According to several residents of that port town, the  soldiers, who "are tall, well-built, and blond-haired" have  conducted "sudden patrols" of the town, supposedly while  conducting antidrug trafficking operations.    The alleged actions of the foreign soldiers adds yet another  ingredient to the problem Colombia is facing because of the  presence of some 150 U.S. soldiers in Juanchaco, a small town  located along the Pacific coast but quite removed from Tumaco,  where, according to official reports, they are building a school  and health center.    The soldiers arrived in Colombia in early January and their  arrival unleashed a heated debate that included the State  Council asking congress to investigate President Cesar Gaviria  for violating the country's sovereignty.

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Fujitsu and Sharp in multimedia alliance Fujitsu, Japan's largest manufacturer of computers, and Sharp, the consumer electronics maker, yesterday announced an alliance to develop new products based on mobile communications, information processing and imaging. The move comes as Japan's electronics industry is beginning to position itself for the emerging market for products which transcend the traditional boundaries of computing, telecommunications and consumer electronics. The so-called multimedia market is expected to grow rapidly over the next few years, providing new product possibilities for consumer electronics companies finding it difficult to sustain a flow of new ideas and for computer manufacturers hit by falling profit margins. The first development by Fujitsu and Sharp will be a mobile telecommunications system allowing users of 'Zaurus', a hand-held computer made by Sharp, to tap into, and extract information from, a data network operated by Fujitsu. The two companies said they would be working on ways to ensure their products could be connected: 'We will work together to develop advanced technologies in devices and interfaces that can become industry standards.' The alliance brings together two companies with recognised strengths in areas expected to be crucial to the development of advanced multimedia products. Fujitsu is a leader in information processing and communications systems technologies. Sharp, for its part, has become dominant in liquid crystal display panels, and has experience in new personal information tools software through its agreement with Apple to manufacture the US company's personal digital assistant. Fujitsu could learn from Sharp's speed of development and its ability to bring out hit products, said Mr Mikio Ohtsuki, Fujitsu vice-president. Fujitsu has been attempting to move increasingly into the consumer market with the launch last year of a multimedia machine which confers the capabilities of a personal computer on an ordinary TV. Fujitsu already provides Sharp with semiconductors while Sharp supplies Fujitsu with liquid crystal display panels. However, the two companies have no plans to co-operate in these fields.</p>

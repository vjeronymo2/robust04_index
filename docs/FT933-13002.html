			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / International Company News: Sharp rise in second-term earnings at Monsanto MONSANTO, the US chemicals group, yesterday unveiled a sharp rise in second-quarter earnings led by a strong performance by its agricultural businesses. This more than offset a decline in underlying operating income from its chemical segment and lower operating income from its NutraSweet artificial sweetener operations. Net income was Dollars 200m, or Dollars 1.66 a share, on sales of Dollars 2.23bn, compared with Dollars 105m, or 86 cents, on sales of Dollars 2.05bn last year. Operating income climbed to Dollars 326m in the latest quarter from Dollars 185m. Operating income from the agricultural group rose more than 50 per cent to Dollars 258m, adjusted for a pre-tax charge of Dollars 19m last year. Mr Richard Mahoney, chairman and chief executive, said: 'The single largest contributor to worldwide agricultural growth this year has been the rapid adoption of minimum tillage techniques by farmers, a trend which was further accelerated by exceptional weather conditions.' Agricultural sales grew to Dollars 743m from Dollars 532m. Operating income from Monsanto's chemical group rose to Dollars 75m from Dollars 59m, but the 1992 quarter included a pre-tax extraordinary charge of Dollars 41m. The company blamed weak economic conditions in Europe and Japan for the performance of its chemical operations. Chemical sales slipped to Dollars 933m from Dollars 967m. The Searle pharmaceutical unit posted an operating loss of Dollars 37m, against a loss of Dollars 53m last year, while sales rose to Dollars 368m from Dollars 314m. NutraSweet recorded operating income of Dollars 42m on sales of Dollars 186m, compared with Dollars 48m on sales of Dollars 232m. First-half net income was Dollars 341m, or Dollars 2.83, on sales of Dollars 4.17bn, against a net deficit of Dollars 283m, or Dollars 2.30, on sales of Dollars 4.02bn a year ago. Stripping out the impact of accounting charges, Monsanto earned Dollars 257m in the 1992 period.</p>

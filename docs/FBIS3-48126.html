			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 22 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, undaunted by Friday's [21 January] rejection of his  political reform legislation package by the House of  Councillors, still aims to attain the goal within a week, his  associates said Saturday. Hosokawa, in meetings with his  supporters who called at his official residence Saturday,  expressed his resolve to accomplish reforms.    Hosokawa, who came to power last August, took a stinging  blow  Friday when the upper house voted against a package of four  political reform bills with a vote of 118 for and 130 against.    Hosokawa stated last year he will take responsibility if he  fails to bring about political reforms by the end of that year.  But he extended the deadline to the end of the current session  of the Diet due to expire January 29.    He still has one full week until the end of the current Diet  session to work out a compromise through negotiations with the  opposition camp and to enact political reform bills.    Koki Ishii, a member of the Japan New Party which the prime  minister leads, said Hosokawa has no plan to dissolve the House  of Representatives and call for a snap general election.    Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata said  in a lecture in Fukuoka on the southern main island of Kyushu on  Saturday there still is a chance to get political reforms  approved by the Diet. "What is important now is to realize  reforms. If both ruling and opposition sides are willing to do  so, reform bills will be attained," he said.    To revive the political reform program, amendments need to  be  made by a joint council of 10 members each from both houses for  approval by plenary sessions of both houses before the current  Diet session ends.    Hata said Hosokawa will continue to pursue his goal instead  of resigning his post because his cabinet still enjoys a  popularity rating of over 50 percent.    Home Affairs Minister Kanju Sato, speaking in Tsu, Mie  Prefecture, said the ruling coalition is ready to compromise  with the opposition Liberal Democratic Party to carry out  political reforms.    Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the LDP's Policy Affairs  Research Council, blamed Hosokawa's performance for Friday's  upper house decision.    He said the dissolution of the lower house is unrealistic in  view of pressing diplomatic and domestic affairs, such as a  summit between Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton and  formulation of the fiscal 1994 budget.    Shin Sakurai, a deputy secretary general of the LDP, said he  will go all out to kill the reform bills although he favors the  enactment of an anticorruption law.    Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party  (SDP), addressing an emergency meeting of the party's central  executive committee, expressed deep regret at the upper house  action and the party as the largest group in the ruling  coalition has to take the blame for it.    While declining to make clear whether he will step down as  party leader to take responsibility for the failure, he said he  will continue efforts to bring about political reforms.    In a related development, Michio Watanabe, a former foreign  minister and leader of one of the LDP's five major factions,  appeared on a television program and called for a two-step  reform with priority placed on prevention of corruption,  followed by a change in the election system.    Political sources said Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and  Komeito, both in the ruling coalition, consider it unavoidable  to make bold concessions to the LDP to get the political reform  package through the Diet. Such a move, however, will face  strong resistance from the SDP, which is widely split over the  reform package, they said.</p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> CRIMINAL TYPE LOOKS NEAR UNBEATABLE FOR HORSE-OF-YEAR HONOR  </P> <P> Housebuster and Go for Wand are on his heels in the Horse-of-the-Year race, but  with the Breeders' Cup approaching, the title is Criminal Type's to lose. It  has been so since his victories over Easy Goer in the Met Mile and Sunday  Silence in the Hollywood Gold Cup were followed by the retirements of both.  Suddenly, the muscular, deep-girthed Criminal Type, a 5-year-old who has taken  late development to a new frontier, was alone and brandishing a streak of three  Grade I victories going into the Whitney Handicap on Aug. 4 at Saratoga.  </P> <P> Five opposed him that day, none with a prayer of outrunning the former middling  allowance horse turned behemoth of the handicap division. This is an animal who  was anonymous at age 2, nondescript at 3 and forgettable at 4, when he earned  less than $67,000. But by midsummer of his fifth year, Criminal Type looked  unbeatable.  </P> <P> Having won hard-fought, photo-finish decisions over Housebuster in the Met Mile  and Sunday Silence in the Hollywood Gold Cup, he won the Whitney as he pleased  in a quickly run 9 furlongs, an effort comparable to his other victories.  </P> <P> In Saturday's Woodward Handicap, Criminal Type will encounter Rhythm, winner of  the Travers Stakes, the high point of a largely disappointing season for last  year's 2-year-old champion; Dispersal, who has not raced in New York since  taking the NYRA Mile last fall at Aqueduct but who is on a more modest streak  of his own; two California shippers who may have Breeders' Cup aspirations;  Thirty Six Red, who has spent the summer attempting to recapture his spring  form, and a few others whose prospects appear dim at best.  </P> <P> On paper, the Woodward looks much like a repeat of the Whitney. The distance, 9  furlongs, is probably Criminal Type's best, and the stakes are much larger than  the winner's share of a $500,000 purse.  </P> <P> A Woodward victory would be of substantial importance to Criminal Type's  Horse-of-the-Year prospects and his value as a progenitor of the breed for his  owner, Calumet Farm. It also increases the already considerable value of his  wildly successful sire, Alydar, who stands at Calumet.  </P> <P> A loss in a race Criminal Type is expected to win easily could be overcome in  the Jockey Club Gold Cup and Breeders' Cup Classic. A defeat, however, would  allow no margin for setback in light of the seasons being enjoyed by the  3-year-old filly Go for Wand and Housebuster, who in many eyes became the  leading 3-year-old male with his overpowering performance in the Jerome  Handicap despite his absence from the Triple Crown and the Travers.  </P> <P> The Woodward is the first significant race of the fall meeting at Belmont that  has substantial Breeders' Cup implications. Rhythm, winner of the Breeders' Cup  Juvenile last year, is a candidate for the Classic but must duplicate his  come-from-behind Travers effort if he is to be taken seriously as a threat. Not  even his connections are certain he will.  </P> <P> Having coped with an erratic Rhythm, who raced close to the pace throughout the  summer, trainer Shug McGaughey and jockey Craig Perret elected to allow the  colt to relax early and finish with one long run, which resulted in a solid if  not altogether convincing victory. It worked at Saratoga. "Now, we have to hope  it will work again," McGaughey said.  </P> <P> But like the ultimate title that trainer D. Wayne Lukas and Calumet Farm seek  for Criminal Type, the Woodward is his to lose. Criminal Type put a signature  to the preparation Tuesday with a 5-furlong move in 0:59 2/5 that was almost  effortless. "He's been working fast since the Whitney," assistant trainer Jeff  Lukas said. "It falls into his pattern. He's been a good work horse in the last  four or five months."  </P> <P> In the last four or five months, he's been an indomitable racehorse.  </P></p>

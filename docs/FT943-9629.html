			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Arts: 'The Street of Crocodiles' - a riveting dream - Theatre The Street of Crocodiles - Theatre de Complicite's 1992 stage adaptation of stories by Bruno Schulz, currently back in London after one round of international tours and before another - is a riveting, bewildering dream. It has a dream's crazy jumps from one kind of reality to another, and the heightened bizarrerie of a dream too. What kind of dream it is changes while we watch: illusion, reverie, nightmare. The work is not in every respect a success. Many of its details are confusing; a great deal of the scenario published in the programme will come as a surprise to those who only read up after the performance (myself included); certain scenes are too prolonged; and the cartoon grotesquerie of the characterisations becomes sometimes wearying. Yet it has a peculiarly compelling stage life, with its own weird inner logic. The hero, Joseph, is a lone figure at work in a library. He opens certain books; his thoughts take wing. Now he is teacher to a class of unruly pupils, now son and brother to the members of his own eccentric family, now a forlorn lover forever pursuing one girl through the whirling world. In his mind, however, it is the members of his family household who people all the scenes he imagines or remembers. In particular, he is haunted by his father, an intelligent man forever in flight from the minutiae of daily existence and in pursuit of larger realms of thought. 'Wood is alive,' proclaims his father amid the carpentry class he is trying to teach; and - his idee fixe - 'The migration of souls is the essence of life.' Joseph backs his father, even when his father's obsession with birds, books, and the life of the mind, makes domestic existence intolerable for almost everyone else. At one point during the central dinner scene, the members of the family turns into his father's birds; at another, they turn into his impertinent pupils in the schoolroom. I never understood why some of this German family spoke in Spanish. Or why, in one episode, the maid Adela has an extra pair of shoes attached to her ankles. Or why, early on, we see a man - seemingly in defiance of gravity, body parallel to the floor - walking slowly down a wall towards the floor. Yet such deranged details as these help to give Street of Crocodiles its perverse vitality. Other details have a resonant poetry. When the 'pupils' all round up against poor Joseph and strike him round the stage, his staggered, flailing, retreat acquires the rhythm of a crazy dance. When the maid Adela attacks the household's junior menfolk who pester her one summer, she chases them like flies - whereupon Joseph's father, the constant bane of her prosaic existence, becomes a vast wasp, hovering the more angrily for her aggression. When, finally, Joseph tries to keep the world out of his father's once magical shop, the people beat on the door and start to sing a polyphonic chorale that turns into, of all things, 'Worthy is the Lamb that was slain': which in turn prepares us for the way they will assail him and sacrifice him. What helps Street of Crocodiles most is the cast. The whole ensemble is brilliantly committed, and there are some first-rate individual performances. Outstanding is Cesar Sarachu as Joseph. It is the devout economy of his playing that stops this work from ever becoming too overwrought; his sincerity and innocence place into perspective all the oddballs around him. Finest of these is Lilo Baur as the maid Adela. Her impatience with his father's unworldly and unrealistic ways creates immense tension round the home; she is a perpetual dynamo - a smouldering, even demonic, force, even though she appears to champion conventional values. Simon McBurney directs, and also adapted the stories (with co-director, Mark Wheatley). Thanks largely to him, Theatre de Complicite has become one of Britain's flagship companies. The irony about this is that its performing style - full of heightened mime and caricature, with exaggerations and repetitions, underlining points in a method that is basically expressionistic - is highly European. Though some of its performers are British, few British virtues or vices are in evidence. Is it a sign of things to come that one of our most individual troupes looks as if it derives from the other side of the Channel? At the Young Vic until September 3.</p>

For each associated person who is named, the surcharge shall be assessed against the member or members which employed the associated person at the time of the events which gave rise to the dispute, claim or controversy. No member shall be assessed more than a single surcharge in any arbitration proceeding. The surcharge shall not be subject to reimbursement under Subsections 43(c) or 44(c) of the Code. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) For the purposes of this Section, service is perfected when the Director of Arbitration properly serves the Respondents to such proceeding under Subsection 25(a) of the Code. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On February 25, 1994, the NASD filed SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;11 adopting section 45 to the Code of Arbitration Procedure (``Code'') to impose a $200 non-refundable surcharge on any member named as a party to an arbitration proceeding. The last line of section 45(a) stated that the surcharge would not be subject to reimbursement under Subsection 43(c) of the Code, which references customer disputes. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33731 (March 8, 1994), 59 FR 11817 (March 14, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subsequently, the NASD determined that it had inadvertently omitted reference in the last sentence of new section 45(a) to Subsection 44(c), which provision relates to industry and clearing controversies. The NASD is, therefore, proposing to amend Subsection 45(a) to the Code of Arbitration Procedure to clarify that the member surcharge is not subject to reimbursement under Subsections 43(c) and 44(c) of the Code. Thus, the provision of Subsection 45(a) that the member surcharge is not subject to reimbursement shall apply in cases involving customer disputes as well as industry and clearing controversies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of section 15A(b)(5) of the Act, <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  which require that the rules of the Association provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and other charges among members in that the proposed rule clarifies that the member surcharge will be assessed equitably on each member who is named and for whom service is perfected in an arbitration proceeding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78o&hyph;3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants, or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments were neither solicited nor received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III.

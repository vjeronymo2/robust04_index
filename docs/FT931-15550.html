			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / International Company News: Maxwell administrators sell stake in travel agent THE joint administrators of the private side of the empire of the late Mr Robert Maxwell have sold their remaining 50 per cent shareholding in Thomas Cook Travel, the Massachusetts-based travel business that used to be wholly-owned by Mr Maxwell. The buyer of the company - which last year had Dollars 1.7bn of turnover - is Mr David Paresky, the chairman who since 1989 has owned 50 per cent of Thomas Cook Travel. Mr Paresky and his wife now own 100 per cent of the business. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Mr Maxwell bought Thomas Cook Travel in 1988, and a year later agreed to link the business with Crimson Travel, Mr Paresky's company, with the pooled operation trading under the Thomas Cook name. Thomas Cook Travel, the third-largest US travel agency chain, employs 3,000 and has 500 offices across the US. It also has a relationship with the worldwide Thomas Cook network.</p>

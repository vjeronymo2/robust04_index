			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOW TO GET AROUND ORANGE COUNTY WITHOUT USING A CAR  </P> <P> The thought of getting around Orange County in any manner other than private  automobile is rarely considered by residents if they can avoid it.  </P> <P> But there are alternatives. Consider:  </P> <P> * Amtrak makes stops at Fullerton, Anaheim, Santa Ana, Irvine, San Juan  Capistrano and San Clemente. In Irvine, the trains make three northbound  departures and another three departures southbound during weekdays; on  weekends, there are only two departures in either direction. There is only one  daily northbound departure from San Clemente, and two daily southbound stops.  </P> <P> For information about fares or the train schedule, call (800) USA-RAIL.  </P> <P> * Buses in Orange County are a surprise to many. Bus schedules are available to  passengers and more often than not the buses arrive on time. Bus-stop signs are  spaced every two or three blocks along the routes. The bus will stop if a  person signals that he or she is awaiting a ride. Exact fare or a bus pass is  required: Drivers do not carry change.  </P> <P> Regular fare at all times is 90 cents. It is 45 cents for seniors and the  handicapped during weekday peak hours (6 to 9 a.m., 3 to 6 p.m.) and 15 cents  at all other times. The blind may ride for free.  </P> <P> Orange County Transit District telephone operators provide bus times and will  also send free bus schedules. They field calls at (714) 636-RIDE from 6 a.m. to  7 p.m. weekdays; 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekends. From south Orange County (cities  south of Irvine) call (714) 496-4623. And TDD service for the hearing-impaired  is available at (714) 636-HEAR or 636-4327. The information center is closed on  holidays.  </P> <P> For the handicapped, the blind and the wheelchair-bound, dial-a-ride service  has been the answer, particularly for patients traveling to or from a hospital  or doctor. However, trip distances on dial-a-ride vans are limited within the  boundaries of small zones, each covering a few square miles.  </P> <P> Fares are 90 cents for senior citizens and the disabled per zone and $1.80 per  zone for all others. A dial-a-ride transfer to another zone doubles the cost of  the trip. For bus or dial-a-ride information, phone (714) 636-7433.  </P> <P> * For people without a car and the desire to use public transportation, another  answer is the car/van pool. Assistance is provided by the Transit District's  commuter network. Information regarding schedules and home/job areas is entered  into a computer, which then matches the starting points, destinations and work  schedules and provides individual names and contact phone numbers. After that  it's up to the principals to arrange the pool, including financial  arrangements. The Transit District follows up to see if pools are working. If  not, the computer will be asked to expand the so-called "home grid" to see if  there are other possible matches. For information, call (714) 636-7433.  </P> <P> * Laguna Beach Municipal Transit offers a trolley service within city limits.  This service costs 50 cents and can take a passenger anywhere within the buses'  complete circle tour of Laguna Beach. During the Festival of the Arts, the cost  is 75 cents one way, or $2.50 for a full-day pass. For information, phone (714)  497-3311.  </P> <P> * If public transportation is inconvenient, or if you require immediate travel,  a taxi may be the next best thing to driving your own car, if cost is not a  hardship. Taxicabs are generally available within 15 minutes. The taxi's meter  starts at $1.90 and 20 cents is charged for each one-seventh of a mile,  amounting to $3.30 for the first mile; $1.60 for each mile thereafter.  </P> <P> Coast Yellow Cab service for Costa Mesa, Tustin, El Toro, Westminster, Fountain  Valley, Newport Beach, Huntington Beach, Mission Viejo, Laguna Niguel, Laguna  Hills and Irvine is available by calling (714) 546-4942 or (714) 546-1311.  Yellow Cab service is available within specific cities; for additional numbers,  check local telephone listings.  </P> <P> Source: Individual transportation agencies ELENA BRUNET  </P></p>

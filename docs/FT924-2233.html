			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Leading Article: EC pulls back from brink THE EC drew back from the brink at Edinburgh because its leaders saw all too clearly the risk of falling over the precipice. Sensible compromises, above all over the Community budget and the Danish question, have re-assembled the Twelve around their core aim of political and economic integration. But the interpretation of how, and during what period, this objective is to be achieved is now, in most parts of the EC, less ambitious, and therefore more achievable, than that outlined a year ago at Maastricht. Mr John Major can take pride in winding up Britain's problem-strewn EC presidency with agreements restoring a sense of EC balance and purpose. Anything else would have wrought devastating harm to the Community's image and its ability to deliver policies, both internally and externally. Not least, failure in Edinburgh would have damaged chances of forging a strong relationship with the new US administration, and of helping alleviate chaos in Russia and other parts of eastern Europe. Yet the return of consensus in no way guarantees that the EC can avoid turbulence. Enlargement talks with Austria, Finland and Sweden are to get under way from next month. But the EC needs as much as ever to prove that it is a club worth joining. The resolve displayed in Scotland must be translated into action. This applies not only to the task of making the concept of 'subsidiarity' both efficient, and meaningful to ordinary people. The EC must also ensure a positive outcome to the Gatt talks, a subject left off the Edinburgh agenda. Currency disorder On the economic front, the path towards economic and monetary union (Emu) now looks less clear than a year ago. But this increases the urgency for the EC to focus efforts on attacking the causes of the instability which forced Britain's and Italy's departure from the exchange rate mechanism. Both in tackling currency disorder and in curing the Community's most pressing difficulty - lack of economic growth - there can be few grounds for optimism unless Germany rectifies disequilibrium caused by mismanagement of its economic reunification. As long as this primary EC fault line remains, economic initiatives such as the infrastructure programme agreed in Edinburgh will be little more than palliatives. With the formal entry into operation of the 'single market' next month, the EC has put into place measures which represent potentially the best long-term way of allowing the Community to flourish. But without greater confidence in shorter-term economic prospects - which would be improved by lower German interest rates - the 1993 programme will yield less than optimal results. Without a resumption of growth, the EC's budgetary problems, patched up in spite of histrionics from Mr Felipe Gonzalez, may resurface. The Emu convergence targets will be still more difficult to achieve. Most important of all, the EC's failure to make a real contribution to eastern European revival will start to become not merely embarrassing but, conceivably, a disaster. No schism If the Edinburgh meeting has re-established realism about the pace and scope of the Maastricht journey towards closer integration, it has also resolved some doubts about who will be taking part. France and Germany have expended much rhetoric about the need to prevent the Community from being over-influenced by countries most sceptical about the Maastricht process. It is clear that the move to Emu can only take place at two, or several speeds. Yet Edinburgh demonstrated that there will be no fundamental schism. Denmark achieved its sought-after exemptions from pivotal parts of Maastricht, while Britain withstood pressure to agree a July 1993 ultimatum for securing the treaty's ratification. Since it can reasonably be assumed that both Denmark and the UK will indeed ratify the treaty next year, the overall agenda for Community policies will continue to be set by the Twelve, augmented by members of the European Free Trade Association (Efta) from the mid-1990s onwards. The treaty is far from perfect. But in setting out a framework for more effective co-operation, it represents the EC's best opportunity for enacting policies increasing stability and prosperity across the whole of Europe.</p>

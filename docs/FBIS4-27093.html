			<p>BFN     [Text] President Ramos says the expulsion of two Irish  nationals who arrived Saturday night to attend the East Timor  conference was compelled by the national interest. The  president stressed that the government is pursuing a peace  process to heal the divisions among the Filipino people. Nobel  Peace Prize awardee Mairead Corrigan and Tom (Highland) were  deported immediately after they arrived the NAIA [Ninoy Aquino  International Airport] last evening. Corrigan is an activist  like (Highland).    University of the Philippines [UP] Chancellor Roger Posadas  has instructed university officials to disallow organizers and  participants of the Asia-Pacific Conference on the East Timor or  APCET from using UP's premises, grounds, and facilities.  Posadas directive contained in Memorandum No. 94-100 dated 27  May was in compliance with the restraining order issued by the  Quezon City Regional Trial Court temporarily preventing the  conduct of APCET within and outside the university. The  chancellor's memorandum was addressed to all university deans,  directors, department chairs, heads of offices and hostel  managers. The university officials concerned are now preparing  the formal position that will be presented to the court on this  case at the appropriate time.</p>

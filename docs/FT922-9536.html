			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Switzerland (1): Gear after neutral - The government has firmly committed itself to joining the European Community. Line is overdrawn But doubts remain about whether the inhabitants of neutral Switzerland will want to follow this lead THE TIME for decisions has at last arrived. Over the next year, the Swiss will be called upon, after years of debate and soul-searching, to take a number of decisions that will set the framework for their relations with the rest of Europe and the rest of the world for the foreseeable future. At stake is whether the country will continue to pursue its detached stance, maintaining strict neutrality and avoiding foreign alignments. Or will it adopt a more conventional role for a small, landlocked, resource-poor country of 6.8m people, and join formally with its neighbours in building the European Community of the future? Opinion polls have consistently indicated that the Swiss are sharply divided on these questions, worried, on the one hand, that if they remain detached, their highly developed industrial base will suffer and their much-envied standard of living will decline. These worries are understandably acute at a time when the Swiss economy is having difficulty pulling out of a year-long recession, when inflation is uncharacteristically high and the country's role as a financial haven seems to be disappearing. But the Swiss are strongly attached to their decentralised style of self-government and they fear that their interests would be not be well-protected in an organisation such as the European Commission. They dread a further rush of immigrants and foreign property buyers if the country has to accept the EC principle of freedom of movement of people. It would be wrong to overdramatise the distance between the two options on offer. Even if it decides to maintain its autonomy, Switzerland would not be isolated or aloof from the problems of its continent or the world. It already participates as a non-member in the activities of most international organisations; it has an increasingly liberal and open economy and it shares the burdens of refugees that strain most western European countries these days. More than 16 per cent of Swiss residents are non-Swiss. Conversely, if the Swiss decide to move towards joining the European Community, they will still be able to maintain - at least at the local level  -their unique and cherished political structures. The decision-making process on these issues begins as early as next week when the Swiss will vote in a plebiscite on whether their country should at last join the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. This will be the first test of Swiss sentiment towards international organisations since a majority rejected a proposal in 1986 to join the United Nations. In the meantime, Switzerland startled many observers by joining in the UN-led coalition to roll back Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. A few weeks ago, it joined the sanctions against Libya over airline terrorism. In the autumn, the people will vote in another plebiscite on a mammoth project to drill two new rail tunnels through the Alps. This project, called NEAT, is the Swiss government's contribution to trying to solve the inflammatory dispute that pits Austria and Switzerland against the EC over the use of Swiss roads by EC lorries moving between Italy and Germany. The EC and the Alpine countries reached a comprehensive agreement on the problem late last year, subject to ratification by the Swiss and Austrians. The importance of the agreement for EC-Swiss relations is great enough in itself, but other factors make it even more important. For one thing, it includes an air traffic agreement, which is vital to the survival of Swissair, the Swiss national airline, especially if Switzerland later decides not to join the EC. The treaty is also part of the transport element in the agreement between the six European Free Trade Area (Efta) countries, including Switzerland, and the EC that was initialled last month to create what is called the European Economic Area (EEA). So if the NEAT proposal is rejected by Swiss voters, Switzerland will have reneged on its commitments under the EEA treaty. The final referendum of interest is on the EEA itself. This was originally going to be held in December, but because parts of the agreement had to be rewritten early this year to overcome the objections of the European Court of Justice, completion was delayed and so the referendum must be postponed until May 1993. The vote on the EEA has taken on increased importance since the federal cabinet's declaration last autumn that it considers the EEA nothing more than a first step towards full EC membership. Thus, the ground has been cut from under those Swiss who like the idea of the EEA - essentially a free trade area - but do not like the EC, at least in its present form. Since the cabinet's declaration, some political and business leaders have argued that the country should put in its application to join the EC immediately rather than wait for the EEA referendum result. They say that speed is of the essence if the country is to sit around the table with the likes of Sweden, Austria, Norway and Finland rather than having to apply in a few years' time with Czechoslovakia, Turkey and Hungary. In particular, the Swiss would like to be involved in the resolution of how neutral countries' interests will be protected in the EC. This will be sorted out in the negotiations with Austria, Sweden and Finland, so if Switzerland is not present, it will have to accept the same terms when and if it applies at a later point. There is also a tactical point. Some argue that if a majority of the Swiss vote against joining the EEA in next May's referendum, it would be awkward for the government to turn around and apply immediately for EC membership. Thus, these people say, it would be smarter to put the application in now. Then, if the EEA referendum was lost, the government could just move on to the EC negotiations. Even though the federal government and most top business leaders are recommending that the people endorse all the above steps towards integration with the European Community and the world, it is far from certain that they will do so. The Swiss tend to be very practical voters and, according to one Zurich banker, they will probably vote against joining the Bretton Woods institutions simply because they do not see what they will get out of them. Attitudes toward Europe are more complex and varied. In general, the Swiss do not like what they see as the concentration of more and more jurisdiction at the EC centre in Brussels. One is frequently told that if the EC were developing along the more decentralised lines that the British government has proposed, then the Swiss might be more enthusiastic. In the business community, the thousands of small wholesalers, retailers and contractors - not to mention farmers - who still benefit from protection from foreign competition obviously fear the potential arrival of the EC anti-cartel office and the Common Agricultural Policy. For totally different reasons, many of the country's large industrialists and bankers no longer seem terribly worried about the outcome, which means that they may feel free to vote with their hearts rather than their heads. This is because, at their level, life has already become very European and international. Switzerland exports 36 per cent of its output and imports an almost identical proportion of its consumption, with the great majority of its trade in both directions being with other European countries. Leading Swiss banks and industrial companies have large and successful operating bases abroad, and many leading EC companies, notably car makers, have substantial sales in Switzerland. More important, whatever unfair advantages they once enjoyed as a result of being based in Switzerland are rapidly being swept away. Perhaps the most significant of these advantages was the relatively closed Swiss capital market, which is now in serious decline. (Ironically, Swiss voters are expected to veto in yet another referendum later this year a government plan to help the capital markets by cutting an irritating stamp duty on securities transactions.) This decline has forced big companies to make their shares more accessible and attractive to foreigners and to become more transparent in their reporting so that they can attract foreign capital. In the past few months, several companies have split their shares and removed restrictions on foreign ownership. They are still feeling their way in the new, more liberal environment and there have been no hostile foreign takeovers of Swiss companies so far. Friendly sell-outs are starting to occur though. In January, German interests took control of the big Movenpick restaurants and hotels group and an Italian company took a strategic stake in the machinery group, Saurer. But one lesson that already seems to be emerging is that business will go on, whether or not companies are controlled by Swiss owners. It will also go on whether or not Switzerland joins the EC.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / International Company News: Cox backs new satellite channel COX Enterprises, the Atlanta-based media group, is to underwrite the Pounds 35m (Dollars 59.85m) funding requirements of UK Gold, a new satellite channel featuring programmes from the BBC and Thames Television. It is the first investment in the UK market for privately-owned Cox, one of the largest US communications groups with annual revenues of Dollars 2.3bn. Together with other investors, Cox, the sixth-largest cable television operator in the US, will also take a 65 per cent stake in the venture. Thames will have a 15 per cent stake and BBC Enterprises, the commercial arm of the BBC, 20 per cent. The new advertising-financed channel, which will be aimed entirely at the UK market, is likely to be launched in mid-November. It will broadcast for around 18 hours a day from the Astra satellite system to both satellite dishes and cable networks. The entertainment-only channel will draw heavily on the programme libraries of both the BBC and Thames. Mr Derek Lewis, former chief executive of the Granada group who is leading the UK Gold launch, said yesterday that he was delighted that Cox had underwritten the financing and would be a key partner in UK Gold.</p>

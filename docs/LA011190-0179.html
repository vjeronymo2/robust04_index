			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SISTER CITIES FUNDS SPENT PROPERLY,  AUDITORS FIND  </P> <P> More than $55,000 in public funds granted to a Sister Cities program overseen  by Juanita St. John were properly spent, despite some contract and accounting  irregularities, Los Angeles city auditors said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The money, approved by the City Council under two contracts, was intended to  help fund a July, 1986, international conference of city representatives at  Universal City, according to an audit released by City Controller Rick Tuttle.  </P> <P> The audit was ordered in part because St. John, a business associate of Mayor  Tom Bradley, is the focus of a criminal probe of possible misuse of funds in an  Africa trade task force. Auditors found the city's contract with the Sister  Cities group was vague, poorly monitored by the city clerk and some provisions  were violated, but that the money was appropriately expended.  </P></p>

In addition," Leotard  writes, "the government believes that aeronautics programs are a  top priority. Despite current financial and budget  difficulties, initial judgments by the prime minister on the  military programming law will allow us to continue defense  modernization."    Speaking to the National Assembly's Defense Committee,  Jean-Francois Bigay, president of the Eurocopter group, pointed  out that "the total cost of the NH-90 program would amount to  ECU1.376 billion," more than 9 billion French francs [Fr].  French participation comes to 42.4 percent (Fr1.3 billion by  Eurocopter and Fr3.9 billion by the state). "The unit cost of  the NH-90 helicopter will be Fr85 million" for the Land Army  version, "and Fr135 million" for the Navy version, Mr. Bigay  specified.    The four countries participating in the program (France,  Germany, The Netherlands, and Italy) have an overall requirement  for 726 helicopters, while the non-European export market is  estimated at approximately 500 "machines." The program is  currently severely threatened by military budget cuts in the  four participating countries.</p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Complaints made about adverts THE Advertising Standards Authority said yesterday that it started receiving complaints from the public about Land Travel in 1988. Most of the complaints concerned advertisements in the regional press and in brochures in travel agencies. Ms Caroline Crawford of the authority said: 'There have not been a massive amount of complaints but over the last 12 months we have published five reports on Land Travel, upholding complaints - which is above average for a travel company.' The authority has one complaint against Land Travel still under consideration. All complaints against the company to the authority have been upheld. The main complaints concerned the company's alleged failure to abide by stated tour itineraries. For instance, one trip to Czechoslovakia and Austria allegedly listed visits to Prague, Krakow and mountain castles but did not go to any of those places. Another trip, a coach tour to the Rhineland, said 'go and see Cologne's beautiful cathedral' but the coach allegedly drove straight through Cologne without stopping. Ms Crawford said: 'We found that Land Travel did in fact amend advertisements when we asked them but they were perhaps not careful enough that, at the time of going to press, their advertised itineraries were accurate.' The authority can issue warnings to the media which go to all advertising sales departments, requesting the media to seek its advice before accepting advertisements from troublesome companies. However, the authority does not disclose whether or not it takes such action against particular companies. A further sanction which the authority can invoke is a referral to the Office of Fair Trading - however there was no such referral in the case of Land Travel.</p>

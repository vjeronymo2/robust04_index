			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 20 (YONHAP) -- Some last-minute wavering  by Moscow in its decision to send a delegation to the first  meeting of the South Korea-Russian joint economic committee has  thrown Seoul officials into utter confusion. The meeting was to  open in Seoul Friday but less than 24 hours before the delegates  planned to get started, the Russian Government told Seoul it  could not send a delegation because of unspecified domestic  reasons.    Moscow then revised its decision and told Seoul it would  send  a delegation under a different leader. It changed its mind  again a short while later, however, saying it wouldn't send a  delegation after all.    Senior Korean Government officials were reportedly stunned  after receiving the first notice, because the meeting was  scheduled to be held as they were preparing for President Kim  Yong-sam's state visit to Russia. The Korean officials heaved a  collective sigh of relief when they received the second message,  only to be thrown into confusion again a few hours later.    After receiving the first message from Moscow, which said it  could not send a delegation led by Deputy Prime Minister  Aleksandr Shokhin, the Foreign Ministry even made an official  announcement to that effect. But the Russian Embassy in Seoul  asked the ministry to describe it not as "a cancellation" but as  "a suspension," saying it would provide further information two  to three hours later.    At 8 P.M. Thursday, the Russian side informed the ministry  that it would send a delegation led not by Shokhin but by  another deputy prime minister. Then three hours later at 11  P.M., the Russian Embassy told the ministry that no delegation  would be coming to Seoul after all.    Shortly afterward, the Russian Government phoned the Korean  Embassy in Moscow and proposed to hold an unofficial committee  meeting for two days in the Russian capital from May 30. But the  Korean side has decided that it would be meaningless to hold  such a meeting only a day before President Kim is scheduled to  start his visit to Russia.    On Friday, Korean Government officials were unable to find  out what those "domestic conditions" were. The most plausible  reason put forward by Korean officials appears to be "the  political realignment which is taking place in Moscow right  now," according to sources.</p>

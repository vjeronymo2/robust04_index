			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / US contract loss dismays French group GROUPE BULL, the French computer group, yesterday said it was 'very disappointed' that its subsidiary, Zenith Data Systems, had lost a Dollars 740m (Pounds 486.8m) contract to supply the US Air Force with desktop computers. US government arbitrators voided Zenith's contract on December 24 following complaints from rival bidders. The General Service Administration's Board of Contract Appeals did not spell out the reasons for its ruling, nor explain the next stage in the contract award. In an unusual move it decided to keep details of its ruling secret until next Monday. The contract has been embroiled in controversy for more than a year. It was initially awarded in November 1991 to CompuAdd Computer, a privately-owned company based in Austin, Texas, and Sysorex Information Systems, based in Virginia. The two companies lost the contract earlier this year after protests from Zenith and other losing bidders, which complained they had been unfairly disqualified from the race. The contract involves about 300,000 desktop computers, along with related software and peripherals, to be delivered over a three-year period. Ironically, the deal was meant to set a model for a new 'fast-track' method of bidding on US government contracts for computer equipment, designed to eliminate the problem of equipment becoming obsolete by the time the normally cumbersome procurement process has been completed.</p>

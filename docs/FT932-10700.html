			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Observer: Taking ways Becoming America's first black agriculture secretary is some achievement, but the only response Mike Espy's success has won from his parents is: 'We told you so.' It seems that, unlike the other children of the Mississippi Delta family, young Mike never had any idea what he wanted to do when he grew up. His parents therefore set him a test. In his absence, they laid on the table a Dollars 20 bill, a bible and a bottle of whisky, then waited to see which he'd pick up first on his return. Their idea was that if he chose the money, he'd be a banker; if the bible, a preacher; and if the whisky, ah well . . . Instead, however, he scooped up all three, tucking the bible under one arm, the bottle under the other, and sticking the bill in his pocket. 'Oh no] He's going to be a politician,' gasped his prescient parent.</p>

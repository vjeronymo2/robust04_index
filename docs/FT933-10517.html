			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Japan parties to apologise for war aggression JAPAN will seek a full reconciliation with its neighbours by making a clear apology for aggression during the second world war and properly compensating victims, Mr Tsutomu Hata, leader of the Japan Renewal party, promised yesterday. Mr Hata, likely to become deputy prime minister in Japan's new government, said relations with other Asian countries were still coloured by the past. The proposed coalition government believed there had to be an apology that would 'act as an historical punctuation mark,' Mr Hata said. His remarks were echoed by Ms Takako Doi, the former Social Democratic party leader, who agreed yesterday to become speaker of the lower house of parliament. The SDP and the Japan Renewal party are members of the seven-party coalition likely to form a new government tomorrow, ending the Liberal Democratic party's 38-year grip on power. Ms Doi, who will be the first woman to hold the position, said she had accepted the post in the hope of 'reactivating' Japanese politics and making the political process more open and less corrupt. Many supporters wanted her to reject the offer because the coalition includes former members of the LDP, and suggested she form a new party of her own. Japan's parliament is scheduled to vote tomorrow on a new prime minister, and the coalition leader, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, is expected to have the numbers to defeat Mr Yohei Kono, the leader of the Liberal Democratic party, which is likely to be pushed into opposition after nearly four decades in office. The coalition parties have made clear in policy statements that they consider the LDP has shown too little remorse over the war, and that a new administration would want a full reconciliation with Asian neighbours. Mr Hata said the government had been unable to find the right words to apologise sincerely for wartime brutality, and the time had come to send a clear message about the past so that the country could take an appropriate political role in the region.</p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Paper group shock Paper group Arjo Wiggins Appleton surprised the market by announcing the resignation of Mr Gordon Bond, chief executive of its printing and writings division, and the shares fell sharply in nervous reaction. They closed 23 down at 226p on heavy volume of 10m. Mr Bond joined the company in January and analysts said there had been no indication of any difference of opinion. When the statement came out, specialists were surprised by the lack of information it contained. Many read between the lines to see a conflict between Mr Bond and the French group St Louis, which holds a 40 per cent stake. There was also talk of a clash with Mr Alain Soulas, the French chief executive. The report from the Securities and Investments Board on the life and pensions industry impacted sharply on the life stocks, where Lloyds Abbey Life was the worst affected, finishing 19 cheaper at 412p, closely followed by groups such as Britannic, 9 weaker at 434p, Legal &amp; General, 18 down at 505p, and Prudential, which lost 9 to 345p. Criticisms of the life companies' selling methods, however, were said to be already reflected in share prices, according to leading insurance analysts. 'There will be a bounce in the life stocks from these levels,' said a specialist. The SIB report was said to have prompted a flurry of selling pressure in banks such as Lloyds, 9 off at 630p, and TSB, 5 cheaper at 240p, with both said to be affected by worries about life and pensions concerns. National Westminster dropped 16 to 581p on turnover of 4.1m after BZW was said to have adopted a more bearish stance on the shares, following similar recent moves by securities houses such as Hoare Govett and Kleinwort Benson. British Petroleum's investment seminar in New York, delivering essentially the same highly positive story as it did to European analysts in London on Wednesday, drew a good response from the US institutions. The latter, big buyers of BP shares over the past 15 months, moved in again to push the stock up to 348p, before it closed a net 9 1/2 ahead at 342 1/2 p. Turnover reached a hefty 25m shares, the highest single day's volume since the beginning of November. Analysts in London said the US institutions were worried about missing what could be a period of strong outper-formance by BP. News of cut-backs in crude oil output by Oman was said to have had little impact in the market yesterday. British Gas moved up 5 further to 360p on relatively small turnover of 8m shares as the market braced itself for imminent news from the president of the board of trade on the possible break-up of the company and a possible reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. SmithKline Beecham rose 14 to 395p in the 'A' stock and 6 to 358p in the units after Wednesday's late announcement that the company had received preliminary approval in the US for Kytril, its treatment for sickness in cancer patients. The units, which tend to reflect US interest, were heavily traded, with one block of 8m shares dealt at 343p making up most of the day's turnover of more than 13m. The 'A's saw more than 12m traded. Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome was volatile on a mixed reception to its agm. The shares were up 11 and down 7 before ending 4 off at 631p. The building materials sector of the market was one of the areas said to have been squeezed higher, with marketmakers acutely short of stock chasing share prices ahead to try to level their short positions. Big winners included Wolseley, 31 up at 864p, BPB, 9 dearer at 333p, BCI, 9 firmer at 345p, and Hepworth, which added 11 at 435p. RMC climbed 15 to 945p. Redland continued to shrug off the weakness prompted by the loss of the finance director earlier this week, closing 13 better at 585p. Housebuilders also gained substantial ground. Berkeley Group, which delivered above average results earlier this week, was 9 1/2 stronger at 507p. Vodafone moved against the overall trend, ending 5 lighter at 556p after Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank and one of Vodafone's bigger supporters over recent years, was said to have adopted a more cautious line. Spirits groups were lifted by the Gatt agreement, Guinness advancing 5 to 482p, Highland Distilleries 19 to 356p and Allied-Lyons 10 to 635p. Grand Metropolitan, which announ-ced slightly contentious executive changes this week, was again volatile, losing 8 to 443p. Among holiday operators, Owners Abroad reported a restructuring involving the loss of 260 jobs. The shares eased a penny to 79p. Analysts said the changes being wrought by the new management would have little effect until the 1995 season. Airtours unveiled a major rebranding of its booking operations. The shares appreciated 8 to 478p. Electrical retailer Dixons again lost ground, with Smith New Court said to have downgraded its profits forecasts. The shares slid 9 to 267p. Fashion company Jacques Vert announced that interim profits, at around Pounds 1.2m, would be better than expected when they are revealed in January. The stock jumped 27 to 179p.</p>

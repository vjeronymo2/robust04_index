			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Standard Chartered may lose Rs11bn STANDARD Chartered, the UK-based international bank, has an exposure of up to Rs10.55bn (Pounds 200m) in India's biggest securities scandal, according to a report published yesterday by the Reserve Bank, the country's central bank. Standard Chartered's shares dropped on news of the report, closing at 481p, down 17p. After the market closed, the bank issued a statement to the London Stock Exchange, saying that it still believed a Pounds 50m provision, already announced, was 'the best prudent assessment of the provisioning required'. Mr Malcolm Williamson, chief executive, said he had not seen the Reserve Bank report, but that it sounded as if it had focused on gross exposure, rather than net. Standard Chartered had 'hard, tangible security, which we don't believe is challengeable,' he said. Banks' possible losses from the scandal, put by the central bank at Rs30.8bn, stem from abuses of the interbank market. The Reserve Bank said that there had been 'massive collusion' between banks and brokers in the interbank market, adding: 'There has been a systematic diversion of funds from the banking system to the individual accounts of certain brokers.' The problems stemmed from bank's practice of issuing receipts to each other to guarantee delivery of securities. These receipts have become widely traded between banks, even though they are often not backed by underlying securities According to the report, Standard Chartered has paid out Rs3bn without having received any bankers' receipts or other securities to back the payments. It is also holding receipts from banks with a face value of Rs7.55bn 'for which the issuing banks do not appear to have sufficient backing'. Some Rs5.3bn of these related to the Metropolitan Co-operative Bank, described in the Reserve Bank report as 'a very small sized urban co-op bank' with less than Rs100m of assets. The remaining Rs2.25bn of receipts were issued by the Bank of Karad, a small private bank that has gone into liquidation. Its receipts 'have either no backing or backing of doubtful quality,' the central bank said. Mr Williamson said Standard Chartered was close to finishing its work of assessing the bank's security in Bombay. 'We've got about 15 trunkloads of hard security - it's not bankers receipts or IOUs.' He added: 'We know we've got some soft spots. We do have some outstandings to Bank Karad and Metropolitan Co-operative bank - I don't think that's any secret.'</p>

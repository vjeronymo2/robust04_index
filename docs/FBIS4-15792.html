			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by ITAr-TASS correspondent Irina Shchogoleva] </F>   [Text] Sochi April 11 TASS -- "First the United Nations  Security Council must adopt a resolution on the introduction of  the peacekeeping force to the area along the line of  confrontation between the Georgian and Abkhazian forces on the  Inguri river, and only after the peacekeepers are stationed, the  refugees can begin to return," said First Deputy Chairman of  Abkhazia's Council of Ministers Leonid Likerbaya.    He was commenting in an interview with ITAR-TASS on the  statement of the quadrilateral commission for the return of  refugees and displaced persons to Abkhazia, which was signed in  Sochi on April 9.    "We must make people understand that the process will be  long. It may take several years," said Lakerbaya. He expressed  confidence that it would do no good to try and artificially  accelerate the process, which could only provoke new clashes and  a new exacerbation of the situation. More, it is not ruled out  that the introduction of peacekeeping forces can extend in time,  leaving all decisions of the return of refugees "suspended in  midair".    "There is no need to out the cart before the horse. Let  documents be prepared thoroughly, so that they are fully ready  by the time the U.N. Security Council passes the required  resolution", Leonid Lakerbaya said.</p>

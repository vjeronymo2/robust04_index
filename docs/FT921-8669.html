			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Lancastrian rescue takeover LANCASTRIAN, a small, northern building society with 12 branches and Pounds 293m total assets, yesterday became the latest building society to surrender its independence after making a loss. The society is to be taken over by Northern Rock, the 11th largest society with assets of Pounds 4.5bn, but the merger must first be approved by a general meeting of Lancastrian's investors. The Building Societies Commission, the industry regulator, stepped in to organise a merger to protect investors under Section 33 of the 1986 Building Societies Act, after it became apparent that Lancastrian was going to make a loss of Pounds 1m this year as a result of losses on its Pounds 25m commercial lending book. It is understood to contain few bad debts. Lancastrian reported a loss of Pounds 1.5m on its building society activities in 1990, but the group made an overall post-tax profit of Pounds 468,000. Its main problem is that its free capital ratios, at about 2.5 per cent, are well below the 4 per cent industry average. Several societies were invited to submit proposals for the takeover. Northern Rock's main competitor is understood to have been Yorkshire. The takeover will enable Northern Rock to expand its branch network and customer base. Other small societies are expected to disappear in next few months after declaring a loss in 1991.</p>

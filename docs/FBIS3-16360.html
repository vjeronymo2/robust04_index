			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At the beginning of this month the All-Russia  Television and Radio Company was given notice by Mr. Belov,  general director of the Rostelekom joint-stock company, that the  acceptance and processing of orders for the provision of  intercity and international television and sound broadcasting  channels would be suspended from 15 March.    This means that Russian television and radio are unable to  have good-quality and stable communications with their  correspondents in any of the regions of our country. The  management of the Russian Television and Radio Company has held  intensive talks with Russian Communications Minister Vladimir  Bulgak, who gave the assurance that there would be no  disconnection from communications channels.    Today, however, the Rostelekom joint-stock company refused  to  accept and deal with orders from television and radio companies,  citing a directive from the joint-stock company's management.  All attempts today to talk to the Russian communications  minister have been unsuccessful, although, according to our  information, he had received information about the desperate  plight in which radio and television find themselves yet again.    It seems that today the language of the ultimatum is the  only  way in which Russian communications workers can voice their  interests.</p>

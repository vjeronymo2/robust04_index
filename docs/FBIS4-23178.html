			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Edyth Bulbring, Carmel Rickland, and Norman West] </F>   [Text] Frustrated premiers in the nine provinces are  demanding that the government urgently grant them the powers  needed to end the "paralysis" in their administrations.    From May 10, when President Nelson Mandela was inaugurated,  administration of provincial and homeland laws reverted to  central government.    Until the president gives these powers, and several other  functions the provinces are entitled to under the constitution,  they are unable to govern.    Every function, from filling vacancies in schools to buying  equipment, now requires the approval of the government.    "The whole system is as clear as mud at the moment. Premiers  and executive councils cannot take a decision with any binding  effect," one provincial official said this week.    "We want our powers. We are under enormous pressure to show  our constituencies that we are effective governments and can  deliver on the promises of the reconstruction and development  programme," Eastern Transvaal Premier Mathews Phosa said.    KwaZulu Natal Premier Frank Mdlalose said the delay was  causing serious problems.    "The civil service is continuing but the direction that  should be given by the ministers is hampered. Ministers are not  really ministers without the powers that should be given to  them," he said.    [Orange] Free State Premier Patrick "Terror" Lekota said it  was impacting on his government. "Some questions coming from  the ground -- I can't deal with them. People may want salary  adjustment, or promotions," he said.    The provinces had to apply within 14 days of the election of  their premiers for their powers and this was complied with.    However, at a meeting of the premiers with representatives  from government in Cape Town on Wednesday, they were told there  was a mass of red tape to unwind before they could receive any  powers.    There appear to be two problems. The first is that the  government has to decide which functions will be performed by  itself and which by the provinces. Existing legislation needs  to be deciphered and rationalised.    The second is that the provinces must have the structures to  administer these laws. Crucial to this is the establishment of  provincial treasury departments to control expenditure.    But there will first have to be a rationalisation of the  central government, provincial and homeland civil services.    Sources at the meeting said the premiers were united in  demanding their powers. They said that North West Premier Popo  Molefe was "living" while PWV premier Tokyo Sexwale was  frustrated.    They said Mr Sexwale told Public Service and Administration  Minister Zola Skweyiya: "I left my legislature in the belief  that I would receive the powers we need to show people that  there is government in place that can attend to the needs of the  communities. And here I am being told that more work needs to be  done and am being sent back empty-handed."    A special commission on provincial government to assist in  transferring powers was appointed on Friday.    Mr Phosa said he was governing in terms of the common law  until the power were transferred.    "I am acting on the principle that the president would have  behaved in the same way were he faced with the same problem," he  said.    Mr Lekota said that while his government was being hampered  by the lack of executive power, this was only a "passing phase".    He said a public service act, enabling the provinces to  appoint staff and set up administrations, would be passed soon.    However, KwaZulu Natal MEC [Member of Executive Council] for  Local Government and Housing, Mr Peter Miller, was less sanguine.    "The executive councils of all nine provinces have no power  on any issue which is scheduled by the constitution to be in  their competence. This is leading to a total paralysis in  government.    "There isn't a clear understanding in certain areas that  provinces are big government business and cannot be left in a  vacuum," he said.    Western Cape Housing Minister Gerald Morkel said it appeared  the transfer would be delayed until all the provinces had the  necessary infrastructure.    "We are unhappy about his ... we can't afford to be tied  down  because of the incapacity of other provinces to handle  functions," he said.    A provincial official said that the government would be  holding meetings with the provinces during the next two weeks.  A plenary session with the premiers will be held on June 9.</p>

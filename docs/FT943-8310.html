			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Japanese cool on car imports Nearly two-thirds of Japanese car dealers who do not distribute imported cars have no plans to do so, according to a survey by the Japanese Automobile Dealers' Association, writes Emiko Terazono from Tokyo. Of the 433 dealers surveyed, only 0.9 per cent said they were making arrangements to deal in imported cars and 28.2 per cent said they were considering doing so. A separate survey of JADA members revealed that dealers were nervous about the quality and availability of services and parts supplies for US cars as well as the availability of exclusive distribution contracts. Japanese dealers' reluctance to handle imported cars has been criticised by the US government and foreign car companies as an unseen trade barrier but the association said US manufacturers and suppliers should address the concerns raised in the survey.</p>

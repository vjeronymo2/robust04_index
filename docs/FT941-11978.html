			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: Benetton may diversify after move to raise L265bn Benetton, the Italian clothing group, may be gearing up for a big acquisition outside its traditional activities. Mr Aldo Palmeri, managing director, said the company had not entered negotiations. However, he indicated it was looking for substantial acquisitions to 'accelerate ourcapacity to develop'. The comment came against the announcement of a L265bn (Dollars 156m) cash-raising exercise to broaden the appeal of the group's shares. Benetton will sell 10m new shares, priced at L26,500 each, to international investors, notably in the US, in an attempt to broaden its shareholding base. 'Our shareholders are now concentrated in Europe, especially Italy,' said Mr Palmeri. 'We want to attract new investors from the US, the Far East and Europe.' The issue will also increase Benetton's float to about 30 per cent of the total capital from about 25 per cent at present. The remaining stock is controlled by the Benetton family. Mr Palmeri said the decision to increase the float was taken partly in response to big investors, who had called for a more liquid market in the group's stock. Some potential investors had been prevented from buying stock because of internal rules prohibiting share purchases in companies with a limited float. The additional cash raised, along with last year's strong internal cash flow, would leave Benetton poised to take advantage of takeover opportunities, said Mr Palmeri. 'We have nothing planned today, but we want to be able to negotiate from a strongposition,' he said. Possible purchases could include other well-known brands, or companies which could help to lift Benetton's sales in parts of the world where it is not yet fully developed. Analysts expect the group, which will report its 1993 results in March, to announce a sales increase of about 10 per cent to L2,512bn. Net profits are expected to increase by more than 10 per cent from the L184.7bn made in 1992.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Scha: "Progress in Biological Plant Protection; </F> Ciba-Geigy Brings Two New Biological Products to Market"]    [Text] Bielefeld--The use of biological plant protectants  is today still subject to many limitations. Their production is  mainly labor-intensive and costly, their storability often very  short, delivering them to the plants is also labor-intensive and  costly, their effectiveness often limited, and the user has to  be very knowledgable about them. Ciba-Geigy, which claims to be  the leading firm in the plant protection market, has now  introduced the first bioproducts ready for marketing in Germany  to control pests and diseases biologically in commercial  horticulture and tree nurseries which, according to Jakob  Brassel, the director of the Ciba department for research and  development on biological plant protection, signify a  breakthrough in this sector. Whereas up to now biological  control agents have accounted for only 1.5 percent of all  pesticides worldwide, this percentage is expected to grow to 5  percent by the year 2000. By then Ciba wants to have developed a  product line of biological pest and disease-control agents.    Based on live elvers (nematodes), the bioproducts "Exhibit  F27" and "Exhibit G25" that have now been introduced will be  used in the cultivation of ornamental plants to control the  larvae of small gnats [Lycoriidae] or of the dreaded  Dickmaulruessler [a type of insect pest]. In 1992 Ciba concluded  a worldwide developement and marketing agreement for  nematode-based products with the American firm Biosys in Palo  Alto, California, and it possesses the marketing rights for the  whole world, with the exception of Japan. The nematodes are  produced in the trillions in biofermenters, emptied into fabric  hoses pervious to air, and in the process embedded in a natural,  viscous biopolymer. The practical apportionment of 5 million  units allows for a dosage that matches production with demand,  even over smaller areas. The bioproducts are closely bound to  the insect larvae to produce specific effects and are therefore  absolutely compatible with plants and the environment.    In connection with this, Ciba-Geigy stresses the fact that  chemical plant protection will also be essential in future to  ensure profits, especially with big crops like, for example,  wheat, corn, rice, soybeans, and cotton. But in terms of  integrated plant protection, the combination of biological and  chemical agents is gaining in importance. Approaches involving  genetic engineering may also offer ways of solving the problem.</p>

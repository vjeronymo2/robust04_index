			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Nomura chief calls for more open markets Japan's equity markets must be made more open and competitive if the economy is to recover, Mr Hideo Sakamaki, president of Nomura, Japan's leading securities company, said at the weekend. He called on the finance ministry to scrap Japan's 0.3 per cent tax on securities sales and to admit more banks to the securities business. He also recommended the dismantling of the cross-shareholdings that bind together Japan's keiretsu, or corporate families. 'The fewer cross-shareholdings the better,' he said. 'The Tokyo market must become fully functional as the heart which pumps blood into the economy,' said Mr Sakamaki. Japan's equity markets were 'at the development stage' compared to the US and London, but needed to catch up fast to cope with Japan's transition from a mixed economy to a free market economy, he argued. 'The Japanese system is distorted and strained, both in politics and the economy,' said Mr Sakamaki. Japan's securities industry has been calling for an end to securities sales tax for years. Demands have intensified recently because of a doubling in the past year in the value of Japanese shares traded in London, where there is no such tax. The finance ministry is unwilling to abolish this source of government revenue, on the grounds that Japanese share trades are already lightly taxed. Individual investors, for example, pay no capital gains levy. Nomura's call for a more open equity market reflects its own confidence in being able to face increased competition, after a partial recovery from its dive in profits in the early 1990s. Smaller brokers do not share this confidence because of their over-reliance on commission income at a time when the share turnover is low. The economy was still 'in a tunnel' with no sign of the exit, said Mr Sakamaki, pessimistic by contrast with the comments on Friday by the government's Economic Planning Agency that bright signs were gradually spreading. Pre-tax profits of Japan's top 400 companies last year were barely above the level of a decade ago and their return on equity was poor, 2.7 per cent, by comparison with their US counterparts' 13 per cent, Mr Sakamaki pointed out. High wage costs were a big factor in this. Japanese costs were so high that not even a Y100,000bn (Pounds 653bn) increase over their Y191,000bn sales last year would bring an increase in profits, he predicted.</p>

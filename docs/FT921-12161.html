			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Observer: If at first . . . When two Canadian hunters returned to their hired seaplane dragging a huge moose, the pilot first refused to risk taking off with so heavy a load. The pair shamed him into it by saying a rival pilot hadn't feared to carry as big an animal shot nearby a year earlier. The plane failed to rise, however, crashing into the lakeside, luckily with no serious injuries, although stunning one of the hunters who woke up asking: 'Where are we?' 'Back where we were a year ago,' said his partner.</p>

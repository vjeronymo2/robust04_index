			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Big guns open fire on rogue candidate - Winchester: The war of words in Wessex IT WAS the Tory party equivalent of sending a gunboat down the Itchen. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday waded into the fray over the two Conservative candidates for Winchester by calling for the withdrawal of Mr John Browne, the renegade MP who is standing for re-election to the Wessex capital. Touring the damp city pedestrian precinct yesterday, Mr Hurd said Mr Browne's candidature was causing 'complications' and advised him to stand down. It was the same reasonable tone with which Mr Hurd has dealt in the past with Saddam Hussein. Mr Hurd was brought in to support the official Conservative candidate, Mr Gerald Malone, a 40-year old Glaswegian solicitor. The former Tory MP for Aberdeen South was selected as the official candidate after Mr Browne, in trouble for failing to disclose business interests, was disowned by the party, both locally and nationally. The imbroglio has increased the Liberal Democrats' hopes of winning the seat. Their candidate - Mr Tony Barron, an energetic 50-year old quantity surveyor - yesterday predicted he would clinch a wafer-thin majority. 'I don't care if they put up 20 Tory candidates, I'll still win,' he quipped. With Winchester showing one of the largest unemployment rises in Hampshire during the past two years, Mr Barron said the 'feel-lousy factor' was aiding his cause. Speaking in the Conservative Association offices above an estate agent, Mr Malone said he was confident of a 10,000-11,000 majority. In 1987, Mr Browne  -the MP since 1979  - won with a reduced 7,400 margin ahead of the Social Democrats. Mr Malone is benefiting from Central Office heavy artillery to show Tory voters that he, and not Mr Browne, is the one to back. Mr Tom King, the defence secretary, comes to Winchester today. Of Mr Browne, Mr Malone said: 'He is trying to convince people that he is the real brand of Omo, and I'm the biological version.' He predicted his rival would reap a 'derisory' vote. 'The people in this election will be voting very seriously . . . They will not be distracted by the diversion of an independent,' Mr Malone said. Mr Browne has other ideas. Ensconced in the Winchester Conservative Club, the nondescript building smelling of fried food which is his campaign headquarters, Mr Browne forecast he would lose only about 20 per cent of the 32,000 votes he won in 1987. Assisted by his American wife, who calls their campaign van the 'Jomobile', Mr Browne says he is representing constituents' best interests by refusing to bow to the local party's wish to unseat him. 'I have been fixed as a scapegoat. They have now leapt on my back as a troublesome person.' He accused the Tories of using methods to discredit him which would make the KGB blush. Watching Mr Hurd perform outside the local shops yesterday, Mrs Felicity Hindson, chairman of the local Conservative Association, sighed: 'A lot of people have been very annoyed about this.' The Conservatives will be even more annoyed if this true-blue bastion totters.</p>

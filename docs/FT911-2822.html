			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Travel: Where souls go astray - The hill-tribes of north-west Thailand A map of the hill-tribes of south-east Asia looks a bit like the markings on an exotic butterfly. Even the simplest code needs seven different colours to differentiate between the major ethnic groups. The tribes-people themselves view tourists with curiosity but not hostility. This is not always true of their governments. Most independent travellers in Laos, Burma, Vietnam and China are assumed to be spreading revolution and dissent unless they can prove otherwise. North-west Thailand is the one place where it is possible to visit the hill-tribes, whether alone or in a group. THERE WAS no question about it. The felled teak log at the end of an exhausting uphill forest path had my name on it. I sat down on it and looked through the thin, dry forest at the path ahead. It snaked around a steep shoulder, but seemed at last to have finished the long, steady ascent. Suddenly, bouncing cheerfully up the hill, came a young Lahu man. He was wearing a broad smile and a stylish billowing black shirt, and was carrying a bird gun with a long, thin barrel. He sat down, not for a rest but for a cheerful conversation that in the absence of a common language soon fell into a companionable silence. Toiling up the hill in his wake were three women, using headbands to carry heavy baskets. They unslung their loads and sat on the ground, politely agreeing that it was no mean slope but showing no signs of weariness. Their black jackets hung fastened in the customary way, with a single button under the chin leaving the breasts largely exposed: a style designed to facilitate breast-feeding. I let the locals go ahead, somewhat stunned by this sudden rush of activity, for I was deep in the hills near the Burmese border in the north-west of Thailand and hadn't expected so many people. Finally, I came to the village. Teak-framed houses stood in small gardens fenced off with split-bamboo screens. Pigs, chickens and children played in the yards and stopped and stared at what I thought was a white face. In fact it was red. The curious came out on to the path and stared after me, touching each other and giggling. Although I was travelling in a group of eight, we had split into straggling ones and twos by the time we arrived at the village. We were introduced to the headman by our guide and shown the floor that was to be our bed. Typically, the house we were staying in was built on stilts and was made around a teak frame and floored with sheets of bamboo. Widely-spaced steps gave pig-proof access to a wide veranda with views over the village and to the mountains beyond. As they returned from the fields, all the villagers stopped to look us over; later, many returned for another look. With no television or radio, we were entertainment. A meal was cooked for us by our guide, who chatted to the locals and made us feel less like intruders. Whatever the cultural achievements of the hill-tribes, cooking is not one of them. Meat only creeps on to the menu as part of a religious ceremony: the smell of the cooking is sacrificed to the gods and the tribes-people eat the rest. Some of the religious beliefs of the hill-tribes seem rather less sensible and are often inextricably tied up with health care. Although prayer may seem a reasonable cure for some ailments - stress or depression, for instance - it cannot be expected to cure everything. But the local witchdoctors do know of some ailments as yet unknown to western medical science. An example of this is soul loss. Workers in the fields suddenly notice a sudden lassitude and a desire to lie down. Apparently this is not just a reaction to the back-breaking lifestyle that limits their life expectancy to the late 40s, but means that their souls have gone astray. Luckily, any hill-tribe shaman (witchdoctor) has a personal method of tempting souls back. In a complicated ceremony involving candles, split logs and a lot of string, the Lahu tribes draw souls back from their holiday to be secured in the body by small cloth wristlets. If they are worried by their own spirits getting lost, they are even more concerned about bad spirits getting into their villages. Apart from the resident spirit living in what is usually the only cupboard in any hill-tribe house, ghouls and ghosts are not welcome. Woven bamboo circles are made as guards and each year exorcisms are held in every house. The religious convictions vary depending according to the specific tribe, but this is the least of their differences. Villages in adjacent valleys often speak different languages, wear different clothes and have different customs. There are seven main ethnic groups, which can be divided endlessly by anthropologists. These cultural differences were built up in southern China. All the hill-tribes are traditionally nomadic, moving every three to 15 years to exploit new pastures. Over the last 200 years word spread through China of vast, untouched forest in the countries of south-east Asia, and gradually the influx started. The easy-going Thais accepted their new neighbours on a live-and-let-live basis but now, with growing population pressures, problems are appearing. Timber is a central issue. Thailand would either like to profit from its timber, or conserve it. The hill-tribes are not likely to co-operate with either of these aims. Partly this is because their religion tells them that land is communal, but they also have their own plans for trees, which might involve using them for housing or just burning them to clear the way for fields. As a result, calculated attempts at integration are starting. Thai teachers now run the first local schools and it is this, rather than tourism, that is starting to change the hill-tribes. In any case, the interaction between tribesmen and tourists rarely exceeds the occasional commercial transaction. For a start, the hill-tribes are often shy. The world of large, hairy creatures with watches, cameras and synthetic clothing is very foreign in rural north-west Thailand. The hill-tribe villagers are not so unworldly as to think that their visitors actually come from another planet. Of course they don't. Everyone knows that the points of light in the sky are too far away. And too small. After much discussion, many of them have decided that we come from the moon. Hill-tribe villages on major roads are usually well accustomed to visitors. To see how they lived their lives originally, it is necessary to get off the beaten track, whether on foot, elephant or possibly a small rented motorcycle. There are good tours available which can be booked through established agencies in Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai and Mae Hong Song. As the commercially-orientated Thais leap on to the tourism bandwagon, more and more operators are starting up in the smaller towns and villages with each season. I saw the hill-tribes through Top Deck Travel, which has persuaded an Australian expat, John Spies, to run reasonably energetic trekking tours. As he happens to be one of the top anthropologists in the field, and knows the land like the back of his hand, these tours are highly recommended. Most of the other guides are Thai - perfectly satisfactory if their English is good, though often it is not. It is possible, but not easy, to travel on your own in this region, but there is a danger of missing the significance of any ceremony or action. Women, however, should not travel alone. Top Deck Travel's 14-day north Thailand trek costs from Pounds 460 (excluding flights), and can be booked through the Adventure Travel Centre in London, tel: 370-4555.</p>

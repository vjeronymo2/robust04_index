			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 14 April Evening Edition] </F>   [Text] Answering correspondents' questions at the Diet  building on 14 April, Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] stated: "The moment of decision  is fast approaching." He indicated that if Chief Cabinet  Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, head of Sakigake [Harbinger],  insists on deciding on the new prime minister at a meeting of  leaders of the coalition parties, he would ask the coalition  representatives meeting to enter substantial discussions on the  succession issue without Sakigake.    At the end of the representatives meeting on the morning of  14 April, Ozawa expressed displeasure at the conflict in the  ruling coalition parties over the venue of discussions to select  the new prime minister. He stated: "There has been no progress  at all. We cannot afford to be dilly-dallying forever."  Concerning the suggestion that the issue be taken up at a joint  meeting of party leaders and representatives, Ozawa explained:  "I am not the one opposed to this. Takemura is the problem."  He criticized Takemura in strong terms, saying "(he) says we  have to start everything from scratch, including the coalition."    With regard to the Social Democratic Party of Japan and the  Democratic Socialist Party, Ozawa wanted them to take an  explicit position on whether they want to undertake discussions  at the party leaders' meeting or at the representatives'  meeting. He said: "They should talk within their own parties  whether they want to do things the Sakigake way."</p>

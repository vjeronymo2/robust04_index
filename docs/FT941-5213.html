			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Can Europe Competer: Tensions on health care and pensions - Welfare State The greatest impact of the ageing of Europe will be felt on the welfare state, the cost of which is already putting pressure on the public finances and international competitiveness of much of western Europe. The OECD estimates the pension burden could double over the next 50 years, through a combination of an ageing population and the increasing coverage of pension schemes. Over the same period, the number of western Europeans of working age will drop by more than 15 per cent, leaving fewer people to generate the wealth to pay for pensions. The tensions will be most acute in Germany, where there will be barely more than two people of working age for each person over 65 by 2040. Under current arrangements, social costs would climb from 33 per cent of GDP to more than 50 per cent, says Mr Heino Fassbender of the Frankfurt office of McKinsey, the management consultants. Mr Fassbender predicts such increases will strain the inter-generational contract under which those in work pay taxes to finance the welfare state for those who have retired. 'We are heading towards the point when it will be impossible for our pay-as-you-go system to finance pensions and health care for the elderly,' he says. The social security contributions paid by German employers and employees have already risen steeply to almost 40 per cent of the wage bill. Resultant higher employment costs are now widely seen as a factor in the country's declining competitiveness. Some steps have been taken to curb increases, including limiting the rate at which pensions rise and raising the retirement age. Pensions are already 20 per cent lower than they otherwise would have been, says Professor Jens Alber of Konstanz university. But there is little chance of winning support for more radical measures, says Prof Alber: 'The present system is endorsed by 80 to 90 per cent of people in opinion polls, even if it involves much higher contribution rates.' And the government has recently agreed to a potentially costly extension of the welfare state with the introduction of a scheme for care of the elderly. Until now, this has been the responsibility of families. 'While people know about the demographic trends, they don't yet appreciate the costs,' says Ms Stephanie Wahl of the Bonn-based Institut fur Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft. 'The government is reluctant to enlighten them, because it would raise fears in the electorate in the run-up to October's general election.' The Institut advocates a switch away from the current earnings-related pension scheme. Instead it recommends greater private savings for retirement, with a flat-rate pension as a safety net for those unable to support themselves. This solution is backed by Mr Fassbender: 'Sooner or later, people will realise the need to increase the amount they set aside to live on in retirement,' he says. Similar pressures will be felt across much of Europe as the population ages. Most countries are pruning their welfare states in ways that will encourage greater private provision. Countries such as the UK and the US which have already encouraged private pension provision will find it easier to promote a continuing switch away from public provision. And countries like the US and Australia, which are more open to immigration, face less serious demographic problems as younger migrants arrive and start families. Until the current recession, immigration has reduced the rate of Germany's population decline, bringing over 3m new inhabitants in the last three years. 'There would be resistance to the arrival of more immigrants with current levels of unemployment,' says Prof Alber. 'But as the economy recovers and there is again a shortage of labour, further immigration might be acceptable.' But countries imposing the lowest welfare costs on businesses stand to gain most from a decline in Europe's competitiveness as the population ages. These will include the rapidly industrialising countries of Latin America and Asia with their young and growing workforces. But it could also include the more mature economies of east Asia, which are emphasising the responsibility of families in caring for older relatives.</p>

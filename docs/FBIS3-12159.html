The government is sending its  condolences to the families of the dead and is wishing speedy  recovery to the wounded. The government has decided to  compensate the families of the victims. The government is  calling on all residents, both Arabs and Jews, to exercise  maximum restraint despite the grave circumstances. The IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] and all the security forces are adopting  all necessary measures to prevent incitement, violence, and a  deterioration of the situation. During the meeting, the cabinet  ministers and the attorney general raised proposals for various  possible measures of handling radical Israeli elements that are  instigative elements in the territories. The government believes  that these elements gravely and dangerously violate public  order, and that every legal measure should be adopted to curb  and restrain them. Even concerning an act by a single  individual -- as was the case in Hebron this morning -- we  cannot ignore the influence of instigative remarks made publicly  that threaten the citizen's well-being.    The government has entrusted the prime minister and defense  minister with the task of examining all measures proposed during  today's discussion and of informing the cabinet of his decisions  on 27 February. The investigation of today's incidents will be  complete. The government is resolved to continue its peace  efforts and to promote the negotiations to the best of its  ability.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Simferopol--At a session on 13 June, the presidium  of the Crimean Supreme Council examined the activity of the  Council's working group at the talks between the parliamentary  delegations of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea. Serhiy  Nikulin, chairman of the commission on state-building, legality,  and law and order, noted that they had reached a new level of  mutual relations as a result of the third round of talks.    "The Ukrainian Supreme Council's full understanding of what  is occurring has been observed. Ukraine has agreed to the  proposal to set up an informational and legal base and admits  the possibility of developing relations on a constitutional and  a treaty basis," Nikulin stressed. A new group was set up for  talks, and its powers were stipulated.    The issue of the activity of Ukraine's Internal Affairs  Ministry in reorganizing Crimea's Internal Affairs Ministry into  the main internal affairs directorate of Crimea was also  discussed. The presidium's resolution notes that "the  reorganization of Crimea's Internal Affairs Ministry does not  facilitate the stabilization of the situation on the peninsula"  and that mutual relations between Ukraine's Internal Affairs  Ministry and the Republic of Crimea's Internal Affairs Ministry  have become somewhat more complicated.    Financing is being carried out in accordance with a new  system. Funds for maintaining the militia come from the main  internal affairs directorate of Crimea under Ukraine's Internal  Affairs Ministry, and not from Crimea's Internal Affairs  Ministry. It was decided to inform Ukraine's Supreme Council of  the impermissibility of the actions of Ukraine's Internal  Affairs Ministry, and also to examine the issue of the Crimean  government allocating funds for maintaining the Republic's  militia.    In connection with this, Mykhaylo Bakharyev, a member of the  presidium, noted that "hooligans with general's shoulder boards  spit at their own Ukrainian laws. Therefore, we should state  this in the form of an ultimatum and not hold talks until they  fulfill our demands."    It was proposed that the old excise duties that Yuriy  Meshkov  had introduced be restored, in order to make it possible to  remove tension from the budget, to find funds to repay the debt  to Ukraine, which amounts to 761.8 billion karbovantsi, and to  finance the Republic of Crimea's Internal Affairs Ministry.</p>

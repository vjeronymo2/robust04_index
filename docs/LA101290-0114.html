			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> GETTING THE MESSAGE BY COMPUTER;  </P> <P> NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND NETWORKS ARE HELPING MORE PEOPLE TO COMMUNICATE BY  ELECTRONIC MAIL. SPEED, DIRECTNESS AND A SENSE OF ANONYMITY ARE ATTRACTING HOME  USERS.  </P> <P> As Alice McLerran's father lay dying in a Rancho Bernardo retirement home, she  was at his bedside -- with her laptop computer.  </P> <P> McLerran tapped out a stream of messages on her keyboard, sending updates on  her father's condition to everyone from a sister in Lexington, Mass., to a son  in Seattle to a cousin in Dublin, Ohio. Her scattered family shot back words of  support.  </P> <P> "I knew that by having the laptop, I could keep everyone close by," said  McLerran, a children's book author from Minneapolis.  </P> <P> When Americans reach out and touch friends and loved ones, increasingly they  are doing it by personal computer. Already widely used in the workplace and in  scientific circles, electronic mail and computerized bulletin board networks  finally are making inroads into the home and drawing a devoted following.  </P> <P> Urban sprawl, the pressure on two-income families to get more done in less time  and the need many people have for more human contact are creating demand for  computer communications, proponents say. Shut-ins and lovers have met via their  PCs.  </P> <P> Many people find the speed, directness and sense of anonymity of computer  messaging liberating, and some of the biggest fans of the technology hope it  will inspire a rebirth in the art of correspondence. Social conventions,  however, still are being established. Network users sometimes let loose when  they dash off a message.  </P> <P> "You can get the same kind of problems you do with any other social  interaction," said Jack M. Nilles, a Brentwood management consultant who  specializes in technology issues. "People can be rude, obnoxious and foul."  </P> <P> The computer networks also offer a way to transmit annoying junk messages and,  occasionally, pornography in the form of "digital dirty pictures" to a computer  user's screen. Authorities say criminals have been known to tap obscure  computer networks to negotiate drug deals, plot child molestation schemes and  distribute stolen credit card numbers and other confidential data.  </P> <P> Before becoming a truly mass medium, computer communications will have to win  over far more of the PC-wary American public. By one estimate, 1.7 million U.S.  households subscribe to public networks with bulletin boards and electronic  mail, or e-mail. That's more than double the 1987 total, but the number of  people who actually send messages from their home PCs every week still is  believed to be only in the hundreds of thousands.  </P> <P> People talk with one another by PC in three basic ways:  </P> <P> With e-mail, they can send a private written message directly to one person or  to a defined group. Those who receive the note can read it at their  convenience.  </P> <P> A related activity, typically known as chatting or conferencing, involves  groups of computer users holding "conversations" by sending messages among  themselves simultaneously.  </P> <P> Bulletin boards, on the other hand, are forums where comments and questions are  posted that anyone else scrolling through the board later can answer -- either  by posting a reply on the board or by firing an e-mail message back to the  original sender.  </P> <P> High-tech hobbyists and others who work on computers at their offices were the  first to embrace the technology for the home. With systems becoming easier to  use, novices such as McLerran, a self-described "computer illiterate," are  starting to join them.  </P> <P> The handicapped, the elderly, AIDS patients and others with special concerns  who crave companionship or a public forum rave about computer messaging. Carol  Cunningham, a wheelchair-bound private tutor in Irving, Tex., got her first  home computer as a Christmas gift last year, signed up for a network in  February and quickly became an enthusiast.  </P> <P> "We can't always just get out and jump into a car and meet somebody. Yet we can  sign onto a computer, and get onto e-mail," she said. Cunningham, 48, is in a  pair of informal computer groups for the disabled that swap information on such  things as new shower chairs and hotels with good wheelchair access.  </P> <P> Computer messaging is helping many other ordinary Americans. Traveling  salespeople sometimes check on their children back home by computer instead of  by telephone. After last year's big earthquake, PC owners in the Bay Area used  e-mail to let their loved ones across the country know that they were OK, using  leased transmissions lines spared by the temblor.  </P> <P> Santa Monica residents correspond with city officials via computer about street  crime and the homeless on a municipal computer network launched last year.  </P> <P> The computer networks, largely through their bulletin boards on special topics,  also are creating "virtual communities" of people interested in such diverse  areas as Eastern European politics, model airplanes and science fiction. After  last year's Tian An Men Square massacre, Chinese students around the world  looked to bulletin boards to organize protests and compile lists of the dead  and missing.  </P> <P> "You see groups of people getting together who never would have before," Nilles  said. Late last year, an Arizona man who had searched for his two sons for 29  years located them by spotting one of their names on the CompuServe network.  </P> <P> E-mail devotees say a big part of the appeal is that people let their hair down  when they converse electronically.  </P> <P> McLerran cites the case of her "computer niece," a close friend she made via  computer. In normal social settings, the friend is "painfully, painfully shy."  On the computer, McLerran says, "She's a social butterfly."  </P> <P> Loosened inhibitions, however, can lead to trouble. "People who have a lot of  pent-up hostility find this is a way to lash out," said McLerran, citing the  overheated computer exchanges known in some circles as "flaming."  </P> <P> She said she belonged to an e-mail writers group whose computer conferences  deteriorated at one point into name-calling and vulgarity. She quit the group  after discovering that she "really, really hurt" the feelings of another writer  whose work she critiqued.  </P> <P> McLerran said she realized that "if I can't see their faces and see how they  react (to criticism), I might be doing something I shouldn't fool with."  </P> <P> Still, enthusiasts say computer linkups are a great way to make friends.  Dorothy Fulk, a day care center operator from Apalachin, N.Y., said she started  using a computer "chat" line on the Genie network to cope with her loneliness  after divorce. Fulk said she likes the way computer communications breaks down  social barriers.  </P> <P> "You really communicate with the person," she said. "You don't get distracted  by how old they are, how fat they are, or whether they're black or white."  </P> <P> It also can lead to romance. Fulk met her current husband, Steven, after  chatting with him for nearly a year by computer. One of their first exchanges  came after Dorothy, then a graduate student, posted an electronic note seeking  volunteers to take a coffee marketing survey. Before long, they made a "date"  to participate in a computer round-table discussion on space exploration, a  mutual interest.  </P> <P> They eventually arranged a face-to-face meeting, and the relationship bloomed.  Last month Dorothy gave birth to their first child, a girl, and the Fulks put  out their birth announcement over the computer.  </P> <P> It doesn't always work out that well. The clumsy singles bar pickup line, "Come  here often?" has an e-mail equivalent, "I like the way you type." Also, some  users complain about unsolicited electronic advances, including come-ons from  men who portray themselves as women, or vice versa.  </P> <P> The rise of computer messaging seems to have caught some experts by surprise.  Many of the newcomers to computer communications were brought into the fold by  Prodigy, a fast-growing electronic information service owned by International  Business Machines and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.  </P> <P> Prodigy was unveiled two years ago as an easy-to-use system for casual computer  users largely for computerized shopping, banking and investing. But its  less-emphasized e-mail service has proven to be unexpectedly popular,  particularly among a hard-core group that the company says amounts to about 5%  of its subscribers.  </P> <P> When Prodigy announced plans in September to impose new charges next year on  its heaviest users of e-mail, angry subscribers fired off thousands of  complaints and started boycotting retailers that advertise on the system.  "Those who like it, like it a lot, and are very vocal about it," said Gary  Arlen, an information services consultant in Bethesda, Md.  </P> <P> Prodigy said it is adding the e-mail charge to cover its costs. On top of a  monthly fee of up to $12.95, Prodigy subscribers eventually will be charged 25  cents a message if they exceed their limit of 30 free messages a month, under  the current plan.  </P> <P> CompuServe, at 10 years old the longest-running and biggest of the networks for  home computer users, charges most users 21 cents a minute, on top of a monthly  fee of $1.50.  </P> <P> In many cases e-mail is cheaper than a long-distance phone call, and that cost  advantage may be inherent because e-mail generally takes up less transmission  time than voice communications.  </P> <P> Over the short term, the chances of a continued boom in communications via home  computer is generally thought to be bright. Arlen estimates that computer  networks have signed up little more than one-quarter of the roughly 6.25  million U.S. households that have PCs and modems, the telecommunications  devices that let computers talk over the phone. Meanwhile, more people are  buying PCs and modems for their homes, even if the trend is much slower than  futurists once expected.  </P> <P> Experts differ, however, on how far home linkups will go over the long run.  Prodigy has lost hundreds of millions of dollars, and it is not clear whether  its competitors are making enough money to stay in the business indefinitely  either.  </P> <P> Many of the big companies that operate computer networks -- including  long-distance telephone giants American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, US Sprint  and MCI Communications -- are aiming more at business customers than  residential users. MCI touted its MCI Mail service in 1983 as "the nation's  next post office," only to see it take off slowly.  </P> <P> France's Minitel network, using millions of simple terminals distributed at no  charge by a government utility, is considered the most successful electronic  information system overseas. But Robert W. Lucky, research chief at AT&amp;T's  Bell Laboratories, noted that it has relied on subsidies and other types of  public support that networks are unlikely to get in this country.  </P> <P> Minitel's popularity is limited. Among the few big money-makers are its  notorious "pink" erotic messages services, which critics say are used by  prostitutes and child molesters to make contacts.  </P> <P> Moreover, many Americans are uneasy about working on computers. "Half the  people in this country don't know how to program their VCRs," Lucky said.  "People won't take to this naturally."  </P> <P> Even as computers become easier to use, some experts say, the telephone will  remain a formidable competitor, particularly as new telephone information  services are introduced.  </P> <P> And although an adequate PC and modem now can be bought for well under $1,000,  the cost still scares off many consumers.  </P> <P> On top of that, the technology is plagued with unresolved logistic, legal and  ethical concerns. Once too many people start using a bulletin board, it tends  to get cluttered with junk messages, Lucky said. The issue has fueled debates  pitting computer users who support open access to bulletin boards against  others who want some editing so they don't have to waste time wading through  irrelevant messages.  </P> <P> Still, enthusiasts predict that the problems will be worked out over time and  that the coming years will bring an explosion in computer messaging. They are  encouraged by recent negotiations between computer networks to arrange hookups  enabling subscribers on different systems to communicate with each other. The  lack of hookups between computer networks, experts say, has held back computer  messaging much the same way the lack of a unified telephone network hampered  the use of the telephone around the turn of the century.  </P> <P> But the biggest thing computer messaging may have going for it is the human  need to communicate, a need that the technology fulfills for many people. "When  I touch my keyboard," Lucky said, "I really feel as though I'm in touch with  the world."  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMPUTER NETWORKS  </P> <P> The consumer networks are designed primarily for owners of home computers.  </P> <P> Households subscribing:  </P> <P> CompuServe: 625,000  </P> <P> Prodigy: 308,000  </P> <P> Genie: 222,000  </P> <P> Quantum*: 145,000  </P> <P> Delphi: 80,000  </P> <P> * Includes the America Online, PC-Link and Q-Link services  </P></p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Technology: From chalk to superhighways / A look at private UK initiatives to bring software and curriculum packages into the classroom Not much has changed in the typical British secondary school classroom since the death of Queen Victoria. Whiteboards may have replaced blackboards, but the notion of a personal computer on every desk is still largely the stuff of science fiction. At best, there will be a room of PCs for lessons in computing and possibly information technology - very likely funded by a government initiative. At worst, a school will boast a handful of outdated machines. If education is supposed to be a preparation for future life, this state of affairs beggars belief. Ever fewer of tomorrow's jobs will be manual or in the primary industries; ever more will be in careers - professional, clerical, sales, administration - where computer literacy is essential. Nor are the benefits of a PC-based education to be measured in PC skills alone. As material and courses become available via CD-Rom and networks, chalk and textbooks should join the ink well and dunce's cap in the museum of childhood. Explaining the current malaise is easy enough. Money is scarce. Old habits die hard. Teachers lack requisite training. Hardware, software and course materials are expensive, and knowledge about what to buy is scarce. There is also a serious market failure. In most countries the computing and software industries have little incentive to develop products for cash-starved public education systems ignorant of the benefits. In Britain, private schools are not much better than their state counterparts. While university entrance continues to be determined by success at conventional A-levels, private schools' market niche is secure without innovation - and they can carry on investing instead in sports halls, music centres and private theatres, as they did in the 1980s. The key to change lies in political and professional will and the development of economic solutions. Tellingly, the places moving fastest in PC-based education, notably Singapore and some US states, are doing so under strong political leadership. But change can be led by the private sector if it has the right products at the right price and markets them effectively. In the UK, just such an exercise is about to start in earnest. Numerous initiatives are under way, but two stand out because they tackle the most immediate obstacles to change - the shortage of expertise and cash in the schools themselves. Alan Benjamin, a former director of corporate communications at ICL, is masterminding a British version of the 'community learning utility' now to be found in California and a dozen other US states. The key to the utility is simple: schools - or learners - pay for material on a usage basis, with software and curriculum packages selected and supplied by a community-based utility through a not-for-profit foundation. The scheme was unveiled at a recent seminar at London's South Bank Technopark with a demonstration of a software system in use in California, developed by Vistar Technologies, a US company. The Vistar system fits course material - whether procured from CD-Rom or a network - into an innovative Windows-based software teaching system, with an integrated messaging facility, student 'prescription' and 'writing' units, and lesson-planning programmes for teachers. The networked system is geared to classroom management and school administration as well as teaching. It includes attendance reporting, assessment and 'cards' for pupil achievement and course enrolments. The 'community learning utility' will make software and course materials available to learners from its own data repository and via its own network, charging for them on a usage basis. The utility will negotiate licences with software suppliers, 'sift' available course material, and commission teachers and others to provide more - which, if used, will earn them royalty income. The utility will also negotiate special rates with British Telecommunications and other telecoms operators to carry the networked material. Its success will be an important commentary on the seriousness of the operators in developing 'superhighway' services - both in their readiness to install fibre links to schools as needed, and in their capacity to make networked services affordable. Benjamin's first utility is likely to cover five schools and two further education colleges in inner south London, where the local South Thames Training and Enterprise Council - a not-for-profit company contracting with the government to provide training - has agreed to provide part of the funding to install hardware and software. He also hopes to gain support from telecoms companies and local businesses, which could purchase training on a pay-by-use basis. 'This is a new form of public utility,' says Benjamin. 'Its potential lies in the fact that digital information and software can be treated like water and electricity, and made available on a low-cost usage basis, breaking the capital barrier for millions of users.' If the south London utility is successful, others will be established. Benjamin envisages the utilities as public-private partnerships - perhaps between Tecs and leading technology or service companies - run as local businesses at a profit. The critical goal is for them to become self-financing, making the supply of software and materials sustainable. The second pioneering initiative also comes from the private sector, in the shape of CRT group, a Wirral-based training and recruitment company established four years ago and now claiming to be among the country's largest private training providers. Its chief executive, Karl Chapman, heads a team dedicated to taking technology into schools as a commercial proposition. With the aid of partners in the IT sector, Chapman plans later this year to equip a significant number of schools with a room of current-range PCs. CRT will provide software, hardware and, where appropriate, personnel. At the pilot stage, the schools will have only to provide the premises and pay for the software on the basis of usage and output results. In its initial guise, the scheme is both more and less ambitious than Benjamin's, although the two may come together in south London. It is more ambitious because of the number of schools likely to be included in the pilot; but less so because Chapman envisages networking and integrated teaching/administration software as a later stage in the process. He is gearing his early efforts to courses - particularly the new national general vocational qualifications in information technology - which are especially well-suited to interactive PC formats. Most of the pilot schools chosen by Chapman will be grant-maintained, because their head teachers and governors are - he judges - readier to innovate and less constrained by inherited attitudes and budgetary limitations. If the scheme fails, Chapman says he will simply leave the PCs in the schools. If it succeeds, he is working on financing packages making it possible for schools to secure more hardware without a large up-front capital cost. As for software, CRT believes it can meet its early demands for IT courses through its own multimedia subsidiary - formerly Convergence Communications - which is developing a range of multimedia training packages. The fate of the two initiatives will be a commentary on the receptiveness of schools to PC-based teaching methods. It will also demonstrate the ability of new technology and the devolution of school budgets to foster public-private partnerships in a field where the private sector has a substantial contribution to make. If information superhighways are to amount to anything by 2000, they will have to start laying tracks through the education system - not just universities - early on.</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (6): Years of painful negotiation - The steel industry When European Union industry ministers agreed last December on a package of aid and capacity cuts for Europe's subsidised steel companies it looked like years of painful negotiation, in which the Italian authorities had played a leading role, had come to an end. In Brussels, Italy - and in particular the heavily subsidised state-owned producer, Ilva - had been painted as the villain of the piece, accused of prevarication, stubborn refusal to reduce capacity and, at one point, of having deliberately concealed a blast furnace from European Commission inspectors. Rival producers warned they would be unable to subscribe to the EU plan to reduce capacity and rescue the whole European industry from a slump in demand, if the Italians did not fall into line. But Mr Paolo Savona, then Italy's industry minister, managed to win what looked at the time like a surprisingly good deal from his European counterparts. This envisaged a reduction of 2m tonnes in overall steel production in Italy. Under the original calculations, some 1.2m tonnes of capacity would be lost at Ilva's Taranto plant in southern Italy; 500,000 tonnes at plants owned by the eventual buyer of the Taranto flat products division; and a further 300,000 was accounted for by the dismantling of Ilva's Bagnoli plant, a hot rolled steel mill which was already lying dormant. Strict Commission surveillance was supposed to ensure that the terms of the package were observed. The Commission was particularly pleased with Rome's commitment to privatise Ilva by the end of 1994, meaning that the Ecu2.6bn subsidy allowed under the December agreement would be the last state aid for Ilva. Mr Savona estimated that the break-up and sale of Ilva could raise some L4,100bn for the state. Part of the privatisation process has already been completed, most notably with the sale of the more attractive special steels division of Ilva - Acciai Speciali Terni (AST) - at the end of June, bought by a German-Italian consortium for L600bn. But with the December deadline fast approaching the most important part of the Ilva privatisation - the sale of the flat products division, Ilva Laminati Piani (ILP), centred on Taranto - has yet to be carried out. Mr Vito Gnutti, who has been industry minister since Mr Silvio Berlusconi's government took office in May, is still confident that a sale will be made, but he admits that the pressure is increasing. 'It's clear that if there is only one buyer, and he knows we have to sell before December 31, this buyer will hold on until December hoping to put pressure on the seller,' he says. Other observers are even more pessimistic about the prospects for ILP. Mr Hayao Nakamura is the former representative of Nippon Steel in Italy, who took over as chief executive of Ilva in February last year. He inherited an extraordinary range of problems - debt was at the same level as turnover, for example, with interest rates at 13.5 per cent - and believes that the Italian state-owned steel industry was badly treated by Brussels. 'We're closing the Bagnoli hot steel mill - the latest hot steel mill constructed in Europe. From the point of view of rationalisation in Europe we should be closing the older ones, but Italy is closing the newest, which was built at a cost of L1,000bn,' points out Mr Nakamura, now an adviser to what remains of Ilva. He adds that Italy is having to import more than 50 per cent of its flat products from Germany and France, two of the countries which pressed hard for Italy to close down capacity. Mr Nakamura is also sceptical about the feasibility of offers made so far for the ILP division. G William Miller, the US merchant bank, is supposed to be linking up with a consortium of steelmakers and local enterprises in one offer, while Lucchini, the private Italian steel producer, is also said to be interested. Recent reports suggest that Riva, another private producer which was also part of the victorious consortium to buy AST, has come under pressure to join the bidding. But Mr Nakamura believes there is a risk that these offers will be too low, or based on the future sale of attractive parts of the business, and closure of the rest - an option which would lead to further job losses in some of Italy's most depressed regions. Mr Gnutti says, however, that strict conditions will be imposed on any buyers, preventing them from simply stripping the best ILP assets. Further job losses in the industry would only add to the suffering of the past few years of restructuring. In 1987, for example, Finsider, the state steelmaker which was Ilva's predecessor, produced a job reduction plan which would cut the workforce from 79,000 to about 55,000 in three years. Subsequently, some jobs have been transferred to the private sector, but Mr Nakamura believes that ILP will have to cut its workforce by a further 10,000 or more to 18,000 before 1996. There is perhaps even greater concern in Italy's private steel industry, which is also the subject of EU plans for capacity reduction. In June, the Commission agreed to allow capacity cuts of 5m and 6m tonnes in the so-called 'Bresciani' mills in northern Italy, backed by state aid, even though some of the cuts will be achieved through partial closure of plants rather than a complete shutdown as required under a strict interpretation of EU rules. The cuts are considered vital to the success of the EU's plan for overall capacity reductions in the European industry. The industry federation, Federacciai, has estimated that more than a quarter of the 25,000 jobs in the private sector would be lost as a result of the capacity cuts. More than 80 separate plans for closure have been submitted, and a formal decree has been passed by the Italian government, but the process of capacity reduction has not yet got under way. Mr Gnutti, himself a native of Brescia, is likely to discuss the detail of the plan with fellow EU industry ministers in Brussels next month. Unfortunately for these fragmented Italian companies, there is no sign of the improvement in demand which has made larger competitors - for example, in Germany - wonder aloud whether there is any longer a need for an EU-wide steel industry rescue plan. Mr Enrico Badiali, director of Federacciai, says demand, particularly among clients in the Italian building sector, has yet to pick up. 'There are still problems for those private companies which are committed to closure,' he says.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Rod L. Villa] </F>   [Text] Speaker Jose de Venecia unveiled P [Philippine  pesos] 29. 7 billion worth of public works and private sector  infrastuctural and development projects in ceremonies in Baguio  City yesterday.    Most of the projects were being financed with long-term  Japan  loans with counterpart allotments approved by Malacanang  [presidential office] and Congress, De Venecia said before  Rotarians from Bulacan, Nueva Ecija Nueva Vizcaya, Isabela,  Quirino, and Cagayan.    The projects include the P1.2-billion highway between  Rosario  and Pugo Marcos to Baguio City and the P536-million road from  Naguillan to Burgos, La Union, to the Pines City.    With the speaker in surveying the Northern Luzon projects  were Representatives Rolando Andaya head of the House  appropriations committee; Representative Bernardo Vergara of  Baguio City, who helped package the rebuilding program from La  Union to the summer capital for President Ramos; and Secretary  Gregorio Vigilar of public works and highways.    At the former Camp John Hay gathering, De Venecia said  Taiwan's Tuntex Group has allocated P25 billion to redevelop the  tourist city within the former United States military resort  complex.    The Shoemart group led by Henry Sy has decided to build a  P3-billion five star hotel with a shopping megamall in the old  Pines Hotel location.    De Venecia and Vergara announced a P100-million flyover  system between the city and La Trinidad, Benguet, to decongest  the metropolis and create new satellite settlement areas.    De Venecia addressed the 75th anniversary of the Rotary  International District (3770) convention. The district is  headed by its president, Mar Tupaz.    The speaker challenged the Rotarians to harness their  resources in participating in the government's  agro-industrialization program through the  build-operate-transfer law.</p>

			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Prosecutors may seek felony charges against Rep. Donald E. (Buz) Lukens  (R-Ohio) if he successfully appeals a misdemeanor conviction of having sex with  a 16-year-old girl, the prosecutor's office said. The charges would stem from  accusations that Lukens had sex with the same girl when she was 13, said a  spokesman for Franklin County Prosecutor Michael Miller. Lukens, 58, was  sentenced Friday to 30 days in jail and fined $500 on a charge of contributing  to the unruliness of a minor. He is free on bond. A Franklin County jury  convicted Lukens on May 26, after hearing Rosie Coffman testify that Lukens  paid her $40 and gave her gifts after having sex with her at his Columbus,  Ohio, apartment last November.  </P></p>

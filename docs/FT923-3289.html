			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Arts: Lovely modern Vienna THE 1992 Promenade Concerts come to an end tonight, and the best was kept almost to the last. There is no doubt that Pierre Boulez's concert with the Vienna Philharmonic on Thursday was the season's outstanding event, and in many ways its most unlikely one: who would have imagined, even five years ago, that the Vienna Philharmonic, most conservative of the world's great orchestras, would come to the Albert Hall with a programme entirely composed of 20th-century works, including a piece by Boulez himself? In their first of their proms on Wednesday, the orchestra had been heard on more familiar territory, conducted by Claudio Abbado in Haydn's Military Symphony and Mahler's First. By the Vienna's exalted standards that had been a run-of-the-mill affair. Slicked down, big-band Haydn, without a crescendo out of place and everything confined within a narrow, middling dynamic range, was followed by Mahler in which the sum of the beautifully executed parts - luscious, refined string tone, crystalline, characterful wind solos  -offered little more than the sketchiest portrait. Abbado is too perceptive a conductor to be uncaring or meretricious but this seemed nowhere close to the searching, gritty texture of his finest London performances, which promised to set new standards for Mahler interpretation. All such disappointments were vanquished the following evening. Boulez is not the first conductor to bring contemporary music to the Vienna Philharmonic; Abbado's own activities when he was the orchestra's musical director included the inauguration of the Wien Modern festival, to which the Philharmonic was called upon to make a contribution. Yet the exceptional standards produced here - in works that surely are no part of their regular repertoire - had the kind of presence and authority they conventionally bring to the classical staples. It was overwhelmingly convincing. Boulez too seemed galvanised by the occasion. The vivacity that launched the orchestra into Stravinsky's Chant de rossignol, bundling together all its febrile strands, teasing out the lyricism, was at the opposite pole from the tender care with which Debussy's Nocturnes were unveiled, its layers of strings peeled away to reveal yet further perspectives, further exquisite detail. The Vienna wind were outstanding through the evening; they came into their own in Bartok's Miraculous Mandarin, long one of Boulez's most uncompromising performances, with surreal clarinet solos, tumescent trombones and hard-revving trumpets, the whole thing propelled on a writhing body of string tone. Boulez's own Livre pour cordes demands that same kind of high tensile strength. It is one of the most concentrated of his orchestral works, full of proliferating lines, dense-packed chords, explosive pizzicatos. Here it emerged as an immensely passionate piece, bursting with lyrical strength and woven out of rapturous string cantilenas. Concerts like this need to be treasured.</p>

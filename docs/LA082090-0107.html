			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> OFFICIALS BREAK GROUND FOR PARK  </P> <P> Public officials broke ground today for the first new park in the  Sunland-Tujunga area in 10 years.  </P> <P> Finn Park, named for the late City Councilman Howard Finn, is to open in  February in what is now a dusty lot behind the Sunland-Tujunga community  building.  </P> <P> The 2-acre, city-owned parcel is overgrown with weeds and was often used as an  illegal trash dump.  </P> <P> "This is a day we've been waiting for for a long time," said City Councilman  Joel Wachs, one of several officials who dug into the soft dirt with  gold-painted shovels.  </P> <P> Project manager Kathleen Chan said the park will include a children's play area  and a sand volleyball court, as well as picnic tables and barbecue facilities.  </P> <P> Plans call for the creation of a community garden later.  </P></p>

			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Management (The Growing Business): A tale of two serial investors - A successful merger in the food industry Adolf Winter had almost no sales team and no finance director. And yet from a standing start, Winter built Beni Foods over five years into a company with sales of Pounds 85m. Last week he sold it to another well-known name in the meat-processing industry, Ron Randall. For a start-up, this is impressive stuff. What is more, Randall believes Winter has sold at a time when the business - preparing and packaging quality meats for supermarket chains - is still packed with potential. Beni's next phase of development is being entrusted to a kind of businessman and woman which is becoming increasingly important to venture capitalists - a serial investor who puts up equity alongside the venture capitalists and who either brings the deal to the financiers or is brought in as part of a management buy-in team. In this case, Randall brought the deal to the venture capital community. After a beauty parade, he says, he chose a partnership with Morgan Grenfell Development Capital because of its ability to underwrite a deal of this size and its ability to react quickly. Randall had been cutting up meat as a butcher's boy since he was 16, and put together his first meat processing company, Meadow Farm Produce, in 1972 when he was 21. In 1984, he floated Meadow Farm Produce on the Unlisted Securities Market at a value of Pounds 6m. Two years later Hillsdown, the food group, bought it for Pounds 62m. He then reversed a company into Sims Catering Butchers, built the Sims Food Group before resigning in 1991 to build two more food packaging companies, TS&amp;W and Randall Parker. When Randall approached Winter earlier this year, Beni Foods was not for sale. 'My initial approach was, would he consider being part of my ideas,' Randall says. His suggestion that the groups merge was politely declined. 'But he said maybe it is time to consider what to do with the rest of my life.' Winter's background is equally steeped in the food industry. He too built a meat company before selling out to the Trent Meat Company in 1984. He then spent three years researching the market before launching Beni Foods. But it was quite a start-up. On a green field site in Milton Keynes, he built a 45,000sq ft factory and started selling finely sliced quality meats to supermarket chains feeding the consumers' growing appetite for sandwiches. Since then Winter has invested Pounds 36m and built the factory to 190,000sq ft. Randall says that Winter had realised that he needed to put in a top management team. While more junior management was in place, a business that Randall says is heading for Pounds 100m of sales next year was clearly not manageable much longer by Winter alone. The market is rapidly growing in the UK, with 85 per cent of cooked meat going into sandwiches and the market for healthy convenience foods growing apace. Then there is the Continental market. Randall believes the UK could become an important source of prepared quality meats for chains in other European countries. But attacking these markets would only be possible with more management, Randall believes. He will therefore be recruiting a finance director, a managing director, a procurement director and a sales team to work alongside him. And Winter? He will be retained as a consultant for a year but has declined to take a public bow. A private man, he has taken a 'life style' decision and is understood to be returning to his native Austria, leaving two sons with small shareholdings and as active managers in Beni Foods.</p>

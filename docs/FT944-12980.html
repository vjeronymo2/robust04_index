			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Scottish Hydro The City has no doubt that Scottish Hydro-Electric was harshly treated by its regulator when the company's new pricing regime was announced last month. Its shares have underperformed the sector by almost a fifth since August when Professor Stephen Littlechild announced price caps for the 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales. That regime should allow the RECs' distribution businesses to make a real rate of return of around 7 per cent, as will the cap announced for Scottish Power. Yet Scottish Hydro claims its rate of return on distribution will be squeezed to less than 2 per cent. In rejecting the new cap and forcing a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the company appears on strong ground. In its review of British Gas, the commission suggested an appropriate rate of return for a utility would be 6.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent - a judgment that the electricity regulator took into account in his review. Scottish Hydro seems to have been singled out for special treatment because the price corset at privatisation was tied too tightly. Treating it equally now would mean allowing the company's distribution prices to rise significantly relative to other regions. After the political furore that followed Prof Littlechild's generous treatment of the RECs, it is not surprising that he was reluctant to take such a course. There must have been a temptation to follow the water regulator's example with South West Water and pass the hot potato to the commission.</p>

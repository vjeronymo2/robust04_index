			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / BT challenged by AT&amp;T on price of transatlantic calls AMERICAN Telephone and Telegraph, the largest US telecommunications operator, is challenging British Telecom to agree cuts of more than half in the 'wholesale' price of transatlantic phone calls. The result could be significant tariff reductions for customers. AT&amp;T's proposal, for a reduction of about 60 per cent in the accounting rates for telecom traffic between the US and the UK, has become a weapon in the battle between the two telecommunications companies over their pending applications to gain direct access to the public network in each other's countries. Accounting rates are, in effect, the price which BT and Mercury pay AT&amp;T for delivering international calls to their final destination in the US, and vice versa. Rates are set and revised periodically by the operators under an international agreement. AT&amp;T has told the Federal Communications Commission, the US telecoms regulator, that BT has already refused its request for an accounting rate cut. BT yesterday insisted it was still under consideration, and would respond next month. Under strong pressure from the commission, transatlantic accounting rates have been reduced by nearly half over the past two years. AT&amp;T has told the commission that accounting rates could be cut by up to another 60 per cent 'as a first step', with further reductions in line with 'the continuing pace of technology'. Analysts believe AT&amp;T's proposed rates may be close to the actual cost of delivering a transatlantic call. Mr Greg Staples, a Washington consultant, said: 'If AT&amp;T thinks it can connect transatlantic calls from Florida to Montana for half the current charge, it's up to BT to show why it cannot reach London and Manchester for the same fee.' So far operators have had a mutual interest in keeping accounting rates high. But in the current battle over access to each other's markets, both companies are portraying themselves to the regulatory authorities as firm friends of open competition and lower prices. AT&amp;T's argument for lower accounting rates is made in a petition to the FCC opposing BT's application for access to the US's public network. BT pension surplus wiped out, Page 21</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Omar Baez] </F>   [Text] Under close monitoring by Presidential Secretary  Eduardo Bauza, Manuel Mondino, National Commission for Atomic  Energy [CNEA] chairman, and Energy Secretary Carlos Bastos have  begun the path toward the restructuring and privatization of the  CNEA.    The meeting was held 22 March at Eduardo Bauza's office.  CNEA Chairman Mondino and Bastos agreed on the main aspects.  They defined three essential points:    -- The state will create an institution that will regulate  the granting of licenses for operation of the new power plants,  the enforcement of safeguard clauses for operational safety, the  implementation of basic research, and the fulfillment of  international agreements on the subject.    -- One (or several) corporations will be created for the  operation of the nuclear plants and for the implementation of  the other productive activities currently performed by CNEA. At  the beginning the corporations will be totally state-owned, but  the Economy Ministry is studying how to privatize them. The  model in which Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo's team is most  deeply interested is that used with YPF [Government Oil  Deposits].    -- The state will be held responsible for nuclear damage and  for the resolution of the problems caused by radioactive waste  and the dismantling of closed plants. The financing of these  activities will be made on the basis of fees, while private  enterprises operating the plants will designate the state as the  beneficiary of specific insurance policies.    Mondino's CNEA so far monopolizes all nuclear activities,  concerning both research and development and the generation of  energy. A commission made of members of the Energy Secretariat  (Ministry of Economy) and of the CNEA will now evaluate the  various alternatives for structuring and organizing the  entrepreneurial sector.    The commission has one year to complete the restructuring  work. Thus far the only decision is that the nuclear plants and  CNEA productive activities will be regulated by the legislation  applying to the private sector, and that they will have private  capital, in competition with the other enterprises that generate  and sell power on the market.    It still remains to be decided whether a corporation will  run  the entire business, or whether there will be several  corporations that will take care of individual plants and  activities. For example, it is possible to rapidly call for  offers for selling nuclear fuel. The CNEA has already contacted  foreign enterprises that are interested in buying fuel, and some  of them might buy it.    Other matters concerning this uncertain situation have to do  with whether there will be anyone willing to operate the  Atucha-1 or Embalse plants, which are 12 and 20 years old  respectively. Won't privatization of nuclear fuel as a separate  business make the rest of the deal unattractive? Or to what  extent will possible buyers want the state as their local  "partner" with the CNEA men who are now running the plants? The  answers to these questions will determine the method for  transfer to the private sector.    Yet it is certain that the next nuclear plants for which  licenses will be granted will have fully private capital and  that, sooner or later, the private sector will buy part of the  shares of the plants that are operating.    This point, on which the two officials agreed, seems  useless,  because no nuclear plants are now being built in the world  (except for Atucha-2). Yet according to the projections of the  businessmen of the sector, the nuclear business will flourish in  the first years of the next century. And they want to have a  free path at that time.    Another important fact is that construction of Atucha-2 will  be completed in two years, with national budget funds.    The meeting on 22 March closed a harsh phase in which the  Economy Ministry and the CNEA confronted each other over  leadership of the sector. It was a dispute over control of a  budget allocation of more than $1 billion; Cavallo had almost  not even had a chance to learn how this was allocated. At the  same time the leadership of the only productive activity that  had not sunk with the shipwreck of the state was at stake.</p>

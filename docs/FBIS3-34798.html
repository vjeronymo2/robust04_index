The radio  quoted an Interior Ministry statement as saying Mohamed  'Abdallah Abdul Rahman al-Khilaifi, who was first identified as  a Moroccan, is a Libyan. Khilaifi, who has been in Sudan for one  year, was injured when security men engaged the attackers in a  shoot out last Saturday. The statement said his family migrated  from Saudi Arabia to Libya in 1928 and live in the north African  country. The statement identified two attackers who were killed  in the shootout as Abdulabgi Yousif from Chad and Yassir Mohamed  'Ali from Sudan. The two had been described only as "West  Africans" on Sunday.    Meanwhile, the Sudanese President 'Umar al-Bashir, said on  Wednesday that those accused of involvement in the mosque attack  would be given a fair trial. He said the attackers also planned  to kill a Saudi businessman, Usama bin Ladin, who lives in exile  in Sudan.    The Sudanese Government has said there is no link between  the  gunmen and the radical Islamic movement, the Takfir and Hijra  Islamic fundamentalist organization. The movement, which was  born in Egypt during the days of slain Egyptian President Anwar  Sadat, was known for terrorist activities.</p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN LEFT;  </P> <P> WALLPAPERING OVER INEQUALITY;  </P> <P> BUSH'S VETO MEANS BLACK AMERICANS CONTINUE TO BE SHAFTED BY THE SYSTEM.  </P> <P> The substantial number of black Americans in the gulf facing war and maybe  death hear that their commander in chief and President has vetoed the Civil  Rights Act of 1990.  </P> <P> Black Americans already nurture considerable doubts about the wisdom of  President Bush's seeming rush to war. In one poll taken a month ago nearly half  of those polled disagreed with the huge deployment to the gulf. As one black  community leader put it, his people have been fighting a war for 10 years  already, against the economic onslaught launched by Ronald Reagan in 1981.  </P> <P> Politicians (and pundits) are now discovering to their immense surprise just  how angry Americans are at the way the nation's affairs have been conducted in  recent years. Amid this surprise the anger of black Americans is probably less  of a shock, if only because Bush and before him Reagan zealously taunted them  for years, busily bootlicking the white conservative voter. Political  Washington and its flunkys in the academies have invented a whole language to  get round the simple fact that black Americans are being shafted by the system.  The essential message in this language is that blacks have only themselves to  blame, and if only they had proper families and didn't smoke crack, all would  be well.  </P> <P> I was in South-Central Los Angeles last week, visiting the Southern California  Library for Social Studies and Research. A guest curator, Sophie Spalding, has  mounted a photographic exhibition of the Watts rebellion whose 25th anniversary  fell on August 11. Where the library now stands at 6120 So. Vermont there was  once an appliance store. In those mid-August days of 1965 two black Americans  were killed by either the LAPD or the National Guard in front of a store later  burned out.  </P> <P> What was particularly striking in the news clips and photo spreads on the  library walls and in display cases was its emphasis on the irrationality of the  rising across South-Central. Both journalists and cartoonists depicted the  rioters as a bunch of simian drunks betraying the high purpose of such leaders  as Martin Luther King. President Johnson took the same tack, saying the  uprising bore no relation to the orderly struggle for civil rights.  </P> <P> The almost reflexive stratagems of overdog propaganda were also indicated in  the photos and captions of the Aug. 30, 1965, Life magazine. Here again the  message of utter irrationality was strongly and often subtly stated. Life's  cover showed a black man carrying furniture, with the caption "Los Angeles  resident flees his home set afire in the riot." Implication: The rioters burned  out their own people. But the rebellion was a response to years of brutality  and commercial exploitation. The targets were therefore the police and  businesses that South-Central folk knew had been ripping them off for years.  Scarcely any homes were burned.  </P> <P> Another Life photograph showed national guardsmen bending over a  Mexican-American in an attitude of concern. The caption said he had been  wounded by a black mob. Implication: blacks against whites and browns. It's  possible the episode occurred, though there's no record of it. Records do show  Mexican-Americans killed by the LAPD or the National Guard.  </P> <P> When the peril had passed, came "understanding." On Aug. 19, 1965, the Los  Angeles Times ran an editorial quoting the analysis of a "respected Negro  psychiatrist," said analysis commencing with "Breakdown of Negro family life."  Thus, making their appearance were two props of concerned editorialists  pondering black rage at injustice: the helpful (and always "respected") black  psychiatrist and the disintegrating black family, as explanatory pathology  launched by Daniel Patrick Moynihan at exactly that time.  </P> <P> In the wake of the rebellion there were, naturally, promises to rehab the area,  address the grievances. Twenty years later Watts got a fortified shopping mall.  Instead of Police Chief William Parker who said the rioters were like monkeys  in a zoo, the city has Parker's former driver, Daryl Gates, who says casual  drug users should be taken out and shot. In black communities the signs of  poverty mount, in figures for infant mortality and kindred indexes. Once again  there's a fake language to deal with such statistics and occlude the truth that  blacks are being shafted. There's decorous talk about the "lack of prenatal  care" and kindred verbal wallpaper over the ugly structure of inequality.  </P> <P> Bush vetoed the civil-rights act and the Senate sustained him because they  thought they could get away with it. Chief Parker's men beat up blacks 25 years  ago because they thought they could get away with it. Politics is partly the  business of knowing when you can't get away with it any more, and this is where  President Bush may have misjudged his decade.  </P></p>

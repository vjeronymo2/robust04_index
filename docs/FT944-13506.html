			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: UBS The battle over Union Bank of Switzerland's special voting shares could be moving in the board's favour. Mr Martin Ebner, the Zurich financier, has accumulated a large position in the bank's registered shares - which have extra voting power - with the aim of forcing changes in UBS's strategy. The board has countered by pushing for the abolition of the registered shares' privileges and their conversion into bearer shares. Yesterday, following the publication of the board's latest missive on the subject, the premium enjoyed by the registered shares over bearer shares sank to 15 per cent. For most of the year, the premium has been over 25 per cent. UBS's desire for a single class of shares is all very well. But its method of achieving it flies in the face of natural justice. The change in share structure will be put to a combined vote by both bearer and registered investors. That means the registered shares could lose their privileges, even if most vote against the board's proposal at next month's shareholder meeting. UBS argues that the new share structure would benefit the registered shareholders because it would stop Mr Ebner forcing a change in strategy that would damage the bank. That seems implausible, since the premium enjoyed by the registered shares would vanish completely if the board carried the day. The least UBS should do is allow registered shareholders a separate vote on the proposals. If the board is so confident in its case, it should have nothing to fear.</p>

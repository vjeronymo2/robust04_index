			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Olga Semenova] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 29 TASS -- Hans Blix, director of the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), met with Director of  the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) Yevgeniy Primakov  on Wednesday and sources in the SRV indicated that Blix wants  Russian intelligence information on nuclear non-proliferation  problem.    "The Foreign Intelligence has never concealed that  monitoring  the proliferation of nuclear weapons is among our priority  tasks", a high ranking intelligence official told TASS.    He added that the IAEA relies in its activities on the  information received from us and British secret services not  only through their corresponding governments, but also directly  from the intelligence bodies.    "It is quite logical that the IAEA director intends to  establish closer cooperation in the given field with the Russian  intelligence as well in order to get a more objective picture",  the official said adding that the "exchange of such information  is in mutual interests".</p>

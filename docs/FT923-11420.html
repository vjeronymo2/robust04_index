			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Castle in the air bumps down to earth: Euro Disneyland's opening has been a rocky ride Judging by its name, Operation Mickey sounded like a promotion Euro Disneyland might have mounted to bolster its disappointing attendance figures. But instead, it was organised by some 500 French farmers who four weeks ago turned up at the gates of the new theme park outside Paris. The farmers were protesting against the building of Euro Disney on agricultural land and against US pressure for reforms to European agricultural policy. More than 2,000 school children were kept out of the park until the farmers drove their tractors away after lunch. Attracting enough French visitors was always going to be one problem facing Euro Disney. Variable weather - and thus widely fluctuating admissions - was another. Although the company is learning how to adapt its product to meet European tastes and to manage its operations more flexibly, the changes are coming too slowly to avoid a loss in this fiscal year ending September. It might not avoid further red ink next year. Smith New Court, the London broker, forecasts a loss of at least FFr200m (Pounds 20.4m) for this year, possibly followed by a worse performance next year, which will include the first winter trading period. Euro Disney originally hoped for 11m visitors in its first year of operation. The park has attracted 3.6m people since it opened in April. Given that spring and summer are expected to have higher than average attendance levels, this means that, unless there is a sudden improvement, Euro Disney is unlikely to meet its target. The crux of the problem is the low number of French visitors who have accounted for less than 30 per cent of the total, against a forecast of 50 per cent. Euro Disney does have the consolation that visits from the UK and Germany are above expectations and foreign visitors tend to spend more as they are more likely to stay in the resort hotels. However, the six Euro Disney hotels are performing 'slightly below expectations' with average occupancy of 70 per cent so far. There has been an improvement in overall attendance since the start of the European school holidays. This week Euro Disney has been attracting capacity crowds with 95 per cent occupancy at the hotels. However, the first year's attendance is still likely to be 20 per cent lower than expected at less than 9m people, according to Paribas in London. This could pose a serious financial problem in that Euro Disney is a highly geared business with substantial fixed costs, such as interest payments and amortised construction costs, representing more than 75 per cent of total costs. That makes it very vulnerable to any reduction in revenue. The obvious solution is to cut variable costs, chiefly by bringing employment in line with attendance. The Disney parks in the US are extremely efficient at this. They have developed sophisticated forecasting techniques enabling them to alter staffing levels and food supplies on a daily basis. Euro Disney plans to make similar adjustments. Mr John Forsgren, finance director, said staffing levels will vary from 17,000 in the peak summer season to around 12,500 in the slack winter months. But at present it is difficult for Euro Disney to forecast accurately. The California and Florida parks, which opened in 1955 and 1971 respectively, have the benefit of years of data. Euro Disneyland will eventually build up similar records. Indeed it should be more efficient at budgeting from next April, when it has its first year of information. But Euro Disney's forecasting is unlikely ever to be as accurate as its US counterparts because of its location. First, the climate in Paris is less predictable than in sunny California and Florida. Second, the US parks have the advantage of being large tourist attractions in their areas. This means that Walt Disney World in Florida can use data on the number of cars crossing the state border to calculate what proportion is likely to visit the park. By contrast, Euro Disneyland is only one of dozens of attractions in Paris. The immediate challenge for Euro Disney is to increase attendance. In some respects it is not surprising that its performance in the economically sluggish early 1990s has not met the targets set in the bullish late 1980s. But Euro Disney also needs to identify which areas should be adapted to suit European taste. Catering arrangements have already been changed to increase the availability of fast food. Euro Disney is in talks with tour operators to change next year's hotel rates. It is also negotiating winter hotel discounts and organising an autumn promotional programme for France. Euro Disney does at least have the consolation that it has performed better than Tokyo Disneyland, the only other Disney park outside the US. Tokyo attracted just 2.5m visitors in its first 102 days - against 3.6m for Euro Disney - and 10.5m visitors in its first year.</p>

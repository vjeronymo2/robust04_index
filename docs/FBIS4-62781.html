			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- "The difficult arguments on  property, land and taxes, occurring ever more frequently among  the parties to market relations in Russia, bring to light all  the merits and still large demerits of our civil law," Chairman  of the Russian Supreme Court of Arbitration Veniamin Yakovlev  told the international conference on civil legislation, which  opened here today.    Yakovlev expressed the hope that this meeting would "help  establish truly democratic laws for the everyday life of our  democratic society". The conference was organised by the  Institute of Law and Comparative Jurisprudence under the Russian  Government, jointly with the Supreme Court of Arbitation. It is  being attended by members of the private law centre under the  Russian president, jurists, economists, and businessmen from the  CIS countries and other foreign states.    The 1964 civil code of the Russian Soviet Federative  Socialist Republic, which is now in force, was drawn up to  service the administrative-command system and, of course, does  not guarantee contractual freedom in the new economic  conditions, the speakers noted. Moreover, it legalises the  inequality of the forms of ownership, giving preference to  state-owned property.    The adoption of the new Russian civil code must be  accelerated to ensure legal backing to the market economy. The  parliamentary hearings on its draft, to which the participants  of the conference were invited, will be held at the State Duma  building on May 19. The civil code must be "a fundamental law,  laying down the overall legal principles of market relationships  in the country".    The private law, which is now being revived in Russia, must  protect the people's ownership rights, including the right to  the results of intellectual labour, must regulate relations  among people, based on equality. Several such laws are already  in force, including the laws on privatisation, business  transactions, banks, investments, competition, restriction of  monopolism, copyrights and attendant rights. Laws have also  been adopted to protect the rights of consumers, to guarantee  the free movement of citizens, and the freedom of the mass  media. However, they do not regulate all the spheres of the  market economy and all the relationships between the civilian  society and the private life of citizens.    The conference participants plan to address recommendations,  linked with the elaboration of the Russian civil legislation, to  the Federal Assembly (parliament) of Russia and to the  parliaments of other CIS states.</p>

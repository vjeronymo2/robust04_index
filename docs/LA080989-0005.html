			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PORT COMMISSIONERS URGE UNIFORM FARE RATE FOR TAXIS  </P> <P> San Diego port commissioners Tuesday called for a uniform fare rate for cab  companies that serve the airport, with one commissioner warning that it might  be necessary to establish a taxi franchise at Lindbergh Field if the current  rate system is not changed.  </P> <P> Board Chairman Louis Wolfsheimer called the current system of variable rates "a  rip-off." Under this system, cab companies are allowed to set their own fares,  up to a maximum rate, which is changed periodically.  </P> <P> Wolfsheimer warned that if a uniform rate is not established, the San Diego  Unified Port District might recommend a taxi franchise at Lindbergh Field, and  at the same time do away with most of the 150 cabs from different companies  that are allowed at the airport every day.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Silly Idea'  </P> <P> "I think it was a silly idea to go to deregulation," said Wolfsheimer. He added  that since the Port District runs the airport, port commissioners also have the  authority to set taxi rates for trips originating at Lindbergh Field.  </P> <P> Variable rates, which resulted from local deregulation of the industry 10 years  ago, have spurred hundreds of complaints from tourists and local citizens  alike, who feel they are being cheated. It is not unusual for a passenger to  pay, say, $15 for a ride from the airport to a Mission Valley hotel with one  company, and only $10 for a return trip in another cab.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Wolfsheimer and other commissioners urged the Metropolitan Transit  Development Board, which regulates the taxi industry, to institute a uniform  rate. The MTDB is finishing a monthlong survey of about 1,500 cab patrons to  learn if the public favors uniform rates. Except for a handful of small  independent companies, most local cab firms have come out in favor of a uniform  rate system.  </P> <P> </P> <P> System Rejected  </P> <P> The subject of using a separate meter for cabs authorized to work at the  airport was briefly discussed and rejected. Anthony Palmeri, vice president and  general manager of Yellow Cab, warned that a two-meter system is used in New  Orleans and has caused more problems than it has solved.  </P> <P> Airport officials said that uniform rates would also help the congestion at  Lindbergh Field and improve service. Occasionally, problems arise when  disgruntled drivers, hoping for a long haul and bigger fare, refuse to take  passengers to hotels at nearby Harbor and Shelter islands.  </P> <P> In addition, officials said that uniform rates would also end the practice of  fare shopping at the airport, which slows down the taxi line. Under a uniform  system, it would be "first up, first out," they said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Subsidy Suggested  </P> <P> Some opponents of uniform rates have charged that such a system would punish  seniors and low-income residents, who are currently able to shop around for low  fares. However, Palmeri suggested that the MTDB subsidize fares for the poor,  like a program in effect in San Francisco. In San Francisco, cab companies turn  over a percentage of their fares to a government agency, which uses the revenue  to subsidize cab rides for low-income passengers, said Palmeri.  </P> <P> San Diego is the only major city in California that does not have uniform cab  fares.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A high-placed source in the Moscow Kremlin told  Interfax President Yeltsin could call a nationwide referendum in  the hope of having his term in office extended. Addressing  Vladimir Shumeyko's suggestion for an extension, for another two  years, of both the president's and parliament's mandates, the  anonymous source said Yeltsin stood the best chance to win  presidential elections in 1996 and would be unlikely to allow  the State Duma and Federation Council decide how long he was to  stay in office.    But, the source admitted that Shumeyko's initiative was  logical and made sense. It would allow the mostly newcomer  politicians to learn what was what and concentrate on law-making.    The source said Shumeyko's initiative was a touchstone and  the Administration's response to it would depend on whether it  was endorsed by the lawmakers, leading political parties and  movements and other influential forces.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Foreign Affairs Celso Luis Nunes </F> Amorim by Nely Caixeta, during the first week of May 1994; place  not given: "Market for Our Products Has Grown"]    [Text]Ambassador Celso Luis Nunes Amorim took over  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 10 months ago at a crucial  moment for any diplomat in a similar post. After nearly eight  years of protracted talks involving more than 100 countries, the  Uruguay Round--as the GATT negotiations were called--had finally  ended. In the middle of last month, Amorim, 52, who is a native  of Santos, Sao Paulo, a former president of Embrafilme  [Brazilian Film Company], and a former head of Brazil's  delegation to Geneva, put his signature on the concluding  agreements of the Uruguay Round and the new World Trade  Organization. The ceremony, which was held in Marrakech,  Morocco, will have a guaranteed place in history if the  liberalization of trade called for in the new order succeeds in  achieving the promised revolution--a growth in world trade that  may reach $700 billion per year. In Amorim's opinion, the new  business opportunities for Brazil are exceptional. Regarded in  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a firm negotiator, Amorim is  alert to other challenges. A little over two months ago, for  example, he put his capabilities to the test when he was able at  the last minute to ward off trade sanctions that the United  States was threatening to impose as a protest against the delay  in approving the new Industrial Property Law. Last week he  granted the following interview to EXAME.    [Caixeta] What is Brazil gaining from the GATT Uruguay Round  agreement?    [Amorim] The most tangible impact will be an increase in  exports as a result of two factors: the opening up of the world  market and the establishment of more stable rules for  international trade. Estimates of that impact vary considerably.  Forecasts indicate that world trade will grow by between $250  billion and $700 billion per year. Obviously, that impact will  not be immediate because some of the measures agreed on in the  Uruguay Round will not take effect until 10 years from now.  Assuming that Brazil retains its current share of international  trade (slightly less than one percent of the total), it can be  expected that our exports will rise by between $2.5 billion and  $7 billion per year.    [Caixeta] Some people consider those estimates too timid.    [Amorim] That additional $2.5 billion in our annual exports  does in fact represent a conservative estimate. There are also  the secondary effects that the liberalization of trade is going  to have on economic growth itself. These estimates do not take  into account the fact that we now have more stable rules for  trade. Last year, for example, Brazil was in danger of losing  from $200 million to $300 million because of antidumping  measures applied by the United States to Brazilian steel  exports. We did not lose that full amount because some of the  measures in question were never implemented, but our steel  exports were delayed. Stable rules are a basic factor as far as  the firms are concerned, because when exporting their products,  they must follow some kind of planning. It is not that  antidumping measures are going to disappear beginning now. They  will diminish, however, and we will be more certain of being  able to take our complaints to the World Trade Organization,  which replaces GATT. This means that we will be treated more  appropriately.    [Caixeta] Which sectors of the Brazilian economy will  probably be the first to benefit from the new rules on  international trade?    [Amorim] The developed countries are supposed to lower their  tariffs by an average of 38 percent. Brazil has a very  diversified economy. It exports everything from relatively  simple products to computer software. Barriers will also be  eliminated in three sectors that are very important to us:  agriculture, textiles, and steel. In the case of agriculture,  the complicated import rules imposed by the European Union will  be gradually eliminated over a six-year period. The same thing  will happen in the case of textiles over a 10-year period. Also  to be eliminated is the quota system based on so-called  voluntary restriction agreements. In Brazil's case, that system  affected steel in particular.    [Caixeta] What impact will the reduction of export  subsidies--especially in the agricultural area--have on  Brazilian producers?    [Amorim] As far as Brazil is concerned, this is very  important. We are losing sales in several traditional  markets--the Near East, Asia, and East Europe--because of the  farm subsidies paid by the European Union and the United States.  One side used to justify its own subsidies on the grounds of  those paid by the other. Over a six-year period, the total value  of those subsidies will be reduced by 36 percent. That is not  much, but it is a start.    [Caixeta] Including the service sector in the Uruguay Round  was not well received by the Brazilian Government when the talks  began back in 1986. What is the government's current assessment  of that aspect of the agreement?    [Amorim] It is true that the liberalization of trade in  services frightened us at first. There was concern over  competition from the developed countries. But Brazilian firms  offer very efficient services in certain fields. Engineering  services are one example. Bank automation is another. Today we  even export software. Moreover, I was surprised to learn that  Brazil is in a good position to export attorney services and  legal consulting services.    [Caixeta] How do you view the pressure that the rich  countries are beginning to put on the developing countries in  connection with what they call social dumping--that is, their  threat to set up barriers against countries where wages are low?    [Amorim] That is a new protectionist threat by the developed  countries. At a time when markets are beginning to open up, we  are seeing the emergence of this new issue, which can be used as  a protectionist barrier. Incidentally, the environment issue may  also be used that way. This does not mean that those issues in  themselves are not legitimate. They must be debated. The doubt I  have, especially on the labor issue, is whether it is right to  tie the issue of low wages to trade. I can give you an example.  I was in Marrakech, Morocco, for the signing of the Uruguay  Round agreement. It is a very beautiful city of medieval origin,  and today it is a big tourist center. All one had to do was  leave the hotel and go downtown to see minors working. What  might they be doing if they were not working? Would they be  attending school, begging for handouts, or doing something  worse? Obviously, no one can be in favor of the exploitation of  manpower, but matters that must be resolved in Brazil in a  sovereign manner cannot be left in the hands of foreign  protectionist interests.    [Caixeta] Have you been discussing these matters with the  labor unions?    [Amorim] I have been talking to the president of the CUT  [Sole Workers Center], Jair Meneguelli. There have been contacts  with other central unions, and they have also expressed their  views on the matter. Unions in Brazil are free. They fully  protect the interests of the workers. Brazil is a country where  there are strikes even in the Budget Department. I lived in  developed countries for years and never saw anything like that.  It is through union freedom and freer trade abroad that our  social conditions will improve, not as a result of sanctions  imposed by other countries. I want to sponsor a seminar where  that topic will be debated with the workers, people in  government and other interested sectors, and the academic world.  We have seen many noble causes being used as a pretext for  protectionist measures. We cannot leave it up to an orange juice  producer in the United States to decide in the future whether  the manpower used by the juice industry in Brazil is well paid  or poorly paid. If action is taken on the grounds of some  alleged social dumping, regardless of whether it affects  Brazilian footwear, steel, or orange juice, the effect will be  higher unemployment in those areas.    [Caixeta] When you arrived in the United States to discuss  the issue of patents, there were only a few days left before the  introduction of trade reprisals against Brazil. How did you  manage to reverse that situation?    [Amorim] I spoke frankly. That is the main thing if you want  to win people's confidence. It is essential not to try to  conceal, deceive, or promise things that are impossible. In that  way we were able to lay a few ghosts to rest. The issue of  intellectual property has developed into an emotion-filled  subject over the course of many years. There were already scars  in Brazil because of retaliatory measures and sanctions imposed  by the United States. But basically, reality today is not what  it was when the discussion began. Today we have the GATT  agreement. The Americans were previously in the habit of talking  about legislation on a worldwide scale. But what did that mean?  There were no parameters. Simple compliance with the Uruguay  Round agreement would be enough to solve 95 percent of the  problems.    [Caixeta] The Brazilian Government is proposing the  establishment of a free trade area in South America. What  benefits will that bring us in addition to those we already have  in our relations with ALADI [Latin American Integration  Association]?    [Amorim] ALADI is an agreement whose long-range objective is  to create a common market in Latin America. But in concrete  terms, it functions only as an umbrella organization for  fostering sectoral agreements. So far, ALADI has resulted in  limited negotiations. There are agreements on a certain number  of products, but most products are not covered.    [Caixeta] Then what is the objective as far as the free  trade  area in South America is concerned?    [Amorim] What we want in South America, based on our  experience with Mercosur [Common Market of the South], is a more  extensive liberalization of all tariffs and nontariff barriers  over a period of 10 years. We want to reverse the situation that  exists today. The fact is that we negotiate only 20 percent of  the tariff schedule. Everything else is considered exempt. We  must protect only what is absolutely sensitive. The South  American countries belonging to ALADI--excluding those belonging  to Mercosur--now account for about 8 percent of our export  market. It can be said that that is not much, but the picture  changes when you consider that 80 percent of what we export to  those countries consists of manufactured goods, unlike what we  export to the developed countries.    [Caixeta] What is your assessment of the criticism directed  at the implementation of Mercosur? Is it not true that the  objectives of commercial integration as expressed in the  Asuncion Treaty were too ambitious or unrealistic, as some  people claim?    [Amorim] We have already benefited noticeably from the  integration process. Trade with the three Mercosur countries  today accounts for 13 percent of our exports. Before the  Asuncion Treaty eight years ago, it amounted to only 4.5  percent. There has been breathtaking growth. But if you take all  the objectives of the Asuncion Treaty literally, it is true that  they have not been fully achieved.    [Caixeta] A few weeks ago, President Itamar Franco sent a  letter to the presidents of the Mercosur countries explaining  the Brazilian position on NAFTA. What did that letter say?    [Amorim] We said that Brazil took a positive view of NAFTA  and that we would be ready to talk as a group--all four  countries--whenever invited. The letter had two main objectives.  First, to dissipate doubts about Brazil's interest in the  matter. Yes, we are interested in participating in NAFTA when we  are invited to do so. Second, Brazil wants to negotiate together  with its Mercosur partners. But the United States, Mexico, and  Canada are still digesting NAFTA and the Uruguay Round itself.  It will do no good for us to stand there knocking on the door  when we know that they are not ready to open it.    [Caixeta] Is it not possible that behind the establishment  of  that free trade zone in South America is a strategic motive--in  other words, a desire to increase the region's bargaining power  when and if the invitation comes to discuss integration with  NAFTA?    [Amorim] That might in fact happen as a consequence. But the  objective is not to form a bloc. It is obvious that by opening  up their markets to each other, the economies in the region will  grow stronger. And that, obviously, will help in any other  international negotiation.</p>

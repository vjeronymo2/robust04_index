			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Flying start for Pakistan privatisation programme - International offerings The success of Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation's ambitious international offering of 5m vouchers, exchangeable into shares in the future privatised utility, has shown that, despite more difficult market conditions, investors can still get excited about the right sort of deal. 'The one type of deal still capable of surprising us is an emerging market transaction in a promising sector,' said one investment banker. The 5m vouchers were priced on Friday at Rs5,500, raising Dollars 900m for the Pakistani government. The government originally aimed to raise just Dollars 500m, at a price of Rs3,000. When joint lead manager Jardine Fleming came to allocate the transaction on Friday, it was twice oversubscribed. 'We had done a domestic offering priced at Rs3,000, knowing that it was a relatively small tranche (less than 2 per cent of the size of the company),' said Mr Naveed Qamar, chairman of Pakistan's privatisation commission. When the government subsequently decided to sell almost 10 per cent of the company through an international offering, its advisers said it would have to be at the same price. However, the strong performance of the initial offering soon made it clear that the deal could be completed on tighter terms, and an initial mandate awarded to UBS was withdrawn. Jardine Fleming subsequently completed the deal at almost twice the price, winning widespread praise for its handling of the transaction. One reason for Jardine Fleming's success was the structure of the deal. By making the vouchers available in the form of dollar-denominated global depositary receipts, which can be cleared through Euroclear and Cedel, the deal proved attractive to investors who might have been deterred by having to deal with the local currency. According to an official at Jardine Fleming, around 25 per cent of the deal was placed in the US, 25 per cent in the UK, 25 per cent in the Far East and the remainder with expatriate Pakistani investors, mostly based in the Middle East. The vouchers, which are traded on the Karachi Stock Exchange, rose to Rs6,000 on Friday, on the news of the successful completion of the offering. The government has made a commitment to buy back vouchers at Rs3,800, in the event that they are not converted into shares as a result of privatisation by 1996. The deal has successfully kicked off the government's ambitious privatisation programme. The transaction will be followed by a 26 per cent strategic sale of PTC, and then by other deals, including thermal power plants and financial institutions. Mr Qamar said that in almost all cases the government will try to place paper with international investors, as they are too large to be completed solely on the domestic market. However, investment bankers cautioned against viewing the deal as marking a return to favour of emerging markets, or any strong preference for Pakistan. The deal benefited from the fact that the telecommunications business is widely viewed as an attractive means of entrance into an emerging economy. 'Typically, it's a business where there is fat to cut, but at the same time there is an enormous growth potential as the underlying economy grows,' said one investment banker. In the case of PTC, the network is expected to expand by 30 per cent annually, having nearly doubled since 1992. In the past, investors have done well by buying telecom stocks at an early stage in an emerging market's development, for example in the case of Mexico's Telmex.</p>

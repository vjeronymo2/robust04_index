			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / AFG sale severs Botnar's UK motor link: Barclay brothers buy car retailer for estimated Pounds 200m Automotive Financial Group Holdings, one of the biggest UK motor retailer groups, controlled by Mr Octav Botnar, has been sold to the Barclay brothers, the reclusive UK entrepreneurs, in a deal understood to be worth about Pounds 200m. The deal, one of the biggest acquisitions ever made in the UK retail motor industry, marks the first entry into the sector of the Barclay twins, who have built a private fortune based on property, shipping and hotels, and who in 1992 bought The European newspaper from the wreckage of the late Mr Robert Maxwell's business empire. The purchase is understood to include all the retail motor network of Automotive and Financial Group (AFG), comprising more than 70 dealerships, as well as Automotive Financial Services, AFGH's finance division. AFG is one of the biggest UK multi-franchise dealer groups representing some of the world's leading carmakers including Fiat, Citroen, Peugeot, Renault, Honda and Vauxhall (General Motors). Mr David and Mr Frederick Barclay, identical twins based in Monaco, face the immediate task of winning backing for the takeover from these carmakers, of which at least one is understood to have been considering the withdrawal of its franchise from AFG because of dissatisfaction over its operating performance. The AFGH group achieved an overall pre-tax profit of Pounds 11.05m in the financial year to the end of July 1993 but only due to a pre-tax profit of Pounds 27.8m achieved by Automotive Financial Services and a pre-tax profit of Pounds 4.6m from the group's property division. The AFG motor dealer operations fell to a pre-tax loss of Pounds 21.2m. AFG was forced to undertake a drastic restructuring in response to the loss of the Nissan importer/distributor franchise by its sister company Nissan UK in 1991. The sale of the business to the Barclay brothers marks the effective withdrawal from the UK motor industry of Mr Botnar, one of the sector's most controversial figures, who has lived in Switzerland since 1992, when a warrant was issued for his arrest by the Inland Revenue. In the late 1980s, Mr Botnar, now 81, controlled one of the most lucrative privately-owned motor businesses in the UK with a pre-tax profit in the 12 months to the end of July 1990 of Pounds 142.6m on a turnover of Pounds 1.76bn. This included Nissan UK - a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nissan UK Holdings - which held the importer/distributor franchise for Nissan vehicles in Britain and controlled 6 per cent of the UK new car market, as well as the AFG retail motor business, which at its peak had as many as 180 dealerships. Mr Botnar's operations have been in turmoil, however, since Nissan Motor, the Japanese carmaker, took away the Nissan franchise amid a legal battle with effect from the end of 1991. Nissan UK has been at the centre of Britain's biggest corporation tax fraud. Last year Mr Michael Hunt, a director of NUK, was sentenced to eight years in prison for conspiring at NUK to defraud the Inland Revenue of Pounds 55m in corporation tax. An arrest warrant was issued for Mr Botnar, but he has never returned to the UK. Secretive trio: Page 24</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Marian Schmarcz: "Control Means Credibility </F> for Secret Services"]    [Text] Despite the fact that intelligence services belong  to executive bodies, it is impossible to apply the same open  system of parliamentary control to them as to other central  bodies. Intelligence services work with secrets on the  preservation of which the security of the state depends. On the  other hand, secret services pose a potential danger to human  rights. The system of control over them has to take these two  peculiarities into account.    In our country, this mechanism has been worked out for only  the Security and Information Service [BIS]. The intelligence  service and the Army's intelligence departments are working  safely hidden under the shell of the Interior Ministry and the  Defense Ministry, where they are based. According to BIS  director Devaty, however, it is very unreasonable to reject  parliamentary control. Parliamentary control most efficiently  disperses suspicion that, under the lid of the intelligence pot,  a dark soup of intrigues and political conspiracy is boiling.    It is usual in the world that primary control over the work  of secret services is performed by the government, who also uses  secret services' information to make decisions. Audit is a  strong tool in this respect. The very fact that funds are being  allocated to them on the basis of specific assignments keeps a  tight hand on the intelligence service members. It is difficult  to imagine that agents would finance possible subversive actions  from their own funds.    Intelligence activity, however, closely touches upon the  human rights guaranteed by the Constitution. In the BIS case,  the applicable law allows imposing limitations on them.  Independent judges (as regards utilization of intelligence  gathering technology, for instance), as well as a special  parliamentary body, keep an eye on the respect for this law.  This arrangement is usual in a number of European countries; it  is not a rule, however. In the Netherlands, for example, this  supervision is performed by a commission of selected ministers.    Our experience with the former State Security has led us to  establish permanent and preventive parliamentary supervision  over BIS, unlike in Great Britain, for instance, where the  appropriate institutions inspect secret services only on the  basis of a specific complaint. In France, there is no control  over counterintelligence, which is part of the police.    Our deputies have at their disposal all of BIS's internal  regulations (on record-keeping, internal control, etc.), and,  thanks to that fact, they know how to proceed. From the  accounting documents they receive, they can get a rough picture  of BIS activities in individual spheres. They conduct their  audits directly at workplaces of the secret service, and they  can demand any data from the archive without any limitation.  The principle of hierarchic limitation on access to information  does not apply to them. Anyone at BIS who wants to see his  colleague's folder must give a specific reason for that. The  Czech secret service introduced these barriers after its bad  experience with the former Federal Security and Information  Service. It was precisely its benevolent internal regulations  that made it easy for Wallis to dig into secret files.    Actions that are in progress, however, are the prohibited  zone, where the secret service refuses to admit the deputies.  The results of the secret service are always directly  proportional to the extent to which the leak of information can  be prevented. The service employees themselves do not know  agents other than those to whom they directly give assignments.  The law on BIS requires that the security of these people be  protected, and data on them must not be divulged, not even to  deputies.    Devaty concluded a gentleman's agreement with deputies that,  at their request, he would close any file to allow them to  inspect it. At the same time, he requires from the deputies that  they assume their burden of responsibility for the possible  consequences this could have on the security of the state or the  lives of BIS members, who could be endangered by the deputies'  indiscretion. Nothing like that has happened, however; on the  other hand, no case of a well-founded complaint about the  violation of human rights has been recorded.    A secret service worthy of that name will certainly never  admit anyone from outside into its most intimate places, which  are the files of the agents and cases in progress. If some law  forced them to make these documents accessible, the intelligence  staffers would rather keep their knowledge in their heads or  somewhere else, leaving empty folders for the controllers. On  the other hand, it is in the interest of all of the secret  services to be as open as possible to parliamentary control (by  opposition deputies, above all), if it is possible from the  viewpoint of their operation. However, absolutely  nontransparent military and police intelligence departments are  hiding in the shadow of BIS, which is controlled by parliament  and which operates according to law. This is not to the benefit  of the credibility of special services as a whole.</p>

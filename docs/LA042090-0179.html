			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> APOLOGETIC ROSE PLEADS GUILTY;  </P> <P> TAXES: ALREADY BANNED FROM BASEBALL, THE FORMER REDS MANAGER'S ADMISSION OF  HIDING INCOME FURTHER IMPERILS HIS CHANCE OF GETTING INTO THE HALL OF FAME.  </P> <P> A somber and apologetic Pete Rose, banished from baseball for life eight months  ago for gambling, pleaded guilty today to cheating on his taxes by hiding more  than a third of a million dollars in income.  </P> <P> Among the earnings Rose failed to report, federal prosecutors revealed in court  today, was $129,000 he got for selling the bat with which he broke Ty Cobb's  all-time hitting record in 1985.  </P> <P> Rose, 49, the game's all-time hits leader, will be sentenced at a later date by  U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel. He could draw as much as a six-year  prison sentence, but U.S. Atty. D. Michael Crites refused to speculate on  whether Rose will wind up behind bars.  </P> <P> "I am truly sorry for what has happened, and not just because I have had to  leave baseball, the sport I love," Rose said in a written statement before he  entered court.  </P> <P> "My family and friends have suffered as well, and I regret the the pain I have  caused them. I mean that from the bottom of my heart," he added.  </P> <P> "I also realize that millions of baseball fans may have been disappointed  because I didn't live up to the respect and admiration they gave me during my  career. I am not a bad person, but I did some bad things."  </P> <P> In court today, prosecutors painted a picture of a man so obsessed by gambling  that he sold his autographs and prized possessions to cover his losses.  </P> <P> They revealed that Rose has already paid the government $366,000 in back taxes,  interest and penalties, a sum considerably larger than the roughly $162,000 in  taxes they said he owed on the income he pleaded guilty to failing to report.  </P> <P> Rose acknowledged that his appetite for gambling, which investigators said left  him in hock to a New York bookmaker for $400,000 at one point, led to his  trouble with the tax collectors.  </P> <P> He pleaded guilty to two counts of filing false federal income tax returns in  1985 and 1987, involving failure to report more than $354,000 in income from  personal appearances, the sale of memorabilia and gambling, according to court  records.  </P> <P> During his brief court appearance, Rose, dressed in a dark blue business suit,  was somber save a flicker of a smile when the judge asked him if he was under  under the influence of any drugs and cognizant of what he was doing.  </P> <P> "Yes sir, I'm clearheaded," Rose said.  </P> <P> The plea, worked out with the government, avoided an indictment on what might  have been more serious charges.  </P> <P> But if left Rose's future in baseball even more cloudy.  </P> <P> At the time he was banished from the game last August by the late Baseball  Commissioner Bart Giamatti, Rose said he expected his exile to be a short one.  He will be eligible to apply for reinstatement this August, one year after he  was kicked out.  </P> <P> The tax troubles may also have further damaged the former Cincinnati Reds  manager's chances for election to the Baseball Hall of Fame -- something that  had been considered almost automatic until his tax troubles surfaced last year.  </P> <P> Rose, however, made an appeal to the baseball writers who will vote in a year  and a half on whether to put him in the baseball shrine.  </P> <P> "I hope they'll understand that the mistakes I made off the field were caused  by my gambling disorder. In 1991, I hope they'll see that I came clean about my  problems, got help and stayed out of trouble," he said today.  </P> <P> The highlight of Rose's 24-year baseball career was when he surpassed Cobb's  long-time record with 4,256 base hits.  </P> <P> Rose has consistently denied betting on baseball or on his own team -- offenses  punishable by banishment from the game under baseball rules.  </P></p>

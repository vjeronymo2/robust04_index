			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Milwaukee County submitted to the FAA on December 3, 1993, noise exposure maps, descriptions and other documentation which were produced during the FAR part 150 Noise Compatibility Study from September 1989 to December 1993. It was requested that the FAA review this material as the noise exposure maps, as described in section 103(a)(1) of the Act, and that the noise mitigation measures, to be implemented jointly by the airport and surrounding communities, be approved as a noise compatibility program under section 104(b) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has completed its review of the noise exposure maps and related descriptions submitted by Milwaukee County. The specific maps under consideration are the 1992 existing Noise Exposure Map and the 1997 future Noise Exposure Map. The FAA has determined that these maps for General Mitchell International Airport are in compliance with applicable requirements. This determination is effective on September 23, 1994. FAA's determination on an airport operator's noise exposure maps is limited to a finding that the maps were developed in accordance with the procedures contained in appendix A of FAR part 150. Such determinations does not constitute approval of the applicant's data, information or plans, or a commitment to approve a noise compatibility program or to fund the implementation of that program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If questions arise concerning the precise relationship of specific properties to noise exposure contours depicted on a noise exposure map submitted under section 103 of the Act, it should be noted that the FAA is not involved in any way in determining the relative locations of specific properties with regard to the depicted noise contours, or in interpreting the noise exposure maps to resolve questions concerning, for example, which properties should be covered by the provisions of section 107 of the Act. These functions are inseparable from the ultimate land use control and planning responsibilities of local government. These local responsibilities are not changed in any way under part 150 or through FAA's review of noise exposure maps. Therefore, the responsibility for the detail overlaying of noise exposure contours onto the map depicting properties on the surface rests exclusively with the airport operator who submitted those maps, or with those public agencies and planning agencies with which consultation is required under section 103 of the Act. The FAA has relied on the certification by the airport operator, under section 150.21 of FAR part 150, that the statutory required consultation has been accomplished. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has formally received the noise compatibility program for General Mitchell International Airport, also effective on September 23, 1994. Preliminary review of the submitted material indicates that it conforms to the requirements for the submittal of noise compatability programs, but that further review will be necessary prior to approval or disapproval of the program. The formal review period, limited by law to a maximum of 180 days, will be completed on or before March 22, 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA's detailed evaluation will be conducted under the provisions of 14 CFR part 150, section 150.33. The primary considerations in the evaluation process are whether the proposed measures may reduce the level of aviation safety, create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, or be reasonably consistent with obtaining the goal of reducing existing noncompatible land uses and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons are invited to comment on the proposed program with specific reference to these factors. All comments, other than those properly addressed to local land use authorities, will be considered by the FAA to the extent practicable. Copies of the noise exposure maps, the FAA's evaluation of the maps, and the proposed noise compatibility program are available for examination at the following locations: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Room 617, Washington, D.C. 20591 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Aviation Administration, Minneapolis Airports District Office, Room 102, 6020 28th Avenue South, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55450 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> General Mitchell International Airport, Administration Office, 5300 South Howell Avenue, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53207&hyph;6189 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chief Librarian, City of Oak Creek, 8620 South Howell Avenue, Oak Creek, Wisconsin 53154 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chief Librarian, City of St. Francis, 4235 South Nicholson Avenue, St. Francis, Wisconsin 53207 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chief Librarian, Tippecanoe Library, 3912 South Howell Avenue, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53207 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chief Librarian, City of Greenfield, 7215 West Coldspring Road, Greenfield, Wisconsin 53220 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chief Librarian, City of Franklin, 9229 West Loomis Road, Franklin, Wisconsin 53132 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chief Librarian, City of Cudahy, 4665 South Packard Avenue, Cudahy, Wisconsin 53110 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chief Librarian, City of Greendale, Village Hal, 5666 Broad Street, Greendale, Wisconsin 53219 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chief Librarian, City of South Milwaukee, 1907 10th Avenue, South Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53172 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Questions may be directed to the individual named above under the heading,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 --> Issued in Minneapolis, Minnesota, September 23, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=2 --> Franklin D.

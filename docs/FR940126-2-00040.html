			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (vi) For private voluntary organizations, have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> voluntary board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each LRO will be responsible for certifying in writing to the Local Board that it has read and agrees to abide by the cost eligibility and reporting standards of this publication and any other requirements made by the Local Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An LRO may  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  operate as a vendor for itself or other LROs except for the shared maintenance fee for food banks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) LROs selected for funding must:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Maintain records according to the guidelines set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forth in the manual. Consult the Local Board chair/staff on matters requiring interpretation or clarification prior to incurring an expense or entering into a contract. It is important to have a thorough understanding of these guidelines to avoid ineligible expenditures and consequent repayment of funds. LROs' questions can be answered by National Board staff at (703) 706&hyph;9660.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Provide services within the intent of the program. Funds are to be used to supplement and extend or initiate food and shelter services, not as a substitute for other program funds. LROs should take the most cost-effective approach in buying or leasing eligible items/services, and should limit purchases to essential items within the $300.00 limit for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment, unless prior approval has been granted by the National Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Deposit funds for this program in a federally insured bank account. Proper documentation must be maintained for all expenditures under this program according to the guidelines. Agencies should ensure that selected banks will return canceled checks. LROs' expenditures and documentation will be subject to review for program compliance by the Local Board, National Board or Federal authorities. Records must be maintained for three years and any interest income must be put back into program expenditures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) LRO Documentation of EFSP expenditures requires copies of canceled checks (both sides) and itemized vendor invoices. An acceptable invoice has the following characteristics:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) It must be vendor originated;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) It must have name of vendor;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) It must have name of purchaser;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) It must have date of purchase;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (E) It must be itemized; and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (F) It must have total cost of purchase.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All LROs will be required to periodically submit documentation to the National Board to ensure continued program compliance. Any LRO receiving over $100,000 in Federal funds must comply with the Single Audit Act, OMB Circular A&hyph;133.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) In addition to the aforementioned documentation, reports to the Local Board must be submitted by their due date. Interim report/second and third check request forms will be enclosed in the LROs' first check package. When the LRO is ready to request its second/third check it must complete and sign the interim report and forward it to the Local Board for its review and approval. The reverse side (second/third check request) should be completed by the Local Board chair and mailed to the National Board. LROs must complete all portions of the final report form, return two copies to the Local Board, including one copy of documentation if requested, and retain a copy for their records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) The LRO must work with the Local Board to quickly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clear up any problems related to compliance exception(s) at the end of the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vii) The LRO shall contact the Local Board regarding technical assistance, interpretation of guidelines, and resources from other Federal programs, such as U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) surplus food.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fiscal Agent/Fiscal Conduit Relationship <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) For National Board purposes, a fiscal agent/fiscal conduit is an agency that is serving as the mechanism for other agencies to benefit from EFSP funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The fiscal agent/fiscal conduit is the organization responsible for the receipt of funds, disbursement of funds to vendors, and documentation of funds received. The fiscal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agent/fiscal conduit must meet all of the requirements of an LRO.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Local Boards may wish to use a fiscal agent/fiscal conduit when they desire to fund an agency not having an adequate accounting system or not conducting an annual audit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Any agency benefitting from funds received by a fiscal agent/fiscal conduit must meet all of the criteria to be an LRO except the accounting system and annual audit requirements and sign the Fiscal Agent/Fiscal Conduit Relationship Certification Form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Fiscal agents/fiscal conduits may cut checks to vendors only. They may not cut checks to the agencies on whose behalf they are acting or to agencies/sites under their ``umbrella.'' The exception to this is when an agency is using the per diem allowance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Fiscal agents will be required to submit individual interim and final reports for each agency. Fiscal conduits will file a single interim report on their awards along with a breakdown of agencies and spending with the final report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Fiscal agents may not fund an LRO with an outstanding compliance exception. If a fiscal agent has an unresolved compliance exception, any other funds awarded to the fiscal agent will be held in escrow until all compliance exceptions are resolved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

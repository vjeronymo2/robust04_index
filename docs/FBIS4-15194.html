"The issue of deploying any Russian bases on the territory  of  Latvia was not raised and does not exist. The radar station in  Skrunda cannot be viewed as a military base. All issues  connected with the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia have  been solved in the Russian-Latvian agreement which has been  initialled", Kostikov said in a statement.    On Wednesday a document received by TASS from the  presidential administration said President Boris Yeltsin had  okayed the proposal of the Defence Ministry to have nearly 30  military bases in CIS countries and Latvia.    Kostikov said "explanations about a technical mistake, as a  result of which Latvia was mentioned in the wrong context, will  be provided by diplomatic channels".</p>

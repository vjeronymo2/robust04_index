			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Bank staff press for staged deal THE UNION representing most staff at Barclays Bank has asked the company to offer a staged pay deal after its members rejected an offer worth an average of 3 per cent. Under the proposal from Barclays Group Staff Union, the present offer would be implemented immediately and backdated to February, the settlement month. It wants a further rise to follow later in the year. The Barclays pay talks are among the first of the year in the financial-services sector, and negotiations are being watched closely by Midland and National Westminster banks and other companies in the sector. The offer is one of the lowest in the sector in recent years, and the Bifu financial services union, which also has members at Barclays, is advocating industrial action. The proposed deal will be compared with a settlement at Abbey National, another of the sector's pace-setters, under which salaries of 'effective performers' would be backdated to February 1 by 5.4 per cent. The Barclays offer, covering non-managerial staff, would lead to rises of between Pounds 230 and Pounds 535 a year. Unions estimate they are worth between 2.5 per cent and 4 per cent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 24 March Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of Keidanren [Japan  Federation of Economic Organizations], talked about economic  prospects at a news conference on 23 March. He indicated:  "While there are encouraging signs, my feeling is that economic  recovery will probably come by the end of this year or in  January 1995."    He also said: "There are still factors obstructing the  recovery." He cited the following factors: 1) Land  transactions remain stagnant, and the value of collateral  remains low; 2) as long as Japan has a huge trade surplus,  appreciation of the yen will continue; 3) corporate  restructuring, for instance, in terms of capital investment and  employment, has not been completed.    Hiraiwa further indicated a cautious view about talks on a  further economic plunge. He said: "In March last year, it was  said the recession had bottomed out, but there was a further dip  in the April-June period. I think the situation has improved  from last year, but we cannot yet say for sure the same thing  will not happen this year."    [In a related 450-character report carried in its 24 March  morning edition received via Nikkei Telecom Database, MAINICHI  SHIMBUN also reports: "Hiraiwa commented on the International  Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) nuclear inspections in North Korea  at the same 23 March news conference. He said: `There should  be several stages before imposing economic sanctions. As much  as possible, it is necessary not to carry out sanctions and  isolate North Korea.' He indicated that Japan should exert  efforts in that direction.    "Hiraiwa further stated: `The DPRK's isolation will  constitute a factor of uncertainty in world stability and peace.  Through its traditional contacts, Japan should work to help  North Korea adapt to the international community. At the same  time, North Korea should also exert efforts to adapt to the  international community.'    "Regarding economic sanctions, Hiraiwa said: `If that  becomes necessary, it would be advisable to cooperate with other  countries through the United Nations.'"]</p>

			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Trafalgar to launch third rights issue A NEED for yet more write-downs on its property portfolio will this morning lead Trafalgar House to announce a rights issue of up to Pounds 400m, its third cash call within two years. The construction and engineering group, in which the Jardine Matheson-controlled Hongkong Land has a 25 per cent stake, will also confirm that Mr Allan Gormly is to stand down as chief executive next August to become chairman of Royal Insurance. He will remain on Trafalgar's board. He will be replaced as chief executive by Mr Nigel Rich, managing director of Jardine Matheson in Hong Kong. The group's advisers, Robert Fleming and Schroders, have recommended that the group strengthen its balance sheet by asking its shareholders for money instead of making 'fire sale' disposals. Although Trafalgar still plans to sell its hotels, including the Ritz, it will do so when the market improves. The rights issue is needed because of further property write-downs and the equity requirements for its growing engineering and construction division. The group's net debt varies from Pounds 250m to Pounds 500m on a seasonal basis. Trafalgar had hoped to wait until mid-December when it will announce its full-year results to unveil its latest rights issue. But market speculation that it is planning to tap shareholders for cash forced it to bring forward its announcement to today. Shareholders may be weary at being asked for more finance for their loss-making company. But Trafalgar is expected to argue that its new board, including a new finance director, Mr David Gawler, from Jardine Matheson, believes the company is significantly undercapitalised for the level of its business.</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Hundreds wait to quit Yemen as fears grow that war will worsen Hundreds of foreign nationals awaiting immediate evacuation from Yemen gathered at Sanaa airport yesterday as fears grew that the civil war would soon engulf the entire country. Many Yemenis were fleeing the capital, loading up their possessions and heading for the comparative safety of the countryside. Northern leaders broadcast assurances that they had no intention of bombing the south. Military observers in Sanaa said yesterday that advances towards Aden from the north and east had been repelled by southern forces, but they could give no precise details of troop locations or of any further military movements. British, Chinese, French, Indian, Syrian and US citizens were among those flocking to Sanaa airport, while other groups were reported to be travelling by road to the Red Sea ports of Hodeidah and Mocha for evacuation by sea. British embassy officials, who are co-ordinating flights for their citizens, expected nearly 160 people of various nationalities to board two RAF Hercules. Earlier plans to send evacuees to Djibouti had to be cancelled because of growing congestion there, the officials said. Many shops in Sanaa were closed and queues of up to 200 vehicles waited at filling stations for the increasingly scarce supplies of petrol. Yemenis normally use some 65,000 barrels a day, mostly produced at the refinery in Aden. Fears among the northern population rose sharply following the explosion on Wednesday of a Scud missile launched by southern forces east of Sanaa. Some 23 people have been reported killed in the blast and many others injured. The target of the attack was apparently a nearby palace belonging to the northern leader, Gen Ali Abdullah Saleh. Officials in Sanaa claim that the south has now launched some 20 Scuds against targets in the north. Meeting defence officials, President Saleh accused his southern rivals of targeting civilians and vowed retaliation. He repeated his earlier calls for the southern leader, Mr Ali Salem al-Biedh, to surrender, saying that Mr al-Biedh and other southern leaders would receive fair trials.</p>

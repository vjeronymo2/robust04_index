			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> THREAT OF SUIT HALTS ANAHEIM SALE OF 'PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' TICKETS  </P> <P> The Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim halted ticket sales today for Ken Hill's "The  Phantom of the Opera" after a threat of legal action by the producers, who have  claimed that the sales are unauthorized.  </P> <P> Yale Gutnick, attorney for the Phantom Touring Co., said the theater had done  "a substantial amount" of business in advance ticket sales. "We don't know how  many tickets they've sold because we are not getting good information from  them," Gutnick said from his office in Pittsburgh, Pa., "but our conservative  guesstimate is in the neighborhood of $100,000 at least."  </P> <P> Celebrity Theatre officials have failed to respond to repeated inquiries from  The Times.  </P> <P> The theater has been advertising a December engagement of the show -- a version  of the "Phantom" that inspired Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical -- for several  months without authorization, Gutnick said. He was scheduled to speak with  theater officials today and said he would demand that ticket purchases be  refunded.  </P> <P> Klaus Kolmar, the New York booking agent for the show's upcoming national tour,  said Wednesday that the theater had been negotiating for the show but had not  completed a contract. He said the producers required a deposit in the "low five  figures" but that the theater "never deposited two cents."  </P></p>

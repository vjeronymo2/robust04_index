According to a communique issued  this week by CONACOPP coordinator Cherestal Vanes, he had  decided to expel Saurel Beaujour from the confederation because  of a lack of harmony between Beaujour and the other members of  the organization.    Beaujour in turn accuses Vanes of depositing a check for  $600  in his personal account. This Indian wrestling match is taking a  new turn.    The latest note from CONACOPP, dated 29 December, signed by  nine members of the organization's national secretariat,  formally denied the letter from Cherestal Vanes, who had  personally made the decision to expel Saurel Beaujour. The  communique says that the CONACOPP national secretariat was never  aware of the facts mentioned in Vanes' letter. The secretariat  asserts that Saurel Beaujour has always had exemplary behavior  within the organization, which has not been true of Cherestal  Vanes. The secretariat also took this opportunity to announce to  the national and international organizations that Cherestal  Vanes is no longer CONACOPP spokesman.</p>

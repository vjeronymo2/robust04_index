			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> MARLA LIFTS PRIMETIME RATINGS  </P> <P> The appearance of Marla Maples -- the former girlfriend of Donald Trump -- on  "PrimeTime Live" Thursday night turned out to be something of a ratings  success.  </P> <P> The interview, by ABC'S Diane Sawyer, wound up with a 14.2 national Nielsen  rating and a 25% audience share.  </P> <P> That's the highest ever for the program -- the previous best was a 12.6  rating-22% share on Oct. 19 following the San Francisco earthquake -- and it  enabled "PrimeTime Live" to win the 10-to-11 time period for the first time.  </P> <P> Maples' appearance in the last half hour of the program jumped "PrimeTime's"  ratings in New York, where she has been in tabloid heaven for weeks, to a  23.4-37 from a 21.3-31 in the first 30 minutes.  </P></p>

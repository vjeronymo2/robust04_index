			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: CBS man tipped for NBC after rigged truck report NBC NEWS is expected to name CBS News producer Mr Andrew Lack as president in an effort to restore its tarnished reputation after the rigging of a broadcast test of a General Motors truck last year. There has been widespread speculation about who will head the news division since March, when the third-ranking television network announced the resignation of the division's president, Mr Michael Gartner. Mr Lack appeared to be the front-runner yesterday. Mr Lack, 45, who has been at CBS News for 16 years, was named executive producer of CBS's prime-time news magazine show, Street Stories, this year. He also produces specials and is credited with reviving CBS's documentaries with a string of successes, including Malcolm X: The Real Story, Remember Pearl Harbor and Watergate: The Secret Story. NBC, a unit of General Electric, had to apologise on air after it showed pictures of a blazing GM truck without telling viewers that incendiary devices had been attached to make the truck burst into flames in a collision.</p>

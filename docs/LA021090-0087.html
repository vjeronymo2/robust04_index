			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PALMDALE MAY TRY TO TURN VACANT PENNEY'S STORE INTO LIBRARY  </P> <P> The old J.C. Penney building in downtown Palmdale, due to be vacated this fall  when the store moves to a new regional mall, could be renovated into an  expanded city library by early next year under a plan adopted this week by the  City Council.  </P> <P> City officials plan to open negotiations to buy or lease the 32-year-old  building from its owner, a partnership headed by Reseda businessman Melvyn  Starkman. The Penney's building would nearly triple the space of the city's now  13-year-old library.  </P> <P> For several years, the city had been planning to renovate and expand the  12,000-square-foot library at 700 E. Palmdale Blvd. to meet the demands of a  growing population. But city officials recently dropped those plans after bids  for the project came back in excess of $600,000.  </P> <P> For that price, the Spanish-style library would have been expanded by only  3,000 square feet. City officials have estimated that the cost of upgrading  Penney's building, which has 31,000 square, at $775,000, not including purchase  or lease costs.  </P> <P> "I'm excited about the prospect if we are able to follow through on this," said  Linda Storsteen, Palmdale city librarian. She said the Penney building is large  enough, just a few blocks from the current library in a central location and  has ample parking.  </P> <P> Even so, city officials acknowledged, they have yet to closely inspect the  building, which is at 38548 Sierra Highway. Although it does have fire  sprinklers, city officials said, the possibility of asbestos removal and  structural upgrades could substantially increase the cost.  </P> <P> Storsteen called it "the only building big enough in town to really service our  needs." The librarian said she had been thinking of the building as a potential  library well before the J.C. Penney Co. announced plans to move into the  Antelope Valley Mall, which is under construction.  </P> <P> The current library, near City Hall and the first building built by the city,  would be converted to some other municipal use, Storsteen said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Salvador, Brazil, 11 May (PL) -- Cuban President  Fidel Castro arrived today in this northeastern Brazilian city  during a service stopover on his return flight from South Africa  to Cuba.    The Cuban president visited Pretoria, the South African  capital, where he participated in the inauguration of President  Nelson Mandela.    The Cubana de Aviacion flight landed at the Dos de Julio Air  Base in the capital of Bahia state, where Fidel Castro and his  entourage were greeted by current Governor Antonio Imbassahy,  former governor Carlos Magalhaes, Ramon Sanchez Parodi, the  Cuban ambassador to Brazil, and other local personalities.    This is the second time the Cuban president has visited  Salvador and the fourth time he has visited Brazil.    Fidel visited Brasilia in early 1990 for the presidential  inauguration that year. In June 1992 he attended the world  summit on the environment in Rio de Janeiro, and in July 1993 he  visited Salvador Bahia to participate in the third  Ibero-American conference.    According to official sources cited by the local press, the  Cuban president will remain approximately 12 hours in Brazilian  territory, although no official agenda was announced for his  visit.    Organizations of friendship and solidarity with Cuba as well  as other associations in Bahia said they wanted to give Fidel  Castro a great reception.</p>

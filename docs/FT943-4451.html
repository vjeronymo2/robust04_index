			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Technical trading ahead of next Friday's expiry of the September FT-SE 100 Index futures contract dominated an otherwise steady day of consolidation that gave some relief from the nervousness seen on Tuesday, writes Clare Gascoigne. Volume in the September contract was significant at 19,160 lots, but it was the December contract that saw the greatest change in turnover. Volume was more than doubled to 9,826, compared with only 4,072 the previous day, as traders began to roll over positions from the September to December contracts. September opened steadily at 3,213, but then moved up rapidly to 3,227 by mid-morning, the high for the day. However, a slow drift down began soon after, and the contract closed at 3,206 - spot on its fair value premium to the underlying cash market of 3 points. Once again, 3,200 proved the testing ground; the September contract touched its lowest point at this level and traded under 3,210 for most of the day. Volume was also high in traded options, with total turnover reaching 39,939 lots, of which 10,898 were in the FT-SE 100 option. The most actively traded stock options were British Steel at 2,750 contracts and HSBC at 2,068.</p>

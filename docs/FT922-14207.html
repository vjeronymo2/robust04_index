			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Election '92: Labour seeks to mine a rich seam in Notts - The coal industry's future is the key issue THE grey-green slag heaps on either side of the M42 between Birmingham and Nottingham defy the best technologies in environmental improvement and soil recovery. The rounded humps and their threadbare carpet of grass are all that remains of north Staffordshire's mining industry. To the east are Nottinghamshire's 12 remaining pits and the headquarters of the union that sealed the fate of Britain's last great union battle. The stance taken by the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, which broke away from the National Union of Mineworkers in defiance of Mr Arthur Scargill's strike-call in 1984, caused bitter divisions in the mining communities. Eight years on, a much slimmer industry is fighting for its future. The mining card should help ensure that Labour extends its tiny majority in Mansfield and could bring it success in neighbouring Sherwood, a seat that covers a cluster of mining villages north of Nottingham. Almost everyone in the Sherwood villages, it seems, is a miner or former miner. Every broad hand holds a record of social history among the faded callouses. In many parts of this Tory marginal, however, candidates are just as likely to find that the strong handshake is that of a farmer. The rich coal seams underground give way to the ploughshare on the surface in an agricultural landscape dotted with modern pitheads. Mr Andy Stewart, the popular sitting Tory MP and a local farmer, put in some astute groundwork in touring the pits earlier this year. He faced tough questioning from mineworkers and managers, worried that imported coal or gas-fired power stations, or both, would kill what was left of their industry. He earned much respect, but whether he earned their votes is another question. 'Some miners must have voted Conservative at the last election, but it's difficult working out who they were,' says Mr Peter Short, the UDM branch secretary at Bilsthorpe colliery and a Labour party worker. Over at Rainworth Miners' Welfare Club, Mr Brian Vout, UDM secretary at nearby Rufford pit, agrees, but blames Labour's failure to recognise the UDM for many of the party's lost votes in north Nottinghamshire at the 1987 general election. Two of the UDM's four full-time officials, Mr Neil Greatrex and Mr Mick Stephens, are committed Labour supporters. Mr Greatrex says he has a promise from Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's energy spokesman, that a Labour government would not restrict the union's rights to represent miners. Dissatisfaction with Labour remains, but it is difficult to gauge its depth. Mr Vout applauds Mr Stewart's pit visits and criticises the failure of Mr Paddy Tipping, the Labour candidate, to do the same at Rufford. 'I haven't seen Tipping here,' he says. 'I always vote Labour, of course, but I would appreciate listening to what the man has to say.' Conversation with miners inevitably drifts towards the price of coal and the willingness of the electricity generating industry to use it. Mr Stewart has rehearsed his election spiel, celebrating the rejection of a coal import terminal at Immingham on the River Humber and pointing to recent pronouncements by Mr John Wakeham, the energy secretary, that gas should not be used for electricity generation where it is more expensive than coal. Mr Stewart points out that only 6,500 of his constituents work in the mines. Some 8,000 others are retired miners with different problems that he argues would be better served by a Conservative government. But the Labour tradition runs deep, supporting the belief that Mr Stewart's increased majority in 1987 was due to resentment towards Labour in the aftermath of the strike. Life without mining became a reality for Mr Tony Calladine, who left Bilsthorpe because of ill-health just after the 1985 strike. He set up a business restoring and servicing veteran motorcycles. It has branched out in to polishing and chroming car engines displayed at motor shows. Eight years of enterprise culture have not changed his voting patterns, however. 'I have always voted Labour. I just think they are a better party.' Come polling day, the closet Tories may re-emerge. Mr Stewart knows he commands a healthy personal vote, but in the end it may not be enough.</p>

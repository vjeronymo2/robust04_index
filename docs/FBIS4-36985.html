			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says Israel is waiting  for PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat to assume control in Gaza and  Jericho before it continues negotiations with the PLO. The  prime minister spoke at a news conference in Haifa last night.  Sylvia Leaf reports:    [Begin recording] [Leaf] Yasir 'Arafat will be allowed to  enter Gaza and Jericho whenever he wishes, Prime Minister Rabin  told reporters, but he must also assume responsibility over the  Palestinian authorities.    [Rabin] At this stage, I am focusing to see how the PLO,  through the Palestinian Authority, succeed to take over and to  control, in accordance to their commitment to us on the DOP  [Document of Principles] and the Cairo agreement, to fulfill  their parts. Before that, I will not pass any judgment.    [Leaf] Regarding a peace agreement with Syria, the prime  minister said the Syrians believe that America can influence  Israel against her will, and this attitude won't succeed. He  stressed that solutions can be found only when agreed upon by  both Israel and Syria.    The prime minister said the recent closure of the  territories  to Arab workers has resulted in the employment of a further  25,000 Israelis in the building industry. Justifying his  authorization of work permits for 25,000 Palestinians from the  territories, Rabin pointed out that in the past year, no  terrorist attacks have been carried out in Israel by  Palestinians permitted to work here.

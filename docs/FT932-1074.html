			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Patten row over leaked plan for school premises MR JOHN PATTEN, the education secretary, was yesterday at the centre of a fresh political row after leaked ministerial correspondence revealed a cabinet split over plans to scrap 'inessential' regulations covering school premises in England and Wales. The correspondence, leaked by Labour, indicates senior ministers do not all agree with Mr Patten's proposals to deregulate quantity and quality standards for school playing fields. The plans also call for the abandonment of some rules governing teaching space standards. The letters pinpoint Mr Peter Brooke, heritage secretary, as the chief cabinet dissenter on the grounds that a 'less prescriptive' approach would be better than 'complete abandonment of any standards.' Warning Mr Patten not to underestimate the 'flak' the measure would attract, Mr Brooke said deregulation was likely to be seen by the 'playing field lobby' as 'a cost saving device, with potentially disastrous results for team games and for the ability to deliver the PE requirements of the National Curriculum.' Without the reference point provided by minimum standards, 'it is difficult to see how you will be able to judge whether the school playing field space is adequate or not in considering any application to dispose of such land,' Mr Brooke said. Deregulation would also 'add to the lobby mounted following the winding up of the Play Unit that this government does not take children's play sufficiently seriously.' Mr David Hunt, the former Welsh secretary, warned that the issue was a 'sensitive' one 'which will need careful presentation.' On balance, however, he supported the idea. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, urged that the 'benefit' of deregulation be extended 'in practice' to independent schools. In a letter to Mr Hunt, Mr Patten said the regulations were being reviewed because the 'costs of compliance go well beyond any realistic prospect of the capital expenditure which is likely to be made available for improving existing buildings.' 'Almost any outcome is bound to become controversial. But we now need to grasp the nettle,' he said. Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, accused Mr Patten of showing 'total contempt' for the concerns of parents, governors, teachers and pupils. Mr Patten had admitted the 'Conservative policy of allowing the fabric of our schools to crumble has been a disaster,' she said.</p>

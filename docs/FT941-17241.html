			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / International Company News: Bristol Myers unveils shake-up Bristol Myers Squibb has announced an overhaul of its operations and extensive job losses. It joins a growing list of US drug groups working to adapt to changes in pharmaceuticals markets around the world. Some 5,000 jobs will be shed over the next two years, out of a total of 51,000, many of them through a restructuring of the group's sales and marketing operations in the US and Europe. The company has been slower than other US pharmaceuticals groups to cut costs and focus its sales and marketing operations on managed care buyers in the US. Managed care groups, which buy in bulk, now account for a large part of total drug purchasers and have forced drug groups to discount heavily. As part of the restructuring announced yesterday, Bristol Myers said the US sales force would be reorganised into 12 regional groups, backed up be a strengthened managed care group and marketing staff. The company said it was removing a layer of management in Europe, and that its 11 business units on the continent would report directly to a European headquarters rather than through four regional divisions. These changes would reduce staff in the pharmaceuticals business around the world by 3,000 in all, the company said.</p>

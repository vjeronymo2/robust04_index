The report by these two organizations says that although  safety requirements to avoid AIDS contamination have increased,  the situation is still devastating.    Officials from the Attorney General's Office and from the  Health Department said that 72 blood banks -- of the 278 in  Colombia -- lack scientific controls to ensure that their blood  is not contaminated, and 195 blood banks do not fully comply  with the scientific and administrative requirements established  by law.    Of the 278 blood banks, 32 conduct no serological tests for  the HIV virus (AIDS); 50 conduct no tests for hepatitis B, 150  do not test for hepatitis C, and five do not test for syphilis.    Moreover, only three blood banks have an operating license.  In Antioquia 24 blood banks do not comply with the licensing  requirement; in Atlantico, 13; in Bolivar, eight; Boyaca, 32;  Cundinamarca, 39; Caldas, four; Caqueta, eight; Cordoba, 13;  Huila, five; Magdalena, 13; Narino, six; Norte de Santander, 14;  Santander, 27; Tolima, 13; and Valle del Cauca, 22.    In the departments of Boyaca, Cundinamarca, Magdalena,  Putumayo, Santander, and Sucre, the health centers that store  blood supplies do not have adequate technical equipment for  preserving and processing blood.    Another defect the investigators found is insufficient care  in handling the blood donors' medical record. This document is  used to evaluate the health status of anyone who gives blood.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Professor Virgil Magureanu, director of the </F> Romanian Intelligence Service, by Ileana Lucaciu in Bucharest on  28 May: "Old Mentalities Are an Obstacle"]    [Text]  <H5>  The Living Standard Determines the Overall Image of a Regime </H5>   [Lucaciu] Law No. 14 of 24 February 1992 on the organization  and functioning of the Romanian Intelligence Service [SRI]  defines the main role of this institution as follows: A state  body specialized in gathering intelligence about Romania's  national security. At your last news conference on 29 March,  you said that the main threat to national security is the  situation of the economy. Would you be so kind as to elaborate  on this statement?    [Magureanu] I am not the best authorized person to give you  an answer to that question and to corroborate the negative  impact that the precarious state of the economy can have on our  national security. It is more than obvious that there is no  sphere of social life that is not affected by the state of the  economy. First of all, the state of a country's economy is at  the basis of social stability. In its turn, social stability is  linked to the living standard, that is, to the well-being or  poverty level of certain social strata, which can lead to  discontent and tension. Some of these manifestations of  discontent and tension can degenerate into extreme outbursts. I  believe that you remember the regrettable phenomena in the life  of our young democratic society, which were also caused by  economic discontent. I would cite the last miners' incursion as  an example of such a phenomenon. These are extreme situations.  However, there are also other aspects, less visible at first  glance, which are also correlated to the state of the economy.  When the economy is in crisis, these aspects -- upon which our  national security depends to a high degree -- cannot be  satisfied, such as the national defense and the working out of a  system whereby Romania can assert its interests, as a function  of the geopolitical context in which we find ourselves. But  then, regardless of what I said, the overall image of a regime  is usually linked to the people's living standard, which cannot  conceivably be ensured at a reasonable level without a dynamic  economy boasting positive growth quotas.    [Lucaciu] Within the framework of its obligations, the SRI  puts together various assessments and information on certain  states of affairs, which it then submits to the authorized  bodies: the government, presidency, and the Parliament. Even  you confirmed that you have produced such information during  certain situations. What was the efficiency of these  assessments, as reflected in the concrete actions taken by the  respective bodies, which represent the power?    [Magureanu] Indeed, we regularly brief the respective  bodies, even on a daily basis. You ask me about the efficiency  of this information? Well, it varies somewhat. Anyhow, the  majority of our briefings have an impact at the executive level,  where measures are taken to counter would-be negative phenomena.  There are also moments when we make concrete proposals for  various negative situations that arise, situations that require  urgent measures to solve the problems.    [Lucaciu] To give a concrete example, I would recall that  you notified the relevant bodies in connection with the  Petromin-Forum Maritime contract [irregular sale of Romanian  vessels to Greek ship owners]. As a matter of fact, the press  has published similar revelations, too. Nevertheless, the  contract could only be stopped by the justice bodies.    [Magureanu] Generally speaking, we are also concerned, like  you are, with the negative situation of our fleet after 1990.  We issued various warnings in this respect and, indeed, certain  things were subsequently redressed. We cannot judge now whether  adequate measures were rapidly taken at the time. However, I  believe that our information has had an impact. But what is  regrettable is the fact that all the people who could have  played a positive role in solving these matters of utmost  importance -- such as the aforementioned case -- have failed to  act in a concerted manner. Their efforts were disparate at  times. On other occasions, the problems were tackled from a  partisan political angle. Several sequences of the  Petromin-Forum Maritime affair were turned into political  accusations against one another, which somewhat distorted the  core of the matter. Thus, it became a political dispute, when  it actually was a serious national matter, which should have  been coherently tackled from the same position by all sides  involved.    [Lucaciu] In such a situation, one must show some  understanding for political passions specific to this period and  perhaps to the temperament of some people, even though they may  harm the final goal.    [Magureanu] In our society's evolution, it is somehow normal  that the two of us, for instance, should be situated at  different political positions. However, when strategic matters  are at stake, which are most important for the national security  -- the fleet is also such a matter, since it is directly or  indirectly linked to our national security -- we should give up  our partisan political attitudes. Political differences should  only account for nuances, if they are properly conceived and  brought up in the respective case. On the contrary, if the  situation is seen from antagonistic positions by the sides  involved -- for the sole reason that there are political  differences between them -- then the solution to the problem  will be further delayed. However, the dispute around the  Petromin-Forum Maritime acquired an unprecedented virulence,  hence the lower efficiency in solving the case due to the  various partisan attitudes that have hampered the solving of a  serious affair for our society.    [Lucaciu] Partisan positions are currently manifest in the  parliamentary commissions, which examine and then submit reports  on various matters. As a rule, two reports are drawn up: one  for those in power and the other for the opposition. This is  now happening in the Anti-Corruption Commission, which cannot  submit its report on time, at the scheduled date of 30 May.    [Magureanu] My opinion is that when the problem of  corruption at various levels is raised -- unfortunately we are  often compelled to acknowledge the existence of this phenomenon  -- political passions should be set aside and the law should be  allowed to have its say. The relevant factors should help the  law in this respect. But maybe even we, as an institution, have  not been doing a proper job in this respect, to the extent of  supplementing the efforts made by others to clarify various  cases. Maybe the rather poor correlation between us and the  mass-media is also to be blamed for this, since we should really  support each other.  <H5>  Caritas -- A Negative Phenomenon of Great Proportions </H5>   [Lucaciu] You told the press that you notified the relevant  authorities some time ago about the danger posed by Caritas and  the other so-called mutual assistance games. However, these  schemes unfolded at will, until they went bankrupt, thus hurting  thousands of poor and naive people, while enriching a few  profiteers.    [Magureanu] From the beginning, Caritas should have been  restrained by special legislation, which would have prevented  the game from unfolding. I have stated my opinion on this  subject in public on several occasions and I also took up the  matter with various officials. Caritas was a negative  phenomenon of great proportions, which not only swindled some  poor people out of large sums of money, but also extracted huge  sums of money from the overall economic circuit. At a certain  point, the experts even feared a serious economic blockage --  there was indeed such a possibility -- due to the draining away  and piling up of huge sums of money blocked in these games. To  all this, one should add the artificial price hikes in the areas  whether the Caritas profits had an impact and the dollars taken  outside the country, after being bought at absolutely incredible  prices, which were three or four times higher than the official  rate. All this is the negative and very serious outcome of the  Caritas scheme.    [Lucaciu] Therefore, you informed the relevant people. Why  did nobody take the necessary steps on time? It seems that  there is a crack along the three-stage route of information, the  power's analysis forum, and the decisionmaking process. An  interested or disinterested crack...    [Magureanu] There was a delay in the decisionmaking process  in this particular case. Here, we may both agree on the  implications of the problem. There has been much interference,  at various levels. There was local pressure from those who  could earn money from such schemes. There was pressure from  certain people at various levels of power, who were given  priority in receiving money from the game. Then, there was also  pressure from the public at large. At a time of economic crisis  -- here we return to the issue of the economic crisis, a problem  that burdens us all -- people believe in miracles. There is a  paradox with regard to miracles, namely that the less likely  they are, the more people tend to believe in them and the  greater their resonance. We witnessed the functioning of the  miracle of general prosperity, at a time of crisis, when hopes  in a better life could no longer be perceived in a normal way.  To all this, one has to add the slow pace at which the legal  bodies moved in this matter. We do not yet have a settled  legislative system. In a healthy economy, the games of chance  are strictly regulated and are not allowed to acquire such scope  and what a newspaper called "such caricature-like proportions,"  as occurred in our country.    [Lucaciu] I asked you this question about the route of your  information and its efficiency, because I could find no  stipulation in Law No. 14 that you can legally notify someone --  the justice bodies, for instance -- to rapidly intervene in such  a serious case unearthed by the SRI.    [Magureanu] Indeed, the law does not specify that. However,  we are entitled to legally intervene whenever we can perceive a  major attempt to undermine our economic life. We not only have  the right, but also the specific duty to intervene in such  situations.    [Lucaciu] What form does your intervention take?    [Magureanu] We issue warnings about the major danger posed  by certain actions.    [Lucaciu] Who are you warning, the justice or the General  Magistracy?    [Magureanu] Yes.    [Lucaciu] What if the Magistracy or the law do not take any  measures?    [Magureanu] Well, you had better address this question to  the respective institutions. However, I believe that we should  also be more efficient in issuing appropriate warnings in such  cases.    [Lucaciu] The SRI is an institution that is subordinated  to Parliament and its activity is organized and coordinated by  the Supreme Defense Council of the Country, which is headed by  President Ion Iliescu. In what way are you subordinated to the  aforementioned council?    [Magureanu] All our principal domains of activity are  controlled by Parliament. However, as far as the day-to-day  executive aspect of our activity is concerned, as well as the  way in which we integrate ourselves within the framework of  other institutions that by law are part of our security system,  we are subordinated to the Supreme Council. We are to  periodically report our activity to the council. Summarizing  the whole thing, fundamentally we are under the control of  Parliament, but in our current activity we are subordinated to  the Supreme Council.    [Lucaciu] Besides the SRI, which other services work  parallel to you in Romania?    [Magureanu] There have been a great number of allegations  about those services. They have been enumerated and everyone  considered that there are too many of them. However, the  services operating outside the SRI are actually branch services  [servicii sectoriale]. For instance, there is a  counterintelligence protection unit functioning within the  Ministry of Interior (UM 0215). Or the Guard and Protocol  Service of the dignitaries (SPP) [Serviciul de Protectie si  Paza], which for its current information has set up a so-called  Center for Operational Information. And, as in all countries of  the world, the Armed Forces have their own military  counterespionage and information protection service. The  competence of all these services is limited to their specific  field of activity. And as you may know, there is also the  Foreign Intelligence Service (SIE).    [Lucaciu] Does the SRI cooperate with these services?    [Magureanu] Yes, we do. Our day-to-day activity presupposes  our cooperation with those services, in a way that is strictly  regulated by law.    [Lucaciu] Under whose control are those services?    [Magureanu] Here there is a special situation. Whereas we  are effectively under the control of Parliament, they are  subordinated, as stipulated by law and other precise  regulations, to the institutions to which they belong: To the  respective ministries, or, in other cases, such as the SPP, to  the corresponding institution.    [Lucaciu] The law stipulates that one of your duties is to  protect state secrets and prevent the leaking of information.    [Magureanu] In every intelligence service the protection of  secrets features within the spectrum of its activity. Since our  work in this area can be characterized as general, it is only  natural that we should also have broad responsibilities  regarding the protection of state secrets.    [Lucaciu] You have personally admitted that there have been  some cases of information being leaked to the press from the SRI  itself. What steps have you taken to curb that phenomenon?    [Magureanu] I did not exclude the possibility of information  being leaked to the press. But not just "to a certain part of  the press" [reference to alleged leak of information about a  number of opposition leaders and other politicians to the  Greater Romania Party weekly ROMANIA MARE]. Some leaking of  information did occur, it is true, but it was not deliberate in  all cases. Sometimes it happened because some of our employees  did not act correctly; we immediately took measures against them.    [Lucaciu] I understand that the SRI has reached the third  phase in its reorganization, which has been done by  restructuring in the name of the professionalism required by the  specific exigency in such services. There has been a great deal  of speculation in the press on this issue. In some cases even  linking the restructuring to the areas where they took place  [reference to replacement of SRI heads in various counties].    [Magureanu] Restructuring has not been carried out in  special areas. During the third, current, phase, we submitted  the command to restructuring. I would define the essence of the  current phase as follows: The transfer of the command over to  the young generation. To a very significant percentage we have  made that transfer to the new generation. In the future that  transfer will amplify within our institution so that the command  should be, to an ever-increasing extent, in the hands of the  young people who joined the SRI after 1990. For the present,  this process has just begun, but we made the transfer to put the  command in the hands of a generation that, above all, has a  better perception of the current role of our institution and of  our fundamental goals. Please note that such restructuring did  not occur merely in some areas of the territory, but rather over  the whole of it. Over one-third of the command of our county  branches, as well as in our central units has been revitalized  since last autumn.    [Lucaciu] Article 4 of Bill No. 14 stipulates that upon  request of the leaders of public institutions, public  corporations, and so on, the SRI is allowed to disclose  information about persons who are to be appointed in important  offices in the said units. Did the presidency contact you in  this regard, requesting that you disclose such information about  the persons who were to be appointed presidential counselors?    [Magureanu] Yes, they requested it in quite a number of  cases. But not in all cases. I would like to emphasize the fact  that the law gives us the right to do that solely upon the  request of leaders of institutions. This clause has been  introduced deliberately. Thus we should offer objective  information about the character, about the aptitude of the  persons who are to be appointed to certain offices. In some  cases they request such information. In certain cases they do  not. Actually no institution leader is compelled to request  such information, especially if he considers that he already has  sufficient information about the person in question. At the  time they discussed this law, the aforementioned paragraph was  the subject of lengthy negotiations. I always stress this fact.  Initially, that paragraph sounded much more imperative, as it  stipulated that institution leaders are compelled to consult  with us. That is when I also took the floor and I said that I  do not wish our institution to mediate or to be responsible in  any way for the appointments made in leading offices, as this  would resemble the previous practice, generate suspicion, and it  would artificially act as arbitration, which is not necessary.    [Lucaciu] Bill No. 14 also stipulates that the SRI organize  and carry out the transportation of official mail over the whole  territory of Romania, in order to protect the state secrets.    [Magureanu] This refers to secret mail, which it is our duty  to transport.    [Lucaciu] You are aware of the fact that recently a top  secret document, which had been elaborated by presidential  counselor Colonel General Vasile Ionel and confidentially sent  to Radu Timofte, the chairman of the Senate Defense Commission,  was also published, partially, by the weekly ROMANIA MARE. The  information contained in that document, once published, may  affect national security. How would you term this situation?    [Magureanu] That was a leaking of information caused by the  incorrect conduct of an employee.    [Lucaciu] There are several plausible variants...    [Magureanu] I know the dispute and I do not believe that  things are as simple as they seem at first glance. I do not  think that one of the persons at the two ends -- Messrs. Vasile  Ionel and Radu Timofte -- are responsible for it, but rather the  blame should fall on the incorrect action of the intermediary  who transported the mail.    [Lucaciu] Will you ever be able to present the truth about  this case to the public?    [Magureanu] If they request that we should interfere in this  case, which does not directly refer to us...    [Lucaciu] But is the surveillance of secret correspondence  not one of your tasks?    [Magureanu] The leaking did not occur during the  transportation of the mail. Owing to the strict transportation  regulations we have, such a thing would have been impossible.    [Lucaciu] Does the publishing of that document infringe upon  national security?    [Magureanu] Of course it can affect national security.    [Lucaciu] And, under such circumstances, will you intercede?    [Magureanu] Yes, if we are requested to do so, because we  were not involved in this matter and I am not sure whether the  mail in question was part of the correspondence for which we  normally ensure the transportation.    [Lucaciu] During a news conference you asserted that the  level of your cooperation with similar bodies in the Republic of  Moldova was not very good.    [Magureanu] No, it was not.    [Lucaciu] How is it currently?    [Magureanu] It still isn't.    [Lucaciu] Certain analysts claim that if one were to  simplify things, currently there is an underground struggle  going on in our country between two wings of the former  Securitate. One consists of those who are nostalgic, while the  other, those who are pragmatic, who adapted to the market  economy, and support the reform. What is your opinion on such  allegations?    [Magureanu] I think that such reasoning is a little  artificial. I did not really understand your assertion about  the former Securitate. These old structures no longer exist in  our country.    [Lucaciu] I was not referring to structures, but rather to  people.    [Magureanu] Those people retired a long time ago. It is  true, some of them went into business, so that remark was  correct. However, I would not consider them as champions of the  reform. Similarly, I would not consider that the other ones, the  structured [structurati] ones -- as you termed them -- within  the former Securitate, exert a genuine, palpable, influence upon  our security system. There are no such influences.    [Lucaciu] I did not mean especially the SRI, but rather  their influence upon our political life.    [Magureanu] I do not believe there is such an impact, except  perhaps to an extent that I would term as marginal; certain  employees of the former Securitate have been called upon to  carry out certain operations, let us say, professional ones, by  certain political parties. However, in my opinion such cases  are not very significant.    [Lucaciu] Do you think that those persons have altered their  outlook?    [Magureanu] To a varying degree, from case to case.    [Lucaciu] Do you not think that the inability to change  certain conceptions is hindering the reform process?    [Magureanu] Of course, old conceptions, regardless of the  domain in which they manifest themselves, act as hurdles.  However, I do not think that it would be conclusive if one  claimed that certain hindering actions could, to a relevant  extent, be exerted by former employees of the Securitate. In my  opinion, in our case conservatism may be traced back to  completely different things. I would like to warn everyone of  this potential error that comes of looking at things  schematically. It is not a certain part of the former  Securitate acting to hinder reform, while another part of the  same echelons of the Securitate acts in favor of reform. I  think this image is an artificial one. But we could talk in  detail about this subject some other time.    [Lucaciu] Many people endorse this idea by the manifold  underground ties the former Securitate people had.    [Magureanu] One oversimplifies things if one considers all  hindering actions -- which are really there, one can feel them  in Romanian society -- as the work of some former Securitate  employees with old conceptions. The image of our current  situation is much more complex.    [Lucaciu] Which are the factors, in your opinion, that cause  such visible hindering effects?    [Magureanu] There are very many of them. For instance, at  the local level and in the central administration there are  certain corrupt or corruptible persons, who are interested in  keeping their current advantageous positions and therefore their  actions cannot be but hindering, going against the tide.    [Lucaciu] If one looks at reality, our current situation,  there seems to be quite a number of persons interested in going  against the tide.    [Magureanu] Again, one has to distinguish among things.  Hindering actions cannot be explained solely by the existence of  old conceptions and corruption. Such actions may also be the  consequence of certain inadequate juridical regulations,  loopholes in the organization, the wrong assessment of the steps  that ought to be made in certain directions, and the unsuitable  nature of the development programs at various levels.    [Lucaciu] I would like to mention the fact that I did not  discuss all these issues with the acting director of the SRI,  but rather with a person who is interested in political  expertise. Do you intend to go into politics when you retire  from the SRI?    [Magureanu] That is an issue that will have to be decided in  the future, and in any case not in the near future. What I  intend to do is go back to my former work, that is, education  and research. However, other routes cannot be excluded either.  As far as the future is concerned, I consider myself a person  who still has sufficient time ahead of him, so there is still  some uncertainty about my future options.    [Lucaciu] As a person who is interested in the political  domain, do you believe that currently in Romania there are  clearly structured political doctrines?    [Magureanu] No. And that is another reason for the  continuing stagnation and hesitation. Although various parts of  our political spectrum have been claiming their own doctrines,  these have still not sufficiently jelled. Some of them have not  even been adapted to the general European course either, despite  claims that their ideologies stem from broader currents existing  in Europe. There is discrepancy between the doctrines they  claim to follow and the similar doctrines as practiced in the  neighboring countries and, generally, in Europe. Besides, the  level of our political culture is quite low. Unfortunately,  this phenomenon is quite obvious. I have had the opportunity to  see with my own eyes, even during public debates, persons who  claimed they were followers of a certain current, a certain  doctrine, and yet they were not familiar with its canons.  Besides, there is also a kind of a circumstantial behavior,  meaning that whenever they find a slogan that is useful for the  purpose of their immediate political profit, they will not  hesitate to adopt it, without pondering and trying to analyze it  deeply first. A great deal of confusion is also generated by  the very large number of political parties that currently exist,  some of which -- and quite a number of which -- claim they  belong to social- democracy or some other contemporary doctrine,  without sufficient knowledge about those currents and without  being able to explain either the Romanian tradition in the  evolution of those doctrines or the way in which they evolved in  Europe and in the world. All this sometimes generates a bleary  situation with respect to the relation between those doctrines  and reality in our country.    [Lucaciu] The absence of well-established doctrines leads to  the personalization of our political life, to the accentuation  of the role of the leaders. What importance would you ascribe  to leaders in the life and representation of political parties?    [Magureanu] If one thinks in terms of what is specifically  Romanian, one sees that this influence is palpably very strong.  It is true, the phenomenon of personalization -- the  personalization of power, one might say -- in the life of  political parties and even generally in politics, may appear in  the initial phase of democracy, but it may continue later on as  well. However, in the two aforementioned cases the quality of  the personalization is essentially different. In the case of  our country, in the initial phase, within many of the political  parties the leaders had an overwhelming role in the shaping of  those currents, in their gaining credibility and even  legitimacy. This is a fact that is valid not only for Romanian  society, but for other societies as well. I mean the other  societies, which similarly to us, are also in the transition  phase. It seems inherent to me that personalities should play  such a role in the initial phase of democracy. In some cases it  may even have beneficial effects.    [Lucaciu] Under the current circumstances do you believe  early elections could be held?    [Magureanu] This is possible.    [Lucaciu] Considering that the various doctrines are not  clarified yet, how do you think the electorate could find its  way about?    [Magureanu] The electoral options will be significantly  reoriented. This is a normal phenomenon during the transition  period. Today we have reached a further phase of reform. Let  us not forget, Romania has made significant steps on the way of  transition, and, although for some people those steps proved to  be quite painful, their results are irreversible. This is also  acknowledged by certain international bodies. From now on, the  crucial issue for us is whether or not we manage economically.  Our performance in solving that issue will be decisive for the  option of the electorate.    [Lucaciu] Is economic success not the result of strategies?    [Magureanu] Yes, obviously.    [Lucaciu] That strategy is offered by the parties designated  by the electorate.    [Magureanu] As far as the shaping of strategies is  concerned, responsibility is shared by all those who, at a given  time, share the state power.    [Lucaciu] Do you anticipate a positive outcome?    [Magureanu] I refrain from making forecasts. But if I were  to do so, I should be moderately optimistic, while, in any case,  manifesting restraint. If I were to make an assertion now, it  could be superseded by the dynamic evolution of events and,  besides, any clear-cut assertion of mine might be interpreted as  an attempt to meddle in the normal course of political life.    [Lucaciu] Before the end of last month you held a meeting  with the editors in chief of various dailies intended to better  the circulation of information between the SRI and the press.  What have you accomplished so far in that sense and what has  the press accomplished?    [Magureanu] We are trying to refine our relations with the  press through the press office, which we have improved both in  structure and function. Moreover, we are trying to make our  relations with the press more fluent in the case of issues of  general interest. Those are issues that are equally interesting  for both parties and which we could make joint efforts in  clarifying.</p>

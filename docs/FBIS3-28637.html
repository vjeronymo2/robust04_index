The North  Koreans are paying special attention to making a large  waterproof glass coffin which will preserve Kim's body in the  hall's mausoleum, he added. The glass coffin will be 10 meters  long and 10 meters wide, and kept in an underground mausoleum 30  meters deep for permanent preservation of Kim's body, which will  automatically rise to the ground for public displays.    To prevent the body from decaying, the coffin will be placed  five to six meters from the walls of the mausoleum, the source  said. In October last year, eight North Koreans secretly  visited Beijing to meet five Chinese technicians who took part  in making the glass coffin for the late Mao Zedong.    North Korea is using Chokwang Trading Co. in Macao, one of  its foreign trade bases in Asia, to procure the materials needed  in the mausoleum and glass coffin such as wood, special steel  plates, copper pipes and marble, he said. Last October and in  early February, Korea Taesong Trading Co., one of North Korea's  leading trading houses in Pyongyang, contacted a building  supplies firm in Hong kong while opening a letter of credit for  300,000 U.S. dollars to purchase the materials, he added.    Negotiations with the Hong Kong firm are proceeding smoothly  and if its initial shipment to the port of Hungnam in North  Korea is successful, there will be second and third shipments  from the firm, he said.</p>

			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> I'm amazed that people are asking me if Pat Riley was a good coach. . . .  </P> <P> The answer: Four NBA championships in nine seasons, seven Western Conference  championships, a record 102 playoff victories, a record .733 regular-season  winning percentage. . . .  </P> <P> Sure, he coached immensely talented teams. For eight of his nine seasons, he  had both Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. But a lot of coaches wouldn't  have been able to harness those egos or would have cramped their styles. . . .  </P> <P> Riley got out of Magic, Kareem, James Worthy and Byron Scott what director  Francis Ford Coppola got out of Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro and  Robert Duvall in the first two "Godfather" movies. . . .  </P> <P> "Anybody can coach ordinary players and get them to overachieve," a prominent  college basketball coach told me recently. "It's much tougher to work well with  stars. Riley did a remarkable job." . . .  </P> <P> Riley didn't win any popularity contests with his players, but neither did John  Wooden, Vince Lombardi or Casey Stengel. I mean, did Lombardi ever do lunch  with Max McGee? . . .  </P> <P> Under Riley, the Lakers accomplished what had been considered impossible in Los  Angeles. A recent Times poll showed that more people cared about them than the  Dodgers. . . .  </P> <P> So why the departure now? Nine years is long enough. People get on other  people's nerves. Who knows, Coppola might not direct "Godfather X." . . .  </P> <P> At 45, Riley is only three years younger than Red Auerbach was when he moved  upstairs to the general manager's job at Boston after the 1965-66 season. . . .  </P> <P> Riley was merely Chick Hearn's yes man when he did color on the Laker  broadcasts, but was exceptional as host of the recent HBO special, "The History  of the NBA," and would figure to work well with either Marv Albert or Bob  Costas at NBC. . . .  </P> <P> NBC is going to televise Magic's annual summer benefit game at the Forum. What  better way for Riley to debut? . . .  </P> <P> I trust that Jerry West is as good a judge of young coaches as he is players  and that he has made a wise choice in Mike Dunleavy. . . .  </P> <P> Better an eager guy with excellent credentials as an assistant than some  retread. . . .  </P> <P> Dunleavy gave all the right answers at the Riley-out, Dunleavy-in press  conference Monday at the Forum and was poised for somebody who hadn't been  through this kind of thing before. . . ..  </P> <P> The first proper move he can make is to keep assistant coaches Bill Bertka and  Randy Pfund. . . .  </P> <P> Clearly, Dunleavy's challenge is enormous. Trades, perhaps a free-agent signing  and the maturing of Vlade Divac could make the Lakers a better team than last  season, when they had the best regular-season record in the league. But nobody  will be able to dominate the Western Conference in the 1990s as the Lakers in  the '80s because the competition is so much better now. . . .  </P> <P> Magic as player-coach was a lousy idea. He's got enough to do on the court. . .  .  </P> <P> Look-alikes: Dunleavy and Billy Cunningham. . . .  </P> <P> The Detroit Pistons never were more convincing than on Sunday, when they beat  the Trail Blazers by 15 in Portland without the services of Dennis Rodman. . .  .  </P> <P> I could have sworn Steve Wynn's $32-million purse bid for the cooled-off Buster  Douglas-Evander Holyfield fight was a mirage. . . .  </P> <P> Bill Shoemaker, Tony Gwynn, Charles Smith, the Loyola Marymount basketball  team, Don Drysdale, Jim Hill and the late Gene Klein will be honored Saturday  night at the annual Cedars-Sinai Sports Spectacular at the Century Plaza. . . .  </P> <P> Chris Evert was the better tennis player, but Mary Carillo is the better tennis  commentator. . . .  </P> <P> Jerry Tarkanian, who has never lost a game in Long Beach, will coach a team of  celebrities against the Los Angeles Rams in a benefit for the Oralingua School  for the Hearing Impaired Friday night at Cal State Long Beach. . . .  </P> <P> I've seen quicker knockouts, but never a quicker cut than Paul Gonzales  received 30 seconds into his International Boxing Federation bantamweight title  bout against Orlando Canizales Sunday in El Paso. . . .  </P> <P> What Paul has to do now to get another title shot is become more active.  Sixteen fights in six years aren't enough. . . .  </P> <P> It's time for lightweight Todd Foster, who has 12 knockouts in 12 fights since  the 1988 Olympic Games, to step up in class. . . .  </P> <P> Joe Carter is making San Diego's trade with Cleveland look good. . . .  </P> <P> Would Roger Clemens have clunked Stanley Jefferson on the elbow if American  League pitchers still batted and were personally subject to retaliation?  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>   [Text] Australia's defense links with Jakarta are now just  as important as those with Washington. That is the conclusion  to be drawn from the first strategic review of Australia's  defense priorities since the end of the Cold War. The  unclassified version of the report clearly locks Australia's  military needs into Asia, particularly Southeast Asia. And it  also identifies China as possibly having major security  implications for the region. John Shuvlan spoke to the  Australian defense minister, Robert Ray.    [Begin recording] [Ray] Well, I think they are both equally  important. Clearly Indonesia is the key country in our  particular region. We are delighted at the extent we have been  able to reestablish with them our defense links since setbacks  in 1986. It's been a very smooth transition from the past  somewhat brittleness into a very durable relationship.    [Shuvlan] We still see or we see now our relationship with  the U.S. virtually in Asian terms, don't we? If it is good for  Asia, then it is okay.    [Ray] Fairly much so, but it is not the only aspect of our  relationship with the United States that is important. We have  a very strong relationship on the intelligence side, on  equipment purchases, on technological transfer. They have been  very good to us in the last few years when we wanted to acquire  different defense platforms, enormously cooperative as seen even  recently through two or three second hand buys where we have  been given the first choice of equipment.    [Shuvlan] So, they are not really, though, as I think  Menzies may have have put it years ago our great and powerful  friend anymore.    [Ray] Oh certainly over five decades the relationship  changes. But there are less bilateral issues between us now,  actually, to disturb the relationship than has been in the last  50 years.    [Shuvlan] The other emerging great player in terms of a  military might is China. How concerned are we about China's  military future?    [Ray] Well, certainly, the Chinese defense force are going  through a substantial upgrade and modernization and a lot of  that is to do with the fact that they have got a fairly archaic  structure. But clearly, as an economic power, they are going to,  if they continue at the current rates of economic growth, be a  very powerful force.    At the moment, however, you have to distinguish between  capability and intent and they are showing no intent in fact of  misbehaving in the region. It is a matter that is probably of  more concern to some of our neighbors than to us directly  because of the historic nature of the Chinese relationship in  the region.    [Shuvlan] So, let us say for example, the Indonesian  archipelago is something almost like a bulwark between Australia  and China.    [Ray] Well, I don't see it in those direct terms, but  clearly Indonesia, if it is a friend and we are engaged in a  strategic partnership with them, is very much Australia's  frontline defense. Someone else will have to defeat Indonesia  first. But this strategic review is not looking toward an  immediate threats emerging. Just to the long view that we  should try to establish as good relationship as we can with the  various countries of our region.    [Shuvlan] So it would take a some kind of a rogue regime in  Beijing for the major security implications that you talked  about in the report to take effect?    [Ray] Well, I am not going to target any particular regime  in any particular country. No strategic review does that, at  least not in the declassified version. But I have to say that,  you know, just developing this not just bilateral relationships  but good relationships in the region very much promotes our own  security. [end recording]</p>

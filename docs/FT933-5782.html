			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourse activity recovers as UK investors return THE RETURN of the UK investor gave activity a boost, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT hit a new three-year high as the DAX index rose 23.00 to 1,944.89; but it lost some of its gains in the afternoon, the Ibis-indicated DAX closing at 1,931.95. Turnover rose from DM5.8bn to DM11bn. Ms Barbara Altmann, at B Metzler in Frankfurt, said that equities had risen on the strong domestic bond market, where the average bond yield fell by another 5 basis points yesterday to 6.05 per cent. Deutsche Bank reflected bond market gains as it rose DM16 to DM795, although it fell back to DM788.50 after hours. In the construction area, a buying order for Bilfinger &amp; Berger pushed it DM42 higher to DM960, and Heidelberger Zement rose DM55 to DM1,115. Meanwhile, the market punished disappointing results. Hoechst, marginally below par on Monday, fell another DM1.30 to DM278.80 while BASF and Bayer rose by DM4.10 to DM257.90, and DM5.50 to DM301.40 respectively. Other names in the sin bin included Varta, the battery maker, Linotype, the printing machinery maker, and Karstadt, the stores group. PARIS peaked again as the CAC-40 index improved 10.82 to 2,216.49, off the day's high of 2,222.87. Turnover was strong at FFr4.7bn, after Monday's low FFr2.7bn. The expiry of August futures and options was a contributory factor to the market's gains, while optimism about imminent domestic interest rate cuts, possibly during this week, also lifted shares. Elf Aquitaine was one of the few stocks to go against the trend, closing off FFr2.70 at FFr445.90 after a fall of nearly 60 per cent in first half profits. The oil group included a FFr2.3bn write down of oil assets because of the weakness in international oil markets. In contrast Elf Sanofi, in pharmaceuticals, added FFr11 to FFr1,009 after satisfactory first half figures while BSN picked up FFr25 to FFr952, recovering all the ground it had lost at the end of last week because of alleged problems with glass bottles made by its Dutch subsidiary. MADRID tried to blast its way into new high ground, but the gains did not hold and the general index closed 1.76 lower on the day at 303.12, after 309.06 at midsession. Turnover was strong at Pta38.38bn. The afternoon was not enhanced by a New York downgrade of Repsol by Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette, which removed the American Depositary Receipts from its recommended list. In Madrid, the shares fell Pta140 to Pta3,880. ZURICH said that the CS Holding results were in line with expectations as the bearers eased SFr5 to SFr2,950; the SMI index rose 7.1 to 2,488.1. However the telecommunications equipment manufacturer, Ascom, accelerated its downtrend. Down SFr70 on Monday ahead of a first half loss, it dropped another SFr110 to SFr1,140 after an early plunge in the shares led to a temporary suspension of trading. AMSTERDAM maintained its forward momentum, with a rise in the CBS Tendency index of 1.5 or 1.1 per cent to 131.4. The market's rise was mainly concentrated in the morning session, with some profit-taking evident in the afternoon. A firm bond market also supported equities, while technical factors assisted the rise in some stocks, notably Unilever, which put on Fl 6.50 or 3.3 per cent, to Fl 203.90, mostly on short-covering. Traders at Amsterdam brokers Pierson also noted switching out of cyclicals into defensive stocks, such as Unilever, and commented that the overall market was now looking overbought; a technical correction was now both logical and healthy, they added. MILAN retreated a little in a technical correction from recent high levels. The Comit index finished down 1.02 at 631.84. The construction and cement sectors remained active following the untying of bottlenecks in public works projects by the government last week: Italmobiliare rose L96 to L46,276. COPENHAGEN featured gains of DKr10 to DKr130 in East Asiatic on a turnround prediction, and of DKr16 to DKr480 in Sophus Berendsen B after Monday's higher profits. The KFX index, unruffled by the state 1994 draft budget, gained a marginal 0.12 to 97.88. VIENNA saw OMV fall Sch15 to Sch798 ahead of a statement by the oil group on its interim figures which are due to be announced next week. OMV said that it saw little change in its financial situation, having reported a first half loss in 1992. The ATX index rose 6.33 to 1,014.08. TEL AVIV added another 2.4 per cent to Monday's gain of 1.1 per cent in reaction to political developments in the region and the cabinet's approval of the budget. The Mishtanim index rose 5.01 to 208.76 in turnover of Shk244m.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices August 31 THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Open    10.30     11.00    12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1322.48  1323.18   1322.46  1322.58 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1402.64  1400.36   1400.03  1400.19                         13.00    14.00     15.00    Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1324.11  1324.34   1320.51  1319.96 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1402.09  1401.81   1397.80  1396.45  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Aug 27    Aug 26    Aug 25    Aug 24    Aug 23 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1308.15   1298.46   1310.93   1296.82   1291.83 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1397.66   1384.05   1385.62   1375.46   1374.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1325.96; 200 - 1403.35 Low/day: 100 - 1319.78 200 - 1394.83.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

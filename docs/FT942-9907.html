			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Imports from EU fall to a three-year low Imports from the European Union into the UK fell to their lowest level for almost three years in February, amid the continuing recession in western Europe, seasonally adjusted trade figures from the Central Statistical Office showed yesterday. The value of imports from EU countries to the UK fell to Pounds 5.1bn during February, down from Pounds 5.4bn the previous month. Coupled with fairly flat levels of UK exports to the EU, the fall in imports meant that the UK's trade deficit with the rest of the EU also fell in February, down to Pounds 74m from Pounds 97m the previous month. This was its lowest level for five months, and markedly lower than the UK's trade deficit with the rest of the world. Part of the reason for the improvement in the EU trade balance was that imports from Germany fell for the fifth consecutive month in February, dropping to Pounds 1.48bn - leaving the trade deficit with Germany narrower at Pounds 226m. The trade deficit with France was also lower in February, down to Pounds 91m from one of Pounds 137m - again largely due to falling imports. Meanwhile, yearly figures show that the UK ran a trade surplus with the Benelux countries for the second year in succession. The UK's trade deficit with non-EU countries slightly dipped in February, after rising earlier in the year. The trade balance with the US fell to a deficit of Pounds 12m, compared with a surplus of Pounds 38m in January. On a three-monthly basis, however, the balance showed a growing trade deficit with the US, with one of Pounds 145m during the three months to February, compared with Pounds 4m during the previous three-month period.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------    TRADE WITH COUNTRIES INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE EU BALANCE OF PAYMENTS                    BASIS (POUNDS M SEASONALLY ADJUSTED)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                        Exports                                     Countries                       European       outside       Whole                         Union        the EU        world  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1992                   60,365         46,682      107,047 1993                   63,510         57,329      120,839 Q1                     16,324         13,569       29,893 Q2                     15,502         14,158       29,660 Q3                     16,188         14,441       30,629 Q4                     15,496         15,161       30,657 Aug                     5,622          4,835       10,457 Sept                    5,412          4,811       10,223 Oct                     5,216          5,251       10,467 Nov                     5,173          4,853       10,026 Dec                     5,107          5,057       10,164 1994 Jan                     5,328          5,065       10,393 Feb                     5,035          5,173       10,208 Mar                                    5,035  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                        Imports                                     Countries                       European       outside       Whole                         Union        the EU        world  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1992                   64,022         56,431      120,453 1993                   67,730         66,789      134,519 Q1                     16,772         16,716       33,488 Q2                     16,681         16,309       32,990 Q3                     16,924         16,881       33,805 Q4                     17,353         16,883       34,236 Aug                     5,367          5,477       10,844 Sept                    5,885          5,755       11,640 Oct                     5,784          5,594       11,378 Nov                     5,697          5,585       11,282 Dec                     5,872          5,704       11,576 1994 Jan                     5,425          5,848       11,273 Feb                     5,109          5,830       10,939 Mar                                    5,753  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                    Visible balance                             Countries               European       outside     Whole    invisibles   Current                Union         the EU      world     balance     balance  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1992          -3,657         -9,749    -13,406       3,439      -9,967 1993          -4,220         -9,460    -13,680       2,753     -10,927 Q1              -488         -3,147     -3,595         217      -3,378 Q2            -1,179         -2,151     -3,330          34      -3,296 Q3              -736         -2,440     -3,176       1,260      -1,916 Q4            -1,857         -1,722     -3,579       1,242      -2,337 Aug              255           -642       -387 Sept            -473           -944     -1,417 Oct             -568           -343       -911 Nov             -524           -732     -1,256 Dec             -765           -647     -1,412 1994 Jan              -97           -783       -880 Feb              -74           -657       -731 Mar                            -718  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source CSO  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

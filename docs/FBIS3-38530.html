The Community delegation  is led by Mr. Benavides (DG I, External Relations) and the  Russian delegation is led by Mr. Ivanov (Vice-President of the  Russian Agency for International Cooperation). After a month  and a half of reduced activities for reasons both political  (government reshuffling in Russia after the December elections,  time for reflection by the Twelve on the results of the talks  obtained at the time of President Yeltsin's visit to Brussels on  9 December) and substantive (compromise solutions for the  outstanding problems were to be examined by both sides), on  Wednesday and Thursday the EC and Russian negotiators are  essentially examining the three principal outstanding problems,  namely:     -  The nuclear sector, especially rules and provisions  governing trade in enriched uranium between the EC and  Russia;    -  The opening of the Russian banking sector to foreign  banks. Russia insists on transitional limited access to its  financial market, but apparently could be satisfied with a sort  of "voluntary limitation" by the EC;    -  Maritime transport.</p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PHILIPPINES AS REAL-LIFE SITCOM: DEALING WITH COUPS AND THEIR MAKERS  </P> <P> Watching events unfold in the Philippines is like watching a never-ending  political sitcom. Last December a coup attempt left a lasting image of  President Corazon Aquino besieged yet again by rightist rebels, while crowds  hooted and cheered like basketball fans. "Surrender or die!" she said. But the  rebels retreated, after signaling a timeout. A prominent opposition senator  arrested for rebellion and murder becomes a star. Up north, a  torturer-turned-renegade-leader runs circles around government troops.  </P> <P> Much of this would be laughable if it weren't for the tragic consequences. And  it shows Aquino's brand of leadership struggling to stay just ahead of anarchy.  </P> <P> The arrest Feb. 27 of the leading opposition figure, Juan Ponce Enrile, on  charges that he assisted the recent coup, should have been welcomed by a public  long critical of Aquino's indecisiveness in times of crisis. But the way it was  mishandled -- and Enrile's subsequent release on bail -- highlight the kind of  muddling-through that best describes Aquino's four years in power.  </P> <P> There isn't much so far to suggest that the president's emerging "get-tough"  image is anchored on solid footing. Nor is it clear that Enrile's arrest forms  part of a program to deal with the highly politicized, faction-ridden military  once and for all.  </P> <P> Aquino has faced six coup attempts by rightist elements, the last two the most  serious. There could be more before her term ends in 1992. Rebel leader  Gregorio (Gringo) Honasan and his cohorts remain at large, despite increased  bounties for their capture.  </P> <P> Even if she survives more plots to overthrow her, Aquino has a tough role to  play, while wily, ambitious politicians like Enrile and her estranged cousin,  Eduardo (Danding) Cojuangco, are ready to exploit her weaknesses.  </P> <P> Although Enrile's arrest has not, by itself, provoked yet another coup attempt,  it triggered a bizarre sideshow in the north that resulted in the death of a  popular general and several others. Rodolfo Aguinaldo, the suspended governor  of Cagayan province, was also charged with aiding the attempted coup, but his  refusal to submit to an arrest warrant led to an unnecessarily bloody  shoot-out.  </P> <P> The Philippines is full of cult figures like Aguinaldo who live on the fringes  of the law. He was a military torturer under the late President Ferdinand E.  Marcos and a warlord and folk hero to hundreds of poor and hungry followers.  Until things got out of hand last week, Aguinaldo was allowed to defy both  military and civilian authority for years. He threw in his support for the  Reform the Armed Forces Movement (RAM) that helped depose Marcos. During the  unsuccessful coup of August, 1987, he took over military headquarters at the  provincial capital and flew the Philippine flag upside down.  </P> <P> The brutal shooting of Brig. Gen. Oscar Florendo, the armed forces' principal  spokesman, has helped turn public sentiment against characters like Aguinaldo.  Last December there was public indifference, even sympathy, for rebel soldiers  who were portrayed as "idealists" or "reformists." But Aquino's government  hardly benefits if rogues like Aguinaldo can roam about freely.  </P> <P> Jailing Enrile, the sole opposition senator, was the first such move against  any prominent personality accused by Aquino of supporting December's failed  coup. Along with Enrile -- a patron of the fugitive Honasan and of the "RAM  boys," as the military rebels are known -- Aquino has also named Vice President  Salvador Laurel and Cojuangco for possible complicity in the rebellion.  </P> <P> "It's a show of strength, but it could be a sign of weakness," said one Western  diplomat.  </P> <P> Two days earlier, Aquino marked the fourth anniversary of the "People Power"  uprising with an embittered attack against Enrile, who earlier "apologized" to  the Filipino people for having helped put Aquino in power. The unforgiving  president, speaking in colloquial Filipino, harangued Enrile for "revising"  history.  </P> <P> Until a Supreme Court ruling last week, Enrile was detained without bail under  a charge of rebellion with murder, although a 1956 Supreme Court ruling held  that the two offenses cannot be incorporated into one. If found guilty, Enrile  could face life imprisonment.  </P> <P> A former investigating officer recommended to state prosecutors that Enrile be  charged with the lesser offense of "disloyalty in times of peace," since it  would be easier to prove. This is a bailable offense, punishable by up to 10  years' imprisonment.  </P> <P> The charge sheets against Enrile so far are based largely on testimony by  waiters who say that Enrile entertained Honasan and about 100 rebels at his  residence on the first day of the coup.  </P> <P> If the aim of strategists in Malacanang, the presidential palace, was to  humiliate Enrile, it obviously backfired. The former defense minister basks in  the limelight of publicity. His arrest on the floor of the Senate left the  skillful lawyer-politician ample room for grandstanding. He gave an emotional  "farewell speech" to his colleagues while the arresting officer waited outside.  He held press conferences. His custodians made the further mistake of giving  him VIP treatment with amenities -- unrestricted visitors and access to media,  including a live telephone hook-up with a TV talk show.  </P> <P> Enrile could parlay all this into a presidential candidacy for 1992, if he is  cleared of charges. Though he was defense minister and the hated martial-law  administrator under Marcos, people here have short memories and tend to forgive  a man when he's down, or when he treats his friends well. On his birthday last  Feb. 14, Enrile gave a huge "coup" theme party with hundreds of guest turning  out in designer combat gear.  </P> <P> Another contender for the 1992 race could be Aquino's estranged vice president,  Laurel. The president has said Laurel is under investigation in connection with  the failed coup, but the government may move more cautiously in his case. He  was out of the country at the time, and the government would be loath to allow  him the kind of podium that Enrile's arrest has provided. Manila pundits regard  Laurel as a political lightweight.  </P> <P> Cojuangco is potentially the most formidable dark horse, but he remains tainted  as a Marcos loyalist and crony capitalist. Aquino's government has charged that  Cojuangco provided material and financial support to the rebels.  </P> <P> If the government means what it says, it must continue to move against its  perceived enemies. To ease up, to continue meting out the equivalent of  push-ups as punishment for mutineers, only invites more of the same.  Considering how close the last attempts came, the next one might well succeed.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> MILLER AT ROYCE HALL: A PERSONAL VISION OF POSTMODERNISM  </P> <P> Bebe Miller's best dances are at once physically engulfing and layered with  insights: social portraits defined through the relationships between dancers.  </P> <P> Her style proves distinctly contemporary in its incorporation of everything  from gymnastically daring contact improvisation to pedestrian motion to the  disarmingly elegant pointed toe. The attack remains propulsive and nonstop --  but the issues in question emerge in high relief.  </P> <P> In "Allies," introduced locally on Friday at Royce Hall, UCLA, Miller suggests  a more hopeful view of human contact than in "The Hell Dances," her  full-evening study of incompatibility. Here, all the shifting linkups between  individuals, the confrontations and manipulations, result in bonding.  </P> <P> There are trios exploring contrasting male and female energies (and don't  assume that the women come off looking lyrical). There's a romantic duet  between Renee Lemiux and Jeremy Weichsel that begins in secret -- behind one of  Robert Flynt's three billboard-size paintings on gauze -- but grows strong  enough to survive inspection by the others. And there's a final statement of  solidarity in which group acceptance becomes total, unthinking and a kind of  armor.  </P> <P> A throbbing score by Fred Frith helps sustain the pressure, but the investment  of Miller's six-member cast makes her meanings explicit. As they ricochet from  one intense, intimate encounter to another, these artists show how all  relationships -- between friends, family, workers no less than between lovers  -- reflect the same needs and strategies.  </P> <P> In its antic standoffs and cozy images of togetherness (including, midway  through, a company dress code), the familiar "Thick Sleep" offers a  dream-reflection/reduction of the themes shaping "Allies." This time, however,  the vocabulary stays gestural, the phrases brief and blunt, the emphasis upon  playful discontinuity: body-squiggles of great difficulty (sometimes) but  limited long-term satisfaction.  </P> <P> Lenny Pickett's blaring score and the costumes of Amy Downs (patches of color  over black) brighten this scherzo to near-florescence but the cast's dynamism  looks impersonal. Indeed, with its focus upon spatial/movement/costume design,  "Thick Sleep" doesn't really need people; its bold, flat imagery and clever  switcheroos would lose nothing in an animated cartoon.  </P> <P> Completing the program, Miller's solo "Rain" finds her on or near a central  platform of green turf, expressing her connection to the earth as an act of  discovery. The isolation of the patch of green in an otherwise empty, dark  space heightens the strangeness of the solo -- as does the lush, crimson gown  that Miller wears. We are seeing someone coming to terms with realities  understood but never experienced: an encounter full of tension and longing.  </P> <P> Although arguably too small in scale for Royce Hall, "Rain" potently reaffirms  several primal tenets in modern dance: the floor as the cradle of movement,  personal growth as the essential subject of choreography.  </P> <P> San DIEGO PERFORMANCE: Bebe Miller &amp; Company will perform Friday and  Saturday at the EducationalCultural Complex, sponsored by Sushi Performance  Gallery.  </P></p>

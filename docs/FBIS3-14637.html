			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sufyan Abu-Zayidah, "a Fatah leader in the </F> Gaza Strip" by Hasan Abu-Zayid, place and date not given; from  the "With the Events" feature]    [Text] [Abu-Zayid] Sufyan Abu-Zayidah, Fatah leader in the  Gaza Strip, what do you have to say about what happened in  Jabalyah yesterday?    [Abu-Zayidah] First, this is a very serious incident. It is  an unforgivable act by the Israeli undercover units. To  cold-bloodedly kill six Palestinians, six Fatah members, in  broad daylight is an extremely dangerous thing.    [Abu-Zayid] But, the Israelis; that is, the military  authorities have claimed that they were armed and masked.    [Abu-Zayidah] This is nothing new. The appearance of masked  men on the Palestinian streets has become a familiar phenomenon.  The same goes for carrying arms. This is no reason to kill  them. If the Israeli authorities want to kill whoever uses a  mask or carries arms, this means that they will kill hundreds of  Palestinians every day. I do not think that this would be a  reasonable thing to do.    [Abu-Zayid] Sufyan Abu-Zayidah: How does the typical  Palestinian view current developments, particularly at this  point in time when Israel and the PLO are attempting to resume  their talks?    [Abu-Zayidah] The entire Palestinian people are deeply  saddened and pained. They are shedding tears of blood on their  martyrs. At present, they cannot conceive of negotiations or a  peace agreement, of a resumption of the negotiations, or of a  halt to them.    [Abu-Zayid] Have you submitted your recommendations to the  PLO with regard to resuming or halting the negotiations?    [Abu-Zayidah] The Palestinian leadership is fully aware of  even the most minute developments here. In light of these  developments, the proper decision that will promote the  Palestinian people's interests will be made.    [Abu-Zayid] Has there been a retreat in the Palestinian  people's support for the peace process?    [Abu-Zayidah] The Palestinian people have not thus far seen  any tangible result, even a modest one, from the peace process.  On the contrary, since the convening of the Madrid conference,  they have seen calamities. It goes without saying that this is  bound to influence their convictions. Certainly, this latest  incident will not help strengthen the Palestinian people's  convictions regarding peace. Nonetheless, the Palestinian  people hope that the Israeli Army will withdraw from the  occupied territories so that peace may prevail in the region.    [Abu-Zayid] Notwithstanding these incidents, do you expect  progress in the peace talks at present?    [Abu-Zayidah] The natural outcome of this incident should be  the immediate withdrawal of the Israeli Army from Gaza Strip in  general, and from Jabalyah Camp in particular.    [Abu-Zayid] Sufyan Abu-Zayidah, Fatah leader in Gaza Strip,  thank you very much.    [Abu-Zayidah] You are welcome.</p>

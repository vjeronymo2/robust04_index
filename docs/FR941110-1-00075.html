			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, any proposed application for an essential use would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be evaluated based on the social utility of that application, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> availability of substitutes, and the potential for meeting that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need through banked or recycled controlled substances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Decision IV/25 also set out the procedural steps for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementing this process. It first calls for individual Parties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to nominate essential uses. These nominations are then to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluated by the Protocol's Technology and Economic Assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Panel (TEAP or the Panel) which makes recommendations to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representatives of all Protocol Parties. The final decision on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which nominations are to be approved is to be taken by a meeting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The initial cycle of implementing this Decision has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completed in the context of halons which were phased out of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production at the end of 1993. EPA issued a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice requesting nominations for essential uses of halons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (February 2, 1993; 58 FR 6786). In response, the Agency received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over ten nominations, but was able to work with applicants to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolve their near-term requirements. As a result, the U.S. did  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not nominate any uses for continued halon production in 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> About a dozen other nations put forth nominations which were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviewed by the Technical and Economics Assessment Panel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the Panel determined that in each case alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existed or that the existing supply of banked halons was adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to meet near-term needs, it did not recommend approval of any of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the nominations. In November of 1993, at the Fifth Meeting, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Parties unanimously adopted the recommendation of the Panel not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to approve any essential uses for the production or consumption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of halons in 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA issued a second notice for essential use nominations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for halons on October 18, 1993 (58 FR 53722). These nominations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered possible production of halons in 1995 for essential uses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to this inquiry, EPA received no nominations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Only one nomination (from France) was received by the TEAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for production and consumption of halons for an essential use in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1995. The TEAP did not recommend approval of this nomination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also issued a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice requesting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nominations for essential use applications which would need to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue beyond the 1996 phaseout of consumption and production  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowances for CFCs, methyl chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hydrobromofluorocarbons (May 20, 1993, 58 FR 29410). EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received 20 applications in response to this notice. For several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of these applications, EPA determined that the criteria contained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Decision had not been satisfied. For example, two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications sought CFCs for servicing existing air-conditioning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment. EPA rejected these applications on the basis that if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all economically feasible steps were taken prior to the 1996  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> phaseout, then adequate supplies of banked and recycled CFCs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be available. However, in rejecting these nominations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the United States noted that servicing existing air-conditioning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and refrigeration remains a major challenge to the successful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transition from the use of CFCs and that a future nomination in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this area might be necessary if a combination of retrofits,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacements, recycling, recovery at disposal, and banking do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequately address these needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the responses to the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  request for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> essential use applications, the United States submitted essential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use nominations to the Protocol for the following uses of CFCs:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> metered dose inhalers and other selected medical applications; a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bonding agent for the Space Shuttle; aerosol wasp killers;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited use in a specified bonding agent and polymer application;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and a generic application for laboratory uses under specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limitations. (Letter from Pomerance to UNEP, September 27, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nominations from the U.S. and other countries for over 200  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific uses were submitted to the Montreal Protocol Secretariat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and provided to the Technical and Economics Assessment Panel for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review. In March 1994, the Panel issued the ``1994 Report of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technology and Economic Assessment Panel.'' The Report includes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Panel's recommendations for essential-use production and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption exemptions. The Panel recommended that essential use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exemptions be granted for nominations of: methyl chloroform in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solvent bonding of the Space Shuttle; CFCs used in metered dose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inhalers; and specific controlled substances needed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratory and analytical applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For each of the other nominations submitted, the Panel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined that one or more of the criteria for evaluating an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> essential use had not been satisfied. For example, in the case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of several of the U.S. nominations, the report states that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternatives are available and therefore the essential use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exemption is not warranted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

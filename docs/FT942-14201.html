			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Arts: The ordure of the day - Cinema BEYOND BEDLAM (18) Vadim Jean PAINTED HEART (15) Michael Taav BACK IN THE USSR (15)Dean Sarafian SONATINE Takeshi Kitano The question of the week, if the nightmare sequences in Beyond Bedlam have not confused me, is 'where is all this shit coming from?' Unless sitting through four films in a row has addled my memory, I heard it asked by a breathless Elizabeth Hurley as she flapped, Daphne Duck running on a catwalk, along the cheap corridors of this tawdry shlock-horror attempt at psychological melodrama. Suffering the fate of all mad scientists, Ms Hurley was fleeing, together with her detective-hero, from nasty images. These were inserted into their collective dream by a proto-Frankenstein serial killer whose brainwaves invaded their skulls . . . It should terrify; in fact I had to shut my eyes for just a few seconds, as the screen-sized needle went in over the opening titles, and, unmentionably, later. But why be unpleasant? Let me be mealy-mouthed. Beyond Bedlam is badly written, unconvincing, poorly directed and a disservice to its cast. It could, without further assistance, finally bury the reputation of British-made films. If it is offered in an aircraft, take evasive action. Make for the emergency exit and jump. That leaves the question I fancy I heard Ms Hurley put. It is a jewel, of sorts. It encapsulates the Ratner's setting in which I keep telling myself it was delivered. It may not reveal what goes on in your mind or mine, but it certainly tells us what the moving picture industry is capable of aiming at our heads. 'Where is all this shit coming from?' is exactly right for the present season, both of cinema and the news. The latter is dispiriting when made in Westminster, ghastly when emanating from Bosnia. Invited to fill in for the absent Nigel Andrews, I therefore welcomed the prospect of a short respite from real life. What a fool] The great escape of science fiction is dependent upon memories of Star Wars. No musical, MGM or otherwise, came along to lighten the darkness. Not even the balm of syrupy romance was on offer. Painted Heart is at least restful, if you forget the moment the hero cuts his forearm to prove his love. A quirky piece, it shows how to portray serial killers with delicacy and taste. It suggests violence without rubbing it in; passion without anyone taking their trousers off. It is lightly humorous, for which much thanks. Willie, the sk in question, is beaten up by his vile father. Naturally he grows up to become a murderer of old drunks, whom he lures into the back of dilapidated buildings. This is, however, only his hobby: he holds on to his daytime job. A house-painter, he employs three assistants. One of them, Wesley, falls in love with and seduces Willie's wife Margaret, a simple soul nicely played by Bebe Neuwirth. All the characters are of low intelligence and little education. Except for the absence of swear-words, the dialogue could have come from a playground. Informed by a pop-eyed Wesley that her husband is a 'real certified serial killer', Margaret, eyes popping back, responds that if Willie heard that 'you won't be painting around here for a long time'. Her bungalow in suburban Wisconsin looks authentic; the scenes showing bored house-painters pushing their rollers up the walls of larger houses are realistic. The bars to which the painter-buddies go after work feel genuine. Robert Pastorelli plays Willie for sympathy, and gets it; Will Patton does a good empty-headed Wesley. When it all goes wrong, his relationship with Margaret, she tells him, is 'a . . . a . . . cracked cup.' These are weak, undemanding folk, in a film which suits such characters. There is, likewise, nothing demanding about Back in the USSR, a film whose essence most of us have seen many times. It is the nearest thing to a holiday for the brain. A young couple find love. First the boy, Frank Whaley, falls by accident into an adventure involving a stolen treasure lifted by the charming Natalya Negoda. She plays an apprentice prostitute ('it was her first time, and she hated it'). We see rival gangs, shoot-outs, suspect police, a treacherous diplomat, an infuriating doorman, and Roman Polanski. This familiar mix has the comfort of old slippers. There are no surprises, and if there are loose ends, nobody cares. There is a further advantage. Back in the USSR is a Russian-American collaboration, exploiting the ample wastebins of Hollywood for its tone, while shooting on location in Moscow. You get an hour and a half of Valium, plus a free travelogue. The best bit is a chase in the GUM department store. Busy Moscow street scenes are interspersed with picture-postcard shots of Red Square, the subway, the Kremlin and the Izmailova flea market. A rickety taxi rumbles down shoddy back streets. Ms Negoda inhabits a thieves' paint-peeled apartment, furnished with barely sufficient necessities. Old soldiers remind you of the Soviets' war; an ample lady street-cleaner provides further verisimilitude. When our lovebirds get on a train the camera lingers over the Russian faces in adjoining seats. The Orthodox Church is part of the tour, as is that enduring Western image, the substandard 'luxury' hotel bedroom. The underlying proposition that this may be what it was like as the Soviet Union reached its end, is, however, buried by commercial garbage. Mosfilm, once the proud home of Eisenstein, helped make Back in the USSR. It is no 'Potemkin', just what you might expect with a production manager called Boguslavsky. Serial killing Japanese-style is a serious matter. The gangsters in Sonatine carelessly shoot one another, causing paint-potsful of blood to spurt from their wounds, They are coolly, philosophically, murderous. They care neither for life nor death; so why, when they meet the latter, should we? Perhaps because this is not an entirely worthless film. Takeshi Kitano's eccentric assault on our sensibilities is carefully stylised. It is equipped with the most opulent cars and the best guns of the week. Clearly the chief thugs of the yakuza are rich. Their headquarters office might have been conceived by Attali, although their temporary hide-out, in Okinawa, is properly flaky. The beach scenes, which could have been shot on any coast in the world, are balletic. The action moves between simple pop-pop shooting and old-time vaudeville as the gunfighters hide away in a coastal house. They play games on the sands: two thin mock-sumo wrestlers in a seaweed ring; Russian roulette with no bullets; frisbee. Then everyone gets killed. Kitano, starring in his own film, started life as a stand-up comic. He still occasionally comes across as Benny Hill, his beatific smile breaking out at regular intervals. When his moll removes her wet T-shirt he cracks a Benny Hill joke through his chubby cheeks. He remembers to look serious as he forgets how long he can leave an enemy under water without drowning him, or when he expresses fatigue at his gangsterish way of life. Tired of living, but evidently not scared of dying, he clears his brain with a carefully-aimed bullet. It is the least he could do.</p>

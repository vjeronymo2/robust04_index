			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Luis R. Aizpeolea: "Socialists Rule Out Early </F> Election"]    [Text] The People's Party [PP] has defeated the PSOE  [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] in nationwide elections for  the first time and has succeeded in clearly breaking the  absolute majority held by the Socialists in Andalusia since  1982. The Socialists yesterday acknowledged their defeat by the  People's Party. This was made known by Socialist parliamentary  group spokesman Joaquin Almunia, although he explained  immediately afterward that domestic conclusions should not be  drawn from these elections, and ruled out bringing forward the  [general] election. PP Deputy Secretary General Mariano Rajoy  said that the Spanish political map had changed, but he  initially remained cautious and did not call for a general  election, while Abel Matutes demanded that the government hold a  confidence vote.    The European election results had a certain national color,  manifested in an increase in the turnout compared to the  previous elections of five years ago, although appreciably lower  than that of the June 1993 legislative elections.    In the light of the first figures provided by the polls, the  main parties' representatives were already playing on both  aspects in order to express their stances. Mariano Rajoy, on  behalf of the People's Party, emphasized that "the Spanish  political map has changed" since the 1993 general election, and  hence his party "will work on the formulation of a national  blueprint." The PP leader avoided calling for an early  election, despite his party's clear victory in the European  elections, and maintained a cautious stance.    In his first assessment of the elections, PP list leader  Abel  Matutes maintained a tone similar to Rajoy's. In a moderate  tone, he stated that these elections were a test of the  government, and added that they are the "start of a political  change." Matutes then added: "We will try to consolidate it by  democratic means."    Socialist parliamentary group spokesman Joaquin Almunia  began  by acknowledging his party's defeat by the PP, but he then asked  that these elections' results not influence domestic politics,  and ruled out an early election, although he acknowledged that  "matters should be given due consideration." The Socialist  leader argued this stance in this way: "These are elections to  the European Parliament; the general election was a year ago,  and there is great deal of the legislative term to go." Almunia  argued that "the turnout was appreciably lower than in last  year's general election. Moreover, there was a certain  reluctance to vote in the constituencies where we Socialists  receive most support."  <H5>  Economic Crisis </H5>   For his part, PSOE Secretary for Organization Cipria Ciscar  emphasized the need to distinguish this electoral process from  that concerning a general election, and congratulated the PP on  its first election victory.    Foreign Minister Javier Solana yesterday congratulated the  PP  and attributed the punitive vote against the government to the  economic crisis. Despite his party's defeat, the minister  interpreted Convergence and Union's increase as a sign that the  Spanish people want a stable government.    The Catalan and Basque nationalists, who have improved their  positions, were satisfied with the result yesterday, and have  found that the policy of support for the government has not  adversely affected them at the polls. The nationalists' result  is the government's only consolation, insofar as its stability  will not be attacked on that flank.    Inaki Anasagasti, Basque Nationalist Party spokesman in the  Congress [of Deputies], was clear yesterday, as soon as the  first election results were known. He stated that these  elections should not affect domestic politics. Jose Perez  Moreno, the spokesman of Democratic Union of Catalonia, the  party allied with Convergence, expressed his satisfaction at the  Catalan nationalists' increase in votes and stressed that they  had overtaken the Socialists in Catalonia, which did not happen  in the general election.    Isabelo Herreros, on behalf of United Left, was the only  person to demand Felipe Gonzalez' resignation in light of the  results. He emphasized the size of the turnout in comparison  with the 1989 European elections, and called on Prime Minister  Felipe Gonzalez to act accordingly. "Let him resign," Herreros  said.    But for the Socialists, the results of the Andalusian  autonomous community elections are almost as bad as those of the  European elections. In the Socialists' traditional fief, they  have lost the absolute majority, with a considerable surge by  the People's Party and United Left. Socialist Manuel Chaves,  winner of the elections, will encounter difficulties in forming  a government. The outcome prevents them from governing on their  own, and their closest candidate with which to share the  government -- United Left -- upholds stances very remote from  the PSOE's.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban April 11 SAPA -- The kwaZulu Police [KZP] on  Monday [11 April] reported 10 weekend murders in the homeland  while the SA Police [SAP] in Natal reported at least 24 deaths,  pushing the violence toll in kwaZulu/Natal since Friday to at  least 34. The number of reported killings in the province since  the state of emergency was declared on March 31 now stands at at  least 167.    Most deaths have been politically linked, while some have  resulted from ordinary crime.    The SAP on Monday afternoon reported three further killings  in separate weekend attacks in Ladysmith's Ezakheni township. In  total, four people were killed there since Friday.    The KZP, meanwhile, reported 10 killings in kwaZulu -- most  in townships south of Durban. Two people were also killed in a  taxi dispute in the Nongoma area of kwaZulu, said the kzp.    Reports indicated violence was widespread in Natal at the  weekend.    Among the victims were three people who were shot dead in  the  North Coast area of Stanger on Friday night when gunmen opened  fire on pedestrians. Two people were injured. The dead were  named as Nanthani Mbonambi, Lizwe Gcaleke and Walter Magwaza.  The motive for the attack appeared to be political, police said.    KwaMashu and Inanda remained flashpoints of violence in  areas  north of Durban.    Police said three suspected robbers were caught by community  members and stabbed to death in the Amawoti area of Inanda on  Sunday. Local police said a man was shot dead in nearby J  section of kwaMashu while a man was fatally shot at the  township's Tembalihle railway station on Sunday.</p>

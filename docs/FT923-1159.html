Net interest charges amounted to Pounds 3.39m (Pounds 2.66m), none of which was capitalised. In the last full year, interest totalled Pounds 9.5m, with Pounds 3.3m capitalised and Pounds 6.2m charged to the profit and loss account. Borrowings at the period end were Pounds 59m, down from Pounds 74m in December. Fully diluted earnings per share dipped to 0.5p (0.9p); the company does not pay interim dividends.</p>

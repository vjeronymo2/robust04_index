			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Russia and G-7 countries ended two days of talks in  Germany on Sunday by pledging commitment to further dialogue and  cooperation in the area of finances, a senior Finance Ministry  official told Interfax on Monday. The Russian delegation led by  Acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin was involved in the G-7  finance ministers' meeting there.    The delegation also held bilateral talks with finance  ministers of the U.S., Germany and France as well as IMF  Managing Director Michel Camdessus and representatives of the  Paris and London Club of donor countries, the source said. More  importantly, he said, the G-7 countries reaffirmed their plans  for further cooperation with Russia despite the resignation of  Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov. At the same time, it was pointed  to the need to pay greater attention to social security matters.    For his part, Dubinin said that welcome as G-7 aid might be,  Moscow would largely rely on its own resources.    The source said the G-7 finance ministers were invited to  attend an EBRD-sponsored meeting in St Petersburg at the end of  April intended to continue the dialogue.    On Russia-IMF talks in Moscow, the ministry official spoke  of  understanding reached on main issues though the two sides were  still at odds on technicalities such as Russia's budget deficit.    The government plans a Rbl [rubles] 58 Tn [trillion] deficit  this year. The Finance Ministry is ready to cover only Rbl 37  Tn of the proposed figure at the cost of CBR credits which makes  up about 5 percent of the GDP. Inflation will be reduced to 8-9  percent by the end of 1994 (It ran at 22 percent in January) if  the budget parameters are observed.</p>

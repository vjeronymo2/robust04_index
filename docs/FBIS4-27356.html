			<p>CSO     [Text] Matsushita Electric Industrial announced on 11 May  that it will put on sale on 21 June a "television personal  computer" where television can be seen and CD's [compact disks]  enjoyed on the screen of a personal computer which houses a  television tuner. Matsushita is introducing their forte of AV  technology into personal computers, and further strengthening  their information home electronics field. The shipment of  personal computers for multimedia which can process graphics and  audio in addition to character data is expanding year by year,  and IBM Japan, NEC, and others are also planning to introduce  products which have a television function. If a communications  service for both is begun in the future, there also are  expectations that the "television personal computer" will become  the favorite multimedia terminal within the home, and  competition has begun between home electronics and personal  computer manufacturers concerning the new market.    The DOS/V specification personal computer "Woody" which  Matsushita Electric Industrial is putting on sale is standard  equipped with audio multiplex television tuner, stereo speakers,  and a CD-ROM device (read only memory using compact disk).  Besides being able to see television on a 14-inch personal  computer screen, CD-ROM, music CD's, and "photo CD's" that store  photos on CD's also can be enjoyed.    Television programs can be received even while operating the  personal computer. For example, a news program is shown in a  corner of the screen while preparing a document with word  processing software. In order to digitize the analog television  video, the necessary scene is made into a static graphic and  introduced as data video in the document, and can be stored on a  hard disk. Use by beginners is assumed and recording of graphics  is performed by a simple button operation.    The price is 358,000 yen for the model which carries a  170-megabyte hard disk, and 398,000 yen for the 340-megabyte  model. They are set at a rather high price compared to  multimedia personal computers equipped with a CD-ROM device.  "The target is the young age group of students up to 31 years  old. Rather than enjoyment by the whole family, demand for one  machine per person is expected." (Mutsuo Miyake, manager,  Computer Division, Matsushita Electric Industrial) They are  scheduling yearly production of 50,000 machines.    IBM Japan soon will put on sale a television personal  computer carrying a television tuner with "PS/V vision" as the  basis. With price on the mid-300,000 yen level, it will directly  run up against the new products of Matsushita Electric  Industrial. NEC also believes that "The color screen of a  personal computer can be applied to television, telephones, and  facsimile. We will be steadily introducing information equipment  in the home" (Director Yuki Takayama). The time has not yet been  decided, but it appear that they will introduce a television  personal computer within the year.    It seems that they will proceed quickly in the future with  "making a personal computer home appliance" that incorporates  various functions such as a telephone and facsimile.</p>

			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MASSIVE EARTHQUAKE JOLTS BAY AREA  </P> <P> Even before the shaking stopped ham radio operators were establishing  communication links with the San Francisco area. Hundreds of volunteers, many  staying up all night, pinpointed and communicated information about need for  emergency services, damage reports, and handled health and welfare inquiries to  and from the area.  </P> <P> The major ham radio FM communication link between Northern and Southern  California is the Condor system of several linked repeaters (relay stations).  This system, built entirely by hams at their own expense, is very reliable  because it is not hampered by changes in atmospheric conditions. It handled  continuous high-quality emergency communications throughout the nights and days  following the San Francisco earthquake. It did the same after the Whittier  quake.  </P> <P> Condor uses the lower end of the 220-megahertz ham band to connect its  repeaters. Under very suspicious and unusual circumstances the Federal  Communications Commission recently ruled that the use of this spectrum of  frequency will be taken away from the hams and made available to commercial  business interests. The loss will be a major one to the brilliant and dedicated  hobbyist who built the system but it will be an even greater loss to the  citizens of California when the next disaster strikes.  </P> <P> ALAN GINSBURG  </P> <P> Seal Beach  </P></p>

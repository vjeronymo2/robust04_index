			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Abu Dhabi briefed on BCCI investigation BRITISH officials are confident that criticism of Abu Dhabi's role in the Bank of Credit and Commerce International affair by the inquiry headed by Lord Justice Bingham will not be so severe as to risk a row between the two governments. Officials say criticism of Abu Dhabi's role in the affair is far less extensive than that levelled at other institutions, especially the Bank of England. Extracts from Lord Justice Bingham's final conclusions relating to Abu Dhabi were circulated among Foreign Office officials early last week after being delivered to the Treasury and the Bank of England. This followed months of activity by UK diplomats aimed at limiting the damage the BCCI affair might do to relations between the UK and Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder in BCCI. Last year the United Arab Emirates, which includes Abu Dhabi, was the UK's second largest trading partner in the Middle East after Saudi Arabia. A draft of the Bingham report criticises Abu Dhabi for delaying giving the Bank of England information on the scale of the fraud at BCCI. It highlights as a serious omission a nine-month delay in communicating details of the losses and fraud - including the theft of Dollars 2.2bn of Abu Dhabi's funds. Abu Dhabi and its advisers are understood to reject what they see as a slur on the emirate's reputation, but Abu Dhabi government representatives have reassured British officials that the emirate is prepared to continue to keep bilateral relations separate from the issue of BCCI. It is understood that Abu Dhabi is considering a study prepared by the Ministry of Defence on how UK military personnel and defence equipment could be used in the reorganisation and modernisation of armed forces in the UAE, which Britain considers an important ally against Iraq. A federal judge in Washington has been asked to order Abu Dhabi to hand over shares of First American Bankshares, the US bank illegally controlled by BCCI, Alan Friedman in New York writes. The move was instigated by lawyers for Mr Harry Albright, the independent trustee for First American appointed last June after the Federal Reserve Board ordered that the bank be sold. Mr Albright said the action followed long negotiations that failed to persuade Abu Dhabi to hand over the shares. Mr Sandy Martin, a partner at the Washington law firm of Patton, Boggs and Blow, representing Abu Dhabi, said the shares had been registered in Mr Albright's name. However, some of the shares are held by Abu Dhabi as security on a Dollars 9.5m loan. 'We believe that unless we are told otherwise by a court it is our obligation to retain possession of the certificates,' Mr Martin said.</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London COCOA prices continued last week's rally as the September contract climbed towards Pounds 750 a tonne. New York's higher opening provoked a spurt of buying interest in London in the afternoon, but traders attribute the recent break-out mainly to technical factors. London robusta COFFEE prices lost further ground in the afternoon as the market drifted back in line with New York. Earlier hopes that prices might attempt to edge higher faded quickly as New York opened lower. Both markets continued to disregard talk of retention schemes among Latin American producers. 'How many times have we heard this before? Anything that starts from outside an international coffee agreement never takes off,' one trader said. On the LME three-month COPPER was unable to hold above Dollars 1,900 a tonne after advancing in early trading. But dealers said a further attempt is likely today. Three-month ALUMINIUM was unable to reach the Dollars 1,215 a tonne target, easing from its highs on the kerb with copper, but remaining technically constructive. GOLD futures were trading near session lows at midday on Comex. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Company News: Control Data in red after charges CONTROL Data, the US computer systems and services company, suffered a net loss for 1991 after restructuring charges. Revenues declined as sales of computer products and automated lottery equipment slowed, the company said. Net losses for the year were Dollars 9.8m, or 24 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 1.5bn. In 1990, Control Data reported net earnings of Dollars 2.7m, or 5 cents, on revenues of Dollars 1.7bn. Excluding pre-tax restructuring charges of Dollars 12.1m, the company was modestly profitable for the year. It reported a fourth-quarter net loss of Dollars 15.2m, or 36 cents, after a restructuring charge of Dollars 17.5m as the company realigned its computer products operations. Last year, it suffered a net loss of Dollars 23.8m, or 56 cents. Revenues for the fourth quarter declined to Dollars 402.9m from Dollars 429.7m. 'Satisfactory results in most of the information services businesses and government systems were more than offset by the effect that the deteriorating economy and industry issues had on the automated wagering and computer products businesses, and by restructuring charges,' said Mr Lawrence Perlman, president and chief executive. Restructuring plans, announced last September, have reduced costs and expenses, the company said.</p>

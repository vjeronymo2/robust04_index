			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / International Company News: Full bid for Custos abandoned VOLVO, the Swedish motor vehicle company, and Skanska, Scandinavia's largest construction group, yesterday abandoned their bid for full control of Custos, the investment concern which they already majority own, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. The two companies said the upturn in the Swedish stock market and falling interest rates, following the floating of the krona, had greatly improved Custos' financial situation. They indicated that big shareholders had rebuffed the offer, worth about SKr750m (USDollars 109m). But a joint bid for the minority stake in a smaller investment group, Protorp, is being continued, and the terms improved to SKr200 per share from SKr131 per share. This offer values the company at SKr2bn.</p>

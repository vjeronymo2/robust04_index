			<p>931102 FT  02 NOV 93 / Survey of Corporate Treasury Management (8): Alcos provide an 'engine-room' - Banks' management of balance-sheet risk BALANCE SHEET risk is now commonly managed by banks and building societies through central committees. Though sometimes known as risk committees, or balance sheet management committees, the popular label is 'the asset and management liability committee' - or Alco. Members represent each part of the balance sheet. The committee will often include the treasurer, the heads of lending and fund acquisition departments, the head of corporate planning and managers from international divisions. The main function is to maximise earnings through overall management of acquisition and allocation of funds. Strategy is laid down through monitoring asset and liability distributions and maturities, earnings margins and appraisal of liability and loan pricing policies across a bank's portfolio of businesses. Alcos originated in the 1980s in the US. Growth in financial markets was accompanied by an increase in the range and complexity of financial products available. Risks consequently increased and new ways of taking and avoiding risk mushroomed. Banks realised that top-level management was required, hence the genesis of the Alco. The committee's remit typically extends to the setting of high-level limits, with board approval, in the key areas of interest-rate risk, currency risk, liquidity risk, equity price risk and settlement risk. In some banks country and industry, portfolio risk is also managed by the committee. Royal Bank of Scotland set up its Alco last year. 'We recognised as a bank that we needed an engine-room to effectively manage the risk that was arising across the bank's business strategies,' says Mr Peter HanIon, head of group asset and liability management 'It was to make sure that everybody put their group hats on, so to speak, rather than their divisional hats.' Up to then, the bank had a decentralised approach to risk management. As well as ensuring that divisional strategies result in a balance sheet that the group is comfortable with, RBS's Alco also acts as a communication conduit, educating different parts of the group on market and credit risk. The committee meets monthly and deals with high-level decisions. 'It's not concerned with housekeeping,' says Mr HanIon. Price Waterhouse partner, Mr Andrew Stott, is involved in setting up and advising on the running of asset and liability management units and the committees they report to. He estimates that three quarters of British banks and building societies now have an Alco, but doesn't think that this means asset and liability risks are necessarily being properly dealt with. 'Just having an Alco doesn't mean that you're effective in managing your balance sheet,' he warns. A particular problem is undue influence of one part of a bank over the Alco. Ideally, the committee should be chaired by the chief executive, but this may not happen in practice. In particular, in smaller banks and building societies asset and liability risk management may be run from the treasury, due to the fact that the expertise required to analyse structural risk is often far more developed in treasury than other areas. First Consulting recently conducted a survey of the operations of Alcos in 19 British banks and building societies. 'There are people who say they are an Alco - they say they are looking at the whole balance sheet - but actually their conversations in their monthly meetings are predominantly about treasury issues,' says First Consulting's Magnus Spence. Treasuries are commonly geared to short-term structural risk, while the Alco needs to assess risk against a bank's long-term goals. 'There could be conflicting risk strategies,' says Mr Stott, at Price Waterhouse. need not arise if the two functions are clearly separated within a treasury with clear individual objectives, but that this is easier to ensure if personnel are within different divisions. A key issue for RBS's Alco is liability sourcing. For all banks, low interest rates have produced outflows from customer accounts. RBS has a policy of moving towards more stable retail deposits, and the Alco aims to provide incentives for the process and speed it up. The TSB has been running its Alco - known by the less catchy title of 'group balance sheet management committee' - for around five years in its current form, and has devised strategies for tackling the same problem. 'You're looking to put on basically more fixed mortgages and more personal loans,' explains Mr John Ashenhurst, director of TSB's group balance sheet management unit and secretary of the UK Asset and Liability Association. One approach is to vary price sensitivity from account to account, and for interest-rate tiers within accounts. 'The old way was that you said that everything was either sensitive or insensitive. What we're saying is that it might be sensitive today, but it may not be tomorrow,' says Mr Ashenhurst. Changes in rates alter structural risk and policy. 'If interest rates go up, you will probably have to reprice the liabilities so that they won't be exposed,' says Mr Ashenhurst. 'It's timing and getting it right that is the main issue.' As well as increased marketing of fixed-rate mortgages and personal loans, TSB is hedging the exposure from low-interest rate tiers in customers' accounts by investments in gilts and swaps. Moves by depositors into equities inevitably means that banks are looking to the interbank market for funds. This changes the balance sheet's risk profile, notably for liquidity risk, and presents Alcos with another set of policy decisions. A battery of instruments are available to banks for redistribution of risk. 'Depending on their expectations, they could use interest rate derivatives, for example,' explains Andrew Stott. A key function of the Alco is the co-ordination of competing demands by a bank's different operating units for a share of the balance sheet. Return on capital, adjusted for the various kinds of risk, is a fundamental performance indicator. 'You invest your capital in the highest performing business units,' explains Peter HanIon. 'It's an incremental approach based on bidding and competing.' An important back-up to the Alco is the data provided by a balance sheet simulation model. The effects of different capital allocation strategies and of the use of new products can be predicted. Developed in the US, they have been widely purchased by UK banks and building societies. 'It gives you a dynamic dimension to your balance sheet,' says Mr HanIon.</p>

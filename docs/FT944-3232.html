			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Hanson chief pay boosted to Pounds 1.04m Mr Derek Bonham, deputy chairman and chief executive of Hanson, saw his total pay rise by a third to Pounds 1.04m for the year ended September 30. This was because of a bonus which was linked to the group's 32 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the period to Pounds 1.35bn. Lord Hanson, the chairman, received an unchanged amount of Pounds 1.36m. Under a scheme introduced two years ago the executive directors received bonuses totalling Pounds 2.49m, of which Pounds 1.45m related to directors whose services are performed mainly outside the UK. The previous year, when profits were depressed by the recession and the coal dispute at Peabody, the total bonus was Pounds 265,000 of which Pounds 218,000 related to US directors. Lord Hanson is not included in this scheme. The regular salary bill for the executive directors rose 7 per cent to Pounds 7.26m with total directors' emoluments up by a quarter to Pounds 11.4m.</p>

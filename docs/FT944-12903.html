			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / FT Schools 1000 - Survey of Secondary Education (7): Calling at half-way houses - The appeal of informality If pupils want to escape school at 16, but want a 'halfway house' before going to university, sixth-form colleges may be the answer. More than 100 have been set up in the past two decades by local authorities mostly trying to save money  - they can be more economical than maintaining small sixth forms at schools. The government is showing signs of halting this, with the Department for Education giving the go-ahead for several 11-16 schools to start sixth forms. Former education secretary, John Patten, had said they were like 'a body without a head'. All sixth-form colleges have been removed from local authority control, and are funded on the same basis as further education colleges. But the colleges, at least in some cases, are beginning to show their worth. Judging them for league table purposes is difficult because their large size  - one of their prime advantages as it allows them to provide a broader, more flexible curriculum  - makes it harder for them to sustain a high average points score. Most are non-selective and cater for students doing mainly vocational courses. It is common for students to take a vocational course plus an A-level in maths, which would show up badly in the FT rankings. Some further education colleges offer no A-levels, or only offer them as access courses for adults, which should not be compared with teaching 18-year-olds. Others offer full-time A-level courses as an addition to vocational training, but these are not included, as it would be unfair to take A-level results as a measure of overall performance. The Department for Education's league tables tackle these problems by quoting the average UCAS points for candidates who attempt two or more A-levels, and for those who attempt fewer than two. This separates those taking an A-level to top up a vocational course from students taking a fully academic course. The sixth-form colleges in the FT's table (above) are all primarily academic, and their results cover all pupils who attempted A-levels. Once it is taken into account that they are offering broad curricula and entering as many as 700 candidates each year, some of their results seem spectacular. As usual, catchment areas are the prime determinant of success, with Cambridge's Hills Road Sixth Form College topping the rankings. Colchester Sixth Form College is perhaps the most dramatic example of the benefits of large scale. Entering around 700 candidates each year, it takes students regularly from nine schools, and attracts many more from outside its catchment. It offers 40 A-level subjects including law, physical education, and philosophy. Students are also offered 19 subjects at AS-level, allowing them more opportunities to achieve a balance between arts and sciences than with conventional A-levels. The college also regularly manages to find places at Oxford and Cambridge for about 15 students each year. Its top 100 candidates this year gained an average of 33.07 UCAS points, which ranks the college among academic giants like Westminster and St Paul's. This was achieved despite the presence in Colchester of two of the country's most successful grammar schools, which both take 100 pupils each year. Although the college is over-subscribed, many students have failed a grammar school entrance exam. Principal John Edwards says that some parents are worried by the informality  - there is no uniform, and staff are addressed by their first names. Internal politics also resembles a university union, with elected student representatives having a voice in college policies. During breaks the college, based around old school buildings in the centre of Colchester, feels more like a university than a school. Its size helps in other respects. Colchester finished third in the national swimming championships  - behind Millfield and Kelly, both of which specialise in the sport. The advantages of scale are great, and league tables often fail to reflect them. The UK's largest comprehensive - the Stantonbury Campus in Milton Keynes  - also resembles a university more than a school, with fine theatre and sporting facilities available to the community. Its aggregate results may look less impressive but still include examples of excellence. Elsewhere, urban schools have countered threats to their sixth forms by starting sixth-form consortia and by pooling resources, allowing students to take an A-level at another school if there is insufficient demand for it at their own. One outlandishly named example in the FT-1,000 is La SWAP in north-west London. This is a joint operation of La Sainte Union, William Ellis, Acland Burghley, and Parliament Hill schools in Camden, London. Its position, barely below average for the FT-1000, in an area where it competes against some of the most selective academic schools, is also better than it appears.

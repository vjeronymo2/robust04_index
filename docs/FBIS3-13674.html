			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In a telephone interview by Mikha Friedman earlier  this morning, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres was asked to  confirm the report we received from Tunis about a forthcoming  meeting between him and PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat:    [Begin recording] [Peres] Right now it is more of a radio  encounter, because no date for such a meeting has been actually  set.    [Friedman] But a date and a place is being sought, because  the two of you want to meet.    [Peres] It is not a question of our wanting to meet. I  think the negotiations must be resumed in the appropriate manner  and with momentum. The Hebron tragedy undoubtedly created a new  situation which has to be addressed and overcome, and  conclusions should be drawn from it.    [Friedman] Is it true that there is talk of some kind of  sequential deal under which Israel would be prepared to....    [Peres, interrupting] I do not like the word deal; we do not  need deals. We would like to address every issue on its value.  There is a mutual interest in preventing the killing of both  Arabs and Jews. The present situation is truly intolerable.    [Friedman] Is it possible that Shim'on Peres' view that the  Jewish settlement in the heart of Hebron is detrimental and  injurious to the peace process may be adopted -- at least in  part -- and that as a result, all the Jews residing in the heart  of Arab Hebron will soon be moved to one site?    [Peres] What is certain is that we would not discuss such an  issue with any foreign, non-Israeli element. Israel would have  to make such a decision alone, independently, taking its own  factors into consideration. This is not an issue for  negotiation. At the same time, the way the Jews are sprawled  out in Hebron is unquestionably awful: We are spread out over  five sites, one of which is inhabited by eight families, each  living in a camper. This causes us much concern. Hebron is  still under curfew, but that is no long-term solution and they  have been under curfew for a long time already. I regret to say  that the dream of coexistence between settlers and Palestinians  received a terrible blow in the Tomb of the Patriarchs.    [Friedman] To make your Sunday meeting with 'Arafat  possible, the government will have to make the decision on  Hebron sooner than planned.    [Peres] I do not know; I do not think one depends on the  other.    [Friedman] Mr. Peres, we disclosed this morning that two IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] bases have been moved from densely  populated Arab areas in Gaza. I would like to ask you whether  that is part of our gestures to 'Arafat and part of the  evacuation and redeployment process, which has started despite  the absence of a relevant political decision.    [Peres] No, that has absolutely nothing to do with the  negotiations. It has to do with the IDF deployment in the  Strip. There are places where the IDF is being reinforced and  others where it is reducing its presence in anticipation of  future deployment, but these are unilateral Israeli steps.    [Friedman] Thank you very much, Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres.    [Peres] You are welcome. [end recording]</p>

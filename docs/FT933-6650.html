			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Turnround at S Daniels S DANIELS continued its recovery in the first half to June 30 with pre-tax profits of Pounds 25,000, compared with a Pounds 105,000 deficit. This followed progress in the second half of 1992 which resulted in a reduced loss of Pounds 64,000 for that year. The importer and distributor for the food industry said the period under review benefited from its dried fruit activities while the raw materials business also achieved a satisfactory result. Mr Paul Daniels, chairman, said the outcome for the six months would have been considerably better were it not for problems in the confectionery business in a competitive market. The company had also moved its focus towards de-veloping its beverage activi-ties and further investment in production was planned. Options being considered included a possible factory move. Turnover improved by 6 per cent to Pounds 16.7m (Pounds 15.7m). Earnings per share were 0.3p (1.3p losses).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article from Gilberto Scofield Junior's "Economic Report" </F> column]    [Text] The governments of Uruguay and Paraguay have set  their eyes on free trade zones in Brazil (in Manaus) and  Argentina (in Tierra del Fuego, near the Beagle Canal), which  are the latest difficulty for a consolidated implementation of  the Common Market of the South [Mercosur]. Paraguayan and  Uruguayan diplomats have made it clear: They do not agree to  free trade zones inside Mercosur unless their countries can also  establish theirs. Their fear makes sense. After all, areas with  fiscal privileges that can send products to the giant common  market at a low cost are a threat to any industrial park.    "The countries already have reached an accord on the  export-processing zones, but negotiations on free trade zones  continue," said Antonio Sergio Martins, secretary for industrial  policy in the Industry, Commerce and Tourism Ministry. The  problem is of a geo-economic nature. The Manaus and Tierra del  Fuego free trade zones were established as a strategy to develop  remote regions in Brazil and Argentina. These zones are nearly  3,000 km from the two large countries' consumption centers.  Uruguay and Paraguay are very small countries. Even if the free  trade zones are established far from these two countries'  capitals, they will not be more than 400 km from the consumption  centers and very near southern Brazil and northern Argentina.    Instead of putting an end to the existing free trade zones,  the solution may be to reduce the fiscal benefits currently in  force in Manaus and Tierra del Fuego. The curious thing,  however, is that the Brazilian Congress recently renewed the  paternalistic benefits granted to the Manaus Free Trade Zone for  a few more years.    Meanwhile, Mercosur goes into force on 1 January 1995.</p>

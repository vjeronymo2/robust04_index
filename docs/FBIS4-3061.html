			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 17 (XINHUA) -- Serbian tanks  entered the embattled town of Gorazde today across shattered  Muslim positions around the town despite U.N. officials'  announcement that a truce had been reached.    U.N. officials said that 21 people had been killed Sunday  [17  April] and 55 wounded and that the fightings were even more  tense after the ceasefire announcement.    "Bosnian army defenses around Gorazde have collapsed. They  are non-existent," U.N. Peacekeeping Force Spokesman Rob Annink  said, adding that "there is nothing to stop them except a  command of their own political leadership."    The Serb siege of Gorazde, a Muslim enclave declared by the  U.N. as a "safe area," provoked two NATO air strikes last Sunday  and Monday.    Serb forces retaliated against the NATO strikes, detaining  U.N. personnel last week and shooting down a British war jet  over Gorazde Sunday.    This was the first NATO aircraft downed during military  operations in Bosnia.    With the Serbs continuing their siege despite U.N. efforts  to  broker a ceasefire, U.N. chief representative for Yugoslavia  today admitted that "the means at our disposal are not  sufficient to cope with the situation."    At least 200,000 people have been killed or missing in the  fightings between the Muslims, Serbs and Croats in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Profits warning clips 7p off Eurocopy share price SHARES IN Eurocopy yesterday fell 7p to 32p following a warning from the photocopier distribution company that second half profits would show only a minor improvement over the Pounds 720,000 achieved in the first six months. House broker Panmure Gordon cut forecasts for the year to September 30 from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 1.5m on the news. Last year, Eurocopy reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 7m. Mr Michael Armitage, finance director, said signs of business confidence detected immediately after the general election had since disappeared. 'After taking into account cost savings of some Pounds 200,000,' Eurocopy would show only a modest improvement in the second half, he said. Earlier this summer the company had blamed the effects of a government inquiry into the selling practices of some of its subsidiaries for the 80 per cent decline in interim profits. Mr Armitage said at the time that competition had exploited doubts sparked by the inquiry. Eurocopy's troubles began when it purchased a Scottish photocopier company in 1989. Complaints about misleading selling practices at the subsidiary sparked an inquiry by the Office of Fair Trading.</p>

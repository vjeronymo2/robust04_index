			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: TOW TRUCKS TO LOWER BOOM ON SCOFFLAWS  </P> <P> Scofflaws beware. Starting in July, San Diego parking controllers will be armed  with hand-sized computer gizmos.  </P> <P> As they write you a parking ticket, they'll punch in your license number. If  you have five or more unpaid tickets, lights will flash and a tow truck can be  summoned.  </P> <P> To reclaim your car, you'll have to pay your tickets, a late penalty and a  towing fee.  </P> <P> Unpaid tickets are serious fiscal stuff in San Diego: There are about 10,000  vehicles with five or more tickets, totaling $3.6 million in fines and  penalties. This in a city that is threatening to cut back on recreation  programs and library hours for lack of money.  </P> <P> To ease the shock, the City Council on Monday is set to designate June as  Parking Citation Amnesty Month. Tickets can be paid at face value, with  penalties.  </P> <P> Along with eliminating the cumbersome need to lug around lengthy lists of  repeat offenders, the computer system is seen as having another salutary  effect: improving the morale of parking controllers.  </P> <P> Next to being called meter maids, nothing bums out the scooter-riding  controllers like knowing that a lot of their tickets are just a waste of paper.  If all goes well, that will change.Vacations Born Again  </P> <P> Christmas and Easter are making a comeback in Vista.  </P> <P> A minister and a leader of a Christian political group petitioned the school  board to scuttle a year-old policy of using the terms winter and spring  vacation. The policy was meant to avoid any religious overtones.  </P> <P> "If the schools can celebrate Halloween, which was originally a celebration of  devils and witches, we see no reason that Christmas and Easter cannot be  mentioned," said Helen Rocha, a school bus driver and leader in the Christian  Voters League, which includes 300 families in Vista.  </P> <P> The board agreed, and the old terms will soon return.Back on the Map  </P> <P> Update: Rand McNally will include Cardiff-by-the-Sea in its 1990 Road Atlas.  </P> <P> After being dropped from the 1989 edition, Cardiff pleaded for reconsideration.  To community activists, disappearing from the atlas is the civic equivalent of  looking into the mirror and not seeing a reflection.  </P> <P> The giant map maker relented after discovering that Cardiff has its own freeway  signs and post office.Long Arm of the Bar  </P> <P> Almost five years after the fact, former Poway city attorney Jean Leonard  Harris has been publicly scolded by the California Supreme Court for an illegal  land sale.  </P> <P> Without comment, the court ordered Harris "publicly reproved," a punishment  less severe than disbarment or suspension but more serious than a private  scolding. He will also be required to pass an exam within a year.  </P> <P> A referee for the State Bar, who investigated the case, had recommended that  Harris be suspended from practicing law for 30 days. The justices rejected that  suggestion.  </P> <P> Harris was the $63,000-a-year attorney for a newly elected slow-growth council  in the early 1980s when his private land dealings went sour. "Jean caught a bad  case of real estate fever," says a former colleague.  </P> <P> By the time the fever broke, Harris had resigned, and a real estate company he  formed had filed for bankruptcy.  </P> <P> He pleaded guilty in July, 1984 to a misdemeanor count (plea-bargained down  from a felony) of selling a large chunk of land without telling the buyers it  was heavily indebted and not cleared for development. He was put on probation  and ordered to pay $49,528 in restitution.  </P> <P> His $15-million civil-rights suit against the district attorney was thrown out  of court.  </P> <P> Harris, 50, has been city attorney for Rancho Mirage near Palm Springs for five  years. In 1986 his legal past became an issue in a City Council election in  Rancho Mirage, a fact that he blames for reheating the State Bar's interest in  his case.  </P> <P> "It disgusts me that it takes them that long to decide what to do," Harris  said. "A lawyer really has no rights in the state of California in the way they  can be dealt with by the State Bar. It's not fair that I have to keep reliving  this thing."  </P></p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Finance and Investment (17): Customers back in favour - Foreign exchange / Philip Gawith assesses a change in attitudes Customers are back in fashion. That is the short message of foreign exchange markets in 1994. After a period of extraordinary profits in 1992/93, the focus has now swung sharply back towards relationships and service. The customer has been enthusiastically rediscovered, and his patronage is the subject of more keen competition. In 1992/93, it was proprietary traders - trading for banks' own account - who were the hot property in the labour market. Now, the premium attaches to corporate sales people who have a good set of client relationships. The catalyst for this shift was the US Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates on February 8. Until then, the foreign exchange markets were riding the crest of a wave, driven by strong rallies in US and European bond markets, and the extraordinary volatility surrounding the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) crisis in Europe. The downward trend in interest rates, and the one-way bets which the ERM provided, gave banks and investors the confidence to take large leveraged positions, and to make huge trading profits. The decision in August 1993 of the European Union's finance ministers to widen the ERM's fluctuation margins to 15 per cent around either side of the system's bilateral rates, from 2.25 per cent, removed one of these trends. Just as surely, the Fed removed the other when it signalled the turn in the interest rate cycle. This unleashed fears of rising inflation, causing enormous dislocation in world bond markets. Yields rose sharply and investors with large leveraged positions suffered heavy losses. This dramatic loss of liquidity spilled over into much more cautious position-taking in the foreign exchange markets. David Cocker, economist at Chemical Bank in London, comments: 'The lack of ability of people to make money in the bond markets has meant that institutional investors have pulled their horns in.' They were not the only ones. Some of the hedge funds, who figured so conspicuously in driving markets up, made large losses when they turned. George Soros, for example, confirmed that funds under his management made a Dollars 600m loss in a single day - February 14. The proprietary trading desks at some banks also made large losses. The net effect was that these investors reduced their exposure considerably. They shortened their trading horizon, seeking more prices from an interbank market that was increasingly nervous. Turnover figures are not available to substantiate the extent to which liquidity has been withdrawn, but the bulk of anecdotal evidence suggests that overall volumes, if anything, are slightly lower than in 1993. While customer business appears to have held up fairly well (as would be expected  -volatile financial markets do not stop corporates from trading) the level of discretionary activity - from hedge funds and the proprietary trading desks of banks - has been much reduced. The impact on the profits, though, is clear. Comparisons are tricky, because some banks do not break down their trading income, to show a specific foreign exchange component. What is evident is that those banks with a strong customer base suffered less than those with a stronger trading emphasis. This was especially so during the first quarter, when volatility was highest. Subsequent trading conditions have been much calmer. Where profits rose, they did so only by a small margin. Most were lucky to turn in a flat performance. If sharp rises in world bond yields provided foreign exchanges with an unexpected banana skin, the dollar provided another. Indeed, the two fed off each other. Only days after the Fed raised rates, the failure of President Clinton and Morihiro Hosokawa, Japanese prime minister at the time, to broker a trade accord, put the skids under the dollar. Many investors lost large sums and this put a further liquidity squeeze on the market. It was not supposed to be this way. At the turn of the year most observers thought the US economy would outperform its trading rivals, forcing interest rate differentials to move in its favour. Both trends, it was argued, would support the dollar, and many pundits saw the dollar appreciating to DM1.80-DM1.90 by the end of the year, and Y115-120, from DM1.7450 and Y112.50 at the start of the year. With the dollar at Y99 and DM1.55 in mid-September (having touched lows of Y96.80 and DM1.5235 in July), however, those who were bearish on the dollar had clearly won the day. These analysts stressed that the US's large trade and current account surpluses, coupled with ongoing capital outflows, were inimical to a stronger dollar. Aggravating matters was the long-running trade dispute between Japan and the US, with the Clinton administration seeking to cut its trade deficit with Japan by obtaining improved market access. For a long time the administration allowed the markets to believe that its policy towards the dollar was at best benign neglect, at worst 'dollar debasement' - talking the dollar down, the reasoning being that a cheaper dollar would improve US penetration of Japanese markets. By mid-year, the administration had changed its tune, and senior officials were at pains to stress that the US needed a strong dollar. By this time, however, markets were well and truly spooked by the spectre of rising interest rates. This cast a pall over US asset markets, and so long as foreign investors remained chary of buying US assets, fearing higher interest rates, the dollar had little chance of recovering. It was the misfortune of most investors and traders that they stood on the wrong side of the one clear trend - dollar down, yen up. For the rest, the complaint has been of range-bound, trendless trading. A good example concerns dollar/sterling, or 'cable', as it is known. In past years the average move has been 12-15 cents. In 1994, though, the currency has traded in a 3 to 4 cent range most of the time. In Europe, the widening of the ERM bands has, ironically, proven a great success. The product of extreme volatility, it has had the desired effect - at least from the perspective of governments and central banks - of stabilising exchange rates. There have been no repeats of the speculative frenzies which drove sterling and the lira out of the ERM. One clear trend in European currencies has been for the market to focus on high deficit countries. Accordingly, the Swedish krona and the Italian lira have been two of the most volatile currencies. This trend was bolstered by the re-emergence in September of the debate over a multi-speed Europe. The fear that some countries might not make it into the mainstream, and hence would be subject to less exacting financial discipline, caused investors to resort to safety first habits. Further afield, exotic currencies remained a growth area as corporates continued to globalise their activities, and fund managers continued their pursuit of emerging markets. Investors, however, are more cautious following some chastening experiences. Looking ahead, while most market participants are hoping that 1995 will prove a more fruitful year than 1994, few are expecting a return to the halcyon days of 1992/93.</p>

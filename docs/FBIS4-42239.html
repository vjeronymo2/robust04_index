			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Xavier Marchetti: "Meeting for Assessment"] </F>   [Text] Rotation sometimes works well. For a year,  beginning 1 July, Germany and then France will shoulder the  presidency of the European Union [EU] in succession. Statutory  alternation dictates this.    The two countries whose cooperation will have most strongly  influenced the move toward Europe, despite temporary  disagreements and fleeting quarrels, will be at the helm in  turn. And this comes at a difficult time. It is clear that  this welcome political continuity will either provide Europe  with a decisive impetus capable of giving it a real economic,  diplomatic, and even military identity, or the last opportunity  will be wasted.    The ground is fairly clear. The big upheavals are behind us.  Neither GATT, daunting because of the risks of division it  involved, especially between Paris and Bonn; nor last summer's  crisis which almost destroyed the European Monetary System; nor  the rather stormy ratification of the Maastricht Treaty sufficed  to block the EU's progress.    Once the danger is over, there is always a tendency to  underestimate it. It nonetheless existed, and it must be  admitted that, without Franco-German cooperation, it would  probably have ended in disaster. It is this cooperation which  Francois Mitterrand, Edouard Balladur, and Chancellor Kohl are  discussing in Mulhouse.    But this [Franco-German] summit will be more one of  assessment than decisionmaking. Indeed, the aim is to prepare  for the European Council meeting in Corfu at the end of June, at  which Jacques Delors' successor as head of the EU Commission  will be appointed, and the G-7 meeting in Naples at the  beginning of July. The first is an internal affair focused  largely on the running of the EU institutions. The other is an  external matter within the club of the most highly  industrialized countries and involves the establishment of  better conditions for economic development through the inclusion  of a "social clause" [in trade agreements]. This is a full  enough program to justify the Mulhouse consultations.    In view of the preelection debate on the renewal of the  European Parliament, such a summit may seem to be a routine  matter. This would be to forget that European building has only  been able to progress thanks to compromise and that there is no  other means of progressing.    Nothing better illustrates this obvious fact than  Franco-German cooperation. Without it, Europe would already be  a dead idea.</p>

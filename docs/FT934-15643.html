			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Escapes from wider VAT net sought: Industry chiefs are lobbying strongly IF THE imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel is a foregone conclusion, the growing threat that Mr Kenneth Clarke might widen the tax net still further has triggered a wave of intense lobbying to try to warn him off. In the next few weeks the chancellor can expect the usual pre-Budget avalanche of special pleading to hit the Treasury. This year, much of that pleading will be aimed at preventing something which has daily appeared more likely - an extension of VAT to more goods and services. The public will not escape the propaganda either. On buses and trams, at airports and railway stations, in newsagents' and other shops, the battle to fend off VAT is well under way. Sir Bob Reid, British Rail chairman, has already warned Mr John McGregor, transport secretary, that a full VAT rate applied to rail fares would wipe out 10 per cent of rail business. Coming on top of the fare increases already in the pipeline, any further rises would deal a 'massive blow' to the railway system, according to the Central Transport Consultative Committee, the rail users' watchdog. But the committee has been fully occupied fighting privatisation plans and admits that any resources for tackling the VAT issue are strictly limited. The Bus and Coach Council, however, has just stepped up its campaign against VAT on fares, claiming the measure could destroy 1,300 jobs for every 1 percentage point of VAT. It says that imposing the full rate of VAT would raise Pounds 2.3bn in revenue for the Treasury, all of which would be wiped out by the broader economic losses arising from its imposition. The council, which represents operators and manufacturers with a turnover of Pounds 4bn, has sent campaign packs to its 1,200 members and is pinning up posters across the country urging people to 'Fight VAT on fares'. Petitions are being organised and trade unions are being urged by operators to help in the fight. Among the most active campaigners is British Airways, which this weekend began a leaflet campaign at airports across Britain to alert passengers to the danger of higher fares and to enlist their help in fighting it. The airline fears it could lose up to 500,000 passengers if VAT is introduced. Last week BA executives went to the Conservative party conference in Blackpool to buttonhole MPs and ministers and press the airline's case. They pointed out that if VAT is applied at the full rate on air fares, a typical business return fare from London to Glasgow would rise by Pounds 40. They stressed that some corporate customers, such as financial service companies, would not be able to reclaim the tax. BA was not alone in lobbying at Blackpool. Leaders of the Periodical Publishers Association were also present to meet ministers and warn them of the effect on education and literacy of a tax on the printed word - something abandoned in Britain in 1855. The association last week published a special edition of Magazine News devoted to VAT. It has also launched a national advertising campaign to reinforce publishers' claims that imposing the full VAT rate on magazines would cost more than 4,000 jobs and close as many as 1,700 titles. The newspaper industry is mounting its second national campaign in eight years against VAT on newspapers. It has more shock statistics which it hopes will influence the chancellor, although it concedes that the treatment of some politicians and members of the royal family at the hands the press may not exactly help its case for sympathetic treatment. The industry calculates that 245 local and regional papers would close which, it points out, could well deprive some MPs of the most important constituency outlet for their views. The industry has just commissioned a series of articles by politicians setting out the case against VAT on newspapers, which it hopes 1,300 regional and local newspapers will run in the next few weeks. Books, too, are putting up a fight. The National Book Committee, representing authors, booksellers and publishers, says the imposition of VAT would cut book sales by 5 per cent, further increase the problem of poor reading skills, while raising only a 'paltry' Pounds 270m in tax revenue. Mr Tim Godfray, chief executive of the Booksellers Association, says 3,500 sales outlets have been asked to join an anti-VAT campaign, and October 16 has been designated as Books Add Value Day. In spite of the political sensitivities, the prospect of VAT on children's clothes and some food items has not been ruled out. The British Retail Consortium, representing high street traders, will forcefully restate its views to Mr Clarke in person when it meets him later this month. The National Children's Wear Association has been organising a petition for presentation later this month to the prime minister, and the Apparel, Knitting and Textiles Alliance is pressing ministers and MPs to leave children's clothes alone. The overriding need for Mr Clarke to seek new sources of revenue means that all the arguments against the extension of VAT may finally fall on deaf ears. The best chance opponents may have of winning the day may still lie in the government's slim majority and the apparent readiness of some Tory backbenchers to spoil the best-laid plans of their ministers.</p>

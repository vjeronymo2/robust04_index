Professor Kongote Kagna, MPR spokesman, has the details:    [Begin Kagna recording] Steering committee and MPR  parliamentarians held a meeting on 8 January at party  headquarters under the chairmanship of the party's first deputy  chairman, Mr. Banza Moukala Yissoungou. They examined the  current social, economic, and political situation in light of  President Mobutu's 4 January address to the nation. At the end  of the meeting, the steering committee issued the following  statement:    1. The MPR totally endorses President Mobutu's analysis of  the socioeconomic crisis the country is grappling with, which  has been exacerbated by monetary reform problems.    2. On a political level, the MPR urges political leaders not  to hold the Zairian people, who are facing overwhelming misery,  at ransom because of their own personal ambitions. It therefore  calls on political leaders to sign without delay the protocol  agreement and final report on the Palais du Peuple proceedings,  which they negotiated of their own accord. The MPR encourages  the head of state to effectively assume his responsibility  should the political class disqualify themselves, through their  own doing on 12 January, to put an end to the people's misery.    3. The MPR thinks that no democrat should shun free, fair,  and democratic elections, which is why it gives unreserved  support to the holding of elections at all levels to enable the  people to choose their representatives. Finally, the MPR takes  this opportunity to wish the Zairian people happiness and  prosperity for 1994.    Issued: Kinshasa on 8 January.    Signed: (Banza Moukala Yissoungi), first deputy chairman in  charge of coordinating party activities. [end recording]</p>

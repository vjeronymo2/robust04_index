			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Sainsbury in rethink after 'error' over Tesco The J. Sainsbury supermarket chain is to review its policy on the sale of magazines containing advertising coupons for competitors after it was disclosed that store managers were mistakenly asked to remove a Tesco supplement from the Radio Times. The 20-page supplement contained cut-out coupons offering savings on a range of Christmas items. Sainsbury said that its head office had electronically messaged its 353 stores yesterday with an instruction to take out the supplement, but a second message had been sent an hour later cancelling the order. It added: 'The instruction to remove the advertising insert from the Radio Times was an error of judgment. It was speedily rectified.' Sainsbury did not know how many stores had acted on the instruction or how many copies of the magazine were affected. Tesco said it was 'very surprised' at hearing about its rival's action, but it would not take the matter any further.</p>

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Senior sells Davis Derby offshoot Senior Engineering, the tubing, boilers and ductwork group, said yesterday it had sold its Senior Davis Derby offshoot, which makes communications equipment for hazardous environments, to Communication &amp; Control Engineering. The deal, for which terms were not disclosed, comes less than two months after Senior said it would be withdrawing from the mining equipment business due to the contraction of the UK coal industry. The purchase trebles the size of CCE, a private company with 45 employees which specialises in electrical equipment used in environments where fire is a hazard. The combined company will have annual sales of about Pounds 8m.</p>

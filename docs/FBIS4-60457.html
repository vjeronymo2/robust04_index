			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Ala' al-Bahhar] </F>   [Text] The security service departments will launch  wide-scale campaigns over the next two weeks in an attempt to  arrest many members of the militant extremist groups. The  security departments estimate the number of group members at  5,000.    A ranking security official has told AL-SHA'B that in the  next stage the security service will step up armed confrontation  in Asyut. He said a timetable had been drawn up by the interior  ministry to liquidate the leaders of the extremist groups inside  and outside the prisons. He added that the armed confrontation  operations will last for a while. He admitted that the security  service has failed to properly monitor the militant elements  within the extremist groups.    The official said that the interior ministry had covered up  this failure by announcing that 98 leading extremists were  captured even though most of them were detained arbitrarily.  Some of the detainees now in custody of the state security  intelligence will appear on television and in the papers and be  repentant as former members of extremist groups.    The security official added that the announcement on the  latest organization was prompted by the political leadership to  confront the activities of the lawyers association, which is  calling for an investigation into the killing of lawyer  'Abd-al-Harith Madani. The interior ministry has said that  Madani was a link between the Islamic Group's leaders inside and  outside the prisons.</p>

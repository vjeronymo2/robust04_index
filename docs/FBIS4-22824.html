Mironov (deceased), State Scientific Research Institute of  the Chemistry and Technology of Elementoorganic Compounds,  Moscow; UDC 547.235+547.246]    [Abstract] N-(trihalogermylmethyl)-substituted amides,  lactams, and imides are pentacoordinated germanium derivatives  that manifest antineoplastic and immunomodulating neurotropic  properties. A series of experiments were conducted to find  simple methods of synthesizing trichlorogermyl-substituted  amides, lactams, and imides. The experiments confirmed that it  is just as easy to form trichlorogermyl-substituted amides,  lactams, and imides by condensing HGeCl[.sub]3[/] with  compounds containing the fragment NCH[.sub]2[/]Cl as it is to  form the said compounds by reacting HGeCl[.sub]3[/] with  compounds containing the groupings NCH[.sub]2[/]OH and  NCH[.sub]2[/]OH. The yields of the products  RCH[.sub]2[/]GeCl[.sub]3[/] produced during the  experiments reached 70-83 percent, which is 10-25 percent higher  than when the respective N-methylolamide or N-methylolimide is  used. Further studies of the chemical properties of amides,  lactams, and imides with a  Cl[.sub]3[/]GeCH[.sub]2[/]NC(O)-group established that the  phthalamide derivative, unlike previously studied amide and  lactam derivatives, splits upon boiling in concentrated  hydrochloric acid. Next, several never-before-synthesized  tribromo- and triiodogermyl derivatives were produced. In those  cases where the intermediately formed sesquioxanes were water  soluble and difficult to isolate, a new technique was used to  obtain triiodogermyl derivatives, i.e., the effect of  concentrated hydriodic acid directly on the respective  trialkolxygermane. The new compounds were subjected by x-ray  crystallographic and elemental analysis. The newly synthesized  compounds were confirmed to contain a pentacoordinated germanium  atom.

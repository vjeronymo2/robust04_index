			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAPSULE REVIEWS OF TODAY'S AFI FILM FEST  </P> <P> Following are capsule reviews of today's screenings in the American Film  Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival at the Cineplex Odeon Century  Plaza Cinemas:  </P> <P> 'Tribute to the National Film Board of Canada: Oscar Nominated Animated Films'  </P> <P> Canada, 89 minutes  </P> <P> 8:25 p.m.  </P> <P> This second program of NFB shorts showcases experimental and/or multimedia  works: "Christmas Cracker" by Norman McLaren and "Monsieur Pointu" by Bernard  Longpre and Andre LeDuc blend live action with stop-motion animation. Peter  Foldes' "Hunger," the first computer-animated film to be nominated for an  academy award, features ugly line figures utterly unlike the bright,  three-dimensional objects in this year's winner, "Tin Toy. " Ryan Larkin uses  simple ink wash drawings to express an unallayed joy in pure movement in  "Walking." RECOMMENDED. CHARLES SOLOMON  </P></p>

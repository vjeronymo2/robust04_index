			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD;  </P> <P> 5% UTILITY USERS TAX TO BE DEBATED  </P> <P> A proposed 5% utility users tax will be the subject of debate at a televised  public forum May 14 in the Oxnard City Council Chambers.  </P> <P> Measure C, to be decided on the June 5 special municipal election ballot, would  create a 5% utility users tax on businesses and residents for placement in a  general fund to support city services such as police, fire and street  maintenance.  </P> <P> The tax would apply to gas, electric, cable TV and telephone service for  residences, plus water, sewer and trash service for businesses. Proponents  state in election literature that the tax, which would cost most residents  about $4 per month and exclude low-income families, would help make up  reductions in city services caused by budgetary restraints.  </P> <P> Opponents criticize the proposal as a permanent utility tax to solve a  temporary problem. They oppose the tax because the revenues it generates will  be placed in a general fund rather than being directed toward specific city  services, and because it lacks a sunset clause or provision for periodic  review.  </P> <P> The Oxnard Chamber of Commerce has opposed the measure until the completion and  publication of a city operations and management audit.  </P> <P> The forum, to be held at 7:30 p.m., will be televised over channels 6 and 17.

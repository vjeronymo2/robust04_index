			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Western creditors may soon reschedule Russian debt THE PARIS CLUB of western creditors is expected in the next few days to negotiate a much-delayed debt rescheduling with Russia, following an agreement by Ukraine to give up claims on the assets of the former Soviet Union. Ukraine's refusal until now to let Russia, the richest former Soviet republic, keep the assets and assume responsibility for all the liabilities has been the main obstacle to a rescheduling of the former Soviet Union's foreign debt of some Dollars 80bn (Pounds 56bn). But it emerged yesterday that a weekend visit to Kiev by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, the secretary of the Paris Club, together with Ukrainian fears for President Boris Yeltsin's political future, have convinced Ukraine to drop its objections. As part of the deal, Ukraine is to gain space in 36 formerly Soviet, now Russian, embassies worldwide plus parts of the former Soviet Union's Danube and Black Sea merchant fleets. Western governments are anxious to show practical support for Russian reformers before the April 25 referendum, which may determine the country's political and economic direction. They are likely to try to clinch a debt agreement with Russia quickly. A debt rescheduling would open the way for fresh lending. Mr Alexander Shokhin, Russia's deputy prime minister for foreign economic relations, said 'a radical restructuring' of the debt would secure 'an essential breathing-space'. Half the debt is owed to governments, while just over a third is owed to commercial banks and the rest to suppliers. Russia has said it is prepared to pay a total of Dollars 3.5bn to all creditors in 1993. Mr Shokhin said the government intended to work out with creditors of the former Soviet Union 'realistic agreements which would substantially lessen. . . foreign indebtedness'. Mr Jacques Attali, chairman of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, said in Moscow he believed it was 'folly' to ask Russia to pay any of the Soviet debt. He wants western governments to compensate western banks for debts incurred by the Soviet Union. Mr Jean Foglizzo, head of the International Monetary Fund's mission in Russia, said the west faced a 'historic choice' between short-term assistance which was merely a 'derivative of humanitarian aid' and assistance which prompted a 'virtuous circle' of self-generating growth.

			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFTER SLOW START, ELLIOTT FINISHES OFF USC, 97-69;  </P> <P> ARIZONA ALL-AMERICAN MISSES DUNK, THEN GETS HOT, ENDS UP WITH 26 POINTS  </P> <P> Sean Elliott, Arizona's All-American forward, slithered to the basket for an  easy dunk early in the second half of Thursday night's game against USC.  </P> <P> The crowd held its breath in anticipation of an electrifying jam. Would it be a  360-degree reverse? A double pump?  </P> <P> The ball slipped out of Elliott's hands and off the rim. Talk about an  embarrassing moment.  </P> <P> Elliott more than made up for his mistake.  </P> <P> After missing the dunk, Elliott missed just one other shot, scoring 26 points  as the Wildcats defeated the Trojans, 97-69, before 4,387 fans at the Sports  Arena.  </P> <P> After a miserable start in which he missed 6 of 8 shots and scored only 7  points in the first half, Elliott scored 19 points in the second half, hitting  5 of 7 shots, including a 3-pointer.  </P> <P> Elliott also had 8 rebounds, 4 assists and 1 blocked shot in 34 minutes. After  Elliott left the game with 5:52 remaining, the crowd headed for the parking  lot.  </P> <P> Scoring in double figures for the 89th consecutive game, Elliott moved into  second place on the Pac-10 career scoring list, passing UCLA's Reggie Miller.  Elliott has 2,116 points, 210 behind Bruin Lew Alcindor's record of 2,336.  </P> <P> "Elliott is a great player," USC Coach George Raveling said. "We tried to make  him work as hard as he could to make his shots. We tried to wear him down."  </P> <P> The Trojans smothered Elliott with a tenacious defense in the first half,  double-teaming him whenever he touched the ball. It was so rough that Elliott  got a bruise on his forehead. He held an ice bag to his head as he talked to  reporters after the game.  </P> <P> "It was really intense," Elliott said. "They came after me at the beginning of  the first half. I didn't adjust in the second half. I just kept shooting. The  shots I was taking were perfect shots and I figured the law of averages had to  catch up."  </P> <P> Center Anthony Cook, the other half of Arizona's 1-2 punch, scored 23 points  and had 7 rebounds.  </P> <P> Cook also said USC played a physical game, accusing the Trojans of dirty  tactics.  </P> <P> USC center Chris Munk was ejected after getting too physical with Cook with  10:17 left in the second half.  </P> <P> "He (Munk) was throwing a lot of cheap shots. That's why he got ejected," Cook  said. "One time I was taking the ball out of bounds and he grabbed my . . .  </P> <P> "My first reaction was to hit him. Then I got to the bench, and (teammate)  Bryan David said he (Munk) had got him in the same place.  </P> <P> "I don't know where he (Munk) got his schooling from. I've seen people get  dirty, but that's ridiculous."  </P> <P> Munk had a different version of what happened.  </P> <P> Informed of Cook's comment, Munk said: "He said that? I didn't grab him there.  That's bogus. I don't remember anything like that taking place."  </P> <P> Munk said he was ejected for setting an illegal pick on Cook.  </P> <P> "I just stepped up to set a pick and he ran right into me," Munk said. "The ref  made the call he thought was necessary in his eyes, and I can't argue with it."  </P> <P> Raveling said: "I don't think there was anything personal. I didn't see the  play, but the referee was adamant that he (Munk) was out. There wasn't much I  could say. I don't know what happened."  </P> <P> The ninth-ranked Wildcats are 13-2 overall and 7-1 in the Pac-10. After losing  its fifth straight game, USC fell to 7-9 and 0-5.  </P> <P> Although USC stayed with Arizona for the first 16 minutes of the game, rallying  within a point, the Wildcats closed out the first half with a 15-6 spurt and  wound up embarrassing the Trojans.  </P> <P> "I'm puzzled," Raveling said. "In the first half, I thought we played good  basketball except for our foul shooting. In the second half, we looked like we  came out of the locker room and put on different uniforms.  </P> <P> "I'm greatly disappointed that we didn't come out with more enthusiasm in the  second half, particularly since we were playing against a nationally ranked  team."  </P> <P> Forward Ronnie Coleman led USC with 20 points, and Chris Moore added 14. Guard  Anthony Pendleton, USC's leading scorer, had just 4 points. He missed 4 of 5  shots.  </P> <P> Trojan Notes  </P> <P> Sean Elliott said he was rattled by Wednesday night's earthquake. "I almost  slept with my shoes on," he said. "When the earthquake hit, I was ready to jump  off the third-floor balcony. It was like a truck hit the hotel." . . . Laker  General Manager Jerry West and and his assistant, Mitch Kupchak, attended the  game, presumably to scout Elliott.

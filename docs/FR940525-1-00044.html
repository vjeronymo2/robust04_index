(Note: This risk-weighting is in addition to the risk-weighting done to convert the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount to the risk-weighted asset amount under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Related on-balance sheet assets. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  To the extent that an asset is included in the calculation of the capital requirement for a recourse arrangement or direct credit substitute under this paragraph (a)(3), and may also be included as an on-balance sheet asset under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the asset shall be risk-weighted only under this paragraph (a)(3) except:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Excess mortgage servicing rights that are recourse arrangements, and purchased mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships that are direct credit substitutes are risk weighted as on-balance sheet assets under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and the related recourse arrangements and direct credit substitutes are risk weighted under this paragraph (a)(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Purchased subordinated interests that are high quality mortgage-related securities are not subject to risk-weighting under this paragraph (a)(3). Rather, these assets are risk weighted as on-balance sheet assets under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(H) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Limitations on risk-based capital requirement <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(A)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Low-level exposure. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If the maximum contractual liability or exposure to loss retained or assumed by a savings association in connection with a recourse arrangement or direct credit substitute is less than the capital required to support the recourse obligation or direct credit substitute, the capital requirement is limited to the maximum contractual liability or exposure to loss. For assets sold with recourse, the amount of capital required to support the recourse obligation is limited to the maximum contractual liability or exposure to loss less the amount of the recourse liability account established in accordance with GAAP standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mortgage-related securities or participation certificates retained in a mortgage loan swap. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If a savings association holds a mortgage related security or a participation certificate as a result of a mortgage loan swap with recourse, capital is required to support that percentage of the mortgage related security or participation certificate that is not covered by the recourse obligation, and the recourse obligation. The total amount of capital required for the on-balance sheet asset and the recourse obligation, however, is limited to the capital requirement for the underlying loans, calculated as if the savings association continued to hold these loans as an on-balance sheet asset.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Obligations of subsidiaries. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If a savings association retains a recourse arrangement or assumes a direct credit substitute on the obligation of a subsidiary that is not an includable subsidiary and the recourse obligation or direct credit substitute is an equity investment in the subsidiary under GAAP standards, the face amount of the recourse obligation or direct credit substitute is deducted from capital under &sect;&sect;567.5(a)(2) and 567.9(c).

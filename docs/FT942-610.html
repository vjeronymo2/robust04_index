			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Stakes raised again in Bridge Oil bidding war The stakes were raised again yesterday in the hotly-contested bid for Bridge Oil, the Australian oil and gas company, as Texas-based Parker &amp; Parsley raised its terms to 90 cents a share - valuing Bridge Oil at ADollars 378m (USDollars 277.9m) - and snared almost one-fifth of its target's shares. But Gantry Acquisition Corporation, the rival bidder which is offering 85 cents a share, quickly stressed that it was not out of the race. 'We're still very much in the game and considering our response,' said Mr Gene Humphrey, Gantry's president. Gantry is the bid vehicle for Joint Energy Development Investments, an investment partnership owned jointly by Enron, the North American gas company, and the California Public Employees' Retirement System, one of the largest public-sector pension funds in the US. P&amp;P, which opened the bidding with an offer of 70 cents a share in cash last month and had already raised that to 80 cents, said it was adding a further 10 cents to its price as the markets opened. No sooner had these new terms been announced, than Prudential-Bache Securities, acting for P&amp;P, said it would buy in the market at the revised offer level. By the close of business, the bidder's interest had increased to 19.4 per cent of Bridge's equity, compared with just over 4 per cent previously. Mr Herb Williamson, executive vice-president of Parker &amp; Parsley, said he believed the new offer was 'a compelling bid'. News of the higher offer from the Texan oil independent prompted the Bridge Oil board to switch its allegiance. Having previously recommended the 85 cents a share offer from Gantry, directors said they were now supporting the new bid from Parker - in the absence of any further higher offer. Aside from price, the two bids differ in that P&amp;P has said it will retain Bridge's Australian assets, whereas Gantry has suggested that it is interested primarily in Bridge's US operations and would expect to dispose of the Australian operations. Grocery wholesaler Foodland Associated plans to refinance all banking facilities within the group by the end of October, Reuter reports. Foodland, the target of a ADollars 501m takeover offer by New Zealand's Rank Commercial and Coles Myer of Australia, said the refinancing would be undertaken on the basis of a common borrowing and security structure. The company said it expected to require core debt facilities of around ADollars 250m. All current lenders would be offered an opportunity to participate in the refinancing, Foodland said.</p>

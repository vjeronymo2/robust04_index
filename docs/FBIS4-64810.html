			<p>BFN     [Text] Replying to new remarks by Albanian President Sali  Berisha, government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today asked  for respect for international law regulations regarding the  Greek minority's human rights in Albania.    In an interview, Berisha again attacked our country and  called on it to choose between the European or Byzantine trend  which, he said, prevails in our country.    Venizelos said that the European trend primarily means  respect for the principles of a state of justice, respect for  human rights and of course respect for the rights of the Greek  minority in Albania. Beyond that, said Venizelos, I do not  think that many strongly worded statements help to cultivate  good relations between the two countries. The good relations,  he continued, definitely depend on respect for the rules I  mentioned above.</p>

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / People: Beecham's Boyle moves to BUPA David Boyle, a 28-year veteran of Beecham, is moving to take charge of the international division of BUPA. He becomes one of three managing directors on the board of Britain's largest private healthcare group, all reporting to chief executive Peter Jacobs. BUPA covers around 854,000 people on the international side, with a turnover in 1991 of Pounds 178m. The organisation, which has seen falling income as premiums and costs have shot up in Britain, says that premium increases on the international side, at an average of 15 per cent, have kept pace with the costs of health care and that the number of people covered by the division rose slightly in 1992 compared with the previous year. His most recent assignment at SmithKline Beecham was a four-year stint as chairman of consumer brands, European division, a position two levels down from the main board of the Anglo-American company. Previously, he had travelled widely in various capacities and had lived in Kuala Lumpur in the mid 1970s as the regional managing director of Beecham products, Far East. Why is he coming to BUPA? 'The main reason,' says Boyle, 50, 'is that after 28 years it is stimulating and refreshing to make a move.' He adds that there are many similarities between the two jobs: 'On the insurance side, after all, BUPA is simply providing a consumer product.' BUPA has a significant toehold in the Spanish market via its subsidiary Sanitas, as well as activities in Hong Kong, Malta and Cyprus. Boyle says part of his brief will be to extend the regional coverage, but will not be drawn further. Boyle replaces David Shaw, who had headed international for two and a half years, and who is retiring after 23 years with BUPA. ***** Queens Moat Houses, the UK-based hotel group with a large European presence and even bigger ambitions, has appointed two of its continental executives to the main board. The two new directors are Peter Bertholdt, 47, who is responsible for the group's operations in Germany, Austria and Switzerland and Leonardus van der Meer, 49, who heads the business in the Netherlands and Belgium. Queens Moat has more hotel rooms outside the UK than in. John Bairstow, the chairman, said last year that the Continent would become even more important to the group. He said that 'the UK will progressively become one of our major areas of operation, rather than the mainstay of our business'; the two new board members had played a central role in establishing Queens Moat on the Continent. ***** Ian Fraser, md of Reliance Security Services, is also appointed md of RELIANCE SECURITY GROUP; he replaces Peter Paice who is leaving to pursue other interests. ***** Sean Lance and Neil Maidment have been appointed mds at GLAXO HOLDINGS and on to the main board. ***** Graham McVey, formerly a director of Reed International and chairman and chief executive of the Reed Business Publishing Group, has been appointed chief executive of FINDLAY PUBLICATIONS. ***** Mike Rodwell has been promoted to become md of SCHINDLER Ltd, the UK subsidiary of the Swiss group. ***** Edward Lowndes, 49, has been appointed as the first full-time general secretary of the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency. SPI, a professional body founded two years ago for the UK's more than 2,000 insolvency practitioners, has been increasingly active as the subject has come under the spotlight during the recession. It does not license professionals, but has issued a series of ethical guidelines and practice notes, lobbied the government and is developing a network of regional societies. Lowndes was formerly the director of resources for the paymaster in chief of the army, and recently left on completion of his contract, with the rank of colonel. He is a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants, and was once finance officer to the Sultan of Brunei's armed forces. ***** Christopher Heard, md of Mortgage Trust, has been appointed chairman of the ASSOCIATION OF MORTGAGE LENDERS.</p>

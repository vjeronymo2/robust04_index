			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Gao Jinan: "Officials Introduce </F> Ecological Agriculture"]    [Text] The government yesterday introduced a large-scale  ecological project to integrate agricultural development and  environmental protection.    The project, given high priority by the State Council, is  considered a vital move in stemming deterioration of the rural  environment, reducing natural disasters and promoting sustained  development of an "ecological agriculture," according to State  Councillor Chen Junsheng.    The undertaking is a joint endeavor among the departments of  forestry, environment protection, water conservancy and  agriculture, Chen told a national conference yesterday.    The State councilor urged governments at all level to  consider rural ecology, an issue he said has been insufficiently  weighted in the development of agriculture and rural economy.    Chen said he hoped that departments like forestry, water  resources, planning, finance and sciences would co-ordinate  their efforts in implementing the project.    The Ministry of Agriculture and six other ministries  launched  the plan yesterday by designating 50 counties as ecological  agricultural-development centres.    Starting in 1980, China has introduced  experimental-environmental projects in about 1,000 villages,  townships and counties.    According to Vice-Agricultural Minister Hong Fuzeng, about  200 counties, with a total area of some 14 million hectares of  farmland, will be developed as ecological-agriculture projects  by the year 2,000.    China feeds 22 percent of the world's population with only 7  per cent of its farmland.    Hong said the worsening agricultural ecology should be  controlled as soon as possible.    Because of population growth and industrial production,  466,700 to 533,300 hectares of farmland are occupied annually by  urban, industrial, mining and transportation projects.    "We have to face the challenges and explore ways to develop  agriculture while protecting the environment," Hong said.    He suggested that the ecological development of agriculture,  forestry, animal husbandry, sidelines and fishery should be  coordinated to ensure a balanced increase in output.    While reducing pollution caused by cities, industries and  township enterprises, the utilization of fertilizers, chemical  pesticides and plastic sheet in the rural areas should also be  tempered, he said.</p>

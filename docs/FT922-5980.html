			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Brussels sees lower real growth in Europe THE European Commission yesterday revised downwards to 1.75 per cent its estimate of this year's real growth in the European economy from the 2.3 per cent it predicted six months ago. At the same time, it predicted a further rise in the Community's unemployment rate from 9.5 per cent this year to 9.75 per cent in 1993. The Commission said the slower-than-expected recovery in the European economy - already reflected in similar forecasts by other international organisations - would have consequences for EC states' efforts to meet the 'convergence' criteria, set in the Maastricht treaty, for eventual monetary union. The Commission believes average EC inflation will come down from 5.2 per cent in 1991 to 4.5 per cent this year, but adds that 'greater progress might reasonably have been expected given the tight stance of monetary policy and depressed economic activity'. By 1993 the average should fall to 4 per cent, it says. This will put the UK, and the seven countries which have kept their currencies within the exchange rate mechanism's narrow band, within 1.5 percentage points of the three least inflationary economies - one of the Maastricht convergence tests. But slack growth will also push up net government borrowing from 4.3 per cent of Community gross domestic product to an average of 4.75 per cent this year, where it will stay in 1993. Maastricht set as a goal - though not an absolute requirement - for monetary union that countries should keep their borrowing to within 3 per cent of GDP. Only Denmark, France, Ireland and Luxembourg will pass this test in 1993, though the first stab at monetary union is not due until the end of 1996. The sharpest deterioration is expected in the UK, whose public deficit is expected to rise by more than three percentage points over 1991 to 1993 to 5.25 per cent. Germany's budget deficit, which is causing its partners such concern because of its knock-on effect on their interest rates, is forecast to rise half a percentage point to 3.25 per cent this year, with a slight fall expected next year. The recent tail-off in the creation of new jobs will end next year, the Commission believes, but this will not be enough to prevent the overall jobless rate rising next year.</p>

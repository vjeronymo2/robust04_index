			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / UK Company News: National Express offer twice subscribed THE OFFER for sale of shares in National Express, the biggest scheduled coach service operator in the UK, was more than twice subscribed, it was announced yesterday. This means only applications for 250 shares will be met in full. Others will be scaled down - in the case of the largest ones, to a third or less of the number of shares requested. The total number of shares sold in the flotation was 27.8m, of which 75 per cent was placed at 165p per share with institutional investors and the remainder offered for sale. Valid applications were received for 14.7m shares, but with only 6.9m available in the public offering, the result is a heavy scaling-down. The allocation was as follows: for 250 shares - in full; for 500 shares - 75 per cent; between 600 and 1,000 - 65 per cent; between 1,500 and 5,000 - 50 per cent; 6,000 to 10,000 - 45 per cent; 15,000 to 100,000 - 40 per cent; 120,000 to 150,000 - 34 per cent; 180,000 to 500,000 - 33 per cent; for more than 500,000 the allocation will be about 29 per cent. Advisers to National Express will be hoping that large investors left short of stock because of the rationing will top up in the after-market, so leading to a premium when dealings begin on December 10. Morgan Grenfell is sponsor to the issue, with Smith New Court as broker.</p>

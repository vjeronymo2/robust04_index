			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Paul Montgomery] </F>   [Text] Brussels, February 14 (BTA) -- With all the  solemnity of the occasion, President Zhelev signed the document  at NATO headquarters this afternoon that will enter Bulgaria  into the Partnership for Peace.    "It went well," said the president in an exclusive interview  at the end of his flying visit to Brussels. He spoke to the  local representative of BTA in very good English at the  luxurious villa of Ambassador Leah Cohen, before he caught the  airplane back to Sofia.    "I'm satisfied, I'm happy, I think it was a good thing for  Bulgaria, for its national security in the long run. There will  be a gradual integration of Bulgaria into the European  structure," President Zhelev said.    At NATO headquarters, Zhelev met with the deputy secretary  general, Sergio Balanzino, because the secretary general,  Manfred Woerner, has had three operations for cancer in the last  year and is still recovering from the last one. The agreement  Zhelev signed is the standard form admitting Bulgaria to the  process of association without full membership. It has already  been signed by the leaders of Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania,  Poland, Romania, Ukraine and Slovakia. Bulgaria was thus the  eighth country to sign, later the same afternoon Latvia became  the ninth.    At a news conference later at Ambassador Cohen's villa in  the  richest part of Brussels, with the local police waiting outside  in the tree-lined streets on motorcycles to escort his limousine  to the airport for the airplane home, Zhelev was pressed about  the situation in Bosnia. He called the NATO threats to attack  Serbian artillery around Sarajevo an "act of peace" and  expressed the hope that it would have a sobering effect on the  combatants.    When he had a brief glass of Bulgarian wine before getting  into his limousine, the BTA correspondent asked him about the  political situation in Bulgaria. He said he thought there would  be elections at the end of this year. Asked if there would be a  coalition with the Turkish political interests, Zhelev said it  was too early to tell.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis expressed the  conviction that the UN secretary general's report to the  Security Council on the talks on the confidence-building  measures will record the events as they are and call a spade a  spade. The president made this statement this evening at the  presidential palace before his departure for South Africa to  attend the inauguration of Nelson Mandela, the first  democratically elected president and the first multiracial  government of that country. Correspondent Dhimitrios Andreou  has the following report.    [Begin recording] [Andreou] President Kliridhis described  the elections in South Africa and the abolition of racial  discrimination as a historic event. We should all, he stressed,  honor Nelson Mandela for his struggles. President Kliridhis  however, will go to South Africa....    [Kliridhis] I will also go for another reason, because in  this country there is a large Cypriot immigrant community and of  course a Greek immigrant community. In the last two days I am  there, I will be with the immigrants because they have asked for  it, they have prepared an agenda....    [Andreou] President Kliridhis was asked about the Cyprus  issue, what he expects from the secretary general and his report  to the Security Council, the alternative ways that the Security  Council should adopt in order to promote a solution of the  Cyprus issue. Every time a phase concludes, irrespective of its  result, and before the secretary general submits his report to  the Security Council, the Americans and British mobilize to  alter the contents of this report. What information do you have  regarding the current period and how is the government reacting?    [Kliridhis] The information we have is that Robert Lamb, the  U.S. Government's coordinator on the Cyprus issue, will meet Mr.  Ulucevic [Turkish state minister on Cyprus] in Vienna. The  third country reportedly involved is not London but Vienna. We  have information that Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary  general's representative, will also be there. Supposedly, the  reason for their trip, is to convince Mr. Ulucevic to convince  [Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf] Denktas to accept the document  that has been submitted. The evaluations I hear from various  sides are that there are no possibilities for a change in the  Turkish position. My estimate is that it is a waste of time,  but since Mr. Lamb thinks there are still possibilities, perhaps  it would be a mistake for this meeting not to take place. What  the Cyprus Government insists on, and which appears to be  accepted, is that without any delay, the UN secretary general's  report should be submitted right after 15 May, and that this  report should call a spade a spade. I believe that there is  another aspect which is gaining substantial ground, and this is  Europe's understanding that the Turkish side does not have  goodwill to promote a solution to the Cyprus issue, either on  the substance or the confidence-building measures, and that  Denktas' basic aim is to gain time in hopes that he will achieve  recognition of the Turkish Cypriot pseudostate. I also want to  stress that those who promote the position that the  confidence-building measures should be abandoned and that we  should return to the substance of the Cyprus issue are helping  the Turkish side. The correct position is that there can be  progress neither on the substance nor on the confidence-building  measures. Progress can only be achieved when the Security  Council does what it said in its resolutions, that is, study and  suggest alternative ways for implementation of the resolutions.  [end recording]</p>

			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / FT Satellite Monitor: Over 3m homes get multi-channel TV BETWEEN 3m and 3.4m homes in the UK now have access to satellite television, four years after the launch of Sky Television, the final FT Satellite Monitor shows. To mark the 48th and last monthly monitor Continental Research, which produces it, commissioned two other market research organisations, NOP and RSGB, to conduct separate surveys of the size of the satellite market. More than 10,000 interviews were conducted - more than 13,000 if regular interviewing carried out by BARB, the official television audience organisation, is included. In 4,000 telephone interviews last month Continental found that 3.33m households were receiving satellite television channels by dish, cable or communal aerial systems. The RSGB figure from 4,000 face-to-face interviews was 3.37m, and NOP came up with a total of 2.99m based on 2,000 telephone interviews. BARB's 3,500 face-to-face interviews produced a total of 3.15m. Continental believes that the best estimate for the total number of homes which can receive the new channels is 3.24m. This adds up to more than 9m individuals aged 4 or over, or 17 per cent of the UK population. Continental has decided to stop publishing monthly changes in the number of satellite homes because it has become more difficult to measure the figures accurately as the market has grown. Mr John Clemens, chairman of Continental Research, said yesterday: 'This leads to unnecessary controversy about the level of satellite TV penetration, with the monthly differences (with other market research groups) being the result of a mix of different definitions and sampling error.' Continental will continue to research the number of homes receiving satellite TV and will publish regular reports. Its first forecast published in 1988 suggested that there would be 4m satellite homes by the end of last year. It now believed that the 4m figure would be reached by the end of this year and that by the 2000 homes receiving satellite channels would have risen to 9.5m or just over 40 per cent. The research group has a data base of 200,000 interviews. They show that satellite television is mainly geared to 'young large families in the mass market'. The market profile shows that 37 per cent of satellite homes come from the ABC1 social groups, professional and managerial. Skilled workers, the C2Ds, make up 56 per cent and the poorest and oldest, the Es, 7 per cent. One in 10 adults says he or she intends to install a dish. Meanwhile GfK, the marketing services group, today publishes its latest estimate of the satellite dish market. GfK, which is sponsored by the ITV Association, estimates that on February 20 a total of 2.098m satellite dishes had been installed. This represented an increase of 39,000 since its estimate a month ago. The GfK survey does not include distribution of satellite channels by cable, and Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands are excluded. The market research group has also carried out work on 'churn' - those who get rid of their satellite dishes. Churn totalled 78,000 dishes in the first half of last year, rising to 142,000 in the second half. GfK believes between 40 per cent and 50 per cent of those who had BSB Squarials did not install an Astra dish to continue receiving satellite television.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report A higher than expected rise in the April US Producer Price index helped to steady London GOLD and SILVER prices and lift early Comex prices. Gold bounced from an early dip on good physical business in London, dealers said. The market was still digesting the recent Goldsmith Newmont Mining shares sale and awaiting the return of physical demand, dealers said. COPPER continued to rally away from recent 5 1/2 -year lows on the LME, with sentiment becoming slightly more positive when the technical rally lifted three-month metal above Dollars 1,820 a tonne. Three-month NICKEL fell below Dollars 6,000 a tonne. Dealers said the LME's warning over the November-December premium had taken some of the steam out of the market, although a Dollars 10-Dollars 30 backwardation remained in place. New York ORANGE JUICE futures were sharply higher at midday, spurred mostly by speculative buying. The market is still strong technically, one analyst said, pegging resistance at the 105 cents for the July contract. Traders were waiting for the latest 1993-94 Brazilian crop estimate.

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of International Equity Offerings (7): Nordic profile raised - A look at the global impact Several big privatisations and corporate share issues have been launched in the Nordic region this year, many of them targeted not just at domestic investors but at the global investment community. The process has helped to raise the international profile of a number of the region's big companies - some have used it as an opportunity to gain a listing overseas - and it has further increased the levels of foreign ownership in Nordic stocks. The relatively small size of the Nordic region's domestic markets is one reason why most of the large share offerings involve a sizeable international element. A good example was the Danish government's sale of nearly 50 per cent of Tele Danmark for DKr19.5bn in April - the biggest share offering in the region this year. Of the 63m shares on offer, only 18 per cent were sold in Denmark, while 41 per cent were placed in the US and 41 per cent in the rest of the world. Tele Danmark gained a simultaneous listing in Copenhagen and New York in April and is now the second largest group on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. Most of the region's big share issues in 1994 have been prompted by government privatisation programmes, with Sweden, the region's largest economy, proving the most active. In June the Swedish government sold a 45.8 per cent stake in Pharmacia, one of the world's top 20 pharmaceuticals companies with annual sales of SKr27bn. The issue, directed at both the domestic and international markets, raised more than SKr9bn, leaving the state with just 14 per cent of the capital and 11.7 per cent of the votes in the company. Pharmacia was the single largest sale in a privatisation programme which has raised SKr23bn (Pounds 2bn) for the Swedish state since it was unveiled by the centre-right government in 1991. Another big disposal came earlier this year when the government raised SKr7.6bn from the sale of a 49 per cent stake in AssiDoman, one of Europe's 10 largest forestry groups. The government also sold a 24 per cent holding in OK Petroleum, the Nordic region's biggest oil refiner, to a Saudi Arabian buyer in March. Whether the Swedish privatisation process goes much further is unclear after this week's general election, which returned the Social Democrats to power, but as a minority government. The Social Democrats have in effect ruled out a privatisation of Vattenfall, the power group, and have been ambiguous about whether they will sell off Telia, the telecommunications concern. Both these companies would have been on the centre-right government's privatisation list. However, there is a broad consensus behind plans to return Nordbanken to the private sector in a sell-off which will probably take place next year. Nordbanken collapsed into state arms under the weight of huge loan losses in 1992 and has since been merged with Gota Bank, which was also taken over by the state, in preparation for the sale. The country's largest bank in terms of market share, Nordbanken has made a controversial return to profit after many of its problem loans were siphoned off into a separate entity. In Norway, too, the process of returning state-owned banks to the private sector has begun. Den norske Bank and Christiania Bank, the two largest banks, have carried out NKr2bn international share offerings in recent months, reducing state ownership to 72.5 and 69 per cent respectively. The government intends to reduce the state's holding in both banks to 50 per cent by the end of 1997. Finland also has a privatisation programme but has proceeded cautiously, gradually widening ownership in companies rather than moving dramatically below 51 per cent control. This year the state reduced its stake in Outokumpu (mining), Valmet (paper machinery) and Rautaruukki (steel), and it is lining up an initial public offering for Kemira, the state-owned chemicals group, for the autumn or early 1995. Unusually, the proceeds from the disposals are not being garnered by the state, but are being used to strengthen the companies' own balance sheets. Outside the privatisation sphere, there have also been some hefty share offerings. Nokia, the Finnish telecommunications group, raised FM2.5bn during the summer in the country's largest-ever international share issue. The move, to support the group's fast-growing mobile phones business, was accompanied by a listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Meanwhile in Norway, Norsk Hydro, the energy and fertilisers group, raised NKr4.7bn through a rights issue. Proceeds are to be used to reduce debt, finance expansion and invest in new North Sea oil and pipeline projects. The autumn agenda looks relatively quiet, possibly because of uncertainties linked to EU referendums in Finland, Sweden and Norway. However, ISS, the Danish industrial cleaning group, has announced plans to issue 3m shares on the New York Stock Exchange, while in Sweden, Stadshypotek, the country's largest mortgage credit institute, is to demutualise and issue SKr3bn worth of new shares.</p>

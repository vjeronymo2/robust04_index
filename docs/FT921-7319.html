			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / BCCI: A 'market' rate of Pounds 127 an hour and Concorde flights THE CALM face of Mr Brian Smouha tensed just slightly yesterday at the mention of the fees Touche Ross has charged for its liquidation work on BCCI. When Touche revealed at a court hearing in January that the bills had reached Pounds 75m, it provoked a storm of indignant criticism. Only after the announcement of the settlement was the firm willing to say anything more. Yesterday it made up for the silence by releasing a great deal of detail, including a three-page document showing Mr Smouha's daily itinerary from July 5 last year to February 11 this year. He readily admitted that he had flown by Concorde during the course of his work. His schedule shows journeys in quick succession between London, the US, Luxembourg and the Gulf. 'It was a question of survival,' he said. 'I was trying to be in more than one place at the same time, and in a state to do the work. It's not easy trying to organise something with meetings in New York, the Caymans, Abu Dhabi.' He also agreed that his staff based in Abu Dhabi had flown to holiday destinations periodically, and one man had flown back to the UK to visit his pregnant wife. 'Most people in Abu Dhabi were working 12-hour days, six days a week,' he said. 'You need to keep people performing at the highest level they can.' Without holidays, he said, 'you start getting a very poor product very quickly'. At current exchange rates, bills for the liquidation until January 6 shown to the Financial Times amount to Pounds 77.4m. That includes legal fees of Pounds 12.8m, VAT of Pounds 4.8m and agents and security charges of Pounds 3.5m. Wages of BCCI employees, rent and other expenses came to Pounds 16.6m. However, Pounds 39.7m or 51 per cent of the total is for work conducted by Touche, which at the peak had 330 UK staff working on BCCI. It says it had charged 281,062 hours in the UK on the worldwide liquidation by January 15 at an average rate of Pounds 127 per hour, which amounts to Pounds 35.7m. The rest appears to be expenses or overseas fees. 'We used what I think are the market, commercial rates,' said Mr Smouha. 'We used the best quality of people and not just anyone who was available.' He said he was trying to reduce the hours charged on BCCI work as fast as possible and hoped soon to cut the number of staff substantially. But he said work to date had required a great deal of staff time dealing with thousands of creditors and depositors and continuing to run the bank. Mr Smouha said that the court had provisionally approved the fees charged.</p>

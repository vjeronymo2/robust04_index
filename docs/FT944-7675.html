			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Survey of Mexico (7): Foreign banking competition intensifies - Customer service in domestic banks has improved significantly Mexico's richest businessmen may now be regretting the Dollars 12.4bn they paid for the country's 18 formerly state-owned banks. In the two to three years since the banks were privatised, the market value of most has fallen in real terms, with profits and asset quality affected by the lower than expected economic growth, and higher than expected interest rates. The economic climate appears to be improving - growth is picking up and loan-default rates have stabilised - but the banks now face the challenge of increased foreign and domestic competition. In October, the government authorised foreigners to open up five financial groups, 18 banks, 16 brokerages, and 12 insurance companies, to compete alongside 54 domestic institutions, 36 of which have been set up since the privatisations. The recent problems in the financial sector have been caused mainly by the generous lending in the early 1990s and subsequent deterioration in Mexico's economy. Bank lending increased in the early 1990s by more than 20 times the growth in GDP as the government deregulated the financial sector and interest rates fell; once the economy deteriorated, and interest rates rose, many companies which had over-borrowed were unable to meet their interest payments and defaulted on their loans. The ratio of past-due loans to total loans has grown from 4.12 per cent in 1991 to 8.3 per cent at the end of September. Banks have been forced to put aside provisions for the non-performing loans, reducing their profits. The poor quality of their credit has required them to maintain high margins on lending to cover for the chance of default, putting further pressure on Mexican companies. Moody's, the rating agency, in a recent report, put most of the blame of the current situation on the banks' poor information systems and weak management. 'The system's ability to adjust to a liberalised banking environment has been hindered by a lack of experienced managers, poor borrower disclosure, a lack of strong credit culture, the paucity of credit bureaux and close links with concentrated industrial sectors,' concluded the rating agency. The downturn in the sector has co-incided with two banking scandals that have highlighted the government's inadequate financial regulation. This year the finance ministry took over Grupo Financiero Havre - an insurance, leasing and brokerage company - and Grupo Financiero Cremi-Union, one of Mexico's largest banks. The top managers of Havre and Union are both accused of illegally channelling loans to their own business interests. The finance ministry has subsequently prepared new regulations that will require auditors and external directors to play a more active role in scrutinising operations of their companies, and encourage the formation of institutions to rate the credit worthiness of domestic banks. New rules forcing banks to assess their exposure to market-risks - such as interest rates or devaluation - have also been announced. At the same time, largely in response to increasing competition in the sector, Mexican banks have sought to improve efficiency and the ability to control credit risks by shedding workers, and investing in new computer systems. Client service in domestic banks has also improved significantly, with average waiting lines at most counters reduced significantly. GF Bancomer, Mexico's second largest financial institution, has, for example, employed UK consultants, Proudfoot, to re-engineer the way its commercial bank goes about its business. Mr Hector Rangel, deputy chief executive, says the total restructuring of operations has enabled it to cut personnel - mainly among middle management  -by 30 per cent without sacrificing customer services. Once redundancy payments have been made, GF Bancomer expects costs to fall sharply. Foreign institutions are meanwhile expected to put additional competitive pressure on domestic financial groups, although given the initial limits on their capitalisation, the impact of their presence in Mexico will only be felt over the long-term. Initially, foreigners will account for 6.25 per cent of the banking sector's market capitalisation  - the legal ceiling for 1994 is 8 per cent - and 10 per cent of the brokerage's market capitalisation. Under the opening, foreign brokerages will for the first time be able to execute orders in the stock market for foreign clients, and thus will no longer having to pay commissions to Mexican houses. This may eventually contribute to a lowering of overall commissions, as Mexicans compete harder to keep foreign business. In the banking sector, foreigners are expected to concentrate on capital markets activities, and on corporate finance for blue-chip corporate companies, where competition is already intense. However, analysts expect the foreign presence in the blue-chip corporate segment of the banking market to have a trickle-down effect, as Mexican banks respond by increasing lending to less well-known medium and small-sized companies, where margins are higher, and their competitive advantages greater. 'The broadening and deepening of Mexico's domestic money and capital markets will, over time, lead to a more efficient allocation of credit across the board and reduction in the cost of capital,' says Roberto Mendoza, vice-chairman of JP Morgan, one of five foreign institutions to have been granted approval to set up a financial group. 'As competition grows, participants in the market will be forced to play to their strengths,' he says. The large number of foreign institutions - and the tens of millions of dollars that each will be investing in Mexico - has raised questions about whether all of them will prosper. Much will depend on the economic growth. But drawing lessons from the financial institutions that prospered after London's Big Bang, Mr Mendoza says that those which already do a lot of business with Mexico will be best-placed to succeed.</p>

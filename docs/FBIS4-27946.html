			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Overhauling Thai Politics Towards Reforms"] </F>   [Text] There has been growing support for the call that a  constitution drafting committee be established to write a new  constitution as a way to end the current crisis sparked by the  hunger strike by Pilot Officer Chalat Worachat since 25 May.  The option was suggested by senior citizen Doctor Prawet Wasi,  and backed by Senate President Michai Ruchuphan, a  national-level expert on legal affairs, who confirmed that a  constitution drafting council could be set up through the  amendment to Article 211 of the Constitution.    It is possible to set up a constitution drafting council and  implement political reforms in Thailand if members of the  parliament unanimously push for an amendment to Article 211 in  order that a "constitution drafting council" be set up,  comprised of not more than 100 members to be appointed by the  king. Ten of them will represent the House of Representatives;  five come from the Senate; and the rest will be picked up from  the lists proposed to the House of Representatives and the  Senate by the various groups and organizations. They will  represent people from all walks of life.    The government should not look at the protest by Chalat  Worachat as an individual matter. By nature, it is part of the  nation's problem which is caused by a flaw in the political  structure -- the people are unhappy with certain existing rules,  which block the development towards social justice. So long as  we allow this to continue, there will always be a risk of more  crises. The government of Prime Minister Chuan Likphai, which  controls the majority in the House of Representatives, should  therefore listen to the people and push for political reforms.  This will be tantamount to overhauling Thailand's political  structure, making it more up-to- date and responsive to  democratic development.    We no longer consider the hunger strike by Chalat Worachat  an  individual matter since it has alarmingly created ideological  rifts and divisions in the country. Some people already look at  it as a national crisis. Political reforms, therefore, should  be an option to save the country and also the life of Chalat  Worachat. There are those who stick to the principle of  legality to the point of overlooking the intention of legal  principles; they stick too much to the letter. This group of  people think that Chalat Worachat is alone in his struggle, and  therefore they do not pay attention to whether Chalat will  survive or die.    Although we never approved Chalat's tactic of pressure from  the past, we, at this point, think that political reforms are  urgently needed. There is nothing wrong with overhauling  political rules and regulations. The administration can perform  its work under the present constitution until the new  constitution is completed.    This, however, will be made possible only when members of  the  parliament unanimously work for it. The Democrat Party, which  controls the majority of the parliament and which serves as the  core of the government coalition, especially should step out and  take the role of leader in the campaign, instead of standing  with its back to the wall, sticking to written principle, and  looking at an impasse or a national crisis, which is not good at  all. If the prime minister, who is leader of the Democrat  Party, insists upon sticking to his principle, out of pride or  any other reasons, we would like to call upon other members of  the Democrat Party to freely use their good judgment and join  other political parties in support of the campaign to achieve  political reforms.</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / International Company News: Lyonnaise des Eaux sees gains Lyonnaise des Eaux, the French utilities and construction group, will show a 'significant' rise in profits from last year's modest FFr804m (Dollars 141m), Mr Jerome Monod, president, forecast yesterday. Irrespective of the slight recovery in the French economy this year, Mr Monod told shareholders the group's aim was to increase its business abroad to 60 per cent of its turnover in the next five years, from 42 per cent. The company hopes to win the contract for France's third mobile phone network, in spite of competition from two rival consortia. Havas, the French media group, said it will invest FFr765m to raise its stake in Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion (CLT), the Luxembourg broadcaster, to 20.4 per cent from 15.9 per cent, under a new deal with Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (GBL), Reuter adds from Paris. Belgian holding companies GBL, Electrafina, and Havas have reshuffled their interest in Audiofina, the media holding company that controls CLT, GBL said earlier. A new company, notionally called Newco, 60 per cent controlled by GBL and Electrafina, and 40 per cent by Havas, will now group their stakes in Audiofina.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 11 (AFP)--French group Aerospatiale,  main constructor of the Ariane rocket, wants to develop  satellite cooperation with China, its chairman Louis Gallois  said here Wednesday.    He told a press conference that an Aerospatiale technical  team will arrive in Beijing within the next few days to study  areas for space cooperation, particularly for satellites.    Although China's Long March rocket launcher is a direct  competitor to Ariane "we need to work with China and have  technical exchanges," he added.    Gallois said his group's presence in China did not reflect  the company's position in Asia where it sold 35 percent of its  exports.    China had bought only 43 Airbus aircraft, manufactured by  the  European consortium in which the French group is a partner,  compared with 90 McDonnell Douglas planes and 225 Boeings, its  U.S. rivals.    He said "we must increase our presence in China and the aim  of this trip is to assure the Chinese authorities that we want  to invest long-term in this country."    Aerospatiale, active in both civilian and military spheres,  has an annual turnover of around nine billion dollars, 70  percent from exports.    It controls two thirds of Arianespace, has a 38 percent  stake  in Airbus and 50 percent in a Franco-Italian regional transport  plane ATR. The group also manufactures helicopters and tactical  and ballistic missiles.    Gallois said the turbo-prop ATR-42 was particularly suited  for regional operations and ideal for a country like China. He  said 150 ATR models had been sold in the United States. A key  part for the plane is already being manufactured under licence  in Xian, northern China, he said.    In cooperation with a factory in Harbin, northeast China,  the  group was also developing a light helicopter -- the EC 120. The  factory has been manufacturing the Dauphin helicopter under  licence for several years and has sold more than 100 models in  China.    Gallois said Aerospatiale was also ready to offer training  to  Chinese civilian pilots and "possibly" to military pilots.</p>

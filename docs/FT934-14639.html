			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / New products help Chrysler to record SHARES in Chrysler, the US car giant, surged by Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 51 3/4 yesterday as strong sales growth took third-quarter earnings to a record Dollars 423m (Pounds 280m) - more than double the Dollars 202m for the comparable period last year. The profits increase was helped by exceptional gains of Dollars 58m from the sale of Chrysler's remaining 23.3m shares in Mitsubishi Motors, the Japanese car company, and a favourable tax adjustment of Dollars 51m. But the figures also included a Dollars 79m charge for the restructuring of the group's car rental operations. Chrysler's healthy performance reflects continuing recovery from a position of financial weakness two years ago. Earlier this month the company regained its investment-grade debt rating from Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency. Chrysler has increased market share and profits by switching from the dull, boxy cars it produced in the 1980s to more imaginative designs with higher margins, such as sports utility vehicles and minivans. Mr Robert Eaton, chairman, said a combination of new vehicles such as the Jeep Grand Cherokee, Dodge Intrepid, Chrysler Concorde and Eagle Vision had combined with continued dominance of the minivan market to improve the sales mix. Turnover for the quarter was a record Dollars 9.7bn, up 5.4 per cent. Earnings per common share were Dollars 1.13, compared with 62 cents. Retail sales in the quarter totalled 220,922 cars and 309,979 trucks and minivans in the US and Canada, giving the group 9.4 per cent of the car market and 20.2 per cent of the truck market. Its combined North American market share was 13.6 per cent - 1.1 percentage points more than in the same period last year. International retail sales rose by 84 per cent to 30,676 units. Of these, 17,130 were sold in Europe, an increase of 48 per cent. The gain follows the introduction of the Jeep Grand Cherokee in European markets and the opening of a minivan assembly plant in Austria. For the first nine months of 1993, Chrysler's net loss totals Dollars 3.045bn compared with net earnings of Dollars 367m. A charge of Dollars 4.683bn was taken earlier in the year to cover a change in accounting for retiree healthcare.</p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> NEWS NOTES: Neil Diamond's upcoming Forum engagement has reached double digits.  A 10th show at the Forum is set for July 2. No other artist has played more  than six shows at the hall during a single engagement. . . . Eddie Murphy's  first album in four years, "So Happy," is due in August. The comedian, who had  a surprise pop hit in 1985 with "Party All the Time," worked this time with  producers Narada Michael Walden (who did the honors on the first single, "Put  Your Mouth on Me"), Nile Rodgers and Cameo's Larry Blackmon. . . . Joni  Mitchell, Kate Bush and Iggy Pop are among the artists featured on the new  "Spirit of the Forest" single, designed to raise awareness of destruction of  tropical rain forests.  </P> <P> Linda Ronstadt will join a host of '50s acts -- including the Platters and  Rosie &amp; the Originals -- in concerts July 1-2 at Cal State L.A. Ronstadt  will perform songs from her Spanish-language album "Canciones de Mi Padre" at  the shows, which benefit the Hollenbeck Youth Center in Boyle Heights. . . .  Director Oliver Stone has optioned the film rights to Danny Sugerman's rock 'n'  roll coming-of-age memoir, "Wonderland Avenue: Tales of Glamour &amp; Excess."  Sugerman worked his way into the Doors' organization at age 13 and continues to  act as the band's spokesman. . . . Malcolm McLaren's first album in four years,  "Waltz Darling," is due next month. The guiding force behind the Sex Pistols  released a single, "Deep in Vogue," last week. . . . Lou Adler didn't have to  look far when he wanted an oldie for his group Native. The reggae band chose  Sam Cooke's 1960 hit "Wonderful World," which Adler wrote 30 years ago with  Cooke and Herb Alpert -- whose A&amp;M Records distributes Adler's recently  reactivated Ode Sounds &amp; Visuals.  </P></p>

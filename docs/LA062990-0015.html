			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRUG CZAR WILLIAM BENNETT  </P> <P> So Bennett came to California and urged the state Senate to create a bill that  would re-criminalize marijuana here. Gov. George Deukmejian says if such a bill  comes to him, he will not hesitate to sign it.  </P> <P> What I would like to know is where do Bennett and Deukmejian plan to put the  several hundred thousand people who use marijuana when it's time to incarcerate  them and how do they plan to pay for the law enforcement, court costs and  prisons?  </P> <P> Deukmejian has repeatedly cut funds for family planning, education and health  care yet he thinks California can afford to pay for this absurd notion? I think  not.  </P> <P> DEBORAH BARNES  </P> <P> San Bernardino  </P></p>

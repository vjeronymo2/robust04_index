			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Firmer dollar leaves Dow mildly better Wall Street US SHARE prices posted modest gains yesterday, ending a two-day decline prompted by last week's bad August employment figures, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 10.80 better at 3,271.39. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 improved 1.92 to 416.36, while the American SE composite eased 0.54 to 382.82 and the Nasdaq composite put on 3.72 to 574.89. Turnover on the New York SE came to 179m shares, and rises outpaced declines by 931 to 807. The stock markets were aided at the opening by a firming of the dollar in overnight trading (the US currency gained almost two pfennigs against the D-Mark to just above DM1.41) and a higher Tokyo share market, but losses in European equities and slight weakness in US Treasury prices restrained sentiment in New York. Johnson &amp; Johnson fell in early trading after investors were unimpressed by the company's announcement of a new pact with Olympus for marketing, research and development in endoscopic surgery instrumentation. The decline in the share price was probably an expression of disappointment that the significant announcement that Johnson &amp; Johnson had promised on Tuesday failed to live up to expectations, and once that disappointment had eased the shares recovered to end a net Dollars  1/4 up at Dollars 52 . Compaq lost Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 32 7/8 in heavy trading after broking house Oppenheimer cut its rating to 'market perform' from 'short-term buy' because of concern about possible price cuts on personal computers and the stock's recent run-up. Campbell's Soup rose Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 39 3/8 after pleasing the market with fiscal fourth-quarter net income of 44 cents a share, up from 33 cents a year ago. Equitable put on Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 8 3/4 in busy trading after the insurance group forecast that third-quarter pre-tax profits would reach Dollars 25m, a significant turnround from the loss incurred from continuing operations in the second quarter. Family Dollar firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 17 5/8 on news that August sales rose about 7 per cent from a year ago, and that fiscal fourth-quarter sales were up 15.5 per cent from a year earlier. Chemical Bank eased Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 31 in early trading after securities house Salomon Brothers lowered its rating on the stock from a 'buy' to a 'hold' and reduced its earnings estimates for 1992 and 1993. The moves were made because credit quality costs were coming down more slowly than expected and problem loans were not improving as quickly as had been hoped. General Motors edged ahead Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 34 in spite of warnings from industry analysts that there could be further industrial disruption at the giant car manufacturer between now and next summer, when formal negotiations with the unions over pay and job cuts begin. Canada AMID THE volatility in world currency markets, traders found some solace in Toronto stocks, which closed only marginally lower. The Canadian dollar fell to a four-year low of CDollars 1.2185 to the US unit at one point, but partly recovered to CDollars 1.2145. The TSE 300 index lost 2.9 at 3,449.1 after shuffling within a five-point range. Declines led advances by 281 to 259 after volume of 28.7m shares.</p>

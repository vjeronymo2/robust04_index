			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GIRL SAFE AFTER KIDNAPING IN HER MOTHER'S STOLEN CAR  </P> <P> A 6-year-old girl kidnaped while she slept on the back seat of a car stolen  from her mother knocked on an apartment door this morning in South-Central Los  Angeles, eight hours after she was reported missing.  </P> <P> Lanesha Lynn Thomas told police that she awoke about 8 a.m. in the car, which  the thieves had abandoned on West 75th Street, Inglewood Police Officer Calvin  Smith said.  </P> <P> The woman who answered the door at the nearby apartment fed the little girl  breakfast while she waited for officers to arrive.  </P> <P> The girl and her mother, Katherine Toney, 26, were reunited at the Inglewood  Police Station.  </P> <P> Toney told police she was driving through Inglewood shortly after midnight when  the driver of a black Nissan lightly bumped her car near the intersection of  Century Boulevard and Van Ness Avenue.  </P> <P> Toney followed the car until it stopped on a side street. When she walked to  the back of her car to survey the damage, the passenger in the Nissan jumped  into her car and sped away with Lanesha.  </P> <P> The girl's grandmother, Judy Wilson, said she waited hours by the telephone for  word from police while Toney scoured the area looking for her daughter.  </P> <P> Police have no suspects and only general descriptions of the driver and  passenger. Both were teen-agers. One had long, curly hair and acne scars and  was wearing a black-and-white checkered shirt and black pants.  </P> <P> Officers said Toney's car was not damaged and Lanesha was not hurt.  </P></p>

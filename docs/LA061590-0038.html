			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOUSE GETS BILL ON BASIN, RIVER PROJECTS  </P> <P> The House Appropriations Committee sent to the full House this week a water and  energy development bill for fiscal 1991 that includes $2.5 million for the  Sepulveda Basin, $700,000 to study expanded use of the Los Angeles River and  $272,000 for restoration of Hansen Dam.  </P> <P> Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles) had sought $5 million for additional  landscaping, open space, trails and parking in the Sepulveda Basin and $1  million for a study of the Los Angeles River's recreational, transportation and  water conservation potential.  </P> <P> Beilenson plans to continue pressing for the additional $2.5 million in the  1992 budget, legislative assistant Melissa Kuckro said. Although the request  for river study funds was also reduced, she said the Appropriations Committee  generally provides a maximum of $500,000 for river studies but recognized that  this project was unusually complicated and costly.  </P> <P> Funds for Hansen Dam in the northeast San Fernando Valley, which were requested  by Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), are set aside in a 4-year-old  federal trust fund. The money is generated by the fees paid by a contractor who  is digging silt from flood control channels. The contractor, who sells the silt  to construction firms, pays between 15 and 25 cents into the fund for each ton  removed.  </P> <P> Berman also included language in the bill directing the U. S. Army Corps of  Engineers, which owns the 1,540-acre dam area, to continue the dredging until  it is completed. The corps is completing a master plan and environmental impact  statement for revitalization of the long-neglected lake property in Pacoima and  Lake View Terrace.  </P> <P> The House is expected to approve the water and energy development bill as  crafted by the Appropriations Committee. The Senate will adopt its own version,  and representatives from each chamber will meet to reconcile the two measures.  </P></p>

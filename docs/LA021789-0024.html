			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GALLERIES: WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> Ron Linden's new pieces take the solid roundness of a circle and whittle away  at it from the sides leaving the remainder to ruminate on ideas of wholeness.  </P> <P> Several consist of one unpainted round wood panel cleanly sliced through by  partial ellipses. The remaining flat shape resembles the head of a two-sided  ax.  </P> <P> Each orb speaks in emblematic, even heraldic terms about monumentality and  completeness. We wind up considering the significance of sliced-out sections in  pieces such as "Study for Deadwood" or casting their absence in symbolic light,  as in the political eulogy of "Rally."  </P> <P> Linden's work, with its manipulation of abstract, private symbols is  intellectually complex and often hard to penetrate. In good post-modern  tradition the objects reveal themselves to be involved in a self-conscious kind  of discussion that states "I'm making art that talks about art, even while it  deals with other issues." Where this work proves most enlightening is in its  exploration of perceived wholeness. The circle is used as both an opening and a  passing phase of openness -- framing and fragmenting constructed reality.  (Ovsey Gallery, 126 N. La Brea Ave., to March 11.)SUVAN GEER  </P></p>

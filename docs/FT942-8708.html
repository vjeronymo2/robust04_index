			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Technology: Another try at networks After a lukewarm reception for Windows NT, which Microsoft hoped would expand its dominance of desktop computing to the broader field of network computers, the company will soon release a new version - codenamed Daytona. This will be a significant improvement on the original version of NT, introduced last year, which has achieved only modest success in the client/server market. Demand has been 'much slower than we or anybody expected,' says Robert Palmer, chief executive of Digital Equipment, one of NT's strongest supporters in the computer industry. Daytona will address customer criticisms of the original Windows NT, says Greg Lobdell, Microsoft's product manager for advanced systems. In particular, it will reduce the amount of computer memory required. The new version will also improve the performance of both the desktop and server versions. Daytona will enable Microsoft to target the workstation software market, going head-to-head with Unix, the 'open systems' operating system now owned by Novell, and the various implementations of Unix developed by Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and others. Lobdell acknowledges that with its first version of Windows NT, Microsoft failed to position the product clearly: 'Windows NT was the answer, but no one knew what the question was.' But with the launch of Daytona, Microsoft will be able to define more clearly the product's role, he says. The new version has been heavily influenced by feedback from customers. They criticised the size and performance of the original desktop version of NT and its poor connectivity to other computers. The performance of standard Windows applications, and in particular the new Microsoft Office applications, was deemed too slow. As well as addressing these problems, Microsoft promises several improvements in the performance of Windows NT on network 'servers'.</p>

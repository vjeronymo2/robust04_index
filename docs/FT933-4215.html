			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (8): Task has been getting tougher by the day - Profits have fallen, but one famous name is managing remarkably well / BMW'S New Strategy MR Bernd Pischetsrieder, an earnest, mild-mannered engineer who joined BMW's production planning operations straight from university 20 years ago, knew he had a tough act to follow when he was appointed this year - at the age of 45 - to succeed Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim as BMW's management board chairman. Since May, when he first got his feet under the desk which Mr von Kunheim had occupied for 23 years, the task has been getting tougher almost by the day. Europe's car markets continue to weaken and the deteriorating competitiveness of Germany as a manufacturing base has become ever more cruelly exposed. Given the onset of recession in most of its important world markets since the start of the 1990s, BMW has, in fact, done remarkably well. Last year it built a record 598,000 cars - some 8 per cent more than the previous year and, for the first time, more than its rival, Mercedes-Benz. The value of sales rose by nearly 5 per cent to DM31.2bn. But operating profits fell by more than 15 per cent, to DM1.48bn. And for the first time since the mid-1980s, net profit was lower, by about 7 per cent at DM726m. And this year, with demand problems compounded by the D-mark still riding high on the Bundesbank's reluctance to cut interest rates, the profits situation has deteriorated sharply. Net profit for the first half fell by more than one-third to DM421m. Analysts expect full-year profits of about DM500m. Mr Pischetsrieder has also warned that there is no prospect of production matching 1992's levels. Car output in the first half was down 10 per cent at 275,000 - although this was still a much better performance than the German motor industry overall, which cut output by one quarter. Some markets, notably North America and the UK, are on the upswing, helping to counter the continental European sales slide. BMW should also benefit substantially when its new plant at Spartenburg, in South Carolina, starts production in 1995; it is expected to be able to build cars 40 per cent more cheaply than in Germany. The plant will add 70,000 cars a year to BMW's existing 560,000 cars a year capacity in Germany. The car will be an entirely new model, thought to be a sports car, for sale throughout the world. And an agreement just signed, under which 3-Series and 5-Series cars will be assembled in Vietnam, will also add to the - relatively minor - revenue stream from existing similar operations in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Latin America. But in the meantime, cost-cutting and greater commonality of components, backed up by the introduction of an array of new models to broaden BMW's available market, are now at the top of the agenda in terms of reversing the fall in profits. More jobs than the 3,500 already lost this year are likely to go as part of the process. With the greater diversity of models, Mr Pischetsrieder intends BMW to secure a step increase in its world market share from the current level of about 1.7 per cent. He indicates that the diversity is likely to take BMW into market sectors not associated with the company since the 1960s. The motor show now starting in Frankfurt is not expected to provide an immediate launch pad. More engine variants and extra models in the 3 and 5 series ranges are more in prospect. The company needs them, for it is about to start facing much stiffer competition from its arch-rival Mercedes' 190 replacement, now being launched. According to Mr Helmut Werner, Mercedes' chairman, some 150,000 of the new model will be made this year, rising to about 200,000 in 1994 and 250,000 in 1995. But more radical things are on the way from BMW. It does not exactly intend to return to producing the three-wheeled 'bubble cars' which were a familiar sight on Europe's roads 30 years ago. But like Mercedes' recently-unveiled concept 'city' car, the Vision A 93, BMW's similar Z13 urban runabout points the way to a possible whole new market sector for BMW in the mid-to-late 1990s. On the cost-cutting, Mr Pischetsrieder says he believes there is much greater scope for closer co-operation between European vehicle makers as well as the components industry to achieve savings. For example, he points out that it is self-defeating for individual manufacturers separately to develop complex and expensive systems to perform essentially the same task, using anti-lock braking systems developed by Alfred Teves, Robert Bosch and Mercedes as an illustration. Mercedes appears to agree. Already the two companies have started their first tentative collaboration on components. 'It would be ill-advised to continue to try to make everything ourselves,' Mr Werner says. Such a development marks a milestone in the history of both companies, each of which has remained among the most determinedly independent and vertically integrated of all the world's car companies. It is a measure of the severe pressures under which they, and the entire German motor industry, now find themselves. The pressures can only increase further - not go away.</p>

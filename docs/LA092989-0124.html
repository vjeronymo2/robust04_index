			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRAISE FOR THE DAUGHTER  </P> <P> It seems to me that Patti Davis should be admired and respected for her  courage, intelligence, capacity for independent thinking, and ambitions as a  writer instead of being subjected to arrogantly sarcastic editorializing and  nit-picking as was evidenced in Bettijane Levine's article ("A Second Crack At  'Daddy Dearest,' " Sept. 22).  </P> <P> First of all, Davis is the daughter of former President and Mrs. Ronald Reagan  and she knows much better than Levine does whether he or they were good  parents.  </P> <P> Reagan went to Washington as the master of ceremonies for The  Turn-Back-The-Clock Gang, and, as one of the worst Presidents in the nation's  history, did his damnedest to please the unpatriotic, tax-hating,  regulations-hating, racist, money-mad, would-be macho right-wing conservatives,  taking much of his lead from the Heritage Foundation.  </P> <P> Davis has properly described "my father's war" in Nicaragua. Praise for her is  in order. Definitely!  </P> <P> A.S. YOUNG, Los Angeles  </P></p>

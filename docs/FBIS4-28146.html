			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- MINJU CHOSON today sends  congratulations and greetings to the Swedish people on the  occasion of the national day of the Kingdom of Sweden.    Noting that the Swedish people have striven for the  development and prosperity of the country in the past, MINJU  CHOSON in a signed article says:    Korea and Sweden are geographically far away from each  other,  but have the bonds of friendship. The friendly relations have  grown stronger and developed since the diplomatic relations  between the two countries were established on April 7, 1973.    The Korean people wish the Swedish people greater success in  their endeavors for the independent development and prosperity  of the country.</p>

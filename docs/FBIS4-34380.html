			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "Notes and Information" page, editorial: "Economic </F> Terrorism Under Way"]    [Text] Much of the unrest in the market and among those who  seriously worry about the future of Brazilian economy should not  be attributed just to President Itamar Franco's  re-implementation of old habits. The president is partly  responsible, perhaps more than partly because he heads the  government, but to his excellency's responsibility should be  added that of those -- in Congress or in sectors of the  bureaucratic machinery -- who wish to reattribute to the public  sector its former prevalence over the private sector. It is  this wish that explains the campaign, which we could call a form  of terrorism, that has just begun to take shape and will reach a  climax during the period immediately preceding and following the  implementation of the real.    The executive branch views entrepreneurs as people who evade  taxes, create cartels, and abusively increases prices. To fight  tax evasion, the government uses the Federal Revenue Department,  the behavior of which clearly reflects the mentality of the  highest bureaucratic spheres of Brasilia: A tax collection goal  has been established, and it must be achieved at any price.  Control was first intensified, and there is nothing wrong with  that; on the contrary. As this was not strong enough and the  current laws -- no matter how strict or lax -- did not achieve  the desired target, a provisional measure was drafted to  transform what was a crime into a tort [ilicito civil]. This  provisional measure also established that those who collect  taxes or social contributions and who subsequently do not  transfer them to the Treasury or the Social Security Ministry  will be sentenced to 90 days in jail. Fear of being arrested,  however, probably will not result in increased revenues. The  government now wishes to make credit and debt operations a  triangular operation: If A has a debt with the Federal Treasury  and is owed some money by B, the Treasury will approach B and  collect some of what he owes A. It is not important if this  procedure clashes with the Fiscal Code or with good sense in  general. It does not matter if this move removes B's  "privilege" of not paying his debt to A on the day it becomes  due or if it extracts the resources A needs to finance his  company, the Federal Revenue department has money to collect  from A and will get it from B. Legally, everything is resolved  through the provisional measure, which Congress will not bother  to analyze because of its total lack of interest. The  provisional measure will be redrafted as many times as the  president and the Federal Revenue Department deem necessary.  This is "Itamar's popular democracy."    Control on economic activities is becoming stricter by the  day. The recently sanctioned Antitrust Law has been defended as  not having introduced anything new. It merely consolidates  current laws, seeking to ensure free competition. It just so  happens, however, that Delegated Law Number 4 and Law 8880/94  (which created the Real Value Unit -- URV) were not revoked.  Both these laws prevent infractions against the economic order.  The result of all that is that the Cade [Administrative council  for Economic Defense] is preparing to control oligopolies (a key  word meaning activity against the people). It is also preparing  to order the Sunab [National Supply Superintendency] to strictly  enforce the law against store owners. The campaign slogan is a  war against "abusive prices," the exact meaning of which no one  seems to know, and the definition of which cannot be found in  any law. The closest the government has come to explaining the  characteristics of this "crime" is contained in an article of  Law 8880, which states: "It is deemed abusive to unjustifiably  increase prices to a level where the price equivalent in URV's  is greater than the average increase registered from September  to December 1993." Thus, the plan that did not freeze prices  will punish those who cannot explain why their prices have gone  up. Bureaucrats are not concerned about "unjustified  increases," they are only concerned about "abusive increases"  which can only be identified after comparing the current price  to the September/December average price. To do so, no cost  analysis is conducted. In other words, despite all that is  being said about the market law, prices will remain frozen until  guidelines to clarify this policy are released.    Worse still is the government definition of an oligopoly.  The executive branch believes an oligopoly is synonymous of a  cartel and a situation where competition among companies that  work in an area of business simply does not exist. A  disinformation campaign against oligopolies has been continuing  since [former] President Collor's installation. As a result,  oligopolies have become cartels in all areas where there is no  competition. The Cade will focus on those oligopolies and on  the companies of the "highest concentration sectors." These two  types of companies will not be allowed to increase their June  prices beyond the September/December average. If they are lucky,  their managers will manage to justify increases. If bureaucracy  spots them, however, they will be charged with infractions  against the economic order, fined, and forced to comply with the  rules or run the risk of facing a warrant for preventive arrest.  When the Real Plan is effectively implemented, Sunab and Cade  will pursue those who abuse the people's patience -- and all  this will happen without a price freeze and in the defense of  free competition. This is just one more aspect of "Itamar's  popular democracy," which is closing in on "speculators..."</p>

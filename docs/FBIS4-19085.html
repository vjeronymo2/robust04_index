			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] The official talks between Turkey and Croatia were  held in Ankara today. An air transportation agreement was  signed between the two countries.    Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and foreign  minister who arrived in Ankara this morning, called on Foreign  Minister Hikmet Cetin and conferred with him for some time.  Later, talks were held between delegations headed by the  foreign ministers of the two countries.    In a statement before the meeting, Cetin noted that there  are  historical ties between Turkey and Croatia and expressed the  belief that economic and political relations will develop even  further. Cetin remarked that the Serbs should also take part in  the Washington agreement signed between Bosnians and Croatians.  The Washington agreement is important in creating a  multinational and multicultural Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cetin  stressed. Expressing gratitude for Croatia's assistance to  Turkish troop participation in the peace force in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cetin declared that Turkish soldiers will go  to Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to contribute to peace.    In turn, Granic thanked Turkey for its contribution to the  peace process. Explaining that the Washington agreement is  important because it grants equal rights to Muslims and  Croatians, Granic said: It is our aim to get the Serbs to also  take part in this agreement.    Later, Turkey and Croatia signed an air transportation  agreement. The agreement was signed by Ambassador Tugay  Ulucevik, deputy under secretary of the Foreign Ministry, and  Croatian Ambassador to Ankara (Hidayet Vichdivic). The  agreement envisages bilateral cooperation in the field of civil  aviation.</p>

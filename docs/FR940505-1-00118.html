Increases in the number of vehicles on the road and the number of vehicle miles traveled (VMT), threaten to outpace gains from technology. For the three FIP areas EPA utilizes the VMT growth projections provided by the local MPO or air quality management district. Growth in VMT can have significant impact on a given nonattainment area's ability to show attainment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In most, if not all, nonattainment areas changing driver behavior has been addressed primarily (if at all) through implementation of transportation control measures (TCMs). The TCMs found in SIPs have generally, in the past, been voluntary in nature and often have consisted of efforts to make transit more available through increased bus routes, light and heavy rail expansions and the building of park and ride lots. While these steps are laudable they do little to change the current equation faced by a user of our transportation system. Because our road and highway system is financed in large part by general revenues (40 percent), and because drivers do not pay for the congestion and pollution they cause, the use of our roadways appears to users to carry a relatively low cost. In addition, single-occupant vehicles have considerable advantage in terms of convenience and privacy. Thus, any attempt to promote the use of alternatives to single-occupancy vehicles faces quite a challenge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The limited effectiveness of traditional TCMs has led many in Federal, State and local government and in academia to promote instead the use of market-based TCMs. (See Cameron, Shoup for DOT, EPA/DOT Report to Congress, forthcoming NARC report by Apogee). Congestion pricing, parking reform, and VMT and emission fees all show great promise as effective means of changing driver behavior by making travel choices reflect more closely their true social costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA seriously considered making market-based TCMs an integral part of the FIP, however, within the context of the FIP, neither traditional TCMs nor market-based TCMs lend themselves easily to Federal implementation. The very nature of many traditional TCMs limits their usefulness within the context of the FIP. FIP authority does not allow the Agency to take on fundamentally local roles such as building new transit lines, expanding bus services, or building HOV lanes. If EPA were to impose emission fees or VMT fees or to institute congestion pricing, all revenue generated would have to go to the Federal Treasury (see the above discussion of the Miscellaneous Receipts Act in section III.A.2.b). Such a flow of revenue out of the FIP areas could have numerous adverse impacts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the issue of fees, especially VMT fees, raises other inherently local issues such as land use planning. There are many theories and explanations for the rapid and continual growth in VMT over the last few decades_increases in women in the work force, population growth, increases in average income_but suburban sprawl also plays a significant role. For a variety of reasons, crime, housing costs, land costs, etc. the bulk of growth in metropolitan areas has been occurring in the suburbs. The lower housing densities and lack of mixed use zoning in most suburbs have made use of a car a daily necessity. Just as these patterns of land use occurred over a long period of time in response to local demands, so must future changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Despite the EPA assessment that control of VMT growth and the use of market-based TCMs are most appropriately considered at the local level, EPA would like to present an outline of a reasonable and, at the state or local level, an arguably workable light duty vehicle fee system, based on both emissions and vehicle miles traveled. EPA invites comment on federal implementation of this approach or any other appropriate market-based measures. If changes in technical estimates or in the stringency of other controls are made following public comment, EPA may have to turn to a fee system as described below despite the reservations voiced above. In such a case, EPA would obtain more public input on program specifics before implementation, including if appropriate, reproposal and public comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A fee on the product of emissions level and VMT would provide incentives for individuals to reduce emissions but also would provide them with some flexibility to achieve those reductions. A driver could choose to reduce her fee by buying a cleaner vehicle, or she could reduce her fee burden by driving fewer miles. Most likely, individuals would consider the trade-offs they face and choose a course of action most appropriate for their circumstances. In thinking about this fee system, EPA has attempted to remain sensitive to many issues surrounding fees and the incentives they provide. EPA used as a guide California Senate Bill 1070, and many of the principles it provides. As in Bill 1070, EPA believes a fee collected at biennial inspection and maintenance points which is a function of VMT in excess of an annual per driver allotment of 5,000 miles and of the vehicle's I/M score recorded after any necessary repairs have taken place would be most workable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA recognizes that the automobile represents for many people in the FIP area the only means of getting to work. Therefore, EPA suggests each licensed driver over the age of 18 could be allocated 5,000 ``free'' miles annually. Drivers in one household could combine their allowances however they choose, and use them to cover some of the VMT from the household's vehicles. EPA suggests this lifeline level based on data in the 1990 National Personal Travel Survey (NPTS) conducted by DOT. According to the 1990 NPTS, on average 32 percent of VMT and 26 percent of trips are directly the result of commuting. The average new car mileage (older model years are driven fewer miles in each successive year) is 15,000 miles. Thus 5,000 represents, on average, the upper end of commuting miles for a given driver. However, EPA invites comment on this issue. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Obviously the emission component of the fee provides an incentive for the vehicle owner to reduce vehicle emissions. How an individual chooses to do so is somewhat dependent on the way in which the fee is set. If the fee is charged based on how much the vehicle's emissions exceed the average emissions from other vehicles from the same model year, then the owner of the vehicle is interested in keeping the vehicle in good working order to ensure average or better emissions for a car of that model year. A fee set in this way does not penalize an owner for having an old car (and therefore old emissions technology) per se, but for having an old car dirtier than other cars of its age. The fee then does little to encourage the owner to replace the vehicle with one offering newer and therefore cleaner technology. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If, on the other hand, the fee is set based on actual emissions, owners still have an incentive to keep each car as clean as possible, but they face an added incentive to invest in cleaner technology. An added bonus for California of this type of emission fee is that it would address the question of vehicles not meeting California emissions standards which are brought into California by new residents (``49 state vehicles''). Any additional emissions resulting from a 49 state vehicle would be appropriately charged a fee, eliminating the need for a separate program to address those emissions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Bundesbank rate cut lifts dollar: Pressure on franc eases - Devaluation fears grow over punt FOREIGN EXCHANGE dealers reacted positively yesterday to the Bundesbank's decision to shave its money-market interest rates earlier this week, pushing the dollar up to its highest level against the D-Mark since the summer and easing the selling pressure on the French franc inside the European exchange rate mechanism. However, the punt, the victim of intense selling earlier in the week, continued to perform weakly against the strong ERM currencies, increasing speculation that the currency may be devalued. In morning trading in Europe, the punt strengthened after the Bank of Ireland raised the interest rate for lending punts overnight from 50 per cent to 100 per cent. But it retreated, falling close to its ERM floor against the guilder by the close. The dollar rose initially after the Bundesbank's decision on Thursday to cut the rate at which it lends money to commercial banks in the German money market by 15 basis points to 8.60 per cent. It rallied to DM1.6490, its highest level since the summer, but lost momentum following poorer-than-expected employment figures in the US, which suggested to some dealers that the US economy may not be growing as fast as anticipated. The December non-farm payroll rose by 64,000 on the month, less than expected. The dollar closed in London at DM1.6375, slightly up on the day. In New York it closed at DM1.6475. The payroll figure contributed to a sharp decline in US share prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 30 points at one stage before finishing 17.02 lower at 3,251.67. Weak bond prices and US-Iraq political tensions contributed to the fall. The Bundesbank move helped the French franc to rally as high as FFr3.3950 to the D-Mark but it fell back to FFr3.402, more than 3 centimes from its ERM floor. In New York it closed at FFr3.4025. The franc may have been boosted by comments from Mr Reimut Jochimsen, a member of the Bundesbank's general council, who said the bank had taken into account the slowing economy and the situation on foreign exchanges when deciding to ease policy.

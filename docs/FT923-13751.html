			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Tax on a mortgage IF I were to take a mortgage on my own home, on which I currently have no loan, for the purpose of buying a property let or available for letting at a commercial rent (probably a shop investment), can you confirm that interest on the loan would be allowable as an expense against rent and not subject to the restrictions (Pounds 30,000 limit and base rate only) that apply to a loan to purchase one's own residence? If so, would the Revenue require the mortgage and the purchase to happen at the same time. I assume I could not take the mortgage now in the hope of purchasing a suitable investment, possibly at auction, in due course. The interest would be an allowable expense subject to the more-than-26-weeks letting conditions set out in section 355(1)(b) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. Section 367(2) requires a loan to be made 'on the occasion of, or within what is in the circumstances a reasonable time from, the application of the money', and the proceeds of a loan must not be 'applied for some other purpose before being applied' for a qualifying purpose. The solicitors who act for you in the mortgage and conveyancing will be able to guide you through the tax pitfalls, of course. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

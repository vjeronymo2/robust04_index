			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Growth figure for last year revised down The UK's economy grew more slowly than was previously thought last year  - but yesterday's raft of economic statistics revealed some encouraging underlying trends. Companies are building up stock levels and consumers are reducing savings. Both factors should help the UK recovery to continue this year. The Central Statistical Office says gross domestic product at constant prices grew by 0.7 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year compared with its earlier estimate of 0.8 per cent. Overall, the UK economy grew by 1.9 per cent between 1992 and 1993, down from the previous estimate of 2 per cent. If oil and gas are excluded, 1993 GDP was 1.6 per cent higher than in 1992. The main reasons for the downward revision were a weaker trade position and construction activity. The trade effect knocked 1.3 per cent off GDP in the fourth quarter. CSO figures show that consumers continued to spend, in spite of little growth in incomes. During the fourth quarter, real personal disposable income grew by just 0.1 per cent, but consumers' expenditure increased by 1.1 per cent. The difference was absorbed by a fall in savings. The savings ratio - calculated by dividing personal savings by total personal disposable income  -fell to 10.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1993, from a revised 11 per cent in the third quarter. If April's tax rises are not to derail the UK recovery, consumers are going to have to spend more and save less. Economists are therefore looking for the savings ratio to fall this year. Mr Geoffrey Dicks, UK economist at NatWest Markets, said the figures showed that consumers' incomes are already under pressure, even ahead of the tax increases, and this may limit the ability of the savings ratio to fall further. But Mr Adam Cole, UK economist at James Capel, said all the factors that drive the savings ratio are pointing in the right direction: interest rates and inflation are low and unemployment is falling. The increase in stocks and work in progress in the fourth quarter was revised up to Pounds 968m from an earlier estimate of Pounds 597m. Stockbuilding contributed a 0.9 per cent increase to GDP in the fourth quarter. Mr Adam Cole, UK economist at James Capel, said: 'We are at a position where the level of stocks is broadly in line with the trend of output. There is no massive buffer of stocks available to absorb demand and therefore future growth in demand will translate into growth in output.' A further encouraging sign is that UK companies are starting to invest. A 23.7 per cent rise in gross trading profits in 1993 and a Pounds 2.97bn financial surplus - the first since 1987 - encouraged the corporate sector to invest in plant and machinery. Gross domestic fixed capital formation grew by 2.5 per cent between the third and fourth quarters of 1993, the largest quarterly increase since the first quarter of 1989.</p>

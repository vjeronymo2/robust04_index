			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Haitian boat refugee exodus increases THE US Coast Guard has stated that it intercepted 1,635 Haitian boat-people on Tuesday  - a record number of such refugees picked up by the service in any one day on the high seas, AP reports from San Juan, Puerto Rico. In the picture above, a Haitian girl and compatriots wait aboard a Coast Guard ship at the US naval base of Guantanamo, in south-eastern Cuba, to be processed by the authorities. The base now holds some 12,000 Haitian refugees and there are fears that it will be able to admit no more. People are fleeing Haiti at unprecedented rates. A record 10,104 refugees were intercepted by the service in May. The Coast Guard has intercepted 33,690 Haitian asylum-seekers bound for the US since September 30 last year, when the Haitian army overthrew the elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. In the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince, meanwhile, the government late on Wednesday condemned the Organisation of American States for having adopted tougher economic sanctions, which the army-backed administration claimed would starve Haitians.</p>

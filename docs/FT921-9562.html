			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Wace focuses on Parkway share deals WACE GROUP said yesterday its internal inquiry since the sudden departure of its managing director Mr John Clegg 10 days ago had revealed 'potentially unlawful dealings' in the shares of Parkway Group, one of its largest and most ambitious acquisitions. 'Neither Wace nor any members of the existing board was a party to these share dealings,' the printing services company added. The inquiry now focuses on dealing in Parkway shares in the weeks before August 1, 1990, when Wace announced its bid of 28p cash per Parkway share, double the the previous day's price. Parkway, Wace's largest rival in 'pre-press' services which prepare text and graphics for printing, was named USM company of the year in March 1989. But within 15 months it was highly indebted and its value had fallen from Pounds 110m to less than Pounds 10m. It has become clear, however, the insider dealing unit of the London Stock Exchange looked into share dealing in the Parkway takeover, but it is understood it failed to find evidence to support the suspicions. The exchange declined to comment yesterday. It is illegal under the Companies Securities (Insider Dealing) Act 1985 to deal in shares of a quoted company when in possession of private information that, if public, would materially affect the share price. The exchange's inquiries are understood to have prompted wider questions about the history of Wace's funding. Mr Clegg left after a week of speculation about the funding of his original Pounds 700,000 investment in Wace. He denied allegations the company was under investigation for connections with the IRA. Wace said yesterday it had found 'no evidence of any link between the company or its existing or past directors and the IRA or any other terrorist organisation'. Security sources had already said they found no evidence for the allegations. Yesterday another clue emerged to the original investment. Mr Richard Thomas, a former finance director of Helical Bar, the quoted property, development and investment compnay said Mr Clegg's family made a profit of around Pounds 260,000 on buying and selling a stake in the company in 1982. He said about 26.7 per cent of Helical's shares were bought for Pounds 220,000 by Mr Michael Clark but the shares were registered in the name of Miss Jayne Wright, said by Mr Clegg to be his cousin. The Wright shareholding was later sold for a total of Pounds 480,000. Mr Clegg bought into Wace Group soon afterwards and has repeatedly said the money came from Miss Wright's family inheritance.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi at Rinas </F> Airport on 15 June -- recorded]    [Text] [Announcer] Prime Minister Meksi left for  Switzerland.    [Correspondent] Heading a government delegation, Prime  Minister Aleksander Meksi left for Switzerland today to attend  the Crans Montana forum proceedings. High-level officials from  various countries of the world have been invited to this  meeting. The Crans Montana forum representatives organize  roundtable talks to discuss situations and prospects of the  development of world cooperation.    Before departure, Mr. Meksi made this statement for the  television:    [Begin Meksi recording] Our delegation that will participate  in the annual meeting of the Crans Montana Forum aims to present  the Albanian reform with its results and difficulties, the  institutional changes carried out in Albania, their perspective  and future goals. It also intends to profit from the experiences  of other countries that entered into reform before us or at the  same time as us. As is known, this annual meeting of the forum  will be attended by delegations from all former-communist  Eastern European countries, as well as countries from Central  Europe and international structures. That is, we will have an  exchange of experiences and opinions, as well as contacts that  will benefit Albanian foreign policy and be in the interests of  Albania's economic development.    I think that these meetings are useful. Our delegation will  try to truly present the political, economic, and institutional  reforms in Albania, with all their benefits and difficulties.

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Low spirits at Guinness A little extra on the dividend to compensate for a poor profits performance is a mixed blessing when the company concerned is Guinness. There is no denying its comfortable cover ratio or the strength of its cash-flow, even after stripping out the unusual fall in UK tax paid last year. Guinness certainly has the resources to continue increasing its dividend, but it looks odd to stress that when the company is not traditionally perceived as a yield stock. The cynic might conclude that a return to rapid earnings growth is even more remote than ever. It is not just that the Japanese salaryman has been forced to trade down to Johnnie Walker Red Label, pay for it himself and drink it at home. With hindsight, the expansion into Spanish brewing, especially the purchase of Union Cervecera, looks anything but a stroke of pure genius. The restructuring will be expensive and arduous. There is incipient recovery in the UK, but the improvement in the US is overshadowed by the threat of a federal duty on spirits. This is not to belittle underlying growth of 6 per cent in spirits and 9 per cent in beer. Despite difficult markets, Guinness managed to improve the mix of its spirits sales, but the jury is still out on when global recovery will be strong enough to encourage large-scale trading up to premium brands. Until then, the shares will hardly regain their premium rating.</p>

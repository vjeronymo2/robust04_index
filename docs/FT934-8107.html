			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: European unemployment crisis and monetary policy inseparable Sir, Saying that the ''real issue' facing Europe is the task of reducing unemployment' is - as far as I can see it - virtually unchallenged ('Pohl sees jobs crisis as main European task', November 11). I do not see the European unemployment crisis as separate from a common and co-ordinated European monetary policy. The argument is two-fold. First, a monetary union has never been a goal per se. It has been decided upon as an instrument to reduce exchange rate risks and foster trade. Increased trade, in turn, will help to create additional jobs. Second, the options that governments have to reduce unemployment are very limited, almost non-existent: a traditional Keynesian-style fiscal stimulus programme might, faced with high public debts and deficits, be an ill-advised policy or simply impossible. The same argument basically applies to tax-reduction proposals. Expansive monetary policy, as undertaken in North America, stops in Frankfurt. Labour market deregulating policies, at least as long as they translate into an erosion of real wages, will constrain aggregate demand even further. So, why not exploit the few remaining options Europe still has? Analysing the common-currency debate in light of the European unemployment crisis leads to the recommendation to speed up the process to Emu rather than to slow it down. A common monetary policy should remain the main priority. Jan-Peter Olters, 3558 Avenue Lorne #7, Montreal, PQ H2X 2A6, Canada</p>

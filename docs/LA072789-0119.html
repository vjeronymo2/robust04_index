			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIRPORT CONTRACTS DEFENDED  </P> <P> In a presentation intended to dispel concerns about the role of its minority  and female partners, Duty Free Shoppers Group Ltd. Partnership on Wednesday  assured Los Angeles airport officials that the partners are directly involved  in running gift and duty-free shops at Los Angeles International Airport.  </P> <P> Duty Free Shoppers officials promised the Board of Airport Commissioners that  the minority- and female-run firms will assume virtual control of shops at two  airport terminals by the end of the year. They said the practical experience in  running the shops is intended to prepare the two firms -- Mir Kanon Inc. and  Peideau Inc. -- to operate such businesses on their own.  </P> <P> "We are really proud of our majority partners for accepting us and in allowing  us to learn their business the way they have," said Iris D. Rideau, who  represented Peideau at the meeting.  </P> <P> Concession contracts at the city-owned airport, including those with Duty Free  Shoppers, are under investigation by city officials because they appear to lack  the level of participation by minority partners that federal guidelines  require. The guidelines are designed to increase participation by disadvantaged  minorities and women in contracts by giving them clearly defined, hands-on  roles in running the concessions.  </P> <P> Airport commissioners, however, said Wednesday that they were satisfied with  Duty Free Shoppers' explanations. "I think that this report exemplifies what  the mayor has been saying to us for a long time," Commission President Jerry B.  Epstein said. "If we can extend this formula that you are doing to other  industries here, you will have really set a tremendous example of what can be  done."  </P> <P> The Duty Free Shoppers contracts have drawn particular attention because Mir  Kanon and Peideau have the same 10 partners, including Betty Dixon, the wife of  Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), who heads the House Ethics Committee.  Duty Free Shoppers, the world's largest duty-free concessionnaire, brought in  the 10 partners to boost its chances of winning contracts to operate shops at  the airport.  </P> <P> Betty Dixon was not at Wednesday's meeting but has acknowledged that she has  not served in any hands-on management position in one Duty Free Shoppers  contract and has been involved only "on a limited basis" in another.  </P> <P> Duty Free Shoppers officials did not directly address the level of Dixon's  involvement except to assure the airport commissioners that "all shareholders  of Mir Kanon and Peideau attend Management Committee meetings every six  months." They also said representatives from the two firms attend monthly  meetings that oversee operations of the duty-free concession and the gift and  news concession.  </P> <P> Joe Lyons, vice president of business development for Duty Free Shoppers,  acknowledged, however, that when differences arise about running the stores,  Duty Free, which has a 68% interest in the joint venture, has the final say.  The Department of Airports has set a goal of giving minority-owned businesses a  20% stake in companies that get contracts, and female-owned businesses 12%.  </P> <P> The presentation was held in response to questions from the commission  following news reports about Dixon's role in the firms. The substance of  Wednesday's meeting mirrored a letter last month from Duty Free Shoppers to  Clifton Moore, the airport department's executive director.  </P> <P> Moore told The Times in June that he was critical of Dixon's role in the joint  venture because her limited involvement in the airport concessions "does not  seem to be consistent" with the minority participation program approved by the  department.  </P></p>

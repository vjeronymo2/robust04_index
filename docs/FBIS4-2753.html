			<p>BFN     [Text] Xining, April 13 (XINHUA) -- The development of  power industry has given rise to a new economic structure  featuring salt, petrochemical, steel, lead, magnesium, gold,  asbestos and ferrosilicon production in this remote province of  Qinghai Province.    According to Liu Yingkuan, head of the provincial  administration of power industry, by the end of last year the  province had an installed capacity of 1.73 million kw,  generating over 6 billion kwh [kilowatt hours] of electricity.    The total production value of Qinghai's power industry last  year was 639 million yuan (about 70 million U.S. dollars).    Promoted by the advancing power industry, the province's  gross national product (GNP) and total industrial and  agricultural output value has exceeded 10 billion yuan (over one  billion U.S. dollars) for the first time in history.    As a resources-rich province, Qinghai boasts the country's  largest reserves of salt, potassium, magnesium, lithium and  asbestos as well as vast reserves of oil, natural gas and gold.  Most of the mineral resources are located in the Qaidam Basin,  dubbed the "treasure bowl" of China.    The Yellow, Chang Jiang and Lancang Rivers flowing through  the province promise great potential for development of the  hydro-power industry.    The province's proven exploitable reserves of water power  stand at 21.65 million kw.    Over ten large and medium-sized power stations can be built  along 276 kilometers of the Yellow River between Longyang Gorge  and Sigou Gorge.    The Longyang Gorge Power Station with an installed capacity  of 1.28 million kw has produced over 26 billion kwh of  electricity since it was put into operation in 1989. That has  relaxed the constricted supply of electric power in northwest  China and also attracted over 30 big industrial enterprises,  such as the Qinghai Aluminum Plant and the Minhe Magnesium Plant.    Two key state power projects -- the Lijia Gorge Power  Station  on the Yellow River, with an installed capacity of 2 million kw,  and the Xining Qiaotou Thermal Power Plant -- are now under  construction in Qinghai.    Construction of another medium-sized hydro-power station is  scheduled to start this year.    In order to bring the power industry into full play in local  economic progress, the province has also attached importance to  construction of small hydro-power stations along its 108 rivers  including the Golmud, Longwu, Bayin, Baishui and Babao.    Up to now, more than 160 small power stations, with a  installed capacity of 110,000 kw each, have been built on the  rivers.</p>

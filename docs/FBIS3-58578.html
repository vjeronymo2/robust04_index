			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] President Glavkos Kliridhis has said that our  side will continue to show goodwill in negotiations for a just,  viable, and functional Cyprus solution. He warned, however,  that it would be wrong to misinterpret the goodwill as a  willingness to accept a solution that will not secure the  withdrawal of the occupation troops and the implementation of  human rights and basic freedoms. Kliridhis was speaking at  ceremony to unveil a statue of Griyorios Avxendiou dedicated by  Lisi Municipality in Kalo Khorion, Larnaca.    Kliridhis reiterated that the struggle continues to free  Cyprus from the occupation troops and settlers, to secure the  right to return of the refugees, to safeguard human rights for  all citizens, and to determine the fate of the missing persons.  He added that we are also striving for Cyprus to join the  European Union and to achieve progress in conditions of  permanent peace and security. He stressed: We will accept  nothing less than this.

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / New debt crisis may hit Latin America Latin American borrowers have raised more than Dollars 40bn (Pounds 27bn) in the last four years through foreign bond issues. But a new report from economists at the US bank, JP Morgan, suggests that the debt crisis of the 1980s may be revisited on some countries in the 1990s, in a new form. It pinpoints a lack of growth in exports as the main source of weakness. 'Latin America remains vulnerable to external shocks, whether on the trade front or in the global capital markets,' the bank argues in a review of the sustainability of Latin America's debts. It says that such risks do not appear urgent today and that Latin American economies are in much better balance internally than in the early 1980s because fiscal deficits have been reduced or turned into surpluses. But it argues that the region's trade and current account balances have worsened since then, leaving economies vulnerable. This deterioration has been due both to trade liberalisation and the renewed availability of foreign capital. 'While these current account balances are readily financed at the present time, because of the availability of external capital, the deterioration in their external balances suggests that some Latin American countries may find themselves unable to generate sufficient future foreign exchange earnings at some point in the future,' the report says. It argues that the current availability of external finance provides countries with an opportunity to develop competitive export sectors. Unless this happens - and the implication of the report is that Chile is the only country where export performance has shown a marked improvement since the 1980s - the countries may be vulnerable in the future to a sudden shift in investor preferences. The report says that some measures of capacity to pay have improved in most countries since the early 1980s. But one important criterion - the ratio of debt to exports - leaves Latin America at higher levels than many other developing countries. Only Mexico and Chile have substantially lowered their debt-to-export ratios in the last decade. However, other factors reduce the region's vulnerability to debt problems. First, the base of investors is more diversified and therefore may not be as sheep-like as commercial banks were in the early-1980s. Second, external finance is going mainly to private rather than public sector borrowers - although well over 30 per cent of Latin Eurobonds were issued by the public sector in 1990-93. Third, the new wave of Eurobonds has been largely tied to fixed rather than floating interest rates, with only 4 per cent of the 1990-93 Eurobonds carrying floating coupons.</p>

			<p>941108 FT  08 NOV 94 / Solomon Islands PM elected Mr Solomon Mamaloni was yesterday elected prime minister of the Solomon Islands, following the resignation of Mr Francis Billy Hilly, the previous incumbent, last week. In his swearing-in speech, Mr Mamaloni hinted the new government would review logging policy, and warned that the Pacific nation's economic condition was 'precarious'. Logging in the Solomons has been the subject of international attention, with criticism levelled at some of the foreign companies operating there. Mr Mamaloni, 1982-84 and 1989-93 prime minister, is a popular figure in the Solomon Islands. But he can be unpredictable and in the past has fallen out with other governments, according to a diplomat in Honiara.</p>

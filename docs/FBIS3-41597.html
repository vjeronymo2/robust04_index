Egypt's delegation to the two-day meetings is led by Ambassador  Hajar al-Islambuli, director of the Economic Affairs Department  in the Foreign Ministry.    The participants in the meetings will discuss the problem of  desertification in the Middle East; the disposal of contaminated  and solid wastes, particularly from oil; and pollution in the  Gulf of Aqaba, which Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Israel  overlook. Delegates from more than 40 countries in the Middle  East, the Gulf, the Arab Maghreb, and Europe, in addition to the  United States, Canada, Russia, China, and Japan, are taking part  in the meetings. The committee meetings have been boycotted by  both Syria and Lebanon, which are making progress on the  bilateral tracks a condition for their attendance at the  multilateral talks.    Sources close to the committee, which Egypt is hosting, have  stated that the group will try to put the ideas and proposals  discussed at previous meetings into practice. During previous  meetings, the United States and some world major powers promised  to bear the costs of the projects related to this issue in the  region. The sources noted the importance of the discussions  conducted by the five committees stemming from the multilateral  talks, which are arms control, water, economic development,  refugees, and environment.    Addressing the opening session, Assistant Foreign Minister  'Adil al-Safti emphasized that the new atmosphere of peace in  the Middle East provides a chance for progress on all the peace  tracks. He noted that progress in the bilateral talks will give  the countries that are not participating in the multilateral  talks the chance to do so. He noted that Egypt and the region's  countries attach importance to the environment and the need to  protect it. He added that if economic development does not take  the need for a clean environment into account, it will be  incomplete. He stressed that Egypt calls for establishing  regional cooperation to protect the environment.    He reiterated Egypt's firm position that progress in the  various areas of cooperation among the region's countries  depends on progress in the bilateral talks. Al-Safti noted that  the establishment of a just peace in the Middle East will give  rise to the establishment of regional cooperation on a sound  basis that serves the interests of the region's people.    The two-day meetings will examine all issues related to  environmental protection and ways to deal with the  desertification and drought affecting some of the region's  countries.</p>

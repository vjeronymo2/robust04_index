			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> ELLARD DISPLAYS HIS FORWARD-FLIP FORM, EXECUTES A PERFECT '10'  </P> <P> Sure, Henry Ellard has caught 61 passes for 1,176 yards and eight touchdowns,  but until Sunday's game against the Phoenix Cardinals, there was a void in his  season.  </P> <P> And then, late in the fourth quarter, Ellard caught a Jim Everett pass across  the middle and ran in for a 42-yard touchdown.  </P> <P> And Ellard kept running, and running . . .  </P> <P> "I said, 'Man, what are you doing?' " receiver Ron Brown said. "He said, 'I'm  going to flip.' So I backed off and said, 'Be my guest.' "  </P> <P> Ellard accepted the invitation, and executed an impressive forward flip, a  signature move that had been lacking from his repertoire this season.  </P> <P> "I'd say it was a 9.0, 8.5, 9.0, 9.0, 9.0," Ellard said.  </P> <P> Someone quipped that the East German judge was probably to blame for the 8.5  mark.  </P> <P> Brown, however, was much more generous.  </P> <P> "That was a 10, definitely," he said. "He had a nice tuck, good height on the  jump and a good landing. I was impressed."  </P> <P> Brown, known more for his kickoff returns, got his first and second receptions  of the season.  </P> <P> "We've got so many good receivers on this team that you've kind of got to wait  your turn," Brown said.  </P> <P> Asked if he could flip if he scored, Brown said, yes, but, "that's Henry's  thing, I wouldn't want to cut in."  </P> <P> Proving once again to be one of the most misleading statistics in football, the  Rams throttled Phoenix, 37-14, but beat the Cardinals in time of possession by  less than a minute.  </P> <P> The Rams had the ball for 30:26; the Cardinals 29:34.  </P> <P> Quarterback Timm Rosenbach, a rookie picked by the Cardinals in the  supplemental draft from Washington State, made his first appearance in an NFL  game.  </P> <P> "I knew it was either going to happen in a game that we were blowing someone  out, or in one that we were getting blown out," Rosenbach said. "It's  unfortunate it had to happen under these circumstances, but I was glad to get  the experience."  </P> <P> Rosenbach said he was nervous before taking his first snap early in the fourth  quarter.  </P> <P> "I was shaking like crazy, I'm still shaking," he said.  </P> <P> Rosenbach was so pumped for the chance, that on his first pass attempt, he  overthrew receiver Ernie Jones by about 10 feet.  </P> <P> "I got hit with a pretty good lick on that play," Rosenbach said. "It was like,  'Welcome to the NFL.' "  </P> <P> Rosenbach settled down enough to have a pretty good quarter. He completed seven  of 14 passes for 81 yards and guided the Cardinals on a 51-yard touchdown  drive. He completed three passes for 50 yards, was sacked once for a loss of  11, and ran once for eight yards.  </P> <P> "I was just running around like a chicken with his head cut off," Rosenbach  said. "I was trying to have fun."  </P> <P> Rosenbach's poultry performance did rank him with running back Tony Jordan as  the Cardinals leading rusher in the game. Each had 18 yards.  </P> <P> Phoenix starting quarterback Gary Hogeboom was pulled by Coach Gene Stallings  early in the second half.  </P> <P> Hogeboom, who entered the game with a pass-completion percentage of 57%, but  had thrown more interceptions (13) than touchdowns (10), asked Stallings, "What  did I do?"  </P> <P> Apparently not enough.  </P> <P> Hogeboom completed six of 10 passes for 48 yards, but threw two interceptions,  including one to Michael Stewart, who returned it 41 yards for a touchdown in  the first quarter.  </P> <P> There was Tony Dorsett, who decided after a trip to Paris between his junior  and senior seasons at the University of Pittsburgh that his name would not be  pronounced DOR-sit, but dor-SET.  </P> <P> There was Joe Theismann, who went from THEES-men, to THIGHS-men (rhymes with  Heisman, as in trophy).  </P> <P> And now there is Ram running back Robert (call me Bobby) Delpino.  </P> <P> Delpino, who has been called Robert all of his life, said he might as well  become Bobby since that's what coaches and teammates insist on calling him.  </P> <P> And as someone pointed out, Bobby is a much more appropriate for someone who  makes his living butting heads.  </P></p>

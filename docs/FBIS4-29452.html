			<p>BFN     [Text] Indonesian Ambassador Pieter Damanik yesterday  indicated that the mild rift in RP [Republic of the  Philippines]-Indonesia relations over the recent Asian-Pacific  Conference on East Timor [APCET] were healed.    "I can tell you that there is no problem in the relationship  between the Philippines and Indonesia," said Mr. Damanik.  "President Suharto appreciates very much the decision taken by  President Ramos in connection with the APCET," he added.    The Indonesian ambassador likewise indicated his country was  ready to host the RP-Moro National Liberation Front talks as  well as participate in the first meeting of members of the East  Asian Growth Area. He said his government was just waiting for  the dates.    President Ramos yesterday witnessed the turnover of the  formal proposal of Jakarta-based PT Citra Lamtoro Gung Persada  for the South Luzon Expressway and skyway projects with the  Philippine National Construction Company (PNCC).    In a press conference, Mr. Damanik said Indonesian President  Suharto had personally given PT Citra the go signal to formalize  talks with the PNCC, an event pending since September 1993.    "Actually this is a private sector initiative," he said,  "but, since this is happening in an ASEAN country ... in the  spirit of ASEAN, President Suharto has blessed this project," he  said.    PT Citra is chaired by Mr. Suharto's daughter Siti. However,  she was not able to come for the presentation of the proposal.  Instead, the company's vice chairman, Djoko Ramidji, turned  over the documents to Public Works Secretary Gregorio Vigilar.    The first phase of the project will be the construction of a  12.2-km. skyway between Bicutan and Buendia and the upgrading of  the existing South Luzon Expressway. Total cost is some  $300-400 million, with a two-year period.    In a press conference, Mr. Ramos said the formal proposal of  PT Citra will trigger the formal negotiations between the  government and the Indonesian firm. It is yet not clear if the  project will be undertaken as a government project, a  build-operate-and-transfer project, or both.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Bosnian rivals discuss carve-up BOSNIAN President Alija Izetbegovic last night held face-to-face talks with Serb and Croat rivals for the first time since January as negotiations began which could lead to the ethnic division of Bosnia. The leaders of the three main ethnic groups in Bosnia met for unscheduled talks which included Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, his Croatian counterpart Mr Franjo Tudjman and President Momir Bulatovic of Montenegro, which with Serbia forms the rump Yugoslav state. The talks came as international mediators Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg tried to persuade Mr Izetbegovic to drop his demand that a future Bosnia be based on centralised federation. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader and Mr Mate Boban, his Bosnian Croat counterpart, have called for the creation of a loose confederation, which Mr Izetbegovic says will lead to more war and the possible annexation of large parts of Bosnia to Serbia and Croatia. The two peace envoys reportedly told Mr Izetbegovic that a newly created mainly Moslem state would receive economic aid from Moslem countries as well as the US. Mr Reginald Bartholomew, the special envoy of US president Bill Clinton who so far has maintained a distance from the peace talks, yesterday met Mr Izetbegovic for private talks. The mediators have pledged, in the event of the republic's ethnic division, that the mainly Moslem state would be granted at least 30 per cent of Bosnian territory and access to ports on the Adriatic Sea and the northern River Sava. They appear convinced, despite the upsurge in fighting in Bosnia, that Serb and Croat leaders would be willing to make territorial concessions to the Moslems. Serb forces control about 70 per cent of Bosnian territory and the Croats about 20 per cent. Mr Izetbegovic is likely to be sceptical that the international community will provide muscle to back the security of a Bosnian state. But Mr Mustafa Bijedic, chief of Bosnia's UN mission in Geneva, yesterday said: 'We were encouraged by the signs of support expressed by the co-chairmen.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Q. Can I obtain copies of reviewers' comments?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Upon written request, reviewers' comments will be mailed to unsuccessful applicants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Q. Is travel allowed under these projects?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Travel associated with carrying out the project is allowed. Because we will request the project directors and evaluators of funded projects to attend an annual project directors meeting, you should include annual trips for each to Washington, D.C., in the travel budget. Travel to conferences is sometimes allowed when it is for purposes of dissemination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Q. If my application receives high scores from the reviewers, does that mean that I will receive funding?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Not necessarily. It is often the case that the number of applications scored highly by the reviewers exceeds the dollars available for funding projects under a particular competition. The order of selection, which is based on the scores of all the applications and other relevant factors, determines the applications that can be funded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Q. What happens during negotiations?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. During negotiations technical and budget issues may be raised. These are issues that have been identified during the panel and staff reviews that require clarification. Sometimes issues are stated as ``conditions.'' These are issues that have been identified as so critical that the award cannot be made unless those conditions are met. Questions may also be raised about the proposed budget. Generally, these issues are raised because there is inadequate justification or explanation of a particular budget item, or because the budget item seems unimportant to the successful completion of the project. If you are asked to make changes that you feel could seriously affect the project's success, you may provide reasons for not making the changes or provide alternative suggestions. Similarly, if proposed budget reductions will, in your opinion, seriously affect the project activities, you may explain why and provide additional justification for the proposed expenses. An award cannot be made until all negotiation issues have been resolved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Q. How do I provide an assurance?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Except for SF&hyph;424B, ``Assurances_Non-Construction Programs,'' simply state in writing that you are meeting a proscribed requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Q. Where can copies of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , program regulations, and Federal statutes be obtained?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Copies of these materials can usually be found at your local library. If not, they can be obtained from the Government Printing Office by writing to: Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402. Telephone: (202) 783&hyph;3238. When requesting copies of regulations or statutes, it is helpful to use the specific name, public law number, or part number. The material referenced in this notice should be referred to as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Carl D.

What are the Department of Education's Program Effectiveness Panel and National Diffusion Network?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. The Program Effectiveness Panel (PEP) is the Department of Education's primary mechanism for validating the effectiveness of educational programs developed by schools, universities, and other agencies. The National Diffusion Network (NDN) is a Federally funded dissemination system that helps public and private schools, colleges, and other educational institutions improve by sharing successful education programs, products, and processes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulations governing PEP and NDN are codified at 34 CFR Parts 785&hyph;789. For information about PEP, prospective applicants may wish to read Making the Case: Evidence of Effectiveness in Schools and Classrooms, which contains criteria and guidelines for submitting project results to PEP. This publication, as well as information about NDN, is available from RMC Research Corporation, 1000 Market Street, Portsmouth, New Hampshire 03801. Telephone 1&hyph;800&hyph;258&hyph;0802.

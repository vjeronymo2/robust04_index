			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Brazil prison riot leaves 111 dead IN the worst prison violence in Brazilian history at least 111 inmates were killed and 35 injured as police quelled an uprising inside the country's largest prison. The rebellion at the overcrowded Casa de Detencao in Sao Paulo was apparently provoked by a clash between rival gangs. Inmates of Pavilion 9, which houses the most dangerous criminals, began attacking each other on Friday evening with clubs, knives and guns. They later barricaded themselves in with furniture and set fire to the block. After negotiations failed, 300 policemen stormed the jail and finally retook it after four hours of fighting. Most of the deaths resulted from gunshot wounds, according to officials who released the death toll on Saturday evening. No police officer was killed. Mr Luis Antonio Fleury, governor of Sao Paulo, ordered an inquiry into the police action. Mr Mauricio Correa, the new justice minister, said the jail system was in a state of collapse. The political parties which led the successful campaign to impeach ex-President Fernando Collor appear headed for victory in Brazil's municipal elections. Preliminary results for Saturday's first-round elections in more than 5,000 municipalities showed a significant shift to the left and a clear rejection of pro-Collor candidates of the Liberal Front (PFL) and National Reconstruction (PRN) parties.</p>

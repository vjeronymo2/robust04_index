			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Tax plan cheers investors Kenneth Clarke's efforts in last week's UK Budget to attract equity capital into unquoted companies seems to have struck a chord with the UK's business angels. Investors appear to be particularly enthusiastic about the extension of tax relief to cover capital gains made on the sale of any investment when the profits are re-invested in unquoted companies. Some angels say they have paid significant amounts of CGT which might otherwise have been invested in development capital in other companies. 'At the moment there is little in terms of tax benefits to encourage you to go out and do the hard work of finding these companies,' says John Milton, whose family has invested in a number of start-ups. Colin Sanders, who since selling his Solid State Logic electronics company to Carlton Communications has invested in about 18 ventures, is equally enthusiastic. 'The principle of deferring capital gains tax if you are going to invest in an (unquoted) manufacturing or trading company is an excellent idea,' says Sanders. 'It seems crazy that people build companies and then stay there getting bored,' Sanders says. Even worse for the economy are the entrepreneurs who do sell up but leave the UK for tax reasons, thereby draining the country not only of sources of capital but also their expertise. There are greater misgivings, however, about the Enterprise Investment Scheme which replaces the Business Expansion Scheme. Some angels fear that the Treasury may couch the EIS in so many rules and regulations that it fails to attract investors. But they are pleased that investors will be able to take an executive role in companies where they invest. 'I never did anything under BES because I believe that a key ingredient of success is to be actively involved in the business,' says Mark Fisher, an angel who has made a number of equity investments for over a decade, including one with 3i, the UK's largest investment capital group.</p>

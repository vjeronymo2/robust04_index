			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLAN WOULD REQUIRE ADDRESSES ON ROOF  </P> <P> In response to the fire that destroyed the Pan Pacific Auditorium, the Los  Angeles County Board of Supervisors has directed county attorneys to prepare an  ordinance that would require all high-rise buildings three stories and taller  to have their address on the roof.  </P> <P> Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who introduced the motion Wednesday, said the May  24 fire on the city's Westside "pointed out the need to improve our ability to  fully respond to major emergencies."  </P> <P> "The Fire Department had a great deal of difficulty in locating key buildings  in the area because there were no addresses visible to the aerial units," he  said.  </P> <P> Antonovich called the roof identification measure "an inexpensive requirement  that will substantially enhance our ability to protect lives and property."  </P></p>

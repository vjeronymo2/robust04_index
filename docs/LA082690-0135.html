			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROOKIE RECEIVER LIFTS RAMS  </P> <P> Two weeks before the season opener, the three-man battle for the Rams' starting  tailback job has given way to a three-man race at another position -- backup  receiver.  </P> <P> Who could have imagined in July that someone named Derrick Faison would push  Curt Warner out of the spotlight?  </P> <P> In the Rams' 27-7 victory over the Phoenix Cardinals before 44,134 at Anaheim  Stadium Saturday night, the tailback race between Gaston Green and Warner  fizzled for the moment. Green gained 21 yards in nine carries; Warner had 24  yards.  </P> <P> The fight for the team's No. 4 receiver spot, however, turned up a notch,  especially when the team's only healthy starter, Henry Ellard, left the game in  the first quarter because of a strained groin. Ellard did manage to get the  first reception of the summer for the starting receiving corps, catching a  nine-yard pass over the middle with 13:18 left in the first quarter.  </P> <P> The rest of the night was left for the likes of Faison, a rookie free agent who  is competing with Tim Stallworth and Tony Lomack for one open position.  </P> <P> Against Phoenix, Faison had scoring receptions of 26 and 23 yards and finished  with four catches for 73 yards, and he could have had more.  </P> <P> Faison beat his man deep in the first quarter but quarterback Jim Everett left  the pass short and Faison couldn't hold on to the ball. Faison came back with  an 11-yard reception later in the drive on a play in which his defender, Jay  Taylor, was called for pass interference.  </P> <P> In the second half, Faison added a 26-yard scoring reception to put the Rams  ahead, 20-0. Faison made that play while having his face-mask yanked by Tracey  Eaton.  </P> <P> In the fourth quarter, Faison made another juggling catch over the middle for a  23-yard touchdown, putting the Rams ahead by 20 points.  </P> <P> Who is Faison? He's a 6-foot-4 rookie from Howard University who played  basketball his senior year in college, not football.  </P> <P> "Obviously, Faison is capable of big plays," Coach John Robinson said. "He's  got some stuff that's unusual, I think all three men are going to play in the  NFL. We've got some decisions to make, but they've done an excellent job."  </P> <P> Nearly as impressive as Faison was Lomack, the ninth-round pick from Florida.  He finished with two catches for 91 yards, including an 80-yard scoring pass  from Everett late in the second quarter.  </P> <P> However, Lomack suffered a strained hamstring near the end of his scoring run  and couldn't return for the second half.  </P> <P> That left the door open for Stallworth, who didn't have a catch in the first  half. He made up for it with a difficult catch on a 27-yard pass from  quarterback Chuck Long on the Rams' first drive of the second half.  </P> <P> The biggest problem for the Ram receivers is health. When Stallworth was forced  from the game in the second half because of a bruised right toe, it left Faison  as the only available receiver with a chance to make the team. Also unavailable  were Ellard, Aaron Cox (hamstring) and Flipper Anderson (hamstring).  </P> <P> "I think I'm as worried about this football team as any that I've had coming  this close to the season," Robinson said. "We've had an unbelievable number of  injures. We lost Ellard again to groin, we don't think it's serious. But it's  the same routine, we can't seem to get any rhythm at wide receiver."  </P> <P> Everett received his most extensive work of the summer, playing the entire  first half. For the night, he completed 10 of 19 passes for 193 yards with one  touchdown and one interception.  </P> <P> Long had his best day as a Ram, completing seven of 10 passes for 155 yards and  two touchdowns.  </P> <P> The Rams' first score was set up by new corner Bobby Humphery, who intercepted  his second pass of the summer in the second quarter when he stepped in front of  a Timm Rosenbach pass and returned it nine yards to the Phoenix 22. Four plays  later, Mike Lansford kicked a 37-yard field goal to give the Rams a 3-0 lead.  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> Rookie free agent Derrick Faison started at wide receiver in place of Flipper  Anderson, who was sidelined because of a sore right hamstring. . . . Welcome to  the league: Former Indiana running back Anthony Thompson, the Cardinals' first  draft pick, was stopped for no gain on his first NFL carry after a crushing  tackle by safety Vince Newsome. Thompson ended his holdout with the team this  week.  </P> <P> These Rams did not play because of injuries: tackles Irv Pankey (back) and Rob  Cox (ribs), cornerback Darryl Henley (hip), Cleveland Gary (back), defensive  tackle Brian Smith (knee), linebackers Fred Strickland (hamstring) and Mel  Owens (back), receiver Aaron Cox and nose tackle Sean Smith (ankle).  </P></p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Celebrations have cautious overtones A few beers were being poured down the throats of British businesspeople in Kuala Lumpur last night. The ban on British companies being given contracts by the Malaysian government - contracts that are potentially worth many hundreds of millions of pounds - had been lifted. But the mood was not altogether joyous. Feelings of nervousness persist. One businessman summed things up: 'Of course we are happy that it's over. But all it needs is another incident where Mahathir feels his honour has been slighted. The balloon could easily go up again.' In recent years British companies have made considerable inroads in Malaysia. But then came the ban. Companies saw all they had worked for in danger of disappearing. Having courted the Malaysian bride for so long, British business was worried it might not be invited to the wedding. The ban was announced at the end of February this year. Malaysia had grown increasingly upset about the controversy in Britain surrounding a Dollars 240m aid package for building a dam, and its linkage to multi million dollar Malaysian purchases of British arms. But the spark that caused the Kuala Lumpur government anger to explode was a report in the London Sunday Times alleging that a British construction company had tried to offer bribes to Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister. Though the newspaper did not allege that Dr Mahathir had accepted bribes or had in any way been directly involved, the prime minister interpreted it in broader terms - a personal insult and an attempt to undermine the integrity of Malaysia's leadership. 'We believe the foreign media must learn the fact that many developing countries, including a country led by a brown Moslem, have the ability to manage their own affairs successfully,' said the government statement announcing the ban at the end of February. Some Malaysians felt that their prime minister was over-reacting but had little choice but to go along with the ban. Dr Mahathir, prime minister for the last 13 years, is a very powerful figure, influencing virtually every aspect of Malaysian life. From the beginning it was difficult to gauge exactly what he wanted in order for the ban to be lifted. 'All I want is the truth,' said Dr Mahathir. 'But then the British media is incapable of telling the truth.' Clearly the Malaysian government felt the British government should do more to disassociate itself from the media reports. But the official British reaction only added to the confusion: on the one hand Mr Major described the Malaysian action as 'not being remotely justified.' On the other, Mr Major's ministers - in public at least - joined with the massed ranks of British business in laying the blame for the Malaysian action squarely on the British media. There were other perplexing aspects to the ban. In many cases British companies found it was business as usual. British exports to Malaysia rose by about 80 per cent in the first six months of this year: ironically part of the reason for the jump in exports was the delivery to Malaysia of British defence equipment such as British Aerospace Hawker fighter aircraft, which was part of the controversial aid/defence package. But there are plenty of other contracts to win. Malaysia's economy has grown by more than 8 per cent in each of the last six years. The country plans to spend MDollars 40bn (Dollars 15.5bn) on various infrastructure projects over the next four years, MDollars 70bn by the end of the century. In 1981 Dr Mahathir, piqued at what he perceived as British high handedness on issues ranging from trade to high fees for Malaysian students in Britain, instituted a 'Buy British Last' policy. It was seven years before that ended. This ban has lasted only seven months.</p>

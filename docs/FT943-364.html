			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / International Company News: Alcatel warns of further decline as profits tumble Alcatel Alsthom, the French engineering, transport and telecoms group, yesterday warned of a sharp fall in full year profits to about FFr4bn (Dollars 754m), compared with FFr7.06bn in 1993. The announcement was prompted by losses at its German operations and difficulties in Brazil and Turkey. Mr Pierre Suard, chairman, said that the forecast confirmed his warning that 1994 would be a difficult year. But the expected decline is steeper than the 10 per cent to 20 per cent fall in net profits which he predicted in January. Announcing first-half profits of FFr2.02bn, a fall of 33 per cent on the first six months of last year, the Alcatel chairman said that the second-half results would be similar. He cited three specific problem areas for the decline. In Germany, the downturn had proved worse than had been expected in January. Mr Suard said that depressed demand and prices should result in a fall in sales of about 20 per cent this year at SEL, its German subsidiary, and losses of about Ecu200m (Dollars 162.7m). SEL is responding by restructuring its operations and reducing the 20,000 workforce by about 20 per cent by the end of next year. The group's operations in Brazil and Turkey are each expected to suffer exceptional losses of about FFr300m this year, Mr Suard said. In both countries, government austerity programmes had depressed demand while rising inflation had cut the value of contracts. Mr Suard said that 1994 was likely to be the low point of the group's fortunes and forecast an improvement in results in 1995. He said the company had won more than 40 per cent of the supply contracts for a cable telephone network in eastern Germany. In the US, Alcatel Network Systems had won contracts with US telecoms groups such as Pacific Bell and Bell Atlantic. The fall in profits comes at a sensitive time for the company. Mr Suard is one of a number of French business leaders to have been investigated in cases of alleged corruption, while his group is also engaged in a fierce contest to win France's third mobile telecoms licence. Government officials say a decision is expected soon.</p>

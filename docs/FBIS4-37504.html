			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by On Levi] </F>   [Text] "I can foresee the possibility of a joint  intelligence early warning system for us and the Arab states,"  Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur said in an interview with  the Defense Ministry employees' bulletin.    He said there is a possibility that satellites will provide  us and the Arabs with an early warning capability.    "We suppose the Arabs have also learned a lesson from the  Gulf war in all matters pertaining to defense on the home  front," Gur said.    According to Gur, "the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will have  to show us how to be a modern, professional, and thrifty army,  and at the same time remain a people's army." He said defense  needs and the numbers in recent drafts have not permitted the  Army to call up all candidates for military service. Some will  be sent for national service and will not be recruited to the  Army.    Gur said that "if we learn that the PLO leadership is  incapable of controlling most of the population and leading it  to real coexistence, the basic question will crop up about the  justification for the autonomy."    In reference to Iraq, Gur -- a former chief of staff -- said  that despite the fact that the Iraqi Army was seriously beaten  in the Gulf war, it still has over 30 army divisions and 400  aircraft. "Iraq also constitutes a serious nonconventional  threat. There is no certainty that even after all the  investigations inside Iraq we know about all they have," Gur  said.    He also said that the Home Front Command is prepared to  transfer allocation of gas masks to a civilian firm. He said  "we are now organizing for continued allocation of the masks and  if it becomes possible we will do it via a civilian business  firm."</p>

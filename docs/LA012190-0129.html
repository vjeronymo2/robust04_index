			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OTHER COMMENTARY / EXCERPTS;  </P> <P> A SHOCK TREATMENT THAT MAKES NO SENSE  </P> <P> The Moynihan proposal is the headiest political intoxicant Democrats have  sniffed in years. Their delight in it may yet overwhelm all sorts of  reservations.  </P> <P> The Reagan tax cuts, combined with indexing and the defense buildup,  approximately tripled the national debt, and no end of deficit spending is yet  in sight. The Republicans, despite the worries among their wiser heads, have  treated this fiscal insanity as a political opportunity.  </P> <P> Now insult has been added to injury, as the smarting Democrats see it, by the  1983 Social Security bailout. That bipartisan accord was designed to provide  for the eventual retirement, in massive numbers, of the baby-boom generation.  But pending that 21st-Century need, the scheduled payroll tax increases are  generating huge surpluses in the Social Security trust accounts. Those  surpluses provide fiscal padding for the GOP fiscal scam. They offer a  deceptive mask for the still-deepening operating deficit.  </P> <P> The idea, as budget-literate Democrats know, is risky in all sorts of ways,  beginning with the near certainty that in a congressional election year, cuts  in Social Security taxes will not be balanced by other, more progressive tax  increases.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Moynihan's maneuver is a brilliant political stroke, the first  really shrewd Democratic response in eight long, frustrating years of being  beaten to death by Republican tax-cut sloganeering.  </P></p>

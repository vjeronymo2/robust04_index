			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Church joins backlash over beggars The Church of England yesterday criticised the prime minister's remarks on beggars being an 'eyesore'. The Bishop of Liverpool, the Rt Rev David Sheppard, said: 'I find it a very unlovely feature of public life when people in power pick on the most despised groups in society rather than asking what the causes are.' Dr Sheppard, chairman of the Church of England's Board for Social Responsibility, told BBC Radio 4's Sunday programme: 'Politicians really have a responsibility not to mix up different issues.' He accepted that benefit fraud should be tackled and aggressive tramps reported to the police. 'But that is a tiny handful of cases and it is being used to justify a most draconian attack on very vulnerable people,' he added. Mr Major's comments have already been attacked by the opposition parties and charity groups dealing with the homeless. A study to be published this week by the homelessness charity Crisis says that one in four single homeless people has served in the forces and a high proportion of them are sleeping rough. The report, Falling Out, warns that the number of ex-service personnel on the streets could grow as the government implements large-scale redundancies. It says ex-service personnel are more disadvantaged than other homeless people because of the shock of leaving an ordered life.</p>

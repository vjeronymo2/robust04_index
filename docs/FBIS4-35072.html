			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Oridio Caballero, vice minister for </F> sugarcane, by reporter Diosdado Maso Perez for the "Exclusive"  program -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Maso] June will end in three days and the  completion of the spring cane sowing plan will be almost  impossible to meet. Therefore, I spoke with engineer Oridio  Caballero, Minaz [Ministry of the Sugar Industry] vice minister  for sugarcane. The important thing, the vice minister assured  me, is to continue sowing in July what cannot be sown now.  Various factors determined the failure to meet the spring sowing  plans in the country -- rain, fuel, and availability of seed  with a certain category, meaning seed quality. According to  Caballero, a supply of seed is now available after the required  work was done. All steps were taken to prepare a quality seed  supply.    [Caballero] This involves the handling of quality seeds in  each of the centers; the quality of the hydrothermal treatment  of these seeds; protection of the seed supplies; adequate  handling of seed varieties, which is very important; strict  compliance with phytosanitary measures; qualified and trained  personnel; attention to workers' social needs; and the aesthetic  qualities, from the technical agronomical viewpoint, that each  of the seed supplies must have.    [Maso] Vice minister, you know Cubans have a tendency to do  things sporadically. It would be interesting to know what will  be done to guarantee that what has been accomplished will not be  lost.    [Caballero] I would say this is a challenge, but we are  fully  convinced that we can manage it. First of all, I can tell you  that within the guidelines we established for the new Basic  Cooperative Production Units [UBPC's], it was clearly stated  that the state was responsible for everything dealing with the  seed varieties and phytosanitary issues. Judging from what we  have seen around here, what we have seen in all the UBPC's, and  what we have seen at each of the seed supply centers throughout  the country, we are convinced that we will accomplish this task  at the required level, at the prescribed level, from the  technical viewpoint. I also want to tell you that we are in a  better position than we were in 1986 and 1988 because we now  have the thermal treatment plants we did not have back then. Now  we can guarantee a quality seed system as never before.    [Maso] If we have seed, it is necessary to continue sowing,  not only in June and July, but also in August and September  because in the end, that is the sugarcane we will have for the  1995-96 harvest.</p>

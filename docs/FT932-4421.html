			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Frost shares tumble 22p SHARES IN Frost Group, the independent petrol retailer, fell 22p to 192p yesterday as the company warned that forecasts for 1993 in the petrol retailing industry were not good. Mr James Frost, chairman, said fuel sales for the first four months of this year were down nationally by some 1.83 per cent. In addition the Petrol Retailers Association was forecasting the closure of up to 6,000 of the UK's 18,500 sites over the next two to three years. He considered the prospective fall in sites 'alarmist and wildly exaggerated' but added that the adverse conditions presented Frost with expansion opportunities as there were a record number of sites for acquisition in solicitors' hands.</p>

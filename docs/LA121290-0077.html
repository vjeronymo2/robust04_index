			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DARK MOMENTS, FEAR HAUNT THE FREED HOSTAGES  </P> <P> With joyous family reunions and yellow ribbons bedecking the Main Streets of  dozens of small towns, America embraced its former hostages Tuesday, welcoming  them home in time for the holidays after months of fear and uncertainty over  their fate.  </P> <P> But as they seek to adjust to normal life after four months as fugitives in  Kuwait, or "human shields" in Iraq, many of the former hostages say they are  haunted by chilling memories that not even the joys of a holiday homecoming can  banish from their thoughts.  </P> <P> Peter Simard, a construction company manager from Boston, remembers most  vividly a moment that came suddenly and violently in the middle of the night,  when about a dozen heavily armed Iraqi soldiers burst into his apartment in  Kuwait city, taking him and several other foreigners hiding there prisoner.  </P> <P> Talmadge C. Ledford, a defense contractor from Windham, N.H., remembers not so  much a moment as a constant, gnawing fear that a "call would come from Baghdad"  and that he and the other Westerners being held as human shields at a Kuwaiti  oil installation would be executed.  </P> <P> "There was no question in our minds" that if an order to kill them "came down  from Saddam Hussein, it would have been followed," Ledford said.  </P> <P> And Donald Latham, an Albuquerque, N.M., engineer working on a defense project  in Kuwait, went through an experience that even now he will not talk about.  </P> <P> "We're not going to say anything about that at all, OK? It just didn't happen.  . . . Just forget it, please just forget it. . . ," he said when asked about  news reports that he killed a looter who broke into his apartment one night.  </P> <P> Whether they huddled in fear in darkened apartments and other hide-outs  provided by resistance fighters in Kuwait or spent months in Iraq being moved  in the middle of the night from one strategic site to another, the hundreds of  Americans swept up in the crisis that erupted with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait  on Aug. 2 all came home with tales of hardship, if not outright terror.  </P> <P> One man, held at what he assumed to be a weapons testing complex southwest of  Baghdad, lived with the sound of continual explosions -- and the fear that he  and his fellow hostages would be killed not by a U.S. air strike but by "Iraqi  incompetence" if a munitions test went awry.  </P> <P> Cleveland businessman Jeff Sanislo recalled the fear that made his stomach knot  when Iraqi troops spotted him hiding on the roof of an apartment building in  Kuwait city. To escape capture, he squeezed into a 2-foot-high box on the roof,  waiting silently for four hours until Kuwaiti resistance forces helped him  escape.  </P> <P> "You pray a lot at a time like that," Sanislo said. "You think about family. .  . . 'Will I ever get to see them again?' You get faith real quick."  </P> <P> And yet for many former hostages recounting their stories, it wasn't the  flashes of fear or the hardships of prison camp life that marked their ordeal  so much as it was the boredom and the anxiety of not knowing how or when it  would end.  </P> <P> "The boredom was something that would just drive you up the wall," said Al  Stone, a construction company manager from Las Vegas who spent more than three  months hiding in a two-room apartment whose doors were welded shut by Kuwaitis  attempting to keep him from being discovered.  </P> <P> "It was the tension, the tension and the stress. Your stomach was always tied  up in knots," said 69-year-old Eugene Hughes of Albuquerque, N.M., a former  pilot who was visiting his stepson, Donald Latham, when the Iraqis invaded  Kuwait.  </P> <P> At one point, Iraqi troops surrounded the two-story villa where Hughes and  Latham were hiding in Latham's second floor apartment. "They rang the bell and  rattled the gate, but I guess they weren't sure we were inside because they  went away eventually," Hughes said.  </P> <P> Jack Hogan, 54, of San Diego, urged President Bush to get tough.  </P> <P> "I haven't yet met a hostage who didn't want the military to come in and take  it to him," Hogan said of Hussein. "He's nothing but a thug."  </P> <P> Like most of the Americans who managed to evade the house-to-house searches by  Iraqi troops, Hughes and Latham credited the Kuwaiti resistance with saving  their lives -- sometimes at the cost of their own.  </P> <P> "The people, the beautiful people of Kuwait kept us free," Hughes said in a  voice choking with emotion. "They brought us food and kept our whereabouts  secret. We would not be here today if it was not for them.  </P> <P> "They're running an elaborate protection service for the foreigners there,"  added Latham. "Anyone who needs medical help, the resistance gets him a doctor.  Anybody who needs food, they get him food. If you needed money, you got that  too."  </P> <P> John Gerald Jr., a lawyer from North Myrtle Beach, Va., said the flies and  mosquitoes were "incessant" at the munitions testing site where he and six  other foreigners were held.  </P> <P> "Had the Iraqis allowed care packages through, my first request would have been  for bug spray," he said.  </P> <P> Gerald said his Iraqi captors told him he was being held at a "screwdriver  manufacturing plant" and that the bunkers he saw were "archeological digs." He  said he assumed they were at a munitions testing site because of the periodic  explosions he heard. "I never saw a single screwdriver," he added.  </P> <P> While Gerald remained at the munitions site for his entire captivity, other  hostages said they were moved from one site to another, always in the dead of  night. Bill Rodebush, an oil rig maintenance engineer from McAlester, Okla.,  spent time at a heavily fortified chemical factory near the Syrian border, a  hydroelectric plant near the Iranian frontier, a military complex in northern  Iraq and an ammunition plant south of Baghdad. He said one of his captors told  him the hostages were moved often because the officers didn't want them "to get  friendly with any of our guards."  </P> <P> For most of the human shields, as well as the fugitives in Kuwait, the light at  the end of what one described as their "long and terrible tunnel" first  appeared on Saturday, when word came through that Iraqi President Saddam  Hussein had ordered their release.  </P> <P> Hughes recalled the sense of shock he felt Sunday at the sight of the streets  of Kuwait city on the way to the airport where he and about 75 other Americans  boarded a U.S.-chartered flight to Baghdad on the way to Frankfurt, Germany.  </P> <P> "When I arrived, it was such a beautiful city . . . but when I left, it was a  garbage dump. Garbage was everywhere, and all the buildings were burnt, shot up  or torn down. It was sickening to see what devastation the Iraqis had done."  </P> <P> Cheers went up as the plane carrying them to freedom left Baghdad -- but there  was yet one more moment of fear the newly released hostages would have to  endure.  </P> <P> Just as the plane was about to touch down in Frankfurt early Monday, the Iraqi  pilot jerked back the throttle and nosed the plane back into the sky. "We all  thought the same thing, that we were going back to Baghdad, and we immediately  began to make plans to hijack the plane," Hughes recalled. "And we weren't  kidding. We were really going to overpower the crew, and I was going to land  the plane."  </P> <P> But just as the passengers were about to make their move, it became clear that  the pilot was circling to make another landing because he had botched his first  approach.  </P></p>

			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Sedgwick raises Pounds 144m to fund deals SEDGWICK, one of the UK's biggest insurance brokers, yesterday launched a Pounds 143.7m rights issue to fund two acquisitions. The main target is Noble Lowndes, the employee benefits consultancy, which it has agreed to buy from TSB Group for Pounds 110m. Funding will come from a one-for-five rights issue of 90.7m shares at 165p each. The company's shares closed down 15p yesterday at 191p. The announcement came as the group unveiled pre-tax profits up 4 per cent to Pounds 54.1m in the six months to June 30. The group has also agreed in principle to buy Arvid Bergvall, a Scandinavian marine insurance broker, for a maximum of NKr196m (Pounds 17.8m). Up to 90 per cent of the purchase will be satisfied in cash, with the rest in Sedgwick shares. Noble Lowndes, which is based in the UK, employs 2,750 staff in 44 locations around the world. Its services include pensions advice, employee benefits and personal financial services consulting. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 11.5m in the year to October 31 1992. Mr Tarrant said all Noble Lowndes' senior management would be transferred except Mr Carl Daniels, the chairman and chief executive, who was retiring. The managing director's role was being split into two, for Europe and the rest of the world. Transamerica International, which owns 24.1 per cent of Sedgwick, supported the rights issue and will partially subscribe, reducing its stake to 21 per cent. The closing date for acceptances is September 7. The issue is fully underwritten by NM Rothschild and SG Warburg. Sedgwick's interim turnover rose to Pounds 379.6m from Pounds 323.3m. Earnings per share increased by 0.1p to 7.5p and the dividend remained unchanged at 3p. Pre-tax profits from insurance and reinsurance rose to Pounds 55.7m (Pounds 55.3m) and from employee benefits consulting to Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 3.3m). Profits from insurance underwriting fell to Pounds 0.3m (Pounds 0.7m) and the Lloyd's underwriting business made a loss of Pounds 0.4m (loss of Pounds 0.7m). 'It's a mixed bag,' said Mr Stuart Tarrant, group finance director. 'Reinsurance has been extremely difficult. We are happy with the premiums but there is just not the capacity around.' Exchange rate movements contributed Pounds 11.1m to pre-tax profits during the period. Interest and investment income fell to Pounds 21.6m (Pounds 26.3m). Details, Page 20; Lex, Page 18</p>

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Where the main thrust of the DTI's new competitive policy will be focused ...: Competitiveness WITH the DTI's 12,450 staff committed to 'championing competitiveness' - the best available definition of the government's present industrial policy - the competitiveness division inevitably lies at the core of the department's activities. The establishment last July of the division was among Mr Heseltine's first initiatives on arrival at the department. Mr Bob Dobbie, an under-secretary, was put in charge and instructed, along with his colleagues, to 'travel the world' to size up the competition and assess Britain's weaknesses and strengths. Mr Dobbie and his team start with the knowledge that, in spite of some useful improvements in productivity during the 1980s, Britain stands 18th in a competitiveness league table of OECD countries. Mr Heseltine says the government has a legitimate role, albeit a limited one, in improving the UK's position. At present, the division has a team in the Far East, while another group has just returned from Australia, Singapore and New Zealand. Responsibilities of the division - which currently has secondees from KPMG Peat Marwick and Ernst &amp; Young - include an international appraisal of competitiveness among major trading nations. Policies which effect competitive performance, ranging from education and training through to competition policy and inward investment, are put under the microscope. The intention is to add first-hand, quality information to the more usual data bases. The division, apart from being charged with spreading the competitive message within the DTI itself, is also keen to nurture its own contacts with companies and representative organisations. But it also has a more difficult task - that of trying to cajole and persuade other departments to follow the same banner. While Mr Heseltine pledges to battle away behind closed doors - in cabinet and cabinet committees - to ensure industry's case is heard, the division is expected to mirror his efforts at less exalted levels, trying to prevent other departments inflicting the competitive 'own goals' of which industry regularly complains. Though such intervention may not always prove popular, a senior official of the division claims a more constructive phase of inter-departmental dialogue is under way. The DTI, he adds, is also learning. There has been a 'decided shift of emphasis' towards a better understanding of what other departments are trying to achieve.</p>

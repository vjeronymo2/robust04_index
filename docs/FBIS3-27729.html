Tanaka earlier told Hosokawa that he would serve as special  adviser until Diet debate on political reform ended, the top  government spokesman told a news conference.    The government's political reform package, aimed at rooting  out political graft, cleared the Diet on Saturday after Hosokawa  and Yohei Kono, president of the main opposition Liberal  Democratic Party, struck a deal on making modifications in the  next regular Diet session.    Tanaka, the No. 2 man of Sakigake (Harbinger), a small  component of Hosokawa's seven-party coalition, will concentrate  on party affairs from now on, said Takemura, who heads Sakigake.  He has pledged his continued support for Hosokawa, according to  the chief cabinet secretary.    Takemura said Tanaka's resignation has nothing to do with  his  remarks last week suggesting Hosokawa would disband the cabinet  and step down from power if his political reform bid ended in  failure.    Tanaka, 53, has been elected to the House of Representatives  three times from the No. 1 constituency of Nagano Prefecture.</p>

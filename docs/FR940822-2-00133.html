			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An application requesting a package grant for more than one project must describe separately the tasks associated with each project in the proposed package. Each project must be identified by a separate letter of the alphabet (i.e., A, B, C) and a descriptive title.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Evaluation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Every project design must include an evaluation plan to determine whether the project met its objectives. The evaluation should be designed to provide an objective and independent assessment of the effectiveness or usefulness of the training or services provided; the impact of the procedures, technology or services tested; or the validity and applicability of the research conducted. In addition, where appropriate, the evaluation process should be designed to provide ongoing or periodic feedback on the effectiveness or utility of particular programs, educational offerings, or achievements which can then be further refined as a result of the evaluation process. The plan should present the qualifications of the evaluator(s); describe the criteria, related to the project's programmatic objectives, that will be used to evaluate the project's effectiveness; explain how the evaluation will be conducted, including the specific data collection and analysis techniques to be used; discuss why this approach is appropriate; and present a schedule for completion of the evaluation within the proposed project period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The evaluation plan should be appropriate to the type of project proposed. For example:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. An evaluation approach suited to many  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> research  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> projects is a review by an advisory panel of the research methodology, data collection instruments, preliminary analyses, and products as they are drafted. The panel should be comprised of independent researchers and practitioners representing the perspectives affected by the proposed project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ii. The most valuable approaches to evaluating  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> educational or training  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> programs will serve to reinforce the participants' learning experience while providing useful feedback on the impact of the program and possible areas for improvement. One appropriate evaluation approach is to assess the acquisition of new knowledge, skills, attitudes or understanding through participant feedback on the seminar or training event. Such feedback might include a self-assessment on what was learned along with the participant's response to the quality and effectiveness of faculty presentations, the format of sessions, the value or usefulness of the material presented and other relevant factors. Another appropriate approach would be to use an independent observer who might request verbal as well as written responses from participants in the program. When an education project involves the development of curricular materials an advisory panel of relevant experts can be coupled with a test of the curriculum to obtain the reactions of participants and faculty as indicated above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iii. The evaluation plan for a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> demonstration  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> project should encompass an assessment of program effectiveness (e.g., how well did it work?); user satisfaction, if appropriate; the cost-effectiveness of the program; a process analysis of the program (e.g., was the program implemented as designed? did it provide the services intended to the targeted population?); the impact of the program (e.g., what effect did the program have on the court? what benefits resulted from the program?); and the replicability of the program or components of the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iv. For  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> technical assistance  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> projects, applicants should explain how the quality, timeliness, and impact of the assistance provided will be determined, and should develop a mechanism for feedback from both the users and providers of the technical assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> v. Evaluation plans involving  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> human subjects  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> should include a discussion of the procedures for obtaining respondents' informed consent, ensuring the respondents' privacy and freedom from risk or harm, and the protection of others who are not the subjects of evaluation but would be affected by it. Other than the provision of confidentiality to respondents, human subjects protection issues ordinarily are not applicable to participants evaluating an education program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vi. The evaluation plan in a package grant application should address the issues listed above for the particular types of projects included in the package, assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the individual components as well as the benefits and limitations of the projects as a package.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Investors offer tepid response to Milan's new image - The long-awaited reforms have not delivered the expected rise in turnover This year should be the watershed for Italian equities, thanks to new laws bringing unprecedented transparency to the market and boosting liquidity by curtailing off-floor trading. The stalking horse for the changes is the new Societa di Intermediazione Mobiliare (Sim), Italy's novel form of broking, underwriting and fund management hybrid. The Sims are set to revolutionise the bourse, thanks to their high capital requirements and the much tougher reporting rules. Although many of Italy's small, privately-owned stockbrokers are still in business, most have set up Sims, either independently or in conjunction with more powerful banking partners. Such alliances have helped many overcome what looks set to be a fierce battle against a background of high costs following the introduction of screen-based trading at the same time as commissions are whittled down by increased competition. However, early results from the Sims have been mixed. Although the market's image has improved, providing a temporary boost to confidence and volume at the start of the year, turnover has not surged as many brokers hoped. Daily trading has hovered around L100bn (Dollars 83m). The Comit index closed at 536.57 yesterday, up 3.49 on the day, and up 6.3 per cent since the end of 1991. That has not lifted the mood among many brokers, who complain of the much higher cost base they now face. According to a study this week by Banca Commerciale Italiana, a medium-sized Sim would need a daily turnover of between L6bn and L13bn to make an acceptable return on its capital. Some dealers blame the market's relatively low turnover on teething troubles with software and the fact that only a handful of Sims were ready when the new law came into force this year. However, most acknowledge that the explanation for the relatively small increase in turnover this year is based more on fundamentals than technical hitches. The prime cause for investors' tepid response to the Sims is political uncertainty ahead of April's general elections. The widespread expectation of a weak government and deeper political divisions has dented hopes of getting to grips with Italy's spiralling budget deficit. Figures confirming that the recession is growing and pointing to unfavourable 1991 earnings have exacerbated the gloomy short-term expectations. Last month's preliminary results from Fiat suggested that 1991 net profits would slump to around L1,100bn; Olivetti stands to lose at least L290bn, and probably more, depending on the allocation of restructuring. Special situations have at least added a touch of spice to the market. Legislation approved last month introducing greater protection for minority shareholders' rights in takeover bids has focused speculative interest on some stocks which might be affected by the new rules. Cementir, the cement group controlled by the IRI state holding company, topped the list. Its stock has been driven in recent weeks by investors hoping that IRI's plan to sell its 51.78 per cent holding would oblige the buyer to launch a full bid. As it happened, this week's L480bn sale of the stake to the Rome-based Caltagirone building group did not trigger the bonanza speculators had been banking on. The deal was concluded just before the law came into effect. Hence minority shareholders in Cementir had no chance to share in the reward, despite the fact that Caltagirone paid a 100 per cent premium to the current market price. Both stocks fell heavily following the announcement. Despite the disappointment, the new takeover law, whose complexities are being mastered by the lawyers, is still fuelling speculation in other stocks, particularly companies where the stock market float is very thin. Standa, the stores group which is majority owned by Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest concern, this week became the latest focus of such attention. The market expects further privatisation deals following the government's approval for a law to boost the sale of state-owned assets this year. And the prospect of further bourse reforms, including the arrival of cash settlement and futures and options, could lift the market further, as could the arrival of big institutional money should Italy authorise the creation of pension funds. Once the elections are out of the way, investors may turn their attention again to market reforms and the stream of new flotations probably in the pipeline for this year. The initial public offering for Istituto San Paolo di Torino, the big Turin-based banking group, will feature prominently on most lists. Pencilled in for early April, the San Paolo deal should raise around L1,500bn and get the flotation season off to a strong start in view of the bank's high reputation. San Paolo will be one of Italy's first bid public-sector banks to use new banking liberalisation to float part of its equity, and the deal should also be helped by the relative scarcity of such paper. Further down the road are possible initial public offerings for a number of other public-sector companies. Agip and Snam, two subsidiaries of the Eni energy and chemicals group, and Ilva, IRI's steel-making arm, are all tipped for a 1992 stock market debut. With most of the legal framework for a well-functioning market now in place, Italy has now overcome most of the structural barriers to a more liquid equity market and wider share ownership. With a new flotation wave in sight, political factors are the single most important factor in whether the bourse will realise it new potential.</p>

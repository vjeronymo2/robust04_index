King Husayn's  political adviser Marwan al-Qasim told our radio that if the PLO  leadership now thinks that there should be a revision or a  postponement of this subject, then Jordan can only respect the  independent Palestinian decision.    Al-Qasim noted that Jordan's aim behind the agreement, which  has been ready for the signature of Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat for two months, is to extend assistance and support for  the Palestinian people and fill the financial and economic  vacuum in the transitional period until the Palestinian side  takes over the banking authority.    Al-Qasim recalled that the Jordanian move came in response  to  a desire expressed by the Palestinians since the beginning of  joint coordination which began with the peace process. The  agreement was a result of this coordination, he added. Al-Qasim  said that the decision to reopen Jordanian banks in the West  Bank was made in 1985 within a joint agreement aimed at  extending banking services which would have a vital effect on  reactivating the economic conditions and enabling the  Palestinian people to adhere to their land.    One bank has been operating in the West Bank since 1986,  which is the Cairo-Amman Bank. However, since the  Israeli-Jordanian economic agreement was signed earlier this  month on reopening Jordanian banks in the occupied territories,  eight Jordanian banks have expressed interest to operate there.</p>

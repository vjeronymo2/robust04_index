			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Rolls-Royce job cuts rise THE number of staff to be shed at the Rolls-Royce aero-engine plant in Bristol has been increased by 200, and may reach 1,000, it was announced yesterday. Union officials have been warned of possible compulsory redundancies in the company's 8,000-strong workforce if the job cuts are not met through voluntary redundancies and early retirement. The unions have blamed the lack of volunteers on poor pay-offs - the maximum being Pounds 4,000. Rolls-Royce blamed the company's 3,000 job losses in the UK on the recession worldwide and the effect of the Gulf war on international air-lines. In January the company announced job cuts of between 1,200 and 1,500 jobs at its Derby commercial aero-engine operations. Derby, where most of Rolls-Royce's commercial engine business is based, employs about 15,000 people.</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Building societies warned on market BUILDING SOCIETIES cannot rely on a housing market recovery and need to restructure in order to remain profitable, Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank, says in a report issued today. The 'great British love affair with owner-occupied housing' may be coming to an end, the report says. When house prices recover, they may simply rise in parallel with inflation. As a result, building society profits may not recover to their 1989 levels until the end of the century. 'Larger societies are being boxed in by their dependence on the housing market' and will need to look for 'radical structural solutions', the report says. Morgan Grenfell says it would make sense for the larger building societies 'simply to metamorphose into mutually owned banks'. Other alternatives are to abandon their mutual status and convert into banks, merge with insurance companies or be taken over by domestic or foreign banks. The building societies have relied on making money out of their borrowers but have not paid attention to their more numerous savers, according to Mr John Franklin, of Morgan Grenfell's corporate finance division. 'They are going to have to look towards providing a service to their savers. This is an under-exploited side of their business.' It would mean providing equity-based investments such as personal equity plans and unit trusts, which might require a change in legislation. The societies could also widen their lending practices by developing their credit card and personal-loan operations. They have a foothold in the insurance market through the sale of insurance-related products for mortgages. Morgan Grenfell predicts that if low rates of interest and inflation continue, repayment mortgages will become cheaper than endowments and, given the bad publicity endowment mortgages have received, that might kill them off. The larger societies have more in common with the banks than with their smaller brethren, says the report, which finds it increasingly meaningless to talk about building societies as a single homogeneous group. The smaller building societies lack the resources to expand, and the report finds it difficult to foresee a profitable future for them. During 1991, there were seven completed mergers and takeovers, and Morgan Grenfell stands by its prediction last year that the number of societies will fall to 50 by the end of the decade.

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Debt convergence theory comes under pressure THE convergence theory, which has provided the intellectual backbone to most investors' trading strategies in the European bond markets in recent times, was looking distinctly shaky yesterday. 'It is largely, if not completely, blown out of the water,' was the conclusion of one large UK fixed income investor. Like others, he had expected pressures to build up in the ERM, diverting EC member states from their march towards monetary and economic union - though not with the speed shown by the sudden swing of sentiment in the foreign exchanges on Wednesday. 'We certainly didn't expect it to happen as quickly or as violently as it did,' he said. The virtual ejection of sterling and the Italian lira from the ERM, and the devaluation of the peseta, left investors yesterday casting around for the next theory on which to hang their investment plans. Whether to sell bonds and buy gilts, and which European currencies now offer the best profit potential, were just two of the questions over which investors were scratching their heads. Some fundamental investment strategies are likely to be altered in the days and weeks ahead. 'We haven't convened the asset allocation committee yet,' said Mr David Shaw, head of fixed income investment at Legal &amp; General, the UK insurer. That will only happen after the French referendum this weekend, which investors hope will give a clearer indication of where the ERM goes from here. L&amp;G has been one of the standard-bearers of the move by some UK insurers away from equities and into gilts, prompted by a belief that the discipline of the ERM made the outperformance of equities a thing of the past. Mr Shaw said yesterday: 'That was based on the assumption that we were a fully paid-up member of the ERM. That is now subject to almost daily review. We haven't reached any conclusion here yet - we are waiting for an economic statement from the government.' While investors wait for the political fog in the UK to part and a clearer indication to emerge of the way forward for UK economic policy, the markets were busy yesterday making up the government's mind for it: short-dated gilt prices tumbled in anticipation of UK base rates falling smartly, while sterling remained well below its former floor in the ERM. Longer-dated gilts, though, reflected only a hint of the possible implications of a devaluation and return to the UK's old inflationary ways. 'People have factored-in continental European-type inflation for the UK of 3 per cent,' one investor said. 'Now, people will have to put it closer to 5 per cent. On that basis, gilts are not very good value.' Much depends on whether an attempt is made in the coming days to weld sterling and the lira back on to the ERM - and whether the peseta can stay tied. If so, then some investors were arguing yesterday that the convergence process could restart - and could actually be stronger than before. If a lower parity for currencies such as sterling allowed interest rates to fall, then economic recovery would come faster. That would lead to tax revenues climbing, helping European states to get a firmer grip on their fiscal deficits. That, in turn, would make it easier for countries to hit the Maastricht convergence criteria, making monetary union more rather than less likely. There were few believers in this theory yesterday, however. 'As and when the ERM finally blows itself apart, the market will come back to valuing markets on fundamentals,' one investor said. And then convergence really would be a thing of the past.</p>

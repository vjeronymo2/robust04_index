			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Arts: Fine twists to Veronica's Room - Theatre Ira Levin has written some fine thrillers, including Rosemary's Baby, The Stepford Wives and The Boys From Brazil. He has been mining a rich psychological seam below the surface of ordinary life. Now the Haymarket Theatre Basingstoke has found a little 90 minute nugget by Levin called Veronica's Room. It is clever, knotty, scary and well worth seeing. The plot is a gem. It is 1973. Susan and Larry are spotted in a restaurant by an Irish couple, Maureen and John, who claim Susan is the image of their dead employers' dead daughter, Veronica. They persuade Susan to dress up as Veronica from the 1930s, and plunge her into a nightmare role-play by appearing as their employers, Veronica's parents. The more Susan-Veronica protests it is 1973, the madder she seems. There are two fine twists too good to reveal. Levin writes about psychoses or disorders by confining them to one place, as he does in his novel Sliver where the action is set in one high-rise. In Veronica's Room beneath the gloss of Nixon's America lies the normalcy of Roosevelt's and beneath that a cesspool of incest, murder and guilt. The play looks apt for 1990s America, too, because it is all about memories and false memories of childhood. There is now a support group for those people suffering from False Memory Syndrome: they thought they were abused in childhood but turn out not to be and still suffer as if they had been, a lose-lose situation. The play is more made-for-TV than stage, and the actors who have to make big gestures out of small but vital details are sometimes like the cartoon characters flailing in mid-air and getting nowhere. There is still a rough edge to the central performances from Frances White (Maureen), Catherine Cusack (Susan) and Duncan Law (Larry), but they should learn from the excellent William Franklyn (John) who plays everything pared down and understated. The oppressive set (Elroy Ashmore) works well in the refurbished Haymarket to turn intimacy with the stage into claustrophobia. Adrian Reynolds' direction is hampered by the necessary interval (theatre bars contribute substantially to income). If the Haymarket can maintain this level of energy and invention, it will have a good year. The Haymarket Theatre, Basingstoke (0256 465566) until January 29</p>

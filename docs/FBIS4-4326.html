			<p>CSO     [Text] The Labor Division of the Surabaya Legal Aid Society  (LBH) has demanded that the government rescind Minister of  Manpower Regulation (Permenaker) Number Per-01/MEN/1994 which  regulates labor unions at the company level, making reference to  various contradictions between clauses in those regulations.    Munir, head of the Labor Division of the Surabaya Legal Aid  Society, said that this year the Minister of Manpower (Menaker)  has issued a set of labor regulations which were set forth in  Minister of Manpower Regulation Number Kep. 15A/MEN/1994 dated 4  January 1994, concerning Guidelines for Resolving Labor  Relations Disputes and Lay-offs at the Company Level, followed  up at a later date by Permenaker Number 01/MEN/1994, which  regulates labor unions at the company level. However, said  Munir, several clauses in those two regulations are mutually  contradictory.    "These inconsistent regulations are very worrisome,  especially when we find out that a ministerial board had made  those regulations," Munir told the press here yesterday.    Munir mentioned several contradictory clauses in those  regulations; for example article 3 (b) of Kep. 15A/MEN/1994  states that complaints can be resolved either via a leader of a  labor union registered with the Department of Manpower or via  another labor organization. And article 4 (a) states that in  order to reach mutual agreement discussions will be carried out  with a labor union or an association of labor unions registered  with the Department of Manpower or another labor organization.    "This clause therefore guarantees the workers the right to  set up a labor union other than the SPSI [All-Indonesia Labor  Union], which is the organization registered with the Department  of Manpower. However, Munir explained, the clause is  contradicted by a regulation issued at a later date, i.e.,  Permenaker Number Per-01/MEN/1994. Article 1 (e) of Section I  states that the Labor Union is the All-Indonesia Labor Union  (SPSI).    This is where the contradiction lies; one of the labor  regulations states that a minister can decide that a company can  have a labor union other than the SPSI, but another regulation  states that only the SPSI can exist within a company," Munir  asserted.    Not to speak of a clause which, Munir said, is completely  incomprehensible and has no force as a legal directive. The  confusing proviso, set forth in article 22 of Permenaker Number  01/MEN/1994, reads as follows: a business may not forbid a  company-level union from becoming a labor union.    That is why the Labor Division of the Surabaya Legal Aid  Society, in its letter addressed to the Minister of Manpower of  the Republic of Indonesia, demanded the rescission of Permenaker  Number 01/MEN/1994, because it considered it inconsistent with  previously issued regulations.    "We have expressed our deepest concern over this  inconsistent  policy, which debases the law," Munir asserted.    This is especially so in relation to Law Number 28 of 1956  concerning the right to organize and to hold joint meetings,  which ratified the International Labor Organization (ILO)  Convention Number 98 of 1949 and Labor Act Number 14 of 1969,  which emphasized that in principle workers are free to organize  themselves in any form of organization whatsoever, not just in  an obligatory union such as the SPSI.    It was stated in the letter, a copy of which was sent to  President Suharto, that legal developments and improvements will  be hampered if there continue to be inconsistent policies  dealing with labor problems.    "These contradictory regulations show that the Indonesian  government is not building a healthy democratic climate which  acknowledges in a fundamental way the rights of workers to  organize, as ruled in the Constitution."</p>

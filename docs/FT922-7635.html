			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Accountants' pay rise trails national average at 6.3% ACCOUNTANTS' salaries grew by less than the average increase in UK earnings last year in the face of large-scale redundancies, the annual survey from Robert Half, financial recruitment consultants, showed yesterday. Salaries rose 6.3 per cent, compared with 8.1 per cent in 1990-91 and a peak of 13 per cent in 1988-89. UK average earnings in the year to February, published on Wednesday, grew by 7.5 per cent. According to the survey, the top 20 firms made about 1,000 professionals redundant in 1991, and a further 2,000 from other firms lost their jobs. It said that just over half of the companies questioned made staff redundant. The proportion was highest in the west Midlands, where 61 per cent of companies shed employees. Most who lost their jobs were clerical staff. Recruitment advertising declined by 60 per cent last year, while 21 per cent of companies reported more than 200 replies to a single advertised vacancy. Mr Grout said that while the quantity of job applicants had risen, the quality had not, although he expected many higher-calibre candidates who are currently employed to change jobs in the second half of the year. Demand for individuals who have qualified with the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants was now higher than the demand for chartered accountants, reflecting their greater commercial experience. Nearly 60 per cent of companies offer some form of bonus in addition to salary. Two fifths offer share options and season ticket loans and 28 per cent have profit-sharing schemes. The proportion of companies offering benefits was down slightly on previous years, although Mr Grout said there was an increase in a 'flexible menu' of benefits. The estimated cost of two outstanding investigations by the accountancy profession's joint disciplinary scheme is almost Pounds 1m, its annual report showed yesterday. A committee of inquiry into matters surrounding the Barlow Clowes group of companies, and another concerned with Minet Holdings, WMD Underwriting Agencies and Alexander Howden Group, are expected to cost Pounds 925,000 before resolution. A third case into Milbury and Westminster Property Group was concluded last November after incurring costs of Pounds 224,000.</p>

			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LIMITING THE POPULATION IN CAMPAIGN TO CUT SMOG  </P> <P> In your editorial (Dec. 6) on the recent Orange County Annual Survey, you  seemed to suggest the problem of smog could be helped by each of us doing a  little less polluting by curtailing our dependence on such things as gasoline  lawn mowers and barbecue lighting fluid.  </P> <P> I believe any measures can, at most, give only temporary relief. Without  setting, and enforcing, some limit to the population of our county, there can  be no long-term benefit to its environment. There is no measure that can be  taken that will not be overwhelmed by the lethality of the unrestrained growth  such as we have suffered in the last generation.  </P> <P> So long as our population increases, our environment will deteriorate. The  degradation in our quality of living will only end when the population has  become stable.  </P> <P> JOHN FERGUSON  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

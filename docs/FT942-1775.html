			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Region severely affected by the global downtrend The sharp fall in international stock and bond prices dampened confidence, and the Nikkei 225 average dropped 1.6 per cent to below the 21,000 level for the first time since June 6, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index surrendered 338.87 at 20,813.16 on profit-taking and arbitrage selling, having opened at the day's high of 21,076.22 before falling through 21,000 in early trading. It hit a low of 20,759.45 just before the close. The Topix index of all first section stocks plunged 20.50 to 1,663.97, while the Nikkei 300 shed 4.12 to 301.52. Declines led gainers by 948 to 130, with 118 issues unchanged. Volume dipped to 380m shares from 416m as most investors remained inactive as the yen strengthened against the dollar. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.83 to 1,354.17. Dealers and arbitrageurs liquidated index-linked positions, while some domestic institutions and foreigners were seen bargain hunting around the day's lows. A Japanese broker said the Nikkei 225 appeared to have found technical support around 20,900, but he added that the next support level was around the 75-day average of 20,260. High-technology issues continued to face selling on worries over the yen's appreciation. NEC declined Y30 to Y1,240 and Sony Y120 to Y6,160. Automobile stocks were also weak, with Toyota Motor receding Y30 to Y2,170 and Honda Motor Y40 to Y1,890. Mitsubishi Oil, the day's most active issue, bucked the trend by rising Y50 to Y1,050. Reports that it had discovered oil off the coast of Vietnam prompted active buying. The rise in long bond yields hurt interest rate-sensitive utility shares. Electric power companies were among stocks hitting lows for the year, with Chubu Electric Power down Y30 to Y2,580 and Kansai Electric Power off Y20 at Y2,570. Large-capital issues were down on profit-taking, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries slipping Y11 to Y771. The rise in gold and other metal prices supported Hitachi Metals, which gained Y20 at Y1,210. But Sumitomo Metal Mining, which has been rallying on the same theme, lost Y10 at Y988 on profit-taking. In Osaka, the OSE average retreated 343.69 to 23,217.22 in volume of 131.5m shares. Roundup Weakness in bonds around the world depressed most of the equity markets in the region. Bombay and Karachi were closed for public holidays. HONG KONG fell for the second straight day on rising US long bond yields and news that Hongkong and Shanghai Banking was considering a further tightening of its mortgage lending rules. The Hang Seng index ended 140.40, or 1.6 per cent, lower at 8,857.78 in thin turnover of HKDollars 2.6bn. The property sector led the losses, its sub-index dropping 2.4 per cent. Cheung Kong shed 50 cents to HKDollars 34.75 and Sun Hung Kai Properties HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 46. HSBC Holdings finished the day unchanged at HKDollars 85. SYDNEY fell through the 2,000 level to end with the All Ordinaries index 30.8 lower at 1,993.6. Brokers blamed the dramatic drop on the bond market, amid inflationary fears. Commonwealth bonds moved down to their lowest levels in 27 months yesterday. The September 2004 T-bond was yielding 9.81 per cent late in the afternoon, up from 9.61 per cent previously. Equity turnover amounted to ADollars 664m. Bridge Oil topped the activity charts with 13.37m shares changing hands. The takeover target closed steady at 85 cents. SINGAPORE and KUALA LUMPUR reflected overnight falls in US and European markets. The Straits Times Industrial index relinquished 22.63 to 2,261.87 and the KLSE composite index slid 24.00, or 2.3 per cent, to 1,011.46. In Singapore, a trader said speculators sold out. In Kuala Lumpur, dealers said some institutions were trimming their portfolios to avoid over-exposure. TAIPEI dropped below the 6,000 support level on a weak financial sector and bearish international markets, the weighted index losing 89.44, or 1.5 per cent, at 5,948.97. Turnover shrank from TDollars 57.7bn to TDollars 46.7bn. In financials, which led last week's gains and were hit by heavy profit-taking, China Trust shed TDollars 2 to TDollars 65.50. MANILA bemoaned Philippine Long Distance Telephone's weakness in New York as the composite index receded 40.09 to 2,814.59. Turnover rose from 507.2m to 895.4m pesos. PLDT, the market heavyweight, following a Dollars 1 7/8 fall to Dollars 61 5/8 on Wall Street, closed slightly over one per cent lower at 1,675 pesos. BANGKOK added domestic politics to more general concerns, worries about rifts in the ruling coalition helping the SET index fall 23.96, or 1.8 per cent, to 1,329.32. COLOMBO bucked the trend, its all-share index making its first double-digit gain in five weeks to close 18.34 higher at 927.76, but brokers said the rise was not sustainable.</p>

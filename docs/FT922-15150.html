			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / German challenge to Farnborough THE GERMAN aerospace industry is challenging Britain by staging in June its first air show in Berlin since the Second World War. It will be only three months before the Farnborough air show at the beginning of September. The challenge reflects Germany's ambitions for its aerospace industry, which has been regrouped around Daimler-Benz, the industrial group. Sir Barry Duxbury, the director of the Society of British Aerospace Companies, the organiser of Farnborough, conceded yesterday that the German move was increasing the competition in the world of air shows. But he said he was confident Farnborough would retain its lead and that the show this year would be a success in spite of the recession, the decline in the airline industry and the cuts in the defence industry. Farnborough and Paris are the leading international air shows and alternate every other year. The society and its French equivalent are determined to maintain the current standing of their respective shows.</p>

			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Observer: Yes and no It is hard to believe that the poor old NatWest bosses involved in the Blue Arrow affair were the only bankers who had trouble understanding what a bank supervisor is saying, let alone thinking. Fortunately, help is at hand. The Old Lady, the house magazine of the Bank of England, has a few tips on how to get the most out of a conversation with a bank supervisor. Rule number one: a banking supervisor never says yes. Rather, he 'has no objection' to a particular suggestion - or, alternatively, he 'takes comfort' from what is proposed. It is also important to realise that a banking supervisor never says no. He simply confines himself to expressing the fact that he is uncomfortable.</p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Major seeks to calm Tory nerves MR JOHN MAJOR last night began the painful process of rebuilding his political authority by promising to deliver sustained economic recovery, radical reform of public services and a tough campaign against crime. In a speech to the Scottish Conservative Conference which mingled contrition for past mistakes with a pledge that his government would 'stick to its principles', the prime minister acknowledged openly the scale of last week's election defeats. After a week that has seen two significant government U-turns, he admitted that a small 18-seat majority in the House of Commons would force the government into occasional climbdowns: 'We may have to tack a little here, manoeuvre a little there. That's politics.' In an attempt to calm the panic in Tory ranks which has raised questions over his leadership, he said his supporters should not 'over-react'. The government still had four years to 'take through our programme of modernising Britain'. As cabinet colleagues talked of drawing a line under the county council and Newbury by-election defeats and the subsequent U-turns over education and unit fines, Mr Major added: 'We Conservatives know all about fightbacks. And today once more we are coming out fighting.' Mr Major made only a passing reference to Mr Norman Lamont, praising the chancellor's 'determination', 'skill' and 'guts'. But he reinforced expectations of a summer cabinet reshuffle by adopting a conspicuously more contrite tone than Mr Lamont about the unemployment, bankruptcies and house repossessions caused by recession. Acknowledging that the government's political future hinged on a durable economic recovery, Mr Major said the government would match its determination to contain inflation with a drive to build a stronger manufacturing base. He told the conference: 'No more boom and no more bust. We are going for steady non-inflationary growth.' In a swipe at the Tory opponents of the Maastricht treaty - it was easy to play John Bull in a china shop - the prime minister insisted that Britain's economic interests were linked inextricably to maintaining its influence in Europe. Instead of 'principled opposition' to Europe, he wanted to 'hear more in the future about principled support for Europe'. Mr Major said that, alongside economic recovery, improvements in public services, the widening of individual choice, providing the 'best education possible' in schools and a new war against crime would dominate the government's agenda. Alison Smith writes: Earlier, Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, attacked Mr Major's administration as the weakest and most incompetent government in living memory. 'They simply lurch from one catastrophe to the next, leaving chaos and dismay in their wake,' he told the Fire Brigades Union at Bridlington. 'Public tolerance of the government is ebbing with the speed of a rip-tide.' Block vote deadline, Page 6 Knives out for Lamont, Page 7 Class action victim, Page 9</p>

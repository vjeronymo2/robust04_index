			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Israeli investment company plans global offering Africa Israel Investments, a leading Israeli investment company with interests in insurance, property and hotels, is planning a Dollars 150m - Dollars 200m global offering in New York, London and Frankfurt early next year. The international offering will follow an Israel secondary offering through the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange worth up to Shk233m (Dollars 77m) which closed yesterday afternoon. Africa Israel will be the first Israeli company outside the high technology and medical sectors to issue shares abroad and together the offerings will raise the largest amount of money in Israel's history. The move marks the growing interest of Israeli companies in raising money on European capital markets and the growing interest of European investors in the Israeli corporate scene. Traditionally, Israeli companies have turned to New York to raise money. Mr Shlomo Grofman, managing director, is optimistic about the local offering, in spite of the weakness of the Tel Aviv exchange, and believes Europe is now a place for Israeli companies to raise money. 'Definitely there is a new environment in Europe since Israel signed peace treaties with Jordan and the Palestinians,' he said. 'European investors are looking at the new Middle East, and particularly companies like ours which reflect the business of the new region.' Morgan Stanley has been appointed global co-ordinator for the international offering and Barclays de Zoete Wedd will be joint lead manager with Morgan Stanley for the European tranche. Smith Barney and Lehman Brothers will also participate in the offering. 'This is the first major Israeli offering with a designated European tranche and reflects growing interest in Israel by international investors,' said Mr Niel Sebag-Montefiore, BZW corporate finance director. The offerings are intended to dilute the holdings of Bank Leumi, the largest shareholder, from the current 50.2 per cent. Under recent banking legislation Bank Leumi must reduce its stake in the company to 25 per cent by December 1996. Mr Grofman said the two offerings will dilute Bank Leumi's share to about 35 to 38 per cent and will be followed by a further global offering later next year. Africa-Israel owns the Migdal insurance group, Israel's largest insurance company, which controlled 24 per cent of the total insurance market last year. The company also controls and manages Holiday Inn, the largest international hotel chain in the country, and has extensive property development schemes under way. Africa Israel boosted first-half net profits by 51 per cent from Shk20m to Shk31.2m. Last year, the company made a net profit of Shk63.2m. The company recently purchased a 26 per cent stake worth Dollars 12.5m in Ayalon, an Israeli petroleum retailer, and a 45 per cent stake in Haifa Quarries is a deal aimed at developing a 15,000 sq m site into a Dollars 25m commercial, office and tourism centre. Chase Manhattan and Bank Leumi le-Israel BM this week announced a strategic alliance designed to provide ADR and GDR programmes 'programme services' to Israeli companies.</p>

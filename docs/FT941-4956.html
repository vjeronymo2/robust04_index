			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / From sop to soap-opera success: The S4C channel's rise to Oscar contender In its early days so few people watched S4C, the Welsh fourth channel, the joke was that it would have been been cheaper to give Welsh speakers free video recorders. More than a decade later all that has changed. The television channel that was seen as a political sop to the Welsh nationalists has not only found an audience and helped to stimulate a television and film production industry, but even has a seat at the Oscars ceremony in Los Angeles later this month. The Welsh-language film Hedd Wyn, the story of a poet from Trawsfynydd and his death in the trenches during the first world war, is one of five nominations for the foreign film Oscar. S4C commissioned and paid for the Pounds 700,000 film, which has already won a Royal Television Society award for best UK drama. 'I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I may go out with an Oscar,' says Mr Geraint Stanley Jones, who retires at the end of next month after five years running the channel. 'What it means is that finally there's a recognition that small could be quite good actually and that a funny language may not be that restrictive,' says the S4C chief executive who was formerly the BBC's first managing director of regional programmes. Recently S4C has migrated from Wales to BBC 2 with its Welsh language soap opera Pobol Y Cwm - People of the Valleys. The popular drama, complete with English sub-titles, has been getting afternoon audiences of about 600,000. With the original S4C viewing attracting audiences of about 250,000, 1m viewers for Pobol Y Cwm might be possible in future. The channel broadcasts 32 hours a week in Welsh, although a growing percentage of Welsh-language programmes carry English sub-titles. The rest of the time S4C reschedules popular Channel 4 programmes such as Brookside and The Big Breakfast. Placing more emphasis on drama and English sub-titles has resulted in increased ratings. In November 1988 the top 10 Welsh-language programmes averaged 74,700 viewers each. By November 1992 this figure had risen to 125,600 and by last November to 202,700. S4C is now funded by a 3.2 per cent share of non-satellite advertising revenue - which includes income from the breakfast franchise and Channel 4 - paid in the form of a block grant from the Treasury via the Department of National Heritage. Last year this accounted for Pounds 55.7m. The channel is also free to sell its own advertising and is expected to raise Pounds 6m this year. It also expects Pounds 10m in co-production money - S4C has made programmes with broadcasters as diverse as ZDF of Germany, ABC of Australia and Fujisanki of Japan, with a particular emphasis on animation. The animated tales of Shakespeare sold to 50 countries and the station is working on a multi-million pound animation of the Old Testament with Christmas Films of Moscow. As Mr Stanley Jones hands over to the new chief executive Mr Huw Jones, a leading Welsh independent producer, it seems a very reasonable legacy for a channel born after Mr Gwynfor Evans, president of Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, threatened to go on hunger strike if one was not created.</p>

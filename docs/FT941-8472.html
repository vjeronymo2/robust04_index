			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / UK Company News: HSBC selling Italian holding HSBC Holdings is selling its 56.6 per cent stake in Euromobiliare, the Italian investment bank, to Credito Emiliano. HSBC said it had agreed in principle to sell the stake, which it acquired through the takeover of Midland Bank in 1992, for about L56bn (Pounds 22.6m). It added that negotiations were continuing, and no date for a transfer had been set. Euromobiliare did not fit with its broader investment banking business, HSBC said. Euromobiliare has capital markets and treasury operations, as well as asset management, but is concentrated in domestic Italian business. Euromobiliare shares slipped from a trading level of L2,965 after HSBC disclosed that it had agreed with Credito Emiliano a price of L2,800 per ordinary share, and L1,830 per non-convertible preference share.</p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / City slams 'low-calibre' non-executive directors The City believes non-executive directors are failing to ensure that high standards of corporate governance are met, a survey for BDO Binder Hamlyn, the accountants, shows today. Institutions suggested that the main reason non-executive directors were not effective was that they were not of a high enough calibre. Non-executive directors themselves said that the main inhibitor to their effectiveness was a dominant chairman or chief executive. Other factors were their insufficient knowledge of the business and the lack of time they could spend on directorships. Mr Clive Reay, a partner in BDO Binder Hamlyn, said yesterday: 'Since many non-executives admit that they spend too little time on their directorships and have insufficient underlying knowledge of the business, it is not surprising that they find a dominant chairman or chief executive a significant inhibiting factor.' The survey, by City Research Associates, had more than 400 respondents. It was generally agreed that the most suitable background for a non-executive director was a top-level management position in another company. Less than a quarter of those questioned rated merchant banking, accountancy or law as suitable backgrounds, while civil service and governmental backgrounds were regarded as suitable by only one in 10. Most respondents agreed that the Cadbury code of conduct had made or would make a significant contribution to the effectiveness of non-executives. However, non-executives rejected the idea that sanctions should be applied against directors who failed to comply with the code. Non-executive Directors - Watchdogs or Advisers?

The governmental organization is made up of 25 countries.  Joining Argentina as a newcomer will be Hungary.    The decision is seen to be the result of a long-term policy  of Foreign Minister Guido di Tella to join the international  committee and was helped by President Menem's decision earlier  this year to scrap the Condor missile development.    In Switzerland yesterday, where the MTCR was due to stage a  meeting, the Argentine representative Andres Cisneros said  Menem's government "had renounced the development of offensive  arms in order to participate in the highest of technological  progress for peaceful ends."</p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Brierley considers move on Brown Shipley GPG, the UK investment vehicle for Sir Ron Brierley, the New Zealand entrepreneur, was last night considering launching a full bid for Brown Shipley Holdings, the investment and broking group. Yesterday it increased its stake in BSH to more than 22 per cent, raising the prospect of a counter-bid to that from BSH's largest shareholder, Kredietbank Luxembourgeoise. KBL holds 29.8 per cent and last year bought Brown Shipley &amp; Co, the merchant bank, from BSH in a rescue deal. KBL is offering 30p a share, valuing BSH at Pounds 4.8m. GPG has paid 35p a share for the latest 14.8 per cent tranche, which it bought from Mr Giorgio Rossi. BSH last night said GPG would have to offer not less than 35p in cash. Mr Rossi resigned from the board of BSH before the KBL bid was announced. He bought shares and joined the board in 1986, when the share price ranged between 400p and 645p. That was also the year KBL took a 20 per cent stake, for which it paid Pounds 23m. Mr Rossi, a former Credito Italiano banker who lives in Switzerland, was once a director and had a 6 per cent stake in Guinness Peat, the forerunner of GPG which was relisted in November after nearly two years' suspension. Mr Rossi sold his Guinness Peat stake in 1983. Yesterday his son Francesco, who works at BSH as a member of the supervisory board, said no connection remained between his father and GPG. He added that his father had sold his BSH stake simply because: '35p is more than 30p. We are very sad to have to take this step. We thought BSH had a future as an independent company.' The first closing date on Thurdsay for KBL's offer, which is recommended by the BSH board, comes after a convoluted series of events. It made the offer in the wake of its claims against BSH totalling Pounds 2.4m. These arose from the acquisition of Brown Shipley and Co and its liabilities after the sale of Lease Management Services to Woodchester Investments, the Dublin-based leasing and banking group. More than Pounds 1.5m has already been paid to Woodchester out of a total liability of Pounds 5m.</p>

Sam Rangsi, in an interview with the  CAMBODIA TIMES, said: "Contrary to common belief, it was not I  who had initiated and implemented this system. It was already  in place during the rule of the former State of Cambodia  government. During that period, French experts had been based  with the then government for almost three years to help them  prepare the fundamentals of the French accounting system. It is  not an entirely new system as many believe. The French  accounting system to be implemented here is based on that  devised in 1982, which is in conformity with many European  accounting systems." [passage omitted]    "The 1982 version is in uniformity with the accounting  systems practised in Britain, Germany and Holland. It is just  the presentation styles that are different. For example, in the  British system, the cash balance is shown at the top of the  accounting figures, while the fixed assets are at the bottom.  In the French system, it is just the reverse. So there is no  great difficulty in adapting or adopting this system," he  pointed out.    Several businessmen had criticised the adoption of the  French  accounting system as a disincentive to much needed foreign  investment and an unnecessary administrative burden for the  local companies. [passage omitted] The main difference between  the French and Anglo-International system is the way assets and  liabilities are classified and how depreciation is treated.</p>

			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / The Markets: All together now for 1995 - Global Investor Will 1995 be the first strong year of global growth since the 1980s? Investment analysts who have written off the prospects for 1994 - continental Europe still stagnant, Japan still deflating, US and UK throttled back by tax rises - are starting to console themselves with the thought of the year after. 'Most of us have forgotten what synchronous global growth is like,' writes Maureen Allyn of Scudder, the US fund managers. Amnesia is particularly common on the subject of commodity prices, partly because, as the chart shows, the uptick of developed country growth in early 1992 was accompanied by largely stable prices for industrial raw materials. However, just because commodity prices fell consistently between the summer of 1988 and the autumn of 1993 is no guarantee that they will stay down. Indeed, the pickup in raw materials prices in the fourth quarter of 1993 is one of the more unremarked developments of recent months. Commodity prices are only one of the elements in global inflation, of course, and the rupture of the wage/price spiral in many countries means that even if there is a sharp rise in the cost of raw materials, it need not feed so rapidly into the general price level. One other comfort is often cited, the downward pressure on prices stemming from the shift of manufacturing output to the Pacific Rim. This is 'just plain wrong', argues Albert Edwards of Kleinwort Benson in London. In low-wage economies raw materials account for a far higher proportion of costs than in mature, high-wage economies. 'Thus if commodity prices start rising,' he says, 'low-wage producers will be forced to pass on these increases far more quickly.' A strong year worldwide in 1995 might pose some inflationary risks. For big international companies, however, it would be the first year since 1989 when results were not damaged by recession somewhere in the developed world. If that thought becomes widespread, it would do something to justify the level at which stock markets are selling. Germanic The Germanisation of the UK money markets comes a step closer on Thursday when the Bank of England announces the terms of its first extended repo facility, allowing the Bank to supply funds to the money market on a more settled, longer-term basis than its current day-to-day activities. It will make its operating practices look a little more like those of the Bundesbank. Whether the Bank starts to innovate more rapidly will partly depend on how seriously it takes the recommendations of papers for the City Research Project written by Norbert Schnadt of the Financial Markets Group at the London School of Economics. Mr Schnadt argues that London's attractiveness as a financial centre is hampered by the volatility of short-term interest rates, which in turn stems from the Bank's traditional operating practices. These are influenced by the Bank's historic rivalry with the clearing banks. It is more than a century since the Bank stopped lending in competition with the clearers, but it is still left with the folk memory of the preceding 200 years. Nonetheless, in its tercentenary year, there are signs that the Bank is throwing off this legacy of the past. The new repo system is the logical extension of the post-1987 changes to the money market which deprived the discount houses of their unique access to the central bank and brought it, at last, into direct bilateral dealings with the clearers. Now, the Bank is undergoing a period of intense introspection as it redraws its internal organisation to support its three core aims: monetary stability, systemic stability, and the attractiveness of the UK as a financial centre. Its response to Mr Schnadt's recommendations for a further extension of the repo system will indicate just how much weight it places on the third of its priorities. Re-integration The death of vertical integration, discussed in this space last week, has started to generate its own contrarian antithesis. Boston Consulting Group has just published a note proclaiming a rebirth of vertical integration, not in the wholly-owned form of the past, but as a partnership linking the entire supply chain into an integrated customer-focused system. 'One such group,' says BCG, 'is Du Pont (fibres), Spring Mills (fabric), Warren Featherstone (children's apparel) and Mercantile stores. 'They first got together to defend themselves against imported clothing and began by sharing point of sale information. Later they started to co-operate in planning product-line introductions. The result has been spectacular. Markdowns are a third of the industry average, gross profit margins rose throughout the past recession, and share of market has increased.' From an investment point of view, the new co-operators are as attractive as the companies profiting from dis-integrating. Just harder to spot. Bloodletting The first anniversary is upon us of a remarkable week of corporate bloodletting in the US. A few days in late January 1993 saw John Akers resign at IBM, Paul Lego leave at Westinghouse, and James Robinson take the first step towards the door at American Express. The US results season, just getting under way, will give investors their first considered opportunity to pass judgment on the performance of the departing bosses' successors. In advance of this opportunity, reaction has been mixed. Westinghouse, for example, has consistently underperformed the US market since the change of management. American Express initially outperformed but has drifted downwards in relative terms since last autumn. IBM, the most spectacular case of a company in trouble, initially did comparatively poorly but has outperformed since December. Nonetheless, a year after IBM cut its dividend its shares are selling for less than they did two decades ago. Analysts are starting to say it is time to re-assess IBM's prospects. Good results could turn favourable opinions into some solid buying. There are still just as many pros as there are cons, however. On the plus side is Louis Gerstner's decision, a few months after taking over as chairman, to undo the radical decentralisation planned by John Akers. IBM is a global, full-line computer company or it is nothing. Splitting the company up as Akers planned would have destroyed this precious asset. Other pluses include the much tighter focus on costs, the move towards a new unifying technology (the chips designed for the PowerPC, which may eventually unite all IBM's range), and the determination to exploit IBM's greatest single advantage, the installed base of existing computers, by listening more closely to customers' complaints. Against that there is the vulnerability of the mainframe business, on which IBM's profitability still depends; the history of slow development, with promising innovations delayed by internal competition and the worldwide duplication of bureaucracies and facilities. Tackling this last weakness will mean, in 1994, the sort of cuts in Europe which have already affected IBM's US operations, which will weaken IBM's hold on its European customers and its ability to present itself as the model corporate citizen. Conclusion: IBM's long-term prosperity is not assured, but in the short run investors may take the opportunity of any favourable earnings news to re-assess the company's shares. Slightly further out, much hangs on Europe, where the computer-downsizing trend is not yet as well-established as in the US. As Europe starts to recover from recession, IBM will be hoping for a few more lucrative mainframe years there. That might be the breathing space Mr Gerstner needs.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              TOTAL RETURN IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 13/1/94  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                    % change over period                     US     Japan     Germany     France     Italy    UK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week              0.06     0.05       0.12        0.13      0.16   0.10 Month             0.28     0.20       0.53        0.56      0.72   0.47 Year              3.81     3.47       7.44        9.50     12.44   6.66  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week              0.57    -0.45      -0.09        0.18      0.19  -0.09 Month             0.92    -0.12       0.52        1.15      1.64  -0.14 Year              9.09    10.55      12.53       17.50     27.41  12.88  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week              1.06    -0.11       0.05        0.56      0.13  -0.35 Month             1.28     0.69       1.06        1.63      2.12   0.39 Year             13.64    14.89      16.45       23.48     39.15  20.26  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week               1.2      1.9       -2.6        -0.3      -0.3   -0.9 Month              1.6      2.2       -0.7         4.3       0.5   4.4 Year              11.6     19.5       43.7        36.2      39.5   29.3  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            Best performing stocks from FT-A World Indices                      in local currency to  13/1/94  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                            % change                                Close       Week      Month     Year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Playmates Property      3.10 HKDollars     50.8       67.4     77.2 Hanwa                            730 Y     40.4      -16.2    -47.9 Nippon Paint                     655 Y     24.8       29.4     33.4 Sakanska                      226.0 SK     22.8       34.5    182.5 Tattinger                     2,910 FF     20.5       38.6     35.3 CEPSA                         2,910 Pt     20.0       15.0      7.4 Aalborg Portland                650 Kr     19.2       12.4     63.9 Misawa Homes                   1,000 Y     19.0      -10.7      0.3 Crean, James             315.0 EPounds     18.9       10.5     13.7 First National Finance            72.5     18.9       22.9     24.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cash &amp; Bonds - Lehman Brothers.

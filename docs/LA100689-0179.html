			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> FASTER DISASTER RELIEF EMPHASIZED  </P> <P> Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said today that he hopes federal disaster officials  react faster to the next national disaster than they did in the aftermath of  Hurricane Hugo.  </P> <P> Riley said he met with top Federal Emergency Management Agency officials and  found them sincere, but called the disaster relief law "grossly inadequate" and  the response to the emergency too slow.  </P> <P> "I hope next time a national disaster hits this country, the government will  have a better response," Riley said. "I would be shirking my responsiblity and  be less honest if I didn't say what I felt."  </P> <P> "When the rubble is clear, we will work with Congress for a better law and a  better response," the mayor said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Douglas Hurd, British secretary of state for  foreign and Commonwealth affairs, has declared that the  confidence-building measures [CBM] package submitted by the  United Nations on the Cyprus issue is not dead. U.S. Secretary  of State Warren Christopher also declared: I hope that the  CBM's are not really dead.    Hurd and Christopher expressed their views on the subject in  Istanbul, where they are currently attending NATO meetings, in  response to reporters' questions regarding Greek Foreign  Minister Karolos Papoulias' statement that the CBM's are dead as  far as Greece and the Greek Cypriot side are concerned. Hurd  said that he does not share the views of Papoulias, who  described the package as dead, adding: Efforts are continuing  in order to reach an agreement. Comprehensive progress has been  achieved. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (18): And finally . . . the one that got away - Teesside's 'buns not guns' controversy IT WILL go down as one of the oddest relocation tussles ever. Stockton-on-Tees, promised 1,600 Ministry of Defence Quality Assurance Unit jobs, many of them high quality technical and scientific posts, ended up instead with a consolation prize - a cheesecake factory. The 'buns not guns' controversy which erupted earlier this year generated bad feeling which extended beyond Teesside. The row did nothing to sweeten relations between Labour-controlled Cleveland County Council and Stockton South's Conservative MP, Mr Tim Devlin, since re-elected with a substantially increased majority. But it is still unclear whether, in the end, Stockton would have been better off with its lost MoD project or the promised substitutes. The saga began in early 1989 when the government announced that, as part of its policy of relocating staff away from the south east, its 1,500-job Quality Assurance Unit headquarters and laboratories would move from Woolwich and Bromley to Preston Farm, a 90-acre industrial site in Stockton, in Cleveland, north east England. It subsequently said four smaller MoD labs, scattered throughout Britain and employing 100 in total, would also move. News of the Pounds 100m relocation was warmly welcomed in Teesside, a high unemployment area still smarting at the scrapping in 1979 of the Property Services Agency's proposed move to Middlesbrough. The local authorities saw the MoD relocation as a way of widening Teesside's economic base. But in 1990 it became clear the government was having second thoughts due to increased cost estimates and 'peace dividend' defence spending cuts. The government-funded Teesside Development Corporation has planning and marketing powers over the Preston Farm site, formerly occupied by engineers Whessoe, and now cleared for new industry. As uncertainty over the MoD relocation dragged on, the TDC lobbied discreetly while the local authorities appealed to Margaret Thatcher and John Major, dispatched delegations to London and sent a Why It Must Be Stockton leaflet to hundreds of MPs and civil servants. This, said Cleveland County Council, was a 'battle of principle' for the whole of the North. Teesside's biggest employer, ICI, also became involved, offering facilities in the area if Preston Farm no longer suited the MoD. Teesside wanted the project but, as prospects dimmed, its front was far from united. A bad-tempered rift developed between Cleveland County Council, which argued the project must be 'saved' for the area, and Mr Devlin, who was much less enthusiastic, maintaining that if the plan were off it would be better Preston Farm were released for other uses. Maybe the government thought it was pouring oil on troubled waters when it announced in February that, whilst the MoD Unit was now to be merged with the Defence Research Agency and dispersed among DRA sites in southern England, Preston Farm was to have a Pounds 7m cheesecake and gateau factory, creating 700 jobs. "Absolutely brilliant,' insisted Mr Devlin, then sitting on a slender 774 majority in a three-way marginal seat. 'About one third of these jobs will be leading edge technology jobs.' He forecast that incoming projects on other parts of the site meant that it would probably end up with more jobs than the MoD had offered. Cleveland county council was unimpressed - 'no way can you compare 700 jobs at a cake factory with the sort of high quality, technical scientific and training opportunities which the MoD would have brought,' insisted a spokesman. The cake factory project, it transpired, was the brainchild of a flamboyant and controversial Cypriot entrepreneur 'Mr Chris' Liveras. In 1982, Mr Chris started a gateau business in Hartlepool, CDL 44 - his initials and age at the time - selling out in 1988 to Allied Lyons and moving back to Cyprus from his Teesside residence, Black Forest Chateau. But after the Stockton project was announced, it emerged it had originally been destined for Peterlee, nine miles north of Hartlepool. Lengthy discussions with County Durham's inward investment agencies had foundered after the Department of Trade and Industry declined a Pounds 1.8m Selective Regional Assistance grant, largely because of fears the new gateau plant might displace jobs at Mr Chris' former Hartlepool factory, still trading under Allied Lyons. Angry Durham Labour politicians talked of 'duplicity and political expediency' - Preston Farm is only three miles further from Hartlepool than Peterlee, but whilst Peterlee is part of the rock-solid Labour Easington constituency Stockton South was a Tory-held marginal. The TDC, funded by the Department of the Environment, not the DTI, declined to reveal how much of the Pounds 7m being invested in the project was public money. But it insisted there was no threat to the Hartlepool plant since the new Livera Foods factory at Preston Farm will be supplying a national and international market. It also said restrictions placed on new projects by Mr Chris when he sold to Allied Lyons had elapsed by the time his scheme reached Stockton. Mr Chris, buoyed up by turning swords into cheesecake, boldly forecast he would produce up to 75m gateaux annually from his new plant. Cleveland County Council, meanwhile, called for a thorough parliamentary investigation into the cake factory affair. Cleveland, it claimed, had lost not only the MoD jobs but also 1,000 spin-off jobs, plus 2,200 posts in another potential civil service project deterred from Cleveland by fears of possible MoD competition for labour. Mr Devlin, returned with a 3,369 majority in the general election, claims a further 1,300 jobs are about to be announced for the site, where Mr Chris' project still leave 75 acres available. Mr Devlin is lukewarm about government relocations - 'the north east culture needs to move away from large-scale state investment towards small private sector investment." He is pressing the TDC to reveal details of the new companies he claims are to move onto the site. Cleveland County Council is maintaining a 'we'll believe it when we see it' stance. The TDC, for its part, is trying to please everybody by assembling a big announcement of up to five incoming projects, large and small, at Preston Farm. An announcement is anticipated next month. But a celebratory cake-cutting looks unlikely.</p>

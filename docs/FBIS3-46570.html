			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "They Should Not Act Rashly"] </F>   [Text] As soon as Yi Pyong-tae of South Korea succeeded  Kwon Yong-hae as new puppet National Defense minister, he did  not hesitate in revealing his warmonger's colors.    According to a report, he held a news conference on 28  December and said that the so-called modernization and  science-orientation of the army are an indispensable trend and  he raved that he would press ahead with the Yulgok project in  the future without fail.    As everyone knows, the Yulgok project is the work to  reinforce the puppet army's war capacity. The project has been  promoted by Chongwadae [presidential office] and the National  Defense Ministry since the mid-1970's, with a view to  accelerating preparations for a war of northward invasion.    The puppets have so far expended an enormous 3 billion won  for the Yulgok project, including the full-scale introduction of  modern war equipment from foreign countries and the development  of new weapons. In this process, the people have denounced and  rejected the puppets for their abuse of funds.    The Kim Yong-sam ring revealed its inner intention to  further  accelerate preparations for a northward invasion war, by openly  saying that the Yulgok project will be constantly promoted and  that the modernization and science-orientation of the army are  an indispensable trend. Our nation has clearly remembered the  miserable calamities and unhappiness our fellow countrymen had  to suffer when war broke out approximately 40 years ago. Thus  our nation unanimously hopes for the absence of war on the  Korean peninsula and the establishment of peace.    To ensure peace on the Korean peninsula, the North and the  South should not conduct an arms race, but realize disarmament.  Peace is inconceivable apart from disarmament. Because the  North and the South have confirmed the nonaggression that the  North and the South should not use armed forces against each  other and not invade each other with armed forces, the issue of  disarmament arises as an urgent issue that brooks no further  delay. If one side takes the road to reinforce military  expenditures, this will bring the result of aggravating the  North-South confrontation and, thus, the outbreak of war.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet ring, raving that peace can be  maintained by reinforcing strength, has increased the puppet  troops, introduced hundreds of missiles from the United States,  and acquired war equipment on a full scale. The Kim Yong-sam  puppet ring has earmarked over one billion won for next year's  military expenditure, up 9.6 percent over last year's figures.    Reinforcement of armed forces cannot abide by peace. It goes  without saying that a reinforcement of armed forces is  tantamount to preparing for war. Even though the Kim Yong-sam  puppet ring babbles about the superiority of one's fellow  countrymen over the foreign forces, it decided to constantly  promote the Yulgok project which the people reject, by using the  pretext of its so-called civilian- controlled regime. This  clearly shows that the Kim Yong-sam puppet rings are the  military rascals and warmongers of a civilian-controlled regime,  not different from their predecessors that incited fever for the  preparations for war. This also actually proves who really  desires peace and who really schemes war on the Korean peninsula.    What cannot be tolerated is that on 24 December, the  so-called puppet national defense minister ordered the puppet  commanders and staff to be prepared to mobilize at any time and  make full preparations to carry out operations as the year-end  days draw near.    The South Korean puppet army is already alert enough for  mobilization at anytime. The order to get ready for  mobilization anytime is a move to ignite the fuse of a northward  invasion war by further driving the situation to the brink of a  war. This is an unpardonable challenge to the people's desire  for peace reunification.    Peace is still being maintained on the Korean peninsula  where  enormous armed forces confront each other along the Military  Demarcation Line and where the South Korean puppets' war  maneuvers become more vicious. This is the result of our  patient efforts. Even though we value peace, we will never  pardon aggressors provoking us. Reinforcement of armed forces  and aggravation of tension only brings the ruin of the  civilian-controlled regime. The Kim Yong-sam puppet ring should  clearly know nothing will be gained from the adventurous war  maneuvers and should not act recklessly.</p>

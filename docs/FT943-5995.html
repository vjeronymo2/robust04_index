			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Graduate employment surges More than 50,000 new graduates of English higher-education institutions had found permanent employment by the end of last year, the highest figure on record, the Department for Education said yesterday. The figures follow several other surveys which suggest that graduate unemployment has peaked, and that the labour market is now absorbing the extra number of graduates being produced by England's expanded higher-education system. The number of graduates finding a permanent job rose 19 per cent to 51,500, having fallen for three successive years since the previous peak in 1989 of 48,300. Women's success in the graduate labour market improved sharply. For the first time on record, more female graduates (26,500) found jobs than men (25,000). While 41 per cent of female graduates found a permanent job, only 36.9 per cent of male graduates did so. Graduate unemployment stabilised at 13,600, having trebled over the previous three years. Men were far more likely to be without a job six months after graduating, suffering an un-employment rate of 12.25 per cent compared with 8.2 per cent for women. This was achieved in spite of a 120 per cent increase in the number of women graduating since 1983. They accounted for 49.5 per cent of all graduates, up from 43 per cent 10 years earlier. Numbers entering teacher training rose 5 per cent, while entries to other further-education and training courses rose 4 per cent following several years of swift increases. Of those gaining a first degree, 49 per cent obtained a first or upper second class honours award compared with 45 per cent in 1989. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, pointed out that Britain had the highest graduation rate in the EU, and added: 'The quality controls we have set in place for higher education ensure that the standards of degrees are maintained.' The proportion graduating in science rose to 36 per cent compared with 34 per cent in 1989. The proportion of women graduates in science has risen from 21 per cent in 1989 to 24 per cent in 1993.</p>

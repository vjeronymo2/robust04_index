			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Uthman Mirghani: "Al-Mahdi Stresses His </F> Commitment to `Civil Jihad'"]    [Excerpts] London -- The Sudanese opposition Ummah Party  yesterday condemned the arrest by security authorities of its  leader, former Prime Minister al-Sadiq al-Mahdi. The party  described the accusations leveled at him -- namely that he led a  scheme to carry out bombings and assassinations -- as "a  fabricated theatrical ploy within the framework of the continued  harassment of him."    The Ummah Party yesterday distributed a statement which it  said was prepared by al-Mahdi before his arrest, concerning the  arrest by security authorities of two Ummah Party leaders,  namely Professor Hammad Baqadi and 'Abd-al-Rahman Farah.    In his statement al-Mahdi said that the basic principle on  the basis of which he operates is "civil jihad, and working to  achieve democracy in Sudan without bloodshed or foreign  intervention." [passage omitted]    Al-Sadiq al-Mahdi said in the statement distributed by the  Ummah Party yesterday that "security services have on several  occasions tried to fabricate accusations against us: They  accused us once of working with Libya to achieve certain aims  through violence. That was in 1989. Then they leveled  accusations at us on more than three occasions: They twice  accused us of planning coup attempts, and once they dragged our  name into the bombings case heard recently. They also  fabricated numerous accusations against us with regard to cases  involving violence and bloodshed. These accusations are nothing  but fabrications."    Al-Mahdi added: "This is why I say once again that the  present accusations leveled at some well-known men from our  group are nothing but an attempt to distort our reputation and  continue the usual fabrications in a bid to create sensational  situations and divert attention from the political and economic  failures."    Concluding, he said: "Once again I say that we are pursuing  one line, that is civil jihad, to achieve the homeland's aims.  And even if we -- for one reason or another -- decide to pursue  another line, it would not be in such a naive manner or in the  recklessness clear in the background of the accusations."

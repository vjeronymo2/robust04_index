			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / File on Legion cash loss sent to Crown A DOSSIER outlining how the Royal British Legion lost nearly Pounds 900,000 of public money has been sent to the attorney-general. The Charity Commissioners' report follows an inquiry into the collapse of a housing association run by the legion. The report, sent to the attorney-general for information, severely criticised the way the housing association charity was run and delivered a 'severe public rebuke' to officials in office at the time. The legion's national executive council and the finance and general purposes committee authorised Pounds 2.35m to be lent to the housing association, in breach of trust laws. Commissioners claim that the charity was negligent and 'out of its depth' in the course of its dealings with the property market. Mr Ian Davies, the investigator, said it was 'particularly disturbing' to find the legion took no professional advice before making the original loan of Pounds 1.5m. Early warnings that all was not well were given in 1987, yet trustees failed to act on the warnings and get the situation under control, the report said. Two years later difficulties with loans increased, yet 'trustees did not appear to take any notice of this matter, nor institute any inquiry as to what was going wrong and whether they should be taking any further action'. Even when the trustees had realised that they were out of their depth they had failed to act quickly to stem their losses, the report said. The 95-page report, the result of a two-year investigation into the loss, said some of the money which was involved was paid back, but almost Pounds 900,000 had been lost. It claimed that the 'fragmented management structure' of the British Legion contributed to the development of the issue. However, it noted, a 'thoroughgoing review' of the charity's internal structure was now taking place.</p>

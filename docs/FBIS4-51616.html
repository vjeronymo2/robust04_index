			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 2 (YONHAP) -- North Korea is cordoning  off a special economic zone with barbed wire and check points,  apparently isolating the area to prevent contact between  foreigners and locals, official and business sources here said  Monday.    The Stalinist state has sped up production of steel wire and  is ordering more from China and Southeast Asian countries to  encircle the 746-square-kilometer "Najin-Sonbong" zone,  according to the sources.    Pyongyang elevated the zone last year to Najin-Sonbong city  and added more land to enlarge the area from 621 square  kilometers to 746 square kilometers in an ambitious move to  attract foreign companies and investment.    The recent attempt to isolate the zone is another concrete  measure to expedite the process while preventing negative  repercussions that might force an opening of North Korean  society or the introduction of foreign culture, the sources said.    They added that North Korea is busy obtaining all available  barbed wire and has asked for a possible South Korean supply  through third countries.</p>

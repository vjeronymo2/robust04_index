			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> 6 MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS SUE CITY  </P> <P> Six mobile home park owners in Oxnard have filed lawsuits against the city,  claiming that its rent control policies place unfair restrictions on park  owners.  </P> <P> Robert S. Coldren, a Santa Ana attorney representing the park owners, said the  suit filed Wednesday in Ventura County Superior Court will seek "millions of  dollars in damages" and will try to eliminate Oxnard's rent control laws.  </P> <P> Coldren said Oxnard's rent control policy is unfair because it provides tenants  with a perpetual lease while placing limits on the rents charged by park  owners.  </P> <P> The law also allows tenants to take advantage of the low rents by selling the  homes at an inflated price but prohibits park owners from raising rents when a  new tenant moves in, he said.  </P> <P> In essence, the law allows tenants to profit from the low rents but provides no  profits for the park owner, Coldren said.  </P> <P> Coldren said similar lawsuits have been won against the cities of Los Angeles  and Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> City Atty. Gary L. Gillig said the rent control laws in Oxnard are not  identical to those in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> "Yes, it is a matter of concern, but since our laws are different from those  others, what happened in those cities won't necessarily happen here," he said.  </P> <P> Oscar Karrin, a mobile-home activist and candidate for City Council, criticized  the lawsuits, saying park owners already profit a great deal. "Park owners are  making so much money it's not even funny," he said. HUGO MARTIN  </P></p>

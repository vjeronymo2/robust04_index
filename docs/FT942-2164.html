			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Accountants urged to watch liability limits Accountancy firms are being encouraged to limit their liability when producing new-style 'compilation' reports on the accounts of smaller companies, under draft guidelines issued by the Auditing Practices Board yesterday. Proposed guidelines were issued by the board to flesh out regulations issued by the Department of Trade and Industry which are designed to lessen the burden of the annual statutory audit for smaller companies. Yesterday's document says: 'The reporting accountant may wish to agree with the directors a limit on any liability arising out of the work.' One effect may be to restrict the level of scrutiny by accountants in producing the compilation reports, in the knowledge that any settlement following legal action will be limited. The recommendation comes at a time when the larger accountancy firms, backed by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, are lobbying for a limit on their liability when conducting audits. A number of firms are already restricting their exposure in the event of litigation arising from consulting, tax or other work conducted for clients, but they are currently expressly forbidden by section 310 of the 1985 companies act from limiting liability on audits. Mr Michael Foulds, a partner with accountants Foulds &amp; Grant and chairman of the working party which produced the guidelines, said: 'This is not an audit. It is the furthest thing removed from an audit. Firms are entirely free to negotiate limits on non-audit services. Earlier this month the institute warned that reporting accountants examining companies' figures under the new smaller company audit rules might need to carry out additional work because of ambiguities in the requirements for the compilation report and the fact that its application had not been tested in the courts. However, Mr Foulds said the compilation report should require less work than auditors are currently required to carry out on full audits. Under the government's relaxations - due to come into force in August - companies with a turnover of Pounds 90,000 to Pounds 350,000 will be required to have a compilation report in place of a full statutory annual audit.

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Cabinet agrees to cut spending by up to Pounds 5bn: Major wins backing for Clarke's Budget programme Mr John Major yesterday won cabinet backing for a battle plan for controversial European Union legislation and public spending cuts of between Pounds 4bn and Pounds 5bn. As the cabinet put the finishing touches to the spending side of this month's Budget, backbench rightwing rebels dismissed reports that Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, plans to challenge Mr Major for the Tory leadership. In a further embarrassment to the government, it emerged that the powerful Commons trade and industry committee is considering whether to reopen an inquiry into the future of the Post Office. MPs said the committee might call evidence from Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, raising the prospect of damaging revelations about the cabinet's decision to bow to pressure from a handful of backbench opponents of privatisation. Mr Bill Cockburn, the Post Office chief executive, last night met Mr Heseltine to demand rapid progress towards greater commercial freedom. Mr Cockburn, accompanied by Mr Mike Heron, chairman, is understood to have sought a reduction of Pounds 100m in the annual Post Office levy to the government, to pay for investment in more competitive equipment. Details of the spending programme put forward by Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, were tied up after ministers accepted compromise proposals from Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, for cuts to the Pounds 8bn housing benefit budget. Ministers also agreed the outstanding details of plans for a limited disablement rights bill, designed to mollify those outraged by the government's opposition earlier this year to a more comprehensive backbench bill. Most of the hour-long cabinet meeting was taken up with a debate on the forthcoming bill to increase British contributions to the EU, which is bitterly opposed by Tory Euro-sceptics. Mr Major warned the cabinet that all EU governments are committed to implementing the increase in contributions by early next year. He urged ministers to make clear to rightwing critics that the cost is estimated at only Pounds 75m next year, and a maximum of Pounds 250m by 2000. The prime minister also told ministers to make sure backbenchers understand that the bill would lock in arrangements for British rebates from the EU budget until the end of the century. In a sign of his confidence that the rebels can be talked into backing down, Mr Major cancelled a meeting today at which he planned to work out a strategy for the bill with business managers and top cabinet allies. Rightwingers continued to threaten the bill, however. Mr Tony Marlow, MP for Northampton North, said he would fight it 'tooth and nail'. But Mr John Townend, MP for Bridlington, dismissed reports of a plot to unseat Mr Major. 'It's a load of rubbish. There is no plot. I've got my ear pretty close to the ground and I don't know about any challenge.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Excerpt] The latest reports from Ghana's troubled Northern  Region put the death toll at over 500 after weeks of communal  clashes between the Komkomba and Nanumba ethnic groups. A state  of emergency has been imposed as well as a dusk to dawn curfew  and thousands of Komkombas have fled across the border into  Togo. In the last week, several senior figures have visited the  region, and last Tuesday [8 February], 18 MP's from the area  issued a statement accusing some Komkombas of being the  aggressors and of committing atrocities. One of those MP's is  the deputy speaker of Parliament, Mohamed Ibn Chambas. On the  line to Accra, Ajoa Yeboah-Afari asked him what he had found  when he visited the north.    [Begin recording] [Chambas] It was a major disaster. I mean,  I traveled from Yendi to Bimbila. Virtually every major town  along that road had been burned down. Dead bodies littered the  entire road from Bimbila to Yendi.    [Yeboah-Afari] How many people would you say died in the  conflict or have died so far?    [Chambas] Frankly, I cannot tell at this point.    [Yeboah-Afari] Would you put it in the hundreds or  thousands?  Some people have said thousands have died.    [Chambas] I would say in the hundreds, for now.    [Yeboah-Afari] What about the extent of destruction?    [Chambas] Homes have been destroyed, you know. Then,  infrastructure, I mean, schools, small-scale businesses like  grinding mills and shops have all been looted and burned. So,  it is quite extensive damage economically also.    [Yeboah-Afari] So, who would you blame for this destruction?  I believe the statement that you made in Parliament blamed the  Komkombas.    [Chambas] It is probably not the time to, you know, point  accusing fingers. The security forces are on the ground and  they can identify the source of problems.    [Yeboah-Afari] But your statement did specifically say the  Komkombas were believed to be the people causing the problem?    [Chambas] Well, what I talked about in that statement was  what I saw. I mean, I witnessed two towns -- major towns -- on  the Yendi-Bimbila road being burned down by one particular  group. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

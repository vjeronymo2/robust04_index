			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PRIDE CARRIES VALLEY BUT NOT FAR ENOUGH, 20-17  </P> <P> Down to its last game and with no bowl to call its own, Valley College lined up  against Santa Monica on Saturday and played for pride.  </P> <P> And until Cuneyt Karacuha's 38-yard field-goal attempt sailed just wide left  late in the fourth period, it looked like Valley might have something to be  proud of.  </P> <P> But in the end, host Valley's 20-17 Western State Conference loss to bowl-bound  Santa Monica was just another frustrating Saturday in a season filled with  them.  </P> <P> "It's kind of upsetting. That field goal missed by about an inch from tying the  score," Valley quarterback Mark Mengoni said. "I was glad we could stay close  to them, but we should have beat them."  </P> <P> Valley (3-7 overall, 3-6 in conference play) battled back from 7-0 and 14-7  deficits to tie the score, 14-14, on Mengoni's 58-yard touchdown pass to Cliff  Robinson and Karacuha's conversion kick late in the second period. The Monarchs  took the lead on Karacuha's 36-yard third-quarter field goal and stopped Santa  Monica on three consecutive possessions before Jeff Barrett engineered the  game-winning drive.  </P> <P> Barrett completed a 63-yard pass to Jason Lucky to put the ball at the Valley  18, and four plays later Barrett scored on a nine-yard keeper. Chris Jackson's  kick was wide, but Santa Monica (8-2, 7-2) led, 20-17, with 9 minutes 9 seconds  to play.  </P> <P> Valley drove 31 yards in 11 plays to set up Karacuha's potential game-tying  kick, but the ball sailed wide with 3:19 left.  </P> <P> Barrett, who completed eight of 28 for 228 yards and threw two interceptions,  had a hand in all three Corsair touchdowns, scoring on a one-yard  second-quarter sneak and tossing an 80-yard touchdown pass to Turhon O'Bannon  on Santa Monica's first play from scrimmage.  </P> <P> Mengoni, who entered the game in the first period after starter Trendell  Williams reaggravated a season-long rotator cuff injury, completed 10 of 20 for  141 yards with one interception.  </P></p>

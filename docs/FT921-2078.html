			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Auction houses' results hint at upturn THERE are signs that the international art market is over the worst of the global recession. Sotheby's announced yesterday that it made a profit last year in spite a drop in auction sales to Dollars 1.1bn against Dollars 2.4bn in 1990. On Monday its rival Christie's also announced a small profit. Profit for both auction houses was much lower than in 1990, but there had been fears that both auction houses would report a loss. A succession of cost-cutting exercises - linked to a reluctance to accept for sale works of art of doubtful quality - kept the salerooms in the black.  Staff levels have been cut, marketing and catalogue expenses reduced and salaries frozen. Both auction houses have concentrated on the decorative arts - furniture, silver, ceramics - which appeal to a connoisseur market, rather than paintings, especially Impressionist and 20th century paintings, which attracted speculative buying and precipitated a price collapse in the autumn of 1990. Mr Michael Ainslie, president of Sotheby's, said yesterday: 'Decorative art made up approximately 56 per cent of our overall sales total in 1991 compared to 38 per cent and 30 per cent in 1990 and 1989 respectively.' Auctions in 1992 have so far proved reassuring, he said. 'We are 12 per cent up on 1991.' The one sector where little substantial improvement is expected is Impressionist and Modern art which in 1990 accounted for about half of Sotheby's turnover. To boost turnover, the auction houses are courting owners of good Old Master paintings, the only antiques which can approach the Impressionists in value. Christie's hopes to sell masterpieces by Holbein, Rembrandt and Canaletto on April 15 (although it is possible that the Holbein will be saved for the nation before the auction), while Sotheby's has announced that it was will offer a Rembrandt owned by Lord Rosebery on July 8. A timely indication of better days came yesterday in London where Sotheby's sold an ivory netsuke (the toggle used to hold together kimonos) for Pounds 77,000. In 1968 the same netsuke made Pounds 300. On Wednesday Christie's auctioned a gold lacquer screen for Pounds 220,000. Sotheby's results, Page 22</p>

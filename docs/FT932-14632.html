			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Senior bourses mark time ahead of Buba meeting SENIOR bourses continued to mark time yesterday, waiting for next week's Bundesbank meeting in the hope of more interest rate cuts, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT ended the week 1.4 per cent ahead, with the DAX index up 3.64 to 1,678.85 in turnover down from DM5.6bn to DM4.8bn. Volkswagen rose DM6.40 to DM317.70. Dealers liked the fact that the VW brand name sold 5.2 per cent more cars in March than it did in the same month of 1991. Mannesmann rose DM3.50 to DM260.50 as it confirmed a DM1.1bn financing arrangement for its D2 mobile telephone network; Veba climbed DM4.50 to DM388 on expansion plans at its PreussenElektra power generation unit, and following a recent Merck Finck buy recommendation which looked for better things from its cyclical chemicals and oils divisions. BRUSSELS turned its attention from Petrofina, active this week on unfounded speculation that Elf Aquitaine might be building on its 5 per cent stake, to Solvay. Reports that a number of brokers had reduced their 1993 eps forecasts and issued sell notes left Solvay BFr300 or 1.8 per cent lower at BFr12,500, after an intraday low of BFr12,350. Petrofina suffered some profit-taking as it closed BFr50 lower at BFr9,350, still 4 per cent better since Tuesday. The Bel-20 index shed 4.86 to 1,254.07, barely changed on the week, in turnover of BFr1.45bn. MILAN picked up, taking its lead from strong demand for telecoms and helped by end of account book squaring. The Comit index rose 4.94 to 513.26, little changed on the week. Telecoms climbed on proposals to change tariff. Stet, the state holding company, rose L122 or 5.2 per cent to fix at L2,450 while Sip, the main telephone utility, added L70 or 3.9 per cent to L1,829. Strong foreign buying was reported. ZURICH edged marginally higher ahead of a holiday weekend. A firmer trend in the dollar helped exporters late in the session and the SMI index rose 2.0 to 2,162.9, 1.1 per cent lower on the week. Sulzer, the engineering group, rose SFr29 or 4 per cent to SFr755 ahead of next week's annual news conference which is expected to unveil a bright outlook for the company. Alusuisse dipped SFr9 to SFr485 in response to Thursday's late announcement of a one-for-10 rights issue. MADRID moved up gently again, the general index closing 0.75 higher at 239.83 for a 2 per cent gain on the week on the conviction that interest rates are coming down. PARIS drifted into the weekend with the CAC-40 down 1.94 to 1,986.69 and unchanged on the week. Turnover slipped to FFr2.1bn. Total continued to attract buyers but the shares only nudged up 80 centimes to FFr272, while Elf Aquitaine, which denied that it might be lifting its stake in Petrofina, rose FFr2.60 to FFr371.50. Eurotunnel, which is expected to release results on Monday, lost 25 centimes to FFr38.85. VIENNA saw an operating loss and a passed dividend take Austrian Airlines Sch45 or 3 per cent lower at Sch1,485. The ATX index fell 9.81 to 765.46, off 2.3 per cent on the week. AMSTERDAM was supported by options expiry as the CBS Tendency index rose 0.1 to 109.7, up 2 per cent on the week. Among the insurers ING added Fl 2.30 to Fl 67.60 while Amev lost Fl 2.40 to Fl 71.10, on switching following results from both earlier this week. DUBLIN extended its gains on the week to 4.5 per cent as the ISEQ overall index rose 17.93 to 1,591.74, a placing of 55m shares in Irish Life at a 5 per cent discount to Thursday night's price being offset by a IPounds 1.15 a share bid for Fyffes, the fruit wholesaler, and another half-point base rate cut to 9 per cent. Dealers noted that Fyffes promptly outpaced the bid price, closing at IPounds 1.22 after IPounds 1.30, and that it took other food companies up with it. ISTANBUL continued its relentless drive higher, adding 5.3 per cent for a weekly rise of 8.7 per cent. The market index rose 374.23 to 7,341.37, firmly through the 7,000 level and establishing this month's eighth record high.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- April 16                                            THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                 Open       10.30      11.00     12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100         1159.66     1160.13    1159.60   1159.10 FT-SE Eurotrack 200         1220.29     1220.63    1220.89    1219.75  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                13.00       14.00      15.00     Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100         1159.35     1159.26    1159.97    1159.61 FT-SE Eurotrack 200         1217.00     1216.50    1218.33    1217.23  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Apr 15    Apr 14    Apr 13     Apr 8     Apr 7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1156.40   1160.63   1157.54   1151.40   1144.36 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1220.62   1223.50   1220.72   1211.28   1206.25  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value: 1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1160.84; 200 - 1221.60 Low/day: 100 - 1158.61 200 - 1215.59.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

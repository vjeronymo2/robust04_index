The statements by the UN generals that have served in  Bosnia-Herzegovina clearly express that the UN Administration  has done nothing in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It has not observed a  single UN resolution, and has brought its mission into an  extremely unenviable position. Our argument that the partition  of Bosnia, as preached by Lord Owen, forces over 1 million  people off their property -- therefore they lose their entire  private property -- has caused much confusion in the West [words  indistinct] based on private property. The question arises what  kind of a partition is it that takes rights from the people, Dr.  Ganic explained.    The Bosnia-Herzegovina attitude is to negotiate only if  there  are clear political principles. They were set out at the London  Conference but have in the meantime been abandoned. In order to  reach a solution those principles have to be implemented. A new  international conference -- not a European one, as Europe has  proven itself impotent and ineffective -- would involve the  problem of the entire region by defining principles and a moral  code of conduct.    With the announcement of the withdrawal of some Western  troops from Bosnia-Herzegovina, one has to take into account the  readiness of Turkey and some other countries to send in their  troops. That does not suit those who want to partition Bosnia,  Ganic believes. These factors initiated the Russian proposal,  which suits the Serbian aggressor. The Russians know that they  can have the majority when it comes to the partition of Bosnia,  and want thus to force the United Sates to accept that  partition. The aim is to drag the United States into such a  job. Everything speaks in favor of things returning to the  beginning, although that is what the Russians do not want,  Presidency member Ejup Ganic said.    Our Assembly has never accepted the partition of Bosnia, but  (?internal demarcation is possible). However, every citizen  must have the right to his property and the right to participate  in political decisionmaking. An attempt is being made to thwart  the strengthening of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army by an  unfavorable solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina. The drop in the  motivation of the Serb army and the drop in the living standards  in Serbia does not suit those who want to achieve their greater  state ambitions in this region. We are for peace, for a  cease-fire, and for a just solution, Ganic stressed in a  statement for B-H PRESS.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A PEIS is a broad-scale analysis of proposed programs or policies [40 CFR 1502.4(b)], including proposals with geographically connected actions [40 CFR 1502.4(c)(1)]. A SWEIS is a specific type of PEIS used to analyze connected actions at a DOE site [10 CFR 1021.330]. An agency follows the same steps to prepare a SWEIS as for an EIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Classified material.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department will review classified material while preparing the SWEIS. Within the limits of classification, DOE will provide to the public as much information as possible. If necessary, classified information will be segregated into a classified appendix.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Public involvement opportunities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department will conduct prescoping over the next few months. The results of prescoping will be provided in the NOI. Through this Advance Notice, DOE asks other Federal agencies, the State, tribal governments, local governments, and the general public to assist in identifying the scope of analysis for the SWEIS, including suggestions on issues, alternatives, and other topics of interest. As part of the prescoping process, DOE will hold a series of public information meetings and workshops, and provide other opportunities for public involvement. These will be publicized in local media at least two weeks in advance. Other Federal agencies, which perform work at LANL or manage land that might be affected by LANL activities, will be consulted about the SWEIS. Information briefings will be given to the State, affected tribes, and local governments. Other parties with an interest in LANL's operations, such as private companies having industrial partnerships with LANL, will be advised of the SWEIS process. The Department invites stakeholders to submit written comments on the content of the SWEIS and suggestions on the SWEIS review process, including suggestions for the conduct or format of public involvement opportunities, to the address given above. Comments received prior to October 31, 1994, will be considered in developing the proposed issues and alternatives for the NOI.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NOI will explain how comments and issues raised in the prescoping process have been incorporated into the suggested alternatives and issues identified in that Notice. Publication of the NOI will be followed by a second invitation to comment, public information meetings and workshops, and formal public scoping meetings. The results of the scoping process will be documented in an Implementation Plan which will be made available to the public. Other Federal agencies, the State, tribes, local governments, and the public will be given the opportunity to review and comment on the draft SWEIS and participate in public hearings. A final SWEIS will be prepared which will explain how public comments on the draft were considered. Following the final SWEIS, DOE intends to issue a ROD to document DOE's decisions regarding the operation of LANL and explain the measures identified to mitigate any adverse impacts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Copies of written comments, summaries of prescoping public meetings, and other materials pertaining to the development and analysis of the SWEIS will be made available for public review at the Los Alamos National Laboratory Community Reading Room, 1450 Central Ave., Suite 101, Los Alamos, New Mexico 87544. For information on the availability of specific documents and hours of operation, please contact the reading room at (505) 665&hyph;2127 or (800) 543&hyph;2342. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Signed in Washington D.C. this 4th day of August, 1994, for the United States Department of Energy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Tara O'Toole, M.D., M.P.H. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Assistant Secretary, Environment, Safety and Health.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

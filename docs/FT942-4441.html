			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: US broker in Dollars 33m compensation move PaineWebber, one of the largest US brokerage houses, is taking the highly unusual step of compensating investors in a government-bond fund for losses suffered in recent weeks. The firm is to pay Dollars 33m to buy back high-risk classes of mortgage-backed securities held by its Short-Term US Government Fund. The fund, which has about Dollars 1bn in assets, is managed by Mitchell Hutchins Asset Management, a PaineWebber subsidiary. Removing the securities from the fund's portfolio would diminish the potential for future volatility and reduced liquidity, PaineWebber said. The plan would help offset a sharp deterioration in the mutual fund's value since US interest rates began to rise in early February. In the past two months alone, its net asset value dropped 11 cents to Dollars 2.30, or about 4.5 per cent. Much of the downturn reflected the poor performance of the securities in question, known as collateralised mortgage obligations. Such derivatives, which are linked to payments on underlying pools of mortgages, have come under increasing pressure in an atmosphere of climbing rates. The firm said the securities, mostly acquired over the last year, contributed to 6 cents of the total decline in the fund's net asset value since late April. It said it would inject enough cash into the fund to make up the mortgage-related losses. PaineWebber is taking the steps as part of an agreement in principle to settle a class action suit filed by some of the fund's investors. Although the fund was not prohibited from including mortgage-backed securities, the prospectus made clear its managers would eschew such volatile financial instruments. As part of the settlement, PaineWebber would also make direct payments to investors who redeemed their shares after April 28.</p>

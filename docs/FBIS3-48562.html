The panel, comprising 10 legislators each from the House of  Representatives and the House of Councillors, held its first  meeting after the lower house decided to set up the committee at  a plenary session earlier in the day.    The last-ditch attempt to work out a compromise came after  the upper chamber voted down the Hosokawa administration's  reform package last Friday. A total of 20 Social Democratic  Party dissidents helped the opposition reject the package.    The meeting ended after only 10 minutes, having elected  Takushi Hirai, chief of Liberal Democratic Party upper house  member, as chairman of the panel. It agreed to meet again  Thursday afternoon.    If two-thirds of the 20-member joint panel agree on a  compromise plan, the amended version would then be sent to  plenary sessions of both houses of the Diet for a vote. The  bills would become law if passed by a majority vote of both  houses.    Meanwhile, the ruling coalition agreed to propose a  compromise plan which increases the number of seats allocated  for single-seat constituencies to 280 from the  government-proposed 274 seats, reducing the number of seats for  proportional representation from 226 to 220, coalition sources  said.    The compromise plan would also allow legislators of  prefectural and town assemblies to accept corporate donations.  The government package prohibits individual politicians from  receiving political donations from corporations, allowing only  political parties to receive such donations.    Earlier in the day, the coalition worked out a different  compromise version by which 300 single-seat districts would be  created, while the remaining 200 proportional representation  seats would be appropriated, they said.    That version, compiled at a meeting of the leaders of seven  coalition partners, also called for allowing business firms to  donate to individual Diet members.    However, the SDP, the biggest party in the coalition,  rejected the plan, expressing disaffection over the dropping of  a blanket ban on individual acceptance of corporate donations  from the compromise version, they said.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa told reporters he will make  his own decision on whether to resign or not if the pacakge is  scrapped.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said earlier in  the day he can neither confirm nor deny whether the prime  minister will resign if he fails to secure Diet approval for  political reform.    Asked about an adviser's comment on the possible resignation  of the cabinet depending on the result of Diet debate on reform,  the top government spokesman said, "I neither confirm nor deny  that."    Shusei Tanaka, a special adviser to Hosokawa, said Tuesday  the premier may disband the cabinet and step down if he fails to  get the measures put into law.    Hosokawa has pledged to take political responsibility if he  fails to achieve political reform during the current Diet  session, which ends Saturday. The package cleared the lower  house last November.    Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said  Hosokawa should dissolve the lower house for a snap general  election, rather than stepping down, if the political reform  program fails to win parliamentary approval by Saturday. "I  don't think a mass resignation of the cabinet is possible with  such a high level of public support," he said.    Hata also ruled out the possibility of carrying the  government reform proposals over to the next regular session of  the Diet, which begins next Monday.    With Saturday's closure of the current Diet session  approaching, the prospects of reaching a compromise over the  package at the Diet panel are poor because of major differences  between the coalition and the LDP.    The legislation could also become law if passed a second  time  by the lower chamber by a majority of two-thirds or more of the  members present.    However, the coalition will need about 70 LDP rebels to  secure a majority of two-thirds in the lower house and political  analysts predict such a case unlikely although the LDP is  divided over the package.    Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of  Employers Associations (Nikkeiren), a top business leader,  called for early compromise on the political reform package so  that the government can get down to the task of rebuilding  Japan's economy.</p>

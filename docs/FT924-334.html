			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Collor fails to delay judgment THE chief justice of the Brazilian Supreme Court yesterday denied a last-minute request by suspended President Fernando Collor de Mello to delay judgment by the Senate on his impeachment. Mr Collor, who was suspended from office in September for alleged corruption, will be permanently removed from office if the upper house of the legislature convicts him today, as expected. Chief Justice Sydney Sanches rejected a suit filed by Mr Collor asking for an additional 30 days to allow his new lawyer to prepare arguments. Mr Collor dismissed his attorneys last Tuesday, on the eve of the original trial date, forcing the Supreme Court to postpone the Senate hearing until today. However, Mr Sanches accepted Mr Jose de Moura Rocha as Mr Collor's new defence attorney. The judge also maintained a court-appointed counsel, named after Mr Collor dismissed his attorneys. Mr Mauro Benevides, president of the Senate, said he expected all 81 members of the upper house to appear at the special session. Opinion polls have shown that pro-impeachment forces, who need a two-thirds majority, should have enough votes to remove Mr Collor from office. An aide to Mr Benevides said the Senate president planned to keep the parliament in session until a final outcome was reached. Mr Collor, the country's first democratically elected president in several decades, is facing charges of official misconduct, including allegations that he personally benefited from a multi-million dollar slush fund run by his former campaign treasurer. If Mr Collor is removed from office, interim president Itamar Franco, Mr Collor's vice-presidential running mate in the 1989 campaign, should be formally inaugurated tomorrow.</p>

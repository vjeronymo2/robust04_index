			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Arabs 'willing to resume peace talks' MR Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, yesterday told Israeli leaders that Arab countries were willing to resume peace talks which have been stalled since December when 415 Palestinians were expelled from the country. On the last and toughest leg of his tour of the Middle East, Mr Christopher met Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister; Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister; Mr Ehud Barak, army chief-of-staff; and the heads of the Israeli delegations to the peace talks, who expressed their similar desire for the peace negotiations to be revived. However, Palestinians insist that all the deportees should be repatriated before the talks resume. Mr Christopher last night met Palestinian leaders. Their spokeswoman, Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, told him she thought it unlikely peace talks would resume under present conditions, despite indications that Israel might be ready to make further concessions on the deportees. Israeli officials said the message they had received from the US secretary of state was that the Arab countries had softened their stance and were willing to return to the negotiating table. This the Arabs would be prepared to do even without the immediate return of all the deportees, although further concessions on Jerusalem's part were expected. Under international pressure, Israel agreed three weeks ago to allow 101 deportees to return and to halve the expulsion terms of the rest to one year. 'Our impression from the meeting is that at least, insofar as the Arab countries are concerned, the deportee issue has not been presented as a condition for resuming the peace process,' said Mr Gad Ben-Ari, the prime minister's spokesman. 'It's an issue for which we will have to find a solution, but it is certainly not a condition for reviving the talks.' During his meeting with Mr Rabin, the US secretary of state was reported to have raised the issue of human rights violations in the occupied territories. He was told by the prime minister that Israel would like to delegate more power to the Palestinians, although not at the expense of its own security. Mr Yossi Beilin, deputy foreign minister, said he understood from Mr Christopher that the US intended to increase its involvement in the Middle East peace talks. However, 'I think the most important message given by the secretary of state is that after his recent tour he sees there is a chance to advance the peace process. As far as we are concerned, this is the best news,' he added.</p>

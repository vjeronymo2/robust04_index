			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tang Dongning [3282 2639 1337]: ``Knowledge </F> Engineering: A Key to 21st-Century S&amp;T Development'']    [Summary] This writer is fortunate to have been granted an  interview with fuzzy mathematics theory and applications  specialist Prof. Wang Peizhuang [3076 1014 8369] of the Fuzzy  Mathematics Institute at Beijing Teachers' University. This  world-renowned scholar, China People's Political Consultative  Committee member and concurrently China Branch Director of the  International Fuzzy Systems Association (IFSA), expounded on the  history of fuzzy mathematics theory and applications in China  and on the bright prospects for applications of fuzzy logic in  the S&amp;T of the coming century. One of the specific benchmarks  he brought up was his research team's development of the world's  second prototype computer built with fuzzy inference engine  discrete components; Dr. Wang's team achieved a 50 percent  increase in speed [from 10 million inferences per second to 15  million inferences per second] and a reduction of 90 percent in  the machine's physical volume compared to the world's first such  prototype, developed by Japanese Professor Takeshi Yamakawa and  announced on [11 July] 1987 [details in JPRS-CST-88-014, 25 Jul  88 pp 116-117 and in JPRS-CST-90-027, 29 Oct 90 pp 13-14]. Dr.  Wang also mentioned China's world-class research on fuzzy  control of inverted pendulums [details in JPRS-CST-92-012, 18  Jun 92 p 53]. Finally, he stressed the value of knowledge  engineering in future development of a variety of disciplines,  including weather forecasting, seismology, industry (especially  metallurgy), home electronics, economic planning, management,  transport, banking and finance, and education.</p>

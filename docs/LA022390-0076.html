			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVE TO HONOR ARMENIANS FAILS IN SENATE  </P> <P> Senate supporters of a resolution commemorating the killings of 1.5 million  Armenians by the Ottoman Turks early this century were unable to end a  filibuster Thursday by senators who wish to avoid offending Turkey and who fear  the resolution could create a major diplomatic crisis.  </P> <P> After more than two days of emotion-charged debate, the Senate split down the  middle, voting 49-49 on a procedural motion to cut off debate. The outcome was  a setback for supporters of the resolution, who needed 60 votes -- a  three-fifths majority -- of the Senate to break the filibuster and proceed to a  vote.  </P> <P> The filibuster was led by Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) who called the  resolution "a foreign policy disaster in the making."  </P> <P> Noting the narrowness of the vote, however, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole  (R.-Kan.) vowed to try again next week after making changes in the resolution  that he said will satisfy the Bush Administration's objections.  </P> <P> Senate aides said the two senators not present for the vote -- Dan Coats  (R-Ind.) and Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) -- are both likely to side with Dole  when the motion comes up again next Tuesday, leaving the Republican leader  still nine votes short.  </P> <P> Dole said that in addition to having its language changed, the measure would be  offered again in a different, non-binding form that would not require a  presidential signature -- and that he hopes the changes will persuade enough  senators to switch sides by next week.  </P> <P> The resolution, sponsored by Dole, would have the Senate honor the memory of  1.5 million Armenians killed by the Ottoman Turks by designating April 24 a  national "day of remembrance" on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of "the  Armenian genocide of 1915-23."  </P> <P> While Congress routinely passes commemorative resolutions having little or no  practical policy impact, the unusually bitter controversy surrounding this one  stems from one emotionally charged word: genocide.  </P> <P> No one disputes that hundreds of thousands of Armenians died during the waning  days of the Ottoman Empire. But Turkey, now an important North Atlantic Treaty  Organization ally, disputes the manner of their deaths and vehemently denies  allegations of genocide. In an intensive lobbying campaign, its representatives  here have warned that passage of even a symbolic resolution will provoke a  crisis in U.S.-Turkish relations if the word genocide is mentioned.  </P></p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Fortunes diverge for UK insurers: Varied exposure to housing market has created contrasting results Fortunes in the UK insurance industry appear split following the publication this week of the first-half results of three of the biggest composite (general and life) companies. Interim figures show General Accident and Commercial Union clawing their way back to profit after internal rationalisation, price increases and tighter underwriting disciplines imposed in the wake of the industry's worst ever losses in 1990 and 1991. General Accident made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 9.5m in the three months to June and slashed its six-month losses to Pounds 21.2m compared with a Pounds 105m deficit at the halfway stage last year. Commercial Union reported a profit of Pounds 2.3m for the second quarter and reduced its six-month loss to Pounds 18.1m. But in spite of implementing the same recovery measures, Royal Insurance is still submerged under the weight of losses stemming from the slump in the housing market and the high level of repossessions. Claims and provisions on its book of domestic mortgage indemnity, or DMI policies - which cover mortgage lenders against losses on the sales of repossessed properties - cost Royal Pounds 100m in the first half, converting a small profit on other lines into a pre-tax loss of Pounds 79m. Although that represents an Pounds 18m improvement on last year, the company faces at least another Pounds 150m of mortgage indemnity claims over the next 18 months, depressing future prospects. Mr Roy Elms, director of underwriting, said: 'We've got that albatross around our neck. Anybody who doesn't have it has a tremendous advantage over us.' 'DMI is a bloody curse,' added Mr Richard Gamble, chief executive. Royal's overall losses from mortgage indemnity between 1990 and 1993 will cost the company more than Pounds 500m, an amount equivalent to more than a third of its capital and reserves at the end of June. Underwriting losses from mortgage indemnity for the whole industry between 1991 and 1993 could reach Pounds 2.6bn, according to SG Warburg, the securities house. Some analysts are talking about a 'decoupling' of the sector in which those companies least exposed to mortgage indemnity difficulties will be able to take advantage of the upturn in pricing and grow at the expense of their hard-hit rivals, which, as well as Royal, include Eagle Star (a market share of DMI of about 15 per cent) and Sun Alliance (which has more than 20 per cent of the DMI market). Sun Alliance, the biggest and most powerful UK insurer in the 1980s, is doubly disadvantaged by the severity of the UK recession because of its heavy investment exposure to UK equities, according to some observers. This week's results show that GA and particularly CU are well placed to take advantage of the problems of their rivals. Both companies are raising capital to finance possible expansion. GA is seeking shareholders' permission to issue up to Pounds 300m in preference shares in order to increase its room for manoeuvre in the upturn, while CU launched a successful Pounds 100m preference issue in May and has increased its share of the UK market over the past 18 months. Mr Paul Hodges, analyst with James Capel, the securities house, says observers have 'perhaps underestimated how quickly the companies could recover'. At any rate, analysts believe that exposure to mortgage indemnity will become an increasingly important factor in insurance share ratings. Mr Tom Bennett, of securities house Banque Paribas Capital Markets, who has posted buy notices on the three companies - CU, GA and Guardian Royal Exchange - least exposed to the housing market, said: 'These guys are sitting pretty. Their major competitors have been shot to pieces by DMI.'</p>

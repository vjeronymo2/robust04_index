			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> GEORGIA;  </P> <P> MEASLES DEATHS SOAR TO 18-YEAR HIGH  </P> <P> The measles explosion of 1989, involving unvaccinated preschoolers and  schoolchildren whose shots didn't work, has been accompanied by the most  measles deaths in 18 years, federal health officials said. Forty-two deaths  from measles have been reported this year, the Atlanta-based Centers for  Disease Control said. That's the largest death count since 90 in 1971, a CDC  spokesman noted. Nationwide, 14,714 measles cases were counted with two weeks  left in the year, the CDC reported. That's more than five times the 2,876 cases  reported at this point a year ago. Large measles outbreaks are continuing in  Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston, primarily among young blacks and Latinos, the  CDC noted.  </P></p>

Police used water cannon to drive off 100 students marching  on the prime minister's office here on Wednesday to protest  against the death of 10 students killed in a road accident.  Some students also set fire to the university vice chancellor's  offices to object to a decision to transfer courses for 15,000  students to the new Yaounde II premises, where there are neither  drinking water nor canteen facilities.    Angry undergraduates said their fellows were killed when a  minibus taking them to university was in collision at dawn with  a truck on the outskirts of town.    Students are also calling for transport to be laid on. For  lack of buses, they are often forced to hitch rides on trucks  carrying sand on the road from Yaounde to Sao, 13 kilometres  (eight miles) from the capital, where the university lies.    The urban transport authority introduced a new route two  weeks ago, but the buses ran for just three days before breaking  down.    In another development Thursday, the government suspended  the  salaries of 73 teachers who have been on strike since November  24. Prime Minister Simon Achidi Achu had Tuesday warned of  measures against striking civil servants.</p>

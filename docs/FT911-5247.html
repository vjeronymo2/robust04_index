			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Observer: Back in the running Could the next United Nations secretary-general be Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, just appointed to co-ordinate all UN humanitarian operations in the Gulf? An undeclared but interested candidate, he seemed to suffer a setback when Finland's Martti Ahtisaari, a senior UN official with similar aspirations, was named to conduct an on-the-spot assessment of the war's effects on civilians in Iraq and Kuwait. Prince Sadruddin, already in charge of UN humanitarian aid, resigned in a huff. Ahtisaari's emotive report, speaking of the 'near-apocalyptic' results of allied bombing reducing a formerly prosperous Iraq to the 'pre-industrial age', did not go down well in Washington and London. President Bush is said to have proposed personally to current secretary-general Javier Perez de Cuellar that the 58-year-old French-born prince be restored at the first opportunity. A former UN high commissioner for refugees, he has now been entitled executive delegate. That means he will in effect be the secretary-general's deputy, standing in for him at all inter-agency meetings on the Gulf. He has at least 35 rivals to replace Perez de Cuellar when his term expires at the year-end, including representatives of African states who believe it is their turn. But as the veto-holding US and UK have emphasised that the top UN job is not subject to the rule of equitable geographic distribution, prospects of an African secretary-general seem slight.</p>

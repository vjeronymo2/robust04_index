			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW DROPS BACK 0.68 AFTER A WEEK OF GAINS  </P> <P> The stock market was mixed today, pausing after more than a week of steady  gains.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 93.83 points over the past seven  sessions, slipped 0.68 to 2,732.88.  </P> <P> Advancing issues edged out declines on the New York Stock Exchange, with 755  up, 723 down and 505 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 152.22 million shares, against 144.23 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index rose .38 to 187.49.  </P> <P> Interest rates moved higher in the credit markets today. Prices of long-term  government bonds dropped more than $5 for each $1,000 in face value, increasing  their yields to the 8.89% -8.93% range.  </P> <P> Analysts said both the stock and bond markets seemed to be on hold awaiting  results from the Treasury's quarterly auction of bonds and notes.  </P> <P> Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist for Kleinwort Benson government  Securities Inc. in Chicago, attributed the price drop to "nervousness around  auction time".  </P> <P> A warm reception was reported Tuesday for the first of the offering's three  installments, a $10.5-billion sale of three-year notes.  </P> <P> The financing continued with the sale of $10 billion in 10-year notes today,  and winds up with $10 billion in 30-year bonds on Thursday.  </P> <P> But market watchers warned that strong demand for three-year notes may not  necessarily mean equal demand for longer-dated issues.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments  fell this morning by 1/16 to 3/32 point, intermediate maturities fell 1/4 point  to 9/32 point, and long-term issues were down 9/32 point to 11/32 point,  according to Telerate Inc., the financial information service.  </P> <P> The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond  with a $1,000 face value.  </P> <P> The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price  movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or  longer, fell 1.78 to 1,138.86.  </P> <P> Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.05% as the discount rose 1 basis  point to 7.79%. Yields on six-month bills fell to 8.20% as the discount fell 1  basis point to 7.78%. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.40% as the discount  rose 2 basis points to 7.80%.  </P> <P> A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the  annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the  percentage that bills are selling below the face value.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight  loans, was quoted at 8 1/8%, down from 8 3/16% late Tuesday.  </P></p>

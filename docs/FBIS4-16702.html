			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian-Estonian commission controlling the  observance of the treaty on the principles of bilateral  relations proposed that the Russian and Estonian foreign  ministries and state delegations "freeze" the border issue for  ten years, the commission's co-chairman Nikolay Medvedev told  Interfax on Tuesday.    He said that Russia favored the idea of demarcating the  Estonian- Russian border and granting it a state status.  "Estonia has neither directly accepted it, nor objected to it  in principle," he said.    The border dispute between Russia and Estonia still remains  unsettled. Tallinn does not recognize the current borders,  because in accordance with the Tartu treaty signed back in 1920,  Estonia included some of the regions which were joined to Russia  during and after World War II.    "We want to secede from Russia with the same territory we  had  when we joined it," the commission co-chairman Enn Leison told  Interfax. He pointed out, however, that Estonia did not seek  the return of the territories in which ethnic Russians  constituted 60 percent. "We wouldn't like to have non-natives  added to Estonia," he said.    On April 18 and 19, the commission members met in Moscow to  discuss social guarantees for Russian military pensioners living  in Estonia, and the most favored nations trade regime provided  for in the bilateral treaty.    The next session will be held in Estonia on May 15.</p>

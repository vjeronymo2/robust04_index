			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: Uni Storebrand rescue plan attacked CB CAPITAL Bank, a Swiss investment bank which is the largest foreign shareholder in Uni Storebrand, yesterday attacked one of three restructuring plans being considered for the Norwegian insurer. Mr Leon Genoud, chairman of CB Bank which owns 4.1 per cent of Uni Storebrand capital, said the financial restructuring would be 'discriminatory of present shareholders, especially foreign ones.' The plan, in part, calls for a syndicate of 35 Norwegian companies to underwrite capital issues of NKr2.8bn (Dollars 413m), including NKr1bn in new equity capital. Some 50 per cent of the new share issue will be reserved for members of the syndicate. One proposal is that the face value of existing shares should be written down from NKr20 to NKr10. Details of the other two plans, which have been formulated by an alliance of creditors, potential new investors and the administrators, have not been released. Mr Erik Keiserud, Uni Storebrand chairman, declined to comment on the Swiss banker's comments. 'We will take his views into consideration,' he said. Uni Storebrand collapsed last year after over-extending its finances by a hostile raid on Skandia, the Swedish insurance group. Mr Genoud said he would have no objection to the plan if existing shareholders were free to offer to buy all of the 280m new shares, with the syndicate underwriting any which remain unsold. In a letter to Mr Keiserud, he writes: 'To pretend that the equity of the Uni share is less than the nominal value of NKr20 is an insult to bookkeeping and to common sense.' Mr Genoud, using figures from the Uni Storebrand annual report, claims that the book value of Uni shares at the end of last year was NKr54.40 per share, the 'real value' was NKr103.50. The shares last traded at NKr13.30.</p>

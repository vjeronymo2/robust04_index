Mr John Major said yesterday that he wants Germany to play  "a  full part" in next year's VE-Day commemoration which will  include a service in St Paul's and the parade through the  capital.    The Prime Minister's comments reflect his concern to ease  German feelings over their exclusion from this summer's D-Day  celebrations and he has told Herr Helmut Kohl, the German  Chancellor, that it is the 1995 end-of-war services which really  count.    Herr Kohl is still smarting at his exclusion from plans for  Western leaders to mark the 50th anniversary of D-Day with an  Allied service of remembrance at Normandy.    His efforts to secure a place at the service were roundly  rebuffed as other governments protested that D-Day celebrations  should be restricted to those countries whose men died trying to  liberate Europe and that a German presence would not be fitting.    In an effort to salve German pride Mr Major has stressed the  importance of the 1995 celebrations to Herr Kohl, saying that  would be the right occasion to mark the years of reconciliation  and friendship which followed the Nazis' defeat.    Yesterday he showed his wish to avoid further offence in a  Commons written answer to Sir James Spicer, the Tory MP for  Dorset West. He said the commemoration in Britain on May 7,  1995, "will be the occasion to celebrate the 50 years of peace  and reconciliation we have enjoyed since 1945."    Mr Major said: "During that time we have developed extremely  close relations with our allies and partners in Germany. We very  much hope Germany will play a full part and be represented at a  high level in the 1995 commemorations."    He went on to list the main events in the commemoration as a  parade in central London, a service in St Paul's and a lunch or  dinner for the heads of government who attend. Downing Street  sources said that the plans were still at an early stage and  refused to rule out the possibility of German troops or even  ex-servicemen taking part in the parade .    Inviting members of the present German armed forces could be  considered a suitable alternative and far less controversial  than allowing German veterans to join the parade. MPs would  argue that such men would represent the new Germany with which  Britain is a close ally rather than the old enemy.    The proposals provoked a mixed reaction among Tory MPs,  particularly those who served with the Armed Forces.    Sir James, a retired major who served in the Royal Fusiliers  and the Paras, backed the decision. "We want to see a coming  together and a remembrance of the past in order to avoid it ever  happening again," he said.    But Sir Teddy Taylor, the Tory MP for Southend East, said:  "There are still many people in Britain who have suffered severe  loss of their loved ones -- fathers, sons, brothers and sisters  -- and we should remember their tragedy first."</p>

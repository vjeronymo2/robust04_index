			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 14 Apr (MENA)-- The Egyptian force taking  part in the UN peacekeeping forces in Somalia checked an  offensive by an armed Somali group against a UN ammunition depot  southwest of Mogadishu airport on 12 April.    An official military source today stated that the Egyptian  force fired warning shots to deter the attackers. To deter the  repeated attempts against the depot, it had to surround the  group members and engaged them in a 35-minute clash, after which  they surrendered.    The source added that the Egyptian force turned the group  members, who numbered 19, over to the Somali police, adding that  the Egyptian force sustained no losses.    Defense and War Production Minister Field Marshal Muhammad  Husayn Tantawi thanked the commander, officers, and soldiers of  the Egyptian force in Somalia for their vigilance and good  performance.    The UN commander in Somalia also thanked the Egyptian force  for its distinguished performance in frustrating an attempt to  seize the UN ammunition.</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Morgan Stanley to monitor Dollars 2bn aid for PLO The Palestine Liberation Organisation said yesterday it had chosen Morgan Stanley Asset Management, fund management arm of the US-based investment bank, to monitor more than Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) in international aid committed to the West Bank and Gaza Strip over the next five years. The appointment was made to allay international fears about the control and direction of the funds, particularly that they should not be diverted to political purposes. Morgan Stanley has had significant business interests in the Arab Middle East but has also advised Israel in arranging debt finance for its US-guaranteed loans programme. The bank's MSAM division has about Dollars 50bn in assets under management. In a statement from its Tunis headquarters, the PLO said the involvement of Morgan Stanley would 'help assure contributing nations that the funds provided directly to the Palestinian National Authority would be managed with total transparency in a highly skilled and professional manner'. Total international aid commitments to the Palestinians stand at about Dollars 2.8bn over the next five years. This includes grants, concessionary loans, loan guarantees and aid from the UN Relief and Works Agency. About Dollars 2.1bn can be considered 'new' commitments made after the interim self-rule agreement signed by Israel and the PLO in Washington on September 13. Some Dollars 800m has been pledged for the first year of interim Palestinian self-rule but some donors, such as Saudi Arabia, have been reluctant to commit themselves beyond that. Officials in Riyadh, still angered by the PLO's support for Iraq during the Gulf war, have said they wanted to be certain every dollar went to specific infrastructure projects and nothing to Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman. The World Bank is co-ordinating the international aid effort but has not taken responsibility for liaising on specific projects or acting as a channel for the flow of money to the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction (Pecdar). Fears had been raised among donors that the membership of Pecdar, headed by Mr Arafat, was too heavily politicised and lacked technical expertise. As a result it it likely that Pecdar's main board will only set the broad policy outlines, leaving detailed work to Mr Ahmed Qurie, also known as Abu Ala, director-general, and departments under him. Palestinians associated with Pecdar insist they will soon have mechanisms for accounting and maintaining control over the council's spending.</p>

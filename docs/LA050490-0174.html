			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> W. GERMAN WORKERS, EMPLOYERS AGREE ON 35-HOUR WORKWEEK  </P> <P> Employers and striking metal workers in a central region of West Germany agreed  in a landmark accord today to cut the workweek by two hours in stages to 35  hours, averting the prospect of a potentially damaging nationwide strike.  </P> <P> IG Metall, the Western World's biggest union, said in a statement that its  members in the steel, car and engineering industries in Northern  Wuerttemberg-Northern Baden will work a 35-hour week from October, 1995, on.  </P> <P> Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government had said the country cannot afford a  shorter workweek at a time when it needs to finance the costs of German  unification.  </P> <P> The reduction in the current 37-hour week will come in two steps with a  one-hour cut being introduced from April, 1993. Wages of workers covered by the  agreement will be raised 6% from July this year, IG Metall said.  </P></p>

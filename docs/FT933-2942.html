			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Too one-sided a presentation Sir, While the need to provide a brief summary of complicated events can lead to a less than exhaustive history, the 'chronology of the (Middle East) conflict' in your August 31 edition is nothing less than a distortion of history ('Peace plan poised on a hair trigger'). Summarising the 1948 Arab rejection of the UN partition plan, and Israel's war of independence against the invading armies of surrounding Arab states as 'first Arab-Israeli war, Israel annexes large portions of proposed Arab state in Palestine' is bad enough. Ignoring acts of war initiated by Arab states in 1967, the threat to Israel's existence in June 1967, and the defensive nature of the Six-Day war by presenting it as 'Israel attacks Egypt, Syria and Jordan' is either a slavish presentation of false propaganda, or an insult to your readers' knowledge and intelligence, or both.

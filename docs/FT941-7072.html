			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Euro Conservatives: no links, similar whips (2) Sir, Sir Teddy Taylor complains ('Tories split over European allies' federal stance in poll manifesto') that British Conservative MPs are whipped along Westminster lines in the Parliamentary Group of the European People's party. I am proud that we are, because I introduced the system to our continental colleagues. It is regularly used to our advantage, for example to defeat the parliament's left-wing majority's 'no confidence' motion in the British presidency of the council. Of course, the whip does not have the same power and patronage as at Westminster, because there is no European government to defend or bring down. From time to time all national sections of the EPP decline the group whip, when their individual party or national interest is in conflict with it. Long may that practice continue. Richard Simmonds, chief whip, British Conservative MEPs, Woodlands Farm, Cookham Dean, Maidenhead, Berks SL6 9PL</p>

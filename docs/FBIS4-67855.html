			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [``Roundup'' by reporter Gao Haorong (7559 3185 2837): </F> ``The United States Deploys Guided Missiles and the DPRK  Opposes the Exertion of Pressure'']    [Text] Pyongyang, 7 Apr (XINHUA) -- Acting on U.S.  President Clinton's 21 March orders, two U.S. transport ships  carrying 48 Patriot missile launchers set sail from Oakland in  early April and are scheduled to arrive in the ROK before the  end of the month. It has been reported the Patriots will be  deployed around Seoul.    As early as the beginning of this year, the United States  and  the ROK agreed in principle to deploy Patriot missiles on U.S.  military bases in the ROK to deal with ``threats from the  North.'' The missile deployment plan was strongly criticized by  the DPRK. Later, the situation on the Korean Peninsula became  relaxed; the Patriot missile deployment plan was shelved after  the DPRK reached agreements separately with the IAEA and the  United States on the settlement of the nuclear issue, and North  and South Korea resumed consultations on an exchange of special  envoys.    Recently, the settlement of the DPRK nuclear issue again  encountered difficulties as the various parties have completely  different appraisals of the results of the IAEA's early March  inspection of the DPRK's nuclear facilities. Against such a  background, the United States has revived its plan to deploy  Patriot missiles in the ROK.    The U.S. deployment of Patriot missiles aroused strong  opposition from the DPRK. On 28 March, a DPRK Foreign Ministry  spokesman issued a statement saying the Patriot missiles to be  deployed to the ROK are an improved model, which can be used as  an offensive weapon and can hit any target on the Korean  Peninsula due to the local terrain. For this reason, the U.S.  description of the Patriot deployment as ``purely defensive'' is  groundless. Moreover, the deployment seriously violates  relevant provisions of the Korea armistice agreement and it is a  ``dangerous military action'' intensifying the situation on the  Korean Peninsula. The DPRK has repeatedly reiterated that it  hopes the nuclear issue will be resolved through dialogue, and  the exertion of pressure will not resolve the issue but will  only make it more complex.    Over the last several days, there have been mass rallies in  Pyongyang, Haeju, and Kaesong Cities, opposing the U.S.  deployment of nuclear weapons in the ROK; and criticizing the  U.S. action as an ``open threat'' to the DPRK and as an  intentional act to worsen the situation on the Korean Peninsula.  Participants in the rallies have demanded the United States  halt the Patriot missile deployment immediately, and have said  they will be on the alert against the U.S. action.</p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / World Trade News: TI, Sanyo drop US legal actions TEXAS Instruments (TI), the US semiconductor maker, and Sanyo Electric of Japan have dropped legal action against each other in the US courts, they said yesterday. The move came after they signed a semiconductor patent cross-licence agreement, but left unresolved a key dispute over a TI patent covering basic chip technology in Japan. The unresolved dispute leaves open the possibility of renewed legal action in the Japanese courts; both companies said they retained the ability to pursue their rights in Japan. The cross-licence agreement, running until November 1996, brings part-resolution to one of the most bitter patent rights disputes between US and Japanese companies. TI and other US companies have been increasingly aggressive in recent years in seeking to obtain royalty payments for intellectual property. In June, TI filed a patent infringement suit against Sanyo in the US and sought a judgment that the conduct of its talks with Sanyo did not constitute a misuse of patents or anti-trust violation. In July, Sanyo filed anti-trust and breach of contract suits against TI in the US courts. Sanyo said then that TI was trying to force it to sign an agreement for TI's Kilby semiconductor patent which Sanyo said it did not use. TI believes the patent applies to all semiconductor devices made in Japan. The agreement between the two companies establishes royalty payments which Sanyo will make to TI for semiconductor technology, but excludes the Kilby patent. Neither company said how the Kilby patent dispute would be resolved, but it is likely they will wait for the outcome of a current legal action in Japan between TI and Fujitsu. Fujitsu and TI were also unable to reach agreement over applicability of the Kilby patent and sought a determination from the court on whether the patent applied to semiconductor devices made by Fujitsu.</p>

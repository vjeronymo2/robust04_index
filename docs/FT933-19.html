			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (27): The furnace gets hotter - Steel makers face escalating competition FOR A sector whose product pricing and distribution were for so long tightly controlled by the federal government, India's steel industry has been quick to respond to the free market challenge following the lifting of controls in January last year. Imports of steel have become easier with the lowering of duty across the board and the government is likely to reduce the import tariff even further in the next budget. The Steel Authority of India Limited (Sail), a state undertaking, and Tata Iron and Steel Company (Tisco), which in the past operated in a highly protected market, are putting as much effort into selling steel as producing it. Fears that the main producers such as Sail and Tisco would raise steel prices sharply following decontrol have been proved wrong. Relaxation of prices and distribution coincided with the domestic recession in the demand for steel which meant steel prices could not be raised arbitrarily. Moreover, Indian manufacturers are now competing in the domestic market with imported products. 'The Indian steel industry can no longer operate on a cost plus basis,' says B. Muthuraman, director of marketing of Tisco. 'It will have to protect its margins by improving operational efficiency and controlling costs. The consumer now has the option of importing anything. The domestic industry knows it could be outpriced by imported material.' While Indian producers have so far withstood competition from imports, they also have succeeded in raising export sharply from 380,000 tonnes in 1991-92 to 900,000 tonnes in 1992-93. Exports are expected to rise to 2.37m tonnes in the current year. According to the ministry of steel, export income from steel in 1993-94 will be Rs17bn, while imports will cost Rs16.95bn, making India a net exporter of steel. U. K. Mittal, executive director of Sail, said the sharp rise in exports could be attributed to the large-scale buying of steel by China and the devaluation of the Indian currency. China has, however, recently reduced its steel imports. 'We are aware of the risk of depending too much on a single market. We think we should be able to find buyers in West Asia and Taiwan,' Mr Mittal said. Tisco has taken a different approach. Instead of heavy dependence on China, it has nursed markets such as west Asia, Taiwan, Thailand, Sri Lanka and Nepal. Tisco's Mr Muthuraman said India should progressively reduce the shipment of billets and raise the export of value added items such as wire rods, structurals and plates. India is not aiming to be a leader in the international steel trade. Its export target is about 5m tonnes of steel by the turn of the century when domestic demand for the metal will be 30m tonnes, against about 18m tonnes now. The focus for exports will be the Pacific Rim countries where the demand for steel is expected to grow fast. With the throwing open of the Indian market to imports the indigenous industry is finding it needs to pull itself into shape. There is a 'substantial overhang of obsolete technology and equipment in the Indian steel industry, resulting in a relatively higher cost of production and a product quality short of international standards,' says Dr J. J. Irani, managing director of Tisco. Controls on integrated plants using the blast furnace route of steel production meant sufficient resources could not be generated to modernise and expand. As a result, the industry has not been able to benefit from technological breakthroughs in steelmaking. The Indian industry which until the mid-1960s was highly cost competitive, now uses 50 to 100 per cent more energy than steel producers elsewhere. Energy inefficient open hearth furnaces need to be replaced by basic oxygen furnaces while the share of the highly cost-effective continuous casting method needs to be greatly increased from the present 25 per cent. Indian blast furnaces now produce 1.2 tonnes per cubic metre of steel compared with the world average of 2 tonnes. Dr Irani believes a 30 per cent improvement in productivity over a five-year period would permit production of an extra 4m tonnes of hot metal from existing Indian blast furnaces. Sail's seven-year Rs150bn capital expenditure programme and Tisco's phase III modernisation and capacity expansion to 3.05m tonnes by 1995 will eliminate many of the weaknesses of integrated steel plants. But low labour productivity and overmanning of steel plants will remain a problem. Indian productivity is 30 to 85 ingot tonnes per man per year, against about 400 ingot tonnes per man per year in efficient steel-producing countries. As a result, India is not able to take full advantage of its cheap labour. Rationalisation of the labour force will be possible only when the federal government has mustered the courage to introduce its much debated exit policy. Controls have also created serious distortions in the secondary steel sector which includes units making steel in electric arc furnaces (EAFs). EAFs are normally used to produce high value special and alloy steel. In India, however, EAF units, which were not covered by price and distribution controls, took the easy route of producing mild steel. EAF units account for more than 30 per cent of the Indian steel industry's capacity of 26m tonnes. The removal of controls has played havoc with the EAF units. 'Nearly 50 per cent of EAF capacity is lying closed,' Mr Alak Saha, joint director of marketing at Tisco, said. 'The EAF units can no longer indulge in the luxury of using imported scrap and expensive power to make mild steel. Only the ones producing special and alloy steel such as Mukund and Mahindra Ugine will survive in the long run.' Before the introduction of reforms, the state sector was the force driving the creation of steelmaking capacity. Now the federal government says that, except for modernising existing plants, it will not invest in new steel projects. But India needs to produce a lot more steel. Its per capita consumption is only 25 kg against the world average of more than 150 kg. The government has identified 25 sites in 10 states where the private sector can set up new steel plants incorporating the latest technologies. The private sector has come up with 16 major investment proposals, the most ambitious being the 3m tonne capacity steel plant to be set up by the Caparo Group of the UK at Daitari in Orissa. Mr Swraj Paul, chairman of Caparo Group, says: 'We will bring the latest technologies to India. Ours will be a model project.' The steel ministry says these projects will see the light of day provided they are offered a suitable package of incentives, including the import of plants and machinery at a low rate of duty and exemption from tax in the first few years of production. The finance ministry has to nod in agreement.</p>

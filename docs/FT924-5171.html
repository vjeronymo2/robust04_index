			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / The Royals who paid up Queen Victoria volunteered to pay income tax when it was introduced in 1842, prompted by her prime minister, Sir Robert Peel. Her successor, Edward VII, tried to avoid income tax in 1901, but was advised by Lord Salisbury's Conservative government to pay up. It was his son, George V, who managed to get income tax removed from the civil list in 1910. The Treasury was persuaded in 1932 to lift tax on income from Duchy of Lancaster rents, but the monarch continued to pay tax on private investments until 1937, during the reign of George VI, the Queen's father.</p>

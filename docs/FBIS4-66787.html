			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Punam I. Kaushish: "The U.S. Proposal Is Against India's </F> Interest and in Favor of Pakistan"]    [Text] Do you remember an incident related to Kennedy?  During his talks with President Chiari of Panama, he turned to  one of his assistants and said, "I am not managing this  negotiation very well." The assistant asked, "What makes you  think that?" Kennedy responded, "He says that we had committed  atrocities on them in the past, and I agree with him."    The time has changed from Kennedy to Clinton and the  situation has changed from Panama Canal to India. The United  States has traveled far. However, the president's talks are the  same. Except that Bill Clinton will not admit that the United  States has been nasty to India. Robin Raphel will never admit  that the United States favors Pakistan. Strobe Talbott cannot  deny that the relationship between India and the United States  has soured. Winter goes and summer comes, however, from the  deputy state secretary to the President, everyone curses India  with full ardor be it the issue of human rights violations or  Sikhs rights or the Kashmir issue.    We hope from Talbott's recent visit to India a new chapter  will be added to India-United States relations. He did try to  soothe India over Kashmir and human rights. He spent most of his  time explaining the Clinton government's South Asia policy. It  emphasizes nuclear non-proliferation and tells how the nuclear  capability of India and Pakistan can be controlled. He talked  about making South Asia nuclear free and kept India and Pakistan  talking about non-proliferation while discussing the interests  of a platform of nine countries including the United States,  England, France, Russia, China, Japan, Germany, India, and  Pakistan.    This sends out a clear message. The United States wants to  remain the only superpower in the world. It wants to pressure  India to terminate its nuclear and missiles programs. Washington  understands that India will not bow down under U.S. pressure.  Thus, it will adopt a policy that serves U.S. interests.    There are two aspects of this plan. First, Prime Minister  Narasimha Rao has received an invitation from President Clinton  to visit the United States next month. The letter goes like  this: "I am waiting to meet you. At that time, we will analyze  world relations as well as our mutual relations. The purpose of  this is improve U.S.-India relations." One veteran leader  commented on it in these words, "This letter does not stand  anywhere when compared to President Reagan's warm letter to  Rajiv Gandhi."    Second, Talbott met with all leaders one by one. Mr. Rao  expressed India's concern over U.S. plans to supply F-16s to  Pakistan. However, Talbott's assurance was very restricted. He  said that he did not want to play the Pakistan card. In  addition, he criticized Dulles.    The hint about Kashmir was also very unclear. Robin Raphel  declares Kashmir to be a disputed region, but Talbott talks  about the Shimla agreement. The truth is the Washington is still  kicking the Kashmir issue around. One Indian observer commented  that the U.S. proposal is analogous to saying [in wrestling], "I  have pinned down and I am also pinned down." We should restrict  our program and Pakistan will get F-16s. This is not  negotiation; this is a joke.    In addition, Talbott expressed confidence about his trip to  Pakistan. This means that Washington and Islamabad have agreed  on some confidential pact. The special condition of this could  be that Pakistan has agreed to restrict its nuclear program. It  should be remembered here that the commander in chief of  Pakistani armed forces was purchasing weapons in the United  States during those days. All Talbott said was, "The United  States and Pakistan have laid the foundation stone for  progressing in the right direction."    One Pakistani spokesman said that their government will  consider any proposal that helps balance power between India and  Pakistan. However, these special issues can be different. This  way, Talbott has been successful in his lump deal. This means  that Pakistan will restrict its nuclear program in exchange for  receiving F-16 fighter planes. This will lead to U.S. pressure  on India to restrict its high technology, space, and nuclear  programs. Talbott denies that he is tying Kashmir to nuclear  non-proliferation. It is incorrect. As for Pakistan, it has  always viewed this issue within the framework of Kashmir and has  tied relationship with India to it. The United States knows that  it cannot change Pakistan's determination. It proposed the idea  of India and Pakistan forming a regional group to resolve their  problems. At the same time, they should limit their nuclear  weapons.    Still, it was clear to India. That is why Prime Minister  Narasimha Rao had told Talbott that India will not sign the NPT  [Nonproliferation Treaty]. It will not express its reaction to  U.S. supplying weapons to Pakistan because it is actively  helping the terrorists. Ambassador Siddartha Shankar Ray  commented, "How can it be logical for the United States to  increase India's defense-related worries and then pressure India  to reduce its defense forces?"    If there are so many disagreements between India and the  United States, why was not the non-proliferation issue given  much importance during Talbott's visit? If we look at it from  the U.S. perspective, we will learn that Talbott's goal was to  first target the nuclear weapons and then end the nuclear  program. We can say that this task is the most complicated after  the end of the Cold War.    The U.S. foreign policy can be viewed from U.S. economic  prosperity angle. Asia is the only path to its future  prosperity. Unfortunately, Clinton strategy is to "gain a lot  without much work" and all this without facing any danger. The  Asian leaders are opposing it because they find that bringing  Washington's trade here means Washington forcing its political  wishes on them.    There are two basic aspects of Clinton's Asia policy. First,  on 3 June he has to decide whether to keep the most favored  nation clause for China or not. Second is to implement the U.S.  law Super-301, which empowers the U.S. President to impose  restrictions on the nations that close their markets to U.S.  products. The target this time is Japan.    In other words, the U.S. administration has become alert. It  does not want to see another failure in the Indian  sub-continent. That is why it wants to impose limited  restrictions and not fight the whole war at once. It is  targeting India and Pakistan in this context.    It is adamant on the proposal related to nuclear  non-proliferation and weapons control on multi-national  agreement. He has recently increased the number of nations from  five to nine, because the idea of five nations was not  acceptable and it did not satisfy India. Therefore, it has been  suggested in the U.S. proposals that initial talks be held once  of twice a year on one issue and these talks can be started by  either the United States or Japan.    The defense in South Asia should be made the basic issue for  these talks. Each point should be discussed to attain the goal.  The U.S. proposal emphasizes raising the defense issues in South  Asia in these talks and pointing out the points of dissention  that cause these problems. There are provisions to impose  restrictions on the production of nuclear weapons. This task  will be taken care of by other associated nations.    It will be a good thing if the two countries agree on an  issue. This platform will monitor to see the rate of progress.  The basis for any decision is that all involved nations agree.    This agenda shows that the U.S. intentions are not  honorable.  India will oppose any step that is against it. Of course, Prime  Minister Narasimha Rao will discuss all these issues with  President Bill Clinton in Washington next month. The United  States definitely is very important for India, however, the fact  is that the United States is not always correct; other countries  are always wrong!    Therefore, New Delhi must be fully prepared and the Rajiv  Gandhi formula about NPT must be made clear once again. It said  that it must be accepted by all the nations and all must agree  to gradually get rid of their nuclear weapons by 2010. The U.S.  proposal that is in front of us is according to the U.S. and  Pakistani wishes; not to India's. The United States should deal  with India carefully. India can do a lot for the United States,  but the United States should also bend a little and try to  understand facts. Let us hope that Narasimha Rao during his trip  will be able to convince Clinton to follow Kennedy's footsteps  when dealing with India.</p>

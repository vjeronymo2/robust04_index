			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Long View: Rates on the turn It is now almost six months since UK short-term interest rates were controversially cut, amid disagreement between the Treasury and the Bank of England and in the immediate wake of the initial tightening of dollar rates by the US Federal Reserve. A good deal of economic recovery and growth has flowed under the bridge since, making an early rise in UK rates look much more likely, although there was only confusion in the money markets yesterday afternoon as the Bank apparently tried to distance itself from a sudden rise in Treasury bill rates. Any official rise confirmed at the beginning of next week - maybe of half a percentage point - would be the first after 15 consecutive cuts since the peak of the last interest rate cycle was reached at 15 per cent in 1989. No acceleration of inflation is yet visible: the latest underlying rate is no more than 2.4 per cent, and the upward pressures, when they arrive, are likely to prove modest. However, inflation can only be beaten from the front, not in arrears. The British economy is now growing quite fast - by 3.3 per cent in the second quarter, which on past form for this stage of the economic cycle is likely to be an underestimate by the official statisticians. In such a context this week's quarterly industrial trends survey from the CBI for July upset the markets by highlighting the ingrained inflationary bias in Britain's industrial economy. Capacity utilisation is already at historically high levels; investment intentions are quite subdued. Britain's manufacturing industry is today dominated by dogged survivors. Most of the expansionists and optimists went out of business years ago. The rest have cut capacity and slashed costs and have waited impatiently in their trenches for a revival in demand. They now plan to raise their prices and boost their profits - at least, that is the intention of a significant balance of companies surveyed by the CBI. The same message comes from a separate survey, showing a sharp rise in the purchasing managers' price index for July. There is little obvious sign of companies that intend to increase output and cut prices - outside Wapping, anyway. If this price-based commercial strategy works it will prove inflationary. A price-led recovery would surely drag up pay, currently growing at a fairly modest 3 3/4 per cent. Profits are already reaching a 30-year high as a proportion of national income. More likely, the strategy will not work but will lead straight to a more potent problem - a balance of payments crisis. This is because in an open economy foreign-made imports which are not having their prices raised will increase their market share - and anyway, domestic supply will prove inadequate. A strong cyclical surge in profits is built into the expectations of the stock market. The renewed weakness of the gilt-edged market this week, when the Bank of England's 300th birthday celebrations on Wednesday were slightly dampened by the disappointing response to that day's gilt auction, has undermined the valuation of equities. For instance, the yield ratio between long-dated gilts and equities has widened to nearly 2.3, which is looking stretched. Moreover the real yield gap between equities and index-linked gilts, which normally wobbles around a positive 0.5 per cent, is slightly negative. The last time this happened was in 1987, when the reverse gap reached a full percentage point shortly before the stock market crashed in October that year. In early 1987 expectations of growth in profits and dividends were very high  -justifiably. Dividends grew by 15 per cent that year. Even so, the bubble of overvaluation soon burst. This time analysts appear to be expecting profits growth of at least 15 per cent both this year and next, with year-on-year dividend growth rising from its current 7 per cent to maybe 9 per cent - a healthy advance in real terms, assuming inflation stays low. So looking two years ahead the All-Share Index could be yielding a prospective 4.5 per cent, in which case the challenge of index-linked gilts returning 3.9 per cent real, as they now do, would look quite weak. But the tension between the inflationary enthusiasm of the securities markets and the anti-inflationary zeal of the authorities is becoming charged. Implied inflation in the gilt market is now more than 4 1/2 per cent. This week the Bank of England offered straight 16-year fixed-coupon paper, which was what the market was supposedly waiting for. But the issue barely got away and bidders were immediately showing a 1.5 per cent loss. One problem may be a shortage of domestic buying power, at a time when the foreigners are sitting on their hands. Life assurance companies, the biggest domestic buyers of gilts, have seen their new business fall away - by 20 per cent in the first half for the Prudential, by 17 per cent for Legal &amp; General. Pension funds have very little cash flow, and can only buy gilts by selling equities. But the more fundamental point is that this is a bad time in the cycle for bonds. When equity dividend expectations are so high a yield of even 8 1/2 per cent-plus on gilts seems tame. The market seems quickly to have forgotten the scare over Stephen Dorrell and his hints at extra taxes on dividends; Dorrell has anyway been reshuffled to a safe distance from the Treasury. At some point, perhaps imminently, the Bank of England may have to seize the initiative and put short-term rates up. It has to cool down economic growth to a pace - under 3 per cent - which the capacity-constrained UK economy can handle. It will have to try to convince industry - though this will take years - that rapid, sustainable growth can only come through raising productivity and building more factories, not from jacking up margins. The UK equity market, however, has jumped on to a time loop back to the 1980s, and is thoroughly enjoying the ride. But that time machine could generate higher interest rates too.</p>

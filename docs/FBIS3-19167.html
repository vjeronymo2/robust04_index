			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hakan Akpinar and Kadir Ercan: "They Went To </F> Appeal to Mitterrand"]    [Text] Ankara--The Democracy Party [DEP] has launched a  diplomatic initiative in Europe after six of its deputies,  including party leader Hatip Dicle, were placed in custody.  Sedat Yurtdas and Mehdi Zana, DEP deputies from Diyarbakir,  left Turkey for France for that purpose yesterday. They will  appeal to the international organizations, including the Human  Rights Court [as published], to launch initiatives to have the  detained deputies released and their legislative immunity  returned.    It has been ascertained that the French Government has been  informed on Yurtdas' and Zana's visit to Europe to appeal to  President Mitterrand and Mrs. Mitterrand to take action to  support them.    The officials will begin to interrogate Hatip Dicle, Orhan  Dogan, Ahmet Turk, Leyla Zana, Sirri Sakik, and Mahmut Alinak  today. Dicle and Dogan have been in custody for six days and  Turk, Zana, Sakik, and Alinak have been held in custody for five  days. They will be interrogated by a group of officials under  Nusret Demirel, chief prosecutor of the State Security Court.  The group is made up of Major Ulku Coskun, Kemal Ayhan, and  Talat Salk, who are prosecutors affiliated with the State  Security Court. The deputies will be isolated in separate rooms  during the interrogation.    Meanwhile, an anonymous person called the Directorate  General  of Police on behalf of the Kurdish Workers Party yesterday and  warned that the PKK will assassinate several officials if the  deputies are not released from custody. A special operations  team armed with M-16 automatic rifles was instructed to guard  the building that houses the antiterror department after the  call was received. The DEP deputies are being held in that  department.</p>

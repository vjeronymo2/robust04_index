			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TATTERED QUEEN OF THE '20S;  </P> <P> REDEVELOPMENT: A RUNDOWN DREAM HOUSE BUILT BY SAN CLEMENTE'S FOUNDER MAY BECOME  A RENOVATION CENTERPIECE.  </P> <P> Casa Romantica, the 20-room home of San Clemente's founder, Ole Hanson, once  was a plush mansion tended by servants and frequented by movie stars.  </P> <P> Today it is a tattered remnant of that gathering place for the glamorous in the  1920s. Its cracked ceilings are in danger of collapsing under rain, the  plumbing and wiring are in desperate need of repair, and the sandy bluff under  the home is crumbling from years of erosion.  </P> <P> The estimated cost of fixing the mess is $350,000, according to a recent city  study.  </P> <P> In an effort to save Hanson's dream home from natural destruction, the San  Clemente Redevelopment Agency this year completed a $2.5-million deal to buy  the house, the bluff it sits on and a parking lot below at the San Clemente  Pier.  </P> <P> This total five-acre site, city officials hope, will be the centerpiece for the  ongoing renovation of the Pier Bowl area, the title given to the shops and  restaurants on the street fronting the pier and the city's most heavily  populated stretch of beach.  </P> <P> "I think the Casa Romantica purchase is an outgrowth of an ongoing effort of  the Pier Bowl upgrade," Councilman Scott Diehl said. "It will be the capstone  to the pier development.  </P> <P> A developer selected by city officials is designing a commercial project for  the site that would include a hotel, restaurant and multilevel parking lot and  would preserve the home. Those plans are expected to be unveiled sometime next  month.  </P> <P> Longtime San Clemente resident Dorothy Fuller, 64, who lived in Casa Romantica  for 14 summers after Hanson lost it during the Depression, said she would "love  to see this place be the symbol of the American dream of free enterprise. It  shows what a young man can do by following his dreams."  </P> <P> Hanson single-handedly founded the city of San Clemente in 1928 as a "Spanish  Village by the Sea," characterized by Mediterranean-style white, stucco homes  topped with red tile roofs dotting the rolling hills above the secluded beach.  Its first-year population was 650.  </P> <P> Entering into a partnership with his longtime business associate, oil magnate  Henry Hamilton Cotton, Hanson built 300 stucco houses between 1925 and 1929,  many of which are still standing despite San Clemente's post-World War II  growth. Cotton's 70-acre estate on the southernmost end of the city later  served as the Western White House under former President Richard M. Nixon.  </P> <P> In a recent tour of Casa Romantica, the 11th of Hanson's 13 children, Eugene  (Bunny) Hanson, 74, recalled the elegant parties hosted by his parents,  featuring screen stars Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, Mary Astor and Richard  Dix.  </P> <P> "They used the solarium for dancing," he said. "It was the thing to do to have  these parties. We were the entertainment capital then."  </P> <P> Eugene Hanson, who remembered when the family moved into the house in 1926,  spun tales of jilted lovers and of gangsters running bootleg liquor through  town. He laughed at the memory of annoying famed violinist Jascha Heifetz, the  neighbor, by starting a sputtering power lawn mower every time Heifetz began to  practice.  </P> <P> Charlie Ashbaugh, a 17-year San Clemente resident who has studied the town  founder's life, said, "I never heard of Ole Hanson until I moved here, and now  I feel like I know everything about him."  </P> <P> Ashbaugh, who is president of the San Clemente Historical Society, and his  supporters are lobbying city officials to include some museum space in the  redevelopment project.  </P> <P> Ashbaugh has made it his personal mission for the last four years to find and  collect furnishings that once were part of Casa Romantica, saving them in a  self-storage unit.  </P> <P> The list includes the desk that graced Hanson's octagon-shaped office, a huge  Spanish mosaic taken from a patio wall and other pieces gleaned from the widows  of Hanson's sons.  </P> <P> Hanson, who once was a millionaire three times over, died penniless in 1940 at  age 66, Fuller said. The Bank of America repossessed the home in 1932. Although  Hanson built it for $170,000, it was purchased by Cotton's chauffeur in the  1940s for $8,000. In 1960, George Welsh of San Clemente bought the house for  $120,000. He sold it this year to the city.  </P> <P> For the last five years, Casa Romantica has been leased for $10,000 a year to  Maureen Capielo, who stages weddings and corporate parties in the huge living  and dining rooms.  </P> <P> "I'd love to put $10,000 or more into this place and fix some of the things  wrong with it," Capielo said, adding that she is also interested in buying the  home if the redevelopment plans fail.  </P></p>

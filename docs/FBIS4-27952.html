			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Sword-brandishing of Nuclearmaniac" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam fascist  clique a few days ago brutally suppressed inhabitants in Uljin  County in a demonstration against the building of a nuclear  waste dump, leaving some 20 people mortally wounded and  arresting 24 on the scene.    NODONG SINMUN today says this brutality can be committed  only  by such fascist tyrants as the Kim Yong-sam group whose mode of  existence is sword-brandishing.    To maintain one's existence and protect living environments  pertains to the intrinsic independent rights of human beings,  the analyst says, and continues:    The exercise of these rights can never be criminalized or  suppressed in any case. Nevertheless, the puppets are brutally  suppressing the people's righteous struggle for existence at the  point of the bayonet. This is really a fascist outrage fully  revealing the ferocity of the "civilian" dictatorship.    Their suppression of people opposing the building of a  nuclear waste dump is a brigandish act for forcing them to  reconcile themselves to nuclear harm.    Unpardonable is the crime of the Kim Yong-sam group which is  going to build a nuclear waste dump and inflict irrevocable  nuclear disasters upon the people, after converting South Korea  into a nuclear base of the United States.</p>

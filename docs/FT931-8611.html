			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Boots sets date for US launch of heart drug BOOTS, the retail and pharmaceutical group, said yesterday that it would launch Manoplax, its new drug for congestive heart failure, in the US on March 29. The company's shares rose 6p to 491p. The drug, which is expected to be a significant profit earner for Boots' pharmaceutical business through the 1990s, won approval from the US Food and Drug Administration on December 31. It was launched in the UK last September, after gaining a product licence in August. In November Boots said that marketing costs relating to Manoplax had reached Pounds 8m in the first half of the financial year to September 30, and would continue at or above that level in the second half. Boots agreed a co-marketing deal with Parke-Davis, part of Warner-Lambert, the US drug company, in July 1991 which will cover Manoplax in the US. About 3m Americans suffer from congestive heart failure and 400,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. Under the FDA approval, Manoplax is indicated in patients not responding to or unable to tolerate other treatments. It is hoped that later Manoplax will be used more widely. The drug is manufactured in the UK but packaged in the US. Boots is already building up supplies to the US market. It has a fairly limited use at present The price of the drug in the US will be in line with the UK price, at Dollars 60 (Pounds 42) for 30 50mg or 75mg tablets and Dollars 120 for 60 100mg tablets.</p>

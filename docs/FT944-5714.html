			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Companies 'cut cash for Tories' The Conservative party has suffered a big fall in cash gifts from companies, says a survey published today by the Labour Research Department, a research organisation funded mainly by unions. Labour Research could find only 168 companies that had made donations in the year to March to the Conservative party, the lowest such figure produced by the research group. The companies in the survey donated a total of Pounds 2.51m, which is the third lowest sum reported by the annual survey since 1979. The total was down substantially from Pounds 7.76m in 1991 - the last comparable year because gifts for 1992 and 1993 were boosted by the closeness of the last general election. The annual survey by Labour Research is considered a good guide to how much companies are donating to the Conservatives, although it cannot be regarded as completely authoritative. It covers about 5,000 UK companies and is thought to capture most of the large donations made by big public companies. The survey does not include cash donated by individuals or amounts donated by companies not listed in the UK. The Pounds 2.51m traced by Labour Research accounts for just over a quarter of the Pounds 9.37m which was donated to the Conservatives in the year to the end of March from companies and individuals. In the past two years several big companies have cut back or stopped donations either because of reductions in profits during the recession or because they have not wanted to be seen publicly to be diverting large sums to the Conservatives. Among the companies cutting back have been food manufacturer United Biscuits, construction company Taylor Woodrow, the Argyll supermarket group and drinks company Allied Domecq.</p>

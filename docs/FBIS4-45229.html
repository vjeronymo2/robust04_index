			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Ndivanga] </F>   [Excerpts] Six people were arrested at Kongolo in Caprivi  in possession of 25,823 Mandrax tablets with a street value of  Namibian dollars 645,000 in the biggest Mandrax bust in Namibia.  The six included two Namibian citizens, Edwin Modibedi and  Regina Mojakie, and four South Africans Pretty Kondlo, Beauty  Jacobs, Charles Pietersen and Immanuel Murrulhna. [passage  omitted]    The six had passed undetected through a border post with  Zambia.    Nampol [Namibian Police] spokesperson Edwin Kanguatjivi  yesterday told reporters that the six were arrested by members  of the Namibian Police Drug Enforcement Bureau with the  co-operation of the Zambian police. [passage omitted]    Asked whether drug traffickers considered Namibian security  poor, Kanguatjivi said Namibia happened to be on a recognised  drug route.    Nampol's Inspector Louis Mensah said the tablets were  manufactured in Bombay, India, and, according to information,  also in Zambia. He said the drug was banned in South Africa in  1976. Previously it was prescribed as sleeping tablets.</p>

			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> DESPITE FATIGUE, TRAIL BLAZERS WIN  </P> <P> The Portland Trail Blazers ignored fatigue and outlasted the Utah Jazz, 101-97,  Sunday night at Portland.  </P> <P> While the Jazz spent Saturday night resting in Portland, the Trail Blazers  battled through three overtimes at Seattle before pulling out a 130-124  victory.  </P> <P> They arrived home early Sunday morning.  </P> <P> With players such as Karl Malone and gigantic Mark Eaton, Utah is one of the  NBA's more physical teams.  </P> <P> But the Trail Blazers are showing signs of greatness. While improving the best  record in the league to 14-1, they ended the Jazz's five-game winning streak.  </P> <P> Buck Williams, who played only 41 minutes of the 63 minutes in the triple  overtime, had a season-high 23 points and 11 rebounds and Terry Porter, who had  38 points at Seattle, sank a three-pointer in the last minute to clinch the  win.  </P> <P> The Trail Blazers showed signs of fatigue and they had to overcome a  magnificent game by Karl Malone, who had 36 points and 16 rebounds.  </P> <P> The Blazers led most of the game, but seldom by more than four or five points.  Porter scored 10 of his 17 points in the fourth quarter, getting a basket both  times after Utah cut the lead to a point.  </P> <P> Indiana 107, Milwaukee 103 -- The Pacers seemed headed for their fifth  consecutive defeat when they fell behind the Bucks, 26-12 in the first eight  minutes at Indianapolis.  </P> <P> But Chuck Person and Reggie Miller rallied the Pacers and by halftime, they  held a 58-46 lead.  </P> <P> The next surge was the Bucks and they pulled ahead 102-101. But in the last 20  seconds both Person and Miller sank two free throws to give the Pacers the  victory. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Moscow troops in office raid Russia's most prominent private businessman accused President Boris Yeltsin's personal guards at the weekend of being involved in a bizarre raid on his company's offices on Friday night, John Thornhill writes from Moscow. A large detachment of heavily armed troops, wearing camouflage uniforms and balaclavas, surrounded the offices of Mr Vladimir Gusinsky's Most group, refusing to identify themselves. They took away several Most security guards and drivers in unmarked cars. No official reason was given but the Itar-Tass news agency, quoting 'authoritative sources', suggested its aim was to confiscate documents relating to Most Bank's alleged involvement in the rouble crash of October 11. The president's press secretary said Mr Yeltsin had launched an inquiry into the raid but would not confirm whether his guards had been involved.</p>

			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Construction Contracts: Wimpey to face green roof task A dramatic underground multi-purpose hall, topped with turf and shrubs, forms part of two design and build contracts for Netherhall Education Association won by Wimpey Construction London. The schemes, worth a total of Pounds 5.3m, are to develop and refurbish a students' hall of residence and a catering training centre in Hampstead, north London. They also involve the demolition of three buildings, and replacing them with two hostels and seminar centres, together with a new teaching wing. Extensions will be added to two existing buildings, Lakefield Centre and Netherhall House. Several unusual features have been required because the college is sited in a conservation area. By far the most distinctive is the location of a multi-purpose hall, which will be built underground and topped with a landscaped 'green roof'. That will involve excavating some 2,000 cubic metres of earth to house the two storey building. The new work will also blend in with existing premises as a result of careful selection of materials. Original features of a Victorian building, such as the roof finials and facing decorative brick work, will be replicated and used in construction of the new premises. When fully operational by the end of 1994, Wimpey will have rebuilt or refurbished about 5,000 sq metres of the colleges. The contracts will finish in two stages with the chief construction work completed in time for occupation next summer. The second phase, the refurbishment part of the contract, will be ready by Christmas 1994.</p>

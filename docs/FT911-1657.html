			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Observer: Messy affair WPP's Martin Sorrell has done valiant behind the scenes work in the run-up to the boardroom coup at the Budgens supermarket chain, where he was the only non-executive director. It was apparently his idea to bring in Charterhouse to give the Budgens board independent advice, and WPP's Hill and Knowlton public relations team was imported to add professionalism to a messy affair. True, Sorrell's role in extending the contracts of the top Budgens executives after some abysmal results was surprising. But generally he seems to have behaved as a model, if not holier-than-thou, non-executive director. It is all a bit ironic. Sorrell, like erstwhile friend John Fletcher, is an entrepreneurial Harvard MBA once able to persuade banks to lend him loads of money for takeovers. Now Fletcher has been given the boot, will the institutions turn their gaze on WPP? Its shares have collapsed; the millenium may be over before it pays its next ordinary dividend; and its board badly needs some new non-executive directors. Perhaps the Budgens affair was Sorrell's dress-rehearsal. Perhaps, too, more will be revealed in WPP's accounts due at the month end.</p>

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / MacGregor rules out toll booths MR JOHN MacGregor, the transport secretary, last night promised that motorists in the UK would never face the prospect of paying road charges at Continental-style toll booths. He warned, however, that ways had to be found of charging for the use of motorways to fund completion of the Pounds 19bn building programme. Mr MacGregor was speaking as he arrived in Oslo for a two-day tour of road charging systems in Scandinavia. He said he wanted to stimulate a public debate on the possibility of charging people for the use of the roads but ruled out the idea of Continental toll booths because they would slow down traffic and take up too much land. He said the idea of using charges to tackle congestion in London and other built-up areas posed problems because the necessary technology was not ready and decisions had to be taken on issues such as who should be exempted. He would not decide on urban road pricing until early 1995, after completion of a Department of Transport study, but Britain had to discuss motorway charges much earlier than that because public-sector finance alone would not fund completion of the road programme by the end of the decade. One option would be to see whether existing electronic technology would provide an answer. Another would be a system similar to that of Switzerland, where drivers pay SFr30 (Pounds 13.50) for an annual licence to use motorways. Mr MacGregor said the paper setting out the options would appear in four to six weeks.</p>

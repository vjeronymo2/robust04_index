			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 19 (KCNA) -- MINJU CHOSON today  carries a commentary captioned "Anti-Reunification Act of  Civilian Fascist".    The Kim Yong-sam group Monday arrested a student of Chonpuk  National University Ho Hyon-chun, former vice-chairman of the  South side headquarters of the Pan-National Alliance of Youth  and Students for the Country's Reunification, on the charge of  the "violation of the National Security Law". He was put on the  "want list" for his involvement in the pan-national rally last  year. Branding this as another fascist offensive against the  pro-reunification patriotic forces and an anti-reunification  crime, the analyst says:    It was out of the patriotic desire to bring earlier national  reunification, the nation's wish, that the students in the North  and the South last year discussed the matters of opening a grand  reunification festival of students, holding talks at Panmunjom  and confirming the reunification formula.    Unable to sit at one place, they debated on matters  regarding  reunification in the form of telephone dialogue. It was a  patriotic deed to contribute to the noble cause of national  reunification, as befits the standard-bearers of the country's  reunification. It can never be a target of suppression.    But, taking issue with it, the Kim Yong-sam group blocked  the  students' reunification festival and arrested many patriotic  people and, as if it were not enough, arrested one more student  this time. This is a never-to-be- condoned act.    The "civilian regime" of Kim Yong-sam group is no more than  a  veil, which is not different from the former military fascist  regimes at all.    There is nothing to expect from the present regime.</p>

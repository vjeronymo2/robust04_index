			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Collecting: A warm welcome for a patchy revival - A whole raft of fairs is transforming the selling methods of the antiques trade indeed, throughout the UK - need reasons to open their shops these days. Trade has been poor for almost three years and the arrival of the busy autumn season with its rush of auctions, fairs and exhibitions does not by itself promise any improvement. If, however, business remains patchy, with some dealers welcoming back long-lost clients while others wonder if the struggle is worth it, at least there is a consensus that the worst is over. The economic revival, on which the profitability of the antiques trade depends, might still be wobbly and continental dealers, who enthusiastically filled the gap left by the disappearance of American buyers, are sure to be less active as their national economies falter. But few imagine a deterioration and many expect a better year. The first sprouts of a revival are emerging through the permafrost. Cork Street, the high street of modern art in London's West End, welcomes two new dealers: Beaux Art, which is already well established in Bath, and David Messum who is renting The Gallery, at No 28, until Christmas. For Messum, this is a remarkably quick comeback after being liquidated by his bank last year. It discovered he was the best person to sell his stock of British Impressionists and he is now concentrating on the lower price range. Prices this autumn will be no higher than a year ago. This is certainly true of pictures and antique silver. Good furniture, especially country furniture, has held its value although Georgian brown furniture is marking time. Another dealer to catch the new mood is Alastair Sampson. He is holding a sale - a clear-out of his Brompton Road stock in west London - in preparation for a move into smaller premises in Mayfair. Some ceramics are going at cost, or less. Also available in London at the moment (at Connaught Brown in Albemarle Street until October 7) is the Affordable Art exhibition to which many leading galleries have assigned work priced between Pounds 100 and Pounds 2,500. Trading through small shops might not be the future for all in the antique trade, though. Lord Derwent, chairman of the London and Provincial Antique Dealers' Association (Lapada), lists the problems facing his members on top of the collapse of the market: the business tax, fire regulations and other bureaucratic red tape, burglaries, and ram raiders. He is also concerned that, in the short term, changes in European Community regulations - which have imposed value-added tax on some imported goods and limited the traditionally free market in antiques enjoyed by the UK - will allow France to reassert its historical role in the art trade. Derwent believes that any substantial revival in turnover waits on a recovery in the housing market. Not only would this help art-lovers to feel richer - it would also quicken the rate of house removals, a potent reason to buy more antique tables, chairs, decorative furnishings and the rest. More and more dealers, under pressure from bank managers to reduce their overdrafts, are closing their shops and operating from home, using the many antique fairs to meet new customers, acquire stock and catch up with trade news. The fair season never ends, but last weekend marked the start of the autumn rush with the successful specialist fair of 20th century British art at the Royal College of Art, which saw established names like Elisabeth Frink and Graham Sutherland selling well. On October 12 comes the third show organised by Lapada to promote the stock of its members. It, too, will be held at the Royal College and the 60-plus dealers will be working to the theme 'The human form in art.' All the objects are vetted and range in price from Pounds 50 to Pounds 500,000. Then comes the November Olympia (to be followed in February by another fair at the mammoth west London venue, this time with no date restrictions on the items for sale); the old City of London Fair, formerly at the Barbican but now moved to the Business Design Centre at London's Angel from October 28; and the eagerly awaited Harrods Fair, which aims to provide international collectors with a wonderful excuse for Christmas shopping. These are just the most prominent of a whole raft of fairs which are transforming the selling methods of the antiques trade. Even the dealers wedded to their premises see less of them these days: they are out hunting for stock. Along with hesitant buyers, the main problem is the shortage of quality antiques; potential sellers are waiting for prices to rise. Even the losses of the Lloyd's Names, many of whom were keen collectors of antiques, have released few decent items on to the market. But the problems at Lloyd's have undoubtedly reduced buying demand, especially in regions like Sussex, although one dealer there is attempting a new approach to marketing in a cold climate. Michael Keehan, of Michael Norman Antiques, has just opened the largest retail antiques furniture store in the country, if not the world. He has acquired the freehold of the former Maples store in Hove, next door to Brighton, and is displaying up to 5,000 pieces of 18th and early-19th century furniture with a total value approaching Pounds 10m. Keehan is hoping for an annual turnover of Pounds 4m. The auction houses have few headline-making sales. Christie's has potentially the top price in London before Christmas with a Gainsborough landscape of peasants going to market - being sold, amid some controversy, by Royal Holloway College - on December 10 and expected to make Pounds 4m. The steady dispersal of the national heritage continues with Lord Radnor's decision to sell three 16th century bronzes by Giambologna, the Florentine master, three days earlier. He hopes to raise more than Pounds 750,000 to secure his family home, Longford Castle in Wiltshire. Sotheby's sales include a collection of many hundreds of botanical and ornithological drawings amassed by a Major-General Farquhar in Malacca around 1815; these are being sold by the Royal Asiatic Society, which should be Pounds 500,000 richer on October 20. Some members, however, oppose the sell-off strongly. In recent months, the dealers have been asserting themselves again, fighting against the dominance of the salerooms. Their trade bodies, like Lapada and the British Antiques Dealers Association (Bada), have become more effective. This autumn, Bada continues its 75th anniversary celebrations with a barrage of exhibitions by members. These range from 18th century objects of vertu at Halcyon Days (in Brook Street W1) from October 12, to The Monarchy in portrait miniatures at DS Lavender (Grafton Street W1) from October 25. Dealers in the Cotswolds alone have put together 14 exhibitions for the autumn. In addition, there are such regular autumn exhibitions as the annual October show of marine paintings at the Royal Exchange Gallery in London EC3. Indeed, this gallery sums up the trade. Business had been quiet until August; then, it took off, fuelled by the rise in the stock exchange. The exchange depends on improving economic indicators for its recovery. If these look better over the next month or two, then the antiques trade will have a good year. It is as simple as that.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Continental sales help Powerscreen to Pounds 18.8m SALES GROWTH in continental Europe helped Powerscreen International, the Northern Ireland-based maker of screening and crushing equipment, to increase annual pre-tax profit to Pounds 18.8m. The advance, from a restated Pounds 15.8m, followed a 22 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 88.1m (Pounds 72.3m) in the year to March 31. It was the company's fifth year of profits growth. Mr Shay McKeown, chief executive, said the Continent's share of sales had risen from less than 12 per cent in 1988 to 28 per cent last year. Germany had been a strong market, particularly for the recycling of material to lay as a base for new infrastructure. North America still accounted for the largest proportion of sales with 39 per cent. Guzzler, which makes truck-mounted suction equipment for waste removal, was in for a full year instead of eight months. Under Powerscreen's ownership it had broken into the municipal market for cleaning sewers. Two more recent acquisitions, Finlay and Matbro in the UK, contributed 12 per cent of sales and Pounds 300,000 to pre-tax profit, which was better than expected. Product development had been another important part of the group's growth. The Powerscreen Commander, which gives a three-way split in the screening of aggregates, had built up to 17 per cent of group sales since its 1988 launch. Mr Barry Cosgrove, finance director, said new subsidiaries brought in about Pounds 7.5m debt. Nevertheless, the group finished the year with a small amount of cash in hand, compared with Pounds 2m net cash in March 1991. The previous year's figures were restated because it had been decided to write off research and development spending in the year it was incurred instead of capitalising it. With extra shares in issue and a higher tax charge, fully diluted earnings per share rose 9 per cent to 16.1p (14.8p). A final dividend of 4.3p makes a total of 6p (5.55p). COMMENT Powerscreen has proved to be one of the best recession-beating stories in the engineering sector. Years of work on overseas markets have built up non-UK sales to 73 per cent. Its products can handle a variety of materials, from rubble and coal to sewage, and its specialisation in mobile machines has proved difficult to compete with. Where it has been affected by slackening demand, it has limited the damage. Machine volumes at Powerscreen and Brown Lenox, its two biggest subsidiaries, were 2-3 per cent down last year, whereas it is estimated the building and construction market in western Europe and North America fell 15 per cent. Mr McKeown reckons that these two offshoots will provide the main sources of growth this year, particularly as the US recovers. Pre-tax profit is forecast to top Pounds 22m - giving a prospective multiple of 15, in line with the market. This represents a substantial re-rating as the shares have doubled in value to 282p since the beginning of last year. Nevertheless, it can still be argued that the stock deserves to trade at a premium.</p>

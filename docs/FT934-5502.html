			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Election lawsuit dropped The Democratic party in New Jersey has dropped its lawsuit seeking to invalidate this month's election to pick the state's new governor, in which Mrs Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican candidate, defeated incumbent Governor Jim Florio, reports George Graham from Washington. The suit had been filed after Mr Ed Rollins, Mrs Whitman's campaign manager, said the campaign had paid black preachers to stop their congregations from voting. Mr Rollins later said under oath that he had made this up to taunt Mr Florio's campaign manager. Democratic leaders concluded they could not prove the Republicans paid to suppress black votes.</p>

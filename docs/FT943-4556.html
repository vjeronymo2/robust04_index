			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Fresh meat from Europe's stable: The motives behind controversial French and German suggestions for developing the EU 'All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others' - George Orwell, Animal Farm, 1945 Since its inception, the European Union has rejected the notion of first- and second-class citizens. Talk of inner circles or exclusive clubs has always been taboo, despite stark differences in wealth, size and population among the member states. Now Germany, the biggest and most powerful member of the club, has broken ranks. Last week, the ruling Christian Democrat party and its CSU coalition partners came out in favour of a Franco-German-led 'hard core' of five nations committed to faster integration. The paper, echoing similar thinking within the French government, ended an uneasy truce over the pace and scope of integration which has prevailed since last November's ratification of the Maastricht treaty. Whether by accident or design, the Germans have triggered a debate on the issue at the heart of the EU's inter-governmental conference in 1996 to review Maastricht: how can the Union preserve its integrated structure while embracing an ever-increasing number of member states, notably the former communist countries of central and eastern Europe? Most member states would prefer not to peep into this Pandora's box. Organising a European Union of 20 to 25 member states will require an overhaul of EU institutions and procedures, which could jeopardise the delicate balance of national interests that has ensured political stability in western Europe for more than a generation. In an expanded Union, tiny Luxembourg (population 450,000) could not reckon on preserving its disproportionate voting power in EU decision-making. The 'Club Med' countries of Greece, Spain and Portugal risk reductions in regional aid to accommodate the east Europeans. 'All these changes awaken fears among smaller and poorer states of being marginalised,' says a Commission official. For the UK government, the contents of the CDU/CSU paper threaten to reopen civil war in the ruling Conservative party. Mr John Major, prime minister, papered over divisions during his speech in Leiden yesterday, which called for new, flexible methods of co-operation while rejecting the idea of a two-tiered Europe. But he remains trapped between Euro-philes, worried about Britain being left in Europe's slow lane, and Euro-sceptics, resolutely opposed to further dilutions of national sovereignty. This week's diplomatic storm surrounding the CDU/CSU 'discussion paper' would have passed quickly had its authors avoided naming countries which they deemed worthy of membership of a hard core: the assumption that not all countries would enter tighter economic and monetary union on schedule by 1997-99 is hardly new. Indeed, the Maastricht treaty explicitly provides for a 'multi-speed' formation. But by excluding Italy (a founder member of the European Community in 1957) as well as Spain and the UK, the German paper pre-empted a future decision on which countries will qualify for Emu and caused a needless slight. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's explanation that the CDU/CSU paper was not official government policy served only to fuel questions about the timing and motives behind it. Some observers viewed the paper as floating a trial balloon staking out the German position ahead of 1996; others saw it as a pre-emptive warning to the British and the Danes, the 'semi-detached' members of the Union, who have long sought to temper enthusiasm on the continent for faster, deeper integration. Both views may overlook narrower German calculations linked to next month's general election. Mr Wolfgang Schauble, second only to Mr Kohl in the CDU hierarchy, and Mr Karl Lamers, the CDU's chief foreign affairs spokesman, launched the paper in the apparent hope that it would prevent the party's more conservative supporters defecting to fringe German nationalist parties. Significantly, the CSU came on board, despite the misgivings of Mr Edmund Stoiber, the CSU's Bavarian prime minister and avowed Euro-sceptic. Yet it is also clear that Mr Kohl and his closest advisers are convinced that the time is ripe for an open debate about the future of European integration and Germany's place in it. Mr Kohl remains determined to avoid a repeat of the Maastricht experience, when Europe's policymaking elite lost touch with the public. The paper's implicit message is that a frank exchange must take place with France, Germany's most important ally. In blunt terms, it points to differences on economic policy, including competition law, the objectives of the common agricultural policy, industrial policy and trade. The paper says that, if Germany puts forward plans for deeper political integration, France must reciprocate with 'equally clear and unequivocal decisions'. 'France must agree to a common European foreign policy, not just continue with a French foreign policy,' says a German official in Brussels. In a striking passage, the authors argue that France's 'basic' commitment to deeper integration remains indisputable; but they proceed to fret about French attachment to the nation state. 'The notion of the unsurrendable sovereignty of the 'Etat nation' still carries weight, although this sovereignty has long since become an empty shell.' The dilemma Germany and France face is how to preserve their alliance while simultaneously widening EU membership to eastern Europe. As the CDU/CSU paper implicitly acknowledges, enlargement serves Germany's economic and geographical interests; but it also risks diluting France's political leadership role in the Union. France was a reluctant convert to the present enlargement of the Union to encompass Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway - partly because it appeared to expand Germany's sphere of influence and tilt the Union northwards. A senior Commission official predicts that the French will come round to enlargement. Yet he warns that the Union will tilt even further east: 'The first round of enlargement will be Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia, but the second round will come soon after. That means Slovenia, the Baltic states and, if the war in Yugoslavia comes to an end, maybe Croatia.' This week, Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, perhaps with an eye on next spring's presidential election in France, gave an indication of his country's position on future patterns of European integration. In his view, Europe could organise along the lines of three concentric circles. France and Germany would head an inner core; other EU members wishing to travel more slowly could join a second circle; while the east Europeans would be consigned to an outer ring reflecting their backward economies. Crucially, Mr Balladur avoided naming which countries would form the hard core, or how his version of 'variable geometry' would operate in practice. In fact, 'variable geometry' is a highly complex subject upon which the best technocratic and legal minds in Europe have only just started to reflect. The German plan for an inner core, Mr Balladur's remarks and Mr Major's speech yesterday all offered different patterns of integration. The difficulty is that variable geometry can mean different things. In rough terms, there are three options: Variable speed Europe. Most experts argue that there is nothing wrong with countries moving at a different pace towards common objectives. Britain was involved in the creation of the European Monetary System, but only joined the European exchange rate mechanism several years later. Similarly, less developed economies such as Greece and Portugal are allowed 'derogations' or transition periods for single market legislation in banking and insurance. Europe a la carte. The consensus is that complete freedom of choice to accept or reject core obligations, such as the common agricultural policy or a common competition policy, would undermine the Union beyond repair. It would conflict with the treaty of Rome, unravel the single European market, and destroy the single institutional framework embracing the European Commission, the European Court and the Council of Ministers. Variable geometry. This option lies somewhere between the two above options. It would acknowledge that some member states have different interests, but flexibility would have limits. Variable geometry would be subject to agreement by all other member states. In practice, variable geometry already exists. Britain does not take part in the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty. Denmark has special protection against foreigners buying second homes. Ireland is not a member of the West European Union, the EU's emerging defence arm. France is a member of Nato, but is not a member of the alliance's integrated command. The challenge is how to apply variable geometry in an expanded Union, and how to adapt it to deal with the economic and budgetary problems posed by the entry of the east Europeans. 'The paradox is between what you want politically on the one hand, and what is mathematically sustainable on the other,' says Mr Hans Van den Broek, EU commissioner for external political affairs. The attractions of variable geometry are immense: able and willing states could press ahead according to their own pace, while others would retain the freedom to stay behind or catch up later. It could also allow the east Europeans generous transition periods in which to prepare for full EU membership. Yet the risks are also considerable if the variable geometry grants too much latitude. A senior EU official points out Britain may not subscribe to the social chapter, but it is bound by social policy provisions in successive European treaties: 'The social protocol (in Maastricht) is only a small part of the whole.' Similarly, there are big risks in allowing member states to opt out of EU decisions. Under a 1971 European Court ruling, where the Union has been given 'competence', or responsibility, in areas covering the internal market, it extends automatically to international negotiations. Hence a decision to allow 10 members of a 25-member Union to opt out of legislation covering air quality would create a legal and political minefield. 'The Japanese and Americans would rightly ask who the EU was representing,' says one legal official. The issue of whether the EU - through the Commission - has a distinct legal personality in matters such as trade has led to friction with France. Arguments over individual rights and collective responsibilities are equally important in the area of foreign and security policy, where full freedom to oppose decisions would paralyse the Union. Many observers believe that the answer to these conundrums lies in constructing a minimum set of rules and obligations to which all member states could subscribe, perhaps in a new Euro-constitution. Franco-German thinking appears to be proceeding on these lines, coupled with a stricter definition of Union-wide competences and matters reserved for the nation states. Yet all these attempts to resolve disputes over the shape of Europe ignore the present political constraints on member states and the fragile state of public opinion. Moreover, the bargains necessary for a comprehensive agreement have barely been identified, let alone negotiated among the existing and future member states. Thus France has yet to signal the degree to which it will commit itself to political union in return for the prize of a single European currency. Despite Mr Major's speech yesterday, Britain has yet to reveal how it reconciles claims to be at the heart of Europe with its opt-out of European monetary union and non-participation in other areas. Perhaps the most promising area is defence, where tight budget constraints and the US administration's active support for a new European force operating under the Nato umbrella may succeed in accelerating agreement in 1996. But many diplomats in Brussels suspect that the temptation will be to defer tough choices, even if the price is a delay in EU membership for the eastern Europeans. What is clear is that the past few days have witnessed the start of a constitutional debate on the future of Europe. Nobody can stop it.</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Tokyo digs in over market share targets JAPAN will vigorously resist any pressure to accept further market share targets or any other numerical measure of market openness, a senior official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said yesterday. Mr Sozaburo Okamatsu, director general of Miti's international trade policy bureau, said Japan was not in a position to accept proposals from the US to grant a specific market share for a product because Japan was 'not a state-planned economy'. Mr Okamatsu's remarks come as the US and Japan prepare for government-level talks in Hawaii to assess the progress made by the US-Japan semiconductor arrangement, which the US industry has interpreted as a commitment to raise the foreign market share of the Japanese chip market to 20 per cent by the end of 1992. Calls have also been growing in the US to adopt specific market share targets to measure progress made in opening foreign markets, particularly in Japan. The US advisory committee on trade policy and negotiations, a trade advisory panel chaired by Mr James D Robinson, outgoing chairman of American Express, has submitted a recommendation to President Bill Clinton calling for the use of quantitative indicators which would estimate the dollar value of various formal and informal trade barriers. The US insistence on a 20 per cent market share in chips reflects its long-held frustration in trying to open the Japanese market as well as the belief that a clear, measurable target is necessary to achieve results. Japan says it has never accepted that it is committed to granting a 20 per cent foreign share of its semiconductor market and is keen to head off any attempt to introduce further such targets. 'We are a market-oriented economy so we cannot promise any market share to be taken by foreign products,' Mr Okamatsu stressed. 'The EC is also taking a keen interest in our bilateral talks with the US. If Japan promised market share in specific sectors to the US, the EC will also want the same thing. We cannot agree to it,' he said. Japan faces calls from the US for greater access to its paper, car car-parts and construction markets. Lack of progress in an agreement made by the five largest Japanese car manufacturers to make efforts to buy Dollars 19bn (Pounds 13.3bn) of US car parts and import 20,700 US cars was criticised on Tuesday by House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt. The US and Japan are also conducting this week a review of a bilateral construction market access accord which Washington claims Japan has not complied with so far.</p>

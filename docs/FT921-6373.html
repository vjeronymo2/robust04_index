			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (6): An inflation hedge if you buy wisely - Equities EQUITIES ARE the siren voice of the investment market. Private investors are conscious of the allure; everyone knows someone who has made a killing, either on a privatisation or a small company stock. But many investors are also aware of the rocks on which the sirens sit. The recent corporate collapses of Maxwell and Polly Peck have illustrated how quickly the value of equity investments can evaporate. Fear is normally stronger than greed. All too often, a roaring bull market is required before investors can be persuaded to leave the safety of their building society for the excitement of equities. Of course, they then buy at exactly the wrong moment, and are then disillusioned for another decade when share prices inevitably fall. The danger with keeping money for long periods in the building society is of a fall in the real (after inflation) rather than the nominal value of capital. Over the period 1946-91, figures from Barclays de Zoete Wedd show that the average* annual real return on equities was 6.14 per cent; the real return on Treasury bills (a rough equivalent to building society returns) over the same period was just 0.53 per cent per year. From these figures, equities seem to be the obvious inflation hedge, but there are snags. BZW's indices do not reflect costs and, of course, there is no guarantee that the stocks selected by private investors will match the performance of the indices. At the moment, the risk and tax-free returns provided by National Savings (a real 4.5 per cent if held for five years) look very attractive compared with BZW's figures for equities. National Savings (see letter N) do not provide income, however, and investors should not forget the ability of shares to pay a rising income in the form of dividends. BZW's equity income index show that dividends increased almost tenfold in nominal terms between 1970 and 1991, and rose 40 per cent in real terms over the same period. So there is a strong long-term case for investing in equities. What strategy ought you to follow? To get a properly diversified portfolio of individual shares, you probably need to invest around Pounds 50,000. For most small investors, the risk of picking the wrong stocks is so high that it is best for them to gain access to equities via the vehicle of a unit or investment trust (see letter U). Those who have enough money to invest directly in shares will still probably need the advice and help of a stockbroker. The difficulty of finding the right broker is what dissuades many people from investing in shares. Brokers have a snooty image, and the man in the street often assumes that his meagre portfolio will not be worthy of attention. In fact, after some rather lean years for their industry, brokers are a lot more welcoming than they used to be. What sort of broker you need depends on how much you know about the market. If you haven't a clue about shares, then you probably need the services of a discretionary broker. He or she will manage the portfolio on your behalf, and sort out such matters as the collection of dividends and the efficient use of your capital gains tax allowance. These days, such brokers will often charge a fee, based on the size of your portfolio. They have therefore every incentive to see that your investments perform, because their fee will rise in proportion. An advisory, or dealing-only, broker will be more suitable for those who know their way round the stock market and which stocks to select. Such brokers may be available for a quick chat on the lines of 'what do you think of ICI shares?' but mainly they will leave the decisions up to you. They will be paid in terms of commission on each trade they make on your behalf, and the rates they charge will be one of the most important factors in your choice. Small investors should particularly look for the minimum commission per deal. A directory of brokers can be obtained by writing to the Stock Exchange in London. Alternatively, there is a full list in the back of Beginners' Guide to Investment, by Bernard Gray, published by Business Books Limited at Pounds 8.95, which also contains a lot of useful information on owning shares.</p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THOMPSON'S WALKOUT DOES NOT GENERATE A GREAT DEAL OF SUPPORT  </P> <P> Proposal 42 should be used to penalize schools -- not athletes. In this way, if  a school graduated a specified percentage of Prop. 48 student/athletes (try  75%), then the school would be allowed to give scholarships to Prop. 48  students.  </P> <P> But if a school failed to graduate that specified percentage of Prop. 48  students, it would be relegated to Proposal 42 status (meaning no scholarships  for those students who do not meet academic requirements.)  </P> <P> The only loser then is the coach who is more concerned with wins than the  academic progress of his players.  </P> <P> DON WEST  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

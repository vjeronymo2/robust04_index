			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Carmen del Riego report: "Aznar Accuses Felipe Gonzalez of </F> Passivity and Connivance in Roldan's Escape"]    [Text] Madrid -- Jose Maria Aznar yesterday [in the  Congress of Deputies] accused the prime minister of "passivity,  obstruction, and negligence," both in the struggle against  corruption and in the escape of [former Civil Guard Director  General] Roldan, and although he did not directly demand  Gonzalez' resignation -- "a suggestion that has become the  general opinion" -- he stated that what Spain demands is "a  process of ethical and political regeneration," and that it  needs to calm down and regain confidence in its institutions.    In his opinion, this can be achieved "because we live in a  democratic society with all the necessary means for emerging  from the mire into which you have plunged it. Under democracy,  the citizens always have the last word, and, make no mistake  about it, the people, who angrily observe the degrading  spectacle of this government, will know how to use the polls to  express unequivocally what they want. The Spanish people will  soon have an opportunity to make their views known. Let us give  them their say."    In a tough tone, much applauded from the seats of his party,  which even gave him a standing ovation at the end of his speech,  and booed from the Socialist seats, the People's Party [PP]  chairman expressed in the debate held in the Congress in Felipe  Gonzalez' presence his conviction that there was government  connivance in Roldan's escape because "all that we know is that  you believed, for reasons that I prefer not to imagine, that the  best thing was to leave him at large, while you looked the other  way," and again attributed the greatest responsibility for the  corruption cases to Gonzalez himself, among other things, in not  allowing [Deputy Prime Minister] Serra's appearance before the  Roldan committee.    But the criticisms concerned not only the prime minister but  also the nationalists supporting him, of whom he said that "they  show him the steps he should take and excuse him from  legitimizing his position in this house in return for a  legitimization by telephone. It is they who have a hold over  him." This support led him to say that it should be asked who  is in charge in this country, and whether Gonzalez is "the right  interlocutor, or whether it would be more effective to pick up  that telephone through which they send him the assurances and  instructions." However, in Jose Maria Aznar's opinion, this  support does not give the government stability because "you  people are experiencing the uncertainties of Damocles, waiting  for another photocopy to fall on you," and without resolving  anything, since all that he [Gonzalez] does is "drop his  intimate associates to save his own position."    In this connection, he referred to the reports published  yesterday linking Serra with Roldan, and stated that "if what  has been published is correct, we could guess why he appointed  Mr. Roldan, why he protected him, and perhaps why he escaped.  Because he was Mr. Serra's intimate and protege."    In order to support his arguments, the People's Party  chairman referred to headlines in foreign newspapers over the  past few days, which he summed up with the remark: "Never was  there greater brazenness; he [Gonzalez] stands his ground and  defies us," adding that what worries him [Aznar] is "that his  image may contaminate the post he holds and that he can say  those things as Spanish prime minister."    Aznar denied that Gonzalez has any chance of guaranteeing  stability and combating corruption, "because you have  facilitated the task of the corrupt; you are a hostage of your  own past and, to cap it all, you allow Mr. Roldan to escape.  Your part has been passivity, obstruction, and negligence,  thinking not of Spain, the government, or the economic  situation, but of yourself and saving your face," because, Aznar  said, "you are threatened by a fugitive from justice who cannot  be found, you are threatened by foreign investors, and you are  constrained by your parliamentary allies, who dictate to you the  resignations and even order your appearances. Spain is being  governed by those who are constantly afraid that somebody may  talk too much."</p>

			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Georgia's rulers vow to crush ex-president: Risk of civil war still 'quite real' GEORGIA'S ruling Military Council claimed at the weekend that it would easily crush an attempted comeback by the republic's ousted president, but the acting prime minister, Mr Tengiz Sigua, admitted that the risk of civil war was still 'quite real'. The council said supporters of Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia, the ex-president, had abandoned Samtredi, one of their key strongholds about 180 miles from Tbilisi, the capital. Tass news agency reported that Mr Gamsakhurdia was so desperate for weapons to arm his supporters that he had launched a raid on units of the former Soviet army. However, gunmen, some of them dressed in paramilitary uniform, failed to prevent a rally yesterday in Tbilisi in support of Mr Gamsakhurdia. About 3,000 people who massed at the city's railway station refused to disperse even when the gunmen fired into the air. Instead, the protesters marched toward them, forcing them to retreat. There were no reports of injuries. Mr Tengiz Kitovani, one of the guerrilla leaders who helped chase Mr Gamsakhurdia out of Georgia before he returned last Thursday, said that the former leader still had popular support in the western town of Zugdidi - but only 300 armed men to challenge the council's rule. Undeterred by the challenge, the Military Council, which seized power to end what it described as dictatorial rule by Mr Gamsakhurdia, has launched long-delayed market reforms. It has decreed the privatisation of trade and the service sector from February 1, and a start to handing land over to peasants for the rebirth of private agriculture. Meanwhile, General Valery Patrikeyev, commander of the Transcaucasus district, which encompasses Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, said at the weekend that relations with the Georgian leadership had improved since Mr Gamsakhurdia's fall. He said the council had revoked an earlier parliamentary decision describing the former armed forces as an 'occupation army', and armed raids on the Soviet army had significantly decreased. But he said the armed forces would in no circumstances intervene to help the Military Council defeat Mr Gamsakhurdia. He said interference in the republic's politics would spell catastrophe  - as it had in April 1988, when the army killed 88 people in a crackdown on pro-independence demonstrations in Tbilisi.</p>

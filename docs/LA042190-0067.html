			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FEDERAL EXPRESS IMPOSTOR SNAGS 2 MORE IN DELIVERY SCAM  </P> <P> A man posing as a Federal Express employee has tricked two more people into  giving him cash for deliveries from non-existent state agencies, bringing the  total to 27 victims in San Diego County.  </P> <P> At 4 p.m. Thursday, the con artist entered Miyoko Dry Cleaning, in the 2900  block of University Avenue, with a delivery from a fabric association in  Sacramento, said owner Miyoko Knox.  </P> <P> "He came in at a busy time, during rush hour, when people pick up clothes,"  Knox said. "He said that he was from Federal Express and had a COD package for  me to sign for. He had my license number and the business' identification  number matched."  </P> <P> When the man left, Knox said, she opened the envelope and found three blank  1989 tax forms. She said she called police Friday morning after a friend told  her of a newspaper story about the scam.  </P> <P> At noon Friday, the same scenario was played out at Coffees of the World, in  the 4500 block of University Avenue.  </P> <P> "I was a dummy," said Maurice Mizrahi. "All the license numbers on the  (package) were correct, everything was correct."  </P> <P> The package's return address was the State Board of Equalization, Mizrahi said.  </P> <P> Since Feb. 1, police have received 27 reports from small businesses that have  paid the man $18.50 per delivery.  </P> <P> The thief, wearing either a brown or blue uniform bearing Federal Express'  emblem, delivers envelopes stuffed with blank Internal Revenue Service forms.  He also leaves receipts with return addresses from non-existent state agencies.  </P> <P> Federal Express does not deliver packages COD said police spokesman Bill  Robinson.  </P> <P> The man is described as white, in his 40s, about 6-foot-3 and weighing 160 to  170 pounds. He has brown, collar-length hair and was wearing clear, wire-rimmed  glasses.  </P> <P> Robinson said similar operations have been reported in Sacramento, Fresno,  Orange County and Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Anyone with information on the scam can call police at 696-1655.  </P></p>

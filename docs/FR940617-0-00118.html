			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA included as a prohibited act any attempt to circumvent the residence time exclusion of a portable or transportable engine in (2)(iii) by means of removing the engine from its location for a period and then returning it to that same location. In such cases, the time between removal of the engine and its return to service (or replacement) would be counted towards the time period specified in (2)(iii).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Final Definition of Nonroad Engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The majority of comments received on the revised definition supported the usage-based definition, as opposed to the initially proposed power-based definition. Still, most commenters requested that EPA make two modifications to the revised nonroad engine definition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first modification requested by the commenters relates to section (2)(ii) of the revised definition which stated that an engine is not a nonroad engine if it is regulated under section 111 or section 202 of the CAA. The commenters expressed concern that this portion of the definition would allow states to promulgate state regulations under the authority of section 111, creating a loophole in the state preemption framework, whereby states would be able to regulate preempted engines. They contended that this would result in dual standards for an engine, as both stationary and nonroad.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second modification requested by the commenters relates to the application of the 12 month residence time limitation to seasonal operations. While most commenters agreed with the proposal to use a 12 month residence time limit to distinguish between mobile and stationary use of portable or transportable engines, several commenters opposed the proposal to consider residence time based on ``seasonal'' use. These commenters asserted that excluding an undefined group of engines for an indeterminate period of time, between one and 365 days, is neither reasonable nor enforceable. Moreover, the same commenters requested that EPA clarify that the 12 month residence time applies only to those portable and transportable engines which are integral parts of fixed stationary sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter opposed the 12 month time limit on the grounds that it could create a regulatory vacuum which would result in some engines escaping all nonroad engine and stationary engine regulations. In support of the revised nonroad engine definition, another commenter stated that the equipment used on a military installation should be designed so emissions are reduced by the engine manufacturer and not by the end user. The commenter requested that EPA clarify the term ``location'' in a manner that would permit a ``location'' to exist within a stationary source.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comments from a State agency supported the elimination of the horsepower criteria for nonroad engines, but expressed concern that the new definition would cause it to lose permitting authority for engines it was currently regulating as stationary engines. The commenter suggested that those states with permitting programs be allowed to maintain permitting authority over those engines which they had previously determined to be stationary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One local air pollution agency disagreed with EPA's conclusion that portable engines are nonroad engines. In support of its position, the agency cited title V of the CAA as evidence that Congress recognized that some stationary sources were moveable. If EPA were to adopt a definition based on residence time, the agency requested that three months, rather than a year, be the cutoff point beyond which an engine would no longer be considered nonroad.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency believes that the revised nonroad definition eliminates the potential for the arbitrary classification of internal combustion engines as nonroad or stationary sources based on engine size. Rather, as noted by the commenters, the revised definition is based on the use of the engine, which is a more appropriate and reliable indicator of its classification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has considered the modification requested by some commenters regarding that portion of the definition that provides an internal combustion engine is not a nonroad engine if it is regulated under CAA section 111. The Agency has amended the revised definition to provide that an internal combustion engine is not a nonroad engine if ``The engine is regulated by a federal New Source Performance Standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act.'' Thus, under provision (2)(ii), national emission standards for an internal combustion engine must be promulgated before it is classified as a stationary engine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Contrary to the comments, EPA believes that it is appropriate to exclude from the nonroad definition engines that remain at sources that only operate on a seasonal basis. Although such sources, such as canning facilities, may operate for less than 12 months in any one year, they operate regularly for a similar time period year after year. Operations for a seasonal source generally occur at the same location, rather than traveling between different states or regions. Engines that are located at a seasonal source during the full annual operations period of that source should be considered a part of that source. They are clearly integral parts of these facilities. Moreover, as such sources produce emissions that can be calculated on a regular basis, a local air quality agency or other authority should be able to reasonably enforce stationary source regulations. As a result, the Agency has maintained the seasonal source exclusion. However, as requested by several commenters, EPA has revised the language for the exclusion to make it clearer. EPA believes that a seasonal source is a stationary source because it functions at only one location for its full annual operating period, even if that period is less than 12 months. EPA has specified in the final regulations that a seasonal source must remain at a single location on a permanent basis (that is, at least two years) and must operate approximately three months or more each year. EPA also clarified that an engine located at a seasonal source is an engine that remains at the source for the full annual operating period of the source. This should eliminate any confusion as to whether certain sources are considered to be seasonal sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

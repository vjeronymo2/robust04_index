			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> ROCK WARS;  </P> <P> SOLD OUT;  </P> <P> VENTURA THEATRE CREDITED WITH BOOSTING MUSIC SCENE AND ACCUSED OF WOOING ACTS  FROM OTHER CLUBS  </P> <P> Ticket-holders at the Ventura Theatre's recent concert by Clarence Clemons  couldn't believe their luck when the former saxophone player for Bruce  Springsteen made room on stage for The Boss himself.  </P> <P> After the impromptu serenade by the performer whose last Southern California  concert sold out the Los Angeles Sports Arena for four days, they watched in  awe as Jackson Browne and frequent companion Daryl Hannah jumped into the fray.  </P> <P> "They had a treat like they've never had before," said the nightclub's owner,  Gary Folgner.  </P> <P> Perhaps no single event better illustrates how far the local music scene has  come since Folgner, a veteran concert promoter from Orange County, opened the  62-year-old movie place in 1988 to a caliber of acts that Ventura County  residents once found only in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> Ventura, after all, was the community that two years ago turned a cold shoulder  to the Grateful Dead over complaints of rowdy behavior on the part of fans at a  previous concert.  </P> <P> And this was the 12,000-square-foot pre-Depression gem where a group of local  businessmen had failed four years ago to establish a nightclub. Now, after  nearly two years of losses routine in launching a business, Folgner said he has  begun to break even at the 850-seat venue and expects to begin turning a profit  next year.  </P> <P> The club owner even has plans, he said, to add three more clubs -- in  Sacramento, Riverside and Tempe, Ariz. -- to his portfolio, which includes the  Coach House, a nightclub in San Juan Capistrano. As an additional measure of  the theater's strength, its management has persuaded the city to triple the  size of Ventura's annual fall music festival, move it from Arroyo Verde Park  and place it in the theater's downtown neighborhood.  </P> <P> "We've pioneered a lot at the Ventura Theatre," said Folgner, "and we're going  to continue to be pioneers."  </P> <P> This news is music to the ears of many concert-goers, who applaud the theater's  mix of up-and-coming acts, big-name underground bands and established  performers with more loyal fans than recent hits. Ventura city officials and  business leaders are also pleased.  </P> <P> "It provides a real variety of entertainment, and that's beneficial . . . for  all the cultural reasons and what economists call the ripple effect," said  Ventura Mayor Richard Francis. Theater-goers also "go out to dinner and bars  here and enjoy the rest of the community once they're here," he said.  </P> <P> But some local bands, music critics and other concert promoters aren't as  enthusiastic. They paint an unflattering picture of a place where band members  say they are pressured to sell tickets and bouncers are accused of being overly  aggressive. And Ventura Theatre, it is alleged, has wooed name acts from  Central Coast nightclubs after promoters spent time and money developing an  audience for them.  </P> <P> "They're the boss, and they don't let you forget it," said a band member who  asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals. "They're really arrogant to  deal with."  </P> <P> Folgner, whose acts range from jazz to salsa to rock to country, dismissed the  complaints as "professional envy and maybe not understanding the business."  Concert promoters, who say that the Ventura Theatre has wreaked havoc with the  club scene along the Central Coast, counter that Folgner knows only too well  that they understand the business.  </P> <P> "We put in all the brain work and the savvy and they reap the rewards," said  Loanne Wullaert, an Isla Vista record store owner who has brought acts to the  UC Santa Barbara watering hole, The Graduate.  </P> <P> Wullaert says she has watched a string of acts including Fishbone, the Red Hot  Chili Peppers and the Neville Brothers go to the Ventura Theatre after she  introduced them to local audiences.  </P> <P> She maintains that the turn of events violated "an unwritten rule called 'the  first right of refusal.' "  </P> <P> "If you've booked an act before in a market, you're supposed to get it the next  time," she said. "That way, if you've lost money on it the first time, you get  to make it up."  </P> <P> While he bristled at the suggestion that he's riding on anybody's coattails,  Folgner insisted there's nothing wrong with wooing acts away from the clubs  with the promise of bigger audiences and higher pay.  </P> <P> "Just because you had Bon Jovi and Bruce Springsteen when they were starting  out doesn't mean they're going to come back to your club when they're in town,"  he said. "Acts grow out of clubs. They move into theaters, then go to sheds and  then arenas." Signs of a lopsided battle among music showcases along the  Central Coast nonetheless abound. The list of casualties includes:  </P> <P> * Ventura's Holiday Inn Beach Resort. The number of concerts offered in the  inn's Top of the Harbor restaurant has dropped from 50 in 1987 to 20 last year  because of competition from the Ventura Theatre in combination with company  policies that restrict days and months when acts can play, said Greg Bennett,  the inn's general manager during the 3-year-old "Classic Concerts Series."  Plans next year, he said, call for only six acts.  </P> <P> * At least one pair of independent promoters in Santa Barbara County, Wullaert  and her husband, Robert, claim they have stopped booking acts because they  can't compete with the theater. Stephen Cloud, an 18-year veteran of concert  promoting in Santa Barbara, said competition from the theater was one of many  reasons he has stopped booking acts at the 664-seat Lobero Theatrer and the  2000-seat Arlington Theater. "It's eliminated the scene here," Cloud said.  </P> <P> Some competitors have taken steps to protect their turf.  </P> <P> Ventura's Holiday Inn has switched from rock and jazz to country music, said  Bennett, the former manager. However, the approach has lost some of its punch  because the Ventura Theatre shortly afterward began offering some of the same  acts.  </P> <P> Carnaval, a 350-seat dance club in Santa Barbara, has retaliated by shunning  established artists in favor of rising stars.  </P> <P> "They can have the dinosaurs," said club Manager Bill Hardie.  </P> <P> Ventura Theatre also has its share of detractors among local band members, who  complain of being pressured to sell advance tickets to concerts under an  arrangement that allows them to pocket a $2 profit on each ticket instead of  getting paid.  </P> <P> "He's never said, 'If you don't do this you won't be asked back,' but you kind  of assume it's that way, said Frank Barajas, the lead singer of Durango 95, a  Ventura-based folk rock group.  </P> <P> Because they sometimes find it difficult to sell tickets, band members will  forgo their cut to sell the tickets at a cheaper price, he said. "It's like  paying to play."  </P> <P> But as Raging Arb has found, even selling tickets to a concert is no assurance  that a local performer will appear.  </P> <P> "We've sold 150 to 200 tickets and then they called to say they've changed  their minds about playing," said Ross Emery, a member of the Ventura  country-blues band, of the theater.  </P> <P> Folgner said he didn't remember the incident, but said if it happened, it was  the decision of the name act playing and not the theater.  </P> <P> "You always have the pressure of the act that's playing there to have someone  they've been playing with," Folgner said.  </P> <P> Folgner said he does pay local bands -- $100 a concert -- and defended the  ticket-selling practice.  </P> <P> "It gives the opportunity for them to make more money," he said, noting that  the approach is used by some Los Angeles clubs.  </P> <P> Then there are complaints about the theater's bouncers.  </P> <P> "I've seen them use chokeholds," Wullaert said. "I've seen five men descend on  a woman. They've grabbed people by the hair to get them off the stage."  </P> <P> So allegedly hard-handed is the theater's approach that Christina Zafiris, an  rock radio show host at UC Santa Barbara radio station KCSB, said she no longer  promotes its shows on the radio.  </P> <P> "They use Nazi-type tactics," said Beth Allen, a music critic for the Santa  Barbara Independent, a weekly entertainment tabloid.  </P> <P> Folgner said he doubts that the violent incidents occurred but said his  bouncers routinely remove fans who try to go on stage or engage in  slam-dancing.  </P> <P> "You're making entertainment," he  </P> <P> said. "You have to make sure people don't get hurt. They come to see concerts  -- not gang wars."  </P> <P> He said he learned that lesson the hard way. The Ventura Police Department had  to be called in to quell a disturbance that broke out between rival gangs  during a performance by Social Distortion, a punk band that was one of the  first acts to play the theater. If the latest incarnation of the Ventura  Theatre has become the new bully on the block, it started out as an 98-pound  weakling.  </P> <P> Built in 1928 for vaudeville acts, the ornate theater had gone through two  revival attempts before Folgner signed a 10-year lease and completed $250,000  in renovations.  </P> <P> Folgner also had his spate of bad luck. He said he lost $300,000 in the first  year and $250,000 in the second.  </P> <P> "We're not where we should be," he said. "We're just barely breaking even. I  think next year we'll start to make up for the losses."  </P> <P> What has made the latest version of the theater succeed, it turns out, is also  what has made it a nearly invincible opponent in bidding wars.  </P> <P> The theater is part of a booking network that includes not just the 400-seat  Coach House but also The Strand in Redondo Beach, Calamity Jane's in Las Vegas  and Bogart's in Long Beach.  </P> <P> "Basically, you can say, 'If you give me one day, I'll give you four others,' "  Folgner said. Folgner's plans to open three new clubs in California and Arizona  would presumably enhance the theater's ability to attract talent. Folgner also  points out that he doesn't have to battle some of the same weaknesses as his  brethren in the Santa Barbara market, which has a potential audience of only  300,000 within a 30-mile radius. Ventura has 750,000 people within the same  number of miles. It stretches from Santa Barbara to Thousand Oaks. If Folgner  has profited at the expense of the music scene elsewhere, he appears to have  spread the wealth.  </P> <P> Consider Peter Weal, owner of Wild Planet, a Main Street record store located  less than a block from the theater.  </P> <P> "If there's a good show, I'll stay open late and make an extra $100 to $200,"  he said.  </P> <P> Another benefactor has been the San Souci Cocktail Lounge, a cowboy bar located  across Chestnut Street from the theater (see related story below).  </P> <P> Even the Holiday Inn has profited, Bennett said. Many of the bands stay there  after playing the theater and concert-goers frequently drop by for dinner or  even spend the night.  </P> <P> "It's healthy to have someone like the Ventura Theatre in town," he said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> EL CAMINO REAL SHUTS DOWN KENNEDY, 20-0  </P> <P> Lest anyone suspect that El Camino Real High's upset win over San Fernando last  week was a fluke, the Conquistadores on Friday night provided more evidence  that they are for real in a convincing 20-0 win at Kennedy.  </P> <P> Conquistadore running back Ryan Marine ran 16 times for 139 yards and a  touchdown.  </P> <P> Quarterback Evan Howland added 30 yards in 11 carries.  </P> <P> The win kept El Camino Real (4-1, 3-0) unbeaten in Northwest Valley Conference  play.  </P> <P> Playing before a homecoming crowd, Kennedy's spread offense looked like it was  spread too thin.  </P> <P> Quarterback Mike McMullen completed only 11 of 33 attempts for 80 yards and  threw two interceptions. Running back Ontiwaun Carter returned to the lineup  after missing a week because of a bladder infection. After being held to 45  yards in 18 carries, he might just as well have stayed in bed.  </P> <P> The Cougars finished with 139 yards in offense.  </P> <P> "Those guys are tough," Kennedy Coach Bob Francola said in an understatement.  </P> <P> El Camino Real gave an early indication of how the game would go, scoring on  its first possession. In what was to become a familiar sight, Marine ran  straight up the middle behind center Troy Snider and guards Juan Hernandez and  William Manning. El Camino Real ground out a 12-play, 73-yard drive with Marine  scoring from the one.  </P> <P> A few plays later, the Conquistadore defense made its mark, forcing Kennedy  wide receiver Jimmy Rodriguez to fumble and recovering at the Cougars' 18-yard  line.  </P> <P> Howland finished a short drive by diving in from the one. After a missed  conversion, El Camino Real's second of the game, the Conquistadores led, 12-0.  </P> <P> By halftime, Kennedy had only 57 yards in offense.  </P></p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Osprey ahead of forecast at Pounds 90,000 Osprey Communications, the advertising and marketing services group, reported pre-tax profits ahead of expectations at Pounds 90,000 for the six months to November 30. The outcome was on turnover of Pounds 10.9m and compared with profits of Pounds 314,000 on turnover of Pounds 13.1m last time and a loss of Pounds 336,000 on income of Pounds 25.6m at the 1992 year end. Mr F John French, chairman and chief executive, said the result reflected increased gross margins and tightly controlled overheads. Cash flow had been positive for the period, he said, and the company had repaid part of its term loan. However, bank facilities remained almost fully committed. Earnings per share worked through at 0.43p (1.47p). There is no interim dividend (last time's interim of 0.65p was the sole payment for the year).</p>

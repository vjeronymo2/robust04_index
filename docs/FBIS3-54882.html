			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Russian Central Bank Warns </F> Netherlands Assets Management Firm"]    [Text] Moscow -- The Russian Central Bank yesterday issued  a written warning against the Netherlands assets management firm  GMM bv [Global Money Management, Inc.], which is principally  active in the Russian market. The warning comes just days after  the disclosure by SEGODNYA, the Russian daily, that GMM had  financed the election campaign by ultra-nationalist  Zhirinovskiy.    In a letter, the bank wrote that the illegal activities of  GMM constitute a "direct threat to the interests of people who  have entrusted the firm with their money."    GMM is operating illegally as it does not have a bank  license. According to A. Nenachov, the Russian director and sole  shareholder in the Netherlands bv, this is not necessary as GMM  is a trust company. Russian law makes no provision for this  kind of institution.    The Russian Finance Ministry issued an identical statement  at  the end of October, but this was not acted upon. The political  allegations made by SEGODNYA shed new light on the affair. The  only basis for this warning is that a member of Zhirinovskiy's  liberal party, Aleksey Zoyjev, is an adviser to GMM.    The Russian daily SEGODNYA is financed by MOST bank, one of  three commercial banks which supported the election campaign by  Russia's Choice. Russia's Choice Deputy Prime Minister Gaydar  unexpectedly lost to Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Party in the  elections. Russia's Choice has been seeking an explanation for  Zhirinovskiy's success ever since. After allegations that  former members of the KGB financed and supported the Liberal  Party, the GMM is now being used as a scapegoat.    Shortly before the elections, Russia's Choice was itself  involved in a scandal. The U.S. marketing company Sawyer Miller  Group produced advertising on Russian television for Gaydar's  party. This was part of a privatization campaign conducted by  Sawyer Miller with U.S. Government money. Instead of the usual  slogan -- "Your voucher, your choice" -- Sawyer Miller broadcast  an advertisement immediately before the elections with the  slogan "Your choice, Russia's choice."    GMM's activities are scarcely any different than those of  other Russian financial institutions which are earning large  amounts of capital in Russia's economic climate of high  inflation. The only grounds for criticism is that GMM presents  itself as an experienced Netherlands player on stock exchanges  in places such as Amsterdam, New York, and Tokyo. GMM, however,  is not really involved in such activities, but such a claim  relieves the firm of the obligation to apply for a bank license  in Russia. The company is in fact an inactive "incorporated  company" which was taken over and given new life by 27-year-old  Muscovite Nenachov, who also set up Moscow's first federal bank.    This is the first time that one of the new capitalist  institutions which flourished under Gaydar's influence has been  involved in a political scandal. GMM's Moscow office is closed  at the moment for the "New Year holidays."</p>

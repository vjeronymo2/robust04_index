			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Kozhukhov: "Kim Il-Song's Loggers Will </F> Remain in Siberia After All, and They Can Flee from There to  South Korea If They Wish"]    [Text] The fate of the 7,000 loggers from South Korea  felling timber in Khabarovsk Kray will be decided at talks  opening in Pyongyang.    The stumbling block at these talks -- this is the third  round  -- is differences between Moscow and Pyongyang over the legal  status of the loggers in Siberia. The old agreement, signed  back in the time of developed socialism, allowed the Korean  authorities to dispense justice in the logging camps in  accordance with North Korean laws. But the agreement expired  last December.    Moscow does not rule out the probability of violations of  the  code of the builders of communism occurring in the logging  camps: You cannot really expect refined behavior from operators  of the "Druzhba" gasoline-driven saw, even if they are dedicated  to the chuche idea. But Moscow is nonetheless insisting that  citizens of the "land of morning freshness" -- North Korea --  working in Siberia should now enjoy all the democratic rights  enjoyed by the citizens of the "country building capitalism" --  Russia. For example, the right to strike, an eight-hour working  day, and the opportunity to move anywhere, provided they have  papers.    "If these demands are not heeded there will be no  agreement,"  Valentin Moiseyev, chief of the Russian Foreign Ministry Korea  department, said. He described as "rubbish" an AP report the  other day that North Korea has lately been evacuating its  loggers from Siberia, in order to deprive them of the  opportunity to "choose freedom" and flee to South Korea.    Citing sources in the South Korean capital, the agency  insists that at least 170 fugitive loggers have taken refuge in  remote camps in the taiga in the hope of being able to get to  the southern part of the historic homeland. Pyongyang regards  them as having been "kidnapped" by Seoul, where a special  commission has even been set up to resolve matters related to  the resettlement of former loggers. Seoul is rather afraid that  there might by spies working for Kim Il-song, not to mention  criminals, among them. The problem is complicated by the fact  that the fugitives have to be taken at their word: Their  identity cards are permanently held by the labor camps they have  left.    Valentin Moiseyev tends to take a sardonic view of stories  of  supposed atrocities by Pyongyang special services in Khabarovsk  Kray. According to Foreign Ministry data, only four fugitive  loggers have gotten to South Korea so far, and illegally at that  -- which, as a matter of fact, was unnecessary: Russia would  neither help nor hinder loggers wishing to go either to North or  to South Korea.    The talk of tortured dissidents and of a prison regime in  these logging camps may turn out to be untrue, if only because  Kim Il-song's loggers are little different from the so-called  Soviet workers abroad who resisted evacuation from Iraq during  the war in the Persian Gulf or from battle-torn Yemen. The  loggers are highly paid by North Korean standards, and many of  them bribed officials at home to get the chance to wield an ax  in Siberian temperatures of 60 below.    According to Valentin Moiseyev, the North Koreans' selfless  work in the Siberian taiga means a net profit for our country.  Two-thirds of what they fell -- and that is three million cubic  meters of timber per year -- stays in Russia.    It is not inconceivable that the problem of fugitive loggers  will be touched on at the talks with DPRK Deputy Foreign  Minister Li Yen Gu [name as transliterated], who is in Moscow.  The story is that the senior diplomat's talks will cover the  whole range of bilateral relations, including Russia's proposal  on holding an international conference on security problems on  the Korean peninsula.</p>

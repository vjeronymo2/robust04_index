			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (The Economy): Rapid fall in borrowing fuels tax cut expectation - PSBR outlook The Budget announced a much more rapid reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement than its predecessor, from Pounds 34.4bn this year to only Pounds 5bn in three years' time. Lower than expected inflation explains the bulk of the improvement in the public sector finances. Mr Kenneth Clarke's first budget predicted a PSBR of Pounds 38bn in 1994-5, falling to Pounds 12bn by 1997-8. Most economists had expected Mr Clarke to announce a more rapid medium-term reduction in the PSBR than he predicted a year ago. But the prediction of a budget surplus will raise speculation that tax rates will be lowered in the next few years. The cumulative effect of the reduced cash spending totals announced yesterday is that overall spending in 1997-98 will be Pounds 9bn lower than predicted a year ago, at Pounds 272bn. The Treasury's lower forecasts for future inflation will eventually mean that tax receipts will be lower than previous forecast. By 1998, general government receipts are expected to be Pounds 8.5bn below the level predicted last year. The overall effect of lower inflation, however, is positive, because of the scope for lower cash spending totals. This year's fall in unemployment also contributed, by reducing the cost of social security. Yesterday's amended public spending plans provide for spending to rise at less than 3 per cent in nominal terms over the next three years, or 0.25 per cent annual real growth. The faster reduction in the level of the PSBR means that the Treasury now expects net public sector debt as a percentage of GDP to peak at 42.75 per cent in 1996, falling to 36.75 per cent by the end of the century. The Treasury pointed out that the new forecasts implied the UK would meet the EU's excessive deficit procedure by 1996-97. The general government deficit is then expected to be 2.25 per cent, below the 3 per cent of GDP laid down in the Maastricht Treaty. The new medium-term spending plans show general government expenditure, excluding privatisation proceeds, declining over time as a share of GDP. The Treasury said it showed 'real GGE growth over the next three years averaging between 0.5 and 0.75 per cent per annum, well below the projected growth rate of the economy'. General government expenditure as a percentage of GDP is now expected to fall from 43.5 per cent this year to 41 per cent in 1998-99. Tax revenues as a share of GDP are predicted to rise from 37.25 per cent this year to 40 per cent in 1999. The rise in interest rates has raised the medium-term cost of servicing the government debt. The Treasury said government debt interest would rise by a third in the three years to 1996-97. After that it is expected to stablise as borrowing is reduced, from Pounds 19.2bn to Pounds 26bn, and is expected to stay at this level for several years.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The hearing at the European Court regarding the EU  [European Union] Commission's appeal against Greece on the  economic embargo against Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia--FYROM] concluded this afternoon. In its appeal, the  EU Commission was asking for temporary measures against Greece  in retaliation for its decision. Our correspondent in Brussels  Kostas Kekis sent the following dispatch:    [Begin Kekis recording] The hearing was in front of the full  session of the European Court. It met behind closed doors and  examined the EU Commission's appeal for temporary measures  against Greece for the embargo on Skopje. The meeting lasted  for over three hours. The representatives of the two sides made  their arguments and answered questions posed by the European  justices. In the coming days, the prosecuting officer is  expected to submit his recommendations. According to the  court's practice, three to four weeks are necessary before the  decision can be issued.    It should be noted that since the official language of the  hearing process was Greek, the defense of the EU Commission's  arguments was assumed by a Greek-speaking French official,  because the Greek legal officials of the EU's executive body  would not participate in the hearing, claiming conscientious  reasons. Finally, it should be noted that the president of the  European Court rejected a demand by Greek European Parliament  Deputies Lambrias, Stamoulis and Nianias who asked to take part  in the hearing in favor of Greece. The European Court's  president recalled Article 137 of the Court's procedural rule,  according to his decision, people do not have the right to  intervene in a trial between the EU Commission and member  states. Only the member states and EU bodies can participate.  At the trial, Greece was represented by Ioannis Kranidhiotis,  Foreign Ministry director general in charge of European issues,  and professors Skouris, Ioannou and Perakis. [end recording]</p>

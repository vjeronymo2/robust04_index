			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: Job switch for Credit Lyonnais director Credit Lyonnais yesterday announced that Mr Francois Gille would relinquish his duties as one of its two managing directors to focus on the bank's legal problems over a Swiss bankruptcy inquiry into Sasea. The Swiss group is a holding used by Italian clients of the state-owned Credit Lyonnais to buy MGM, the Hollywood studio. A Swiss magistrate has singled out Mr Gille - together with Mr Jean-Yves Haberer who ran up huge losses as Credit Lyonnais's president in 1988-93 - in his inquiry into whether the French bank was partly to blame for the Sasea bankruptcy. But Mr Jean Peyrelevade, Credit Lyonnais' new president, made clear that Mr Gille was neither being pushed aside nor was to blame for the 'origin' of the bank's Sasea/MGM problems. When he announced Credit Lyonnais' radical restructuring last month, Mr Peyrelevade shielded Mr Gille from press questions about the latter's responsibility under Mr regime. A parliamentary inquiry into Credit Lyonnais is due to start this month.</p>

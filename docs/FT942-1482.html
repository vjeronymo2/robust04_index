			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Political challenge in Bucharest Romania's main centre-right opposition parties have lodged a no-confidence motion in the country's minority left-wing government. The opposition said it was bringing the motion because the government's economic polices had failed, it had violated the constitution and many of its members were corrupt. The Democratic Agrarian Party, one of four small parties with a pivotal position in the country's hung parliament, said it would support the motion, which is expected to be voted on next Thursday. Until now, the ruling Party of Social Democracy has relied on the DAP, a centre-left party supported by farmers, and the three other parties, for a slim parliamentary majority. It is the fifth no confidence motion the opposition has lodged since the PSD won elections in September 1992. The motion last December failed by just 13 votes. But since then the government has secured Dollars 1bn in new loans from the International Monetary Fund and other official lenders, inflation has halved and the economy begun to stabilise.</p>

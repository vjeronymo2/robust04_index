			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 30 (CNS) -- Minister of the State  Planning Commission Mr. Chen Jinhua said recently that  stabilizing prices and controlling inflation were key needs for  reform, development and stability and were pressing tasks in the  economic sector.    Mr. Chen said that the serious problems at present were the  worsening of inflation and a too fast increase in prices. The  retail sales price index continues to rise based on last year's  increase of 13 percent, a situation seldom seen since reform  started. In particular, soaring prices for daily necessities,  basic services and basic production means which were close to  people's living and national economic development were  intolerable to certain sectors.    Mr. Chen said that the issue of inflation had drawn the  closest attention of the central authorities and the State  Council had taken a series of measures recently to control  prices. These were first, strict control over the speed of  increase in fixed assets investment and the over-expansion of  consumption fund. Second, much attention paid to agricultural  production and the "food basket" project aimed at increasing  supply. Third, strengthened government supervision and  administration over prices including the establishment of price  risk funds for grain and non-stable food, supervision over  prices of 20 kinds of daily necessities and basic services,  marked prices for commodity goods and services and price  inspections throughout the country. Fourth, certain economic  measures to control prices had been adopted to strengthen  transportation of goods and materials and guarantee market  supply. Authorities at various levels had also adopted a series  of such measures.    Mr. Chen said that government must control and administer  prices under the situation of the socialist market economy which  was the common experience of all countries practising market  economy. In the situation where most commodity prices had been  formed by market forces, there was a pressing need to set up and  improve a price control system.</p>

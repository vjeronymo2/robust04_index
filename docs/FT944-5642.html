			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Foreign investors increase holdings of UK shares Foreign ownership of shares in British companies rose significantly last year for the fourth successive year, official figures yesterday showed. With most of the growth coming from US investors, the figures provide a further indication that the movement of US money abroad is having a significant effect on the UK market. The Central Statistical Office said overseas investors were estimated to have held 16.3 per cent of the total number of shares on the UK stock market last year. Those holdings were worth about Pounds 130.2bn at end-1993, a rise of 49.6 per cent on the previous year. The figures show that US investors accounted for almost half of all overseas investment in the UK market at the end of 1993. The shift abroad was part of a trend towards greater asset diversification. Total US investment rose to at least Pounds 49.2bn in 1993, up from Pounds 37.1bn in 1992. The figures also suggest that foreign investors are buying the UK shares with the highest market capitalisation. Mr Jim Waterman, senior vice-president at InterSec Research, a US-based consulting firm that tracks pension fund investment, suggested that was because US fund managers are building portfolios modelled on stock indices. Those are made up mostly of the biggest shares. Foreign interest in the UK has risen sharply from 1992, when overseas investors owned Pounds 80.7bn worth of stock, 13.2 per cent of the total number of shares. UK pension funds continued to be the largest owners of UK shares last year, although their holdings, about a third of total equity, fell slightly. The holdings of individual British investors fell in 1993 to 17.7 per cent of total equity, down from 20.4 per cent in 1992. The CSO said unit trusts, which also represent individual shareholders, held 6.6 per cent of all equities. However, the downward trend in individual shareholding, means that overseas investors now hold almost as much stock in percentage terms as UK insurance companies and individuals.

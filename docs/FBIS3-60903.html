			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Rebecca Maer, Press Association] </F>   [Text] Police were tonight attending a "security alert" at  Gatwick airport involving an aircraft carrying 176 passengers  from Athens, according to the airport duty manager.    The Excalibur Airways flight, number EXC 5812, landed at  7:30  p.m. and is parked on a remote runway while police assess the  situation, the manager said.    Independent Radio News reported that a man on the Airbus A30  plane claimed to have explosives strapped to his body.    The alert was raised by the captain during the flight after  a  male passenger had claimed to have a bomb in his briefcase, said  a spokesman for Excalibur.    There were no details of what happened at that stage, he  said.    "But the captain had a look at the man and decided he was a  low-risk individual. He continued to Gatwick and landed at 8:30  p.m."    The plane was sent to a remote part of the airport where  danger to installations and other aircraft would be minimised,  he said.    "The plane was then surrounded by police, who are in contact  with the crew and presumably directly or indirectly with the man  who claims to have a bomb."</p>

			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Chilean right picks candidate THE DIVIDED right-wing opposition in Chile has nominated Mr Arturo Alessandri as its candidate for the presidential elections in December, in a desperate attempt to present a united front to the electorate. Mr Alessandri, nephew of one president and grandson of another, emerged as a compromise candidate during the convention on Sunday of the Union for Chilean Progress, an electoral pact of five centre-right parties. There were scuffles at the convention when it became clear that Mr Manuel Feliu, leader of the main opposition party, National Renewal, was not going to win. Mr Alessandri, an independent, faces what he acknowledged was an 'uphill battle' in trying to defeat the current presidential front-runner, Mr Eduardo Frei, candidate of the governing centre-left coalition. Mr Frei, himself the son of a former president of Chile, holds what seems to be an unassailable lead in opinion polls. Promising to fight the campaign on the issue of law and order, Mr Alessandri said: 'If the election were held tomorrow, I have no doubt that Frei would win. But be careful - the election is not until next December 11.' Others in the right-wing camp set more modest goals. 'The right cannot win the presidential election,' said Mr Francisco Javier Cuadra, a minister during the military regime which steppped down in 1990. 'The role of the presidential candidate is to permit the right-wing parties to gain a strong Congressional vote.' The country will also hold Congressional elections on December 11. Chile's opposition holds more than a third of the seats in Congress, enough to block important constitutional amendments. Its semblance of unity should enable it to retain that Congressional influence, effectively limiting the next president's authority.</p>

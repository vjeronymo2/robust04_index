			<p>BFN     [Text] Crimea, Kiev, 19 May -- "In conditions when the  informational and organizational-parliamentary aggression by  Russia in Crimea is being continued, we deem it necessary to  stop the transfer of nuclear weapons from the territory of  Ukraine," says the appeal of the People's Movement of Ukraine  (Rukh). Further on the document states that the desire to drag  through the Supreme Council of Crimea the Constitution of 6 May  1992, separate citizenship of Crimea and the dual citizenship as  well as the decision on liquidating the Ukrainian republican  status of Sevastopol; the setting up of its own ministry of  internal affairs and security service; the demands that the  Sevastopol naval base should be transferred to the Russian Black  Sea Fleet; the demands that the Ukrainian armed formations  should be withdrawn from Crimea -- this is far from being the  full list of the violations of the Constitution of Ukraine and  Helsinki accords, and the illegitimate actions by the president  and the Supreme Council of Crimea aimed at splitting Ukraine,  igniting civil war and escalating conflict between Ukraine and  Russia to the limit when its solution becomes possible only by  means of armed struggle.    "All these actions by irresponsible helmsmen of Crimea are  encouraged by the deputies to the State Duma of the Russian  Federation with the president of Russia being aware of this.    "We demand that the world community should take resolute  measures aimed at stopping the interference in the affairs of  the sovereign Ukrainian state on the part of the government  officials and the State Duma of Russia and guaranteeing security  and territorial integrity of Ukraine.    "We demand that the Supreme Council and the president of  Ukraine should take effective measures so that the Constitution  and the laws of Ukraine be abided by in Crimea and that  Ukraine's territorial integrity be ensured," says the appeal by  Rukh.</p>

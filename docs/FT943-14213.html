			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Sheridan leaves Samuel Montagu Mr Christopher Sheridan, who has been chief executive of Samuel Montagu for ten years, is to leave the merchant bank at the end of next month. He is to be replaced by Mr Keith Harris, a former Morgan Grenfell and Drexel Burnham Lambert merchant banker who is currently managing director of the corporate finance arm of Apax Partners, the venture capital group. HSBC, the Hong Kong and Shanghai banking group which acquired Samuel Montagu when it took over Midland Bank in 1992, said that Mr Sheridan was leaving by mutual agreement. The company said that Mr Sheridan, 51, was leaving the company 'at a successful point in its history' though it has had its share of problems in recent years. Last October it was ordered to pay Pounds 172m of damages and costs to British &amp; Commonwealth, the failed financial services group. It is also facing a Department of Trade and Industry inquiry into the flotation of Mirror Group Newspapers in 1991 in which the bank acted as adviser to Mr Robert Maxwell. Mr Harris, 41, started his career with Orion Bank, joining Morgan Grenfell in 1980 and moving to New York in 1985 to head its US operations. In 1988 he was appointed managing director of the international corporate finance arm of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the Wall Street investment bank that collapsed in 1990.</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: All-round growth at British Dredging Progress all round coupled with much higher net margins enabled British Dredging to raise pre-tax profits by 28 per cent from Pounds 578,000 to Pounds 739,000 in the first half of 1993. Turnover of the building materials, ship repairing and concrete products group, rose only 7 per cent to Pounds 17.35m. Mr Fane Vernon, chairman, said this increase was entirely due to the full six months' contribution from the 604 builders merchants business which was acquired in March 1992 and from Selco's Cardiff branch - opened in July 1992. Operating profits grew 83 per cent to Pounds 655,000. Net interest received was lower at Pounds 84,000 (Pounds 306,000) because of the group's investment in new branches of JT Edwards and Selco Trade Centres and reduced interest rates. Last time there was also an exceptional charge of Pounds 85,000. Earnings per share increased from 2.2p to 2.83p, while an unchanged interim dividend of 2.6p is declared.</p>

			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Work ailments cost up to Pounds 9bn a year Accidents and illness at work are costing employers between Pounds 4bn and Pounds 9bn a year, the equivalent of as much as 10 per cent of all UK industrial companies' trading profits, the Health and Safety Executive said yesterday. In a report based on the most comprehensive research the executive has undertaken in the field, it calculates that accidents and illness at work are costing the economy overall between Pounds 11bn and Pounds 16bn a year, between 2 per cent and 3 per cent of gross domestic product or a year's economic growth. The cost to employers, it says, is 30m lost working days, the equivalent of Pounds 360 for every working man and woman. In spite of the findings Mr Michael Forsyth, the employment minister, said yesterday that Britain's health and safety standards were the best in the world. 'Lots of red tape does not necessarily lead to a healthier and safer workplace,' he said. Yet union leaders believe that any de-regulation of health and safety could prove a false economy. Mr Frank Davies, chairman of the Health and Safety Commission, which oversees the executive, said the report proved that accidents hurt companies' balance sheets. 'I doubt if many managements understand what accidents actually cost,' he said. Most of the costs tended to be uninsured and hidden away on profit and loss accounts under production, insurance or labour costs or as write-offs. The report said the cost to employers included compensation to injured workers, replacing staff involved in an accident and repairing equipment. The findings were based upon figures in the Department of Employment's 1990 Labour Force Survey and case studies carried out by the executives' accident prevention advisory unit. The studies, which looked at non-injury as well as injury accidents and illnesses, centred upon a construction site, a creamery, a transport haulage company, a North Sea oil production platform and an National Health Service hospital. It found that the construction company lost Pounds 700,000 a year through accidents and ill health, the creamery almost Pounds 1m, the transport company Pounds 196,000, the hospital Pounds 400,000 and the oil production platform Pounds 3.7m. The report, based on figures from the 1989-1990 financial year, estimated that illness and injury led to the loss of 30m working days in a single year. About 1.6m injury accidents in the year had led to absence from work equivalent to 18m lost working days. Some 5,000 of those injured had to give up work permanently. The commission believes that as much as 70 per cent of the cost of accidents and ill health could be prevented by management. A group of Nottinghamshire Labour MPs are meeting with Mr Forsyth today in an attempt to have a public inquiry into the Bilsthorpe colliery accident that resulted in the deaths of three miners in August. The report of the Health and Safety Executive investigation into the accident is to be published today. Costs to the British Economy of Work Accidents.

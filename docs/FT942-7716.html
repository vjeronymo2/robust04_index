			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 275m provision warning in the air - USAir's financial problems overshadow 'impressive' BA results The acute financial problems of USAir yesterday overshadowed the announcement by British Airways of another set of impressive figures, including pre-tax profits of Pounds 301m in its latest financial year. In the worst case scenario, Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, conceded that BA may be forced to write-off its Pounds 275.3m investment in its 24.6 per cent stake in USAir, the sixth largest US carrier. However, he also said the partnership with USAir, a centrepiece in BA's strategy of global alliances, was bringing benefits through the ticket code-sharing agreement between the two carriers, the joint frequent flier programme and cost saving opportunities. These benefits totalled about Pounds 10m last year and were expected to rise to Pounds 70m this year. Even if USAir was forced to file under the US Chapter 11 bankruptcy rules, the code-sharing and other co-operative ventures between the two carriers would continue and so would the benefits from the increasing traffic feed from USAir's domestic services into BA's international network. However, should BA be forced to make heavy provisions to cover its USAir investment, it would represent a significant setback for the carrier, both financially and psychologically since it would raise fundamental questions about the UK carrier's ambitious global strategy. Sir Colin said USAir had been severely hit by increasing competition from low-cost, low-fare airlines in its principal market in the north-east of the US. USAir incurred losses of Dollars 196.7m (Pounds 131m) in its first quarter to March 31 1994 and the deficit for the whole year is now expected to exceed last year's Dollars 349.4m. The future of the airline now hinges on a restructuring programme aimed at eliminating Dollars 1bn of costs a year. Sir Colin explained that about Dollars 500m of the cost savings and revenue enhancement measures would come from USAir management actions including the quicker turnround of aircraft at airports. The other Dollars 500m savings would have to come from union concessions on work practices and salaries. Sir Colin said there was 'a sense of urgency' to reach these agreements with the unions during the next 90 days. He warned that if these negotiations were not successful then BA would have to make a provision on its USAir investment. If USAir were forced to file for Chapter 11, it would hit the current Pounds 16m to Pounds 18m BA earns in annual dividends from its preferred stock in USAir. So far, BA has been cushioned from USAir's financial problems because its 24.6 per cent stake in the US carrier involves preferred shares. BA sounded the first alarm bells about its USAir investment in March when it announced it would not make any additional investments in the airline until it had been reassured of the ongoing viability of the business. In contrast to the problems facing its investment, BA said yesterday that its partnerships with European airlines and Qantas of Australia were showing encouraging signs. Although both TAT, its French affiliate, and Deutsche BA, its German partner, continued to lose money last year, the two carriers were improving and would help strengthen BA's overall position in the newly-liberalised European aviation market. Qantas, for its part, was profitable and Sir Colin said he expected 'real benefits' from BA's 25 per cent stake in the Australian carrier due to be fully privatised over the next 13 months. However, should the USAir restructuring and recovery programme fail, BA risks being left with a gaping hole in its overall global airline strategy, since the US market still accounts for about 40 per cent of world air travel.</p>

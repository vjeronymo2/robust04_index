			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NCAA TOURNAMENT NOTES;  </P> <P> ILLINOIS PLAYER JUMPS TO THE DEFENSE OF HENSON  </P> <P> Illinois Coach Lou Henson has been criticized for his mediocre record in the  National Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament, but at least one of his players  think it is unjust.  </P> <P> At Friday's practice, Nick Anderson wore a T-shirt inscribed "Lou Can Do!" in  support of Henson.  </P> <P> "People have been down on him for so long, but Lou can do it," Anderson said.  "I think he's a good coach. I don't care what anybody else says."  </P> <P> Duke guard Quin Snyder signed autographs for 10 minutes as he was leaving the  Kingdome.  </P> <P> A hometown hero who grew up on Mercer Island, Snyder would have gotten writer's  cramp if a Duke official hadn't hurried him off.  </P> <P> The Blue Devils practiced at Mercer Island High, Snyder's old school, on  Thursday.  </P> <P> "Quin showed us his old locker and his prom pictures," quipped Duke Coach Mike  Krzyzewski.  </P> <P> Michigan forward Sean Higgins, a sophomore from Los Angeles, is an aspiring  sportscaster.  </P> <P> "I want to be another Dick Vitale," Higgins said. "Most games are boring unless  you have an exciting commentator. And maybe I could add some excitement to the  games."  </P> <P> Higgins was a no-show at a Dick Vitale sound-a-like contest held at a local  bar.  </P> <P> USC Coach George Raveling reportedly was contacted for the vacant head coaching  job at Washington, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported. Raveling, who has  two years remaining on his USC contract, was not interested.  </P> <P> Paul Westhead, Loyola Marymount coach, also was contacted by Washington, the  newspaper reported.  </P> <P> Injured Clipper rookie Danny Manning, who led Kansas to the 1988 NCAA title, is  here as a fan.  </P> <P> "Last year I didn't have much fun because we had a job to do." Manning said.  "I'm going to enjoy this."  </P> <P> Who dies Manning pick?  </P> <P> "I like Duke," said Manning, who scored 25 points as Kansas eliminated Duke,  66-59, in a semifinal game last season. "I think Duke has the experience  because they've been (in the Final Four) three of the last four years."  </P> <P> Danny Ferry, the Duke center, has grown tired of being compared to Manning.  </P> <P> "People have asked me if I'm this year's Danny Manning," Ferry said. "No, I'm  not Danny Manning. I'm Danny Ferry."  </P></p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM attacked over Iraq arms probe LABOUR yesterday accused Mr John Major of trying to 'bring down the shutters' on the arms-for-Iraq affair, as it launched its strongest attack yet on the government's refusal to answer questions on the subject. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade secretary, charged the prime minister with betraying promises made when the Scott inquiry was set up. Mr Cook's comments followed a written answer by Mr Major in which he turned down a request to make it government policy to give substantive replies to parliamentary questions on arms-for-Iraq.</p>

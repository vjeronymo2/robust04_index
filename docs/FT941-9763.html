			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Scottish Widows' bonus rates - At a glance Scottish Widows has announced its new bonus rates on with-profits policies for this year, largely in line with the pattern set by other big life insurance companies. The bonus rate on the sum assured has been cut from 3.5 to 3 per cent, while the bonus on existing bonuses is down to 5.5 per cent from 6 per cent. Terminal bonus rates have been improved for all maturities, after a good year for world stock markets. A 10-year endowment maturing on February 1, taken out by a man aged 29 paying Pounds 30 a month, is worth Pounds 6,651, up 0.5 per cent from Pounds 6,619 last year. A 25-year policy, on the same basis, would pay Pounds 61,479, up 4.6 per cent from Pounds 58,754 last year.</p>

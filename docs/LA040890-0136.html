			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> FEE TIED TO BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT IS A STEP TOWARD LOW-COST HOUSING  </P> <P> Almost 20 years ago in Irvine, the first committee on housing recommended that  there be affordable housing so that the people who worked in Irvine could  afford to live in the city. As a member of that committee, it seemed to me that  that was not an unreasonable expectation; however, even then there was  opposition from real estate interests. They were concerned that affordable  housing would interfere with their profit-making potential.  </P> <P> Since then we know what has happened. Driven by the marketplace, real estate  values have soared and huge profits have been made. At the same time, the city  has struggled to promote affordable housing, but the supply doesn't begin to  meet the demand. Today, only 12% of the people who work in Irvine live in  Irvine. The remaining 88% waste hours of time on our congested freeways and  contribute to the smog that threatens the health of each of us.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, projections for commercial and industrial development indicate that  over 3 million square feet will be built each year until 2010. This amount of  space translates to about 9,000 new employees, or more than 5,600 new  households, with as many as 30% of them possibly qualifying for low-income  housing. (Currently, a family of four must have an annual income under $37,500  a year to qualify, which, according to the 1980 census, would make 60% of  Irvine employees eligible.)  </P> <P> The city is attempting to deal with this almost-certain shortage by planning  now.  </P> <P> Mandated by the State Housing Element law to provide decent housing for all  income groups and to project what housing needs are anticipated, the City  Council adopted a plan setting as a minimum goal that 25% of all housing built  in Irvine be affordable to low-wage earners. Various sources of funding will be  considered, such as federal and state grants and loans, tax credits to  builders, tax-exempt revenue bonds, and something new, called a housing trust  fund.  </P> <P> The housing trust fund monies will be loaned or granted to low-income housing  projects for such uses as down payment loans, on-site costs and school fees.  One benefit of the trust fund is that it will have more stability than grants  or loans that require renewal and depend on a particular political climate. The  council is considering funding this trust fund by assessing a fee on the square  footage of all new commercial and industrial development. (The fee is called a  linkage fee because it is linked to the number of jobs created and resulting  employees requiring low-income housing in Irvine.)  </P> <P> The City Council created a 15-member committee representing a diversity of  interests, including developers and low-income housing advocates, and charged  them to recommend an appropriate linkage fee. As a member of the committee and  a low-income housing advocate, I am satisfied with our recommendations of $3 to  $5.50 a square foot, depending on the type of development, although I had hoped  for something higher.  </P> <P> It was not easy to reach these numbers. We waded through studies and ordinances  on linkage fees enacted in other cities, such as San Diego, Sacramento, Menlo  Park and in Santa Barbara County. We hired firms to conduct studies on the  linkages between construction of residential buildings and the demand for  housing affordable to lower-income groups in Irvine, and on the affordability  gap between Irvine's housing costs and what low-income people here can afford  to pay. In addition to the consultants, we had excellent assistance from the  city staff. We never achieved consensus, and it was the developers and real  estate interests who won the majority opinion that was submitted to the City  Council.  </P> <P> Thus, it is with amazement that I listened to the frantic protests of the  builders and developers when our report was submitted to the council. Despite  the numerical data provided by the consultants and common sense, the building  interests questioned whether a linkage could be established between new jobs  created and the need for additional housing. Perhaps there are some factors  other than job location that create demand, but given a choice, I'm certain  that most workers would choose to live near their place of work. Common sense  couldn't have it any other way.  </P> <P> Also questioned was the empirical data because the information regarding the  size of households and increased labor participation from second-income wage  earners was based on 1980 census material. Had we the time or money to collect  more recent data, it is doubtful that the results would have been significantly  different. Data regarding the number of low-income wage earners for each  occupational grouping and the number of workers per 100,000 square feet in  various industries was more recent, as was the salary data for each occupation.  </P> <P> The protesters, of course, complained that the fees would make building in  Irvine prohibitive, and that developers would be forced to go elsewhere.  However, according to the nexus study, the fees represent less than 3% of the  total building cost and our consultants advised us that any fee below 5% would  have little impact and would not redirect development.  </P> <P> I have a background in business and I understand the necessity of profit and  the importance of a return on investment. But I also know that less profit and  less return is expected with lower risk. Irvine, with its proximity to the  university and the airport, with its beautifully planned communities, excellent  schools and relatively clean air, is not a high-risk area for developers. I am  certain that development will continue regardless of the linkage fee.  </P> <P> Furthermore, companies should find Irvine even more attractive when they  realize that there is some promise of a diversified labor pool within the city  and that their workers will not have to commute to Riverside or Corona in order  to find affordable housing.  </P> <P> The controversy is no different than the situation 20 years ago. Real estate  interests are afraid that efforts to provide low-income housing will cut into  their profits. Profit is the American way, and private enterprise could not  exist without a profit motive, but it is also the American way to provide  healthy, economically viable communities for all of our citizens.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, this proposed rule change will simplify the procedures by eliminating the processing and retention fee practice set forth in existing &sect;&sect;1.53(d) and 1.78(a)(1). The processing and retention fee practice allows applicants to file an application without the filing fee and to pay the processing and retention fee of $130.00 in order for the application to be used as a basis for foreign filing and for priority under 35 U.S.C. 120. The processing and retention fee practice is seldom used and will be unnecessary in view of the legislation which provides for the filing of a provisional application with a filing fee of $150.00/$75.00. The result achieved by the use of the processing and retention fee practice can be achieved by the use of the provisional application practice at about the same fee level. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to simplify the procedures for filing continuation and divisional applications, it is proposed that &sect;1.60 be deleted. The procedures set forth in &sect;1.60 are unnecessary in view of the recent rule change to &sect;1.6(d) which permits the filing of a copy of an oath or declaration. Applicants may use the procedures set forth in &sect;1.53 to file a continuation or divisional application under 35 U.S.C. 111(a), as contained in S. 2467 and H.R. 5110, by providing the Office with a copy of the prior application as filed. The issue of a stale oath or declaration would be eliminated by amending Office practice since neither the statute nor the rules require a recent date of execution to appear on the oath or declaration. The subject matter of the application would have been executed by the inventor(s) and the duty of candor and good faith including the duty of disclosure requirements of &sect;1.56 would be continuous and would apply to the continuing application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Clarifying amendments are proposed to be made to &sect;&sect;1.16, paragraphs (a) and (f); and 1.17, paragraphs (h) and (i). These proposed amendments do not affect the substance of the rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fees set forth in current &sect;1.17, paragraphs (i)(1) and (i)(2), are proposed to be consolidated into a new paragraph (i). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Specific Rules <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If Title 37 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 1 and 3, are amended as proposed: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.1 would provide a special ``Box Provisional Patent Application'' address to assist the Mail Room in separating and processing provisional applications and mail relating thereto. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.9 would have current paragraph (a) redesignated as subparagraph (a)(1). A new subparagraph (a)(2) would be added to define the term ``provisional application'' as a U.S. national application filed under 35 U.S.C. 111(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections 1.12 and 1.14 would have the reference to 37 CFR 1.17(i)(1) replaced with a reference to 37 CFR 1.17(i) because it is proposed that 37 CFR 1.17(i)(1) and (i)(2) be consolidated into a new paragraph (i) since the petition fees provided in existing paragraphs (i)(1) and (i)(2) are the same. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.16 would list the basic filing fee for a provisional application as $75.00 for a small entity (see &sect;1.19(c)&hyph;(f)) or $150.00 for other than a small entity as contained in S. 2467 and H.R. 5110. Since the filing fee for a provisional application is established by S. 2467 and H.R. 5110 as a 35 U.S.C. 41(a) fee, the filing fee for a provisional application will be subject to the 50 percent reduction provided for in 35 U.S.C. 41(h). A complete provisional application does not require claims since no examination on the merits will be given to a provisional application. However, provisional applications may be filed with one or more claims as part of the application. Nevertheless, no additional claim fee or multiple dependent claim fee will be required in a provisional application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, proposed &sect;1.16 paragraph (l), would establish the surcharge required by proposed &sect;1.53(d)(2) for filing the basic filing fee or the cover sheet required by proposed &sect;1.51(a)(2) for a provisional application at a time later than the provisional application filing date as $25.00 for a small entity or $50.00 for other than a small entity. The $50.00/$25.00 surcharge set forth in proposed paragraph (1) for a provisional application is less than the $130.00/$65.00 surcharge set forth in paragraph (e) for all other types of patent applications. A reduced surcharge for a provisional application is proposed in view of the lower filing fee required for a provisional application and in an attempt to minimize applicant's overall cost of filing a provisional application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Clarifying changes would be made to &sect;1.16. These changes do not affect the substance of the rule. It is proposed to insert the words ``basic fee'' in paragraph (f) of &sect;1.16. Paragraph (e) currently refers to ``the basic filing fee''. Current Office practice allows a design application to be filed without the design filing fee or the oath/declaration as set forth in current &sect;1.53(d). The change to &sect;1.16(f) is merely for clarification. In addition, it is proposed to replace the word ``cases'' found in paragraph (a) with the word ``applications'', since the word ``applications'' is used elsewhere in the rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.17 would amend paragraph (h) to provide that the $130.00 petition fee for filing a petition for correction of inventorship under 37 CFR 1.48 applies to all patent applications, except provisional applications which would be covered by new paragraph (q). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

This account led to the  conclusion that a gigantic and fruitful effort had been made,  which shows that the capabilities and combat readiness of our  Armed Forces have been strengthened.    Another important point analyzed was the FAR's  [Revolutionary  Armed Forces] agricultural-livestock activity toward the goal of  supplying all the troops with food; a 30-percent increase toward  achieving this objective is expected this year.    During the Minfar's expanded military council, on the  occasion of his 50th anniversary as a combat pilot, Enrique  Carrera [last name as heard], hero of the Republic of Cuba, was  promoted to the rank of division general.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Turkey will allot a 35 million dollar-credit for  development of Gagauzia. President of the self-proclaimed  Gagauz Republic Stepan Topal told Interfax in an interview on  the results of the visit of Turkish President Suleyman Demirel  that 32 million would be utilized for supply of the region with  drinking water and 3 million would go for development of the  infrastructure.    Topal hoped that the problem concerning the political status  of the southern Moldovan region mostly populated by Gagauz,  would be resolved in the near future. He suggested that this  would help to stabilize the social-political situation in the  region and to attract foreing investments.    Commenting on relations with the Transdniestrian leadership,  Topal said they remained the same and were proceeding from the  treaty on friendship and cooperation signed in 1992.    The fact that Gagauzia seeks cooperation with Turkey rather  than with Transdniestria cannot hinder our relations. "Together  with Transdnietsria we have stood for preservation of the USSR  and we will not refuse from cooperation with the ex-Soviet  republics, primarily with Russia," Topal pointed out.</p>

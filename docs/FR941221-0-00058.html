			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters requested that the final rule on subtitle D  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require approval by HUD before an owner may make the election of occupancy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preferences authorized by subtitle D. The commenters stated that HUD approval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of an owner's election is the only effective and available means to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that an owner is not improperly applying the provisions of subtitle D to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discriminate against persons with disabilities under the age of 62. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters stated that if HUD declined to adopt this suggestion, then, at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least, the final rule should require owners to report to HUD the election of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an elderly preference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD believes that to require an owner to seek approval by HUD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before making the election of occupancy preferences authorized by subtitle D  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is without statutory support and is not consistent with Congressional intent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed earlier in this preamble, subtitle B of title VI of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1992 HCD Act provides PHAs with the option to designate a public housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project or portion of a project for occupancy by elderly families, disabled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> families, or elderly families and disabled families. Subtitle B further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides that before one of these three designations can be made, a PHA must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtain the approval of HUD through the submission of an allocation plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, for subtitle B housing, Congress explicitly requires prior HUD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval. There is no comparable provision, however, in subtitle D. HUD does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not believe that this was an oversight on the part of the Congress, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflects clear Congressional intent that the election of occupancy preferences  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under subtitle B (``designation'' as it is referred to in subtitle B) would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require prior HUD approval, and the election of preferences under subtitle D  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to reporting the election of preference by the owner, HUD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has determined that this reporting requirement is not necessary. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable Section 8 regulations provide for periodic reviews of section 8  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing projects to determine contract compliance. The regulations in parts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 880, 881 and 883 require annual reviews by the contract administrator (see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;&sect;880.612 and 881.612, 883.713), and the regulations in parts 884 and 886  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require review by HUD at such intervals as deemed necessary to ensure that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner is in full compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract. At  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the time of this review, the contract administrator or HUD, as the case may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be, will identify those owners who have made an election of occupancy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preference under subtitle D. HUD will revise its form that is used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management reviews to include identification of those projects which have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elected the elderly preference authorized by subtitle D. Additionally, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviewing occupancy procedures, the contract administrator will consider the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation of the title VI occupancy preferences along with other occupancy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures. Finally, HUD's review of an owner's decision to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preferences may also arise in connection with HUD civil rights complaint  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigations under the Fair Housing Act, or compliance reviews and complaint  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigations under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended, or other applicable civil rights statutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter requested that the final rule exempt accessible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units from the covered section 8 units subject to the elderly preference. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter stated that at the very least these units should be rented only to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those persons with disabilities who are near-elderly and elderly and who need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the accessibility features of particular units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There is no basis in subtitle D for HUD to exempt accessible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units from covered section 8 units subject to the elderly preference, nor is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there a need for HUD to do so. In accordance with section 504 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and HUD's implementing regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in 24 CFR part 8, as well as the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD's implementing regulations in 24 CFR part 100, reasonable accommodations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be made for the needs of persons with disabilities who need an accessible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit. The housing provider is to accommodate the person either by (1) making  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an available inaccessible unit accessible (so long as doing so would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the program or activity or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undue financial and administrative burdens), or (2) by transferring a tenant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who is living in an accessible unit but does not need an accessible unit to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the inaccessible unit, and offering the accessible unit to the disabled family  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (24 CFR 8.27). However, as discussed in the preamble to the May 3, 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interim rule, an owner who has made the election of occupancy preference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorized by subtitle D and who is selecting tenants from the waiting list,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can (where it is an elderly family's turn for admission because the reserve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement, if any, has been met) give an elderly family who needs an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accessible unit a preference over a non-elderly disabled family who also needs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the accessible unit. Once the reserve requirement, if any, for disabled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> families has been met, the owner can also give the accessible unit to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elderly family who does not need the accessibility features of the unit even  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if a non-elderly disabled family has also applied for the unit. HUD points  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out that once the reserve requirement, if any, for disabled families has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> met, the owner can give the unit to an elderly family who does not need the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accessibility features of the unit only if there is no elderly family who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needs the accessibility features of the unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that the final rule should ``grandfather- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in'' all non-elderly persons with disabilities on the project waiting lists as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of June 2, 1994, the effective date of the interim rule, and prohibit a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project owner from passing over these persons when selecting tenants from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waiting lists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The statute provides no authority for HUD to adopt this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision; to the contrary, by its plain language, the statute authorizes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediate implementation of the preferences and the set aside. Existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents are protected in the event that current occupancy of non-elderly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> families with disabilities exceeds the percentage of units under the set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aside. As noted later in this preamble, however, owners of covered section 8  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projects who make the election are prohibited from removing non-elderly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> persons with disabilities from the projects' waiting lists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (13): A reversal of strategy - Hopes will now be pinned on an improvement in competitiveness / United Kingdom IN BRITAIN a summer of discontent on the economic front has now ended in tears. After nearly a month of struggling to hold the pound within the ERM, through massive intervention in the foreign exchange markets, the government has been forced to abandon this cornerstone of its economic policy. The devaluation option, scorned less than two weeks ago by the prime minister, John Major, has now, in effect, had to be adopted, leaving the government to construct a wholly new economic policy. Yet, even with a new lower exchange rate, interest rate policy is likely to be constrained by the need to maintain the fight against inflation. As a result prospects for recovery from the longest peacetime recession since the 1930s look relatively unpromising. There is a big question mark over whether Britain will, as it says it wants to, re-enter the ERM, when market conditions look more settled, or whether it will return to a policy of letting the pound float. To many economists, prospects appeared completely different four months ago, shortly after the Conservatives' surprise victory in the April 9 general election. Economic indicators were turning up, and the end to the recession which began around mid-1990 seemed not far away. But this mood did not last long. Last month a survey by the Treasury showed the median view of the economics profession was for the economy to contract this year by 0.6 per cent, followed by a 1.6 per cent growth in 1993. The strain on the pound of the UK's weak economic performance has in the end proved irresistible with a small cut in German interest rates, accompanied by a devaluation of the Italian lira in mid-September, proving insufficient to turn away the attentions of speculators convinced that sterling was overvalued. The gloom had already been underlined when Professor Douglas McWilliams, economic adviser to the Confederation of British Industry, predicted in August that Britain faced four more quarters of contraction, with recovery delayed until 1994. Coming from a man who has been optimistic about an upturn - and whose views carry a lot of weight - Prof McWilliams's remarks added to the foreboding. Some might argue that it is when such bleak views are being expressed that the economy is ripe for an upturn. According to this sentiment the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares - which between election day and the beginning of September has come off by 10 per cent as pessimism for business prospects has set in - should soon start to rebound. Indeed, late last week, with the first signs that the period of uncertainty might be coming to an end, the index put in a sustained rally. Less than propitious trends remain, however, within the UK economy: Bank base rates, although quickly restored to 10 per cent after a temporary rise last week to 12 per cent (and a threatened 15 per cent) in a last desperate bid to save the ERM valuation remain extremely high for a country struggling to climb out of recession. While the German Bundesbank maintains its present level of interest rates - which remain high in spite of last week's actions - Britain's potential to ease borrowing costs will remain small. Consumer demand, which accounts for two thirds of GDP, remains low. This is partly because of the high overhang of consumer debt, especially mortgages, resulting from heavy borrowing during the late 1980s' economic boom. Consumer spending has fallen 3.5 per cent since mid-1990, while during the last recession in 1980-81 it fell less than 2 per cent. After a 25 per cent fall in some regions of Britain in house prices over the past four years, the housing market remains weak, with few signs of an upturn. According to the Bank of England, up to 1m mortgage holders, or 10 per cent of the total, have a mortgage bigger than the value of their home. The slump in the housing market has hit particularly hard sales of big-ticket consumer goods such as refrigerators and cookers. While manufacturing output has shown small growth in each of the first two quarters of this year, providing some chink of light for the economy, prospects for the rest of 1992 do not look particularly good. Britain's ability to inject more demand into the economy by easing fiscal policy is diminished by its rapidly rising public sector borrowing requirement, which looks like climbing to above Pounds 30bn this financial year after a PSBR of Pounds 14bn in 1991-92 and a small surplus in the previous year. Nonetheless the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a leading economics think tank, thinks the government might have scope for some small measure of tax cuts or extra public spending to help a recovery, adding up to a fiscal injection of some Pounds 2bn over the next year. Amid the gloom, what are the more positive elements? A fall in the value of sterling against other European currencies, and in particular the D-Mark, will help exports to EC partners. The prospects of companies exporting to the US, will also have been improved . Against this, the Treasury's previous strategy of pinning hopes for better times on the large falls in inflation will have become much more problematic with devaluation inevitably increasing inflationary pressures over the medium term. To date, headline inflation, as measured by the retail prices index, has fallen from nearly 11 per cent at the end of 1990 to below 4 per cent in August, while the underlying year-on-year increase in average earnings across the economy has come down over the same period from 9.75 per cent to 6 per cent in July. In manufacturing, largely because of the heavy falls in employment during the past two years, productivity rises have been fairly healthy, giving some hopes of a good platform for future industrial expansion. Put alongside productivity increases, however, are the large falls in factory investment during the recession. This has made some observers pessimistic about the chances of the UK's manufacturers being able to compete strongly over the next few years with overseas rivals, particularly in important capital intensive areas such as electronics, cars and production equipment.</p>

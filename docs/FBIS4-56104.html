			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Czech President Vaclav Havel will visit  Bratislava on 26 May as one of three meetings that he and Slovak  President Michal Kovac have agreed to hold annually. Before his  visit he gave an interview to Slovak Radio Prague correspondent  Daniela Galikova.    [Begin recording] [Galikova] Do you think there has been a  qualitative shift in Czech-Slovak relations since the split of  the Czechoslovak Federation?    [Havel] Shortly after the split some problems were very  sensitive, burning, and painful. Much was written about them,  and excessive emphasis was placed on their political aspect. My  view is that they have probably been transformed into more  matter-of-fact issues. [passage omitted]    [Galikova] The new Slovak cabinet has been in office for  over  a month now. It is generally being perceived as the cabinet  that has contributed to calming down the Slovak political scene.  Do you think that now is the right time to discuss the issues  pertaining to Czech-Slovak relations that remain unsolved,  especially considering (?very tense relations) with the current  Slovak opposition?    [Havel] My view is that we are not in a hurry. It would be  damaging if any hurried solution to those issues that remain  open were to interfere with the pre-election situation in  Slovakia or cause any unnecessary polarization. For various  reasons I do not think that it would be a good thing if  something that might be called the Czech card were to play a  role in the Slovak elections. This would not be good. That is  why I think it is better to work calmly and to make certain  preparations. Once agreements are ripe for being concluded, we  can conclude them. However, taking the elections into account,  I do not think it would be good to hurry anything. [end  recording]</p>

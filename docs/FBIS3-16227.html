The poll showed that 13.9 percent of families live on  earlier  savings, 14.9 percent have enough money but 0.7 percent are  amply provided.    In total, 81 percent of families face serious money  hardships.    Sixty-eight percent of respondents reported unable to save  in  the present conditions. Almost two-thirds of the interviewed  said they could not make valuable purchases and would not be  able to do it in the next twelve months, either.    The economic standing of families became worse between 1992  and 1993, say the majority of respondents. Only 0.6 percent of  families said they enjoyed an improvement in their material  situation last year.    In addition, the families criticize the changes in the  Latvian economic situation in 1993. Sixty-one percent of  families say the economic situation became worse during the past  year while 7.5 percent say the economic situation improved.    The poll interviewed 1,298 families. From those, 56 percent  were urban dwellers and 46 percent lived in the countryside.  The poll was aimed at studying the public opinion on the latest  material welfare and economic situation changes in families.</p>

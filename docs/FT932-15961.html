			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / John Major's Year: What industry says about him in the boardroom - 'A committed European . . . a man with no vision . . . calm and far-sighted . . . unable to promote a feeling of confidence . . .' TWELVE months after most of the business community welcomed the unexpected return of a Conservative government, company executives give their verdict on the performance of Mr John Major. Mr David Thompson, managing director of Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Breweries: 'I give John Major a plus for sticking by Norman Lamont. I think the cautious approach adopted in the Budget showed a realistic appreciation of the situation.' Mr Chris Haskins, chairman of Northern Foods: 'His greatest strength is that he replaced Mrs Thatcher. His greatest weakness is that he doesn't appear to have an intellectual reason for what he's doing.' Mr Maurice Warren, chairman of Dalgety: 'He is a committed European. That is terribly important to British business. His greatest weakness is not appearing as a strong leader. The tremendous difficulties caused by the Maastricht rebels are creating a significant risk for business by having Britain sit on the sidelines of Europe.' Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey: 'His greatest strengths have been his commitment to low inflation and his willingness to listen to views from outside. Our concern is that he has so far been unable to promote any general feeling of confidence.' Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman and chief executive of Grand Metropolitan: 'It's been an extremely tough year for the world economy. Throughout this difficult period, the prime minister has shown himself to be remarkably calm and far-sighted.' Mr Neil Johnson, director-general of the Engineering Employers' Federation: 'His greatest strength is his willingness to listen to manufacturing industry and to accept that manufacturing holds the key to this country's economic success. His weakness is not persuading enough of his cabinet colleagues of the need for this country to have an industrial strategy.' Sir Neville Bowman-Shaw, chairman of Lancer Boss: 'John Major will be proved to be one of the best overall prime ministers. He has a good economic policy and has stood up well to critics. The best thing John Major has done is to pull out of the ERM.' Mr Peter Bonfield, chairman and chief executive of ICL: 'What we need from Major are stable government policies and a stable currency in addition to low inflation. Add to that a successful conclusion to the Gatt talks and to the Maastricht debate.' Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons: 'He is approachable, resistant to pressure, and determined. The best thing he has done is to win the election.' Mr Ken Morrison, chairman of Wm Morrison: 'I'd like to see him do anything that makes us more competitive. We seem to have lost the edge.' Mr Trevor Osborne of Speyhawk, technically insolvent property company: 'He appears to listen. His weakness is that he has failed sufficiently to identify a vision and articulate it to the nation.' Mr Richard Gamble, chief executive of Royal Insurance: 'He is a straightforward guy. Realistic not dogmatic. The single most important thing he has done for business is relieved us of the constraints of the ERM.' Mr Geoffrey Whalen, chief executive of Peugeot Talbot: 'Through all the country's difficulties I've never heard anyone describe him as other than someone who displays kindness, consideration and who treats people properly.'</p>

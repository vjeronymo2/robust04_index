			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Spare the public spending axe The UK male unemployment percentage to be announced today is likely to exceed the peak reached in the 1980s. Nor is there any sign of a let-up. The plain man may think it madness to cut spending on needed road, rail and other infrastructure improvements, or to dismiss public employees at a time like this. The plain man would be largely right. This will all be done so that the Treasury can say that its Planning Total of Pounds 244.5bn for 1993-94 has not been breached. The published total will be less than that because of a definitional shift to a new spending aggregate known as the Control Total, which will exclude recession-sensitive social security payments. Keynes pointed out in the 1920s the absurdity of unmet wants and unemployed workers side by side. But if we are to make use of the obvious insights of Keynes, we have to remember what went wrong with the way of thinking which bears his name. 1. Above all there was the neglect of inflation. Governments can only sensibly maintain spending in money terms. If they try to spend themselves into full employment, irrespective of the effect on pay and prices, they will only let loose accelerating inflation without creating any sustainable jobs. How big a short-term inflationary setback has been inflicted by Black Wednesday is highly debatable. Whatever the magnitude, it means so much more inflation and so much less output and jobs, given a coherent policy to maintain the growth of total spending ('nominal GDP') at a sustainable rate of, say, 5 per cent a year - an aim which ought to be common ground, even though it was not mentioned in the chancellor's letter to the Treasury committee. Public spending programmes, expressed in cash, can be a legitimate part of policies to maintain non-inflationary demand growth, even though they will be less successful outside the ERM. 2. The next argument is the anti-fine-tuning one. Public works commissioned in a recession are likely to boost demand pressures in the next boom. This argument had its greatest force during the four or five-year cycles characteristic of the period up to the 1970s. Measuring from trough to trough, the latest cycle has so far lasted 11 years and could last longer. With longer cycles characterised by periods of consumer over-indebtedness and reluctance to spend, it makes eminent sense for public expenditure to make up the private gap. 3. The most valid argument for keeping a close watch on public spending at all times is the ratchet effect. The public spending ratio rises in a recession and under Labour governments, but is slow to fall afterwards. This would make me, other things being equal, prefer tax cuts to public spending boosts. But we cannot ignore the fact that taxpayers are in a saving mood, or that tax cuts would be unacceptable in the prevalent hair-shirt mood. 4. The most high-brow argument for public spending curbs is the debt trap one. Beyond a certain point more and more government borrowing is required simply to pay the interest on previous borrowing until financial solvency is threatened, as in Italy. This is an argument for a nearly balanced budget, in years of normal business, not for curbing spending at the wrong time. The wrong way to avoid the debt trap is to raise taxes in a recession. The insidious long- term effect is to raise the revenue base and reinforce the ratchet toward ever higher public spending. It is astonishing that the 1981 budget, which did just that, should be eulogised by Thatcherites who claim to be against big government. It is also astonishing that people who claim to be monetarists should depend on fiscal policy, of all things, to check inflation. Many of my readers will be waiting to hear more of the distinction between capital and current government spending: 'Up to a point, Lord Copper.' For the profitability test is either absent or much less clear in public sector investment. I come back to my old example that expenditure on school lavatories counts as capital expenditure, while expenditure on more science teachers counts as current. Despite all these difficulties, there is a case for a capital budget, if only to sell a borrowing programme to the financial markets and persuade people who live by symbols that the government is not on a rake's progress. Updating the Treasury's own estimate of the capital element in total public expenditure gives one some Pounds 35bn to Pounds 40bn in 1993-94, about the same size as the likely borrowing requirement. To my mind, however, the more important distinction is not between current and capital expenditure, but between expenditure that puts people and capital equipment to work and that which is dissipated in pay and price increases. The biggest scope for radical action is in the 30 per cent of public spending devoted to pay and the 23 per cent to the direct purchase of goods and services. It is reasonable to ask public-sector employees to accept a freeze on average pay per head, so that more of them can be kept in employment. It is reasonable to impose a price ceiling on bought-in supplies and contracts. This is not a call for an incomes policy but a call to manage the public sector in terms of cash and with an eye to employment. The strongest defence the Treasury can make is that it is not really squeezing public spending, but attempting to keep aggregate spending plans to original intentions, which provided for a real increase of 4 per cent. I would reply that circumstances are sufficiently exceptional to allow departments to continue with programmes previously cleared by the Treasury even if the cumulative total is too high. Moreover, the recession allowance in the new Control Total is a very narrowly defined one, and excludes, for instance, effects on the ability of the private sector to contribute to infrastructure projects. Behind it all, ministers are hung up on the Treasury belief that curbing public borrowing will allow interest rates to fall. This may well be mythical - like the black cat in the dark room. Interest rates are largely determined by international movements and exchange rate expectations. The Treasury does not have the ability to deliver the interest rate reductions that Tory backbenchers stridently demand; and no purpose is served by pretending that they can be by spending curbs which merely put people out of work.  ------------------------------------------           GENERAL GOVT EXPENDITURE             'Percent breakdown)  ------------------------------------------ Transfers/grants              34.2 Pay                           30.5 Goods and services            23.1 Interest adjustments          12.2  ------------------------------------------ Sources: Treasury  ------------------------------------------</p>

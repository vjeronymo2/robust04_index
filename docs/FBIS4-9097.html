			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speakers identified by caption] </F>   [Text] After a three-hour debate on the annual report by  the National Broadcasting and Television Council [KRRiT], the  Sejm Culture Commission decided it would not decide today on  whether or not to approve it. The deputies decided they would  do this only after the constitutional tribunal has ruled whether  the president is entitled to dismiss the chairman of the  council. The deputies did not clarify if the approval of the  report would depend on whether the post was held by Marek  Markiewicz or Ryszard Bender.    [Zofia Kedziora] It is a total disaster, complained SLD  [Democratic Left Alliance] Deputy Izabella Sierakowska about  public television. She asked members of the council how they  appraised their decision to appoint as head of public television  Wieslaw Walendziak, who, according to the deputy's perception,  was to have been a wunderkind of the council.    [Deputy Izabella Sierakowska] I must say with regret that  this child of yours has not been a success at all.    [Marek Markiewicz, KRRiT] I do not know, I do not feel too  comfortable in the area of obstetrics. I find it hard to say  whether the child, in the form of Chairman Walendziak, has been  a success, especially in the third month since its birth.    [Kedziora] Marek Markiewicz believes that it will be  possible  to appraise the television only after some time, once the  effects of the recent transformations become visible.    Deputy Jerzy Wuttke accused the council of making PolSat a  monopolist by awarding it the franchise. This is contrary to  legislation. Before the council members replied, Deputy  Wenderlich from the SLD asked whether the view expressed by the  preceding speaker had been his own, that of the BBWR [Non-Party  Bloc in Support of Reforms], or the Belweder's.    [Deputy Jerzy Wenderlich] This occurred to me when Deputy  Wuttke said with apparent regret that the president's positive  role was to all intents and purposes mentioned in only one  sentence.    [Kedziora] According to Marek Markiewicz, for the moment,  the  only monopolist is public television, and only a national  station can compete with it.    [Ryszard Miazek, KRRiT] We face the question whether Polish  television is going to be private Polish television or Italian,  German, British, or American. We replied as we have: We are  building Polish private television--weak at the moment, but it  is going to grow alongside Polish capitalism.    [Kedziora] It can be expected that the commission is going  to  examine the council report in late May or early June.</p>

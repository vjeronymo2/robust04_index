			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / UN move on Yugoslav war crimes THE UN Security Council last night voted unanimously to establish a commission to investigate charges of mass killings and other war crimes, including the campaign of so-called 'ethnic cleansing', in former Yugoslavia. The resolution is directed particularly at Serb actions in Bosnia-Hercegovina and could lead to trials by an international tribunal, as recommended in a UN human rights report. However, no immediate provision for this has been made, prompting Mr Muhamed Sacirbey, the Bosnian delegate, to criticise the resolution for not going far enough. Other delegates, however, saw the action as the start of a process to bring to justice what one called those responsible for 'blind slaughter and barbarism'. The human rights group, Helsinki Watch, the Conference on Security Co-operation in Europe and other sources have reported serious violations, including mass executions, in Serb-run concentration camps in Bosnia. In a related action yesterday, the Security Council authorised UN troops to assume responsibility for demilitarising the Preklava peninsula on the Adriatic sea, by removing heavy weapons from neighbouring areas of Croatia and Montenegro and to ensure control of the Peruca Dam, which ethnic Serb forces consider to be under their command. Later today or tomorrow, the council is expected to turn to yet another resolution, establishing a no-fly zone for combat aircraft in Bosnia - but without any immediate provision for enforcement. That could come in a later council decision, but probably not until the UN force has been greatly strengthened by the addition of some 5,000 European and Canadian troops. In Geneva yesterday, Bosnia's rebel Serb faction said it was prepared to suspend all its military flights over the country in a move which would make a no-fly zone unnecessary. If the no-fly zone went ahead, the militant Serbs said they would walk out of the Geneva peace talks. While the US favoured using fighter aircraft to enforce a no-fly order against the Serbs, Britain and France feared this could place UN peace-keepers at grave risk as they escorted humanitarian aid convoys. Air and land convoys to Bosnia are meeting less than one-third of the urgent food needs there, the UN refugee agency said yesterday, Reuter reports from Geneva. 'We are not short of food. What we are short of is an ability to deliver it,' said Ms Sylvana Foa, for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. A minimum of 6,000 metric tonnes of food were needed every week in Bosnia, she said. But the present capacity fell far short of this target, leaving relief workers unable to even begin a programme to prepare for winter.</p>

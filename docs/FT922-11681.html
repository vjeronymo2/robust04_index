			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Vickers sees Rolls-Royce sale recede VICKERS, the UK engineering group, said yesterday that offers received for its troubled Rolls-Royce Motor Cars subsidiary had been too low, in spite of discussions with potential purchasers which had ranged 'far and wide'. Sir David Plastow, chairman and chief executive, told shareholders that the range of valuations put upon the business by others 'does not match the long-term value which we think Rolls-Royce Motor Cars has to Vickers shareholders'. The receding prospect of an early sale of the heavily lossmaking luxury car operations depressed the Vickers share price which closed 10p lower at 154p. Several shareholders pleaded with Sir David at the group's annual meeting yesterday to keep the car operations in British ownership. 'My 90-year-old mother chased me to this meeting,' said one. 'She is absolutely horrified that the company could be sold to the Japanese or the Germans. There is much more to this than just a business deal.' Sir David, who retires at the end of May, said the Vickers board had considered 'the options for the car business in the best long-term interests of shareholders'. It had held 'exploratory discussions with a number of international companies' but Sir David claimed that 'many people think they understand the Rolls-Royce Motor Cars business but few do'. After the shareholders meeting, he said 'it could be that it is not for sale. That might be the conclusion that we are coming to.' While Rolls-Royce was having 'a difficult time in its market place, the company is most definitely not in permanent decline', he told shareholders. Mr Peter Ward, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars chairman and chief executive, said the car operations would reach break-even on a monthly trading basis during the final months of the year. Sir David forecast that worldwide Rolls-Royce/Bentley sales in 1992 would be 'at similar levels' to last year. Sales in 1991 plunged 48.3 per cent to 1,723 - the lowest level since 1968 - from the record 3,333 achieved in 1990. In the first quarter of this year, UK sales of 109 were 47.8 per cent lower than a year ago, while sales in Japan fell from 179 to 58. In the US, sales recovered to 94 from 76 a year earlier.</p>

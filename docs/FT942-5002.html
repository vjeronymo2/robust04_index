			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Observer: Buttered guns Talking of the arms business, is the British government once again about to turn to British Aerospace, Britain's biggest arms exporter, to find its top arms salesman? Sir Colin Chandler was BAe's marketing director when he was poached to head the Ministry of Defence's Export Sales Organisation in 1985. Now another BAe type, Charles Masefield, 54, is being fingered to do the job. His dad, Sir Peter Masefield, used to be a big wheel in the British aviation industry, which helps in a business where names matter. Masefield junior is also an ex-chief test pilot for Hawker Siddeley; so at least he should know what he's talking about on the hardware side. It's certainly taken long enough to find a boss for one of Britain's most successful export businesses. One reason may be that the MoD insists on having a Brit. But if an Australian - Malcolm McIntosh - can be chief of defence procurement, surely an out-and-out foreigner could be Britain's chief arms sales rep? It would certainly widen the field and reduce the suspicion that the job will be stitched up over a few brandies and cigars at the Athenaeum.</p>

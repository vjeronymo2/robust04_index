			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GATES OFF HOOK IN SUIT; COUNTY TO PAY $616,000;  </P> <P> JUDGMENT: RITTER BROTHERS DROP ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN PUNITIVE DAMAGES FROM SHERIFF  IN GUN-PERMIT CASE.  </P> <P> Two private investigators, who alleged that Sheriff Brad Gates unfairly denied  them concealed weapons permits, will receive $616,000 in a court judgment  approved Friday that will end more than a decade of controversy over the way  Gates issues gun permits.  </P> <P> The judgment, to be paid by the county, came after weeks of negotiation between  the sheriff and Frank and Ty Ritter, two brothers who in September won a  $246,000 jury verdict and the right to pursue additional punitive damages from  the sheriff.  </P> <P> With the agreement, Gates will not have to face the possibility of being held  personally accountable for violating the Ritters' constitutional rights. Had  the case gone forward, he would have had to divulge details of his wealth at a  court hearing set to begin Tuesday.  </P> <P> "I'm very happy. It's been 12 years and a long fight," said Frank Ritter of  Huntington Beach, who was denied a gun permit six times. "Obviously, I am  pleased from the money side, but, in the broader sense, someone has to look  over the sheriff's shoulder because he can't be trusted to look over his own  shoulder."  </P> <P> Although the jury decided that the sheriff intentionally discriminated against  the Ritters, Gates maintained again Friday that he and his deputies have tried  to treat everyone fairly when they apply for a concealed weapons permit.  </P> <P> "We are relieved to have this case behind us," the sheriff said. "I have not  been afraid of the process at any point of the game. I think the plaintiffs  probably made a decision to settle rather than take a chance on a long,  drawn-out battle on punitive damages. After 11 or 12 years, that is enough."  </P> <P> The stipulated judgment was approved late Friday afternoon by attorneys for  both sides and U.S. District Court Judge William P. Gray, who presided over the  case. It allows the jury's September verdict against Gates to stand.  </P> <P> Meir J. Westreich, the Ritters' lawyer, said his clients will receive $400,000  of the total award while the remaining $216,000 will be used for legal fees and  a few remaining court costs.  </P> <P> Under terms of the judgment, the Ritters agreed to drop their attempt to obtain  upward of $500,000 in punitive damages from Gates personally. Frank Ritter also  abandoned his request for a gun permit to be granted to him retroactively.  </P> <P> In addition, the Sheriff's Department was ordered to make sure that a new gun  permit policy that Gates intends to issue treats all applicants equally and in  compliance with the U.S. Constitution and state law.  </P> <P> "We have a conclusion that makes it very clear that Sheriff Brad Gates is not  abiding by the law, plain and simple," Westreich said. "The fact remains there  is a final judgment that shows Brad Gates violated his oath of office by  applying a policy that violated the Constitution of the United States. That  judgment stands."  </P> <P> The Ritters, both of Orange County, were denied a permit to carry a concealed  weapon six times in the late 1970s and early 1980s. They alleged in their  lawsuit that Gates discriminated against them as private investigators and  oversaw a process that improperly issued many gun permits to political backers,  wealthy business people and friends of the sheriff.  </P> <P> During three weeks of trial, the defense contended that the sheriff tried to  treat every applicant fairly and that there was no indication that political  influence or lack of it had anything to do with the fact that the Ritters did  not get permits.  </P> <P> On Sept. 28, the jury found that the Ritters' failure to support the sheriff  politically was not a motivating factor in the denial of their gun permits.  Jurors decided that Gates intentionally discriminated against the brothers  because they were private investigators.  </P> <P> Finally, jurors found that Gates acted with malice or reckless disregard for  the Ritters' constitutional rights, which subjected the sheriff to the  possibility of additional punitive damages to be determined by the same jury at  a later hearing.  </P> <P> "I certainly understand the jury's feelings," Gates said, "but I believe my  people and my department were trying to do the right thing. I think that this  is underscored by the fact that the judge did not want the plaintiffs to take  part in the review of the gun-permit process. Without talking to him, I think  it is an indication that he trusts us to do the right thing."  </P> <P> Westreich disagreed. "It is outrageous that someone who is agreeing to pay  $616,000 and agreeing to an order to obey his own oath of office can turn this  upside down and say, 'The judge trusts me,' " he said. "Can the public afford  the trust this judge has in the sheriff? It has cost them $616,000."  </P> <P> Gates noted that his department has issued 448 gun permits to private security  personnel and private investigators since 1978. He reiterated that his efforts  since becoming sheriff in 1975 have reduced the number of gun permits from  about 3,000 to 250.  </P> <P> Gates also said the California State Sheriff's Assn. will be introducing  legislation to have the state assume the responsibility for issuing concealed  weapons permits to private investigators and security personnel to avoid future  problems for local law enforcement agencies.  </P> <P> Had the case gone into the punitive-damage phase, Westreich was prepared to  argue that Gates deliberately ignored the U.S. Constitution and a 1978 Orange  County Superior Court decision that said he discriminated against private  investigators who applied for gun permits.  </P> <P> Westreich also said he would have contended that Gates showed disregard for the  jury's $246,000 award by making statements to the media minimizing his  responsibility in violating the Ritters' constitutional rights.  </P> <P> Eric L. Dobberteen, Gates' lawyer, has contended that punitive damages were not  deserved because Gates was acting in his official capacity as sheriff and did  not consider the Ritters' gun permit applications himself.  </P> <P> Dobberteen was prepared to argue that the sheriff never benefited personally  nor tried to benefit personally from the Ritters' applications, such as asking  for political support or campaign contributions in exchange for gun permits.  </P></p>

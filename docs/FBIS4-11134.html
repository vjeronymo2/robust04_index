			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities monitored through 21 April.    The Inter-American Development Bank, IDB, has granted  Uruguay  a $30 million loan to finance investments in social policies,  health services, education, employment, and justice system  modernization. The loan agreement was signed in Guadalajara,  Mexico, by Economy and Finance Minister Ignacio de Posadas and  IDB President Enrique Iglesias. (Montevideo EL PAIS in Spanish 9  Apr 94 p 1)    The General Taxation Directorate, DGI, has reported that tax  collections during 1993 did not increase, despite all government  and DGI efforts in that direction. The report says that between  January and November 1993, Uruguayans paid $1.95 billion in  taxes, while foreign trade contributed $157 million. (Montevideo  EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in Spanish 11 Apr 94 p 9)    The Central Bank reported on 11 April that the trade balance  deficit continued to grow during January 1994. Total exports  during this month were close to $113 million, while imports  amounted to nearly $189 million. During this month exports grew  by 6.9 percent, while imports increased by almost 14 percent as  compared to the figures for January 1993. The report notes,  however, that the deficit is almost entirely covered by income  from tourism and the entry of new capital. (Montevideo EL  OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in Spanish 12 Apr 94 p 7)</p>

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy selling of Steel A NEGATIVE recommendation and heavy selling sent British Steel to its lowest level since the shares were floated at 110p in December 1988. The stock dipped below 50p for the first time to close 2 1/2 off at 49p on unusually heavy turnover of 32m shares. County NatWest repeated its short-term sell advice, which argues that the dividend will be cut to 3p and that for sufficient yield the shares need to fall to 45p. Analyst Mr Sandy Morris said: 'If the UK were forced to raise interest rates, one of the companies most badly hit would be British Steel.' The securities house acted on behalf of a UK seller who wanted to offload more than 15m shares. County sold the stock in London at 47 1/2 p a share and found a buyer in New York, where investors are apparently prepared to take a much longer view and like the company's asset value. Shortly before the market closed, another large block of shares - 8.1m  - was traded in London at 43p. The low price of the late trade suggested one half of a tax-related 'bed-and-breakfast' deal. GrandMet setback A warning from Grand Metropolitan that profits would be flat this year sent the shares into hasty retreat. The focus of the brewing and food group's worries lies in its US operations, namely the loss-making Pearl Vision optician chain and the Jolly Green Giant food division. The latter, which contributes a third of GrandMet's US food revenue, has been badly hit by the US's second consecutive record harvest, which has depressed sweet corn prices. Business in its UK public houses, predominantly based in the south-east, has also been suffering. Analysts immediately downgraded the group, most moving from the Pounds 1bn level to around Pounds 950m, although criticism was tempered by GrandMet's decision to pay an increased dividend. 'Sustaining profits in this type of market and raising the dividend will not look so bad once the results season gets into gear,' said Mr Geoff Collyer at County NatWest. 'They may come back into favour on that.' He has moved to a short-term hold but remains a long-term buyer. The shares, down 43 at one stage, recovered to 379p for a loss of 33 on the day. Turnover was a hefty 12m. Recs bought Another solid performance from the regional electricity stocks (Recs) was underpinned by the continuing move by institutional investors out of the Electricity Package, which ceases to be traded on September 4, and into selected Recs. Yesterday it was the turn of the second-line Recs to attract institutional interest as Credit Lyonnais Laing decided they looked cheap and likely to outperform in the short-term. Seeboard gained 10 to 325p and Manweb 11 to 358p, while the Package rose 27 to Pounds 3310. Gas disappoints A second-quarter loss, a slightly disappointing interim dividend and a warning that full-year profits will be well below last year's triggered sustained selling of British Gas. The stock finished 5 1/2 lower at 237 1/2 p, having touched 236p. Turnover reached 11.5m, well above usual levels. Mr Steve Turner at Smith New Court said: 'British Gas is facing a particularly nasty margin squeeze at present, with gas prices falling and costs rising sharply.' Following the figures, Smith reduced its current year estimate from Pounds 1.1bn to Pounds 1bn and shaved its dividend forecast from 14.25p to 14p. Other analysts, however, suggested the market had been too optimistic on the interim payment, with Ms Christine Baker at Nomura noting that the dividend 'still represents a real rate of increase' and the shares 'remain attractive in the context of the nervous state of the equity market'. National Westminster Bank was easily the worst performer in a generally resilient banks sector yesterday. The stock weakened to 301p before closing 13 down at 302p amid hints that the bank may reveal more details of some of its bad debts in a routine report to the US Stock Exchange Commission. Composite insurers were under further pressure, still unsettled by fears of a rise in domestic interest rates and, to a much lesser extent, worries about Hurricane Andrew, which has caused severe damage in Florida. Sun Alliance was heavily sold late in the session, sliding to 214p before stabilising to end a net 7 weaker at 217 1/2 p. Turnover reached a hefty 6.8m. Turnover of 14m in BP was substantially swollen by a late trade of 6.2m shares transacted at 178p; the deal was thought to have represented a bed-and-breakfast, or tax-related, trade. Interim results from Graseby, formerly Cambridge Electronics, were in line with market expectations, but sentiment was unsettled by worries about the outlook for the full year and the chances of the group paying the final dividend. The shares dropped to 128p before closing 34 off at 133p. Carlton Communications slid 20 to 541p on fears of vulnerability to a weak dollar. ECC Group was also affected by dollar weakness and further depressed by talk of analysts downgrading full-year profits forecasts for the company after half-year results next month. The shares fell 30 to 450p. Conglomerate Hanson was beginning to look oversold yesterday and the shares picked up a penny against the market trend to close at 186 1/2 p. Shares in hotel group Forte crumbled after Sodexho, the French catering group, denied press reports that it was about to buy Forte's Gardner Merchant subsidiary. Forte was off 10 at one point but recovered to 127p to leave a decline of 3. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (7).

			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANTS / MAX JACOBSON;  </P> <P> CONCEPTUAL PREGO MENU READS BETTER THAN IT PLAYS  </P> <P> Prego is still one of Orange County's most impressively designed restaurants: a  gorgeous Tuscan villa with high vaulted ceilings and a gleaming open kitchen  along one wall, dominated by a huge rotating brass rotisserie. Soaring glass  panels separate the dining areas. Monster tropical plants dominate the  entrance.  </P> <P> The menu has been carefully designed here, too. This is a concept restaurant  where everything from breadsticks to mints have been market-tested and given a  stamp of approval by the corporate fathers of the upscale Spectrum restaurant  chain. Perhaps that accounts for the restaurant's unbridled success. Prego has  been jammed to the rafters with a well-heeled clientele from Day One and shows  no signs of slowing down.  </P> <P> The cuisine is Tuscan, sort of. Dishes are simple and direct: homemade pastas,  simple sauces, grilled meats served with roasted potatoes. The new executive  chef, Luigi Giordani, is actually a Roman, rather than a Tuscan, and plans to  introduce more of his own regional dishes in the near future, if the company  lets him.  </P> <P> The former chef, Tim Dobravolskis, has moved up the corporate ladder and now  oversees five of Spectrum's Southern California kitchens. "We get everyone from  Newport Beach yuppie to Anaheim local -- everything from Topsider to tuxedo,"  Dobravolskis said by phone recently, "So we aim to play it safe. The concept  has worked so far, so why tamper with success?"  </P> <P> I can think of one reason. Prego is a stunning restaurant, but it just isn't as  good as it could be. The truth is, I am never as happy eating off this menu as  I am reading it. It isn't in playing it safe that the restaurant occasionally  slips up. It's a simple matter of cooking. "In a restaurant of this size,"  Dobravolskis said, "you have to depend on your line cooks." Sorry, Tim, but  these guys can be awfully erratic.  </P> <P> Why else would well-conceived dishes made from first-rate ingredients fail to  impress? Sadly overcooked spaghettini spoil a wonderfully rich, grainy pesto  sauce. Luganega (thin coiled sausages) come flanked by vegetables quite sodden  with olive oil, making a little pool on the bottom of the plate. A pool of high  grade olive oil, to be sure.  </P> <P> That said, there are many things to relish from Prego's kitchen. The antipasti  are uniformly delicious. Soncino con anitra is a tempting salad of mache, cold  roasted duck breast, goat cheese and balsamic vinegar; an intelligent blend of  northern Italy and California. Insalata al salmone affumicato is arugula topped  with lightly smoked salmon, bow-tie pasta and plenty of capers. It sounds  quirky but works like a charm.  </P> <P> The pizzas are even better. They generally have a thick crust and are the ideal  size as an intermediate course for about three people. My favorite among them  is pizza alla salsiccia, topped with chunky sausage, salami, fresh tomato sauce  and oregano, all partially concealed under a blanket of bubbling mozzarella.  </P> <P> But the best things served at Prego come from that rotisserie: duck, rabbit,  chicken and/or leg of lamb, all of which you'll smell as you enter the  restaurant, long before you see them. I have tasted only the duck and the lamb,  but I am willing to predict that the other two are every bit as terrific. All  the meats here are rubbed with fresh rosemary and sage, an irresistible  perfection of nature, and look as well dressed as most of the customers.  </P> <P> The pastas are a different story. Trenette alle cozze affumicate, a narrow,  linguine-like pasta, was good in itself but came with smoked mussels that were  hard and chewy and tasted canned. Agnolotti d'aragosta is a dish of  crescent-shaped pockets filled with lobster, prosciutto and ricotta in lemon  and lobster sauce that never quite lives up to its billing. I couldn't taste  anything but ricotta in the filling, though the sauce was so good I didn't  leave a single drop.  </P> <P> Neither are the grills, as distinguished from the spit-roasted dishes, always  good. Grilled salmon, a daily special, was dry and salty, hardly the chic way  to prepare salmon these days. But pollo all'aiglio e rosmarino, Prego's  trademark garlic chicken breast with rosemary, fared much better with its crisp  blackened skin and a lemon flavor permeating every bite.  </P> <P> As for desserts, there are the usual northern Italian offerings; gelati,  tiramisu, semifreddo and various pastries. The tiramisu is especially good: a  fat, indulgent one with a double portion of mascarpone and what must be a  tablespoon of cocoa per slice.  </P> <P> I do have a couple of bones to pick with Prego regarding service: The seating  can be awfully rigid here, so you had better arrive bang on time for your  reservation. We were exactly 10 minutes late one evening and waited half an  hour for a table. The kitchen can be sluggish, too. While you are waiting for  your first course, it's easy to fill up on those good bread sticks -- but  that's hardly what you have come for.  </P> <P> I should also say something about the wine list, on the menu's left page.  There's a wide variety of good Italian wines on this list, and I especially  urge you to try one. Times wine writer Dan Berger recommends an '83 Chianti  Classico Machiavelli for $18 and an '84 Barolo Ceretto for $33. Interestingly,  if you show a lot of interest in wine they may bring out a short, erratically  priced list that does have some real bargains on it. On Dan Berger's word I  tried the '88 Ca' del Bosco Chardonnay ($30) and found it delightfully fruity  and springlike.  </P> <P> For all its grand style, Prego is moderately priced. Antipasti are $4.85 to  $8.75. Pizzas are $6.95 to $10.95. Pastas are $8.50 to $11.75. Grills are $9.95  to $17.50. Desserts are $3.95 to $4.95.  </P> <P> PREGO  </P> <P> 18420 Von Karman Ave., Irvine  </P> <P> (714) 553-1333  </P> <P> Open every day, Mondays from 11:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m., Tuesdays through  Thursdays from 11:30 a.m. to 11 p.m, Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to midnight,  Saturdays from 5 p.m. to midnight, and Sundays from 5 p.m. to 10:30 p.m.  </P> <P> All major cards.  </P></p>

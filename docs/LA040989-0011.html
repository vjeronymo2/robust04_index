			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> MARKOWITZ'S MESSAGE  </P> <P> Someone at Calendar either has a peculiarly nasty sense of humor or has simply  not been paying attention. Allowing Charles Markowitz to write about a  playwright is like asking a skinhead to do a piece on the local rabbi ("When  Reel and Real-Life Merge Into One Image," April 2).  </P> <P> Markowitz has built a career by expressing his contempt for playwrights,  assaulting script after script in exercises that resemble drive-by shootings  more than productions.  </P> <P> There may be legitimacy to this approach to theater, but it makes him a curious  choice to do an article on any playwright, much less Tom Stoppard.  </P> <P> I wouldn't ask The Times to protect playwrights (Lord knows that critic Dan  Sullivan isn't much help), but when a writer's bias is so extreme as  Markowitz's, you're only asking for incompetence; Markowitz delivers.  </P> <P> DAVID LINK  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

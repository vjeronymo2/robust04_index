These viruses could be introduced into the United States through the importation of tomatoes from Almeria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This rule will allow only tomato fruit from Almeria into the United States. Tomato fruit is not a vector of either virus.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  APHIS has proposed to require the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food (MAFF) to establish a Mediterranean fruit fly (Medfly) trapping program in order for tomatoes from Almeria, Spain, to be exported to the United States. MAFF would be required to begin trapping 2 months prior to the shipping season and continue trapping until the season's end. APHIS has agreed to allow MAFF to use the Nadel type trap.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> APHIS should require MAFF to use McPhail type traps as well as Nadel traps in order to better detect female flies (McPhail traps use a food lure and attract both male and female flies, while Nadel traps use a sex lure and attract male flies primarily).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, possibly, APHIS should require MAFF to use ``sticky'' traps, which use a no-pest strip to trap flies, rather than Nadel traps, which use a pesticide. Sticky traps are more effective than Nadel traps. Also, APHIS should require MAFF to trap all year long. Though the climate in Almeria is dry and generally inhospitable to the Medfly, irrigation has altered the environment so that the Medfly might survive there year round, not just during the tomato growing season.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the future, it may be prudent to require MAFF to use McPhail as well as Nadel traps around tomato screenhouses in Almeria. However, in extremely hot and arid climates, such as in Almeria, the food lure used in McPhail traps evaporates within a few days and the trap becomes ineffective. APHIS has yet to resolve this problem. We believe that the Nadel trap will effectively detect any Medfly infestations in Almeria, but we will continue to examine the possibility of requiring the use of the McPhail trap for supplemental trapping.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In regard to possibly requiring that MAFF use ``sticky'' rather than Nadel traps in Almeria, tests conducted at our Hawaii Methods Development Station indicate that Nadel traps are as effective as ``sticky'' traps in detecting Medfly infestations. Therefore, we will allow MAFF to use the Nadel trap.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We will not require MAFF to trap for Medfly throughout the year in Almeria. In Almeria, when the tomato shipping season ends in April, the screenhouses are taken down and nothing is grown until the next season. As stated above, the climate is arid and hot and there is very little, if any, indigenous Medfly host material. Furthermore, tomatoes are grown several kilometers from residential areas, where there may be host material in the summer. We do not believe that there could be any Medfly infestation in the tomato growing areas in Almeria outside of the growing season and therefore will not require MAFF to trap for Medflies until 2 months prior to the season and through its end, as stated in the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

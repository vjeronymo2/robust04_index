			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLARIFYING ROLE IN CHANNEL GATEWAY  </P> <P> The recent letter (Times, Aug. 12) by the erstwhile president of the Venice  Town Council contained a number of factual errors and erroneous assertions,  which need to be corrected for your readers.  </P> <P> It is stated that I "(made) sure" that the Coastal Commission held its hearing  on Channel Gateway in Eureka instead of waiting a month for a meeting in the  Marina. Wrong.  </P> <P> The Coastal Commission makes its own decisions about scheduling and, as it  happens, obeys the state Coastal Act in doing so. That law says that the  Coastal Commission is obliged to hear every appeal within 49 days of its being  filed.  </P> <P> A Venice resident filed an appeal on Gateway on July 13. According to the  commission staff report, the last day to hold a hearing is Aug. 31, several  days prior to the Marina del Rey meeting in September. Without permission of  the project applicant, the hearing can't be postponed. The applicant would not  grant a postponement, so by law it has to take place in Eureka.  </P> <P> Regarding the assertion that I have "sold out every principle (I) ever claimed  to believe in" in order to provide affordable housing, my entire career as a  community activist is marked by strenuous efforts to work within the system to  provide new affordable housing in the Coastal Zone. There are dozens of  affordable units on the ground to prove it, and hundreds more in the pipeline  as a result of my continued efforts since being elected to the council.  </P> <P> As for what's happening to the community as a whole, the record clearly shows  that commercial development applications in Venice are down by about 50% and  approvals down even more than that, compared to what was going on before I took  office in 1987. Claims to the contrary are merely politically motivated  rhetoric from people unwilling to make the tough choices required to create  affordable housing on expensive land in tight financial times.  </P> <P> Finally, regarding reelection campaign offers, I continue to adhere to my  long-standing policy of neither soliciting nor accepting campaign contributions  from developers with controversial projects pending in my district. If one  comes in unsolicited, I return it. This policy will keep my campaign fund  anything but full. By the way, my campaign finance reports are on file with the  City Clerk and available for public review.  </P> <P> RUTH GALANTER  </P> <P> Councilwoman, 6th District  </P></p>

"We  can't but feel concerned that North Korea did not fully and  sincerely uphold its agreement with the IAEA (International  Atomic Energy Agency) and that diversion of nuclear material for  military purposes could not be verified," Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata told a press conference.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura also said during  an earlier press conference that Japan is "deeply concerned."    The IAEA said Wednesday Pyongyang obstructed checks at a key  nuclear facility and that the agency would hold a special  meeting of its board of governors next Monday, as the  long-standing nuclear controversy with North Korea soared to new  heights.    The Vienna-based international nuclear watchdog said North  Korea barred a team of its inspectors from carrying out  "important measures" at a radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon  which the IAEA regards as a nuclear reprocessing plant.    The United States also said a third round of talks with  North  Korea, scheduled for next Monday in Geneva, would be postponed  due to North Korea's refusal to cooperate.    Hata and Takemura both cited the necessity of renewed calls  to North Korea to completely accept international inspections of  all its facilities. Hata said the problem of North Korea's  suspected nuclear program would naturally be discussed when  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa visits China from Saturday to  Monday.    Government officials have said Hosokawa is expected to call  for China's continued role in persuading Pyongyang to accept  full inspections to sweep away international concern over its  alleged nuclear program.    Hata said Japan wants to seek a solution to the problem  through negotiations. He declined to say what the Japanese  Government would do if the IAEA meeting adopted a resolution  referring the matter to the United Nations Security Council,  saying it is too early to comment.    If the IAEA meeting declares North Korea in breach of  nuclear  safeguard accords, the matter would be referred to the U.N.  Security Council, which might impose economic sanctions on  Pyongyang.    A South Korean Foreign Ministry official said Thursday that  the nuclear watchdog is likely to demand that North Korea grant  complete inspections of its radiochemical laboratory instead of  opting for sanctions.</p>

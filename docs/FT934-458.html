			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Television and Radio Review: A grand animation - Christmas Day If you like the animated animals in the electricity commercials you may want to see A Grand Day Out (5.35pm, BBC2). This began, astonishingly, as Nick Park's graduation film when he was a student at the National Film School in 1985. The moment his work arrived in the public domain, Park was pursued for commercials and other work. His first film, Creature Comforts, won an Oscar. A Grand Day Out 'stars' Wallace, the inventor, and his dog Gromit, who appear again in Park's new work, The Wrong Trousers, which is shown tomorrow. That is followed by the first television screening of Christopher Gable's new production of A Christmas Carol for the Northern Ballet Theatre. Music is by Carl Davis, performed by the BBC Philharmonic and the Wakefield Cathedral Boys' Choir, choreography by Massimo Morricone, designs by Les Brotherston, and the dancers include Jeremy Kerridge, Matthew Madsen, and Fergus Logan. Swan Song, a 30-minute dramatisation of a Chekhov short story (C4 at 8.30pm) was shot in two days for Pounds 12,000 by Kenneth Branagh at the Criterion Theatre in London, it stars John Gielgud as an old actor who, after his farewell performance, thinks back to his great Shakespearian roles. BBC2 provides a rare television showing for Bunuel's engrossing 1967 film Belle De Jour. Catherine Deneuve at her most beautiful plays a bored middle class housewife who decides to occupy her daytime hours by working in a brothel. As ever, it is hard to know where reality begins and ends. Some of the imagery is extraordinarily erotic, though the women-and-cruelty fantasies begin to look a bit questionable (10.55pm).</p>

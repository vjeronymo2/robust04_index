			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Survey of Reinsurance (5): Natural disasters multiply - Global warming makes insurers sweat THE scope and frequency of claims due to natural catastrophes has risen drastically over recent decades leading to unprecedented losses for insurers and reinsurers alike. The trend was highlighted by Swiss Re in Sigma, its monthly review of reinsurance developments. Its review of catastrophe and other major losses in 1992 shows that natural disasters again dominated the year with a record 130 events resulting in an insured loss of Dollars 22.5bn, up 108 per cent on the previous year's figure. Nor was the long-term comparison any healthier. Loss figures have remained high for the last four years while average losses rose alarmingly. From 1970 to 1981 the insured loss per catastrophic event averaged Dollars 84m (1992 prices). Between 1982 and 1991, however, the figure rose Dollars 132.8m. Swiss Re concluded that economic factors were responsible for only a small proportion of the losses: GNP increased by 85 per cent over the last 23 years, while insured losses increased by over 900 per cent. Others factors, including the settlement and industrialisation of vulnerable areas and an increase in insurance density were no less important and may gain further significance. This applied especially to climatic conditions 'since it appears quite likely that the loss surge is at least in part due to climatic change ..' Sigma says that its statistics do not tell us precisely 'how or why mankind aggravates catastrophe risks or allows them to become worse ..' but that they 'do clearly indicate that risks are increasing; they give us the urgent warning to examine the causes of these trends and to develop effective preventive strategies.' Research by Munich Re has highlighted 'already disturbing signs of the worldwide warming of the atmosphere'. For example, 1990 was the warmest year since meteorological records began, and six of the last 10 years have seen global temperatures higher than all previous readings. Current information, seems to point to a global rise in temperature of between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees by the end of the next century. Assuming that all the predicted effects of the man-made greenhouse effect become reality, just what will mankind be up against? Munich Re assumes the following line of development: A warmer atmosphere would result in a greater exchange of energy adding to the momentum of vertical exchange processes which are the driving force in the development of tropical cyclones, tornadoes and thunderstorms resulting in increased frequency and strength. More severe winter storms in Europe similar to those in late January and March 1990 which resulted in an insured loss of DM17.3bn are feasible. Increased exposure to storm surges and flooding in low-lying, densely-populated regions such as Bangladesh, because of a 30cm-100cm rise in sea levels within 100 years. The jury has still not reached its verdict on global warming. However, most of its members would probably support the view expressed by Swiss Re in its 1990 annual report that 'reinsurers cannot afford to wait for scientists to provide evidence of how climatic change will influence natural events such as storm, hail and flooding and so on. Underwriting policy and commitment acceptance must be adjusted now to possible future developments.' But just how can the insurance and reinsurance industry cope with the increased loss potential of natural catastrophes? Munich Re believes that industry can either adjust to the situation or minimise or prevent the effects and suggests a number of instruments that the risk community has at its disposal including: Charging premiums commensurate with risk, which would mean breaking down the product into its constituent parts and calculating the risk premium for each peril that could impact on an account. It should be kept in mind that historical return periods for these perils may well have been altered by global warming. The challenge for reinsurers is to provide cover at rates that not only reflect the past, but to set prices which anticipate future loss. Substantial deductibles and insurance participation by the insured. Munich Re demonstrates the effectiveness of a deductible in its study 1990 Winter Storms in Europe, illustrating how a deductible of DM500 on a German homeowners' comprehensive policy would have reduced aggregate insured losses by 30 per cent and the number of insured losses by 40 pr cent. Liability limits per loss event or area with those liabilities rendered transparent by determining accumulation. Limits on cover or exclusions for certain hazards. Loss prevention through policyholder education about measures which may bring about a reduction in weather damage claims. Optimal loss settlement. Munich Re maintains that the effects of climatic change need not have a negative impact as long as the above disciplines are introduced. However, clients of insurers and reinsurers would have to be aware of environmental changes to motivate them to take suitable countermeasures such as participation in the United Nations International Decade of Natural Disaster Reduction aimed at combating the increased danger of natural disasters or ratification of the World Climate Convention.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The comment lists several possible methods by which third party processors could be treated unfairly by EPS, such as delays in the payment of moneys owed, unnecessary mandatory training sessions, and late notification of network technical changes. Because the proposed Final Judgment requires that third party processors and intercept processors have equal access to the network, any such discriminatory treatment would violate the proposed Final Judgment. Additional restrictions are unnecessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Pricing Structure <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An anonymous comment discussed the EPS pricing structure for third party processors and suggested several changes to that structure for incorporation into the Final Judgment. One section of this comment alleged that EPS rules require third party processors seeking access to the MAC network to be ``sponsored'' by a MAC member depository institution, and that the third party processor is often charged a fee by the MAC member for this sponsorship. Such a sponsorship requirement would violate paragraph IV.E of the proposed Final Judgment, which requires that third party processors be offered access to the MAC network equal in type and quality to that offered to intercept processors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comment also stated that the charge paid by third party processors in most ATM networks consists of a combination of a charge from the network and a charge from the card-issuing bank, and that this latter charge is paid by the network to the card-issuing bank. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  The comment alleged that this ``bundling'' of fees is anticompetitive, apparently arguing that this conduct constitutes a tying violation. However, a traditional element of tying violations is that the products are actually separate; in other words, that they can be or have been bought or sold separately. The comment itself suggests that all ATM networks currently charge in this manner. Moreover, to the knowledge of the United States, EPS is not currently engaged in such conduct since, as discussed in the Complaint and Competitive Impact Statement, EPS essentially has no third party processors in its network. If EPS chooses to institute such a pricing policy it can then be determined if the policy violates the proposed Final Judgment or antitrust laws. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The United States is not at all certain that this is the case. It is the understanding of the United States that in most ATM networks a transaction that reaches the network switch through the third party processor of the bank acquiring the transaction results only in a charge for use of the network. The only other charge associated with the transaction is an ``exchange revenue'' charge which is paid by the card-issuing bank to the transaction-acquiring bank. In essence, this is a charge for use of the acquiring bank's ATM terminal by the cardholder of the card-issuing bank. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, the comment argues that the proposed Final Judgment should order EPS to distribute MAC price lists as a method of ``policing'' the non-discrimination clause. However, there is no reason to believe either that EPS will violate the proposed Final Judgment by offering discriminatory pricing or that it would be able to keep such a blatant violation confidential. In addition, the proposed Final Judgment permits the United States to issue inquiries to EPS which would easily determine its pricing arrangements. It is therefore not necessary to order publication of price lists. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII. Subswitching <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Money Station argued that by permitting EPS to charge for subswitching of transactions, the proposed Final Judgment interferes with the ability of third party processors to access the network. ``Subswitching'' refers to the switching of transactions between members of the same regional network without accessing that network, and therefore without paying its switch fees. Generally this is done by passing the transaction through a third party processor that provides ATM processing for both members. Many regional ATM networks, although not all, have rules against subswitching. These networks argue that cardholders, who make the ultimate decision about which ATM to access, choose a particular ATM based upon their expectation that the transaction will be routed over a common regional ATM network, known to the cardholder by the brand logo on the ATM and the card. Permitting subswitching in this view merely allows third party processors to ``free ride'' on the advertising efforts of the common network. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph IV.G.2 of the proposed Final Judgment permits EPS to charge a royalty on subswitching equal to the price EPS would charge for a switched transaction. As Money Station notes, this would likely discourage subswitching since the third party processor would also charge a fee for its services. Nevertheless, this will not discourage entry by third party processors. As described in the Complaint, third party processors have not been successful in entering MAC's geographic region because MAC members have been unable to purchase their ATM processing services. The proposed Final Judgment ensures that MAC members will be able to use third party processors. Inability to offer subswitching does not appear to be a substantial barrier to entry. Moreover, third party processors wishing to offer the ability to switch transactions can simply become a network by ``branding'' their services; in other words, putting their brand logos on cards and ATMs. The third party processor would then become a competing regional ATM network to which EPS, according to paragraph IV.H of the proposed Final Judgment, may not restrict access. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

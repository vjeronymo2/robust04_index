			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic given to </F> OSLOBODJENJE on 10 April; place not given: "The United States  Insists on Democratic Bosnia"]    [Text] The conversation with Prime Minister Silajdzic was  carried out in an atmosphere full of expectation for any news  from Gorazde to come in, on the 10th day of the aggressor's  offensive against the town that has nothing left to defend  itself with after two years of blockade. On Sunday, 10 April,  in the afternoon hours, telegrams and messages from the field  with dramatic reports of the aggressor's tanks rumbling into a  southern suburb of Gorazde, just one kilometer away from the  hospital, kept coming in. At the same time messages from  foreign leaders and from all over the world were coming in,  expressing great concern over the fate of Gorazde. Immediately  after 1600 the prime minister was informed that NATO planes had  set off for Gorazde. At the moment when the prospects for air  strikes were still indefinite, we started our interview with the  question: To what extent is the international community  responsible for the tragedy of the people in eastern Bosnia?    [Silajdzic] The fact is that we are witnessing such a  situation in Gorazde because the international community has  intervened so far by benefiting the aggressor. They have  forbidden us to defend ourselves. Therefore I think that the  international community is responsible for the death of 200,000  people, for the hardships of refugees, orphans, for the  backsliding of Bosnia into a stone age. The world owes Bosnia a  lot, and everything it does, repays just a small part of the  debt.    [OSLOBODJENJE] In what way did the government of  Bosnia-Herzegovina help the defense of eastern Bosnia?    [Silajdzic] The defense of eastern Bosnia last year was  obstructed because the warlords in Herzegovina blocked the  convoys carrying weapons. It first happened in Metkovic, and  then in Grude. Just a small amount of the weapons passed. If we  had procured those weapons, the situation in eastern Bosnia  would have been different.    [OSLOBODJENJE] When speaking about procurement of arms,  these days, for the first time, your role in that is being  mentioned, but also denied. Can you explain that?    [Silajdzic] Following my initiative, donors to the cause of  Bosnia-Herzegovina were urged, so they started carrying out a  plan for supplying the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina with arms.  This project, being, of course, not the only one, forwarded  arms worth $36 million to air and sea ports in a neighboring  country, given that one ship (worth $7 million) was halted. The  $20-million shipment of arms from that ship is still waiting in  a port for the arms embargo to be lifted. There are documents  on that case, while the entire consignment, short of the  aforementioned ship about which LJILJAN has also written,  reached the planned destination. What happened thereafter is  something else. All I know is that the 2,000-ton consignment  was halved on its way through Herzegovina. In any case, a  considerable amount of arms did reach central Bosnia in time, at  the very beginning of clashes with the Croatian extremists.  "Strijele" missiles from that contingent helped the defenders to  halt the aggressor's tanks in Sarajevo, Olovo, Gradacac, and so  forth. Unfortunately, these matters, and the people who took  part in such projects, cannot be discussed publicly, which is  being misused in the power struggle. That is wrong. It is not  a right time for bargaining over merits. Now I have to  acknowledge, without any feigned modesty, that it was an  excellently done job, and I do not intend to account for my  conduct to anybody.    [OSLOBODJENJE] You are the head of the first government with  a Bosnian platform. How do you assess the first five months of  its work?    [Silajdzic] Just remember what the moment was like when we  started. We were confronted with three or four months of  winter, and the main task was to survive. We had to ensure at  least minimal quantities of gas, power, food.... And all that  had to be done by negotiations with the aggressor, or in any  other way. I think that we passed the test, and also thanks to  the fact that the winter was mild. As for the government  itself, we accomplished the task thanks to the enthusiasm and  devotion of the people who took up the job. I believe that I am  to be given least credit for that.    Of course, certain things could have been done much better.  After all, the assembly has paid tribute to the new government,  which is a great honor for us, because normally, on such  occasions, it is negative things that are focused on. Of  course, a great help was that the citizens of this country have  shown unbelievable patience, willpower, and readiness to live on  a minimum. I do not consider myself to be a good organizer, nor  am I a good administrator, although those properties are very  important for a prime minister. It seems that all of us were  going beyond our own limits in the past months, and somehow  managed to survive the winter. Now we are at a turning point.  Which is a different story, though.    [OSLOBODJENJE] Are you referring to the Bosniak-Croatian  federation?    [Silajdzic] I think that by the agreement on the federation  a strategically very important step has been made toward  establishing Bosnia-Herzegovina that we are fighting and  endeavoring for. That is to say, for an integral, undivided,  and democratic state without national territories. Bosnia may  be carved up only by blood, and that is what extreme fascists on  both sides tried to accomplish, but despite enormous numbers of  casualties and unprecedented violence they have eventually  failed.    Of course, they failed in the first place thanks to the  people who thwarted the forming of the Croatian national  territories aimed at seceding from Bosnia-Herzegovina. We are  struggling to make the territories with a Serbian national  majority somehow integrate into a unified state, in the least  painful way possible. That struggle will be lengthy and  difficult. The war is not over yet, and the aggressor still  aspires to add a great part of Bosnia-Herzegovina to greater  Serbia.    We are resisting such aspirations by fighting against the  aggressor, by activities on the international stage, and by  telling the truth. It was necessary to incite the international  public opinion, and in the first place to explain where  Bosnia-Herzegovina is at all, and what is happening in it. It  was necessary to represent Bosnia, to open doors, make friends,  develop a diplomatic framework, and all that without a single  pause, starting with zero and broken communication. In short,  we were supposed to behave like a state, because the world does  not change because of Bosnia. The fact is that  Bosnia-Herzegovina is a recognized country today, that doors are  open to it almost everywhere, it is a member of almost all the  international organizations, and it is very respected abroad.    [OSLOBODJENJE] What are the risks of the turning point that  you mentioned?    [Silajdzic] The turning point is in our attempts, and I  think we are on the best possible way, to remedy the  consequences of the aggression in a way that ensures a civilized  and democratic future. The federation, whose constitution has  already been adopted, is the best possible move, because it  makes possible a reorganization in one part of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the one that is not occupied, enabling us to  improve the current situation, and also to establish foundations  for the future. The central government is strong enough to  guarantee the functioning of the state, as well as enough  cantonal autonomy that will ensure unobstructed regional  development, which is a European trend. As early as now we are  being invited to continue the talks, which started before the  war, with the representatives of the Italian region of Marca.    Such a state system ensures enough freedom in economics,  religion, and culture, so that every citizen may express himself  or herself in the way he or she wants. On the other hand, the  multiethnic dimension, or rather polyvalence of Bosnia, has been  preserved, and, as one of my friends put it, that polyvalence  stretches from the East to the West, which is a comparative  advantage that other countries do not have. Of course, if we  are wise enough to make good use of it.    [OSLOBODJENJE] The Washington agreement is a confirmation of  the international support to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Ostensibly,  everything has come about quite unexpectedly. What was its  preface?    [Silajdzic] The agreement did not come about overnight.  There were many negotiations. Unfortunately, many things, when  speaking of diplomacy and logistics, are not supposed to be  publicly explained. At a last year's meeting -- Alija  Izetbegovic, Franjo Tudjman, Hrvoje Sarinic, Miomir Zuzul, Ivo  Komsic, and myself were present -- a possible agreement of that  kind was discussed. But, to be honest, the U.S. role was  decisive. True, many people were surprised at the agreement.  In the field, the people could hardly wait for something like  that to happen, and that is the most important thing. Right  now, a great task is awaiting us -- how to implement the  agreement, since almost a half of the country is occupied.    [OSLOBODJENJE] The United States supports Bosnia. What  does the United States expect from Bosnia in return?    [Silajdzic] There is no doubt: The United States expects a  democratic system in Bosnia. Just as Madeleine Albright  stressed here, the Americans are impressed by our consistency in  maintaining a civilized attitude toward different cultures, and  particularly in the field, they are impressed by our tolerance.  Why is the United States so important? I have always  considered it to be important. Europe is always exclusive, and  the leading powers always deal with such issues by applying  colonial methods, or in the way they had dealt with the things  in the two world wars. In that respect the United States has a  much fresher approach, and better understands the relations in  Bosnia. When somebody asks why we need the United States, I  reply: Whenever we are in the situation to mend the injustice  done to us by the imposition of the arms embargo against Bosnia,  like, for example, in the case of Mt Igman, or in Gorazde, we  turn to the United States. We know that Russians are involved  on the side of Serbia. Only a political ignorant would not seek  a balance in the United States. If we want Bosnia to be a  global issue, we must aspire to having the global factor number  on our side. To accomplish that one needs time, effort, and  knowledge.    [OSLOBODJENJE] You said that the United States expects  Bosnia to establish a democratic system. To what extent do you  think we meet those criteria, and are the conditions being  created for the development of a modern democracy?    [Silajdzic] I have noticed that in recent times people are  afraid of speaking out. Some of them do not even want to talk.  Says a deputy: "I do not need leather jackets, even if they were  mine." [as published] I think that fear has to do with several  overambitious people, who fuel such an atmosphere. The Muslims  care about the freedom within a compass that does not hinder the  freedom of other people. In terms of the Bosniak people, the  condensed history and experiences created a healthy attitude  toward life and the world. Those are traits that cannot be  hidden. Our virtues, being our fortune, must come into  prominence. Our negative characteristics are to be found in a  not very great sense for organization. One should create such a  climate in which issues can be freely discussed, just like in  any other democratic state, and even when dealing with  weaknesses. Undoubtedly, there are many talented people, being  an elementary civilizational advantage. Krleza [Miroslav,  famous Croatian author] used to say that people in Bosnia were  familiar with books when in other provinces nobody knew what a  book is. That source of talents still exists, and we have to  make good use of it. The real meaning of merhamet [charity] is  that of a civilizational achievement. That is the awareness of  the necessity to cooperate with others. Therefore we have to  revitalize advantages that were being acquired over many  generations. We need to remain good Bosniaks, but never again  naive Bosniaks. That kind of balance ought to be accomplished.    [OSLOBODJENJE] The impression is, however, that in Bosnia  one rules more by charisma rather than by developing a system of  democratic institutions and relations. Is there any danger of  one-party rule?    [Silajdzic] We were not allowed to develop either  institutions or relations. We had to survive. We have created  preconditions for that, yet a one-party system is still living  in us. It is very difficult to get rid of it. The future  generations will not be burdened by the past. We still are.  The only way of getting rid of that is to strengthen pluralism  -- market competition, competition of thoughts and ideas. The  more we disregard different opinions, the less use we shall have  of our potentials. I have heard that the Bosnian refugee  children abroad are the most successful pupils in schools. You  see, that potential exists, and we have to do everything  possible to develop it. We must not be afraid of success and  competition. Do you know what our basis is? Western analyses  show that thanks to humanitarian resources in the first place we  shall overcome the crisis. For that reason pluralism and  democracy must be developed.    [OSLOBODJENJE] Is there any difference between your and  Izetbegovic's view of Bosnia?    [Silajdzic] No, there is not. The efforts made by some  people to stage disagreements, and to generate conflict  artificially between me and the president, are quite obvious.  That is being done by inventing diverse stories, creating  lobbies. Only the people who have a surplus of time can afford  such activities. I do not have time for such things.  Intriguing, lobbying, making factions, supporting different  factions, cannot last long, and building the state on such  premises has no future.    [OSLOBODJENJE] Do recent shifts of personnel at the  state-run television have anything to do with the aforementioned  activities?    [Silajdzic] I have been informed about those shifts. I am  not familiar with the causes. In any case, arbitrary  elimination of people without legal-based judgments would simply  be a recurrence of something that has already been seen before,  something to which the people said a big "No!" in the first free  elections. As for myself, I need to express my personal  gratitude to all the people who have managed to perform their  jobs over the past two years in the interest of the country --  starting with a nurse who goes every day from Alipasino Polje,  where she lives, to work in the hospital, to the people working  at the television, or those working in local community centers.  Not all citizens are fit for fighting on the front lines, but  still they have been doing whatever they can to help, with more  or less success.    [OSLOBODJENJE] After the NATO ultimatum, and the Washington  agreement, the atmosphere has been as if the war is over, and as  if just a small step divides us from peace. What do you think?    [Silajdzic] The war is not over, but there are people who  behave as though it is. I am afraid that there is ever less  struggling for Bosnia, while ever more struggling for power.  Though it is more about individual cases, that is still enough  to poison the atmosphere, to weaken our unity, and instill  distrust. At this moment there is no better gift we can give to  our enemy. Which is to say, it is about people who think that  the only way for them to come to prominence is through  conflicting situations. When there is no outside enemy, then  such people look for an inside enemy, just as the doctrine of  the Yugoslav People's Army nicely taught me. I have to  illustrate this with one example. Several days ago some people  lined up the personnel of the Bosnian embassy in Zagreb and made  a complete chaos, although the embassy staff worked in  impossible conditions, and took care of the things they are not  even supposed to take care of. Their office hours were until  morning. I witnessed that myself. Those people even carried  the wounded that had been literally unloaded at wee hours in  front of the embassy. Those people are now disappointed and  furious. Nobody is allowed any more to line up people and yell  at them. Nobody is supposed to put up with somebody's  frustrations caused by unrealized ambitions. Some people behave  as if there has been too little fear, shelling, poverty, and  suffering so far. Also, the work performed by the government  cannot be depreciated any more, which is, unfortunately, done  here, as well as abroad, nor is it necessary to prompt  journalists to criticize the government, because they are  capable of doing that themselves. Such an understanding of  freedom, human dignity, politics, will not pass. Some damage  may be done by such activities, but I repeat, all that is  short-lived. Simply, people cannot and should not put up with  that any longer.    [OSLOBODJENJE] Is the distribution of official posts a  stumbling bloc for the further implementation of the  Bosniak-Croatian agreement?    [Silajdzic] Whether the first president will be Bosniak or  Croat was not agreed upon in Washington. The attitude of the  Party of Democratic Action is well-known. If you want to know  my personal attitude, then I have to tell you that, if there is  a man who has really deserved that post, then it is President  Izetbegovic. I think that by following that line a political  agreement can be reached. There is a plenty of work to be done  for anybody. However, a very difficult question is awaiting us  in the future -- how to make it possible for the refugees to  return to their homes. In solving that issue we shall need the  help of the international community and the UNHCR. We shall  also need aid of building materials, in order to develop any  sort of housing program. That will be a greater problem than  food supplies. We have to start any sort of production.    [OSLOBODJENJE] Both in wartime and in peacetime the public  is interested in privileges that go along with power. What kind  of apartment does the Bosnian prime minister live in? Did you  use the priority right for being supplied with power?    [Silajdzic] Unfortunately, merits are already being  rewarded, so that villas in Switzerland and apartments in Vienna  are being dealt out. My 48 square meter apartment was not given  to me either by the former or by the present administration. I  earned it during my 10 years of working abroad, in order not to  be driven to beg somebody for an apartment. That apartment is  unfit for living for the time being, so I have been living at my  sister's. I did not use the priority right for power. Until  recently the neighborhood that I am living in was not supplied  even with gas. We survived on firewood, just like our  neighbors. If there is anything positive about this war, then I  would say it is neighborly relations. Such relations have to be  maintained.    [OSLOBODJENJE] While we were talking, the news on air  strikes against Serb positions around Gorazde came in. There  was no need to ask Silajdzic to comment on it, so this is his  first reaction to the news:    [Silajdzic] Neither the air strikes in Gorazde nor the  ultimatum to Serbs around Sarajevo came about as the result of a  phone call. The people reached for their weapons and made  possible for us to prove ourselves as a military factor in the  first place, and thereafter as a political factor. It is the  people who made possible for us to build our position on the  vision of a free and democratic country. That is the way we  made friends, as many as it is possible to make in politics. By  following that way and sticking to our principles we shall  maintain the positions that we have. To tell you the truth, I  feel really amazed at the sight of a man in a trench filled with  water up to his knees, who has only four bullets left to remain  with on the front line. We have to care for such men, their  families, and particularly for the families of the fallen,  shehits [a Turkish word, denoting a man who fell for his  country]. We, as the government, have done all we could. If it  happens that the care for those people remains just a  proclamation of the current, or any other government, I am sure  that those who were able enough to stand up and defend their  country will be able enough to speak up and demand their rights.</p>

			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Monday Interview: Statesman soothes the waves - Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, talks to Philip Stephens The Conservative party has a simple choice at its conference this week in Blackpool. It can re-ignite the fires over the economy and Europe which for the past year have consumed Mr John Major's government. If it does, the future of the prime minister can be counted in months. Alternatively the party could decide it prefers government to self-destruction, problem-solving to civil war. Mr Major then at least would have a chance. Mr Douglas Hurd, the distinguished elder statesman of a none-too-distinguished cabinet, has largely escaped the opprobrium heaped on his colleagues as the government has stumbled from crisis to crisis. The foreign secretary, of course, was a pivotal figure in both the decision to take sterling into the European Exchange Rate Mechanism and in the battle over Maastricht. Somehow most of the mud stuck to the prime minister. There are those who believe that Mr Hurd's reputation as a master on the diplomatic stage has been badly tarnished by his fierce opposition to military intervention in Bosnia. Lady Thatcher has made little secret of her disgust with what she refers to as Foreign Office appeasement. By and large though, he has escaped the malaise. He came third in the leadership contest following Lady Thatcher's departure three years ago. He is 63, 13 years older than the prime minister. But he is still touted as a serious contender for No 10 Downing Street by those who cannot be convinced that Mr Major will recover. The foreign secretary has what they call 'grip'. Talking at the weekend at his elegant but unostentatious Oxfordshire farmhouse, Mr Hurd exuded the calm authority admired by his supporters. There were occasional flashes of complacency in his prognosis. Sometimes, it seemed, that after a week at the United Nations general assembly he found the Tory party's private wars an annoying distraction. But he acknowledged the significance of the Blackpool conference for Mr Major and the government. The crises triggered last year by Denmark's initial rejection of the Maastricht treaty and by the ERM debacle had subsided. 'Now we have come out of that, but it has left a certain weakness, a political malaise, behind.' So: 'This Blackpool week is important. It should mark and underline for everybody the move from one phase to another, from fever to recovery, from political fever to political recovery.' With Maastricht awaiting only German ratification, and the mood in the rest of Europe moving Britain's way the Conservatives had the opportunity to heal the divisions over Europe which had sapped Mr Major's authority. Mr Hurd spoke though with hope as well as expectation: 'The Tory party should be able (he emphasised twice the word 'should') - because that is no longer an argument and there is no particular focus for further 'barminess'  -to collect itself as it has often done in the past and get on with supporting the government.' He was determined that the problems should not be seen in isolation. The malaise was not unique to Britain. Ask President Bill Clinton or Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 'It is quite common in the western world at the moment. It occurs in more countries than not.' Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, he reckons, is the Ross Perot of British politics: 'If it were a malaise particularly against the government then the support would go to the alternative government. But it's not. It is going to a party (the Liberal Democrats) which is empty and contradictory, a receptacle for protest.' He warmed to the theme: 'I don't say we are OK, but we are not up against a great urge to replace one government by its alternative. That is very clear. The Labour party has done disastrously in by-elections. We are up against a feeling of suspicion, scorn, for politicians and politics.' That is as may be, but it is the government, and Mr Major in particular, who must climb out of what Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, calls a dreadful hole. The elderly facing VAT on domestic fuel, the southern middle classes ravaged by unemployment and soaring crime rates and teachers facing chaos in the classroom are not much interested in Chancellor Kohl's problems. Was not the problem that the government has no sense of direction? Could he define Majorism, 1990s Conservatism, or whatever? Mr Hurd is one of his party's thinkers but he is not impressed these days by the quest for philosophical blueprints. The government, he insists, will recover because it delivers answers to problems. 'People don't really think in terms of the party's identity. They think in terms of the actual events of their lives and the decisions of government which shape them.' Competence was the key: 'We will deal with this political malaise by the orderly and competent handling of different problems. I think that's perfectly possible. Indeed we have to do it.' The economy, of course, is central. So too will be Mr Clarke's November budget. If Mr Clarke entrenches economic growth with low inflation then few voters will worry about the government's philosophical label. Then there is Europe - more specifically Britain's opportunity to win the post-Maastricht argument for a wider, more open, decentralised Community. The Conservatives had the chance now both to bind their wounds and to shape the future of Europe. Mr Hurd offered a third, post-Thatcherite, theme for this exercise in pragmatic government: public services, 'how do you give them a respected place in a Conservative society. What (US vice-president) Al Gore called re-inventing government.' The prerequisite was reform - of the health service, education, the police and, above all perhaps, of prisons. But once the government was certain the reforms would stick, 'then you have to show the people who are in those services that they are a necessary and respected part of society.' It did not sound like a programme to raise the spirits of a depressed and disgruntled nation. After 14 years, a promise to get to grips with law and order or with standards in the nation's schools has something of a hollow ring. Mr Hurd was unapologetic. 'You exaggerate the extent to which people pine for intellectual excitement. I don't think they do. If we can sustain the recovery without inflation, if we shape the European Community in the sort of way we want, if we can make the health and education reforms stick and thus transform the nature of the public services . . . Then if we can do all those things, then I think we are doing a good job.' Would they accept too Mr Major continuing as prime minister, or has the 'nice man but not up to the job' jibe sunk too deeply into the nation's political consciousness? Mr Hurd sighs. The press, it seems, cannot cope without a crisis. 'We have run out of crises. There isn't a European crisis. There isn't an economic crisis. There isn't a sterling crisis . . . There isn't a crisis. But, my God, there has to be a crisis. So let's find a crisis. There's a leadership crisis, of course, the prime minister's not up to it . . . That is I think rather the process of thought.' But the fever will subside and Mr Major will stay: 'Yes I am sure he will. I can't think that any effort to displace him would be successful and I believe that he wishes to continue. And I think its right he should.' What then of Mr Hurd's own future? Barely a month passes without some newspaper story suggesting that he wanted more time for his young family, for writing novels, and even perhaps for his memoirs. The truth is Mr Hurd has not made up his mind. 'I am not in any tearing hurry to change. I don't feel under any huge pressure to do so . . . I'm blessed with a robust Anglo-Saxon constitution and I enjoy my job. There are other things I would like to do later but later is later. I can't really say more than that.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL FILE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1930 Born Marlborough.

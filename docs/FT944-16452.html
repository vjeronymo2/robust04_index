			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Economic Viewpoint: There ain't gonna be no tax cuts The UK Budget for 1995-96, to be presented on November 29, is unlikely to change the tax burden by more than is already planned as a result of previous Budgets. It will be called a neutral one - quite wrongly as the tax burden is increasing and will continue to do so. A bogus debate is however starting on whether the Conservative government should prepare to cut taxes in the following 1995 Budget. These would take effect in 1996-97, the last financial year before an election must be held. But there is one thing to get straight at the outset. In any sensible use of language, there will not be any tax cuts either in this Budget or the next one, whichever school of thought wins the debate. The only question is how large the tax increases are to be. The previous chancellor, Norman Lamont, announced in his Budget of March 1993 staggered tax increases to take effect in later years as economic recovery got under way. This was what I called the Augustinian policy of making the government's finances chaste, but not yet. The present chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, in his Budget of November 1993 added to the tax increases in the pipeline. The increases imposed by the two 1993 Budgets together will have raised the tax take by Pounds 15bn or more than 2 per cent of gross domestic product by the coming fiscal year, 1995-96. The aim was to reduce the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement from its post-recession peak of 7 per cent of GDP in 1993-94. This would involve, according to Treasury projections, taxes, excluding North Sea oil, rising from a low of 34 1/2 per cent of GDP in 1993-94 to more than 38 per cent by the late 1990s. In actual cash, and assuming very moderate inflation, we are talking about an eventual net addition to the tax burden of well in excess of Pounds 30bn - much larger than any conceivable 'tax cut'. Assuming the present government remains in office at least until 1997 (the last year for holding an election), the net effect of 18 years of Conservative government will have been to raise the ratio of tax to GDP by 4 percentage points over the level it inherited from the Callaghan Labour government. These trends were all in the official Budget documents and neither chancellor tried to hide them. But it took a campaign by Labour's Gordon Brown to make the public realise what was in store. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, in its Green Budget presented in collaboration with US investment bank Goldman Sachs, has a central estimate of the PSBR for 1995-96 amounting to Pounds 21bn, some Pounds 9bn less than the Treasury projected in its Red Book of a year ago. The improvement is, however, due to the effect of unexpectedly rapid recovery on revenue and unexpectedly low inflation on spending. It is therefore no reason for relaxing tax policy if one believes that that policy ought to be related to longer-run trends, and that cyclically induced fluctuations in government should be taken in their stride. But even if the influence of the business cycle were disregarded and the whole improvement were to be crudely handed back to the taxpayer, the latter would still be paying in tax a steadily rising proportion of her income. The only question is thus whether to limit - but certainly not to reverse - the size of the tax increases already planned and announced, which the public accepts, however grudgingly, that it will have to pay. Suppose however that in the November 1995 Budget Mr Clarke were to chance his arm by providing Pounds 5bn of what the headlines would wrongly call 'tax cuts'. What then? It does not take a prophet to say that these measures would largely take the form of widening the lower income-tax band and taking one or two percentage points off the basic rate. The net effect then of several Budgets together will have been a tax increase combined with a structural change. The latter will have involved a reduction in tax privileges for home-buyers, married couples and the like, and somewhat higher indirect taxes especially on fuel. The proceeds would have been used partly to reduce the budget deficit and partly to finance a slight reduction in the marginal income tax rate. The changes will, on balance, be an improvement but come as a side effect of raising rather than lowering taxes. The authors of the Green Book, however, far from favouring a reduction in the tax increases in the pipeline, lean on the contrary towards a further fiscal tightening. Their argument is that if real GDP growth averages near 3 per cent per annum - their central estimate - a risk-averse government would start to worry about the build-up in external debt arising from balance of payments deficits. Their prescription is to tighten fiscal policy more than is really required to slow down domestic demand and offset this by a monetary policy 'set to achieve an exchange rate consistent with some improvement in net exports' - code for further devaluation. My guess is that quite a few in the Treasury would like the chancellor to take this approach if they thought they could get away with it, but as a next best will settle for trying to sell it to a future Labour government. Yet on present evidence fiscal tightening would be just as foolish as the cosmetic tax cuts advocated by the Tory right. The whole external deficit scenario is highly speculative and downgrades sterling's highly competitive present real exchange rate. More fundamentally, a build-up in external debt, which emanates entirely from the private sector, is a matter for the private sector and is self-reversing. The Green Book's own projections show that public finances are moving in a sustainable direction and are most unlikely to be the source of an external deficit. In the second chart, projected public-sector deficits are compared with the creation of capital assets by the public sector. They show that the 'golden rule' - which says that public-sector deficits should not exceed capital formation - is likely soon to be achieved. Another test of soundness  -the stabilisation of the debt to GDP ratio - should be achieved still earlier. Indeed the chart shows that public sector finances have been fairly sensibly run under a series of chancellors. When the UK was recovering from recession in the early 1980s, there was a budget deficit. In the boom of the later 1980s the public finances went into surplus and the 'golden rule' was more than observed. Further deficits were incurred in the recession of the early 1990s which are again giving way to much smaller deficits and perhaps even surpluses. Goldman Sachs nowadays loses no opportunity of denouncing the tax remissions of the late 1980s. Yet at the time the firm was adamant that the budget surpluses of the period amounted to a tightening of policy even on a cyclically adjusted basis. Rough and ready attempts to set Budget objectives without being too much influenced by temporary fluctuations are more likely to succeed than more refined cyclical adjustments possible only with hindsight.</p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Vietnam Frontier Fund raises Dollars 50m Vietnam Frontier Fund, the latest investment fund aimed at the fast-growing economies of Indochina, has received commitments for Dollars 50m.

Only Dollars 25m of the Dollars 50m in commitments to the Vietnam Frontier Fund has actually been paid in, with the remainder on call from the investors. The new fund plans to take a particularly active role in creating and managing the companies and projects in which it buys a stake, and would be able to provide them with credit. 'Because issues such as training and control are critical to successful investment in Vietnam today, the managers of the fund will second staff as required to ensure that its investments are property nurtured,' the fund said. By providing stand-by letters of credit for new projects, the fund said it 'hopes to be able to provide one of the missing elements in the current Vietnamese investment environment'. The fund said it would open offices in the capital Hanoi and in Ho Chi Minh City, the southern commercial centre that includes Saigon, and would look at investments in real estate development, natural resources, banking and financial services, tourism, infrastructure and industry. Finansa Thai, a Bangkok-based merchant bank group, owns 70 per cent of the fund's management company. Stockbroker HG Asia has 20 per cent and N. X. Oanh Associates of Vietnam 10 per cent. Mr Eugene Davis, fund president, said: 'We plan to commit our first investment for the fund within the next month.'</p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Going may prove too heavy for Patten - How the odds stack up for the better-known runners TORY party chairman Chris Patten drifting in the betting like a drug-nobbled Derby runner. Movie queen Glenda Jackson turning in the performance of a lifetime. And Olympic gold medallist Sebastian Coe staggering badly in the finishing straight. These are three of the snapshots provided by bookmaker William Hill's list of celebrity election odds, covering 100 constituencies in which the tumult of tomorrow's UK election battle is proving most raucous. In Bath, puffy-eyed Chris Patten started the campaign a solid favourite at 1-3 (stake three to win one plus your stake back). But in concert with the Tories' waning electoral fortunes, the Conservative chairman's odds have skidded embarrassingly to 6-5. In contrast, actress Glenda Jackson, Labour's virgin-queen candidate in Hampstead and Highgate, has been promoted from 1-3 to a regal - and unbackable - 1-9. This did not stop one of Hill's client in Southend supporting the Oscar winner with a bet of Pounds 10,000 - plus Pounds 1,000 in betting tax - to win a paltry Pounds 325, described by Hill as one of the most baffling election bets ever struck. Because of the dire effect of betting tax, the true odds on this bet are a fraction under 1-34. In Falmouth and Camborne, the Tories' Sebastian Coe started the race at 1-4, but has wobbled so alarmingly that he is now rated only a 6-4 chance. In general, Hill's 100 celebrity seats contain a preponderance of high-betting marginals in which Tory candidates - especially incumbents - are under fire. Although bookmakers' odds are by no means infallible, they dramatise the struggle for survival facing a number of Tory stars. Transport secretary Malcolm Rifkind could be hurtling off the rails. Tiny Colin Moynihan, the former sports minister, may be taking a very early bath. Sir Nicholas Fairbairn is deep in trouble. John Taylor, the Tories' black candidate in Cheltenham, the snooty spa town, has drifted from 6-4 to 9-4. The odds against Anthony Beaumont-Dark have almost tripled, to 3-1. And even in blue-rinsed Kensington, Dudley Fishburn's odds have eased, though last night he was still the 5-6 favourite. All told, bookmakers expect an election turnover of Pounds 6m nationally, with a flurry of heavy bets today and tomorrow. In recent days the odds have stabilised, and now point firmly to a hung parliament. Hill's latest odds show Labour favourite to win most seats, at 1-4, with the Tories 5-2 and the Liberal Democrats 200-1. It is quoting 4-6 on a hung parliament, and 11-8 against Labour winning an overall majority. In Putney Keith Hagenbach, candidate for the Green party, has invested Pounds 250 on himself at 100-l to poll 6.2 per cent of the vote, which would be a record for the Greens. There has even been a flicker of interest in the Natural Law Party. William Hills' Graham Sharpe said last night: 'We have taken nearly Pounds 20 on Natural Law to win most seats at 50,000-1. We have no plans to trim their odds.'  ---------------------- CELEBRITY CHAIRS  ---------------------- Chris Patten Conservative Bath Was: 1-3 Now: 6-5  ---------------------- Anthony Beaumont-Dark Conservative Birmingham Selly Oak Was: 5-4 Now: 3-1  ---------------------- Simon Hughes Liberal Democrat Southwark &amp; Bermondsey Was: 8-11 Now: 2-7  ---------------------- Colin Moynihan Conservative Lewisham East Was: 11-8 Now: 3-1  ---------------------- Glenda Jackson Labour Hampstead &amp; Highgate Was: 1-3 Now: 1-9  ---------------------- Malcolm Rifkind Conservative Edinburgh Pentlands Was: 8-11 Now: 10-11  ---------------------- Sir Nicholas Fairbairn Conservative Perth &amp; Kincross Was: 6-4 Now: 2-1  ---------------------- Dudley Fishburn Conservative Kensington Was: 1-3 Now: 5-6  ---------------------- Sebastian Coe Conservative Falmouth &amp; Cambourne Was: 1-4 Now: 6-4  ---------------------- Rosie Barnes SDP Greenwich Was: 3-1 Now: 5-2  ---------------------- Michael Forsyth Conservative Stirling Was: 9-4 Now: 7-4  ---------------------- Alf Dubs Labour Battersea Was: 11-8 Now: 8-11  ---------------------- John Taylor Conservative Cheltenham Was: 6-4 Now: 9-4  ---------------------- Jim Sillars SNP Glasgow Govan Was: 11-8 Now: 5-6  ---------------------- Angela Rumbold Conservative Mitcham &amp; Morden Was: 1-2 Now: 5-6  ---------------------- Richard Livsey Liberal Democrat Brecon &amp; Radnor Was: 7-4 Now: 8-11  ----------------------</p>

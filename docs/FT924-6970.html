			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Arts: Travels With My Aunt - Theatre Wit is not the quality primarily associated with Graham Greene, though perhaps he became more light-hearted as he grew older. Certainly Travels With My Aunt, published in 1969, is a very witty novel. It is even better as a play or, more accurately, as a stage performance. The first stroke of brilliance on the part of Giles Havergal was to see that it could be acted at all. The second was to adapt it almost as a cabaret. There is a cast of only four: all men. Between them they switch parts and go through the whole delightful story from a funeral in a London suburb to a palace in Paraguay. Practically every line of dialogue is taken directly from the novel. In the book the tale seems slightly bizarre: an ageing Aunt Augusta, who has lost neither her money nor her sexual urge, picks up her nephew, a retired and reclusive bank manager, and takes him on her travels. The adventures include a brush with the CIA and the aunt's eventual marriage to an Italian Nazi collaborator, with whom she has been involved for most her life. Havergal's technique is simply to take sections of the dialogue and let the men speak it. Directing his own adaptation, he has chosen an impeccable cast. Of the four actors, Christopher Gee has only a few small parts, but his presence is necessary for the symmetry. All four are dressed in grey suits with waistcoats, white shirts, red tie and white pocket handkerchiefs. If there is any discrimination between the main three, it is that only Simon Cadell is allowed to play the aunt. He does it to perfection: voice slightly high-pitched, sometimes faltering, neck arched, stooping shoulders and some marvellously restrained movements with his arms and hands. Yet even Cadell plays more than one role. All the actors switch in and out of the part of Henry Pulling, the nephew, which is a wonderfully clever way of giving life to one of the least exotic characters. The most outstanding is John Wells who has a stage presence that will be forever associated with his impersonation of Denis Thatcher. It is in the smaller parts, male and female, that Wells and the other main actor, Richard Kane, excel. Kane plays Wordsworth, Augusta's black factotum and lover from Sierra Leone. Then he becomes Miss Paterson, the frail little spinster standing over the grave of Henry's father on a rainy day in Boulogne. There is a splendid vignette of all four of them in their grey suits and umbrellas as the Paterson story unfolds. Wells is both Tooley, the drug-taking, possibly pregnant daughter of the CIA man whom he meets on the Orient Express, then the girl's father whom he comes across on the way to Asuncion. By this time Pulling has passed back to Cadell. We should not forget that Greene was a narrative master, full of local detail like guarani. Even in this stage form, the story is never lost sight of. It is an evening to treasure and the novelist who never did quite so well as a playwright would surely have approved. Wyndham's Theatre, (071) 867 1116</p>

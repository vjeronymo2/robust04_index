			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Noel Irias] </F>   [Text] Larry Astorga, general coordinator of the JS  [Sandinist Youth Movement] and Deputy Coordinator Violeta  Delgado were unexpectedly fired Saturday during a JS National  Council session by a margin of one vote.    Roger Grijalva, a JS leader from Masaya, said the decision  was made because "there was an absolute void in the  organization's national leadership; we were isolated."    Nevertheless, doubts immediately emerged concerning the  political and legitimate validity of the decision. According to  JS sources who were at the session, the questions that have been  raised mainly involve the absence of two departmental  delegations at the session, the close margin by which the  dismissals were approved and the likelihood -- which has not yet  been proven -- that votes were cast by activists who are not  members of the organization.    Bayardo Arce, a member of the FSLN [Sandinist National  Liberation Front] National Directorate, was quite surprised by  the National Council's decision. Arce said he suggested that  the plenum stop focusing on internal matters and discuss youth  problems such as "the reversal of the revolution's achievements  at high schools, growing drug addiction, and the Atlantic coast  elections. I am going to inform the National Directorate so  that through our Secretariat an investigation can be carried out  to determine if the decision was legitimate and in accordance  with FSLN and JS laws and regulations," Arce said. According to  Arce, "the National Council should, at any rate, have held an  extraordinary National Assembly to reach a decision."    The vote was sheltered by an article in the JS charter which  gives the National Council the power to fire any leader. Of 86  members who were present, 45 voted in favor of the dismissals.  Grijalva, however, said the vote was 59 in favor and 23 against  the dismissals.    Sandinist Assembly member Rafael Henriquez, who was invited  to the session, questioned the propriety and validity of the  mechanism used by the National Council. "I do not know for sure  if the article calls for a qualified vote or if the Council has  the power to fire leaders appointed by the National Assembly."    According to Maria Ramirez, a member of the Sandinist  Assembly who was invited to the JS National Council session,  "the problem is political. At any rate a decision like this  should have been made by the National Assembly that elected  them. The difference of two votes indicates a lack of consensus  in the decision. Problems are not resolved this way."    According to Henriquez, "none of the arguments I heard  constituted grounds for dismissal. The problems of the JS and  its leadership are obvious and anyone who attempts to resolve  them will encounter the same difficulties." Henriquez, a former  leader of the JS and UNEN [National Union of Nicaraguan  Students], said "there was an undeniable problem with the  leadership of Astorga and Delgado, but it would be way too much  to blame them for the organization's problems."    According to JS sources consulted by BARRICADA, the  delegations from Rivas and Esteli did not attend the session and  two other departmental delegations withdrew following the vote.  "The delegations from Chontales and Chinandega did not protest  or explicitly express opposition during their withdrawal, but  their action was clearly a form of protest," the source said.    Grijalva argued that the delegations left for reasons of  time.    One person who attended the meeting said "this had been  brewing for months; it was a maneuver involving trends. The  real problem is that Astorga and Delgado had not sided with any  trend; they had their own perspective."    An FSLN source explained to BARRICADA that the crisis began  in 1993 when the JS leadership in Managua, headed by Vladimr  Soto, raised serious questions about the leadership of Astorga  and Delgado and attempted to break away. "The National  Directorate had to intervene and there was nothing the people in  Managua could do but go back together."    According to our sources, JS leaders from Managua, Masaya,  and Matagalpa led the vote in favor of the dismissals.    While preparations are made for the election of the  organization's top leaders, the JS National Council has  temporarily appointed a coordinating commission headed by  Enrique Pilarte and formed by departmental secretaries Francisco  Guzman and Roger Grijalva, with Gustavo Alegria as an adviser.    Astorga defeated Alegria in the JS directorate elections in  1992.</p>

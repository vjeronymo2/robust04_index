			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Venice Mayor Massimo Cacciari by Roberto </F> Bianchin; place and date not given: "A New Leader Right Away  Would Be a Mistake!" -- first three paragraphs are LA REPUBBLICA  introduction]    [Text] Venice -- The PDS [Democratic Party of the Left]  must not elect a secretary. At least, not for the present.  This, because it would be a mistake to continue along the path  of the past: "Another missed opportunity." This was said by  Massimo Cacciari. According to the philosopher and mayor of  Venice, the PDS must first hold a great convention of  nonconfessional voters and the Catholic Left to prepare for the  establishment of a new "left-wing democratic coalition." Only  after that, in October, should the party congress elect a new  secretary, on the basis of an "original" program and a "clear  and precise" political proposal. Meanwhile, the PDS would be  administered by a "committee of guarantors" comprising D'Alema,  Veltroni, Bassolino, and Vitali -- all potential secretaries --  and presided over by Napolitano or Trentin.    Cacciari is not running either for the secretaryship of the  PDS ("I do not even hold a membership card") or for the  leadership of the future left-wing coalition. But he is willing  to make his own "contribution," within the time limits imposed  on him. "I work 12 hours a day for 4 million lire a month as  mayor of Venice...." His office, on the first floor of Ca  Farsetti on the Grand Canal, is full of faxes arriving from all  over Italy, many from PDS members. Some people are insulting  him because of his criticism of [outgoing PDS Secretary]  Occhetto ("this is your last warning; stop it, or things will  turn ugly"), while others grant him their unconditional approval.    "I have some respect for Occhetto and for what he has done,"  Cacciari said. "The decision to change the name and the face of  the PCI [Italian Communist Party] was a historic and important  one, albeit belated, necessitated by events but conducted in  line with continuity with the past, with the old apparatuses."    [Bianchin] But you described him as a loser....    [Cacciari] Why not? Who won? It was a fact that he would  lose, and that the PDS was not proceeding quickly enough. Mine  was a political criticism, not a personal attack.    [Bianchin] What about his resignation ?    [Cacciari] It permits the start of a phase--in preparation  for the congress--within the PDS and a new phase for the entire  Italian Left. This is good; but Occhetto was not the problem.  The main problem remains the strategy that the PDS lacked, and  still lacks, and that the Left as a whole -- and I say the Left,  in a manner of speaking -- lacked, and still lacks.    [Bianchin] Why should the PDS not elect a new secretary  right  away?    [Cacciari] Because that would change nothing with respect to  the past, irrespective of who is chosen. I am saying that a  proper congress must be held for the entire progressive  alignment, and every effort must be made to involve not only the  nonconfessional Left but also the Catholic and European Left.  The purpose of the congress would be to discuss the status of  the Left and to devise a final option for federalism. It should  be a great opportunity for debate, which is what the PDS wants,  but it should involve the rest on an equal footing. This  decision must be made very promptly, by the end of July, so as  finally put an end to all the complaining, the attacks on the  government, and boorish, affected antifascism.    [Bianchin] So no secretary for the time being?    [Cacciari] It would be a bad thing and counterproductive. It  would mean electing a secretary just for the sake of doing so.  He would be merely the secretary of the old PDS, even if he  were God almighty. After all, there is no hurry, just a few  months, there is the summer.... The party can be led by a  committee of guarantors who will organize the convention and set  the pre-congress machinery in motion so as to hold a congress in  October, to discuss the result of the convention, to resume the  political initiative, and to organize and formulate a program of  its own at last, an original program. In this way the secretary  would emerge from this group and would be the expression of an  entirely new policy line. And it would be in his interest too  to be elected by a congress rather than a National Council  session.    [Bianchin] But some people say that the Left is already  dead....    [Cacciari] I am very optimistic. The political earthquake is  by no means over and is still fully under way. It is necessary  to display flexibility, cultural substance, and rapidity of  movement. For instance, it is necessary to start drawing a  distinction between party structures and the building of the  left-wing democratic coalition. Because in order to govern it  is necessary to form broad coalitions; it is necessary first to  define the relationship between the structures and leadership of  the coalition, which must be not a superparty but an electoral  and government alliance, led by its own candidates, not by a  coalition secretary. So it will be necessary to broach the  crucial issue of the coalition, of relations with the Catholics,  which means not negotiating with Segni or the PPI [Italian  Popular Party] but issuing a strong, true, and winning appeal to  those who really want to build a new policy. Because, despite  appearances, this can be done now.</p>

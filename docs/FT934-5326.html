			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: Slow progress towards recovery - Nikki Tait assesses a mixed series of results from Australia's banks It has been a mixed results season for the Australian banking sector. Red ink has been conspicuous by its absence, a sharp and welcome contrast to the situation a year ago. Interest spreads have generally improved and the benefits of cost-cutting are starting to show. But the earnings reports have failed to answer questions about the pace at which asset quality is improving, especially on the property front, or about the lacklustre state of the business credit market. Among the three big banks with September year-ends, National Australia Bank (NAB) and Australia and New Zealand Banking Corporation (ANZ) both did better than many industry analysts had predicted. NAB's results were especially glowing, with profits bounding over the ADollars 1bn (USDollars 663m) barrier. This puts the Melbourne-based institution in a select class of Australian companies; in the past, only Broken Hill Proprietary, the steel and resource group, has qualified as a billion-dollar earner. Conversely, Westpac disappointed. Restructuring costs featured far more prominently than at ANZ or NAB, and led to a ADollars 325.9m charge for abnormal items. After taking account of that, the bank was left with a slender net profit of ADollars 39.2m. The nation's smaller institutions, meanwhile, turned in creditable performances for the most part - or at least produced few unpleasant surprises. On the plus side, all three big banks could boast an improvement in asset quality and a decline in bad debt provisions, although in some cases the picture is still far from pretty. At NAB, gross non-accrual loans fell from ADollars 3.36bn to ADollars 3.15bn, while the charge to profit for doubtful debts was cut by a third to ADollars 604.2m. At Westpac, non-accrual loans were down from ADollars 3.57bn to ADollars 3bn, while the charge for bad and doubtful debts was 46.1 per cent of the previous year's figure at ADollars 1.29bn. But neither analysts nor the banks suggest that the going is about to ease. Westpac, for example, noted that 'the trend in charges for bad and doubtful debts will depend on whether there is a sustained improvement in economic conditions affecting . . . customers,' adding that conditions in the commercial property market would be 'particularly important'. Here, the prognosis is equivocal. Most lenders and agents report some upturn in sales activity. But they warn that the improvement is patchy, both by area and type of property; that some of the larger markets are still heavily oversupplied; and that prices are only just stabilising. One analyst also points out that the big banks have generally found it easier to offload relatively small property-related assets, and that large blocks of their portfolios remain illiquid. This, he suggests, is a problem of particular significance to Westpac. Meanwhile, on the lending side, the only significant growth came in the housing-related area. Falling mortgage rates, coupled with expectations of an improving economy, have led to a surge in interest from potential house-buyers. According to one survey released this week, 76 per cent of Australians reckon that this is a good time to buy a home. The problem for the lenders is that everyone is eyeing the same opportunity, and mortgage price competition is intense. Demand for business credit, by contrast, remains muted and corporate investment levels are extremely weak. 'The business community continues to give priority to further rationalisation of operations and achievement of efficiency improvements . . . total business credit actually contracted over the past 12 months,' noted Mr John Gough, chairman of ANZ. Macquarie Bank, a more specialised institution, said that 'in lending to the top end of the corporate sector, margins are being cut to the bone'. Inevitably, as the banks have concentrated on riding out the recession, cutting costs and resolving past problems, they have been inward-looking. Only NAB is thought to be in a position to consider significant expansionary moves. Here, there has been speculation that the bank may add a US operation to the clutch of interests owned in the UK, Ireland and New Zealand. 'I think an acquisition is very live and, internally, they're quite keen,' says Mr Craig Turton, analyst at Pru-Bache. The caveat, he adds, is whether opportunities in the US have become less attractive following the recent wave of consolidations there, and the emergence of the 'super-regionals'.  -------------------------------------------------------------------                      AUSTRALIAN BANKS 1992-93         Profit after tax but before abnormals (Adollarsm)  -------------------------------------------------------------------                         Year to     Year to     Capital ratio                         31.9.93     31.9.92     1993     1992  ------------------------------------------------------------------- ANZ                       459.7       578.1    10.8%     9.0% Nat Australia Bank      1,070.1       801.7    11.1%    11.6% Westpac                   365.1     2,038.1    12.3%     9.7% Commonwealth Bank has a June year-end  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company reports  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 20 Apr--During Wednesday's meeting between  Lech Walesa and the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] parliamentary  floor group, the president announced a return to cooperation  with the SLD in order to create a new constitution of the Polish  Republic. "A manly decision: We are returning to cooperation,"  Walesa said, adding that he took as an apology the floor group  leader's acknowledgment of the president as the author of the  citizens' constitutional initiative.    Kwasniewski said that "we willingly hand to the president"  the authorship of the citizens' initiative. "If it is taken up,  it will only be of advantage to constitutional work. I think it  would be worthwhile to stop all of this ill-feeling in the  interests of work on the large Constitution," the head of the  SLD parliamentary floor group said.</p>

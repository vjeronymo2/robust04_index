			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are, however, some differences between Standard No. 301 and Standard No. 303. For instance, as noted above, CNG fuel leakage is determined by the post-crash pressure drop in the fuel system instead of by fuel spillage. The amount of allowable pressure drop is to be based on the volume of the CNG leakage that either (1) is equivalent in energy content to the amount of gasoline leakage permitted by Standard No. 301, as calculated by the pressure drop formula <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  or (2) 1062 kPa (154 psi), whichever volume is greater. Another difference with Standard No. 301 is that a static rollover provision has not been included in the CNG Standard because while such a procedure can affect the leakage of a liquid fuel, it has no affect on the leakage of a lighter-than-air gaseous fuel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The formula is set forth in S5.2(a)(2) and discussed in the sections titled ``Problems with measuring small pressure drops,'' ``Test temperatures,'' and ``Test pressures.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each specific issue about the fuel system integrity requirements for CNG vehicles will be discussed later in this notice. These issues include the applicability of the vehicle requirements, the practicability of measuring small pressure drops, the test time, the test temperature, leakage from components in the fuel system, evaluating vehicles that have more than one fuel system, and the test conditions including the test pressure and test gas. The notice also discusses the agency's decision not to adopt requirements regarding certain matters, including static rollover, refueling connections, fuel storage retention, venting, leakage detection, and warning devices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule assures crash integrity of the vehicle which is comparable to that required in Standard No. 301. In addition, NHTSA recognizes that additional safety precautions may be required because of the unique concerns with high pressure fuel containers and the failure modes to which they may be subject. Thus, in addition to this final rule, NHTSA has issued a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) addressing the burst test for CNG containers (58 FR 68846, December 29, 1993). Based on comments to that notice and comments to the January 1993 NPRM, the agency anticipates issuing another final rule in the near future that will specify requirements regulating a CNG container's strength, durability, and venting. Moreover, based on comments to the NPRM and other available information, the agency anticipates issuing a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) that would propose performance requirements addressing a CNG fuel container's internal corrosion, brittle fracture under low temperature conditions, external damage, and fragmentation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Applicability of the Vehicle Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Gross Vehicle Weight Ratings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA proposed to apply the CNG Standard to passenger cars, multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks, and buses with a GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less, and to school buses, regardless of their GVWR. This applicability is identical to the applicability of Standard No. 301. In the NPRM, the agency tentatively stated that it would be inappropriate to apply the fuel leakage limits to CNG vehicles that have a GVWR greater than 10,000 pounds other than school buses, because barrier crash tests are not currently required for liquid-powered vehicles that have a GVWR over 10,000 pounds other than school buses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Navistar, Amoco, Transportation Manufacturing Corporation (TMC), Chrysler, Thomas Built, and Flxible agreed with the agency's proposal to apply the CNG vehicle requirements to light vehicles and school buses. Washington State and Blue Bird commented that non-school buses should be treated the same as school buses and thus be subject to the new CNG Standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has decided to apply Standard No. 303 to light vehicles and to all school buses. The agency's objective in regulating the fuel system integrity of CNG vehicles is to provide the same level of safety as that provided by Standard No. 301 for liquid fueled vehicles. Accordingly, the agency has decided to specify the same applicability for CNG vehicles as Standard No. 301 specifies for gasoline and diesel vehicles. The agency disagrees with comments favoring the application of the CNG standard to non-school buses with a GVWR over 10,000 pounds. As explained in the NPRM, NHTSA does not currently include any vehicle over 10,000 pounds, other than school buses, in its crash test requirements. NHTSA further notes that because the anticipated requirements for CNG fuel containers will apply to containers equipped on all vehicles regardless of GVWR, CNG-fueled heavy vehicles will be equipped with fuel containers that have been certified to comply with that equipment standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

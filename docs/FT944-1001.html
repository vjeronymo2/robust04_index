			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / UK Company News: RJB 'pleased' with share sale outcome Private investors have taken up fewer than a sixth of the shares available to them in RJB Mining's sale of shares to fund the purchase of British Coal's English regions. RJB said applications for 2.67m shares had been received in the public offer for sale in which private investors and employees were invited to subscribe. This represents 43 per cent of the first 6.25m shares in the public offer; however, the company had said that another 12.5m shares would be made available if there was sufficient demand. RJB said it was pleased with the result, given current market conditions and the 'contested nature of the bid' - a reference to rival bidders' strong criticism of the Pounds 815m paid by the company. It said its fund-raising had always been aimed primarily at institutional investors and these had proved extremely receptive. All 125m shares being issued have been placed with institutions. Those applied for by the public will be clawed back. The successful placing, announced by the company a fortnight ago, was regarded a considerable achievement even by RJB's rival bidders in view of the adverse publicity surrounding the bid and the company's projections for future markets. RJB, led by chief executive Mr Richard Budge, is forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 220m a year by the end of the decade on the assumption that it will be selling 34m tonnes of coal from the regions it is buying. Some critics say even 25m tonnes would be optimistic. The application for 2.67m shares in the public offer includes 281,000 for employees. A further 848,000 shares are being allocated to eligible employees under a free employee share offer. About 64 per cent of employees have already taken up free shares. RJB will continue to accept applications until December 29. The new shares are being issued at 320p, against a suspended share price of 348p. Dealing recommences on December 30, when RJB is due to take over the regions it is buying.</p>

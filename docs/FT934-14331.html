			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Russians admit dumping N-waste RUSSIA'S environment ministry yesterday admitted that a Russian tanker was dumping nuclear waste into the ocean north of Japan. It said international authorities had been informed in advance. Deputy environment minister Mr Amirkhan Amirkhanov said interested governments had been told about the dumping and the level of radiation in the waste was very low. Japan said it was concerned after Greenpeace revealed that the waste was being dumped. According to the environmental group, the Russian vessel started pumping liquid waste directly into the sea west of Hokkaido, northern Japan, yesterday morning. The waste was mainly reactor coolant and cleaning water from the Russian Pacific fleet's dilapidated nuclear submarines, said a Greenpeace ship following the tanker. Greenpeace measured airborne radiation at around 10 times background levels around the Russian ship. Sensitivity over environmental issues is increasing in Japan, where anxiety is especially centred on pollution imported from neighbouring countries, such as acid rain from Chinese nuclear power stations and seaborne nuclear waste from Russia. The dumping, in apparent violation of a 1983 international moratorium over the dumping of nuclear waste at sea, could add fresh strain to sensitive relations between Japan and Russia. It comes just a week after relations had improved, thanks to a successful visit to Tokyo by President Boris Yeltsin. Mr Yeltsin and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, voiced 'serious concern' over the ocean dumping of radioactive waste, in a joint declaration last week. They agreed to investigate nuclear dumping in the Sea of Japan by the former Soviet Union.</p>

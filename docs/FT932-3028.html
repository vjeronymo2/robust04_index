			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: BT SG Warburg's attempts to tighten its grip on BT3 are a quantum change from past practice on the handling of new issues. If stock exchange members agree to Warburg's request to move to cash settlement, it will become much harder to short BT shares. Indeed, it would be interesting to know whether money brokers have also been asked not to lend stock to those shorting the BT issue. The rapid flow of information about changes to the BT share register will also help deter selling. Given that there are so few privatisation mandates left to win, Warburg's pressure may be unwise. And while shorter settlement is in principle a good thing, why should the Stock Exchange single out BT for special treatment?</p>

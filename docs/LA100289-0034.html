			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS;  </P> <P> PBS TAKES A WRONG TURN WITH NEW 'TRAVELS' SERIES  </P> <P> Judging from the first and third episodes of PBS' new "Travels" series (9 p.m.  on Channel 28, 8 p.m. on Channel 15), you'd be better off watching "2 on the  Town."  </P> <P> In tonight's opener, "The Waters Are Wide: A Journey to Tristan da Cunha,"  we're stuck on a mail boat with series executive producer John Heminway on the  way to the South Atlantic's most remote island. Once we get there, Heminway  notes, the small community treats him like an intruder. No wonder, considering  that the first question we see our host asking a native on a lonely road is  "Where are you taking those cattle?" -- followed by "Where are you taking them  from?"  </P> <P> Like "Great Railways" and other such (superior) highfalutin travel series, this  initial episode of "Travels" is one of those "personal journeys" that depend as  much on who's taking us along as on where we're going. And because Heminway is  a dull, awkward, slightly pretentious guide, the series gets off to a dull,  awkward, slightly pretentious start.  </P> <P> The second episode was not made available, but the third, "East Meets Wax,"  doesn't offer much hope of improvement. This time around it's an obscure  comedian, Ruby Wax, who takes us to Moscow to watch her try her shtick on the  Soviets. Even before being mangled by her translator/foil, her lines aren't  funny. Maybe that's why the show's tone suddenly shifts to dull seriousness as  she discusses the housing problem with a resident.  </P> <P> At least the third episode, unlike the first, is intentionally bizarre. Other  "Travels" may prove more rewarding, but be sure to pack your life preserver.  You may want to jump ship before long on this trip. TERRY ATKINSON  </P></p>

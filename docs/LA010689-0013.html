			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  SHELTER TO HOUSE ARMORY'S HOMELESS  </P> <P> The Bell Homeless Shelter for the next three days will provide shelter to  between 50 and 75 homeless people who lost their emergency quarters when the  California National Guard armory in Long Beach became unavailable, officials  said Thursday.  </P> <P> Salvation Army Capt. David Hudson, administrator of the Bell shelter, said a  Los Angeles County official asked him to make room for the extra people from  Long Beach. Hudson said the 18,000-square-foot facility, a remodeled federal  warehouse, is already providing shelter to about 230 people. But if the weather  continues to be rainy and cold, the shelter's ranks could swell to more than  300, he said.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County officials have been informed that the National Guard plans  to use the Long Beach armory for routine drills on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  </P> <P> Under a state program, the armories normally are given over to the homeless  whenever temperatures drop below 40 degrees in dry weather and 50 degrees in  rainy weather.  </P></p>

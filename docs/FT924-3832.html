			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Bonn calls for safe havens GERMANY wants the European Community and the United Nations to establish safe havens in Bosnia-Hercegovina to stop further destruction of the republic and dissuade Islamic countries from arming Bosnian forces, officials in Bonn said yesterday. They also said the war in the former Yugoslavia could spread if the EC failed to find a compromise with Greece over what an independent Macedonia should be called. The dispute is holding up the Community's recognition of Macedonia. The officials, speaking at the end of the two-day Franco-German summit in Bonn between President Franc,ois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl, admitted any decision to set up safe havens would require tens of thousands of troops deployed under the UN flag. France and Germany are together carving out a 'mini' safe haven in the north-western corner of Bosnia, around Bihac. Mr Mitterrand and Mr Kohl called on the EC to find a rapid solution to the Macedonian question. Macedonia will be discussed at the pre-Edinburgh summit meeting of foreign ministers which opens in Brussels on Monday. outcome will determine whether Macedonia should be placed on the agenda at Edinburgh. Britain's Lord Owen, a key participant in efforts to bring peace to the former Yugoslavia, warned Nato yesterday that war could soon spread in the Balkans and that the west had to decide where to draw the line, Reuter reports from Brussels. A Nato spokesman said Lord Owen, co-chairman of the Geneva peace conference, told a restricted meeting of ambassadors from the 16 alliance nations that the situation was 'grave and sombre'.</p>

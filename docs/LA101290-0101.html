			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Trump Seeks to Restructure Loans: Developer Donald J. Trump is seeking to  restructure $100 million in casino bank loans, a spokesman said. The move comes  just two months after a bank rescue package was stitched together to keep his  real estate and casino empire from unraveling.  </P> <P> Trump, whose holdings are burdened with more than $3 billion in debt, has been  trying to reduce interest payments on his bank loans and junk bonds. Current  talks focus on borrowings used to buy two of Trump's three Atlantic City, N.J.,  casinos, the Trump Castle and the Taj Mahal, the glitzy property which opened  earlier this year. He also owns the Trump Plaza casino, which is healthier than  the other two. "We are having conversations with bank lenders at the same time  we are talking with bondholders," said Trump's chief financial officer, Stephen  Bollenbach.  </P></p>

			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Arts (Openings): Worldwide The Rolling Stones, or rather the four remaining after the defection of bassist Bill Wyman, take to the road again on August 1 in Washington DC to plug a new album, their first in five years, for new record company Virgin. Voodoo Lounge is released worldwide on Tuesday. Mick Jagger's snarl is as leering as ever; Keith Richard's guitar as aggressively jangly. Darrell Jones sits in for Wyman but hardly changes the format. This is the Stones in traditional mood, a capsule of raw, urban, early rock and roll.</p>

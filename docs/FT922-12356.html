			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / North Sea gas project approved CONOCO, a subsidiary of US group DuPont, and Total Oil, the French resources group, have been given approval for a Pounds 400m gas project in the North Sea in a development that could open up large additional reserves in the area. Conoco estimates that potential gas reserves around the new development, which is 180km off the Lincolnshire coast, are as high as 2,000bn cu ft. The two companies plan to develop separately the Caister and Murdoch gas fields in the southern part of the North Sea and build a gas gathering and pipeline system as a joint venture. Lasmo, Arco and Canadian Oxy are minority partners in the project. Caister is estimated to contain 320bn cu ft of gas and 2m barrels of gas condensate, and Murdoch has reserves of 300bn cu ft of gas and 3.5m barrels of condensate. Gas from the complex will start to flow in the last quarter of next year, reaching a peak in 1994 of 300m cu ft a day. The pipeline system will have capacity to carry 750m cu ft of gas a day and will be able to link with new discoveries in the area. Caister gas is already sold under contract to National Power, the electricity generating company, and negotiations are at an advanced stage on the sale of gas from the Murdoch field to the UK industrial market.</p>

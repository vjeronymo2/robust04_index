			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / International Company News: Aramco negotiates Greek oil stake Greece's Vardinoyannis group is negotiating the sale of up to 50 per cent of Motoroil Hellas, its oil refining company, to Aramco, the Saudi Arabian state oil company. It would be the largest foreign investment in Greece for several decades. It would also be Aramco's first investment in Europe, although private Saudi interests earlier this year took over Sweden's OK Petroleum group, the Nordic region's largest refiner. Motoroil, owned by two Panama-registered companies which belong to members of the Vardinoyannis family, controls Greece's largest private refinery with capacity of 4.5m tonnes annually. The Motoroil refinery near Corinth in southern Greece supplies a chain of 600 petrol stations around Greece controlled by the Vardinoyannis group and exports oil products through a separate trading company. Analysts in Athens said the refinery, which was modernised five years ago, is valued at over Dollars 400m. Aramco has long been seeking a European refining and marketing outlet. Such a development would be in line with a trend among many state oil companies to develop downstream networks in their main crude oil markets. Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, for example, has built an extensive European refining and marketing network under the Q8 brand. Aramco is a partner in the Star downstream joint venture with Texaco in the US. It recently acquired a 40 per cent stake in Petron Corporation, the leading oil company in the Philippines. Previous Aramco overtures to European refiners have generally foundered over failure to agree a price. Aramco's European ambitions have, however, been pared back recently. This is because of the maturity of the European market, a shortage of investment funds due to relatively low crude oil prices and a shift in strategic emphasis to Asia, the world's fastest-growing oil market. Analysts say Dollars 400m would be a good price for the refinery. The location would give the Saudis a European base relatively close to home and well positioned to supply new markets in eastern Europe. Motoroil posted profits last year of Dr6bn (Dollars 25m) on turnover of Dr189.2bn. The Vardinoyannis group operates one of Greece's largest tanker fleets, but has diversified into banking and services since 1990.</p>

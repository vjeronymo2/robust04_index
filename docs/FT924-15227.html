			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Bank's assets are frozen PROVISIONAL liquidators brought in to the London-based Mount Banking Corporation by the Bank of England at the weekend froze its assets yesterday. None of the 3,000 depositors, most of whom appear to be Kenyan Asians resident overseas, will be able to withdraw money over the next few days while the financial position of the bank is clarified. The Bank of England took the highly unusual step of applying to the High Court on Saturday for a winding-up petition. Mr Tim Hayward and Mr Philip Wallace of KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, were appointed joint provisional liquidators. Mr Tudor Roberts, company secretary and one of the solicitors to Mount Banking, said last night that the petition was issued 'without notice' and that the directors 'know of no grounds to explain the shutdown' of the bank. The Bank of England has powers under Section 92 of the 1987 Banking Act to apply to the High Court for a winding-up petition as laid down in the 1986 Insolvency Act. In a statement issued at the weekend, it emphasised that it did not allege insolvency as one of the grounds for the petition, and was acting in the interests of depositors on 'just and equitable grounds'. Mount Banking also meets another requirement for authorisation - the so-called 'four eyes criterion', in other words that there is more than one person controlling the business. Mount Banking has six directors. That leaves two other issues: whether a bank is conducting its business prudently, and whether the directors and managers have exercised fit and proper control for the positions they occupy. The Bank of England is shortly to present further details to support its petition to the High Court, and could apply as soon as next week for liquidation. Mount Banking was authorised by the Bank of England in 1983. Of its depositors, only about 50 are resident in the UK. Deposits in the bank total more than Pounds 166m. The provisional liquidators said yesterday that they expected 'substantially all' the creditors to be repaid. Any new deposits will now be controlled separately until the position is clarified. According to the latest set of accounts for the year to March 31 this year, the bank made a loss of Pounds 900,000, compared with a loss of Pounds 678,000 in the previous 12 months. Total assets of the group were Pounds 200.5m, against liabilities of Pounds 170.7m. Mount Banking has a Cayman Islands subsidiary called Mount Bank Cayman, which has about Pounds 10.5m in assets. The remaining shares are held directly by I&amp;M Holdings, a trust based in Jersey, which is also the ultimate parent of the group. The beneficiaries of the trust are the Shah family, of which three members are on the board. These directors are Mr Dilip Chandulal Shah, the general manager, who lives in London; Mr Navinchandra Bhagwanji Shah, deputy chairman; and Mr Suresh Bhagwanji Raja Shah, chairman, who both give addresses in Kenya.</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELLIOTT'S PAC-10 MARK SHOULD GET AN ASTERISK  </P> <P> While I agree that Sean Elliott is quite a basketball player and scoring  machine, it would logically appear to me that either he, Reggie Miller and the  other top Pac-10 scorers should have an asterisk by their records, or Lew  Alcindor should have one.  </P> <P> Alcindor made his record in three seasons, while the others took four.  </P> <P> Fair is fair.  </P> <P> RON SEERY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

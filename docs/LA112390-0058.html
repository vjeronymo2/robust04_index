			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> MULTIFACETED NINJA TURTLES PROVE PERFECT ARENA ROCKSTERSRINCON RECORDS AND  MATTEL INC. JOINTLY ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT THE NEWLY FORMED RECORD LABEL HAS  SIGNED BARBIE, ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST POPULAR AND RECOGNIZABLE DOLLS FOR OVER  30 YEARS, TO AN EXCLUSIVE RECORDING AGREEMENT. -- PRESS RELEASE, NOV. 12, 1990  </P> <P> To borrow a phrase: I have seen the future of rock 'n' roll, and its names are  Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Donatello and Raphael.  </P> <P> Having conquered Saturday-morning TV, the toy stores and the movies, the  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have moved on to the next inevitable avenue --  music -- and, in its current one-dimensional state, it's the perfect vehicle  for them.  </P> <P> At the Universal Amphitheatre on Wednesday night, in the first of nine shows  there, the Ninja Turtles did a dead-on parody of flat, pumped-up arena rock,  and made it seem more genuine in all their reptilian pseudo-naivete than a  similar show by such experienced human hands as, say, Slaughter.  </P> <P> The up-from-under-the-streets imagery in the already double-platinum album  "Coming Out of Our Shells" ("We just kept practicing / We stayed underground /  'Cause singin' in the sewer / Is a wonderful sound") is nearly as funny as the  up-from-the-streets self-mythologizing of a Bon Jovi.  </P> <P> Purists will object, of course. But how far back do you have to go to remember  a time in which rock 'n' roll cartoonishness wasn't a redundancy? Hasn't it  always been easier to think of Milli Vanilli as life-size representations of  animated figures, like Charlie Brown at the Ice Capades, than as real people?  Isn't even Luther Campbell basically Fritz the Cat personified?  </P> <P> Speaking of the Milli boys, though, there is one potential chink in the  Turtles' shells, for, at the opening-night show, not everything was as it might  have seemed.  </P> <P> Lead guitarist Michaelangelo's three-fingered picking technique sounded  suspiciously like a normal five-fingered technique, and more often than not  instruments were abandoned altogether while the music played on.  </P> <P> Is the show completely live? If not, can the youth of America stand any more  disillusionment? Dare we ask if the Ninja Turtles -- we'll say it in pig-Latin  so the kids can't hear -- iplay ynchsay? For that matter, do turtles have lips?  </P> <P> In a recent interview with New York's Newsday, Michaelangelo addressed the  question by comparing the Ninjas' approach to that of several popular dance-pop  artists. "When we don't have a lot of things to do on stage, we are singing,"  he said. "But when we have some dancing to do . . . we have tracks going so we  can give the best performance."  </P> <P> If impenetrable green masks left the issue a mystery, there was no question  that Sherie Scott, playing ace reporter April O'Neil in the show, was singing  live, and very well, for her lone ballad. Also very much live and apparently  ad-libbing was the villainous Shredder, who interrupted the show mid-way in his  ongoing plot to destroy the Ninjas and their mystical rat master Splinter.  </P> <P> Shredder drew boos from the small fry but, as far as the parents present were  concerned, had all the best lines. ("Turtles, fasten your kneepads -- it's  going to be a bumpy night! April, I'm going to get you, and your little rat  too!") He even "shredded" a Flo and Eddie album, claiming he hates those other  Turtles too.  </P> <P> Mom and Dad may feel the urge early on to drown their turtlemania in a good,  stiff drink. Don't count on it: Even the Amphitheatre's bars have been taken  over for use as merchandise counters. Sticking around, though, the folks may be  pleased to learn that an occasional bit of dialogue has been thrown in  expressly for them and that, as these experiences go, this well-paced,  well-produced show is a relatively painless one.  </P> <P> A lot less painful than it'll be taking the kids to see Poison when they get a  few years older, anyway. Count your blessings, and have another slice of  pepperoni.  </P></p>

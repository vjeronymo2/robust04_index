			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Observer: Bulls rush in Don't believe those stories about Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil taking his eye off the ball. Although he has been doing his job for more than a decade he remains very much a hands-on operator judging by a remark he made at a conference on information highways yesterday. Neil says he reads the proofs of his paper's weekly astrology column and changes the predictions for people born under Gemini, his sign, if he doesn't like the look of them. 'All Geminis are assured of a good future in The Sunday Times,' joked Neil yesterday. This would be quite amusing except for the fact that Neil was born on May 21  -thus making him a Taurus, according to some astrological tables. Surely he doesn't tamper with everybody's stars?</p>

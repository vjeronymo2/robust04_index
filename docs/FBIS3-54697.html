			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Nikolayev article: "Russia's Peacemaking Role. </F> What Will It Be?"]    [Text] At the Rome session of CSCE Foreign Ministers  Council, the Russian delegation raised the question of giving a  legitimate status within the CSCE framework to the peacemaking  efforts of the Russian Federation and the CIS. While  recognizing the existence of the real threat to international  security emanating from the interethnic conflicts which are  erupting in the former USSR and giving de facto approval to the  actions of the Russian Federation, the Council of Ministers was  nevertheless reluctant to give its forces the status of CSCE  "blue helmets."    The Russian side's argument did not meet with understanding  from a whole series of delegations, first and foremost Ukraine,  a number of East European countries, Canada, and Norway. At the  session, the opponents of the legitimation in international law  of the actions of the Russian Federation's peacemaking forces  raised the hypothesis of the revival of Russian "neoimperialism"  and accused Russia of trying in this way to mask its true  intentions with regard to the new division of the Eurasian  continent.    It goes without saying that Russia, like any great power,  has  zones of traditional geopolitical interests and regions to which  it gives paramount attention. Our approach in this regard is  dictated not by an imperial ideology but by perfectly  understandable pragmatic considerations. It is obvious that the  creation in Russia of a successfully functioning market economy  mechanism is impossible without ensuring that market's normal  interaction. Russia's prime interest is in a normalization of  the situation in the neighboring former Union republics not only  in a military sense but also economically. It was  considerations such as those which has motivated Russia's  diplomatic efforts in New York, Rome, Brussels, and at other  international forums where it formulated practical steps on  peacemaking questions.    The charges of neoimperialism are groundless even if only  because Moscow, by bearing on its shoulders the full burden of  peacemaking in the post-Soviet area, is certainly not seeking to  operate in isolation. On the contrary, collective actions are  no less necessary in Nagorno-Karabakh, for example, than they  are in Yugoslavia. Russia operates in the "hot spots" not only  in its own interests but also in the interests of the whole  world community. That was confirmed at the 48th UN General  Assembly [UNGA] session and formed the main theme of the  decisions of the CSCE Foreign Ministers' Council.    It is obvious now that there are no alternatives to  increasing and strengthening Russia's peacemaking efforts in the  area of the former USSR. For Russia, the question is not  whether to engage in those activities or not. The question is  how to make those efforts more effective by utilizing UN  experience in regional conflicts and elaborating joint positions  with the CSCE. Incidentally, the latter need was tacitly  recognized by the participants in the Rome forum when they  acknowledged the CSCE's failure to convene a peace conference on  Nagorno-Karabakh.    Russia's peacemaking forces can offer evidence of the  considerable, albeit not absolute, success of its actions in the  Dniester region, Tajikistan, Ingushetia, and other regions. The  creation and strengthening of Russia's peacemaking structures is  being effected with the participation of the supreme councils of  the CIS member countries. Incidentally, the CIS countries'  joint peacemaking actions are carried out both on the basis of  bilateral and multilateral interim accords and of the recently  adopted "Agreement on the Groups of Military Observers and  Collective Forces for the Maintenance of Peace in the CIS."    Our peacemaking efforts also have an enormous  "humanitarian" advantage. Russians know best the specifics of  the political situation, are able to understand the genesis and  dynamics of a conflict, and are ready to effectively promote the  long-term stabilization of the situation.    Russia, furthermore, is acquiring its own unique  "fire-fighting" experience. For example, as distinct from the  existing rules of the CSCE, it is becoming the practice here to  enlist the opposing sides' forces in operations, and for our  armed contingents to use military force, although it must be  said not for the purpose of crushing the opposing sides in a  conflict but for self-defense.    This of course does not mean that Moscow is trying in some  way to crowd out potential foreign peacemakers. On the  contrary, the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry memorandum on  enhancing the CSCE's effectiveness in the peacemaking sphere  proposes preparing and concluding a treaty on the principles of  planning and implementing the kind of operations which would  envisage the formation of a joint paramilitary rapid reaction  corps and would create a common material base for operations.    While expressing full gratitude to the CSCE observers  working  in the conflict zones in Ossetia, the Dniester region, and  Abkhazia it has to be acknowledged that the existing CSCE  structures, geared as they are to the prevention of conflicts  and the maintenance of peace by means of preventive diplomacy,  cannot always give an adequate and rapid response to the  challenges of the present day. The search for the optimum  combination of the efforts of the CSCE and Russia, the  elaboration of the status of operations, and giving material  expression to that status will all take considerable time.  Unfortunately, that is what we do not have. That is why at the  48th UNGA Session and the Rome session Moscow's delegation  raised with particular persistence the question of giving  priority to easing the financial burden which the Russian  Federation is bearing in connection with the implementation of  peacemaking actions.    Clearly it has to be realized that in the specific  post-Soviet area purely Russian peacemaking actions cannot be  replaced by international financial support, no matter how  extensive it may be, or by the participation of any group of  countries in them. That view, it seems, is meeting with a  certain understanding among the leading Western countries.</p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Tepnel expects first product next June TEPNEL Diagnostics, which was floated on the USM almost 13 months ago, reported a maiden loss of Pounds 1.38m for the period from June 11 last year to this September. In the flotation prospectus, losses were forecast to be Pounds 1.28m. Turnover was Pounds 31,000 and the loss included Pounds 931,000 of research and development expenditure. Losses per share were 6p. Sir David Trippier, who became executive chairman a month after the float, said that the first product using Tepnel's Daras technology for the screening of DNA patterns of specific diseases would appear in June within the life science/clinical research market. Thereafter two other products using the technology would be launched into the infectious disease and cancer test market, and then by the end of 1995 Tepnel would introduce a product into the blood analysis market, which includes the Blood Transfusion Service. Sir David said that Tepnel's competitors' technology was 'behind ours for speed of testing and for quality, with no false negatives or positives'. He said that contracts had been signed with Strato Consulting of London and Pathway Laboratory Services at Leicester University to make the kits. The Faras (Food antibiotic residue analysis system) test range was behind schedule, as Sir David had announced at the interim stage, but was also forecast to be launched in June. At the float, Tepnel said the milk industry would be the first market to be addressed because of the expected EU directive on milk testing. That legislation has now been delayed until next year, so the Faras delay has had little detrimental effect. Sir David said the market was excited about Tepnel's 'technology sharing' agreement with Drug Screening Systems Inc, because of its drug of abuse screening product, especially in the light of home secretary Mr Michael Howard's pledge to screen prisoners for drugs.</p>

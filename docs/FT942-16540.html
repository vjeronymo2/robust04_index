			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / International Company News: Santana Motor to put viability scheme to unions Suzuki's struggling Spanish subsidiary Santana Motor will present its viability plan to unions and the Andalusian government on Monday, Reuter reports from Madrid. The meeting will centre on Suzuki's proposal to shed two thirds of the workforce to keep the southern Spanish plant going. The company wants its workers to agree to the plan, and the regional government to help with a capital injection. Workers, 2,000 of whom have been temporarily laid off, have blocked the factory gates at Linares for nearly two months. Suzuki says it cannot pay April salaries unless they let out some of the plant's finished vehicles.</p>

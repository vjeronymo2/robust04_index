			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ye. Gaydar, first deputy chairman of the </F> Government of Russia, by Tatyana Korostikova; place and date not  given: "What Will They Berate the Authorities For in the New  Year: Ye. Gaydar's Departure Facilitated an Abrupt Fall of the  Exchange Rate of the Ruble"]    [Text] This was the last interview which Ye. Gaydar  gave to ARGUMENTY I FAKTY before resigning from the position of  first deputy prime minister. However, he has not given up his  reformist plans, which he intends to implement in the position  of chairman of the Russia's Choice faction in the State  Duma.    [Korostikova] What will Russians have to go through in 1994?    [Gaydar] The perception of an ordinary person is always much  more critically disposed toward what is happening than a  detached, remote historical assessment. This is why events  should not be measured by whether they will praise or berate the  authorities (of course, it will be the latter), but rather what  they will berate the authorities for.    If they berate the authorities for:    --prices still growing, although the rate of inflation has  dropped;    --there being goods in the stores, but us being nowhere  close  to Warsaw yet, to say nothing of Brussels;    --the problem of employment becoming more acute;    --having to restructure production and master new products  with some difficulty;    --the peasants having difficulty selling their products  because of growing competition,    this will mean that the authorities are moving in the  right direction.    If they berate the authorities for:    --there being no goods at any price;    --money being worthless again;    --the ruble once again depreciating quickly against the  dollar;    --not being able to save money in rubles and having to  convert the money into dollars;    --the above being impossible to do because strict procedures  for currency operations have been introduced;    --no one filling state requisitions, despite their  reintroduction,    this will mean that the authorities are advancing along  a dangerous path.    In December we had a 12-percent inflation rate (the target  was 5-7 percent by the end of the year). This is why the  inflation control measures we have planned for 1994 do not  appear explosive to me. To be sure, we will have to pay for such  a monetary policy by a harsher reduction in the output of  uncompetitive products, but no unthinkable growth of  unemployment is expected, at least not in 1994. Unemployment  will increase gradually. Here is the experience of Estonia and  Latvia: at present, prices are growing there at the rate of less  than 1 percent per month, whereas unemployment does not go into  dozens of percentage points; it is the same as here.    [Korostikova] Yegor Timurovich, you are talking about  everything as if the Duma will not restrict the reformers in  anything. Compared to the Duma, the old parliament might seem a  cherished dream.    [Gaydar] No, the old parliament was no cherished dream. I  will remind you that in September we had a harsh conflict  between the parliament and the president; everything was moving  toward a political crisis. All edicts of the president were  immediately canceled. There was no budget for the fourth  quarter. A power vacuum emerged in the regions because all the  decisions of the center were torpedoed by the other branch of  power. In general, the power structure in Russia was paralyzed.    [Korostikova] Indeed, but at the time you had the  use-of-force scenario to fall back on, and now you do not.    [Gaydar] There is the constitution instead, which  establishes  the natural framework for the separation of powers, which  previously was not the case.    Of course, we (Russia's Choice) are a minority in the  parliament; however, with the help of the president's veto we  will be able to block the adoption of the most irresponsible  decisions that pose a danger to the country.    [Korostikova] What is the threat to Russian consumers from  new customs tariffs on imports? There was panic in Moscow before  New Year's day; they swept away even the most expensive  merchandise sold for foreign exchange.    [Gaydar] The adoption of new import tariffs has been  postponed until March. The tariffs need additional work. New  import duties should restrict imports we do not need, but they  should not be prohibitive in nature.    [Korostikova] Will they restrict imports of foodstuffs, too?    [Gaydar] Why should we, unlike all other countries of the  world, fail to protect our own agriculture? The issue is  different: To what extent should these duties be introduced, and  at what levels? The position of the agrarians, headed by  Zaveryukha, is: make the tariffs prohibitive, so that they will  teach everyone a lesson about importing anything at all to our  country. A majority of other ministries and departments advocate  a different point of view: tariffs should be made normal, that  is, presupposing a certain revenue for the budget and elementary  protections for domestic agricultural production, but by no  means prohibitive.    No matter what import duties are adopted, they will not  apply  to goods from CIS countries. We have signed free trade treaties  with them. This means an enormous amount of foodstuffs.    [Korostikova] Will there be any assistance for the producers  of goods that are needed?    [Gaydar] Several substantial preferences for them are found  in the Edict on Taxation which was recently signed by the  president. For example, if a small enterprise engages in a  priority type of activity, its profit tax will be reduced. Tax  relief will be provided for the profits of banks from long-term  credit extended for investment purposes.    Restructuring of the system of state support for the  investment activities of enterprises is planned. Money will not  be given for nothing to those who have managed to get through to  the necessary office, but rather to support promising projects  through either credit guarantees, stock purchases, or  supplemental state financing, in addition to internal and  private investment, and so on. The Ministry of the Economy has  already developed such a concept.</p>

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / The Markets: 'Death cross' looms for gold - Commodities Seasonal spirit among the world's gold traders could be dampened this week by what an analyst describes as an 'arithmetical sword of Damocles' hanging over their market. Mr Andy Smith, of the Union Bank of Switzerland, warns that the market needs to rally soon to avoid being caught in a 'death cross', which, according to technical theory, could signal a sharp price fall. This would occur, he says, if the 200-day moving average was crossed by the 50-day moving average while both were falling. A similar situation in the silver market in late November augured a sudden 15 per cent fall in that market. In New York, meanwhile, most gold analysts are expecting the market to remain dull next year, though they say an improving supply-and-demand outlook should sustain the modest firming trend of the past two years. 'The market has been in a better balance this year, and we are looking for growing supply deficits in the years to come,' Mr George Milling-Stanley, Lehman Brothers analyst, told the Reuters news agency last week. 'This scenario should be supportive of gradually rising prices.' Throughout 1994, the spot price of gold languished within a thin Dollars 30 band from Dollars 368 to Dollars 398 an ounce, far narrower than 1993's Dollars 80 range. De Beers, the South African group whose London-based Central Selling Organisation accounts for at least 80 per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, on Tuesday gives details of CSO diamond sales this year. Although it had record first half sales of Dollars 2.58bn, analysts suggest that the CSO eased back sales in the second half, so the 1994 total is not expected to be very different from last year's Dollars 4.366bn. Today marks the formal opening of the London Metal Exchange's new headquarters and trading ring at which Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, will do the honours.</p>

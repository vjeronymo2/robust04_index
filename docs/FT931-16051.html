			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Soaring interest rates take pressure off punt SELLING pressure on the punt eased slightly yesterday, as interest rates soared on the Dublin interbank money market. The doubling of the central bank's overnight rate to 100 per cent on Thursday forced up one-week rates for wholesale funds to between 80 and 100 per cent, effectively damping down speculative selling of the punt from overseas which had dominated trading on Wednesday and Thursday. In thinner trading than the previous two days, the punt was lifted from its ERM floor against the Dutch guilder in the morning, although it was forced back again by the afternoon. Raising its overnight rate has become the central bank's main weapon in defending the punt, since exchange controls were lifted at the beginning of the year. It is the rate at which the clearing banks are able to borrow funds if they are left short at the end of a day's trading, which is usually the case during heavy speculative attacks on the currency. Although it has no immediate impact on commercial lending rates, which are set on the basis of financial institutions' average cost of funds, it has put a severe squeeze on their margins and unleashed a battle for deposits. Depositors with sums as small as IPounds 5,000 were yesterday able to obtain interest rates in Dublin in excess of 25 per cent for one-month deposits, while larger sums were attracting rates as high as 40 per cent. In contrast, overdraft rates for businesses are currently around 16 per cent, while personal overdrafts are around 19 per cent. A spokesman for the Bank of Ireland, one of the main clearing banks, said yesterday: 'It will be very difficult to hold on to deposits if we are not out there competing for them.' He said an upward adjustment of commercial rates 'is not being actively considered at the moment. We have been living with this situation since last October, and we will wait as long as we can.' A number of building societies however are apparently considering raising mortgage rates, possibly as early as next week. The Finance Ministry yesterday reaffirmed that it has no intention of devaluing the punt, and there are now expectations in the market that a reimposition of exchange controls might be resorted to next week. The only alternative would seem to be that interest rates will continue to spiral upwards if the pressure continues.</p>

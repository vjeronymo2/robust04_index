			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Letter: Japanese buyer for County Hall best option, while LSE should have custom-built school Sir, You suggest the government is in a dilemma as to what to do about County Hall ('GLC spectre continues to haunt Tories', August 6). Would that all dilemmas were so clear cut and so easy to solve. On one side there is a respected Japanese businessman who wishes to create a luxury hotel out of County Hall. This will result in capital inflow, work desperately needed by the building industry and a business which, over the years, will contribute to the nation's economy. On the other side, the London School of Economics wishes to stretch its resources and borrow vast sums at a time when real interest rates are at record levels. Furthermore, the LSE proposals seem to be postulated on the sale of real estate within three years at what is generally acknowledged to be an incredible price. Dare one suggest the LSE faction wishing to go along this road is, although doubtless brilliant intellectually, perhaps a little short when it comes to common sense, let alone common prudence. If the LSE can really lay its hands on tens of millions of pounds for a new prestigious home, why not build a custom-built school using a renowned architect? At such a time as now, land, building and indeed professional services should all be available on highly competitive terms. Given this outcome all concerned will be winners and London will be able to boast of a fine new hotel and a fine new LSE. Christopher H Burt, 92 Rue de l'Aqueduc, 1050 Brussels, Belgium</p>

			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> TUSTIN GROUP WINS TOLLWAY STUDY  </P> <P> The agency overseeing planning for the Eastern tollway has agreed to conduct  new noise and air quality studies in the Peters Canyon area in order to settle  a homeowners' environmental lawsuit against the planned traffic project.  </P> <P> Filed in July by the Tustin Hills Homeowners Coalition, the lawsuit alleged  that the environmental impact report approved by the Board of Supervisors last  year was inadequate because it did not detail homeowners' exposure to expected  increases in noise and air pollution once the tollway is open to traffic in the  mid- to late 1990s.  </P> <P> The Foothill-Eastern Transportation Corridor Agency, which is supervising the  tollway project, and the homeowners group have accepted the terms of the  settlement, but county officials are still processing the paper work and have  not approved it, according to Donna Stubbs, the corridor agency's spokeswoman.  </P> <P> Under terms of the settlement, neither the county nor the corridor agency  admits any wrongdoing, but they agree to pay for the new noise and air quality  studies aimed at comparing existing noise and air pollution levels with what  will occur once the tollway opens -- using worst-case traffic scenarios.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> BILL STOUT, VETERAN CBS COMMENTATOR, DIES AT 62  </P> <P> Bill Stout, whose gravelly voice and acerbic manner proved both an endearing  and enduring aspect of television news and commentary through nearly four  decades, died early today.  </P> <P> The former anchor on KCBS-TV, the CBS-owned outlet in Los Angeles, who was most  recently known for his trenchant commentaries on the station, was 62.  </P> <P> He died at 9:30 a.m. at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center of cardiac arrest. He had  been admitted there Thursday night complaining of flu-like symptoms, said  hospital spokesman Ron Wise.  </P> <P> Stout, who was CBS News' West Coast correspondent for nine years in the 1960s  and early '70s and who had won several Emmys and numerous other awards,  suffered a heart attack two years ago. It forced him off the air for several  months.  </P> <P> Stout spent 39 years with CBS, nearly all of them at the network's Los Angeles  affiliate.  </P> <P> KCBS news director Michael Singer called Stout "irreplaceable."  </P> <P> "He represented the best that journalism has to offer," Singer said. "He was a  professional through and through and a keeper of that little flame that lights  up the dark for all of us."  </P></p>

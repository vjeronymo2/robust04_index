			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: SILKEN STYLE ON IVORIES WEARS WELL FOR  FLANAGAN  </P> <P> There are jazz pianists who make an immediate impression with their aggressive,  personal styles, and those who touch you in more subtle ways. McCoy Tyner, with  his percussive attack, and the often abstract explorations of Cecil Taylor fall  in the first category. In the second are players like the silky smooth Oscar  Peterson and the understated Tommy Flanagan, who opens a two-week run at  Elario's next Wednesday.  </P> <P> Flanagan's San Diego appearances seem even more interesting because of the  other players; George Mraz, who usually backs Flanagan on bass, canceled due to  illness, but bass man Charlie Haden, just finishing his own dates at Elario's,  has volunteered to stay on with drummer Lawrence Marable to play behind  Flanagan.  </P> <P> Since Haden and Flanagan have never worked together before, the combination  promises some spontaneous moments. Flanagan, though, made it clear who's the  main attraction. He doesn't expect the change in musicians to affect his sets  much.  </P> <P> "I'm gonna play what I usually play," he said by phone from his home in New  York, as his wife and manager Diana listened in, occasionally adding  information. "I expect we'll get along and have a good time doing it. I like  Lawrence. I worked with him the last time I was out there."  </P> <P> Flanagan, whose long career has included time with masters such as Kenny  Burrell, John Coltrane and Elvin Jones, leans heavily toward the classic songs  of mainstream jazz.  </P> <P> "I've been doing the same composers I've always played," Flanagan said. "Thad  Jones, Tadd Dameron. . . . "  </P> <P> "Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie," his wife added. "Thelonious Monk, Bud  Powell, George Gershwin. He has a very extensive repertoire. He won't repeat  himself."  </P> <P> Flanagan, a strong composer in his own right, has been too busy to write new  music lately, his wife said.  </P> <P> Though the songs remain largely the same, Flanagan believes his playing  continues to grow.  </P> <P> "I think it has matured," he said. "If you compare the version of 'Chelsea  Bridge' I did in 1957 with the one from 1974, I knew the song better 20 years  later. I think you can hear that. There's more meaning, more feeling."  </P> <P> Flanagan's last record was recorded at the Village Vanguard in New York two  years ago. A new album with Mraz and drummer Kenny Washington is due out in  March.  </P> <P> As for the younger generation, Flanagan said he is not jazzed with many of the  new crop of musicians. Pianist Mulgrew Miller is the only one who's impressed  him lately.  </P> <P> Flanagan's career has included roughly 250 albums as a sideman and 25 as a  leader, and through it all, he's remained faithful to straight-ahead jazz.  </P> <P> Asked whether we'll ever hear him play a synthesizer, he laughed. "No, you  certainly won't."  </P> <P> At 2 p.m. every Sunday, 75-year-old trumpeter John Best, who has played with  Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw and Benny Goodman, holds forth with clarinetist Bobby  Gordon at Jazz Mine Records and CDs in La Jolla. Though Best is  wheelchair-bound, his playing is far from handicapped.  </P> <P> "He has chops that won't quit," said Jazz Mine owner Walt Friederang.  </P> <P> Gordon, a well-known Dixieland player featured for years at Eddie Condon's in  New York, can be heard on a new album with the Hal Smith Trio. Besides the  Sunday jams, Friederang presents occasional shows on Mondays and Tuesdays. A  quartet featuring sax men Rod Cradit and Gary LeFebvre, with Gunner Biggs on  bass and Jim Plank on drums, will be featured Feb. 21 at 8 p.m. The four San  Diegans will play the music of sax legend Gerry Mulligan. Friederang's store  features rare jazz albums, including some of the 3,000 he was given by a former  owner of KJAZ, the Bay Area radio station. Developers hope to replace the Jazz  Mine with shops and condos, but until then, it is one of San Diego's last  bastions for pure jazz.  </P> <P> Los Angeles public television viewers will enjoy shows on Duke Ellington and  Art Blakey Feb. 17, but the programs aren't scheduled for viewing that night on  KPBS, San Diego's public TV station, which will, as usual, be airing a  Metropolitan Opera performance. A KPBS official said San Diego jazz fans aren't  getting shorted. The Ellington show aired last summer and will play again in  the next few months. The newer program on Blakey will also be shown in the  coming months. KCET in Los Angeles simply arranged to show it before it was fed  to the rest of the public TV network.  </P> <P> SHORT RIFFS: Vic's in La Jolla features sax man Joe Marillo Mondays through  Fridays, 5 p.m. to 8 p.m., and the Aubrey Fay Band Friday and Saturday nights  starting at 9, through February . . . Internationally known jazz critic Stanley  Dance, who lives in Vista, presents the fourth in the five-part jazz history  lecture series at the Athenaeum in La Jolla at 7 p.m., Feb. 20. Dance, who  collaborated with the late Duke Ellington on the master's autobiography, will  illustrate Ellington's musical career with some of his best records. Admission  is $11, or $9 for Athenaeum members. . . . Meanwhile, Dance's wife, Helen, who  produced some of Ellington's albums, is writing the memoirs of her life in the  jazz world for Smithsonian Institution Press. . . . The San Diego Jazz  Festival's Outreach Program begins Saturday night with concerts at 8 and 10 at  the Educational Cultural Complex by Jimmy and Jeannie Cheatham. . . . KIFM  hosts Tania Maria at the Bacchanal Sunday night at 8:30. . . . Lori Bell and  Flight 7 are the only local jazz musicians included on KIFM's February play  list. . . . Drummer Art Blakey put on a great show Sunday during a rare San  Diego appearance at the Bacchanal and a lot of people who should have been  there weren't. Promoter Rob Hagey said he sold only about half of the 550  tickets printed and took a loss on the show.  </P></p>

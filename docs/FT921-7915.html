			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Southdown BS incurs Pounds 9.8m loss Southdown Building Society incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 9.8m in 1991, after bad debt provisions of Pounds 14.1m. The loss was the fourth to be announced by a society in 1991. In November Southdown agreed to merge with Leeds Permanent after it was evident it was heading for a loss. Southdown said that about half the provisions were made against residential mortgage lending and the rest against losses on building finance and commercial lending. At the end of 1991, the society had assets of Pounds 746.3m. Members of the society will vote on the merger with Leeds at a special general meeting on March 11. Savers will receive a 1 per cent bonus on the lowest balance in their accounts between November 23 and the merger, and borrowers will be given a 0.5 per cent cut in their interest rate for six months.</p>

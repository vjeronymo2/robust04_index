			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / People: Barclays beefs up bancassurance Barclays Bank, which calculates it is already Britain's fourth largest provider of unit-linked life insurance and pensions products, has moved to strengthen its management team with its eye on moving further up the league tables. Bancassurance, the sale of life and pensions products through bank and building society outlets, is forecast to grow to 30-50 per cent of the total market by the end of the decade and all four major UK clearers have announced their intentions to be serious players. Barclays Financial Services has recruited as sales manager Keith Strudley, 48, from rival Midland Bank where he played a key role in expanding and developing distribution channels. Strudley has had a long career in bancassurance, having spent 15 years at TSB as a regional sales manager. Barclays has also recruited Phil Smith as finance director for its financial services unit. Smith had previously occupied a similar position at Prudential Assurance Company's general insurance division.</p>

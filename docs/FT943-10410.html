			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Cost of rail sell-off advice criticised The government has squan-dered enough money to settle the rail dispute on payments for advice on rail privatisation to a single firm of City solicitors, Labour said yesterday. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, said a total of Pounds 16.8m had been spent on privatisation advice. One-third of this - Pounds 5.6m - had gone to solicitors Linklaters &amp; Paines. This sum would 'easily settle the present signalling dispute'. Mr Dobson published a list of 12 firms to which the Pounds 16.8m had been paid. He said two firms - Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Putnam Hayes &amp; Bartlett - received Pounds 2.5m between them for advice on access charging. The outcome had been 'so unsatisfactory' that the regulator had commissioned new studies. Dewe Rogerson had been paid Pounds 700,000 for advice on marketing but the company had 'since been replaced'.</p>

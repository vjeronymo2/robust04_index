			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A 23-year-old Michigan man was arrested on suspicion of driving a stolen  vehicle after he lost control of a 1984 Chevrolet Corvette on California 52  just east of Interstate 5, the California Highway Patrol reported.  </P> <P> CHP Officer Jeffrey Newsome said the driver, identified as Robert L. Fischer,  was spotted driving a suspected stolen vehicle by a San Diego police officer,  who followed him east on 52 but was waiting for another officer to join him for  a traffic stop.  </P> <P> Fischer apparently saw that he was being followed and pulled onto the highway  median to pass slower traffic in front of him, Newsome said. Fischer hit the  center guardrail and pulled back into the fast lane, sideswiping a car, which  in turn was pushed into another car, he said.  </P> <P> All three vehicles spun out. Fischer received moderate injuries, and the driver  and two occupants of the third car received lesser injuries. All four were  taken to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, where Fischer was arrested on  suspicion of driving a stolen vehicle and of evading arrest.  </P></p>

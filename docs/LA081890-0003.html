			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> VIRGINIA;  </P> <P> GOVERNOR PLANS CUTS IN LOCAL AID  </P> <P> Gov. L. Douglas Wilder said he plans to cut $333 million in local aid to help  balance the state budget, and those reductions will hurt school budgets.  </P> <P> Speaking to state Senate committees in Richmond, Va., Wilder detailed his plans  to deal with a projected $1.4-billion deficit in the state's $26-billion  1990-92 biennial budget. Wilder's budget director, Karen Washabau, said other  cuts the governor has proposed in state agency spending could cause 400 to  1,500 layoffs. But she said those figures were tentative until the governor  decides on Sept. 14 what specific cuts he will order.  </P></p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Jingsheng makes first public appearance since imprisonment in 1979 MR WEI Jingsheng, China's most celebrated dissident, has been shown on Hong Kong television - the first time he has appeared publicly since his imprisonment in 1979, Tony Walker writes. The 'unveiling' of Mr Wei, who is still serving a 15-year jail term, suggests that the authorities may be preparing the ground for his release. His appearance also seems aimed at answering international criticism of China's human rights record. China is sensitive to continuing criticism in the US Congress, accompanied by threats that it may deny Beijing renewal of its Most Favoured Nation status, vital to its continued access to the huge American market. Beijing, which is bidding to stage the 2,000 Olympiad, is also thought to want to forestall suggestions by human rights groups that its continued detention of dissidents should disqualify it from securing the Olympics. Mr Wei, an electrician, was accused of passing military secrets to foreigners, and also of being one of the ringleaders of the democracy movement in the late 1970s. The long-serving dissident had never admitted his guilt.</p>

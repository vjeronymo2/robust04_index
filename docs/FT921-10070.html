			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Cheques Bill passed by MPs A BILL designed to combat cheque fraud completed its passage through the Commons yesterday. The Cheques Bill seeks to impose a legal requirement on banks to ensure that cheques crossed 'account payee', either with or without the word 'only', are not transferred to any other account. The private member's bill was introduced by Mr Conal Gregory, Conservative MP for York, and had all-party support. It gives effect to representations made by the Banking Ombudsman and the Consumers' Association. The bill, which now goes to the House of Lords, would also impose a liability on banks if they accept cheques bearing fraudulent endorsements.</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazilian move lifts coffee Coffee prices staged a partial recovery after Wednesday's sharp fall and moved up Dollars 11 a tonne yesterday to Dollars 1,180 a tonne. The market was buoyed by Brazil's announcement that it would rollover producers' debt, for which it is holding coffee as collateral. That means Brasilia will be able to hold on to the coffee rather than selling it in the open market. In fact, Brazil will enter the market again today when it stages its latest coffee auction. Reports that the uprising in Mexico could affect the coffee crop also underpinned prices. Some estimates have put the loss to national production from rebel action as high as 20 per cent. Colombia's decision to cut its export target by 1m bags to 11m bags because the harvest was turning out to be poorer than expected had already given support to the weak coffee market. Coffee producers will meet in Guatemala today to review the retention scheme which came into operation in October. Although coffee prices have not risen much since the scheme came into operation, producers' actions have helped to support prices at their current level.</p>

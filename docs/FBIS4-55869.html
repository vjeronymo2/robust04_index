			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1000 GMT on 20 May within its  regular 16-minute newscast carries several reports on the  situation in the republic.    Kemal Halilhodzic reports that "the past 24 hours have been  extremely difficult for Bugojno and parts of the free Donji  Vakuf territory. The approximately 60 destructive long-range  shells that the chetniks launched from the surrounding hills on  the populated regions from the direction of Kupres and Donji  Vakuf killed four people and seriously or lightly wounded 10,  including four children.    Smail Terzic reports that "in the region covered by the 7th  South Operations Group, the village of Sije has been exposed to  the fiercest attacks. During almost all of last night, the  aggressor shelled this village and the defense lines with mortar  bombs. The material damage is huge." Further on in the report,  Terzic says that "the enemy is attacking these free territories  with all available weapons and artillery pieces in order to  reach the Doboj-Teslic road. However, the defense lines are  increasingly firmer and more stable by the day"    A report by the 4th Corps Information Service says that  "last  night and the early morning hours in the zone covered by the 4th  Corps were somewhat calmer than during the previous day,  although on several occasions, the chetniks fired all kinds of  artillery pieces, with the barrels directed at [names  indistinct]. Some provocative activity has been registered on  the Mostar battlefield as well. A calmer start to the day, with  only occasional aggressor's fire from antiaircraft weapons on  the Konjic battlefield in the region of (Djelomici) and  (Glasicevo), does not mean that the chetniks have given up the  shelling of residential districts in the zone covered by the 4th  Corps. These areas have been shelled almost incessantly lately;  artillery assaults are being launched suddenly, therefore the  general danger alarm is still in force in Konjic.    "Along the lines of separation between the Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croatian Defense Council [HVO], there  have been no incidents during last night and this morning,  unlike the previous day when, on several occasions, HVO  extremist snipers fired on our fighters' lines on the Mostar  battlefield. Frequent explosions coming from the Dubravska  Plateau have also been registered and it seems that HVO  extremists have been blowing up the remaining Bosniak houses,  which means that there are still some hotheads in the HVO ranks  who oppose the signed agreements."    Studio Announcer Aleksandra Hafeti reads report of the  Gorazde Press Center that "the protected zone of Gorazde has  still been exposed to aggressor's attacks with shells and  anti-aircraft weapons."</p>

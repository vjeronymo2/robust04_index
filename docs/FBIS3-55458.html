In an interview with the leftist TIESA newspaper, Gylys said  the reaction of the two Baltic neighbors was slightly different  because Estonia is more reserved about Lithuania's step.  Apparently, the Lithuanian minister gave the interview before  Estonian President Lennart Meri's view on the matter was made  public.    Gylys said "although we maintained close relations with  NATO,  our desire was unexpected to many."    The minister said Lithuania's request for NATO membership is  based on national security interests and is not directed against  anybody. "We move toward an era of politics without  confrontation."    In Gylys opinion, rapprochement with the alliance is an  evolutionary process, while Lithuania's move might only speed it  up. "This depends not only on Lithuania."</p>

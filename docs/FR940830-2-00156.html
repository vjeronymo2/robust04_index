			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. TAMCO and the Adviser are wholly-owned subsidiaries of The TCW Group, Inc. TAMCO serves as the sole general partner and administrator of the Partnership. TAMCO also manages the Partnership's investments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The Company, a Maryland corporation, is a registered open-end investment company formed as a series company. Currently, the Company offers ten portfolios. The Company proposes to offer a new investment portfolio (the ``Fund''), whose investment objectives and policies will be substantially similar to those of the Partnership. The Company has entered into an advisory agreement with the Adviser who will provide investment management services to the Fund that are substantially the same as the services that TAMCO currently provides to the Partnership.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Applicants propose that, pursuant to an agreement and plan of exchange, the Fund acquire substantially all of the assets and assume substantially all of the liabilities of the Partnership in exchange for Fund shares (the ``Exchange''). Prior to the Exchange, information and a prospectus will be delivered to the Partnership's limited partners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Fund shares received by the Partnership will have an aggregate net asset value equivalent to the net asset value of the assets transferred by the Partnership (except for the effect of organizational expenses paid by the Fund). Upon consummation of an Exchange, the Partnership will distribute the Fund shares to its partners, with each partner receiving shares having an aggregate net asset value equivalent to the net asset value of the Units held by such partner prior to the Exchange (except for the effect of organizational expenses paid by the Fund). The Partnership may retain assets needed to pay any accrued expenses. The Partnership also may retain assets that the Fund is not permitted to purchase, or that would be unsuitable for the Fund. Assets retained by the Partnership that are not needed to pay accrued expenses will be distributed  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to the partners of the Partnership. The Partnership will be liquidated and dissolved following the distribution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The agreement governing the Partnership provides that the Partnership may be converted into a registered investment company if the general partner determines that a conversion is in the best interest of the Partnership. The agreement expressly provides that no further approval or consent of the limited partners is required for such conversion, so long as at least 60 days' advance written notice is provided to the limited partners. Limited partners who do not wish to participate in the conversation of the Partnership will have adequate opportunity to redeem their Partnership interests before the conversion occurs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The expenses of the Exchange will be borne by TAMCO. No brokerage commission, fee, or other remuneration will be paid in connection with the Exchange. Fund organizational expenses, up to a maximum of $50,000, will be paid by the Fund and amortized over five years. Fund organizational expenses in excess of $50,000 will be paid by the Adviser. Any unamortized organizational expenses associated with the organization of a Fund at the time the Adviser withdraws its initial investment in the Company will be borne by the Adviser and not the Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

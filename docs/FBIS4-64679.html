			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Johan Cuppens commentary: "Lost Honor of the European </F> Parliament"]    [Text] The enlargement of the European Union (EU) to  include four new member states has come one step closer. For  yesterday, the European Parliament (EP) gave its approval to the  accession treaties that had previously been concluded with  Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Austria.    The voting was preceded by an unprecedented lobbying  campaign, with all parties mobilizing their members in an effort  to achieve the required majority. Great effort was invested in  the lobbying campaign, and EP members (MEPs) were put under  pressure from various quarters by means of letters bearing the  signatures of figures ranging from Jean-Luc Dehaene, German  Chancellor Kohl, and the outgoing Netherlands Prime Minister  Ruud Lubbers to [Luxembourg] Prime Minister Jacques Santer.    In each case the message was unequivocal: The EU cannot  leave the four applicant countries at a loose end and must "send  a signal" by means of a positive vote that the newcomers are  welcome.    There is no objection to this attitude. After all, the EU is  an "open" association of states that any democratic country  subscribing to its goals can join. Nobody wants to prevent  enlargement of the club. However, enlargement of this kind does  become a problem if other conditions are not fulfilled first.  That is precisely where the shoe pinches, and at that level the  EP vote can hardly have been welcomed by those who have serious  intentions regarding a politically unified Europe.    There are a great many good arguments in favor of  enlargement  that have to be taken into account. The candidate member states  can all pride themselves on their highly democratic institutions  and on the fact that these institutions function exceptionally  well. Moreover, the countries in question share the same culture  as the 12 existing EU member states. The latter argument can  also be used for including the countries of Central and Eastern  Europe.    And yet, by deciding as it did, the EP was not true to  itself  and did not do Europe a good turn. For the Europe that is about  to be launched is quite a different Europe than the one for  which committed Europeans are striving, namely a unified Europe,  showing solidarity, and a Europe with smoothly functioning  institutions.    Under pressure from pure political considerations, the  negotiations on accession were hurried through without at the  same time keeping an eye on the need to adjust the rules of play  with a view to securing the internal EU functioning.    That is precisely where the EP went wrong. In the past,  Parliament has come out with numerous resolutions and issued  urgent calls to begin by deepening the Union and only then  proceeding to enlarge it. But when it came to turning words  into deeds, the EP cried off.    Grim statements, such as voting "with a very heavy heart" in  favor of enlargement, or "in order to serve higher interests,"  or "in order to show solidarity with the candidate member  states" all have a false ring about them. Not only do they  contradict previous, frequently idealistic outpourings, but in  many instances they also conceal pure opportunism on the part of  MEPs who are seeking to save their political hide.    So, shortly before the European elections (scheduled for 12  June), Parliament has missed a unique opportunity. Its  credibility may well have been dealt a fatal blow. The EP has  lost its honor.</p>

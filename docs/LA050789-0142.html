			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TIMES SHOPPER: CARRYING ON ABOUT LUGGAGE AND OTHER GADGETS  </P> <P> Successful shopping sprees can be greatly aided by practical preparation in the  form of sturdy, efficient luggage.  </P> <P> Luggage manufacturers offer hard-sided (more protective, but heavier) or  soft-sided (more stuffable) cases in a great many sizes and shapes, in plain  colors or patterns, with a variety of pockets and special features, and with or  without wheels (either built-in or removable).  </P> <P> Choosing isn't easy.  </P> <P> However, interviews with a random sampling of luggage retailers nationwide,  found that two manufacturers, Tumi and Andiamo, were consistently mentioned.  Both manufacturers are known for their durable and functional products. Tumi's  style is conservative and businesslike. Andiamo is more sporty. Both use  super-rugged nylon, offer long-term guarantees and are similarly priced.  </P> <P> Tumi's line includes carryalls and carry-ons, as well as large and small  suitcases with optional wheels.  </P> <P> Available in cowhide (black or brown) or 1050 Denier Ballistic nylon (black,  navy or sage), Tumi luggage is popular with business travelers who carry  five-suit ($525 in leather, $335 in nylon) or tri-fold garment bags ($475 in  leather, $295 in nylon), both with convenient U-shaped pockets, plus  overnighter/briefcases ($295 in leather, $195 in nylon).  </P> <P> Acquisitive travelers should put the packed garment bag into an empty suitcase,  then carry purchases home in the suitcase. Or use a small suitcase inside a  larger one. Nylon suitcases (with strong and collapsible poplar wood frames) in  24-inch ($250), 27-inch ($275) or 30-inch ($295) lengths are best bets.  </P> <P> When full, 32-inch cases ($315) may exceed airline weight limits; 21-inch  ($225) cases are as small as carry-ons. Tumi's sturdy zippers are designed to  avoid stress; wheels ($20 per set) are optional.  </P> <P> Tumi is sold in Los Angeles at H. Savinar (4625 W. Washington Blvd.; discounted  prices on Tumi and other brands) and By Design (at the Beverly Center in West  Hollywood). For brochures and/or other retailers, call toll-free (800)  322-TUMI.  </P> <P> Tutto, neither as well known nor as widely distributed, makes distinctive  luggage that conveniently functions as both a suitcase and a luggage cart.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stable Enough to Stack  </P> <P> Tutto's attractive high-tech, square-shaped bags are made of durable vinyl that  has been securely attached to lightweight metal frames on balanced castor  wheels. The sturdy cases are stable enough to stack (or carry additional  luggage, piggyback-style). They also can be wheeled about with U-shaped metal  handles.  </P> <P> Available in 28-inch ($130), 26-inch ($115) and 20-inch ($90) sizes in black,  gray, navy or gray-gold, the cases collapse to a width of 2 1/2 inches for easy  storage or packing inside each other.  </P> <P> Tutto cases, which have a five-year guarantee, are sold at H. Savinar,  Industrial Revolution (7560 Melrose Ave.), Fred Segal in Santa Monica (500  Broadway) or through the American Airlines catalogue. For more retailers, call  (415) 873-0254.  </P> <P> Several luggage carts are recommended. A handsome high-tech collapsible model  made of black anodized aluminum and gold-colored polyamide plastic, weighing 2  pounds and able to carry up to 66 pounds, is featured in the New York Museum of  Modern Art's catalogue for $90. Call (800) 447-6662.  </P> <P> Brookstone, of Peterborough, N.H., offers a big-wheeled aluminum dolly ($55)  with an optional case ($19) that carries up to 200 pounds. Call (603) 924-9541.  </P> <P> The flight attendant's luggage trolley from Hammacher-Schlemmer ($89.95)  carries up to 175 pounds and has retractable rear wheels for extra support. The  store is at 309 N. Rodeo Drive, Beverly Hills, or call (800) 543-3366.  </P> <P> If luggage pops open, extra bindings can prevent loss. Construct bindings by  buckling together several old belts, or order strong nylon straps (72 inches  long with buckles, in black or blue) from Le Travel Store (295 Horton Plaza,  San Diego, (800) 854-6677) for $4.25 (other stores charge $10 and up).  </P> <P> In addition to sets of small plastic bottles and kits for manicures/sewing,  other invaluable packing accessories include Brookstone's see-through vinyl  cases ($10 to $14) and special shoe suitcases (which can hold up to eight pairs  of shoes, for $55) and Le Travel Store's see-through net ditty bags ($4 to $5),  multipocket garment-bag organizers ($15 to $19) and shoe sacks (two pairs for  $5.95).  </P> <P> </P> <P> Zippered Portfolio  </P> <P> For organizing travel documents, credit cards, checks, currency and receipts,  Yamani's sleek 23-pocket zippered portfolio of soft leather is available from  The Sharper Image, (800) 344-4444, for $119.  </P> <P> Although it's advisable to travel with few encumbrances and as light as  possible, several gadgets are well worth their weight in comfort and security.  Inflatable pillows fit around the neck to allow for comfortable dozing and to  prevent stiffness on plane or train rides. Available from Brookstone ($9.50)  and Le Travel Store (adult and children's sizes, $9.95).  </P> <P> For safeguarding valuables and travel documents, Le Travel Store has waterproof  cases to be worn around the neck ($9.75) or waist ($10), or looped over a belt  and tucked inside trousers ($8, or $18.50 for a leather version from  Brookstone).  </P> <P> Le Travel Store's secret-pocket belt is in twill ($20), Brookstone's is leather  ($27.50). Traveler's Checklist (335 Cornwall Bridge Road), Sharon, Conn. 06069,  (203) 364-0144) offers lock and bolt devices that secure drawers or doors  ($11.50), while Brookstone sells small combination safes ($35) that clamp on  door knobs, and portable alarms ($37.50) that sound when someone touches the  doorknob to which they're connected.  </P> <P> For personal safety, the Traveler's Instant Fire Escape ($395, exclusively at  Hammacher-Schlemmer) features 130 feet of stainless-steel cable (weighing 8 1/2  pounds) that enables an adult (with child) to exit a burning high-rise hotel  when other means of escape are not available.  </P> <P> Health-related products include the Salt-Chek Sodium Sensor ($35, Sharper  Image), a small, probe-like device that measures salt content in airplane or  restaurant food, and the Brita Travel Water Filter (about $10 at The Broadway,  Robinson's and health-food stores, or call (800) 537-2823). The latter is said  to remove up to 90% of the chlorine, copper and lead from tap water and prevent  the growth of bacteria in water that has been filtered.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Converting Currencies  </P> <P> Pocket-size computers instantly convert foreign currencies into dollar amounts  ($15, Le Travel Store) or translate frequently used words into five languages  (English, French, Spanish, Italian and German; $79 from Sharper Image or $84.50  from Hammacher-Schlemmer).  </P> <P> The Talking Alarm Clock ($124.75, Hammacher-Schlemmer) announces the time in 20  cities in 24 time zones and has a readout with time and date at your present  location.  </P> <P> Hammacher-Schlemmer boasts the world's smallest camera, the Minox EC ($301).  Measuring 1 3/16 inches by 3/8 inch, it weighs only .15 ounce and fits into  your palm.  </P> <P> Prices listed above do not include shipping charges on mail-ordered items.  </P></p>

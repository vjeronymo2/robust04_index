			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / World News in Brief: Canary Wharf cleared as police disable bomb Police evacuated the Canary Wharf area of east London last night before disabling a large explosive device found in a Ford Transit van parked under a Docklands light railway station about 20 yards from the offices of The Daily Telegraph. Two men in the van were challenged by security guards, but threatened them with a gun and drove off in a car which was later found abandoned. The Telegraph lost a large part of its print run.</p>

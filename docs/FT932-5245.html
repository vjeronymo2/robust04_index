			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: Saga tops estimates for first four months SAGA PETROLEUM, Norway's biggest independent oil company, yesterday reported a sharp rise in pre-tax profits in the first four months of this year to NKr640m (Dollars 61m) from NKr269m, helped by higher crude oil prices and increased production. The result was better than analysts' forecasts and Saga shares improved. Revenues rose to NKr2.08bn from NKr1.64bn. Operating profit increased to NKr658m from NKr378m and net profits more than doubled to NKr209m. Saga obtained an average sales price of NKr128 per barrel of oil in the four months, against NKr115. Oil sales rose to 10m barrels from 8.3m. Total production of oil, gas and natural gas liquids increased to 1.7m tonnes of oil equivalent, from 1.4m. Saga said the improved result was also helped by the reversal of a NKr119m unrealised currency loss, in connection with the group's long-term dollar loans. Net financial expenses were reduced to NKr18m from NKr109m.</p>

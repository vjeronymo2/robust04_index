			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Mexican private sector has guaranteed that the  violent events that led to the death of Luis Donaldo Colosio  will not change the economic course of the nation nor will they  provoke flight of capital or depreciation of the peso. The  reason for this is because Mexico has solid instruments for  confronting possible alterations in the financial markets.    [Begin unidentified entrepreneur recording] We feel that we  have a solid project, particularly if we all defend it. [end  recording]    The entrepreneur pointed out that an emergency plan is not  needed, nor any additional measures other than the ones agreed  upon in the current agreement. Nonetheless, he warned that we  must be very cautious and not allow strange forces to manipulate  us and alter the economic and political program or even lead to  destabilization.    [Begin Antonio Sanchez Diaz de Rivera, president of Mexican  Employers Confederation, recording] Some are trying to attain  that destabilization. Nonetheless, if all sectors are united  and there is social unity, and if authorities and society act  jointly to prevent it, we will definitely prevent it. [end  recording]    In matters of politics, the businessmen pointed out that  although the death of the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary  Party] presidential candidate will somewhat tarnish the  electoral process, they ruled out the possibility that the  elections be postponed beyond 21 August.    [Begin Ricardo Dajer Nahum, president of Confederation of  National Chambers of Commerce, recording] I think the elections  must be held on 21 August. I feel we cannot allow the  objectives of those who have provoked a series of events -- that  we denounced in a certain way last week -- to be attained. [end  recording]    As for the financial markets that remain closed on Thursday  as a sign of mourning, Manuel Robleda, leader of the Mexican  Stock Market, urged investors to be prudent, as it was observed  in the foreign market that Mexican Government debt titles  registered a moderate drop.    Throughout the financial institutions, the polled  businessmen  said they were determined to continue working for the benefit of  the economic project.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified businessman] The economy  must  remain at the same level it is now. It must maintain the same  standards of living we have and continue working as usual.    [Second unidentified businessman] There will not be any  movements that will change our country's way of living. [end  recording]</p>

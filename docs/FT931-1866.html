			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Volvo bus plant opens in Ayrshire VOLVO, THE Swedish car and commercial vehicle maker, yesterday started production at its Pounds 6.5m bus chassis assembly plant at Irvine, Ayrshire. The operation, which runs alongside Volvo's existing truck assembly plant at Irvine, has a capacity to build 1,500 bus chassis a year. The start of production marks the completion of Volvo's rationalisation of its bus operations in the UK. These have been drastically reduced since Volvo's Pounds 24m takeover of Leyland Bus in 1988. Mr Bjorn Larsson, president of Volvo Bus, said the UK bus operations had cost Volvo nearly Pounds 100m - which includes the acquisition price and five years of losses. As part of the restructuring, Volvo has transferred all bus chassis assembly to Irvine from the former Leyland Bus plant at Workington, Cumbria, This will close by the end of June with the loss of more than 100 jobs. Volvo had previously closed bus production at the Farington, Lancashire bus plant. Mr Larsson said that the 'depressed' state of the UK market meant it had been 'absolutely essential' to close the Workington plant to reduce the company's break-even point. Leyland Bus, which once dominated the UK industry and employed 5,000 people in the early 1980s, had a workforce of 1,850, when it was taken over by Volvo five years ago. All that remains is a components operation, Farington Components, near Leyland in Lancashire, which is still a subsidiary of Volvo Trucks (Great Britain), and has a workforce of 360. Volvo ended all production of bus bodies in the UK last year. With the transfer of chassis production to Irvine it is giving up the Leyland Bus brand name. Volvo said the transfer of production had created 70 new jobs in the Irvine bus assembly operations with the prospect of a further 80 'as markets recover, demand increases and plant output moves towards its 1,500 units a year capacity'. Volvo assembled 2,309 trucks at Irvine last year with a workforce of 300. On the new bus line it is planning to build chassis for the Olympian double-deck bus and the B6 single-deck midi bus. Output of the heavy-duty B10M single-deck bus/coach chassis is planned to start in 1994. Irvine will be the sole assembly centre in the Volvo group worldwide for the Olympian and B6 bus chassis. The introduction of the B6 midi bus marks Volvo's entry into this segment of the bus market, which has grown rapidly in significance in the UK as bus operators have moved to smaller buses under the impact of recession and the deregulation and privatisation of passenger transport. Volvo's Workington bus production fell last year to 458 from 593 a year earlier. Mr Larsson, said the Irvine plant had an order book for 325 Olympian double-deck buses, including a contract for 50 received last week from Hong Kong. Production of nearly 300 midi buses was planned for this year, he added. Volvo Bus worldwide recorded an operating profit last year of SKr89m (Pounds 7.8m) after a 1991 operating loss of SKr152m, said Mr Larsson. Volvo deliveries of bus chassis worldwide jumped by 20 per cent last year to 5,582 from 4,650 in 1991, with more than 60 per cent going to markets outside Europe. Its five key markets last year were Brazil, the UK, Iran, Uruguay and Sweden.</p>

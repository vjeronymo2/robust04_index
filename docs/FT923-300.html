			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DEALERS in the derivatives reported a dull session as the weekend worries over the outlook for the UK economy continued yesterday, writes Joel Kibazo. Bear closing early in the session saw the December contract on the FT-SE advance from its starting position of 2,638 to 2,643 within the first hour of business. The worries over the economy along with the profits downgrade in ICI by its joint broker sent a chill around the market and December fell back to 2,619 at around 10am. For the next few hours, December traded in a range of 2,620 to 2,635 before the weakness in other European markets and another bout of selling over the lunch time period caused it to fall to 2,615, the low point of the day. December remained volatile during the afternoon and closed at 2,621, down 29 on Friday's close and around 20 points above its fair value premium to cash of about 40. Turnover was poor reaching only 7,364 lots. In the traded options, total turnover was just 20,382 contracts, of which a mere 7,483 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option. Barclays bank was the most actively dealt stock option with a day's total of 1,334 trades.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Arts: A pretty little Prom After the television broadcast of the opening night of this year's Proms there were complaints from viewers. Not about the music, or the standard of performance. They were upset that the singers that night were not very attractive in close-up, which seems to confirm a trend in how the public regards classical musicians. It is no longer enough to play or sing well. For popular esteem, of the kind that suits the mass media, the performer has to look good too. As though the BBC had anticipated the audience's reaction, it chose its second Prom for television relay cannily. The Finnish soprano Karita Mattila, statuesque, elegantly attired, is unlikely to have prompted anything but letters of appreciation from those who look first and listen later. In the hall we could appreciate the glamour of her voice as well. She sang four not very substantial Grieg songs, a nod in recognition of the composer's 150th anniversary. All were well-known pieces, such as the Solveig solos from Peer Gynt, sung with rather more winning simplicity by Barbara Bonney in her Grieg recitals with piano. Mattila's strength was the warmth and substance of her voice, which projected strongly over the orchestral accompaniments. The conductor, Alexander Lazarev, seemed keen to let her be heard. Unfortunately, that was the only cause for rejoicing on the orchestral side. The concert had opened with a dismal performance of Stravinsky's Petrushka - no brilliance in the colours, no snap to the rhythms. Perhaps dancers at the Bolshoy (Lazarev's artistic home) prefer the music at this speed, whereas orchestras in the West are used to spinning through it on tip-toe, as it were. The BBC Symphony Orchestra stumbled on many ragged corners. (The student orchestra that I heard at the Schleswig-Holstein Festival a couple of weeks ago played the music with more purpose.) A little more energy informed Tchaikovsky's Suite No 3, but not so much as to be positively exciting. It is disappointing that the improvements at the BBCSO achieved under Andrew Davis do not necessarily carry through when there is somebody else on the podium.</p>

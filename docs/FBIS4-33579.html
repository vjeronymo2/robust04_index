			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 7 Jun (NA) -- Daniel Brunella,  president of the Chamber of Exporters, today admitted his  concern over the fact that during the first 4 months of the year  exports grew by only 4 percent, and demanded "very urgent and  concrete" measures to achieve a significant increase in sales  abroad.    The businessman believes that an increase in imports cannot  be avoided because they are caused by the overall growth of the  economy, but he considers that it is necessary to adopt measures  so that the government "can achieve the highly touted objective  of increasing exports."    The trade deficit amounted to $2.404 billion during the  first  4 months of the year, 378 percent greater than in the same  period in 1993.    Brunella maintained that financing exports, and granting  loans with an interest rate equal to that in competitor  countries, are the problems that have to be resolved.    Finally, the businessman indicated that "the labor laws must  be modified to create new job sources and achieve once and for  all an efficient system of temporary admission."</p>

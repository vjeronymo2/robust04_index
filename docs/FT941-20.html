			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Politics knock sterling The renewed political difficulties of Mr John Major, who faces widespread criticism from within his own party, put the pound under pressure on foreign exchanges yesterday, writes Philip Gawith. Sterling got off to a very nervous start following intense media speculation about Mr Major's future, following what was seen as a humiliating climbdown over voting rights in the European Union. In early European trading sterling fell below Dollars 1.4750, from Tuesday's London close of Dollars 1.4927, before steadying to finish at Dollars 1.4790. It was also lower against the D-Mark, closing at DM2.4829 from DM2.4889. Short sterling futures also took a battering, the June contract falling 14 points to a low of 94.42 before rallying to end at 94.52. Trading was generally fairly quiet, investors either taking to the sidelines or scaling back their positions ahead of the long weekend. The tidying up of positions at the end of the quarter also played a part. There were few surprises in Germany, where the Bundesbank allowed the repo rate to fall by another four basis points to 5.76 per cent. The Belgian central bank brought itself into line with lower German rates by cutting its key central rate 10 basis points to 6.05 per cent. Aside from political worries, sterling was also undermined by talk of a tightening in credit policy which accompanied the monthly monetary meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. Many UK analysts believe inflation pressures remain subdued and are counting on a further base rate reduction, probably in the summer. The chances of a cut will have improved with the Bundesbank yesterday confirming the downward path of German rates. The market, however, continues to take a gloomier view of events. The June short sterling future is discounting a rise in base rates of about 25 basis points to 5.5 per cent by mid-year. Futures staged a recovery in the afternoon after plummeting during early trade. The December contract closed unchanged at 93.96 after a low for the day of 93.72. Mr Julian Callow, international economist at Kleinwort Benson, said the profile of short-term rates was very exaggerated. 'The market is basically factoring in a full-blown sterling crisis, a sharp pick-up in UK inflation and rapid economic growth, all at once.' He said it was unlikely that the UK would be hit by this combination. The Kleinwort analyst said sterling had been 'cruising for a bruising' ever since the controversial rate cut in February. The fundamental weakness of the currency had initially been disguised by the weaker dollar, but political concern and worries about the current account deficit had now resurfaced. Mr Callow said foreign investors were nervous about the political outlook, and sterling weakness reflected a more generalised shift out of UK assets. Some analysts argue that if Mr Major were to leave office, probably to be replaced by Mr Kenneth Clarke or Mr Michael Heseltine, this could well be positive for sterling. The Bank of England put Pounds 774m liquidity into the money markets after predicting a shortage of Pounds 750m. The D-Mark was softer in Europe after the Bundesbank again trimmed the repo rate. It closed lower in London against the French franc at FFr3.419 from FFr3.424. The Italian lira continued to firm in the aftermath of the election. It finished at L973.4 from L977.9. Analysts said the cut in the repo rate showed that the Bundesbank was prepared to continue cutting rates in spite of poor money supply figures. German M3 money supply for February grew at an annualised 17.6 per cent, far above the Bundesbank's growth target of 4 to 6 per cent, but slower than January's 21.2 per cent rise. German call money stayed tight at the 6.75 per cent Lombard rate, with banks under pressure to ensure that they have secured sufficient month-end funds. Sentiment in the futures market was more positive, with the June Euromark contract a point firmer at 94.52 and the December contract six basis points higher at 94.91. The dollar finished higher against the weaker D-Mark, at DM1.6788 from DM1.6675. Against the yen, however, it was lower, ending in London at Y103.490 from Y103.600. In New York it closed at DM1.6748 and Y102.835. With the US-Japan trade row having returned to centre stage, Mr Steve Hannah, director of research at IBJ International, said it looked as if the yen would make another run at the all-time high of Y101.3 to the dollar. The US administration on Tuesday dismissed a Japanese market-opening package as 'of little substance'. Mr Hannah said it was clear 'this dispute is going to smoulder on for some time'. Traders said the recent volatility in the yen reflected end-of-quarter balance sheet manipulation by Japanese companies, and speculators probing to see at what levels the Bank of Japan was prepared to intervene to support the dollar.</p>

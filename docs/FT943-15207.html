			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Working Life: Condon on the money - Reading Matter Richard Condon was a late starter in the literary stakes, into middle age before he began writing. Now he's approaching 80, with 26 novels under his belt, and to judge from the new one, Prizzi's Money (Michael Joseph Pounds 14.99, 241pp) he's still going strong. This is the fourth in his series about the New York Mafia; the film of Prizzi's Honour established his wider fame and, I hope, his fortune, But connoisseurs of Condon would argue that the early books have never been bettered. The Manchurian Candidate, which became a very good film, may have been the best. A Talent for Loving - which ends with the Indians riding to the rescue of the hero from the US Cavalry - was probably the funniest. Sometimes the critics call Condon a satirist, sometimes a black comedian. The hallmark of all his fiction is the outrageous energy of his imagination, expressed in a prose which is baroque, even rococo, in its inventive extravagance. He is never happier, more confident, than when he is building an absurdly ornate cadenza of adjective, metaphor, paragraph. A Talent for Loving, for example, has page after page extolling the most exotic brands of cheese. And who can forget the wonderful scene in The Manchurian Candidate where Janet Leigh on a train journey talks down the Frank Sinatra character from a nervous breakdown? Prizzi's Money has Henry Asbury, 'adviser to presidents', a Croesus who has also been the Mafia's man in the White House for four administrations, arranging his own kidnapping for a Dollars 75m profit on the ransom. Thanks to his tricky wife Julia, it goes wrong, and Don Corrado Prizzi, aged 86 but still with a healthy appetite, surrounded by his usual team of endearing villains from the earlier books, is extremely cross. Julia is the central figure and no doubt Hollywood's actresses will die for the part: 'a tall woman, a statuesque grabber, with cheekbones as high as the heads on Mount Rushmore. Her glossy, blue-black hair was arranged flat against her head, like a flamenco dancer's, over large, dark, steady eyes like periaktos, those triangular revolving prisms used as scenery in the ancient Greek theater, eyes which seemed to mock the men in the huge room for somewhere taking the wrong turning.' Omerta clashes with infamita, international finance has rarely been described with less respect, and Condon's prose rises to its usual excesses. It is, of course, corn - the higher corn; clever, funny, forgettable.</p>

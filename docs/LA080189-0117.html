			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EX-PRISONERS CLEARED TO ENTER U.S.;  </P> <P> VIETNAMESE IN O.C. HAIL PACT ALLOWING EMIGRATION  </P> <P> An agreement that would free thousands of former Vietnamese prisoners to  emigrate to the United States was hailed in Orange County Monday as "a major  breakthrough," and one that could mean reunification of many families in the  largest Vietnamese community in the nation.  </P> <P> "Yes, this is good news because we have been waiting for so long," said Nhu Hao  T. Duong, executive director for the Community Resources Opportunity Project in  Santa Ana. "To us, this is a major breakthrough."  </P> <P> As a result of negotiations between the United States and Vietnam, the former  prisoners and their families -- as many as 100,000 Vietnamese, by initial State  Department accounts -- may be eligible for emigration. The first 3,000 are  expected to arrive in the United States by the end of the year, U.S. State  Department officials announced Monday.  </P> <P> No details were immediately available about where the Vietnamese immigrants  will be settled in the United States, but about 40% of all past refugees from  the Southeast Asian nation have chosen California, and the majority of those  moved to Orange County. Mostly centered in the cities of Westminster and Garden  Grove, the Orange County Vietnamese community numbers close to 100,000, its  leaders estimate.  </P> <P> But while Vietnamese community leaders in Orange County and some government  officials welcomed the news, other officials tempered their enthusiasm with  concern about the impact of a new wave of immigration on already-strained local  government budgets.  </P> <P> "This is not a Westminster problem, this is a federal government problem," said  Westminster Mayor Charles V. Smith regarding resettlement under the new  agreement. He added that he expects few new refugees to settle in his city  because housing is limited.  </P> <P> Monday's agreement was worked out in negotiations between Robert L. Funseth,  senior deputy secretary of state, and Vu Khoan, Vietnam's assistant minister of  foreign affairs, who met in Hanoi last week. In the joint announcement, they  said the program could begin as soon as October.  </P> <P> They said the talks were initiated "to resolve one of the issues of mutual  concern to the two countries." That issue involved the fate of former soldiers,  government officials and others who had been loyal to the U.S.-supported South  Vietnamese government in Saigon before it was overrun by North Vietnamese  forces in 1975.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) said the announcement of  the pact is "really good news" and is in keeping with the congressman's efforts  to give priority to the emigration of people kept in Vietnamese re-education  camps.  </P> <P> Dornan spokesman Brian Bennett also predicted that immigrants who choose to  come to Orange County will soon become productive residents.  </P> <P> "I think the Vietnamese community here will do as they have in the past --  provide houses and jobs and whatever else they need to get on their feet  themselves," Bennett said.  </P> <P> But Orange County Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, whose district includes portions  of Garden Grove and Westminster, said the county will need to look to the state  and federal governments to assist in funding public services for any new  Vietnamese immigrants. "Health care will be greatly affected," he said, unless  the county receives federal aid similar to that received in reaction to the  wave of immigration following the fall of Saigon.  </P> <P> Garden Grove Councilman Robert F. Dinsen said the immigrants could cause a new  round of adjustment problems in his city. "It will be a period of time until  they (new immigrants) adjust, and the Caucasians learn to live with them," he  said.  </P> <P> Orange County Vietnamese leaders acknowledged, too, that the immigrants will  need various special services to help them start new lives.  </P> <P> "The English (language) training, job training and mental health services --  all these things will be needed," said Duong, the director for the Vietnamese  community-resource project.  </P> <P> While hailing the agreement, the Vietnamese refugee leaders said they remain  suspicious that the Vietnamese government may be using the issue to seek  diplomatic relations with the United States.  </P> <P> "This is a good-will gesture for Vietnam, (but) in the eyes of the nation's  Vietnamese community, we think that Vietnam wants to establish relations with  the United States later," said Le Xuan Khoa, director of the Indochina Resource  Action Center in Washington.  </P> <P> But others, especially those with relatives in Vietnam, were pleased.  </P> <P> "It's good news for everybody," said Tien Nguyen of Costa Mesa, a former South  Vietnamese air force officer whose 56-year-old brother remains in a Vietnamese  re-education camp. "The key victory for us who are the activists in the  community is that we wanted the U.S. never to stop thinking about those people  in Vietnam who fought for freedom.  </P> <P> "Some of them have been put in jail for 10 years or longer," he said.  </P> <P> THEY'RE HAPPY, BUT -- Members of the Orange County Vietnamese community react  with caution.

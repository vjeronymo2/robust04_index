			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Abridged Statement by A.B. Vengerov, chairman of the Court </F> of Appeal for Information Disputes: "Court of Appeal for  Information Disputes Under the Russian Federation President  Ruling No. 15 `On the Violation of Legal and Ethical Norms in  ZAVTRA Articles,' dated 2 June 1994, Moscow"]    [Text] The Court of Appeal for Information Disputes under  the Russian Federation President, after examining the contents  of a ZAVTRA article entitled "World Roguery" (Nos. 15-16, 1994),  and having heard the expert conclusions of M.A. Melnikov and  S.A. Modestov, the statement by the Russian Federation Ministry  of Justice, the warning to the newspaper ZAVTRA from the Russian  Federation Committee for Printed Materials [Roskompechat], the  speech by S.P. Gryzunov, deputy chairman of the Russian  Federation Committee for Printed Materials, and explanations  from ZAVTRA's Deputy Chief Editor V.G. Bondarenko, has  established:    That the Court of Appeal has already issued a statement on  articles in ZAVTRA which violate legal and ethical norms,  particularly the item by I. Andronov entitled "Secrets of the  Kremlin" in which the chamber noted an abuse by the ZAVTRA  editorial team of the freedom of mass information, and a  violation of Paragraph 4 of the Russian Federation Law "On the  Mass Media." (See Court of Appeal Statement No. 1 of 4 April  1994, published in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, 13 April, 1994....)    ZAVTRA's editorial team ignored the Court of Appeal's  statement of 4 April 1994 and it continues the publication of  materials consituting a gross violation of legal and ethical  norms.    The interview with A. Zinovyev, carried under the heading  "World Roguery" (Nos. 15 and 16, 1994), contains direct calls  for unleashing war, the violent overthrow of constitutional  order, the inflamation of social and national intolerance and  hostility....    An analysis conducted by the Court of Appeal into the item  "World Roguery" concludes that ZAVTRA violated a number of legal  and ethical norms: "The Declaration of Human Rights and  Freedoms" (Article 4), the Russian Federaion Constitution  (Article 29), the Russian Federation Law "On the Mass Media"  (Article 4). The application for ZAVTRA's registration is at  notable variance with the actual content of many of the  newspaper's items.    Considering the aforestated, and guided by Articles 4, 9,  and  20 of the Statute on the Court of Appeal, the Court of Appeal  has decided:    1. To recognize that the article "World Roguery" published  in the newspaper ZAVTRA constitutes an abuse of the freedom of  mass information: It contains calls for the physical removal of  a number of state figures, advocates war, inflames social and  ethnic enmity, insults the Russian Federation president, and  denigrates and humiliates persons mentioned in the article,  which constitutes a gross violation of Article 4 of the Russian  Federation Law "On the Mass Media."    2. To take cognizance of the fact that the Russian  Federation Committee for Printed Matter has submitted an  official warning to ZAVTRA in respect of the article "World  Roguery," while the Russian Federation General Prosecutor's  Office has instigated criminal proceedings pertaining to  evidence of crimes which entail liability for calls for the  forcible alteration of the constitutional order and for the  propaganda of war.    3. To recommend that the Russian Federation Committee for  Printed Matter return to the question of adopting measures  provided for by law in respect of the article by I. Andronov  entitled "Secrets of the Kremlin" in the newspaper ZAVTRA (No.  11).    4. To propose that the Russian Federation Committee for  Printed Matter review the correlation between the application by  the newspaper's founder for its registration and the actual  content of the articles in line with Article 15 of the Russian  Federation Law "On the Mass Media."    [Signed] A.B. Vengerov, Chairman of the Court of Appeal.</p>

			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 12 GUARDS HURT AS INMATES REBEL OVER STAFF'S BLOCKADE OF N.Y. JAIL  </P> <P> Prisoners angered by a two-day guards' blockade of the city's giant Rikers  Island jail complex erupted in violence Tuesday night, injuring at least 12  guards and an undetermined number of inmates, officials said.  </P> <P> The disturbance occurred shortly before 6:30 p.m., just before a settlement was  announced in the blockade by the guards, who were protesting the earlier  beating of a guard by prisoners.  </P> <P> The job action had kept hundreds of prisoners from making court appearances and  thousands of workers from going home.  </P> <P> As word of the disturbance spread, many of the guards who had taken part in the  protest got into their cars and headed for the prison dormitory where it was  taking place.  </P> <P> A captain for the Correction Department, who spoke on the condition of  anonymity, said the inmates had clubs and knives.  </P> <P> "We had to gas them," he said. "They came at us with homemade knives. They had  broken up the bed frames. They were just fed up and they knew there weren't too  many of us, and that we were tired."  </P> <P> The injuries included tear gas inhalation, stab wounds and bumps and bruises.  </P> <P> When the settlement was announced, a spokesman for the Correction Captains  Assn., Joseph Dike, said the bridge leading to the island would be cleared as  soon as the agreement's details were on paper.  </P> <P> City officials met with union leaders to negotiate a peaceful end to the  blockade.  </P></p>

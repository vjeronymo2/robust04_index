			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OSCAR SNUB  </P> <P> "Talvisota (The Winter War)," Finland's entry for best foreign film, received  no Oscar nominations. I am in shock. How could the academy ignore a great  movie? The search for answers begins.  </P> <P> "Talvisota" portrays the 1939 Soviet invasion of Finland. The central character  is a simple farmer called to duty by the war. He is no Rambo or John Wayne. The  heroic aspect of the Finns' fierce defense of their country (outnumbered 50 to  1, little artillery support, no air force) is played down in the movie. The  tone throughout is grueling, gritty realism -- utterly devoid of jingoism or  heroics.  </P> <P> Perhaps this realism is what eliminated "Talvisota" from the running. Other  excellent films of 1989 slighted by Oscar also were realistic in style -- "Do  the Right Thing," "Drugstore Cowboy," "Roger &amp; Me."  </P> <P>  Perhaps a movie that portrays the Soviet Union as a vicious imperialist is  doomed in this era of glasnost and East-West rapprochement.  </P> <P> GREG OLSEN  </P> <P> La Crescenta  </P></p>

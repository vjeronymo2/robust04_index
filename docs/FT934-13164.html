			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Government Bonds: German base rate cuts trigger wave of easing THE Bundesbank took Europe's government bond markets by surprise with a half-point cut in key interest rates yesterday, triggering a wave of easing in the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy and Austria, while raising hopes of rate cuts in France, Denmark and possibly Spain. The main trend of the day was a shift out of long-dated bonds in Germany and France into short-dated paper, leading to a steepening of yield curves, as investors hoped to benefit from the easing in rates. In Germany, the bund futures contract fell on the rate cut announcement, then perked up again before falling back to close lower on the day. Having opened at 100.47, it reached a high of 100.57, and ended at 100.06. The cut in German interest rates led to speculation that inflation data due over the next few days will show an improvement and the next batch of money supply figures will show a fall. The shift towards short-dated paper was partly triggered by comments by Mr Tietmeyer, the president of the Bundesbank, that he sees little room for further a drop in long-term interest rates. HIGH-YIELDING European bond markets rallied on hopes of lower rates and yield spreads over the German 10-year bund narrowed to their lowest levels for Spain, Italy and Portugal. After the market closed, the Bank of Italy cut its discount rate by half a point. In Portugal, demand at the Treasury's auction of 10-year bonds was so strong that the auction size was increased from Es15bn to Es50bn. The average yield at the auction was 8.796 per cent. However, the market closed slightly lower on profit-taking. UK government bonds picked up on hopes of lower interest rates, with short and medium-dated gilts gaining about a quarter point. The gilt market largely ignored the release of disappointing trade figures yesterday morning - which showed that the non-EC trade gap increased last month to its highest level since February - and took its inspiration instead from the Bundesbank. The news from Germany reignited hopes of a cut in UK base rates, especially as sterling rose against the D-Mark, but economists warned that the Bank of England was unlikely to cut before the November 30 budget. The Liffe gilt future contract reached 115.20 but closed up 0.04 on the day at 115.07. Long-dated gilts closed little changed or slightly lower. JAPANESE government bonds tested new highs on hopes of lower money market rates, but traded down during the course of the session to close lower on the day. Short-dated cash bonds remained firm while futures and long-dated cash bonds headed lower, leading to a steepening of the yield curve. US Treasury bonds, led by the long end of the yield curve, suffered a big setback as the market reacted to fresh evidence that the US economy was picking up steam. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was down 1 7/16 to 104 5/8 , yielding 5.913 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was 1/16 lower at 100 1/32 , to yield 3.840 per cent. The market opened on a soft note, but the negative sentiment accelerated in response to the release of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's Business Outlook Survey, which showed economic activity in the region had surged over the past month. The reaction by traders indicated their concern over renewed inflationary pressures in the coming months. The decision to cut German interest rates did little to buoy the market. If anything, it served to raise fears that European central banks were set to stimulate their economies more aggressively.</p>

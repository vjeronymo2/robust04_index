			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRANDT WON'T TRAVEL TO IRAQ ALONE, GERMANY INDICATES  </P> <P> The German government said Friday that it is confident that other European  personalities will join former Chancellor Willy Brandt on his controversial  trip to Iraq next week.  </P> <P> "It is highly unlikely that Herr Brandt will travel alone," Foreign Ministry  spokesman Juergen Chrobog said.  </P> <P> The statement appeared to imply that former Italian Prime Minister Emilio  Colombo and former Belgian Finance Minister Willy de Clercq might join Brandt  on the trip to Baghdad, where Brandt is expected to seek release of European  hostages.  </P> <P> German Chancellor Helmut Kohl had asked the European Community president,  Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, to suggest to U.N. Secretary General  Javier Perez de Cuellar that Colombo and De Clercq travel to Iraq as special  envoys.  </P> <P> Perez de Cuellar, in talks with Brandt on Wednesday, wished the former  chancellor good luck but declined to name him as a U.N envoy. On Thursday,  Britain reacted angrily to the planned trip, saying that such visits must be  discouraged and that London was not consulted.  </P> <P> But German government spokesman Hans Klein said Friday that the trip is in  agreement with a European Community summit decision made last weekend in Rome  to discourage isolated visits to Baghdad.  </P> <P> "In its activities, the federal government strictly adheres to the Oct. 28  declaration of the European Council in Rome," Klein said.  </P></p>

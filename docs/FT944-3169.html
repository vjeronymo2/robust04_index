			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong moves ahead 1.8% on short-covering Tokyo continued to slide as investors, taking little encouragement from Monday's New York rebound and yesterday's gains in Hong Kong, stayed on the sell side, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average declined for the third straight day, losing 99.62 at 18,875.48 in volume estimated at 220m shares, up from Monday's 192.5m. The index moved within a narrow range, recording an early high of 19,017.10 and a low of 18,822.56. The Topix index of all first section stocks dipped 6.11 to 1,497.67, breaking 1,500 for the first time in about two weeks. Losers once again led winners, by 741 to 219, with 85 stocks making new lows for the year and 186 ending flat. The capital-weighted Nikkei 300 edged down 0.80 to 276.49, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 0.60 to 1,247.19. Arbitrage buying, encouraged by futures gains, took the market slightly higher in early trading but hedge sales by institutions undercut futures, and underlying stocks followed futures down, until buying by public fund managers and bargain hunters re-emerged late in the day. Japan Tobacco reflected the bearish tone, as it reached an intraday low of Y901,000 before picking up to finish at Y906,000, off Y14,000 and at its fourth new low in as many sessions. Other privatised stocks moved up. East Japan Railway put on Y2,000 at Y471,000 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone advanced Y3,000 to Y833,000. Odakyu Electric Railway gained Y7 at Y707 in the day's second highest volume of 3.2m shares. Steels were mixed: Kobe Steel, which on Monday announced plans to produce semi-finished steel products in Venezuela, added Y4 at Y300. Nippon Steel stayed at Y349 after 6.9m shares traded, the day's highest turnover. Kawasaki Steel dipped Y4 to Y393 and NKK firmed Y3 to Y265. Department store chain Yokohama Matsuzakaya revisited its 1994 high of Y600 before falling back to close at Y535, down Y10. On Monday, amid rumours that overseas Chinese and Korean funds had targeted the stock, it had climbed Y80, the maximum allowable in one day. Toymaker Bandai, which revealed plans to market a CD-ROM player based on Apple Computer's Pippin, a PowerPC-based multimedia platform, slipped Y10 to Y4,160. Other game industry players also lost ground. Nintendo shed Y140 to Y5,460 and Sega Industries Y90 to Y5,650. In Osaka, the OSE average ended 129.50 off at 20,757.69 in volume of 13.7m shares. Roundup The region searched for direction yesterday. HONG KONG bounced 1.8 per cent on short-covering after recent falls, the Hang Seng index rising 141.97 to 7,849.75. SG Warburg raised the market to neutral from underweight on a 12-month view, but remained underweight on a three-month basis, noting that it would remain sensitive to rising US interest rates. Jardine Matheson topped net gainers, rising HKDollars 1.75 or 3.2 per cent to HKDollars 55.75; HSBC added HKDollars 1.50 at HKDollars 81.75. Property and banking stocks made gains throughout the day on switching. Hang Seng Bank moved ahead HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 54.25, Swire Pacific 'A' HKDollars 1.10 to HKDollars 43.70 and Sun Hung Kai Properties 80 cents to HKDollars 46.50. The H-share index of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 17.46 or 1.8 per cent to 995.08. Chengdu Telecom H-shares dropped to HKDollars 2.425, on their debut, from an offer price of HKDollars 2.80 on fears about the Chinese economy. SEOUL fell 1.6 per cent amid worries that higher interest rates would prompt a liquidity squeeze. The composite index receded 16.89 to 1,025.89. Profit-taking pressured bank, construction and trading shares, which gained on Monday. The construction sub-index lost 1.6 per cent. Korea Mobile Telecom, however, improved Won2,500 to Won425,000, its first gain since November 29. KUALA LUMPUR staged a technical rebound, boosted by the overnight Wall Street rise and firmer regional markets, but brokers said the rally may be short-lived as funds are still waiting to sell. The composite index put on 4.64 at 900.41. Idris Hydraulic was actively traded, advancing 38 cents to MDollars 4.28 on bargain hunting. The newly listed Diethelm Holdings surged ahead to a high of MDollars 3.48 before closing at MDollars 3.16, against its initial public offer price of MDollars 1.80. TAIPEI fell away as some investors continued to be worried that local funds would sell shares to meet dividend payments. The weighted index declined 24.83 to 6,697.57 in turnover of TDollars 53bn. Financials failed to sustain an early rise driven by speculation that the inauguration of the ruling Nationalist party's candidate as a provincial governor on December 20 would boost prices. First Commercial Bank shed TDollars 1 to TDollars 189 after an intraday high of TDollars 193. SYDNEY was subdued, but with bargain hunting among leading industrials pushing the All Ordinaries index up 10.7 to 1,852.7, its high for the day. Leading mining stocks were mixed, with CRA up 14 cents at ADollars 17.20 but MIM a cent easier at ADollars 2.20 and WMC off 14 cents at ADollars 7.02. Banks were mixed overall: firmness among the leaders was seen as a cyclical move away from regional banks, due to their larger exposure to the corporate lending market where demand for funds is expected to hold firm over the next year or so. CBA rose 11 cents to ADollars 8.05 and Westpac by 10 cents to ADollars 4. BANGKOK finished higher in spite of profit-taking in the afternoon session  -which followed a strong morning rise on news that one of the opposition parties was to join the governing coalition. The SET index put on 27.08 at 1,305.58, off the day's high of 1,320.58, in turnover of Bt6.5bn. In the banking sector, Krung Thai Bank gained Bt4 at Bt79 and Bangkok Bank rose Bt6 to Bt186. Asia Equity upgraded its forecasts for 1994 earnings growth from 21.4 per cent to 29.7 per cent in this sector on the basis of its good performance over the previous nine months. BOMBAY retreated another 1.4 per cent in further response to the Congress party losses in key state polls, the BSE 30-share index finishing 54.43 lower at 3,830.05. Small investors were said to have been the main sellers, with mutual funds scaling down their divestment, compared with Monday.</p>

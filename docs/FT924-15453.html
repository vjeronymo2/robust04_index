			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / International Company News: STET acquires 83% of Finsiel STET, the telecommunications group controlled by IRI, the Italian state holding company, yesterday announced it was buying IRI's 83.3 per cent stake in Finsiel, the data processing group, for L700bn (Dollars 565.4m). The deal has been under consideration for some time and represents a major rationalisation of Italy's telecommunications and software industry. The move has been prompted by developments in the European telecommunications industry with telephone companies spreading into the fast expanding services sector. STET officials cited the recent case of France Telecom taking a stake in Cap Gemini. STET derives 74 per cent of its income from telecommunications services, 17 per cent from manufacturing and installation companies and 9 per cent from publishing and diversified activities It controls Italy's state owned telecommunications activities, notably SIP, the main operating utility and last year returned net profits of L1,413bn on sales of L22,946bn. Finsiel is the financial holding company co-ordinating IRI's software activities and turned in a net profit of L29.4bn on sales of L1,283bn. Last year Olivetti sought to carry out a reverse takeover of Finsiel but was turned down. Olivetti's overtures then accelerated the STET takeover. IRI is reducing its stake in STET to around 53 per cent of the ordinary shares and 1 per cent of savings stock. A definitive price tag for the deal will be fixed by November 30. Yesterday it was not clear what would happen to the remaining 16.7 per cent of Finsiel held by the Bank of Italy.</p>

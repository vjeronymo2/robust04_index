			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (31): Manufacturer integrates 13 European sites - Access to wider markets: Relational database allows faster response to customers DEVELOPING its business in Europe was the incentive for starch manufacturer Cerestar to find a database system. In 1985 it decided to integrate all 13 European sites, using a single hardware supplier and a single database, writes Claire Gooding. Cerestar was looking for complete systems for logistics, sales, purchasing, maintenance, and sales order processing, the latter having to deal with thousands of different grades of starch. The previous system had run on McDonnell Douglas equipment. Cerestar looked initially at hardware suppliers: Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and and Digital Equipment (DEC), and narrowed the choice of databases down to two: Cullinet's CA-DB (now owned by Computer Associates), and the SQL language on IBM. Cerestar went for the 'Vax cluster' solution - the most upgradeable and flexible hardware available before the spread of open systems, according to software development project leader David Burchill. The use of a fourth generation language (4GL) was one of the main reasons for the choice of CA: the product now known as CA-Build was available on DEC equipment at the time. The Pounds 1.5m contract covered all 13 sites, and included some initial training from Cullinet, later taken over in-house at Cerestar. There are now about 500 users at each of the sites: no-one has direct access through SQL, all use the applications developed by Cerestar's seven-strong development team. Mr Burchill is confident that the development of a fully-integrated database makes Cerestar more responsive, and has allowed the company to develop its business across Europe. 'We now sell to Germany,' he says. 'We couldn't have done that before.'</p>

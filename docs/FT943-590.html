			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries retreat as Fed leaves rates unchanged Longer-dated US Treasury bonds retreated yesterday afternoon after it became apparent that the Federal Reserve had decided against an immediate increase in short-term interest rates. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  9/16 lower at 96, with the yield rising to 7.841 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was off  1/32 at 99 17/32 , to yield 6.492 per cent. In the early hours, traders were reluctant to make fresh commitments as the Fed's Open Market Committee was meeting in Washington to discuss monetary policy. The waiting ended at 2pm when the central bank issued a terse announcement that the meeting had adjourned. There was no statement on policy, which led observers to conclude that the committee had opted to delay its next move to tighter credit conditions. Only a minority of analysts had expected a policy change yesterday. Most believed the Fed would wait until after the November elections, despite a recent spate of stronger than expected economic data. Still, prices on longer-data securities backtracked on the announcement, amid concerns that the Fed was falling behind in the race to keep ahead of inflation. Early on, the market was presented with data suggesting the contrary. The Conference Board said its index of consumer confidence had fallen this month to 88.4, against a reading of 90.4 in August. The index, which had been expected to show no change, encouraged the notion that inflation at the consumer level was still not a threat. However, the report was not enough to lift bond prices, with traders preoccupied with the possibility of impending policy decisions. Positioning ahead of an afternoon auction of Dollars 17.25bn in new two-year notes was also depressing the market during the morning. Dealers had hoped to wrest concessions from the Treasury when it awarded the securities. In the event, the bidding proved to be lacklustre and the notes were issued at a yield which slightly exceeded expectations. But with the Fed revealing its hand just a few minutes later, the event was quickly forgotten. Trading in European bond markets was very thin yesterday, with few investors prepared to commit themselves before knowing the impact on US interest rates of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting in the US. German government bonds shrugged off data showing that year-on-year inflation in the month to mid-September was 2.9 per cent, a fall from the previous month's figure of 3 per cent. 'The market is waiting on the FOMC and has completely ignored these good inflation figures,' said Mr Pio de Gregorio, European economist at NatWest Markets in London. The market will be watching today's Bundesbank council meeting for a change in interest rates, but Mr de Gregorio said that he did not think there would be a change in rates before the German election on October 16. The December bund future was around 89.01 in late trading, up 0.09 points on the day. The yield on 10-year Italian government bonds fell 7 basis points to 11.76 per cent yesterday. Mr Andre de Silva of PaineWebber said the optimism was prompted by hopes that trade union agreement on a cut in spending on pensions would allow the government to reduce its deficit. UK government bond trading languished in the shadow of the FOMC meeting and today's 10-year gilt auction. Mr Robert Thomas at NatWest Markets said he expected the auction to meet with good demand, but added that other gilts were being sold in order to buy the auction stock. He said: 'This is not new money coming into the market.' Mr Kevin Adams at BZW expected the auction to be covered between 1.5 and 2 times, but added that the switching out of other gilts may mean 'the after-market may be very heavy water'. This meant that if the Fed had increased rates, the market could gain in the morning, but trade off in the afternoon. The spread of gilts over bunds could widen to 165 basis points, he said, against 151 yesterday.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Samdech Chea Sim, acting head of state and chairman  of the National Assembly of the Kingdom of Cambodia, cordially  received His Excellency Georges Albert Wehry, ambassador of the  Netherlands to Cambodia, at the office of the Cambodian People's  Party this morning, 23 February.    Samdech Chea Sim sincerely thanked the Netherlands for  granting humanitarian aid to Cambodia in the agricultural,  health, and educational sectors and particularly for  contributing to the Cambodian people's quest for peace.  Concerning the Khmer Rouge [KR], he said that the royal  government has made many concessions to reunify the nation and  put an end to the war in Cambodia. However, because of their  belligerent nature, the Khmer Rouge have not shown any desire  for national reconciliation. They are bent on continuing the  massacre and plunder of the people in the remote regions.  Moreover, they have been using military forces against the  Khmer Royal Armed Forces [KRAF].    Samdech Chea Sim stressed that if the Khmer Rouge keeps  refusing to join the national reunification efforts, the royal  government will be obliged to use military force to stop their  savagery and protect the lives of the people. He also said that  recently our KRAF have conducted sweep operations and succeeded  in completely capturing the Anlung Veng camp from the Khmer  Rouge.    Samdech Chea Sim went on to say that His Majesty King  Norodom  Sihanouk will return to Cambodia in April to join his subjects  in celebrating the traditional Khmer New Year.    The Netherlands ambassador said he is delighted to visit  Cambodia and to find that Cambodia is reunified and has a new  legitimate government and parliament. The Netherlands  Government will help contribute to the rehabilitation of  Cambodia in the spirit of friendship and mutually beneficial  cooperation, he said before stresssing that the Netherlands also  sent its peacekeepers to Cambodia, but it is most regrettable  that these peacekeepers failed to disarm the Khmer Rouge. He  pledged that he would make every effort to continue on the good  bilateral cooperation between the Netherlands and Cambodia to  help promote Cambodia's agricultural, health, and educational  sectors.</p>

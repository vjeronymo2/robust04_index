			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY CENTER STANCE  </P> <P> Nancy Ray's article (Feb. 26) on the growth debate in Valley Center deserves  comment. The headline stating that "Newcomers Foil Plans to Fill Town's Core  With High-Density Housing" is patently untrue.  </P> <P> The statement that "slow-growth newcomers, who now make up a voting majority"  implies that old-time residents support development. Nothing could be further  from the truth. As a 15-year resident, I feel I can speak for the many people I  know who have lived here for many years and feel the same way I do. You would  be hard-pressed to find anyone who supports development in Valley Center except  those who stand to profit by it. The rest of us longtime residents will pay the  price as our quality of life deteriorates.  </P> <P> Longtime residents moved here because they preferred a "country lifestyle."  People who want the amenities of a city can live in Escondido. The majority of  Valley Center residents have shown through the election process that they  unequivocally support the slow-growth force. I submit that this majority was  composed of mostly longtime Valley Center residents, in addition to the  relatively few newcomers.  </P> <P> Let the majority rule.  </P> <P> JUDY BROWN  </P> <P> Valley Center  </P></p>

Unarmed officers in civilian clothes,  carrying placards reading "Damn the coup plotters," "Bombers are so crazy" and  "Damn you, bombers," staged a march at dawn to a public park in Manila. They  were joined by about 2,000 others in chanting slogans against the army rebels,  who have attempted six coups against President Corazon Aquino in the past four  years.  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Beijing Central Television Program One  Network in Mandarin at 0605 GMT on 18 February broadcasts the  66-minute fifth of a 10-part series consisting of nine lectures,  and one question and answer session, entitled: "TV Lecture  Series on Several Current Major Programs for Reforming the  Economic System."    The fifth lecture, entitled: "The Banking System," is given  by Zhou Zhengqing, vice president of the People's Bank of China.    Zhou begins by introducing the three aspects of banking  reform he is going to discuss: 1) A brief review of reform of  the banking system over the past 15 years; 2) The main aspects  of and the major measures for the current reform; 3) Several  issues that merit attention in the course of implementing  banking reform.    In reviewing banking reform over the past 15 years, Zhou  describes five aspects of banking reform carried out in China  over the past 15 years: 1) establishing diverse banking  institutions; 2) establishing a central bank system and  gradually implementing an overall banking regulation and control  system combining direct and indirect regulation and control; 3)  developing various banking instruments and forms of credit; 4)  greatly expanding the banking market; and 5) reforming the  foreign exchange control system.    Turning to the main aspects of and the major measures for  the  current banking reform, Zhou summarizes them as: "1) Instituting  an overall regulatory and control system through the central  bank, which will independently implement a monetary policy under  the State Council's leadership; 2) establishing a banking  organizational system under which policy-related banks and  commercial banks are separated, and various banking institutions  exist side by side with state-owned commercial banks serving as  the mainstay; 3) building a unified and open banking market  system based on orderly competition under strict control; 4)  turning the People's Bank of China into a genuine central bank;  and 5) developing the current specialized banks into genuine  commercial banks." Elaborating on these five aspects of banking  reform, Zhou discusses plans to convert the People's Bank of  China into a genuine central bank, to establish three  policy-related banks, to convert the current specialized banks  into commercial banks, to establish rural and urban cooperative  banks, to further expand and improve the banking market, to  correctly guide the healthy development of non-bank financial  institutions, and to reform the foreign exchange control system.    Zhou goes on to discusses several issues that merit  attention  in the course of implementing banking reform. According to him,  these issues concern the need to control the total credit volume  during the transition from the old system to a new one in order  to prevent serious inflation, the impact on loans for  enterprises of the lengthy process of converting state  specialized banks into genuine commercial banks, and the need to  institute a legal system to ensure healthy and orderly progress  in banking reform.    At 0710 GMT Zhou concludes by highlighting the need to  implement the above-mentioned five aspects of banking reform so  that "all banking tasks will better serve the purpose of  establishing and improving the socialist market economic system,  and will make due contributions to promoting sustained, rapid,  and healthy national economic development."</p>

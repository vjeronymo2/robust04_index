			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> TRIBES AIM AT A QUIET REVOLUTION;  </P> <P> IN A PARALLEL TO EVENTS IN EASTERN EUROPE, INDIANS STRIVE TO IMPROVE THEIR  ECONOMIES AND CONTROL THEIR OWN AFFAIRS. BUT FINANCING AND PATERNALISM BEDEVIL  THEM.  </P> <P> From their homes of mud brick, 250 Indians of New Mexico's Pueblo Laguna tribe  head down the road each day to what seems another world -- their jobs at Laguna  Industries, a tribal company that last year produced $15 million in mobile  communication stations and other high-tech hardware for the U.S. military.  </P> <P> At the Ft. Apache Reservation in Arizona, visitors first see the Apache tribe's  untethered horses, which amble down the main drag and even clamber onto the  shady porches of two village churches. But what they see next is the tribe's  ultra-modern computerized lumber mill, where Indian workers will produce 72  million board feet of timber this year.  </P> <P> In Montana, naked Crow tribesmen are praying in sweat lodges this month, and  the young men have just slain three buffalo on Big Horn Mountain, in  preparation for the all-important Sun Dance. Meanwhile, the tribe's attorneys  are at work on an equally critical job: preparing courtroom challenges to  government control of the tribe's water and financial resources.  </P> <P> With a keen eye toward the economic and political transformation taking place  in Eastern Europe, such tribes are pursuing perestroika, Native American-style.  </P> <P> Saddled with staggering unemployment rates of 40% to 80%, they, too, are  attempting a restructuring toward modern capitalism and political reform. And,  in a bid for self-determination, they have begun to wrest control of their  affairs from the historically paternalistic Bureau of Indian Affairs, whose  economic policies, even the BIA admits, have failed.  </P> <P> Their effort is being helped along by Harvard's Kennedy School of Government,  where political economist Joseph Kalt and his students have worked for three  years to define -- and remove -- barriers to prosperity for Indians, the  poorest minority group by far in the United States.  </P> <P> "The parallels to what is happening in the rest of the world are just  transparent," Kalt said. "The economic challenges, the self-determination being  faced now by all of Eastern Europe, is happening here, too."  </P> <P> New constitutions and legal codes are being written that spell out the  mysteries of tribal law to outside investors, and long-term developments are  sprouting on Indian lands where income once came primarily from grazing cattle  or selling souvenirs and cheap cigarettes.  </P> <P> Though the gusts of change come in fits and starts, they are buffeting the BIA,  a bureaucracy that had seemed almost as immovable as the Kremlin once was.  </P> <P> Eddie Brown, assistant secretary of the Interior for Indian affairs and a  Pascua-Yaqui Indian, said the BIA "has a clear mandate from everyone . . . that  we have to change some things, and that the status quo is no longer  acceptable."  </P> <P> But just as Poland faces the almost unimaginable task of creating a private  banking system from scratch, the Indian nations are confronted with huge  obstacles.  </P> <P> Under federal law, they cannot use their lands as collateral, and must dream up  other ways of persuading banks to make development loans. And because of tribal  sovereign immunity, most major corporations have been unwilling to sign  contracts with tribal entities that cannot be hauled to court.  </P> <P> Moreover, Kalt said, tribes such as the Crow are grappling with bizarre forms  of tribal government, foisted upon them by federal officials in the 1930s, that  make self-governing -- and economic development -- virtually impossible.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Legal Issues Complex  </P> <P> So complex are the obstacles that Sue Williams, a Harvard Law School-educated  Sioux who is a leading attorney on Indian matters, holds three-day retreats  with tribal leaders and uses story board drawings as a device to help figure  out which of a host of legal issues to tackle first.  </P> <P> Williams, of Albuquerque, said the failure of Congress to draw sharp lines of  authority between federal, state and tribal governments has created "a  jurisdictional nightmare that horrifies developers" and forces tribes to  repeatedly sue the government over virtually every area of dispute, from  multiple taxation on businesses to water rights.  </P> <P> Kalt, in a 1989 study, wrote that "when actors other than the tribes control  major decisions, the chances of any economic development at all are  substantially reduced." Economic health is improving now, he said, only on  reservations with powerful tribal leaders or strong council governments who  have severely reduced reliance on the BIA.  </P> <P> In one of the most dramatic departures from BIA control, Kalt said, the White  Mountain Apaches in eastern Arizona in 1987 sued the BIA for longtime  mismanagement of tribal lands. Today, the tribe no longer lets BIA officials  attend important tribal meetings.  </P> <P> They have taken a road to independence that includes expansion of the  Apache-owned Sunrise Resort, the largest ski area in the Southwest. It operates  one of the most efficient lumber mills in the West. While quite poor, the  tribe's unemployment rate is only 30%, compared to a BIA estimated average of  40% reservation unemployment nationwide.  </P> <P> This summer, the Apaches are meeting with Merrill Lynch and other financiers  over a proposal to turn an abandoned sawmill into a paper mill.  </P> <P> But with independence has come pain. A depressed lumber market and poor fiscal  decisions by an inexperienced Apache manager, now fired, have led to a work  slowdown at the lumber mill and layoffs of tribal council workers.  </P> <P> And educated Apaches, like Stephanie Joseph, 23, wonder if the reservation will  ever catch up with the outside world. Just laid off from her $11,000-a-year  tribal council job, with which she supported her mother and four siblings,  Joseph said: "I'm trained in Lotus and Word Perfect but there's no computer  jobs here, so we live poor."  </P> <P> Contradictions abound. The movie house is showing "Teenage Mutant Ninja  Turtles," and Apache boys wear "rat tail" hair tufts, just like kids in  Westwood. Yet workers at Sunrise Resort recently asked a medicine man to  exorcise a ghost from the hotel.  </P> <P> Ray Endfield Jr., a former banker, now manager of Sunrise, says the tribe "has  one foot in the 21st Century and one in another era. But this is why we want  tribal control, not outsiders running our lives. We take very seriously the  spiritual needs of our people."  </P> <P> Economist Kalt contends that a series of court rulings and congressional acts  since 1975 has slowly transformed the federal government's role from one of  "guardian" to one of "mentor." But new roadblocks are still being thrown in the  way of Indian self-determination.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ruling Limits Arrests  </P> <P> Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that tribal judges could not jail criminals  who were not local tribal members. Tribes can no longer hold Anglo drunk  drivers, Indian men from other tribes who beat local women to whom they are  married, or other outsiders.  </P> <P> "The feds give lip service to Indian self-determination, and then the Supreme  Court goes and does this damn fool thing," said Cate Stetson, Williams' law  partner and an expert on Indian policy. "Our tribal clients wonder if they can  trust the white man."  </P> <P> Indians, remembering a long history of being duped, have vowed never to be  cheated again. But, as Kalt's research group found when it delved into the deep  poverty among the Crow, some Anglos are still, in effect, buying Indians' fur  pelts with cheap glass trinkets.  </P> <P> The 8,000-member Crow nation in Big Horn County, Montana, owns one of the  world's largest known deposits of coal and great stands of timber. The tribe's  worth is estimated at a stunning $27 billion.  </P> <P> But years ago, the tribe signed a contract with a mining company to extract the  rich coal reserves. Now, Kalt contends, the Crow are being paid "about half the  market value" for coal in Montana.  </P> <P> "I told Joe Kalt we get $3 million a year from all our contracts, and one  student did a little figuring and told us we are getting a rate of return of  .01% -- worse than any Eastern European country," said outgoing Crow Chairman  Richard Real Bird. "We were enticed, forced, pressured and starved out to give  up our resources. Now we want them back."  </P> <P> In the past four years, Real Bird has sued virtually every government agency  involved in Indian matters and launched an all-out political war against the  BIA, which maintains close control over Crow budgets and economic decisions.  </P> <P> But in recent months, the tables have turned against Real Bird. On April 6, he  was convicted of bank fraud -- for misleading banks about available tribal  collateral in order to get loans to buy land that the Crow want to protect near  the famous Custer Battlefield.  </P> <P> He and his attorneys claim that his indictment, and those of other tribal  leaders, is a retaliation by federal officials who want to silence him, a  charge that is denied by federal prosecutors.  </P> <P> Members of the tribe, deeply divided and shamed by heavy coverage of the  indictments in the Anglo-dominated Montana news media, swept Real Bird out of  office in May, electing a Crow employee of the BIA who promised a peaceful  coexistence with the agency.  </P> <P> Kalt said the Crow tribe's inability to rise above destructive internal  politics is caused by its "wholly unworkable" government, created by outsiders  decades ago.  </P> <P> "Crow have the purest form of democracy to be found in North America, with  anyone of voting age also a member of government," Kalt said. "They have a  2,800-member tribal council that is wild -- no rules. Until recently, people  came armed with loaded guns to council chambers."  </P> <P> Last year, in a riotous meeting that landed some Crow in the hospital, tribal  members rejected reforms designed by Real Bird and Kalt to create a normal  government and constitution.  </P> <P> "There is such chaos under the Crow form of government that everything we tried  crashed on the rocks," Kalt said.  </P> <P> While Indian leaders regard the reform of flawed tribal governments as  essential, they also believe that Congress must help tribes attract the  financial backing of lenders and major U.S. corporations.  </P> <P> Williams contends that a federal tax credit is needed to encourage firms to  invest on reservations. And she supports a bill to create an Indian-controlled  federal loan agency that would "take investment decisions out of the hands of  bewildered career personnel at BIA."  </P> <P> But meantime, Indian business leaders question American corporate policies that  would pour investments into faraway Czechoslovakia but largely shun the  stricken Indian nations at home.  </P> <P> "I saw the enthusiasm among the Fortune 500 companies when the walls came down  in Berlin, and yet here we have walls coming down through sheer force of our  will -- but where are the Fortune 500 companies?" asked Ron Solimon, of the  Pueblo Laguna tribe west of Albuquerque.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Exceptions  </P> <P> There are exceptions, however. Purely by accident, Solimon and tribal leaders  struck up a relationship with an executive of Raytheon Co. who helped the  Lagunas design a development strategy that paved the way for a federal loan. A  high-tech factory, Laguna Industries, was born.  </P> <P> "Raytheon was a mentor and teacher to us just when we needed it," said Solimon,  an attorney and president of Laguna Industries. "But we need to see hundreds  more like them in Indian country."  </P> <P> Another tribal firm won a government contract to restore a contaminated  wasteland the size of downtown Los Angeles -- Jackpile, the world's largest  open-pit uranium mine, which closed in 1982.  </P> <P> The success of the two companies appears to have inspired a boomlet of  enterprise on the sagebrush-studded 550,000-acre reservation.  </P> <P> Francisco and Denise Pedro have parlayed an ancient recipe for kiln-baked bread  into a 2,000-loaf-a-week business that ships the soft, frog-shaped loaves out  of state. A modern grocery store has opened in an abandoned warehouse, and last  month, Elaine Sarracino's daughter started a private shuttle service to  Albuquerque using her van.  </P> <P> At Laguna High School, not far from the whitewashed Spanish mission in which  the Lagunas have worshipped continuously since the 1600s, 40% of this year's  seniors are going to college, up from 10% a few years ago.  </P> <P> With the blessings of the tribal council Solimon and Smith are pursuing  development as a way of keeping the young from moving to cities and breaking up  the tribe's deeply spiritual, clan-oriented culture.  </P> <P> But the unemployment rate is still 50%, and the Lagunas still run into doubters  who remember their failed efforts at farming and cattle feedlots in the early  1980s.  </P> <P> Each time the tribe seeks financing from a local bank with which they have done  business for 30 years, it is a struggle.  </P> <P> "To expand Laguna Industries, we had to produce collateral equal to 120% of a  loan, plus a BIA guarantee on 90% of the loan in case of default," Smith said,  shaking his head. "But we're not going to default."  </P> <P> Williams, however, points to "an extraordinary decision" in Arizona, where a  bank recently sealed a development loan to the Gila River tribe with a "Western  handshake."  </P> <P> The bank had concluded that it was impossible to protect itself from  "maddeningly ambiguous" federal laws that make it uncertain whether lenders can  obtain settlements from tribes who default.  </P> <P> Remarkably, Williams said, instead of deep-sixing the loan, "the bank made a  decision based on the history of the tribe repaying its loans and the stability  of its government. They simply decided they trust the tribe."  </P> <P> Such indications of change may be slight, when measured against grotesque  economic conditions that have left half of all Indians living below the poverty  line.  </P> <P> But, Kalt said: "After 100 years of failures upon failures under the thumb of  outsiders, for the first time we are seeing sustainable economic development on  Indian terms."  </P></p>

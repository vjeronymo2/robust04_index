			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Commenting on Another `Gift' After </F> `Cleopatra's Dowry'"]    [Text] British Hong Kong held an Executive Council meeting  on 1 February and announced afterwards that a fourth financial  package for the new airport had been drafted. But Hong Kong  people were kept in the dark, not knowing what kind of a package  it was. Meanwhile, Chris Patten was boasting that the package  was an "excellent Lunar New Year present" to the Hong Kong  people and China.    Chris Patten is totally devoid of self-knowledge. He has  exceeded his role and subverted the truth and has only succeeded  in helping Hong Kong people to see his colonial mind set  clearly. The British are not sending money to Hong Kong to  build the new airport; it is being built by Hong Kong people's  money earned with sweat and blood. In throwing away Hong Kong  people's money, British Hong Kong is at the same time expanding  expenditure on airport construction, almost doubling quotations  for all projects, thus greatly increasing the burden on the Hong  Kong people and debts for the SAR [special administrative  region]. Not long ago, Chris Patten bragged that Britain would  give China the "largest dowry since Cleopatra" when it pulled  out of Hong Kong. Now he is again bragging that he is giving an  "excellent New Year gift" to the Hong Kong people and China.  How generous he is! But should one open his "dowry" and  "gift," one would find nothing but a heavy financial burden. If  it has to be described a "dowry" or a "gift," the beneficiary  will be the British. It is an expensive "tribute" forcefully  wrung from the Hong Kong people by the British. The Tsing Yi-Ma  Wan crossing is a case in point. On the surface, it was an open  bid. But the British rejected a HK$4.7-billion [Hong Kong  dollars] bid from the Korean Hyundai Corporation's and awarded  the project to a British consortium quoting HK$7.2 billion.  Some HK$2 billion was unjustifiably spent in this way. Was  this not the Hong Kong people's gift to the British  colonialists? When Richard Allen of the Provisional Airport  Authority had his employment contract terminated for spending  money like water, he was given a golden handshake of some HK$5  million, which indeed looked like "Cleopatra's" dowry. Every  person in Hong Kong was distressed at being ripped off by  British Hong Kong. But Chris Patten has the nerve to describe  the fourth financial package as a "spring festival gift" to the  people of Hong Kong and China. Is this not utter nonsense? He  is only appropriating a little more from the financial surplus  for the construction of the airport. Hong Kong people are still  footing the bill, and costs have not come down either. How can  this be described as "Chris Patten giving a gift?"    In fact, in mid-July 1991, China and Britain signed the  Memorandum of Understanding on the New Airport [MOU]. If  Britain had not deliberately discarded the MOU to draft  financial packages which created a bottomless pit of "callable  equity" (HK$45 billion by now), deviated from the provisions of  Annex III of the Joint Declaration, which states that China and  Britain share equally the proceeds from the annual sale of 50  hectares of land approved by the Land Commission, and had not  made the improper demand that all revenues from property  developments above the 62-hectare [area of land for development]  railroad line should go to Britain, agreement on a financial  package would have been reached long ago and many projects  launched already. It is British Hong Kong which has been  stalling, turning the situation into a stalemate, and  deliberately creating obstacles. British Hong Kong should be  responsible for the consequences which have resulted from its  opposition to the MOU and the first three financial packages in  the Joint Declaration. Chris Patten is describing the fourth  financial package as a "spring festival gift," but the Hong Kong  people will not be deceived again. Who will accept confusing the  agenda, stalling, and quoting unjustifiably high prices as the  bestowal of a gift?    Conducting business according to the MOU and Annex III of  the  Joint Declaration are the obligations Britain must shoulder. No  civilized country honestly complying with an international  treaty would consider implementing a diplomatic agreement as the  bestowal of a gift.    Whatever package is proposed by British Hong Kong, the Hong  Kong people will strongly demand that its financial arrangements  conform with the MOU and Annex III of the Joint Declaration.  Only thus will the Hong Kong people's tax burden and "ticket  fare" not be increased and can the new airport project avoid low  efficiency or "degenerating into a mess."</p>

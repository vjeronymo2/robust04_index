			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "The National Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Federal District Governor Asdrubal Aguiar has  decided to retire the Metropolitan Police's Commissioners  Command. When the governor explained the reasons that prompted  his decision, he said the following:    [Begin Aguiar recording] I have adopted a decision, of which  I have notified the Metropolitan Police Commander General, to  retire all of the Metropolitan Police's High Command members who  include eight general commissioners and six chief commissioners.    I consider this to be a sound measure for two reasons: On  the  one hand, it is essential to renew and revitalize the  Metropolitan Police's actions; on the other hand, it is  essential to allow some fresh air into its ranks. Moreover, the  group of men who comprise the High Command, and who have  rendered a valuable service to the Venezuelan Police and have  exerted their best efforts in the struggle against crime, have  been in active service for an average of 33 or 34 years.    I believe the time has come--and I instructed the  Metropolitan Police commander general accordingly--for those  eight general commissioners and six chief commissioners, a total  of 14, to make way for the cadre of commissioners and inspectors  who have graduated from the Metropolitan Police's University  Institute. These men have received a refreshing education; they  have new energy and vitality to prepare new plans and actions  against crime in the capital of the Republic; and those who have  rendered valuable services to the Metropolitan Police for 34,  35, or 36 years should finally receive the retirement and rest  they deserve. They should help us as much as possible on an  advisory level which will enable them to cooperate in any way  they can with the capital. [end recording]</p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Million Greeks protest over Macedonia MORE than 1m Greeks gathered in Athens yesterday to demand that the international community withhold recognition from the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia unless it changes its name. The crowd carried banners and shouted 'Macedonia is Greek, Learn Your History' and 'Macedonia has been Greek for 3,000 Years'. Greece fears unrest if its neighbour is recognised as Macedonia. The unease is fanned by the former Yugoslav republic's adoption of the Macedonian star as its emblem. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, yesterday recommended the dispatch of more than 700 troops and military observers to Macedonia. The UN Security Council is expected to act on the proposal later today. Reporting the findings of a recent UN mission to the area, Mr Boutros Ghali said that without international help 'through a potentially turbulent and hazardous period', the Macedonians feared a wider Balkans war. Greece has blocked recognition of Macedonia on the grounds that its name is exclusively Hellenic property and implies territorial pretensions on its own northern province of Macedonia. Macedonian leaders say the blocking of recognition has increased instability. If Greece continues to block recognition, they plan to take their case to the UN. The Macedonian parliament yesterday postponed a decision on changing the name of the republic in order to gain recognition. Yesterday's parliamentary debate was an effort to push EC leaders to grant Macedonia diplomatic recognition at the Edinburgh summit. Mr Hristo Nikovski, undersecretary of the Foreign Ministry, yesterday warned: 'We will look to the UN. . . This situation is feeding nationalists from all sides - inside and outside Macedonia.' Greece is maintaining an unofficial blockade of Macedonia, holding up deliveries of oil. 'We are facing a complete blockade. We are blocked by the sanctions against Serbia to the north, and Greece from the south,' said Mr Nikovski.</p>

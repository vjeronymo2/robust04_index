			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / People: Keys departs from SBJ Tony Keys is to part company with Steel Burrill Jones, the insurance broker whose recent expansion he has helped to orchestrate. Keys, now 51, leaves SBJ in May next year, after over four years with the group. He says the departure is entirely amicable and is part of an overall management and boardroom reorganisation designed to equip the company for a period of slower growth and consolidation. David Beresford Jones, group chairman, is also retiring to devote more time to interests outside the city. Clive Richards, currently a non-executive director, takes over as chairman, and Michael Blackburn and Oliver Stocken join as non-executive directors. SBJ, which was listed in 1985, initially earned most of its profits from broking in the controversial spiral reinsurance market - in which Lloyd's syndicates and companies reinsure each other's exposures to catastrophe losses. Keys and George Boden, who took over as finance director and chief executive, respectively, in 1988, managed the group's successful diversification, buying subsidiaries in other commercial insurance broking businesses. However, as trading conditions have become tougher, growth has slowed and one recent acquisition - that of the Regis Low energy brokerage - has not gone according to plan. 'I'm good at doing deals, developing systems, winning new business,' says Keys, 'I don't enjoy repetition and consolidation which are now necessary to deliver results for shareholders.' Next year he plans to set up a consultancy but recognises that competition could be tough; he is relaxed about prospects. 'I'll set up a little office in EC3. But if the phone doesn't ring it will be a sweet shop in Somerset.'</p>

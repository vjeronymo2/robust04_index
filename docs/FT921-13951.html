			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / International Company News: Westinghouse weakens to Dollars 171m WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the US conglomerate which has been severely hit by bad real estate loans, yesterday underscored the impact of recession on its industrial operations when it reported fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 171m. The profit figure, equivalent to 51 cents a share, compares with a loss of Dollars 449m, or Dollars 1.53 in the same period of 1990, when the company took a Dollars 975m charge to cover real estate and other losses at its troubled financial services subsidiary. However, before making that charge the company reported a net profit of Dollars 284m in the fourth quarter of last year. Revenues in the latest quarter were Dollars 3.4bn, against Dollars 3.7bn. Westinghouse, which took a further Dollars 1.68bn charge in the third quarter of this year to cover problems at the finance company, is trying to sell many of the subsidiary's assets to bolster its balance sheet and reduce debt. It said yesterday it had disposed of about Dollars 700m of corporate financing, real estate and leasing assets in the third quarter. The finance company's total assets now stand at Dollars 8.6bn and it reported a net loss of Dollars 5.1m for the quarter. Among Westinghouse's industrial businesses, operating profits in its electronic systems, industries, office furniture, environmental and broadcasting divisions were all lower during the quarter, mainly due to the recession. However, operating profits for power systems were significantly higher, due to volume increases. For the full year Westinghouse reported a net loss of Dollars 1.1bn, or Dollars 3.46 share, on revenues of Dollars 12.8bn, against net income for 1990 of Dollars 268m, or 91 cents, on revenues of Dollars 12.9bn.</p>

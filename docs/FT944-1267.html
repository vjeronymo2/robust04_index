			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Observer: Brothers sweet for Rolo As the endgame for control of Credito Romagnolo unfolds this week, it is a matter of so far so good for the Bolognese regional bank in its rather eccentric decision to hire both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley as co-advisers. What started off as a hostile move on the part of Credito Italiano, placing a value of L2,000bn on 48.2 per cent of Rolo, has now been raised to a possible L3,290bn for 70 per cent from a Cariplo-led consortium, an infinitely preferable proposition. The two great rivals of global M&amp;A turn out to be happy families in more ways than one. Meet the Zaoui brothers - Michael, the elder, managing director in charge of M&amp;A for Morgan Stanley in southern Europe, and Yoel, four years his junior, an executive director at Goldman Sachs. The pair, who have been co-operating on an often parochial defence revolving around Rolo's regional identity, could themselves hardly be more international. Sporting a north African name, the brothers grew up in Italy, went to business schools in the US and are French nationals. Michael has enjoyed the opportunity to 'get closer' to Yoel, and admits to having dispensed the odd tip along the way. Makes a change. In global advisory work, it is usually Goldman Sachs that plays the big brother.</p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Management: Finance chiefs called to account - Why women accountants leave hospital jobs The secret of attaining a top financial job within the NHS is the ability to drink, Marilyn Palmer was advised early in her career. 'If you can't hold your liquor you will never be a director of finance,' counselled one senior manager. Despite eschewing what she calls the 'boys' club' culture represented by such attitudes, Palmer has successfully scaled the health service ladder from her first job 12 years ago as a clerk to her appointment last year as director of finance for the Anglian Harbours NHS trust, responsible for the Pounds 25m budget of seven hospitals in Great Yarmouth. But it is a lonely position. Figures from the Department of Health show that although 61 per cent of NHS finance staff are women, they hold just 9 per cent of the top grade finance director posts in health authorities and NHS trusts. The findings of a study commissioned by the health department's women's unit go some way towards explaining why. The study, carried out by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, shows that of 208 women who qualified as chartered accountants in the NHS between 1980 and 1990, 31 per cent have left. Of those, the biggest group - 30 per cent - went to local government, 24 per cent left to start families and 2l per cent joined the private sector. Asked why they left, 'personal reasons' were given by 20 per cent but salary came second at 17 per cent. One in five cited lack of career development or job satisfaction. But most alarming is a general perception that women's careers are systematically blocked. More than 70 per cent of those who leave believe they faced barriers to progression within the NHS and 83 per cent of those who stay agree. Among the obstacles given are direct discrimination, outmoded attitudes, absence of childcare and a culture where long, inflexible hours - 50 to 70 a week - are the norm. 'It is generally thought that if you have a family you are no longer career minded, especially among male senior managers,' says one woman. 'It is difficult to get taken seriously by male managers,' says another. Caroline Langridge, head of the women's unit, is promoting a more woman-friendly culture in finance departments. She is also trying to change working patterns that discriminate against female accountants. There is some evidence of success. All posts are open to job-sharing while flexible conditions, like working from home, are encouraged. A register has been set up of women in senior positions who want to be put forward for more senior posts. And it is now NHS policy that every job shortlist contains at least one woman candidate. All this is meant to help boost the number of qualified women accountants and women managers. The latest figures show women slightly outnumber men in studying for accountancy qualifications in the NHS. Women make up 32 per cent of the service's qualified accountants, compared with an estimated 22 per cent a year ago. Pat Macaulay, head of financial development at the NHS management executive, believes cultural change is the key. But it should come 'naturally' as women in senior finance positions become 'role models' and she rejects positive discrimination or quotas.</p>

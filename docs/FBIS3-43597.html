			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement of the National Executive Committee of the ANC </F> on the occasion of the eighty-second anniversary of the ANC,  delivered by President Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela," issued on the  SAPA PR Wire Service on 8 January 1994]    [Text] Compatriots: Today, we mark the 82nd anniversary of  the ANC [African National Congress]. We do so in very special  circumstances. We have arrived at an historic watershed. 1994  is the year in which our country will hold its first ever  democratic elections.    The dreams and the vision of the great patriots who formed  the ANC are about to be realised. The hopes of the millions who  sacrificed for the realisation of that vision are, at last,  about to be fulfilled. Within a few months, all our people  will, as equals, exercise their inalienable and sacred right to  determine the destiny of our country. When the day of  liberation dawns, then shall South Africa, at last, say farewell  to over three centuries of injustice, racial oppression and  exploitation. As we celebrate these victories, we will, at the  same time, be saying farewell to conflict and war, suffering and  despair.  <H5>  Fountain of Inspiration </H5>   As we advance towards the new, we carry with us the great  pride that millions of our people, both black and white, among  them the heroic combatants of Umkhonto We Sizwe [Spear of the  Nation, MK -- ANC armed wing] defied all dangers and death  itself, to achieve these successes. The heroines and heroes who  joined the great offensive for national emancipation and  democracy are legion. Their actions will forever remain a  fountain of inspiration for the generations that will be charged  with the defence and further consolidation of our freedom,  liberty and human rights. The names of the countless martyrs  who sacrificed everything for the liberation of all our people  are registered in the indelible record of our country's forward  march across the boundaries that separate centuries. The  united, democratic, non-racial and non-sexist South Africa which  will soon be our prize, will be the living tribute to their  endeavours, courage and nobility of spirit. It will be the  guarantee that their struggle was not in vain.  <H5>  Victory for All </H5>   Today we speak of democratic elections, of liberation and of  freedom, justice and peace because these millions dared to stand  up, as they continue to do to this day, to say no to oppression,  exploitation and war. The victory they sought was for all the  people of our country. It was not their objective then, and is  not our aim now, to produce a society of conquerors and the  conquered. It was their aim then as it is our objective now, to  liberate all and subjugate none.    When the celebrations come, they must therefore salute a  common homecoming to a common homeland. They must pay tribute  to our collective wisdom as South Africans. They must express  joy in our common discovery of the national will which, forged  in conflict, directed and enabled us to reach across the burning  embers of that confrontation, to end the conflict.    The past year has seen us lay down important additional  foundation stones for the edifice of freedom which we seek to  build. I refer, in particular, to the milestones represented by  the adoption of the transitional constitution and the  establishment of the Transitional Executive Council as well as  other structures charged with the task of preparing for the  elections.  <H5>  Tribute to Martyrs </H5>   What a cruel turn of history it has been that during the  very  year that we took these important strides forward, we lost such  outstanding leaders of our people and important architects of  the democratic victory, as Oliver Tambo and Chris Hani. To them  and others who have lost their lives during this past year,  especially those who have been cut down as a result of the  continuing political violence, we reiterate our homage. We  pledge to them that we shall forever remain loyal to the cause  for which they laid down their lives.  <H5>  Free and Fair Elections </H5>   During this year, as a country and a people, we must  discharge the common responsibility we share of ensuring that  each and everyone of our people freely exercises his or her  hard-won right to elect a government of his or her choice.  Acting together, we must ensure that the people continue, in  practice, to be their own liberators by participating in  elections that are truly free and fair.    The litmus test both of our democratic credentials,  individually and collectively, and the genuineness of the  democratic order, must be whether the elections are in fact free  and fair. All the necessary conditions must therefore be  created to ensure that all voters, in the towns and the  countryside, participate in the elections and participate  without spoiling their ballot papers. We must therefore all  consider it our national task to organise so that every eligible  voter has the necessary means of identification, that each voter  knows how to vote and that each voter reaches a voting station  during the election days.    Equally important, it is our common national task to  guarantee that no voter is intimidated such that either he or  she does not participate in the election or votes in a manner  contrary to what his or her conscience and conviction dictates.  <H5>  Stop the Blood-Letting </H5>   Of central importance is the issue of political violence.  The imperative of peace demands that the carnage must end. The  democratic transition and human decency demand that the blood-  letting must stop. The time has come that the people should  judge the killers for what they are -- murderers who must be  punished according to their just deserts, assassins whom the  voters must reject as the very enemies of democracy, purveyors  of death who cannot be allowed to assume power through terror.    From the very beginning of the establishment of the new  democracy, let us therefore make it clear that what underwrites  the permanence of that democracy is our common commitment to  peace. We must not permit anyone to use force to deny the  unfettered exercise of the will of the people, regardless of the  arms the enemies of democracy bear and regardless of the  brutality of their terror. Together we must bring to naught the  evil intentions of the enemies of democracy and peace, whose  callous actions have already resulted in the loss of the lives  of thousands of innocent people.  <H5>  Resistance to Change </H5>   There are some who, out of fear for the future or too blind  an attachment to the past, seek to stop what is just and  inevitable, through force of arms. The very point we have  reached after three centuries of conflict and confrontation and  a determined resistance to change, speaks of the futility of  this project.    The question that history confronts us with is not whether  South Africa shall be a democratic country. The question that  the opponents of change force onto the national agenda is  whether that democratic order will come after a conflict that  will have turned our country into a wasteland.    The reality must be accepted by all of us that change is the  basic condition for our existence as a country, for our survival  as a people, for the achievement of peace, justice, prosperity  and stability for all.    On this historic occasion in the life of our country, we  therefore call on those who yearn for the false stability of  injustice to understand this fully. They should learn that  their own survival, their capacity to live as human beings,  depends on change and not the maintenance of an intolerable  status quo or the reversion to a forgotten past. We say to them  that they, too, must become part of the collective wisdom of all  our people, out of which has been born the realisation that we  share a common destiny which we must shape together, as equals.  <H5>  Common Destiny </H5>   The forthcoming elections are not just about the demise of  the old order. They begin a process by which the old must yield  to the new. They constitute the first step of our entry into  the modern political world with its concepts and practices of  democracy, fundamental human rights and equality among the  peoples without discrimination on grounds of gender, race,  colour or belief.    The elections will move our country into a new epoch,  enabling all of humanity to take the last step to close the  chapter of colonialism which was first imposed on Africa with  the establishment of the Portuguese colonial empire, five  hundred years ago.  <H5>  Government of the People </H5>   In our fifth month this year, our country will be ruled by a  government born out of this new epoch. This will be a  government which, for the first time in our history, will justly  claim authority because it will be based on the will of the  people. Its central task will be the transformation of South  Africa into a true example of what constitutes the modern world.    The first challenge of that interim government of national  unity will be to begin the process of dismantling apartheid and  transforming South Africa into a democratic, non-racial and non-  sexist country. To dismantle apartheid means to return South  Africa to the hands of all her people. This is the fundamental  thrust that must inform the programme of reconstruction and  development which this government will have to implement.    The old order has plunged our country into a general crisis  affecting all spheres of human endeavour. As a result of the  policies representative of an old epoch, the economy has failed  to feed all our people. It has failed to house them and to  provide them with jobs. It has failed to provide them with good  education, to give them access to good health services -- in  short, to provide them with an acceptable and improving quality  of life.    South Africa's relations with the world economy continue to  be characterised by its colonial origins, resulting in  dependence on the export of raw materials and agricultural  products and an inability to compete effectively in terms of  modern industrial products. The state institutions lack  legitimacy and are not accepted by the overwhelming majority of  our people as being dedicated to ensuring the public good.  Rather they are seen as seats of injustice, affected by rampant  corruption, structured and programmed to serve a tiny minority  at the expense of the majority.  <H5>  Culture of Violence </H5>   Fear of death and injury continue to stalk our land. No one,  old or young, black or white, in the towns and the countryside,  feels safe. The old order, which could only survive on the  basis of violence and brute force, has infused our society with  a culture of violence. We are today reaping the fruits of that  heritage in the form of massive criminal violence, including the  abuse of women and children, violence within families as well as  political thuggery and terrorism.    History has blessed our country with a nation made up of  people with different colours and cultures. The old order  sought to use this reality, which should be a source of joy and  strength, as an instrument for the perpetuation and entrenchment  of injustice, oppression and exploitation. As a consequence of  the encouragement of a destructive racial and ethnic chauvinism,  we are today faced with some in our midst who would seek to  undermine the process of reconciliation and nation building by  appealing to dangerous and primitive instincts of racial and  ethnic exclusiveness.  <H5>  Injustice to Women </H5>   We have also inherited a social structure and social mores  which have condemned the women of our country to the ranks of  the most oppressed and exploited. This has meant the all-round  and sustained suppression of half of our population to the grave  detriment not only of the women themselves but to our country as  a whole. This grave injustice has been codified into law,  justified by an appeal to tradition and sustained by a crude  ideology which trumpets the superiority of the male over the  female.  <H5>  South Africa Belongs to All Who Live in It </H5>   The old order we shall replace has also damaged and  undermined our country's relations with the rest of the world.  South Africa became the seat of aggression and destabilisation,  inflicting enormous damage on the countries of southern Africa.  The loss of our independence and, later, South Africa's  rightful isolation by the nations of the world, have produced a  set of relations which became part of and an expression of the  general crisis produced by the persistence of a social and  political system whose time had long passed.    In this year of liberation, the people of South Africa must  insist that the new government will only earn their trust and  respect if it engages in a serious and determined programme to  end this general crisis by returning our country to all its  people, so that we can truly say that South Africa belongs to  all who live in it, both black and white.  <H5>  Reconstruction and Development </H5>   Many things will therefore have to be done to rebuild the  economy. These measures must ensure that this economy serves  the interests of all our people, enabling us to raise the living  standards of the poor. At the same time, it must attain high  and sustainable rates of growth. Furthermore, steps will have  to be taken so that our country's resources are allocated and  distributed in such a way that we can begin to end the racial  disparities in terms of the distribution of wealth, income and  opportunity.    Many things will also have to be done to restructure the  organs of government so that they are representative of all our  people. All levels of government must serve the people and  operate in a climate of transparency, public accountability and  moral integrity. The ANC commits itself to these objectives.  <H5>  Peace a Priority </H5>   The new government will also have to lead the offensive for  peace, security and stability, building on what has been  achieved through the National Peace Accord, the activities of  the national peace keeping force and the peace struggle of the  masses of the people themselves. This must include improving  the socio-economic conditions of the people, rebuilding of the  services responsible for the maintenance of law and order, and  improving their relationship with the communities they serve.    We are confident that the members of Umkhonto We Sizwe,  integrated into a new national defence force, will play a  critical role in the achievement of these objectives.    Above all, we must draw the people themselves into a  determined campaign to expunge the curse of violence from our  society.    Through action, the women of our country should also ensure  that they, the rest of our population and the new government  focus on the fundamental question of the emancipation of women  by addressing such matters as their socio-economic upliftment,  raising their levels of education and training, ensuring their  participation in decision-making structures and creating the  conditions for their liberation from demobilisation by household  chores.    Soon our country will take its rightful place among the  nations. This process will give us the opportunity so to  position ourselves that we can play our own role in the building  of a world of peace, freedom and respect for human rights while  establishing and strengthening a system of mutually beneficial  relations with the peoples of the world, beginning with the  countries of southern Africa.  <H5>  Rise to the Challenge </H5>   Whatever the details of these programmes, we must ensure  that  within a relatively short period of time, our country emerges  out of the crisis imposed upon it and becomes a true land of  hope. This we will achieve if, as we must, we begin to build  new houses, give better education to the youth, raise the  standard of living of especially the poor, attend to the  pressing environmental questions, strengthen the spirit of  solidarity among all our people, ensure peace and security for  the people and enable the people to govern.    In the fight for a healthy population, we must, among other  things, halt the spread of HIV and AIDS, while treating its  victims in a humane manner, based on the principles contained in  the bill of rights. We still have a chance to arrest the  proliferation of this pandemic.    Faced as we are with the terrible inheritance of massive  unemployment, top priority must be given to the creation of  jobs. Related to this, we will also have to adopt programmes to  ensure that those who have been left behind by apartheid, are  given the opportunity to catch up and work side by side with the  rest of their compatriots, as people of equal competence. This  is the true essence of a policy of affirmative action.    The question of the protection and the development of  children must also been given the emphasis and attention it  deserves. The requisite resources will have to be allocated to  meet the objectives which the whole world pursues for the  promotion of the interests of the children.    The land hunger which affects many of our people must also  be  addressed. We are convinced that this can and must be done  without threatening those who work the land today and help to  feed the nation.    We must meet all these challenges as a people and not merely  leave them to the government that we shall all have elected.  Our success as a country and the very imperative of building a  genuine democracy, require that all structures of civil society  should themselves be involved in confronting these challenges.  These structures, among them the civic organisations, are  important instruments both of socio-economic development and  democratic participation in reconstruction. We are confident  that they will take timely measures to gear themselves to play  this new role, in keeping with the aspirations of the millions  they represent, for a decent standard of living, peace and  stability. We therefore call on all sectors of our population  to rise to the challenge and join hands for the remaking of our  country into a common home that we can all be proud of.  <H5>  The Youth </H5>   The challenge facing our youth is to remain at the forefront  of the struggle for change. They must be among those in the  vanguard of the important effort to ensure that the elections  are free and fair and among those who must lead in rebuilding  our country. They, who are the pride and the hope of our  nation, also have a serious responsibility to prepare themselves  through education and other means, so that they can both build  and inherit a future of peace, democracy, prosperity and  stability.  <H5>  Efforts of the Working People </H5>   The prosperity which all our people deeply yearn for will  come about as a result of the efforts of our working people, who  have themselves been at the vanguard of the struggle to end the  system of white minority rule. Continuing in that role, they  too, under the leadership of their trade unions, have a  responsibility to help create the conditions of democracy and  peace which will ensure the creation of new jobs and  implementation of the economic reconstruction programme, which  are such a vital part of the process of building the new South  Africa.    It is also critically important that the trade union  movement  should continue to make its contribution to the development of a  national consensus with regard to the objective of building a  prosperous economy which would end unemployment, provide a  living wage for all, raise levels of productivity and  international competitiveness and ensure proper participation by  workers in decision making at their places of work.    There are some among our working people who benefited from  job reservation and racial discrimination in the past. Some of  these continue to cling to a misguided hope that the old order  can be restored. It remains the responsibility of the  progressive trade union movement to join in the effort to  persuade these that their fundamental interests can only be  served by their full participation in the process of democratic  change.  <H5>  Central Role of the Religious Community </H5>   The religious community of our country has also played a  central role in the struggle to achieve justice and peace for  all our people. To these great patriots, to whom we reiterate  our commitment to freedom of worship, we say that the goal you  set yourselves, inspired by the humanist teachings of all the  great faiths, has not yet been achieved.    In particular we believe that you have a central role to  play  in ensuring that the elections are free and fair, by paying  especial attention to the questions of voter education and  mobilisation and addressing the critical question of political  violence. Similarly, an important responsibility rests on your  shoulders to help ensure genuine reconciliation among all our  communities and the strengthening of the ties that bind them as  part of one human family. In addition, we believe that the  religious community should gear itself to participate in the  programme for reconstruction and development so that, through  community based activities, it helps the ordinary people to  escape from the terrible prison of poverty, deprivation and  human degradation.  <H5>  Call to Traditional Leaders </H5>   We would also like to make a special call to the traditional  leaders, who have an important role to play in the new society.  They, too, owe it to the country to ensure that those who fall  under their jurisdiction are given every possibility to  participate in the process of the peaceful transformation of our  country. The new constitution has already given a place to  these leaders of our people, reflecting the common recognition  of the important role they must continue to play. That role  demands of them that, as of old, they must continue to serve the  interests of the people, in the spirit of our new democracy.  <H5>  Partnership With Business </H5>   The business community, both black and white, constitutes an  important sector of our society and a valuable asset in the  historic effort to bring a better quality of life to all our  people. We appeal to these compatriots themselves to play their  part in building confidence in the future of our country. The  critical and positive decisions which they take will impact on  the welfare of the millions of our people as well as the success  of the democratic transition itself. We are committed to join  hands with them in a partnership for progress and change, for  peace and stability, economic growth, equity and prosperity for  all, fully understanding that the public and private sectors are  both important players in the battle to secure a better life for  the people.  <H5>  Responsibility of Professionals </H5>   A similar message goes to all the professionals of our  country on whose hands falls the responsibility of ensuring  that, in all fields, we become a country of excellence. Central  to our success will be the contribution of all our educators.  Inspired by the drive to banish ignorance and mediocrity, they  must help the country to learn and learn again, regardless of  whether one participates in adult education, the training of  skilled workers or the preparation of specialists in pure  science.    They must be in the forefront of a campaign to eliminate the  scourge of illiteracy and to reestablish a culture of learning  and teaching.  <H5>  Lessons From the Past </H5>   We would further like to address a special message to all  those who see themselves as leaders or representatives of any of  the racial and ethnic groups of our country. To them all we say  if anything is to be learnt at all from the last three centuries  of our country's history, it is that all our peoples belong  together. All efforts in the past to separate and divide them,  to present them as having interests that are mutually exclusive  and to prescribe different destinies for them, has led to  conflict and war and the crisis from which our country is now  striving to extricate itself.    None who has the genuine interests of any of these sectors  of  our population can condemn them to that proven past of pain and  misery, derived from the false and dangerous concept of separate  development or unique ethnic interests.  <H5>  Build One Nation </H5>   We are greatly strengthened by the fact that, as part of the  black oppressed, the coloured and Indian communities have  rejected these notions and have therefore continued to stand on  the side of freedom and a common nationhood. So also have many  of our white compatriots come over to the vision of one  non-racial South Africa, vindicating the positions of those  whites who, however few in number, refused to be bribed into  accepting white domination.    Let us therefore all join together to build our national  unity, regardless of the colour of our skin, the language we  speak at home and the religion we profess. Together we must do  what our country and all its children cry out for -- to build  one nation, inspired by a common patriotism and love for the  rich diversity of cultures which is our common heritage.    We would also like to make this call to all political  formations in our country, that whatever the differences among  them, however vigorously they will contest the election ahead of  us, they share a common responsibility to rise above the merely  partisan and sectarian. Together we must do everything that is  necessary to ensure that the April elections are free and fair.  Together, we must act in a way that will produce the united,  democratic, non- racial and non-sexist South Africa to which we  all committed ourselves at the very beginning of the process of  the multi-party negotiations.  <H5>  Hope for the Future </H5>   We must all remain true to the agreements we have reached.  We, for our part, reiterate our firm commitment to honour the  accords arrived at during the process of negotiations.    The whole democratic movement of our country, including the  Patriotic Front and the tripartite alliance, has the  responsibility to lead our country, no longer as a movement of  resistance, but as the historic force for change on whose  shoulders rests the hope of the majority of our people for  peace, democracy and a better life.    The ANC itself must continue to improve its capacity to  serve  the people. This will mean organisation and yet more  organisation to enable us to continue to mobilise and lead. We  must ensure that we continue to maintain contact with the masses  of the people and respond to their needs and aspirations. All  our members, in the branches, regions and nationally must  continue to be motivated by the motto -- we serve the people of  South Africa!    We have, together, created the statutory organs that will  take our country forward to its democratic future. These  include the Transitional Executive Council, the Independent  Electoral Commission, the Independent Media Commission and the  Independent Broadcasting Authority. We extend our best wishes  to all who serve on these important structures, pledge our  support to them and commit ourselves to co-operate with them for  the success of the common project.    We are confident that they will discharge their  responsibilities in a fitting manner, conscious of the decisive  consideration that theirs is not to serve a sectional or party  interest but to create the conditions which will enable all our  people to break out of their shackles.  <H5>  We Pay Tribute </H5>   As we approach our day of liberation, we extend special word  of gratitude to the millions of people throughout the world, the  anti- apartheid movement, other popular organisations,  governments and inter-governmental organisations all of whom  have been an important motive force in moving our country  forward to the modern age.    As part of the continent of Africa, we pay special homage to  the OAU and the frontline and neighbouring states whose peoples  made such great sacrifices in support of our liberation  struggle. The new South Africa will play its role in the  struggle for the all- round development of our continent as an  equal partner with all other countries and a force for peace and  stability. Their work, like ours, is also not yet done. We  appeal to them to continue to contribute what they can to ensure  a smooth transition to a democratic order and the rebuilding of  South Africa into a country which they will be proud to describe  as a friend and a reliable partner.  <H5>  Racism Has No Future </H5>   Here, on these southern shores of the African continent, all  humanity has the possibility to produce a result which will  confirm that racism has no future, that the domination of one  people by another has no place in the new world, that it is  possible for a multi-cultural society to thrive in a situation  of peace and harmony and that the peoples of our continent have  as much a capacity as any other to achieve an all-round human  success.    Our salute to the world community and the expression of our  gratitude for what it has done to emancipate all our people,  will be the victory we shall all score by the establishment of a  united, democratic, non-racial and non-sexist South Africa.    It will be represented by our deeds as a democratic country  when we act in solidarity with those who are oppressed and  despised and play our role in the common effort to create a new  world order of justice, peace, human rights and prosperity for  all.  <H5>  The People Shall Govern! </H5>   We extend our best wishes to all our people and assure them  that what continues to motivate us is neither personal gain not  party interest. On our banners are inscribed the glorious words  and the inviolate covenant -- the people shall govern!    Compatriots: Now is the time for this noble objective to be  fulfilled. Now is the time that we make a decisive break with  the past. Now is the time that we join forces as South Africans  to make our country free at last. As this historic year begins,  let all our thoughts and actions celebrate this as the year of  liberation for all South Africans.    Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika!    God Bless Africa!</p>

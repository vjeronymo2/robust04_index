			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHILD ABUSE  </P> <P> In response to Donna Caffrey's letter ("Addicted Baby," Dec. 28):  </P> <P> Yes, it is very sad that Michael Hudson was born addicted to cocaine. What is  even sadder is Caffrey's statement that "giving birth to a sick baby and having  him taken away from her" is punishment enough for Toni Hudson, the infant's  mother.  </P> <P> This woman knew as do all potential drug addicts that cocaine is addictive.  Willingly abusing drugs is not a disease, it is a choice. Toni Hudson of her  own free will decided to take cocaine. There was no disease to impair her  judgment or cause her to take it against her will. The only disease she is  suffering from is stupidity.  </P> <P> She is guilty of child abuse from the moment she decided not to take or use  birth control. There is enough information available to her and other potential  drug addicts to warn them against the dangers of drug abuse, and the harmful  effects to pregnant women and their unborn children. Again, it was her choice  not to use birth control and her choice to use cocaine.  </P> <P> Isn't being born to a mother who totally disregarded his health and welfare and  being placed in a hospital to suffer during his young life punishment enough  for Michael?  </P> <P> SANDRA ORTIZ-LOPEMAN  </P> <P> Downey  </P></p>

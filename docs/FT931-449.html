			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Struggle to clinch a sale: Prospects for privatisation in the Czech and Slovak republics Last year, the voucher scheme to put the assets of the now-divided republic of Czechoslovakia into private hands held out the hope of prosperity for millions of ordinary Czechs and Slovaks. But those who participated in the privatisation programme - one of the most ambitious in the former communist bloc - are now wondering when - or if - they will receive their shares. Investors were given a jolt last week when the Czech government announced it was preparing to seize shares in Czech industry due to be allocated to Slovak investors. The move reflects a deterioration in relations between the two new republics arising from a bitter dispute over the allocation of assets belonging to the former Czechoslovakia - ranging from national reserves to state buildings. Under the privatisation scheme, applicants bought vouchers which they could use to bid for shares. Every citizen aged 18 or more could buy one voucher book for Kcs1,035 (USDollars 35) - roughly equivalent to a week's wages. Each book was worth 1,000 investment points to be used to bid for shares in five bidding rounds. The first round was held in June 1992, and the final round was held last December. Shares were to be transferred, starting yesterday, but distribution has been delayed until after Slovak investors have been identified. The Slovak government reacted angrily to the announcement from Prague, but ruled out retaliatory action. The move also dismayed investment fund managers who believe the action could undermine confidence in the nascent Czech stock market. The Czech government insists its privatisation programme will not be affected; shares will be transferred to Czech investors after what it hopes will be only a short delay. Slovak investors will be given partial compensation. None the less, uncertainty surrounding the scheme has been heightened. No one knows quite what to expect when the shares are finally transferred. Officials hope the programme will give birth to a lively securities market and bolster the countries' emerging market economies. But some economists warn of a collapse in share prices from their nominal values and of confidence in capitalism. The truth probably lies somewhere in between, with winners as well as losers among the 8.5m investors who bought stakes indirectly in 1,500 companies with an estimated book value of more than Dollars 10bn. A handful of financial institutions will make big gains. Many small investors may jump at the opportunity to make a quick profit by cashing in their shares, while others, with stakes in heavily loss-making companies, will be left with worthless paper. In the background, foreign investors are watching closely. The decision to privatise state industry through a voucher scheme was the preferred option of the Czechoslovak government because it believed it would provide the widest possible dispersion of assets. Initially, the government's offer met a lukewarm response. But interest grew when Prague-based Harvard Capital and Consulting (HC&amp;C), a private investment fund, offered to buy portfolios from investors for 10 times the nominal price of their voucher books one year after the distribution of shares. Other funds followed, offering similar or higher returns. The prospect of certain profit enticed inexperienced investors to buy vouchers and leave it to the funds to make the investment decisions. The response to the funds' offers created an unexpected concentration of privatised assets. According to a recent report by PlanEcon, the US consultancy group, the nine largest funds - there are more than 400 - control almost half of all investment points. By contrast, direct investment by individuals accounts for only 28 per cent of vouchers. 'What you have is not a new class of entrepreneurs, but a change in ownership. Instead of government ministries, the bulk of what was privatised is now controlled by a small group of private institutional investors,' says Mr Jan Vanous, president, of PlanEcon. Mr Jiri Skalicky, Czech privatisation minister, is cautious about interpreting these developments. 'I cannot say that I'm happy with this situation, or not. What is important is how the voucher funds will operate and act as managers.' Individual funds cannot hold more than 20 per cent in privatised companies - those with larger stakes must sell surplus shares by the end of the year. Mr Skalicky says this will ensure single investors cannot block decisions. But funds have already joined forces in some companies to impose management changes. 'The funds don't have share certificates yet, but they're acting like shareholders and they want to influence the running of companies,' says Mr Richard Surrey, an executive with Squire, Sanders &amp; Dempsey, the US law firm which has helped to implement the privatisation programme. But many funds are short of cash to make good their promises to investors and will be under considerable pressure to sell shares to raise money. Moreover, they have no experience in managing extensive portfolios or manufacturing companies. The fear is that they will seek quick returns by selling company assets. Mr Skalicky says these problems should not be exaggerated. 'The funds will behave differently. Some will focus on a smaller number of companies in which they'll want to play an active role; others will act more like portfolio managers. The market won't collapse.' Not everyone agrees. 'The market is shallow. If funds have to sell shares, it will cause problems, though there are lots of foreign investors waiting exactly for that to happen,' Mr Surrey says. Foreigners could not invest directly in voucher privatisation, but they will be able to buy shares on the secondary market. 'Labour costs are about one tenth of those in Germany. It's an ideal situation for a foreign company wanting to buy a factory or two,' says one analyst. Analysts expect foreign investors will have an important influence on the market's development. 'The behaviour of foreign investors will be critical in determining how deep the initial plunge in (share) prices is, and when the recovery takes place,' says PlanEcon. It may also determine whether investors think it worthwhile to hold on to their shares and whether the objective of popular capitalism will be attained. For many investors, however, that dream may already have been swept away by the dispute between the two new republics.</p>

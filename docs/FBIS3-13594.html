			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 16 Mar (INA)--Two Iraqi newspapers have  urged the UN Security Council [UNSC] to embark on the process of  lifting the sanctions clamped on Iraq without delay,  particularly since Iraq has honored its commitments as enshrined  in the relevant UNSC resolutions.    In an editorial today, the newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH says that  the United Nations and some other parties have underscored, from  the outset, that the elimination of Iraq's chemical and  biological weapons, missiles, and nuclear materiel must be  followed by lifting the economic sanctions within the context of  a "package deal."    The paper indicates that the "package deal" concept is a  legal one. The legal aspect of this concept means that there  are reciprocal commitments between Iraq and the United Nations.    The paper goes on to say that using compliance with  international resolutions as a tactical cover to make Iraq honor  its commitments without expecting the UNSC to honor its own  commitments is a dangerous game that undermines the credibility  of the United Nations, and opens the door for further crises and  regional and international turmoil.    The paper says that those who are concerned about peace,  security, and rights are required to honor their commitments,  and to act rapidly to deliver on their agreements. The paper  warns that Iraq's patience and wisdom in no way means that Iraq  will allow the infliction of further destruction and harm on its  people.    AL-JUMHURIYAH adds: The United Nations and those standing  behind it must understand that peoples have the right to defend  themselves, their destinies, and their interests with all  available means when the avenues of hope before them are blocked.    The paper addresses the current U.S. position, which is  grounded in exposed political motives and objectives. It also  touches upon the UN position, as explained by Rolf Ekeus,  chairman of the UN Special Commission, which seeks to perpetuate  the embargo even after its legal justifications have been  removed.    In contrast, the paper notes some positive international and  regional changes that have surfaced over the past four months,  developments that have signaled that it is high time the embargo  clamped on Iraq was lifted, either partially or entirely.    The paper emphasizes that the Iraqi people have observed  that  the overwhelming majority of nations are now demonstrating an  understanding of their positions and of their reasoning after  years of misunderstanding. It goes on to say that while the  Iraqi people appreciate these stands, they are also capable of  changing the current equations, based on their legitimate right  to a free and decent living.    Concluding its editorial, AL-JUMHURIYAH wonders: Will  Washington understand all this and retreat? Or is it determined  to persist with its criminal acts against the Iraqi people,  something that would herald new and dangerous political  developments in the region, and the world?    The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH urges the UNSC to honor its  commitments, as the dictates of fairness and justice require,  particularly since Iraq has complied with all relevant UNSC  resolutions. If they do not see any hope for removing the  injustice meted out against them, our people will have no choice  but to decide, along with their leadership, on the means to  create other hope, the paper adds.    In an analysis today, the paper asserts that Iraqis have the  right to choose the kind of life they want to lead, to resist  the embargo with all possible legitimate means, and to  demonstrate inventiveness with regard to the form and content of  this resistance when they find that hopes for a positive UNSC  move are tightly blocked.    The paper criticizes the United Nations' failure to honor  its  commitments toward Iraq as enshrined in UNSC resolutions, noting  that Iraq has demonstrated exemplary commitment and a high sense  of responsibility in its dealings with the world body, which  professes to be an advocate of fairness, justice, and human  rights, to help cope with this or that hurdle in the hope that  the UNSC members will rise to the required level of humanitarian  and historical responsibility.    For its part, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH blames this failure  on  the United States and Zionism, contending that they have  conspired against Iraq and prevented the UNSC from playing the  honest role of lifting the sanctions imposed on Iraq.    The paper adds: The aggressiveness of both the West and  Zionism has nothing to do with the events unleashed on 2 August  1990. Rather, it is connected with Iraq's special and effective  role, and with the pan-Arab and unity-orientated principles it  cherishes. Similarly, it has something to do with the scientific  and technological accomplishments Iraq has made --  accomplishments that have broken the myth of Israel's  superiority in the region.    The paper adds: The prime objective of the United States and  Zionism is to weaken Iraq's military and economic capabilities  and halt its creative potential.</p>

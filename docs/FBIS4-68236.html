			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Rear-Admiral Viktor Makarov by </F> Captain-Lieutenant Albiy Shudrya: "`The Institute is Being  Reformed, Not Dissolved'"]    [Text] Reports have appeared in the city newspaper  SLAVA SEVASTOPOLYA and other Crimean publications on significant  cutbacks in cadets at the Naval Institute. The authors of those  features assert that the higher educational institution is in  complete decline, and its graduates have no prospects with  regard to the service. They ask whether it would not be better  to train lieutenants for the fleets of Russia, and not only for  the Ukrainian Navy. What is the sense of the cutbacks that are  taking place? A discussion by the senior officer of the press  center of the Ukrainian Navy, Captain-Lieutenant Albiy Shudrya,  with SVMI [Sevastopol Naval Institute] Chief Rear-Admiral Viktor  Makarov began with that question.    [Makarov] The Armed Forces of Ukraine are being cut back as  a  whole; their size has been defined by the Supreme Soviet. The  quantitative composition of the Navy is defined accordingly, and  orders are placed from the state on that basis. We also train  specialists for Derzhkomatom [State Committee for Nuclear Power]  and Derzkomkordon [State Border Commission]. As for the training  of officers for the Russian Navy, Russia itself has refused  this, taking out all cadets who did not take the Ukrainian oath.  No one demanded any payment for the training of those cadets. We  were prepared to complete their training without charge, in  accordance with the Dahomys and Yalta agreements. Proceeding  from some political views or ambitions, all of those people who  did not want to study here were called back from Sevastopol in  April of 1993.    We are prepared to work according to that plan, however.  Belarus will possibly order some specialists--they do not have  very many military schools--and Kazakhstan could also resolve  the issue of training cadres here.    If such a proposal were to appear, we would of course study  it...    The institute is not collapsing and is not being dissolved,  but is rather being reformed. The group of those who want to  study is being cut back, as is occurring at all of the higher  educational institutions of Ukraine--both civilian and military.  The state will be training as many specialists as it requires.  The laboratory base, simulators, a number of departments and  support personnel are all being preserved at the institute. Some  naval services are being accommodated in the freed-up spaces,  close to 50 percent of the premises today. As for the  accommodation of subunits of the National Guard, that is  disinformation.    [Shudrya] Why were more cadets than are needed accepted last  year?    [Makarov] We were proceeding from the Yalta and Moscow  agreements between Ukraine and Russia. The discussion concerns  the division of the Black Sea Fleet [ChF] in a ratio of 50  percent to 50 percent. The order for the training of specialists  was placed with a regard for that. We know today, however, that  the resolution of the issue of the Black Sea Fleet at Massandra  has been disrupted, and this group became unnecessary. The  graduates of 1992-93 were thus greater than the requirements for  officers. Some of the graduates, true, were sent to replenish  the Ukrainian Navy. The ChF command, however, did not display  any interest in assigning the young officers to vacant  positions. Many of the graduates were discharged into the  reserves.    [Shudrya] The cutbacks in cadets will lead to cutbacks in  instructors. What will happen to the officers and scientific  staff members?    [Makarov] We will not be dismissing the instructors, and do  not intend to let anyone go. The naval scientific-research  center is still far from fully staffed. There are many vacancies  at command levels of the institute, and commanders of subunits,  companies and departments are needed. There are also quite a few  positions in the Ukrainian Navy that would suit our officers as  well. I had a conversation with the Commander-in-Chief of the  Navy, and I can report that such an opportunity will be granted  in a case where there is a desire to continue service. There are  also quite a few higher positions in the department of the Navy  or at the newly created Armed Forces Institute of Ukraine.    [Shudrya] Newspaper features assert that the recruitment of  cadets will now take place in Kiev. Has there really been such a  decision?    [Makarov] There is such a version. People should come to the  institute from other regions, not just from Sevastopol. Such an  imbalance still exists. I feel that this is not entirely fair to  the other inhabitants of Ukraine. The more so as many of the  oblasts have assumed sponsorship of the Ukrainian Navy. Rivne  Oblast, for example, is sponsoring the SVMI. The sponsors have  assumed the obligation of sending their own representatives to  take the examinations on a competitive basis.    [Shudrya] The institute has a good physical plant. Will it  be  preserved?    [Makarov] The physical plant that is needed by the Ukrainian  Navy will be preserved, and no questions whatsoever can arise  here. We do not intend to eliminate and dismantle it, but are  rather proposing to use it, as before, for the training of  cadets. As for a new physical plant, it still needs to be  resolved where it will be.    [Shudrya] Tell me, if you would be so kind, will young men  from Sevastopol be trained at the SVMI?    [Makarov] I have no doubt of it. The opportunities for  access  to the institute are the same for everyone. Knowledge, a desire  to become a sailor, physical fitness and endurance, however,  have to be mandatory. These criteria have always been taken into  account. Today, in connection with the fact that the recruiting  will be cut back, they move to the forefront. Our task is to  select the best, wherever they may come from. Many unfortunately  enter the institute only in order to study for a year or two in  order to avoid the draft, and then leave. There are people from  Sevastopol among those as well. I do not want us to err in  selecting those for whom naval service is the path of the  romantic.</p>

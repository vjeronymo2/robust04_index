During the meeting Aliyev discussed  future relations of Azerbaijan with Russia, and noted that "both  countries are suffering difficult conditions where our joint  efforts may help to eliminate the difficulties."    Speaking about the Armenian aggression, Aliyev said that "we  had expected Russia to play a just and objective role".    Aliyev noted that the fates of more than one million Azeri  refugees, whom many countries are helping. "Why is Russia not  assisting the these Azeri refugees?" asked Aliyev.    The Azeri President also talked about the resumption of  economic links between the two countries. "Today not only  Azerbaijan, Russia, as well, is suffering from the break in  economic links with us".    In reply, Sergey Baburin said that "today reviewing the  Azeri- Armenian conflict there is a double standard, and I don't  understand the position of those who speak about Azerbaijani  aggression at the present when considerable territory of  Azerbaijan has been seized."    Baburin said that the delegation is scheduled to visit to  the  front line and meet with refugees and report to the State Duma  and commission leaders about the visit upon return.    The fact-finding mission's function is also to look into the  situation of the Russian-speaking population in Azerbaijan.  "Azerbaijan is the most favoured republic among the CIS  countries in respect to this question".    Speaking of the establishment of economic ties, Baburin  said,  "that when the CIS countries re-establish contact amongst  themselves or amongst countries abroad, and when Russia  interferes in this process, this is bad for Russia."</p>

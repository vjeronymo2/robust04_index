			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINANCING FOR RAIDERS DEAL IS MILLIONS SHORT, MEMOS REVEAL  </P> <P> A new exchange of angry memos among those who have been, at various stages,  responsible for trying to put together Irwindale's stadium deal with the Los  Angeles Raiders is providing fresh evidence that the city remains short of  financing for the $150-million project.  </P> <P> In one memo, sent late last week to Irwindale City Manager Charles Martin,  attorney Robert Corrado, who was retained by the Irwindale City Council on this  and other matters, remarks that the city is $35 million "short . . . in trying  to finalize the deal with the Raiders."  </P> <P> Corrado, criticizing a recently fired Irwindale negotiator with the Raiders,  Fred Lyte, wrote at another point that Lyte's failure to "deliver crucial  items" of financing and political support for the project has left Corrado and  other current negotiators "trying to keep the deal together without those  crucial elements."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Project 'Jeopardized'  </P> <P> In a rebuttal memo released Tuesday that was also addressed to the city  manager, Lyte said that the city's stadium project with the Raiders is now  "jeopardized" and suggested that the new negotiators are "amateurs."  </P> <P> Lyte lamented the recent firing by the City Council of yet another negotiator,  Washington attorney Kenneth Adams.  </P> <P> "I am sure that opponents of the Raider project are greatly amused at this turn  of events," Lyte remarked. He described Adams as "highly successful" in his  efforts to defend and consummate the Irwindale-Raider deal and deplored "his  replacement as attorney (for the city) by a criminal lawyer (Corrado) and  another lawyer (Michael D. McCaffrey), both with little background in either  this project or the sports field."  </P> <P> Adams, dismissed March 23 by a 3-2 vote of the City Council, said in an  interview Tuesday that the memos, and the public airing of financial shortfalls  in the Raider negotiations, are "all very unfortunate."  </P> <P> "At the point that I departed, I was confident that the deal could be  financed," Adams said. "It was a doable deal. Such stadium deals are always  thin. This would not be easy. There were big obstacles, but it was doable."  </P> <P> Now, however, Adams said he fears that "this kind of public dispute within the  Irwindale group can only make it difficult for everyone to accomplish the  people's objective, which is to bring the Raiders to Irwindale."  </P> <P> Raider officials, who have seen a parade of different Irwindale negotiators  propose various arrangements to them in the nearly two years since the team  first announced that it would move to the small San Gabriel Valley city from  the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, had no comment Tuesday on the latest  developments.  </P> <P> In his memo, Corrado accused Lyte, then an Irwindale redevelopment consultant,  of failing to deliver on financial or other support commitments "on four  previous occasions in the Raider deal." Specifically, Corrado cited Lyte's  assurances that:  </P> <P> * The Miller Brewing Co. would provide $19 million for advance payments to  Raiders' owner Al Davis.  </P> <P> * He would deliver $35 million from other major companies in the area to help  fund the stadium construction.  </P> <P> * He would handle political problems with Los Angeles County government to  secure parking land for the stadium.  </P> <P> * He would handle political problems over the parking with the U.S. Army Corps  of Engineers.  </P> <P> Lyte, in his rebuttal, said the request to Miller brewery for the $19 million  had been turned down before the Irwindale City Council had approved the idea of  a Raider deal.  </P> <P> "As to my 'promise' to get major companies to contribute $35 million to the  Raider project, I was legally stopped from doing this while Irwindale was under  (a court restraining order delaying Raider negotiations) which ended in  February, 1989," Lyte said. He noted that he had been fired before the court  order was lifted.  </P> <P> Because the court order banned any further negotiations until an environmental  impact report was prepared, Lyte said he was legally barred from working on the  political problems with the county and the Corps of Engineers.  </P> <P> Corrado also suggested in his memo that Lyte had recommended the services of  the Washington law firm of Dickstein &amp; Shapiro, for which Adams worked, in  part because the firm employed Lyte's son-in-law. The firm "cost the city more  than $1 million in legal fees" before Adams was dismissed, he noted.  </P> <P> Lyte said that at the council's request he conducted a search for a legal  adviser "among about 30 leading law firms" and that in recommending Dickstein  &amp; Shapiro he had "fully disclosed that my son-in-law, Bruce Holcomb, was  one of the 150 junior members" of that firm.  </P></p>

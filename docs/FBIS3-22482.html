Provincial medical officer Dr. Godfrey Chishimba said 978  cases of measles had been recorded and the death toll could be  higher because some occurred in remote areas without the  knowledge of health personnel.    Dr. Chishimba said most of the deaths occurred between  January and September in nine places under chiefs Kambombo,  Tembwe, Chibale, Mulilo and Chikwa.    A team of medical staff had been sent to the affected areas  to immunise people against the killer disease and that another  group will soon go there to carry out another round of  immunisation.    Dr. Chishimba who complained of erratic supply of drugs to  the province to contain the disease said the situation was under  control.    But reports reaching Chipata from Chama say there is a fresh  outbreak of the disease and more people are dying especially in  Chief Kambombo's area.    [Passage omitted]</p>

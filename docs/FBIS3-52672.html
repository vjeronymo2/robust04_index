			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hemi Shalev] </F>   [Text] The United States has submitted a diplomatic  demarche to Israel over the government's construction plans in  "Greater Jerusalem" and over the intention to integrate Ma'ale  Adumim with the capital.    The demarche, which is very unusual in light of the good  relations currently prevailing between the Clinton  administration and the Israeli Government, was submitted by U.S.  Ambassador William Brown to Eytan Bentzur, the deputy director  general of the Foreign Ministry.    The protest came after U.S. officials were amazed by a map  given to Samuel Lewis, head of policy planning at the State  Department, by Construction and Housing Minister Binyamin  Ben-Eli'ezer several weeks ago. On the map, a circle was drawn  around Jerusalem that greatly exceeded the city's municipal area  in size. The map also pictured plans for construction between  Ma'ale Adumim and Jerusalem, Ma'ale Adumim and Giv'at Ze'ev, and  also between Giv'at Ze'ev and Jerusalem.    In reaction to the demarche submitted by Amb. Brown,  government sources yesterday promised to look into the matter  and convey a response to the U.S. Government.</p>

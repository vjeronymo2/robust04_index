			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: Council leaders blame ministers for heavy losses Defeated Tory council leaders yesterday cast aside their loyalty to the Conservative leadership and blamed ministers for the party's disastrous performance in the local elections. Outgoing council leaders claimed that cabinet disunity had badly dented their local support. One said that the strong reputation of his council had been undermined by an 'appalling' campaign from Conservative Central Office, which failed to emphasise that the election should be on local issues. Mr Donald Abbott, the outgoing Tory leader of Harrow council, said Mr John Major's poor leadership was the principal reason why the Tories had lost control of the borough for the first time in 21 years. 'There is a grave danger that John Major is becoming an electoral liability,' he said. 'If you are going to be the leader, you must be seen and recognised as the leader. The prime minister should have put an end to cabinet disunity, but it is probably too late now.' Mr Ronnie Barden, whose Tory group's loss of the north London borough of Redbridge saw it pass out of Tory hands for the first time, also claimed that Mr Major's public image had been a 'hindrance'. But he blamed Mr Michael Portillo, the cabinet minister in charge of the London campaign, for making mistakes. 'Michael Portillo's original message was that it was better for the government to stay out of the London campaign,' he said. 'But then they didn't stick to that message, and ministers started to get involved. That just wasn't helpful to us.' Even in Brent, where Conservatives retained a narrow hold on the council, there was criticism of the way Tory managers had run the elections. 'There simply was no campaign from Michael Portillo or from Central Office,' said Mr Leslie Winters, who helped to mastermind the local Tory campaign. Mr Paul Cloakie, whose Tory group was resoundingly beaten by the Liberal Democrats in Kingston upon Thames, said government failure to stop overcrowding in schools had brought about his defeat. 'John Patten lost it for us in Kingston,' he said, accusing the education secretary of failing to reverse rules which allow children from neighbouring boroughs to attend Kingston's highly successful schools.</p>

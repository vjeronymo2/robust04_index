			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Observer: Elephants don't How sad that Standard Chartered, the international bank with a colourful - if at times problematic - past, cannot rejoice in a bit of history. Tucked away in the personal columns of last Saturday's Daily Telegraph is a 'BBWA Trunk Call': a call to arms, or at least drinks, to employees of the Bank of British West Africa - former emblem, the elephant. Founded 100 years ago this May by Elder Dempster shipping magnate AL Jones, it remained the leading financial institution in British West Africa throughout the colonial period before eventually being bought by Standard Bank in 1965. David Cox, who joined in 1957 in the leisurely days when duplicate bills of exchange would arrive by sea a month or so after the air-mailed originals, is hoping for around 300 guests at the shindig. Tragically, the reunion takes place in the distinctly unnostalgic Hamilton House pub by Liverpool Street station (named after Lord Hamilton, chairman of the Great Eastern Railway, with no known connection to West Africa). For there is no love lost with Standard Chartered - not a soul unconnected with the original bank has been invited, even if Cox confesses to help from the pensions department in tracing a few old-timers.</p>

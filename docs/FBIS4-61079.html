			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by unidentified correspondent -- from the </F> "Vesti" newscast]    [Text] [Announcer] The State Duma and the Russian  Government are preparing a federal law that would regulate  coverage of the activities of the state power bodies by the  state media.    [Correspondent] The draft has been prepared under the  guidance of Mikhail Poltoranin, chairman of the Duma committee  on information policy. The Duma intends to adopt the federal  law by the second half of May.    The draft of the law stipulates what kind of information  about the activities of the president, the Constitutional Court,  the government, and the parliament must be included by state  radio and television companies in their daily information  programs. A detailed list is concluded by a phrase referring to  other facts about the activity of federal bodies of state power  that could be of public interest. This means that the  obligatory list could be expanded indefinitely.    Let us have another look. Reports about the work of the  president, the parliament, the government, and its presidium  must be presented as a separate block, and only at the beginning  of a bulletin. The size of these blocks is also strictly  stipulated. Information programs are not to comment on the work  of the president, parliament, or government. Journalists are  also told when and whom they must interview at the Federal  Assembly. Not obeying the new law may be treated as a criminal  offense.    So, if the new law is adopted, state radio and television  will not be simply deprived of comments: Vesti and other  programs will contain only what all branches of state power with  their countless press services will see fit to disclose about  themselves. However, any citizen of free Russia will be able to  hear analysis and comments on decisions taken by the authorities  from programs produced by private radio and television stations,  or, as in the good old days, from Radio Freedom or the BBC. In  this case, journalists from the Russian radio and television  will have to congratulate themselves and the public with a new  victory for freedom of information in a state bureaucracy  version.</p>

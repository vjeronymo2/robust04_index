			<p>BFN       [Editorial report] The following review of the 17 May issue  of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in nature.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Lawyers Continue Protests Over Colleague's Death    2. President Sued Over Satellite Dishes    3. Gaza-Jericho Agreement Denounced    4. Islamic Group Denies Killing Copts    5. Clergymen To Testify Over Mufti's Rulings    6. Islamic Group Members To Be Arrested    7. Government Weekly Accused of Stirring Sedition    8. Liquidation of Islamic Society Denounced  <H5>  LAWYERS CONTINUE PROTESTS OVER COLLEAGUE'S DEATH </H5>   Pages one-three of the 17 May AL-SHA'B are devoted to  reports  and articles protesting the death of Lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith  Madani, allegedly by torture, while in police custody on 26  April. The collective headline reads: "Lawyers' Uprising: The  Strike is Successful and a Peaceful March to 'Abidin Palace Is  Planned Today." Under the headline, the main story notes that  the Lawyers Association is to organize a "peaceful march" on 17  May from the association building in Cairo to the Presidential  Palace in 'Abidin to protest Madani's death by torture at the  State Security Intelligence Department in al-Jizah. The report  adds that demonstrators will carry banners denouncing torture  and demanding the trial of police officers involved in torturing  Madani.    Chief Editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn, in an approximately  800-word  article on page one entitled "The People's Wrath Is the Fire  That Will Burn the Hands of Despotism," refers to the  forthcoming march and adds that Madani's "assassination" is a  crime that "must not pass." He explains that if this crime were  to be allowed to pass unnoticed and its culprits left  unpunished, more people would be murdered by torture every day.  Referring to an unspecified State Security Intelligence  statement, Husayn argues that the statement contains fresh  incriminating evidence. He explains: "At first they claimed  Madani died of low blood pressure. Then they announced that he  died of asthma; this is the first time we have heard of someone  dying of asthma. Their latest statement was tantamount to  justifying the murder. And why not, since he was the link  between the Islamic groups at home and abroad?" Claiming that  such contradictions smack of a cover-up, Husayn asks why these  charges were not announced from the start and why the forensic  report was, as he, states, hidden. Majdi concludes by saying  that confronting terrorism with torture will only result in more  terrorism and that using torture to extract information easily  will provide fertile ground for armed resistance of the  authorities.    An approximately 1,200-word unattributed report by Ashraf  Khalil on page one describes the contacts among the Lawyers  Association members and political and judicial officials over  Madani's death. Khalil notes that the "political leadership has  summoned" the association's chief, Ahmad al-Khawajah, to listen  to his argument over the case. Al-Khawajah explained that his  association strongly suspects that Madani died of torture and  submitted several demands to contain the situation and the  lawyers' anger. He demanded that the lawyers see the forensic  report on Madani's death, that the officers responsible for his  death be named, and that 35 detained lawyers be released. The  writer explains that the political and security leaders promised  to meet the demands but to release only 15 of the detained  lawyers. In return, the security leaders called on the lawyers  to be calm and refrain from staging demonstrations. But the  deal collapsed following the Interior Ministry's statement  charging Madani in a state security case.    An approximately 600-word unattributed report on pages one  and seven refers to a statement by Amnesty International  expressing concern over the death of Madani. The statement  notes that a representative of the organization met Madani  briefly on 24 April and set an appointment to meet him again the  same week. But Madani did not show up on time. The  organization later learned that he was arrested at his office on  26 April and reportedly tortured to death. The statement adds  that Madani is said to have been whipped and beaten and to have  received electric shocks in custody. Amnesty International  urged the Egyptian authorities to clear up the issue before the  public, name the people responsible for his murder, if proven,  and put them on trial.    Reports on the general strike observed by lawyers throughout  Egypt on 15 May to protest Madani's murder are detailed on pages  two and three. According to the reports, the strike was  observed unanimously in every governorate and judges sympathized  with the lawyers by postponing cases scheduled for that day. On  the same pages, correspondents Ashraf Khalil and Mu'tazz  al-Hadidi describe a news conference in Cairo at the Lawyers  Association building in which several association members spoke.  Mukhtar Nuh, secretary general of the association, revealed  that the Interior Ministry falsely accused Madani of practicing  terrorism. He added: "The interior minister, in a bid to cover  up the murder of 'Abd-al-Harith Madani, named an organization  discovered a few days earlier and accused the martyr of being a  member of that organization." The names of 34 lawyers still  held in custody are listed on page three. A statement by the  Freedoms Committee in the Lawyers Association above the list of  names promises that it will no longer tolerate the detention,  torture, or murder of any lawyers and promises to remain in open  session unless all the detainees are released unconditionally.    Muslim Brotherhood member and columnist Muhammad  'Abd-al-Quddus, in an approximately 700-word on page 12, salutes  the association members for their courageous stance in protest  of Madani's death. He contends that the Interior Ministry's  statement on Madani's death shows "shortsightedness" in picking  on asthma as the alleged cause of death instead of a "heart  attack" or a "brain stroke," which lead to immediate death in  almost every case. After explaining that the "ruling regime" is  notorious worldwide for its violation of human rights, he notes  that Madani's murder has exposed the faults of a regime in which  the "head of state enjoys almost absolute powers."    PRESIDENT SUED OVER SATELLITE DISHES    An approximately 1,500-word report by Muhammad Hilal on page  four notes that Muhammad Mahmud 'Ali Hamid, a lawyer from Upper  Egypt, has taken the president, prime minister, information  minister, and interior minister to court for being "in one way  or another" responsible for allowing the operation in Egypt of  satellite dishes, which he says take "obscene films" into  Egyptian homes. Hamid believes that the decisions permitting  the import of antennas are invalid, since they run contrary to  Article 2 of the Constitution, which stipulates that Islam is  the state's religion and that Islamic shari'ah is the primary  source of legislation, and to Article 12, which obliges society  to "observe and protect ethics," the people's "national and  moral values," and "public ethics." He says that "Arab  countries, the United States, and the Jews operate television  channels to broadcast purely sexual and homosexual movies to  undermine the heavenly religions in general and Islam in  particular." Concluding his lawsuit, Hamid explains: "It is a  matter of time before these antennas deal a poisonous blow to  society's creed, ethics, and traditions." He urges the court to  suspend the decisions allowing the operation and circulation of  these dishes and to oblige the president, prime minister, and  information and interior ministers to withdraw those dishes  already operating from Egyptian homes. The writer explains that  Hamid approached the mufti's office for a fatwa, or religious  ruling, on the dish, only to be turned down by officials there  on grounds that the issues is beyond their jurisdiction.  <H5>  GAZA-JERICHO AGREEMENT DENOUNCED </H5> Muslim Brotherhood writer Ahmad al-Malat, in an approximately  2,000-word article on page five, expresses the Muslim  Brotherhood's opinion on the "fiasco" at the ceremony in which  the Gaza-Jericho Self-Rule Agreement was signed in Cairo on 4  May. Al-Malat suggests that by signing the "deed of submission"  at the ceremony, 'Arafat thought he was giving a hand to the  "tough delivery" of the hoped-for Palestinian state, but the  truth is that the deal will produce nothing but a "self-rule  locality" housing those left of the inhabitants of the usurped  Palestine in an area not exceeding 2 percent of the lost land of  Palestine. Addressing 'Arafat, he says: "The statelet you  imagine is about to see light will be nothing but a meek lamb in  a forest guarded by Zionist wolves, who audaciously declare that  the people left in that area are nothing but cockroaches to be  squashed underfoot." After reviewing the Palestinian story from  the establishment of Israel in 1948 up to the 1967 defeat of the  Arabs by Israel, al-Malat claims that 'Arafat, that day,  "committed a fatal error and a major sin by recognizing Israel  as a sovereign state that has a right to exist on the remains of  slaughtered Palestine." He believes 'Arafat's behavior is the  result of one of two things: "idiocy or treason." Al-Malat  adds that 'Arafat has forgotten that "Palestine, including the  al-Aqsa Mosque and holy Jerusalem, represents a trust in the  hands of Muslims worldwide, not an item left to the care of the  PLO to dispose of as it pleases." He adds: "Honesty dictates  that if the PLO cannot protect this trust, it must return it to  its owners, not hand it over to the enemy of yesterday, today,  and tomorrow." He concludes by suggesting that since there is  no room in Palestine for both Palestinians and Jews, then either  the land is given back to the people evicted from it or things  remain as they are. He adds: "Thus there is no choice but to  carry arms against the aggressor and to try to restore right,  even if this takes centuries. The jihad is an inalienable  obligation binding each Muslim until right is restored and the  invaders are expelled from this dear part of the land of Islam."  <H5>  ISLAMIC GROUP DENIES KILLING COPTS </H5>   An approximately 120-word on page 7 refers to a statement  issued by the Islamic Group denying the killing of Copts in  Egypt.  <H5>  CLERGYMEN TO TESTIFY OVER MUFTI'S RULINGS </H5>   An approximately 400-word report by Sha'ban 'Abd-al-Rahman  on  page seven notes that the Cairo Court of Misdemeanors has  decided to summon al-Azhar Grand Imam Shaykh Jad-al-Haqq 'Ali  Jad-al-Haqq, other clergymen, and Islamic economic experts to  testify on Mufti Shaykh Sayyid Tantawi's fatwas on banking  transactions, the import of alcoholic drinks for non-Muslims,  and the opening of casinos for tourists. The court's decision  has come at the request of a team of lawyers defending Dr. 'Ali  al-Salusi, professor of economy at Qatar University; Dr. Sha'ban  Muhammad Isma'il, head of the Shari'ah Department at al-Azhar  University; and 'Ali Faruq, chief editor of the newspaper  AL-NUR, who have been taken to court by Mufti Tantawi on libel  charges for challenging his fatwas and calling for his dismissal  from office for passing rulings that run contrary to the Koran  and the prophet's tradition. Another court earlier sentenced  the defendants to a six-month prison term and a fine of 600  Egyptian pounds but the defendants appealed the court decision.   <H5>    ISLAMIC GROUP MEMBERS TO BE ARRESTED </H5>   'Ala' al-Bahhar, in 240 words on page 7, writes that the  security agencies plan a campaign of arrests among active  members of extremist groups in the coming two weeks.  <H5>  GOVERNMENT WEEKLY ACCUSED OF STIRRING SEDITION </H5>   An approximately 350-word report by 'Adil al-Bahnasawi on  the  same page notes that Major General Ahmad Sadiq, chief of police  in the Upper Egyptian Governorate of al-Minya, has accused a  governmental weekly magazine of inciting sedition by publishing  what he says are lies and groundless reports on the Islamic  groups in his governorate. In a statement to AL-SHA'B, Maj.  Gen. Sadiq denied reports published in the magazine about the  Islamic Group's control of al-Husayni Street in al-Minya. The  security official pointed out: "Some people belonging to the  Islamic Group rented shops next to the National Democratic Party  headquarters after obtaining legal licenses from the City  Council." Their activity has been scrutinized and found to be  legal, he added. Maj. Gen. Sadiq issued a challenge to prove  reports in the same magazine, said to be notorious for  publishing "lies" about the Islamic Group, that the Islamic  Group orders people in Mallawi, a town in al-Minya Governorate,  to pay extortion money to the group. He also denied reports  that members of the group do not permit women and men to ride on  the same public transport vehicles.  <H5>  LIQUIDATION OF ISLAMIC SOCIETY DENOUNCED </H5>   An approximately 400-word unattributed report on page 7  notes  that the Labor Party Committee in Alexandria has issued a  statement on "tragic events" in the al-Wardiyan District. The  events followed the Alexandria governor's decision to dissolve  the "Al-I'tisam Bi Habl Illah" religious society, which is based  at the Abu-'Umar Mosque in Alexandria and supervised by several  local council members from the Labor Party. The statement notes  that contrary to the people's desires, the mosque was taken over  by the Ministry of Social Affairs and a progovernment board of  directors was appointed to run the society. This, the report  adds, has angered the people in the neighborhood, who clashed  with the policemen brought to the area to expel the society's  legitimate board of directors. The statement called for the  immediate release of all local council members and citizens who  were arrested on charges of "rioting."</p>

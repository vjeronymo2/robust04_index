			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Czechoslovakia ordered three British diplomats and a businessman out of the  country in response to Britain's expulsion of four members of the Czechoslovak  Embassy in London one day earlier. The Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry on Friday  summoned Britain's ambassador in Prague and accused the four of unacceptable  behavior. Mirroring the British action, Czechoslovakia gave the four 14 days to  leave, the embassy added. Named in the expulsion order were embassy first  secretaries Rick Todd and Anthony Arnold and press secretary Patricia Holland.  Also ordered out was Nicholas Brooks, a representative of Britain's Shell Oil.  </P></p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Bosnian talks resume as Serbs pull back weapons Talks on reviving peace efforts in Bosnia will be held today in London involving the US, Britain, France and Russia following the Serbs' removal of weapons from the centre of Gorazde under threat of massive air strikes. General Sir Michael Rose, United Nations commander in Bosnia, said yesterday the Serbs had pulled their heavy armour out of a 3km exclusion zone, bringing some relief to the besieged town. The Serbs, defying international condemnation, have established a stranglehold on Gorazde in an offensive that began at the end of last month. More than 700 people have died in the 65,000-strong enclave, one of six so-called Bosnian safe havens the UN has pledged to protect. Gen Rose said the Serbs were also beginning to move equipment out of a broader 20km zone which Nato has told them to evacuate by tomorrow night. Nato and UN officials also claimed to have patched up a row that flared on Saturday after the UN turned down a proposal from the alliance to launch an air attack against the Serbs. Yesterday's lull enabled the UN to begin evacuating the wounded. UK and French helicopters began transporting more than 600 seriously injured people to Sarajevo. A convoy of 14 UN food trucks arrived in Gorazde last night, the first supplies since March 28. Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, said Nato demands for an end to shelling in Gorazde and a partial withdrawal of Serb forces had apparently been heeded. Bosnia's Moslem-led government insisted that some artillery fire was continuing. Mr Christopher said Gorazde had seen only small arms fire yesterday. 'The withdrawal was somewhat spotty, but my latest reports from the scene are that the withdrawal is taking place,' he said in a television interview. He is due in London today for talks with Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, and Mr Alain Juppe, foreign minister of France. Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's chief negotiator on former Yugoslavia, is expected to meet British diplomats separately. Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnian prime minister, said Gorazde was still a scene of fighting, as Bosnian radio reported artillery and sniper attacks. In Zagreb, Mr Yasushi Akashi, the senior UN official in former Yugoslavia, said observers could no longer see any heavy weapons inside the exclusion belt around Gorazde. The zone was a main Nato demand last week when it threatened wider use of air power. US officials confirmed they had backed Nato's request  - denied by the UN  - to begin strikes on Saturday when the Serbs failed to stop shelling, and had since made progress in gaining UN support for use of air power.

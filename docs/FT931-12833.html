			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: US stakebuilding clouds future for Wessex Water WESSEX WATER's future has simultaneously become clearer yet more murky. Yesterday's fund raising and acquisition by its joint venture waste business, Wessex Waste Management,signalled the company's determination to build a meaningful arm outside the water core, and ended speculation that it may branch out into a third area. At the same time, however, the increased shareholding in Wessex by its joint venture partner, Waste Management International, which could rise to 23 per cent in 1995, raises questions about the US company's longer-term ambitions. Both sides sought to play down the significance of the increased shareholding yesterday. Mr Nicholas Hood, chairman of Wessex Water, said: 'They've never bought into a utility before, and the business they are interested in is Wessex Waste Management, not Wessex Water'. However, some analysts point out that Wessex Water derives more than 70 per cent of operating profits from sewerage rather than water supply, suggesting WMI's intentions may be wider than Mr Hood implied. 'WMI like to have control, and eventually they will want to have control of Wessex,' one observer said. Despite these complications, yesterday's acquisition was well received. Wessex has a good reputation with the stock market, where the original 1991 deal establishing the joint venture was applauded. Because Wessex is one of the smaller of the 10 privatised water services companies, it is better placed to build up a meaningful non-core business. If regulation of the water companies becomes tougher after the 1995 interim review, as many observers expect, earnings from non-core businesses should be secure and will maintain dividend growth. Following the acquisition, WWM should generate annual turnover of more than Pounds 70m and profits before tax of at least Pounds 11m, before the benefits of cost savings, described as considerable, flow through. By 1995, WWM's contribution to Wessex group profits could have doubled from 7 per cent to 15 per cent. This would be one of the highest non-core contributions to a water company. Wessex and WMI, the international arm of Waste Management of the US, are both betting that environmental law changes which come into effect in April will benefit larger operators at the expense of 'cowboys', and improve margins. Both companies said they made the acquisition on the basis of assumed earnings growth and 'significant' additional contracted turnover. WWM will also probably have the largest war chest in the waste sector, since Wessex's Pounds 88m available for investment will be matched by WMI. Assuming sellers can be persuaded to lower their asking prices, WWM could soon emerge as market leader, especially since the acquisition takes it into the important - although low margin - area of municipal waste. As yesterday's purchase price suggested, acquisitions will not be cheap. Wessex said the Pounds 113m price tag, payable in cash on completion then in three annual installments, was good value, even though the NFC division being acquired reported operating profits of only Pounds 4.4m in the year to October 2. Wessex said the price was fair because of the amount of consented landfill and contracted turnover it is buying. However, its status as a lowly rated water stock meant some dilution was inevitable when building a highly rated waste division. NatWest Securities yesterday revised its estimates for Wessex's profits in 1993-1994, when the latest acquisition will have its first meaningful effect, from Pounds 90m to Pounds 98m. However, on a fully diluted basis, earnings per share will fall from 68p to 58p. Mr Peter Hyde, at Kleinwort Benson, said further dilution could not be ruled out. 'Their strategy is to build a waste management business, and that is going to be expensive because of the rating they are on,' he said. Part of Wessex's aim is to narrow the gap between its rating and that of the waste sector. It believes shareholders will be rewarded as the proportion of earnings from waste increases, and the company's rating begins to reflect both its water and waste operations. What may help the rating sooner, especially as the expiry of the government's special share grows closer in 1995, is speculation about WMI's intentions. Wessex could be the first water company to develop a bid premium.</p>

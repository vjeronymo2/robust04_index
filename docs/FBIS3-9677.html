			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mediha Colo report on news conference by Mirko Pejanovic, </F> president of the Serbian Civic Council, on results of 27 March  Congress of Serbian People of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- recorded]    [Text] [Colo] President of the Serbian Civic Council Mirko  Pejanovic first stressed that the reactions to the Congress of  the Serbian People in Bosnia-Herzegovina were favorable, both in  the country and abroad. He then singled out a few significant  things pertaining to the congress.    [Pejanovic] The first thing is that the congress has shown  that citizens of Serbian nationality who live on the territory  under the control of the legitimate authorities and the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army are tremendously determined to fight for  a shared life. They have exhibited this determination by  participating -- together with the democratic and civic options  from the Croatian and Muslim nations -- in the resistance and  defense of the multinational and multicultural essence of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The other thing manifested at yesterday's congress is that  the adopted declaration is founded on basic political aims that  are incorporated in the platform and work of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency. The declaration reaffirms two  principles of this platform: The principle of ethnic equality  and Bosnia-Herzegovina's unity within its internationally  recognized borders, and in this context, support for solutions  designed to resolve the Bosnian issue based on the concept of  the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Colo] This solution is considered optimal because it allows  local self-management, regional and cultural autonomy, and joint  institutions, the most important of which is the Council of  Peoples where the vital interests of each nation will be  realized, stressed Pejanovic, and continued:    [Pejanovic] The third thing I would like to stress is that  the congress of citizens of Serb nationality was held in the  spirit of efforts and demands for the establishment of peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Colo] Mr. Pejanovic then explained to correspondents that  the Congress of the Serbian People of Bosnia-Herzegovina had  proposed that deputies in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly who  are from the ranks of the Serbian people draft an amendment to  the proposed Constitution of the Bosniak Muslim and Croat  Federation.    [Pejanovic] The amendment consists of only one word. The  word Serbs should be added to the list of peoples listed in the  part of the Constitution that refers to constituent peoples.    [Colo] The Serbian Civic Council will draw up its program  for  peace initiatives and talks aimed at finding an integral  solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina. One such meeting -- with Mr.  Charles Redman -- has been set for Wednesday [30 March]. This  council, together with progressive Muslim and Croatian forces,  will contribute to the establishment of peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. We shall also request firmer international  pressure in finding a political solution with the so-called  third, Serbian side, in which the opinion of the Serbian Civic  Council will be one of the factors involved in finding this  solution, said Mirko Pejanovic, president of the Serbian Civic  Council, at today's news conference.</p>

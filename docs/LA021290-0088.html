			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE TIMES POLL;  </P> <P> NEW ARENA UNNEEDED IN O.C., 57% SAY  </P> <P> About 57% of Orange County residents say they do not believe that a new sports  arena is needed in the county, despite plans to build state-of-the art indoor  facilities in Santa Ana and Anaheim.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, according to The Times Poll, there appears to be plenty of fans  willing to attend National Basketball Assn. or National Hockey League games if  either arena is built. And those with a preference for a city overwhelmingly  prefer Anaheim to Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Despite a tradition of fiscal conservatism, nearly two-thirds of Orange County  residents either favor using public funds for a new sports arena or would  approve of taxpayer support, depending "on the circumstances."  </P> <P> Even though most people don't think a new arena is needed, chief negotiators  for the competing projects said the poll results show broad-based patronage for  the arenas they hope to build.  </P> <P> "I think it's tremendous support for what we've been saying, particularly when  that's reflected in numbers of people" rather than in percentages, said Neal  Papiano, attorney for Ogden Corp., which hopes to build a $95-million arena in  Anaheim.  </P> <P> Also upbeat was Tony Guanci, of King Guanci Development Inc. of Newport Beach,  which is working with Spectacor Management Services and MCA Entertainment to  bring a $75-million arena to Santa Ana.  </P> <P> "On the whole, I think it's a good indication that the NBA and the NHL . . .  would be supported in Orange County," Guanci said. "That's why we believe  strongly that there are teams that would like to relocate in Orange County."  </P> <P> The poll, directed by I.A. Lewis, has a margin of error of plus or minus four  points on results from Orange County, and three points for results tabulated  from Los Angeles and Orange counties.  </P> <P> Santa Ana and Anaheim each hopes to lure NBA or NHL franchises to play in their  as-yet unbuilt indoor arenas. If an arena is built, 43% of those questioned  said they would attend NBA games and 39% said they would attend NHL games.  </P> <P> In a county of 1.7 million adult residents, this means that there may be  663,000 to 731,000 adults willing to buy tickets, seemingly more than enough to  regularly fill the 20,000-seat arenas proposed in both cities.  </P> <P> "The fact that there is that much interest is very exciting," Papiano said.  "Keep in mind, you are only talking about 20,000 seats."  </P> <P> Among those polled by The Times was Terry Miller of Fullerton, who said she  probably would not attend basketball or hockey games in an Orange County arena  because she is "not a sports-minded person."  </P> <P> However, "my husband follows basketball, and I think he probably would," Miller  said. "The only reason he doesn't attend them (basketball games) right now is  he doesn't like driving that far" to Los Angeles and Inglewood, where the  area's only two NBA franchises are located.  </P> <P> The Times Poll also found that the median ticket price residents are willing to  pay to attend professional basketball and hockey games is near to the existing  price of tickets in the NBA and NHL.  </P> <P> The average price that those polled said they would be willing to pay for NBA  tickets is $19.30 and for NHL tickets $17.60. The average ticket price in the  NBA of $19.21, and the average in the NHL is $18 to $19.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, a significant number of Orange County residents, 18%, said they  would be willing to pay $21 or more to attend NBA or NHL games.  </P> <P> But there were extremely few residents who said they would be willing to  purchase season tickets to either NBA or NHL teams playing in an Orange County  arena. Only 4% of those asked said they would buy NBA season tickets and only  1% said they would buy NHL season tickets.  </P> <P> With the cities of Anaheim and Santa Ana racing to see which will build an  arena first, The Times Poll found a preference for Anaheim.  </P> <P> When asked in which city they would be more likely to attend sporting events,  22% said Anaheim, while only 7% favored Santa Ana.  </P> <P> However, 34% said they would attend events in either city. But 35% said it is  not likely that they would attend events in either city.  </P> <P> "The image that Santa Ana has had in the past is not too favorable," said Santa  Ana Councilman John Acosta, "but we're coming out of that. You're seeing all  these major developers coming back to Santa Ana."  </P> <P> Although the arenas in Anaheim and Santa Ana are to be privately built and  operated, the current proposals also call for some public funding. This concept  apparently doesn't disturb Orange County residents.  </P> <P> A 52% majority of those polled said that, depending "on the circumstances,"  they would approve of using public funds to pay for sports arenas. Of the  balance of those questioned, 32% said public funds should not be spent, while  12% said the spending of public funds would be all right with them.  </P> <P> Guanci said those conditionally supportive of using public funds would find the  Santa Ana proposal acceptable. Santa Ana's arena is expected to use property  taxes generated by the arena improvements, he said, and would not draw from the  city's general fund or affect services, such as police and fire.  </P> <P> Papiano also was encouraged by response on public funding because the Anaheim  arena "is not all going to be built with public funds." Anaheim has issued $18  million in bonds to be repaid by an increase in its motel and hotel bed tax to  acquire land for the arena.  </P> <P> PASSING ON THE RAMS  </P> <P> O.C. appears ambivalent about keeping the Rams.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION political editor] </F>   [Text] Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams today accused the  British Government of stalling, delaying and almost trying to  evaporate the thrust forward to peace in Northern Ireland.    And, in a chilling message, he placed the blame for the lack  of progress since the mid-December Downing Street declaration on  the Government for refusing to clarify its contents.    "If John Major refuses to give clarifications then it's  impossible for us to give a definitive response," he stressed.  "Unless the British Government makes that small step forward  then, I think, that Government cannot say that it is interested  in peace. That would be a terrible tragedy for the people of  this island."    The overall impression left by Mr Adams's appearance on the  London Weekend Television Walden programme was that Sinn Fein is  unlikely to accept the declaration.    And Mr Major has made it equally clear that the declaration  requires no clarification and is not negotiable.    The Government has also repeatedly challenged Mr Adams's  attempts to lay the blame at the door of the Government, saying  all that needs to be done is for the IRA to end violence -- for  ever. Then Sinn Fein, after some three months of peace, would  be considered for inclusion as a constitutional Northern Ireland  political party in the talks on the future of the province.    In a bleak warning today, however, Mr Adams said there would  be conflict if the British Government continued to behave "in  the way that we have had in the past."    Mr Adams, whose words were reproduced by an actor's voice,  said: "We have asked the British Government to clarify to our  party and to those we represent the same clarification and  elaborations they have given to every other party. The British  Government have stalled and delayed and refused to do that. So  it is impossible for us to give a definitive answer to that  Declaration when we don't have all the information about it."    Mr Adams described the Declaration as "a masterpiece of  ambiguity, about which both governments have different  interpretations." And he accused the British Government of  having "stalled, delayed and almost, if you like, are trying to  evaporate the thrust forward for peace."    Mr Adams said there would be a massive dividend for the  British people if peace was restored. "It is British money  which is being pumped in here, it's British reputations being  tarnished in a whole range of international tribunals, in human  rights bodies. The British people have to realise that there is  a unique opportunity for peace at this time and that the  Republicans seek to engage with their Government and the  Government is refusing to engage with us."    Mr Adams said the opportunity for peace was there before and  after the Declaration. "Are we going to allow the London  Government to squander this opportunity for peace?"    All the evidence suggested the British Government did not  want to join the persuaders, he said. "There is the exclusion  order against me, the insulting language used by Mr Major, his  own difficulties within his own party and his own right wing;  all indicate that at this time the British Government may not  want to join the persuaders."    So, he said, the Government had to be pressed to go the  extra  mile. He claimed: "I am not trying to put the onus on the  British Government. I am trying to get it to fulfil its  responsibility in these issues."</p>

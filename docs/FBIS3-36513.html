According to an opinion poll conducted by the sociological  service of the Georgian agency BS-Press, a total of 91% of  respondents support signing the treaty, while only 4%  said they  do not. Five percent of those asked abstained from answering  the question.    A total of 73.4% of Georgians believe that the  treaty will  play an important part in the settlement of the armed conflict  in Abkhazia, while 11.9% were skeptical about that and  another  14.7% found it difficult to answer.    As many as 59% of those asked believe that deploying  Russian  troops in Georgia on Russian conditions (3 military bases in the  republic) is in Georgia's interests, while 19.2% are  categorically against the deployment. Another 21.8% said  they  were too incompetent in such issues to provide any answer.    During the poll, 10 out of 500 said this was the first that  they had heard that Yeltsin had visited Georgia.</p>

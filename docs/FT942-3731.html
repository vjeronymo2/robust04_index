			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Energy treaty talks succeed Negotiations on a treaty to open up the former Soviet energy sector to western business have proved successful, EU officials said yesterday. The main aim is to provide better investment protection. The treaty gives legal force to the political declaration signed by heads of government three years ago. The agreement follows several months of argument over how far CIS countries would be prepared to guarantee equal treatment for western and national companies wanting to invest in their energy sector. The text of the treaty will next be submitted to governments for approval, with a view to signing it in September or October. Emma Tucker, Brussels</p>

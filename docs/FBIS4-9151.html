			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] A meeting between Romanian President  Mr. Ion Iliescu, PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat, and Israeli Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres took place at Cotroceni Palace. The  meeting concluded a short while ago.    Before that, another meeting took place at noon between PLO  Leader Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres.  According to ROMPRES, the head of the Israeli diplomacy said the  following, at the end of the meeting: The negotiations are not  yet over. For the time being, there is nothing to announce yet.  Asked whether he is optimistic, Shim'on Peres said, quote: I  am always optimistic. This optimism is also shared by Yasir  'Arafat. [no reference to close of quotation as heard]    We have now received from our correspondents the statements  made by the three participants in today's talks at Cotroceni  Palace. First, the statement made by President Ion Iliescu.    [Begin Iliescu recording] We will not make any special  statements now. Another meeting will take place at 1700,  whereby Chairman 'Arafat and Mr. Peres will briefly report on  the stage of the negotiations conducted last night and this  morning and the prospects for finalizing certain positive and  concrete aspects related to the ongoing negotiations in Cairo.  I would like to point out the political significance of these  meetings and talks in Bucharest as well as the effort and  political determination of the two leaders to achieve something.  If one usually talks about courage and heroism in the military  struggle, I believe that one needs no less courage and heroism  to build peace, overcome conflicts, and struggle against the  trend of hatred and immobility accumulated over a long period of  time. I believe that this was a display of true courage from  the politicians of both Israel and the Palestinian side. What  both Chairman 'Arafat and Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and  Minister Peres are striving to achieve these days is an act of  courage, which we appreciate as such. I believe it is in the  interest of the international community to support these  realistic and brave politicians in their efforts. [end  recording]    [Announcer] Then, Mr. Yasir 'Arafat said:    [Begin 'Arafat recording, in English with superimposed  translation into Romanian] We have to thank His Excellency, the  president, for his contribution to the progress of the peace  talks, by arranging the meeting between myself and His  Excellency Mr. Shim'on Peres. We hope to enjoy your  hospitality, in Bucharest this time, to continue our talks and  negotiations, so that we can finally implement the agreements  reached last September at the White House. I repeat, we need  courageous people. Mr. Rabin and Mr. Peres are the courageous  leaders who are making this peace. We are not doing it for our  or their sake, but for all the people in the region and the  Middle East, something which will have a positive impact on the  entire world and on peace throughout the world. I am convinced  that we are at the end of this long march. Thanks to this hard  work and our feeling of duty, we will be able to finalize this  long and difficult process. [end recording]    [Announcer] Here is Shim'on Peres' statement:    [Begin Peres recording, in English with superimposed  translation into Romanian] I would like to thank Mr. 'Arafat  and Romania's president for having facilitated this meeting. It  seems that there is something in Bucharest's air that enables us  to sit down and calmly talk over the peace process. I know that  Mr. 'Arafat is leading the Palestinian people toward a new  destiny, toward something they have never had in the past. We  wish, from the bottom of our people's heart, that we will be  successful and that we will see the end of violence, terror,  death, and suffering. We hope to see the Palestinians as  neighbors, embarked upon the road of success and prosperity,  following their historical destiny. As Chairman 'Arafat said,  we are at the beginning of the end of this process and we are  trying to find a way to conclude this great historic road of the  Palestinian and Israeli peoples. This is a new relationship and  a new beginning. I would like to thank Chairman 'Arafat for the  attempt he has made, together with us, to end our difficulties.  We would also like to thank the president for his kind  hospitality. [end recording]</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Easier said than done: Robert Graham on Italy's privatisation problems In the European privatisation race, Italy is moving like a tortoise, rather than a hare. In neighbouring France, the government has been able to launch the first of its privatisations - the sale of its stake in Banque Nationale de Paris - within four months of the programme being announced. By contrast Italy's programme for the sale of state shareholdings in industry, banking and insurance, promised since July 1992, is only now beginning to be formalised amid a messy controversy over methods of divestiture. Just when plans are reaching a critical phase, Mr Paolo Savona, the industry minister, has decided to air differences with colleagues in the government of Prime Minister Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi - especially with the man due to carry out the largest asset sale, Prof Romano Prodi, the head of IRI, the state-holding company. Differences at the weekend over the way the programme is proceeding obliged Mr Ciampi to take sides. Faced with Prof Prodi's threat of resignation, he chose to slap down Mr Savona who, in turn, promptly resigned. Even though Mr Savona last night withdrew his resignation, the incident is an embarrassment for Mr Ciampi. The timing could not be more unfortunate. Details of the sale of two of IRI's large bank holdings - in Credito Italiano and Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI) - are about to be released. The two banks are pillars of Italian banking and the manner in which the disposals are handled will be a test of whether the Italian government has the will to push through a privatisation operation comparable to that of France, the UK and Spain. Superficially the privatisation dispute centres on the means rather than the ends. On the one side is Prof Prodi, backed by the prime minister, who favours a British-style approach - divestiture through a public share offering to encourage wider ownership and ensure a genuine shift of ownership to the private sector via a quoted company. The Italians call it 'the public company' route. On the other side, championed at the week-end by Mr Savona, is the 'French solution'. This envisages the creation of a core of shareholders clearly responsible for both management and corporate strategy; but which does not exclude the small shareholder. But reducing the argument to a straight-forward clash of tactics is misleading. Mr Ciampi yesterday insisted his government would approach privatisation on a pragmatic case-by-case basis. He pointed out that Credito, in which IRI holds 67 per cent, was being floated because this was the most suitable means of disposal, while Nouvo Pignone, the gas turbines subsidiary of ENI, the state oil concern, would be sold off by private tender. A decision on the latter could be announced this week. The Credito and Nuovo Pignone privatisations were announced by the government of Mr Giuliano Amato in September 1992 at the height of the currency crisis to demonstrate Italy's commitment to liberalising the economy. In the case of Credito, Merril Lynch was hired last October to find a large domestic institution or a foreign buyer to absorb part or all of IRI's holding. None could be tempted to make the right kind of offer. That forced a change of tactics by Prof Prodi last month when he opted for a public share offering, a policy backed by the government. Details are expected this week and yesterday the board met to approve a change in the bank's statutes. Thus privatisation policy, to the confusion of many, has been marked by changing ideas dictated more by circumstance than ideology. A consequence is that it would be wrong to assume the government is prepared to relinquish all forms of control in cases where it opts for a public share offering rather than a trade sale. The government has kept discretionary powers, through a decree on September 24, when floating shares in utilities, banks and insurance companies. In effect, the government can encourage the formation of a core or syndicate of friendly shareholders to protect the national interest or the perceived interests of the company being floated. Or, it could create a golden share. So what is all the fuss about? The clues lie in the murky world of politics. Powerful lobbies are at work and the old-guard politicians, no matter how discredited by scandals, are reluctant to relinquish control of the public sector after so many years treating it as a play-ground for patronage. These lobbies were, until now, well-concealed under Mr Ciampi's technocratic government, which still has the formal backing of the old Christian Democrat-led four-party coalition. But last week Prof Prodi talked of flotation through a public company as 'a once-and for-all opportunity to encourage economic pluralism' in a economy dominated by four or five big groups in the state and private sector. In response, Mr Giorgio La Malfa, a former leader of the Republican Party, said: 'Behind all the talk of privatisation, over which Prodi is the undisputed master, lies a clear desire by the left wing of the Christian Democrat Party to maintain control over the public companies.' Mr La Malfa maintains a public share offering would probably leave unclear who will actually manage the company. This, he argues, will make it all to easy for the old politically-appointed managements to retain control. In the case of the banking system, such control would give the Christian Democrats a powerful instrument to help their revival. Prof Prodi considers himself a technocrat but has also been close to some Christian Democrats. Before the Ciampi government was formed in May, he was the Christian Democrats' choice for the premiership. Now at IRI, he has considerable powers of patronage and it is no secret that Mr Gianni Locatelli, the new head of the Rai state broadcasting corporation, was his choice. The manoeuvrings are not one-sided and many would see the anti-Prodi camp as backing the ambitions of Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank, which is believed to want control of BCI. Observers say Mediobanca has nursed ambitions of creating a northern Italian financial powerhouse combining its own talents with those of BCI. Equally, the impending privatisation of BCI and Credito casts doubt over Mediobanca's future. Until now, Mediobanca's independence has been assured through a shareholding arrangement controlled by Credito, BCI and Banca di Roma - all IRIR-run financial institutions. Privatisation of BCI and Credito could upset this. The differences are not irreconcilable. The present squabble is a jockeying for position to ensure that there are gains for all those who would benefit from state sell-offs. However, this does not encourage transparency; nor does political wrangling encourage investors to move away from their safe holdings in Treasury bills to the stockmarket and riskier privatisation issues.</p>

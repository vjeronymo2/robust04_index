			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Interest deferral hits Heron shares Prices of Heron International's bonds and shares fell on Friday after Thursday night's news that bondholders would be asked for a three-month deferral of interest payments. The securities were issued as part of last September's Pounds 1.4bn restructuring. The senior bonds, which had been quoted at 68-73 per cent of par value, fell on Friday to 60-65 per cent, while junior bonds fell from 20-25 per cent to 12-17 per cent. The shares fell from 14p-19p to 8p-13p. The main cause of the proposed interest payment delay is the substantial fall in Spanish property values. The interest payments were largely dependent on the sale of some of the Heron head office division's Spanish properties. Heron, Mr Gerald Ronson's property group, also said that it would put proposals to bondholders converting a portion of the senior bonds into a new debt instrument which could convert into equity. Heron said it could no longer predict with any degree of prudence that the senior bonds would be repaid in full. Mr Ronson, whose shareholdings including his family and charitable trusts fell from 100 per cent to 5 per cent under the restructuring, is now less likely to achieve the maximum shareholding under the management incentive plan. That would have given Mr Ronson 85 per cent of a 25 per cent stake in the group if the senior and junior bonds been repaid in full by March 31 2000 and the net asset value of the group exceeded Pounds 210m at the same date.</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark up on Russian calm THE D-MARK regained some of its strength against the dollar and European currencies yesterday as dealers continued to think that events in Russia were calming down, writes James Blitz. In the last three days, President Yeltsin has regained command of the situation in Moscow, and a key military figure yesterday announced that he was defecting from the Russian congress grouping and moving to Mr Yeltsin's side. A number of worries remain. Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the respected Russian economist who has been a key figure in the reform movement, said yesterday there was a chance of a serious clash breaking out in the 'White House' parliament building in Moscow. This did little to affect dealing, and the dollar dropped 1 3/4 pfennigs to close at DM1.6310. It ended New York trading at DM1.6281. Several other factors may have helped the German currency rise against the dollar yesterday. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the retiring Bundesbank president, said in Washing-ton at the weekend that the US was pushing for lower interest rates following a spate of poor indicators. At the same time, the minutes of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meeting of August 17 revealed that the central bank had moved its stance on interest rates away from tightening, towards a neutral position. Another cut in US rates would add to the interest premium on holding D-Marks. US economic data were also dollar negative. US existing home sales for August fell 1.3 per cent to an annualised 3.81m. The market had been expecting a 0.8 per cent rise. In Europe, the D-Mark was a shade stronger against the French franc, finishing at FFr3.489. Dealers said that Thursday would be an important turning point for the 'Mark/Paris' exchange rate. The French unemployment figures for August are due out that day. Dealers are expecting a slight rise on the July unemployment rate of 11.7 per cent. A worse figure could trigger a move out of the current trading range towards FFr3.50. The French authorities are also due to operate in money markets that day. Speculation remains strong that there could be a cut in the inter-vention rate. The yen was little changed against the dollar in Europe. Dealers were waiting for the results of the Clinton/Hosokawa talks in the US afternoon before taking a firmer view on the exchange rate. However, the absence of a communique on exchange rates at the G7 summit at the weekend led dealers to think that the US was content with the recent Japanese stimulation package, and had been given assur-ances about further tax-cutting measures. The dollar ended at Y105.85 from a previous Y106.00. Sterling lost  3/4 pfennig on the day at DM2.4675. In New York the dollar closed at Y106.10.</p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Job cuts expected at Scottish Enterprise THE SCOTTISH Enterprise network of economic development bodies in southern Scotland is likely to make substantial staff cuts as a result of a reduction in its budget expected in public spending plans for next year. Mr Crawford Beveridge, chief executive of Scottish Enterprise, parent body for 13 local enterprise companies (Lecs), has told staff the network of Lecs and the parent body will both be reduced in size. The parent body, known as Scottish Enterprise National, employs about 370 people and the 13 Lecs have about 1,000 staff in all. The 1992-93 Scottish Enterprise budget totals Pounds 462.5m. Staff of Scottish Enterprise National may be cut by between 80 and 100, with about the same number of jobs being lost in the Lecs. Scottish Enterprise's budget could be reduced by 10 per cent. The possible cuts were denounced by Mr Tom Clarke, the shadow Scottish secretary, as 'short-sighted and ludicrous'. Mr Beveridge said decisions on the allocation of resources depended not just on the money available but also on 'priorities for the network as a whole' and on 'the increasing efficiency with which we carry out these tasks'. Decisions will not be taken until after next week's Autumn Statement. With government spending being tightly constrained by the Treasury, the Scottish Office industry department which funds Scottish Enterprise wants to preserve its road building programme, saying it is essential as the single European market approaches.</p>

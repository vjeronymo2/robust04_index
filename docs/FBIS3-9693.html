Surrounded by a  police cordon, angry demonstrators are demanding the removal of  President Milan Kucan and Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek. Jansa's  supporters this evening started to collect signatures for a  petition demanding that the parliament not dismiss Jansa.  Serious threats were voiced at the expense of those who see  Slovenia's future without Jansa and disagree with his political  guidelines. [passage omitted]</p>

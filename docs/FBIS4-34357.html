			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Erika Ramirez from the "National Newscast; </F> passages in quotation marks recorded]    [Text] President Violeta Chamorro was visibly optimistic  upon returning from the Fourth Ibero-American Summit in  Cartagena, Colombia. The president said she expects good news  from the negotiations with the consultative council in Paris.    President Chamorro's optimism could not be hidden. The  Ibero-American presidents decided that countries such as  Nicaragua should receive preferential and asymmetrical treatment  in the integration processes. Venezuela and Colombia agreed to  be nonregional associates of the Central American Bank of  Economic Integration, BCIE, a decision that will increase the  social investment funds available to fight poverty.    [Chamorro] "I want to tell you that Nicaragua is no longer  disregarded. It is seen as a country living in democracy, with  great joy, and with its head up high. I am proud that all of  you and all Nicaraguans are cooperating for the welfare of the  country."    The president told journalists that tomorrow she might  receive good news from the consultative group in Paris. As for  domestic topics, she talked about the criticisms that have  emerged regarding the military law.    [Chamorro] "If they want to criticize it and discuss it, let  them do it in the Assembly. That is called democracy. This  country needs a small army and police force. We do not need  the number of weapons we used to have. What for? Aren't we  burning them up already? That is how I see it. Perhaps the  next president will not want an army, but we are going to have a  small army now."    As for the list of alleged companies belonging to the Army,  she said she did not know about it but will study it tomorrow.  She also said that Nicaragua has secular education and would  not reform any constitutional article in this regard.    [Chamorro] "I am not asking anyone to attend special  classes.  If they want to attend those classes, they may do so. They  also have the right to attend church and cults if they so  desire."    The president pointed out that the National Assembly has the  duty to decide if it will approve the military code and the  constitutional reforms. She said that what she wants is mutual  respect among government branches.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The recent crisis in Indian-Pakistani relations over  the problem of Kashmir has died down with mediation by the  Islamic Republic of Iran. Some weeks ago, Pakistan called for  the issuance of a resolution on the violation of human rights by  India in Kashmir. Our correspondent Hajiparvaneh, who is in  Paris, interviewed our country's representative at the UN Human  Rights Commission on this step by the Islamic Republic of Iran.  Sirus Naseri said in relation to this:    [Begin recording] [Naseri] Many countries--Islamic and  Western countries and, as far as we know, Britain, Australia,  and others--tried to bring about an understanding between India  and Pakistan in some way or another. But three or four days ago  all of them gave up, concluding that there was no way out and  that these two countries would move toward a confrontation, and  decided to issue a resolution on Kashmir.    However, our diplomatic machinery not only did not give up  but it increased its efforts. I should say that with the  multifaceted efforts of our Foreign Ministry, directives issued  by the president himself, the direct participation of our  foreign minister, and the activities that we carried out in  Islamabad and New Delhi, at the last moment we achieved  something that all the members of the commission thought to be  impossible--Iran was able to pave the way for reconciliation  between the two countries on this issue within an extremely  logical framework.    The result was, I think, also a victory for Pakistan and  India because contrary to the tension that they were moving  toward, tranquility has been suddenly established, which we hope  can pave the way for the resumption of talks between the two  countries on the resolution of their problems. This was a  success for the Kashmiri Muslims because within this framework  India allowed representatives of some Islamic countries to  inspect the area to see the actual situation; if they observe  that Muslims are in need of something or that human rights are  being violated, they will discuss this with the Indian  Government so that the situation will improve.    I think that this was an extremely significant issue for  Iran  because of the credibility it was able to gain by being able to  complete an extremely difficult political task that all the  others who are so boastful about their abilities were unable to  do anything about and gave up. Probably an extremely  outstanding outcome of this development is that everything  worked contrary to the opinion of the Westerners, especially the  United States, which very flagrantly announced a couple of days  ago that the commission's attention should be focused on Iraq  and especially Iran, and whose hostile policies toward Iran have  been extremely obvious, especially during the past few years.  And exactly on the same day that they exerted all their efforts  to issue a resolution against us, Iran emerged as probably the  most popular and most outstanding member of the commission.    [Hajiparvaneh] Our country's permanent ambassador at the  European headquarters of the United Nations talked about the  resolution on human rights in Iran, which the Commission issued  under pressure by Western countries: The approval of such  resolutions is customary and has assumed such a political nature  that it is no longer attractive to anyone and is only a pretext  for the West's propaganda against Iran. He added: More  realistic countries are well aware of the depth of such actions  and are aware of how hostility and spite by the West, especially  the United States, are involved in such actions; out of the 52  members of the UN Human Rights Commission, 30 of them either  abstained or voted against this resolution.

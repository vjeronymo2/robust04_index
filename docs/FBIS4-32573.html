			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by editor Tomas Sulak on the second regular congress </F> of the Christian Social Union in Moravia on 25 June--recorded]    [Text] [Sulak] The Christian Social Union [KSU], formed by  the opposition to the leadership of the Christian Democratic  Union-Czechoslovakia People's Party [KDU-CSL], headed by Josef  Lux, held a congress today. The participants are in favor of  following the spirit of the prewar Czechoslovak People's Party  headed by Jan Sramek.    Milos Hanak, former member of the People's Party and the  current chairman of the Vyskov, Moravia District privatization  commission, was elected the new chairman of the party. Four new  deputy chairmen and a new central committee of the party were  also elected. The congress stripped former party Chairman  Frantisek Michalek of all party posts.    According to its new chairman, Hanak, the KSU is currently  operating within the framework of the so-called Realistic Bloc,  considers itself to be a party of the center, and does not  consider itself to be a regional party. On the contrary, it  will attempt to address citizens of the whole Czech Republic.  The party is based on the principle of Christian humanism,  which is being perceived as an alternative to both dogmatic  collectivism and unrestrained liberalism. It also emphasizes  the social aspect of political life, and its political priority  is to renew land-based administration [zemske zrizeni] in  Moravia.</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Credit institutions cool on role in funding PSBR BANKS and building societies are unlikely to play a central role in helping to fund the UK's growing public sector borrowing requirement, a Bank of England official said yesterday. His comments came as UK credit institutions remained lukewarm about a change announced in Tuesday's budget - that gilt sales to banks and building societies would count towards the funding of the borrowing requirement in future. The institutions said that current conditions made it extremely unlikely they would become substantial buyers of gilts. The Bank official said: 'We're not thinking of angling gilts at them. What we'll do is sell gilts to all-comers and, if they want to buy them, fine.' He added, though, that there were likely to be issues of shorter-dated gilts over the coming year which would prove more attractive to banks. 'I would envisage that there would be some short-dated debt of five years or even four years. That averages out the cost.' The official said that the Pounds 5.5bn of gilts sold to banks in the 11 months to February this year could be counted as funding in any of the next two or three years, should there been any need to 'top-up' the funding in the future. This buffer, together with the Pounds 3bn due already next year on partly-paid stock and the change in the funding rule, meant that the Bank had a head-start on reaching next year's target of Pounds 50bn, the official added. The chancellor announced on Tuesday that gilts sold to banks and building societies would count towards funding, but that there would not be a move to 'under-funding'. This meant that it was very unlikely that there would be sales of short-dated instruments, such as Treasury bills, to fund the PSBR, the Bank official said. Speaking after the budget, Mr Roger Little, director in charge of dealing at Abbey National, said: 'It doesn't give us any more incentive to buy gilts than before.' Others said that they were unlikely to buy longer-dated gilts. 'I cannot believe the Bank wants to force banks to buy the sort of long-term gilts which they believe are unacceptably risky,' said Mr Peter Wood, finance director of Barclays Bank. The shape of the UK yield curve - five-year yields are only just above money-market rates - also removes the attraction for banks of moving further down the yield curve. Mr Richard Goeltz, chief financial officer of National Westminster Bank, said British banks would require a more attractive yield on two- or three-year bills if they were to start increasing increase their portfolios substantially. He said the Budget had contained 'nothing that would lead us to start building a portfolio of gilts tomorrow'. He added that the bank would have to be more confident of yields on medium-term gilts to start taking the capital risk. A wider differential in the US bond market between money-market interest rates and short-term bond yields encouraged US banks to take their holdings of government bonds up to nearly Dollars 700bn at the end of 1992, from about Dollars 450bn two years before. This has helped both to fund the government borrowing requirement and guarantee the banks a healthy profit to rebuild their depleted capital resources. The Bank met gilt-edged marketmakers on Wednesday evening to discuss its plan to switch to a monthly auction for 1993/94 while retaining considerable flexibility in its funding policy. Representatives of the marketmakers who attended the meeting said that they were generally content with the Bank's approach, although there remained calls in some quarters for a switch to larger and less regular auctions or a fixed auction calendar.</p>

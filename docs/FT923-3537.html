			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Computer wears dark glasses Just as commuters habitually find something more interesting in their fellow-passengers' newspapers than their own, workers in open plan offices often find it hard to resist stealing a glance at their colleagues' computer screens. But help is at hand for those who handle confidential or proprietary information, or workers in open plan or public areas, who cherish their privacy. A new screen filter from 3M is claimed to be the first to combine privacy, glare reduction and radiation protection. The 3M Privacy Plus Filter allows only an operator seated in front of a computer screen to see the information displayed. The privacy protection feature uses 3M 'microlouvre' film, containing microscopic louvres which make the screen look dark when viewed from the side. The filter, along with three others offering combinations of the three features, is made of glass, with a simple 'squeeze' adjustment to custom-fit them to the monitor. They will be sold initially through accessory catalogues. Action Computer Supplies: UK, 0800 333333; Orion Media Marketing: UK, 081 847 4141; The Little Red Book: UK, 0800 521375.</p>

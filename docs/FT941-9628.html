			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Business Travel (Travel Update): Near normality Transport hubs in the north eastern US returned to near normal yesterday after days of struggle caused by the worst snow storm in more than a decade. Freezing drizzle and light snow were reported in a wide area from Baltimore to Boston in the early hours of Sunday, but there no hint of any repeat of Friday's knockout punch that paralysed the region with a foot to 18 inches of snow. All main airports were open, and trains and buses were running on time. Both Kennedy and Newark airports reopened after being closed most of Friday. Spokesmen for big US airlines said that, weather permitting, they hoped those airports as well as Laguardia would be operating normally.</p>

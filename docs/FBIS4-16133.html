			<p>BFN     [Text] VILNIUS, Apr 13, BNS - The Lithuanian parliament on  Tuesday [12 April] passed several amendments to the temporary  law on the individual income tax, which was reduced to 33  percent.    The amendments were adopted as a counterbalance to the  value-added tax that comes into effect May 1. Experts suppose  that the individual income tax will drop by an average of 7 to 8  lits, while annual budget receipts should decrease by around  100,000 lits. Smaller income taxes should compensate for the  price-leap that is expected after the value-added tax is  introduced. Prices are expected to jump by around 6 to 10  percent.    The amended law provides not only for the reduction of the  individual income tax, but also for a higher nontaxable income  minimum. The amendments are temporary because a law on the  general income tax has already been submitted to the parliament  for consideration. The new tax will presumably come into effect  next year.    On Tuesday, the parliament also fully approved the law on  excises. The lawmakers changed their earlier decision not to  impose excises on coffee and electricity.</p>

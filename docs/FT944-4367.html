			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: SA group sells 80% stake in catering arm to consortium Tongaat-Hulett, the South African food and industrial group, has sold an 80 per cent stake in Supervision Food Services, its catering arm, to a consortium of black investors for R53m (Dollars 13m). Mr Cedric Savage, Tongaat-Hulett chairman, said in Johannesburg yesterday that the company had felt for some time that SFS did not fit into Tongaat's current focus on branded products, and thus it was an ideal operation to spin off as a new initiative in black business development. 'The move is a major step in the group's black economic empowerment programme, which is to facilitate participation of black entrepreneurs and managers in businesses complementary to our core activities,' he said. The new investors comprise the Kagiso Trust Investment Company, the business arm of the Kagiso Trust, a non-profit body that helps finance urban and rural development schemes, Khulani Holdings, a private black company, FirstCorp Capital Investors, the investment arm of merchant bankers FirstCorp, and Supervision's senior management, each of which have taken 20 per cent in the company. Mr Eric Molobi, the Trust's executive director, will be chairman of SPS, which will be renamed Kagiso Khulani Supervision Food Services, while existing management will be kept in place. SFS has long been one of South Africa's largest catering companies and has 5,000 employees and a turnover of R320m.</p>

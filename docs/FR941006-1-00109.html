			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Treatment for an iron overdose frequently includes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parenteral administration of deferoxamine (also referred to as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> desferrioxamine), a drug which chelates (i.e., binds) iron in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intracellular fluid and causes its excretion in urine (Ref. 6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given that 1 g deferoxamine can bind 93 mg of iron, and that, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> avoid hypotension, infusion is generally recommended at 15  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mg/kg/hr, there is a limit to the amount of iron deferoxamine can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bind. For example, safe administration of deferoxamine to a 10  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kg child over a 24 hr period is capable of binding only 324 mg of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron (Refs. 11 and 12).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Therefore, if very high levels of iron are absorbed, even  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prompt treatment with deferoxamine or another agent may not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevent a fatal outcome if chelation at the maximum safe rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cannot reduce the iron burden to levels below those that cause  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> death.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Speed of diagnosis and therapy are important. With earlier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and more effective treatment, the mortality rate from iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poisoning has been reduced from as high as 45 percent to about 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent (Ref. 9).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Summary of Information on Pediatric Deaths and Injuries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Citizen Petitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Data have been submitted to or obtained by FDA on reports of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deaths attributable to accidental pediatric iron poisoning that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were made between 1983 and 1993 to the American Association of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Poison Control Centers and between 1986 and 1993 to CPSC (Table  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1). Although these two sets of data are not identical, they do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have extensive overlap (cases included in both databases). They  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both point to an increase in reported fatalities from accidental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron poisonings of children in the early 1990's.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The number or rate of fatalities does not represent the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> totality of the health hazard, however. Data obtained by FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> show that from 1986 through 1992 there were nearly 63,000 reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to poison control centers involving ingestion of adult iron-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing products, with over 47,000 of these reports involving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> children under 6 years of age (Refs. 14 through 20). Many of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these victims required hospitalization, and many others required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some medical treatment. For example, Table 2 shows that over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1,500 of these cases were classified as having ``moderate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outcomes,'' i.e., the patient had symptoms that, while not life  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threatening, usually required some form of treatment. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hundred fifty-nine cases were classified as ``major outcomes,''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i.e., they were life threatening or resulted in permanent injury.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Except for 1992, AAPCC data do not indicate how many of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> moderate and major outcomes involved children under 6 years of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> age. However, for 1992, 55 percent (17/31) of the major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outcomes, and 51 percent (141/278) of the moderate outcomes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involved children under 6 years of age.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

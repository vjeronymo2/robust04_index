			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of exclusive interview with Turkish Cypriot leader </F> Rauf Denktas by KIBRIS correspondent Basaran Duzgun in Nicosia;  date not given]    [Text] [Duzgun] Mr. President, can you comment on the  method that will be applied in the talks?    [Denktas] It will be the same. They [UN officials] will go  and come back and the UN secretary general will submit a new  report at the end of the month. Meanwhile, the contacts will be  maintained.    [Duzgun] Can the fact that a deadline has been established  be  regarded as pressure?    [Denktas] Yes, it is so.    [Duzgun] The UN secretary general's report included a  statement by Glavkos Kliridhis. He said: "I will agree if  Denktas agrees." Does the inclusion of that statement in the  report indicate that the UN secretary general has agreed to it?    [Denktas] We have been explaining for a long time that  Kliridhis' statement should not be taken to mean that the Greek  Cypriot side has agreed. However, the UN officials have failed  to realize that.    [Duzgun] Can you comment on what may take place in the  indirect talks when they are resumed?    [Denktas] Well, let us wait until the talks are resumed...  However, let us consider the existence of a document that has  been accepted by one of the two sides but not by the other. The  other side has raised objections. Asking the two sides to  regard that document as a basis for an agreement will be  tantamount to telling one of them that "you do not have to reach  an agreement because pressure will be directed toward the  Turkish Cypriots." That is the wrong approach. Therefore, why  should the Greek Cypriot side change its position after reading  the UN secretary general's report? We are confronted with a  significant problem, which has been created by the UN secretary  general's report.    [Duzgun] Will the documents, which have been described as  nondocuments, be withdrawn in the new round of talks?    [Denktas] Documents are not withdrawn. They form the basis  of the process.    [Duzgun] Considering the fact that the nondocument has been  included in the UN secretary general's report, has it not become  an official document?    [Denktas] We do not believe that it can be characterized as  official. Of course, the UN Security Council may decide to  accept it. However, the UN Security Council cannot close its  eyes and accept a document over which the two sides have raised  objections. In fact, it must not do so because nothing can be  resolved through that approach.    [Duzgun] Will pressure be directed toward the Turkish  Cypriot  side again? Will that not create a new impasse?    [Denktas] They said that they will return to hold talks. We  have asked for certain rights. Maybe they will move to give a  tangible form to them. That is the way to hold talks. They are  well aware of what has caused the deadlock. There is nothing  concrete. They have only made promises. Let us wait to see  which countries we will be allowed to visit with our passports.  The UN administrator cannot assume responsibility for customs.  That can never be. Let us see if they will exclude that from  the document. Otherwise, I will not be authorized by the Turkish  Cypriot Republican Assembly to do anything. The Turkish Cypriot  side's right to have its own customs procedures cannot be  transferred to the UN administrator.    [Duzgun] Is there a problem with matters related to the  airline companies that will be allowed to use the Nicosia  International Airport?    [Denktas] They have said that only one airline company will  be able to use that airport. However, it was said at the  beginning that the airline companies registered in Turkey would  be able to use it. Cyprus Airways would not be allowed to use  that airport. However, we have been informed that it will be  able to do so. The UN administration cannot tell Cyprus Airways  not to use this or that flight path. All that means that the  national airline company of the Greek Cypriot side, which poses  as the Cyprus Government, will be able to use the Nicosia  International Airport and the Turkish Cypriots, who have been  living under an embargo for many years, will be able to benefit  from a number of rights that will be accorded them by the UN  administrator out of kindness and pity. What kind of an  approach is that? Kliridhis said at the beginning that neither  Cyprus Airways nor any Turkish company registered in Cyprus  should use that airport. He also said that foreign airline  companies registered in Turkey will be able to do so.  Apparently, they have changed that now.    [Duzgun] Have you insisted that Cyprus Airways register in  Athens?    [Denktas] They have changed matters related to the use of  the  airport. So they should also change that. They should have  that airline company registered in Athens and then come to talk  with us under equal conditions. The Greek Cypriot side is  trying to have what it refers to as the Cyprus Government  establish a foothold in the Nicosia International Airport.    [Duzgun] Can the problem on Maras [Varosha] be solved by  constructing a new access road?    [Denktas] No, a new road will not solve the problem because  it will have to cross through territory we control.    [Duzgun] Can you explain the problem on Maras?    [Denktas] We have been informed that we should hand over an  area as large as Maras itself and withdraw our troops. A UN  official convinced us to abandon our policy on the northern part  of Dhimokratias Avenue by assuring us that the access road to  Maras will remain under our control and that they will not ask  us to transfer it.    [Duzgun] Who convinced you?    [Denktas] Butrus Butrus-Ghali.    [Duzgun] Was he the official you referred to?    [Denktas] Yes, it was Butrus-Ghali. He said: Why are you  worried about security? You will control the entry and exit  points. Do not worry. You will not be able to convince anyone.    Considering that, we agreed to relinquish our position on  Dhimokratias Avenue. As soon as we did so, he issued a new  report and the UN officials began to say that "the transfer of  Maras will be meaningless if the Turkish Cypriot side retains  its control of the access road."    [Duzgun] A problem has emerged on the customs procedures in  Nicosia International Airport. Has a similar problem emerged in  Maras?    [Denktas] Of course a problem has emerged on custom  procedures. A problem has also emerged on the access road to  Maras. A place was to be given to the Turkish Cypriots. A  proposal was made for the establishment of something like an  open market. The UN secretary general has said that he may help  the Turkish Cypriots in leasing procedures. Well, let him first  include the promises he made to us in his report.    [Duzgun] Can you comment on the public property in Maras?    [Denktas] They have said that the property belongs to the  Cyprus Republic and that the Cyprus Government will resolve that  matter. That cannot be.    [Duzgun] Does a problem exist on deadlines?    [Denktas] We were informed that we should place Maras under  UN jurisdiction two months after the conclusion of an agreement  on the matter. Nicosia International Airport will be placed  under UN jurisdiction two months later. However, that will be  four months after the agreement is reached. The Greek Cypriots  will resettle in Maras during that time. We will benefit from  the airport 12 months later. And the way we shall do so is  unknown. No one will be able to evict the Greek Cypriots from  Maras if the Greek Cypriot Administration creates discord at the  end of the 12 months. What will happen to us then? Whether or  not you benefit from the airport after 12 months makes no  difference. The promises will not be fulfilled. We have  proposed that we transfer the northern part of Dhimokratias  Avenue after we establish ourselves in the airport. We will at  least have something in our hands.</p>

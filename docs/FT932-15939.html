			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / People: Conway moves to top of DEC from IBM The search for a replacement for Geoff Shingles, Britain's longest serving computer boss, is over. Digital Equipment, the US minicomputer maker and computing services company, has announced that the top slot in its UK subsidiary would be filled by Chris Conway, a 48-year-old battle-hardened computer industry veteran. His first task will be to ensure the company is in shape for a worldwide reorganisation due for completion by July 1 this year. Conway seems to relish the challenge: 'I think I can bring a sense of urgency to Digital,' he says. 'In my view there should be less debate and more implementation.' Strong words for an executive steeped for the past 27 years in the corporate culture of International Business Machines, a company whose current troubles are widely ascribed to a reluctance to take tough decisions quickly enough. Conway's management record is impressive, however; a specialist in the finance industry and systems integration, he led the IBM team which won prime contractor role on the Royal Navy's Merlin EH101 helicopter. Born in what was then Southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, he has lived in the UK since 1969 with a spell in Paris managing IBM's Nordic territories. Leaving IBM was an enormous wrench, he says, but Digital, once Big Blue's arch enemy, represented 'a lifetime opportunity'. Geoff Shingles stays on as chairman with a mission to raise the company profile and help with sales to government.</p>

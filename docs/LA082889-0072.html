			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHARLES KNAPP AGAIN THE CENTER OF CONTROVERSY;  </P> <P> HIS MORTGAGE FIRM'S STATUS IS A MATTER OF DISPUTE AFTER CLOSURE OF WEST L.A.  OFFICE  </P> <P> Charles W. Knapp -- the controversial Los Angeles financier who once headed  Financial Corp. of America, the nation's largest savings and loan -- had big  plans in mind when he formed Trafalgar Mortgage a couple of years ago.  </P> <P> Under the leadership of Lawrence Taggart, a former top California banking  regulator, Trafalgar Mortgage was supposed to become a nationwide mortgage  lender within three years through the acquisition of up to 200 small companies.  </P> <P> "Charlie wants to be one of the most substantial lenders in the country,"  Taggart said in an interview in May, 1988.  </P> <P> Today, Taggart is gone and, according to interviews with several former  employees, Trafalgar Mortgage is in chaos. Three of its four offices, all in  Southern California, have been closed, leaving only a small staff in the Santa  Ana office.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Nothing Got Paid'  </P> <P> The firm recently closed an office in West Los Angeles at Wilshire Boulevard  and Bundy Drive. Employees said in interviews that the office was as much as  $96,000 in arrears on its $26,000-a-month rent and that the staff had not been  paid in several weeks. The office opened only three months ago.  </P> <P> "Nothing ever got paid," said one disgusted former employee. "It was a horrible  experience."  </P> <P> Although Knapp would not comment directly on the troubles, his spokesmen  sharply disputed contentions that Trafalgar Mortgage is in trouble.  </P> <P> "The company is doing great," said attorney Terry Christensen, who said the  firm earned $1.2 million in the first six months of 1989 and should make $2.5  million before the year is over. (Trafalgar Mortgage and two subsidiary  companies had a net worth of $1.72 million as of Sept. 30, 1988, according to  company financial statements.)  </P> <P> Howard A. Siegel, acting head of Trafalgar Mortgage, said the West Los Angeles  office was closed because the managers were out of control, hiring people and  spending money without authorization. It was "a rogue operation," Siegel said.  </P> <P> Trafalgar Mortgage's woes have cropped up almost five years to the day after  savings and loan regulators forced Knapp to resign as chief executive of  Financial Corp. of America, which was a publicly traded financial institution  that owned American Savings &amp; Loan in Stockton.  </P> <P> Knapp, now 54, resigned amid a crisis of confidence that did not end until  American Savings lost nearly $7 billion in deposits. FCA ultimately went  bankrupt after American Savings failed because of heavy losses on real estate  development loans made when Knapp was in charge.  </P> <P> After a quiet period that lasted only a few months, Knapp returned to the  limelight with the announcement that he was forming a company known as  Trafalgar Holdings as a private investment banking firm. The company chose tony  office digs in Westwood as its headquarters.  </P> <P> In recent years, Knapp has been dogged by controversial business deals, ranging  from an unsuccessful effort to take over a Japanese ball-bearing company to a  soured Texas real estate development deal that has been ensnarled in  litigation.  </P> <P> Knapp has also been sharply criticized, privately and publicly, by former  partners and associates who question his business methods. "Let's just say that  I'm not sorry that I left the company," said Mark S. Dodge, former general  counsel at Trafalgar and FCA, who parted ways with Knapp in November, 1987.  </P> <P> Knapp's private life has been bumpy as well. Records in Los Angeles County  Superior Court indicate that, as of last February, he was $187,500 behind in  support payments to his ex-wife, Brooke Knapp, a well-known aviator who set a  world speed record for business jets in 1983.  </P> <P> Plans  </P> <P> Brooke Knapp declined to comment for this story, while Christensen, Knapp's  attorney, said there is a continuing dispute over how large the payments should  be. Knapp is now married to a movie actress named Lois Hamilton.  </P> <P> Trafalgar Mortgage, operating as a subsidiary of Trafalgar Holdings, appears to  have been ill-starred from the outset. Its grandiose plans have been undercut  by a shortage of capital, unfavorable market conditions and turmoil in the  ranks of management, former employees say.  </P> <P> It was supposed to fund mortgage loans, then sell the loans in the secondary  market, where they would be packaged and sold to investors as mortgage-backed  securities.  </P> <P> According to Taggart, an early effort to provide capital for Trafalgar Mortgage  with a $15-million private placement of stock unraveled after the stock market  crashed in October, 1987. "The timing just wasn't right," Taggart said.  </P> <P> Taggart also said Trafalgar Mortgage suffered from rising interest rates, which  hurt business last year, and by the death of trouble-shooter Robert Ciani, a  mortgage securities and banking expert hired early this year to help Taggart  run the company. Ciani died recently after suffering from a brain tumor.  </P> <P> Taggart quit in late April, having tired of the daily commutes that took him  from his home in San Diego to Trafalgar offices in Santa Ana and West Los  Angeles. "I was driving five to six hours a day," said Taggart, who was  commissioner for the California Department of Savings and Loan in 1983 and  1984.  </P> <P> In the mortgage lending operations at the Wilshire-Bundy office, employees were  bitter because they said they were misled by false promises and were not paid  on time.  </P> <P> "They told us they were an up-and-going operation," Steven Schleppey, who was  office manager of the West Los Angeles operation, said in an interview last  week. "I was told later they had not funded a loan in four months."  </P> <P> One employee, loan underwriter David C. (Clay) Finley, complained to the state  labor commissioner that he had not been paid for about six weeks starting in  mid-June. According to his complaint, he was owed $3,000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rocky Start  </P> <P> The West Los Angeles operation was originally supposed to be a partnership  between Knapp, who would pay the expenses of the business, and John D. Richter,  who used to work for Knapp at American Savings as a district sales manager. It  was Richter's job to hire the sales staff and generate the business.  </P> <P> The offices were housed in ample space on the 10th floor of the Wilshire-Bundy  building that had been an office of Trafalgar Securities, which had cut back  its operations.  </P> <P> According to Schleppey, the Wilshire-Bundy operation went poorly from the  start. Bills went unpaid, supplies were impossible to get and, sources told The  Times, Richter and Knapp disagreed heatedly about how the operations should be  funded and organized. Richter declined to be interviewed for this story.  </P> <P> Knapp reportedly told Richter and Schleppey that he did not want to make a  major investment in Trafalgar Mortgage because he had sustained heavy losses at  Trafalgar Securities. According to Schleppey, Knapp said he had lost $4 million  on those operations.  </P> <P> Christensen, Knapp's attorney, characterized the Los Angeles operations of  Trafalgar Mortgage as a "short-term experiment" that did not work out because  Richter and his staff generated no new business.  </P> <P> "These are guys that in three months never booked one loan," said Christensen,  a partner in the Century City law firm of Christensen, White, Miller, Fink  &amp; Jacobs. He added that all the salaried employees were eventually paid.  </P> <P> The frustration climaxed in mid-August when the entire Los Angeles staff of  Trafalgar Mortgage picked up and moved to new offices in Beverly Hills, where  the employees are operating as an affiliate of a San Jose-based mortgage  company.  </P> <P> Knapp, meanwhile, closed the offices and had the locks changed. The space  remains vacant, though the Trafalgar name remains on the door.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Honolulu, March 19 (XINHUA) -- Finance ministers  from Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) nations opened a  meeting here today to discuss how to continue economic growth  and increase outside investment in the Asia-Pacific region.    The ministers hope the discussions will help address some of  the challenges facing the region, including ensuring  non-inflationary regional growth and financing investment and  infrastructure development.    The meeting is held in accordance with the vision statement  issued on November 20, 1993, in Seattle, when the APEC  leadership conference was held.    In an opening statement to the meeting today, U.S. Secretary  of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen said that the meeting represents "the  first opportunity for regional discussions about basic issues  like economic growth and financial challenges."    "It would be hard to imagine a group of finance ministers  with more of a reason to consult. The region includes the  world's fastest-growing economies. We account for half the  world's output, half the world's foreign exchange reserves, and  nearly half the world's population.    "And trade within our region has reached 1 trillion dollars  a  year," he said.    Bentsen said, "All this growth brings with it a need for a  broadened perspective. In today's interdependent world, this  kind of economic performance cannot be sustained in a vacuum.  We all share an interest in economic strength for the region as  a whole."    He said that uneven and divergent economic performance in  the  region "creates uncertainty, uncertainty retards investment, and  investment is essential to sustained growth."    "That is why we need to consult and to cooperate in  identifying successful economic strategies for the future,"  Bentsen said.    Attending the meeting are finance ministers and their  deputies from APEC nations of Australia, Brunei, Canada, China,  Indonesia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New  Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand  and the United States.    Hong Kong and Chinese Taipei are also participating in the  meeting as regional economies while Chile, which has applied for  APEC membership, is attending as an observer.    No specific agreement was expected at today's meeting.    A draft summary of the meeting has been handed out to the  delegates. But changes are expected during discussions among  the ministers.    Also speaking at today's meeting, Indonesian Finance  Minister  Mari'e Muhammad said that "foreign capital can play a  significant role in promoting the efficiency of domestic  resources."    He said Indonesia recognizes that its resources cannot meet  all of its financial needs, particularly in the area of  infrastructure development.    Analysts say that over the next decade, Asia will need  investments totaling some one trillion U.S. dollars to develop  highways, airports, telephone lines, ports and power plants.</p>

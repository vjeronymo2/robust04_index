			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LAWNDALE AGENCY LOSES YOUTH FUNDS OVER ASBESTOS FLAP  </P> <P> The administrator of a federally funded youth employment program has decided  not to place student workers with the Lawndale Public Works Department this  summer in the wake of an asbestos-exposure controversy involving the city.  </P> <P> The decision came two weeks after Joe Maradiaga, a former part-time city  employee, told the City Council that he and other youths working for the Public  Works Department were unknowingly exposed to asbestos last summer while  cleaning up rubble left from the demolition of three city-owned buildings.  </P> <P> Public Works Director James Sanders pleaded not guilty to criminal charges for  his role in razing the buildings in violation of state and federal regulations  covering the handling of asbestos. City Manager James Arnold, who was ousted  from his post this week, also pleaded not guilty in the case.  </P> <P> "There's a lot going on with the Public Works Department and allegations, and  it did not seem to me (to be) the best environment for youth to be working in,"  said Gardena Assistant City Manager Mitch Lansdell, who administers the federal  program for Gardena and Lawndale. "When there are other work sites available  that provide good work experiences for youth, it doesn't seem appropriate to  place them" with Lawndale's Public Works Department.  </P> <P> Lansdell said Friday he decided in June not to place summer employees with the  Lawndale agency after reading newspaper accounts concerning the  asbestos-exposure case and discussing the charges with Lawndale's youth  employment coordinator.  </P> <P> The program is still paying for 35 Lawndale youth workers. About half of them  have taken jobs with other city departments and the remainder are working with  the schools and in businesses.  </P> <P> In a memo to the City Council, Sanders criticized Lansdell's decision, saying  the work the youths did in his department should not be lost because of  complaints from one disgruntled teen-ager.  </P> <P> Maradiaga was employed with the summer youth program in June, 1989, when he was  asked to help clean up the demolition site. He said recently that he and the  other youths were never told there was asbestos at the site and were not  ordered to wear any special clothing, as required by federal health and safety  regulations.  </P> <P> Maradiaga, who was hired as a regular part-time employee a few months after the  summer program ended, said he didn't learn that the razed buildings contained  asbestos until this April. He said in an interview that he was fired by Sanders  for making copies of a city-commissioned lab report on the asbestos case.  </P> <P> Maradiaga's allegations are under investigation by the district attorney's  office, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Anthony Patchett, who is prosecuting Sanders  and Arnold for the alleged asbestos disposal violations.  </P> <P> Sanders declined to be interviewed about Maradiaga's allegations.  </P> <P> Arnold's attorney, Patricia Friedel, has said there were legitimate reasons for  Maradiaga's firing that are "unrelated to the copying incident."  </P> <P> In Sanders' memo to the City Council, which was made public Thursday night,  Sanders said Maradiaga "is trying to get even by making trouble."  </P> <P> Maradiaga had worked on the demolition site 10 days after asbestos "was first  observed" there, and youth workers were used "in the final stage of the project  to pick up small chunks of concrete and black top which were too small or  scattered to be picked up mechanically," according to the memo.  </P> <P> Sanders also wrote that Lansdell should have consulted with the city manager  before making his decision to bar youth workers from taking jobs with the  Public Works Department. He also recommended that the council consider  administering its own program.  </P> <P> "It seems irresponsible to make such an important decision on a significant  benefit to Lawndale based on misinformation from a disgruntled, former,  part-time, 19-year-old employee," Sanders wrote.  </P> <P> Mayor Harold Hofmann said Thursday that Lansdell had "an obligation to let us  know they were going to cut us off" and that the program's administrator "just  overstepped (his) bounds a little bit."  </P> <P> Councilwoman Carol Norman disagreed, saying, "When you have the welfare of  younger people to consider, are you going to allow these people to . . .  perhaps be in danger? I can fully understand why there would be a cessation of  the program" in the Public Works Department, she said.  </P> <P> A decline in federal funding has forced the program to cut back by 10 the  number of student workers in both Gardena and Lawndale, Lansdell said.  </P> <P> This summer, 17 of the 35 student workers assigned to Lawndale are working for  the city.  </P> <P> The program pays the salaries of low-income students seeking employment and  takes applications from employers who want to provide the jobs.  </P></p>

The sources said Japan will do its best to dispel  such concern among Asian nations and to gain their confidence.    Japan's occupation of many Asian countries before and during  World War II still keeps ASEAN nations nervous about the  country's military intentions.    Foreign ministers from six ASEAN member countries and their  dialogue partners agreed at a 1993 session to set up the forum  to discuss security matters in the region. Representatives from  18 countries and international organizations will attend the  forum's first session at the foreign minister level in Bangkok.    At the session, Japan will reaffirm the importance of the  U.S. presence in the region, and brief participants on its  defense policy in an effort to boost their trust and strengthen  relations with them as key partners, the sources said.    As part of efforts to dispel Asia's concern, Japan will  explain its policy of continuing to shoulder the costs for U.S.  forces in Japan, they said.    China's military modernization and concerns over North  Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons are also likely  to be taken up as topics at the forum.    ASEAN links Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,  Singapore and Thailand. Among the 18 other countries and  organizations attending the session will be the European Union,  Japan, Russia and the United States.</p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / International Company News: US media group forms Indian TV joint venture Time Warner, the US media and entertainment group, is forming a joint venture with RPG Enterprises, one of India's largest industrial houses, to set up a pan-Asian satellite-based six-channel television network in India. The entertainment-based network will cost Dollars 1bn to establish, and the joint venture will have an equity base of almost Dollars 50m. The channels will seek to cater to different Asian language groups. The companies are awaiting the approval of the government's Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) before divulging details on the project. A cabinet committee on broadcasting, headed by Mr Shankarrao Chavan, the home minister, has recommended that the Indian private sector be allowed to set up extra-terrestrial television stations. However, it does not favour the entry of foreign television companies into India. Analysts say the government is unlikely to approve the Time Warner-RPG project, the first foreign-equity proposal in the Indian electronic media, until it formulates policy on the entry of foreign media groups into India. According to some reports, Time Warner is also keen to extend its entertainment empire to India, by setting up video parlours, movie halls, fast food outlets and shopping complexes. The new project, if it is cleared, will challenge the near-monopoly of Mr Rupert Murdoch's Star TV in the region. India accounts for nearly 40 per cent of Star's 1.2bn viewers in Asia, and a host of Indian and international companies are keen to enter the growing market. Star, which has a 49.9 per cent stake in Zee, the popular Hindi language channel, and has recently bought a 49 per cent stake in United Television, a Bombay-based software company, is launching India's first pay-TV channel on October 1, to screen international films.</p>

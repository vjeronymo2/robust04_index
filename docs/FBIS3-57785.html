That  is less than 10 percent of the 337,800 troops stationed here at  the beginning of 1991.    Major General Hartmut Foertsch, the Federal Government  official in charge of the withdrawal and head of the German  liaison command for the WGT, told DDP/ADN in an interview that  the former First Strategic Echelon of the Soviet Army and the  Warsaw Pact was withdrawing from Germany "according to plan."

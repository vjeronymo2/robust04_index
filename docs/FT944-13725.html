			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Indian court clears way for Lever merger plan The Indian Supreme Court has cleared the way for Hindustan Lever, the Indian affiliate of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch combine, to acquire Tata Oil Mills Company (Tomco), a soaps and detergents manufacturer which is part of Tata, India's largest industrial grouping. The court rejected five petitions asking for special leave to challenge the merger. The main petitioner, Hindustan Lever Employees' Union, had taken the case to the Supreme Court after the Bombay High Court dismissed its plea to block the merger in May. Employees' unions of both companies challenged the merger, after workers feared they would lose their jobs. They claimed the acquisition would allow Hindustan Lever to control 90 per cent of the Indian soaps and detergents market. Hindustan Lever argued the combined output would account for only one-third of the 3m-tonnes-a-year Indian soaps and detergents market. Hindustan Lever's output is currently some 700,000 tonnes a year, while Tomco's is approximately 200,000 tonnes. Another objection concerned Hindustan Lever's proposal to sell shares to Unilever at a 'massive discount' in order to let the parent company retain a majority holding in the Indian unit. The two companies had agreed an exchange ratio of shares of the merging companies, 15 Tomco shares for two of Hindustan Lever. Hindustan Lever shares yesterday advanced Rs12.50 on the news to close in Bombay at Rs680, while Tomco advanced Rs5 to finish at Rs87.5.</p>

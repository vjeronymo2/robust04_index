			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BAEZA LANDS MORE PUNCHES IN IRVINE WIN  </P> <P> It came down to quality against quantity Monday night, and quantity won as  junior lightweight Armando Baeza scored a split-decision victory over Benny  Lopez in front of 1,180 in the main event of the monthly boxing program at the  Irvine Marriott.  </P> <P> Baeza, from Norwalk, landed punches constantly, but seldom with enough pop  behind them to hurt Lopez.  </P> <P> Lopez, from Upland, hit harder but much less often. Neither fighter was ever in  danger of being knocked down.  </P> <P> Baeza (13-3-1) won 95-94, on judge Larry Rozadilla's card, and 97-94 on judge  Pat Connolly's card. Judge Chuck Hassett gave Lopez the nod, 98-92.  </P> <P> "I felt I landed better shots every round," Baeza said through an interpreter.  "He only hurt me in the fifth, but I was fine after that."  </P> <P> Lopez had scored first-round knockouts in each of his last two fights, and  Baeza, aware of that, stayed away for most of the first two rounds. After that,  he moved in on Lopez and scored with several combinations.  </P> <P> Lopez, fighting a 10-rounder for the first time, seemed to rest for parts of  every round after the fifth, letting Baeza gain the advantage in the later  rounds. Even in the final round, Lopez (13-2) was very selective, throwing only  a few punches and none in the final 30 seconds.  </P> <P> "It was kind of eerie after the sixth," Lopez said. "I never got tired, but I  was thinking about having never gone 10 rounds before. I just never followed up  my punches. I would get to him them let him get away."  </P></p>

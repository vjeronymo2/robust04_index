			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Gentlemen: With the U.S. Secretary of State  reportedly due for another Middle East tour this month, it is  worth remembering the Middle East peacemaking role to which Bill  Clinton's administration committed itself when it came to power.  We have no doubt in our mind that the United States has  abdicated that role -- the role of evenhanded broker and full  partner. The United States cannot be unaware of the neutrality  and evenhandedness that such a role presupposes if it is to lead  to the establishment of a peace predicated on justice.    Israel, however, does not want the United States to play  such  a role. Invariably, Israel is prepared to empty any  international role of its content if it is based on the  principles of international legitimacy and justice.    No wonder top Israeli officials have advised against another  tour of the Middle East by the U.S. secretary of state. Israel  has no need for forward movement in the peace process; it wants  Washington to stay as strongly biased to its wrongheadedness and  aggression as it has been for the past half century and to  continue as its protector in international forums. Israeli  leaders are anxious for the United States to be little more than  a false witness to separate deals that impose Israel's terms on  the Arab states one by one, thereby enabling it not only to  retain Arab territory but to ensure its edge over the combined  Arabs.    We do not think the U.S. administration, the one superpower  on Earth, which has taken on the challenge of bringing peace to  this region, will acquiesce in its role being so reduced. The  United States is much too important a world power to bow to the  will of a recalcitrant party flying in the face of international  law and UN resolutions. It does not serve the interests of the  United States to let Israel have its own way and dictate its own  terms for a peace settlement in the region. U.S. interests are  best served by an egalitarian and enduring peace.    Warren Christopher, having come to the region many times, is  now fully conversant with the respective positions of the Middle  East players. He is all too aware which side wants peace and  which side is placing obstacles in its path. For peace to come  to the region, the UN resolutions -- the underpinnings of the  Madrid conference and the peace process -- must be implemented.  This is especially true, since, by the admission of their  advocates, separate deals will not produce peace. Far from  leading to peace, such an approach will only minimize its  chances.    If Mr. Christopher is coming to the region to propel the  peace process on the Syrian track forward, he needs to come up  with new ideas and clear answers to the core questions posed by  Damascus when the U.S. secretary was last here. The future of  the peace process largely depends on the kind of answers he  brings.    We do not think the U.S. administration will put its  credibility and reputation on the line and renounce its pivotal  role in the peace process. Nor do we think Washington will take  the trouble of sending its chief diplomat to the region without  giving him ideas that will make his trip worth the bother.    Peace is a noble endeavor to which Syria is dedicated;  President Clinton's administration and the whole world know this  is the case. However, Damascus is pursuing an all-encompassing  and fair peace -- the peace of the brave. This, too, is known  to Washington and the whole world to be the case.    If Israel wants this kind of peace, it knows the road  leading  there. If not, it will remain an unrealizable dream.</p>

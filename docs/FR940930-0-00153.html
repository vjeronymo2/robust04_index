			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to the analysis of the 1991 prototype heavy-duty diesel engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referenced in the NPRM, EPA has used a similar analysis to examine diesel fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects based on data presented in a study performed on a 1993 prototype Navistar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Diesel DTA 466 medium heavy-duty engine. <FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>  As had been done in the earlier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis, EPA compared federal and California diesel fuels on the basis of aromatic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent and cetane number. EPA used the specified aromatic levels of 10 percent for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California test fuel and 35 percent for federal test fuel and natural cetane numbers of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 50 and 46 for typical California and federal certification fuels, respectively. <FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>  An API  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gravity number typical of both test fuels of 36 degrees was used. The following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regression equations were developed in the study conducted on the 1993 engine for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total hydrocarbon (THC) and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 26 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Diesel Fuel Property Effects on Exhaust Emissions from a Heavy Duty Diesel Engine that Meets the 1994 Emissions Requirements, ``C.

Nikanjam, SAE Paper 930728, (2) Section 2282, Title 13, California Code of Regulations procedure for certifying diesel fuel formulations resulting in equivalent emissions reductions and (3) Cummins Engine Company and Caterpiller diesel fuel formulations for federal diesel fuel. These cetane numbers are natural cetane numbers (without cetane improver). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> THC [g/Bhp-hr] = 0.819 ^ 0.01942 * (Natural Cetane) + 0.01159 * (API)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 -->  [g/Bhp-hr] = 6.593 + 0.01183 * (SFC Aromatics %) ^ 0.02497 * (Natural Cetane) ^ 0.02365 (API)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Substituting the values selected above for percent aromatics and cetane  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> numbers into these equations, the Agency calculated a THC + NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  offset of about 9.7  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent. Applying this percent offset to the 3.5 g/Bhp-hr standard for CARB diesel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel, the Agency analysis calculated that the offset would be about 0.34 g/Bhp-hr THC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> + NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . (This analysis assumed that the offset would apply equally whether THC or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMHC was being considered; the Agency has no data to indicate that the small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methane emissions component in diesel emissions would affect the relative behavior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the engine on the two fuels).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, the Agency concludes that diesel engines certified to a 3.5 g/Bhp-hr level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on California diesel fuel would for typical engines, result in emissions of approximately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.8 g/Bhp-hr for the same engines operated on federal diesel fuel, confirming the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimate made in the NPRM. In their comments engine manufacturers quoted the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same data that EPA has used for the 1991 and 1993 prototype diesel engines, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used different assumptions for the cetane number for in-use diesel fuel. Also, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry analysis did not adjust the offset proportionally to account for the much lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions of CFVs as compared to the current engine which generated the test data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In their comments, they concluded that the offset between federal certification fuel and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California certification fuel may be more in the range of 0.55&hyph;0.66 g/Bhp-hr. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has examined the assumptions used in the industry analysis and concluded that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA analysis is a more appropriate approach for determining the expected emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offset. While this conclusion is based on data from a single engine, the 1993 engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is of the appropriate size (medium heavy-duty) from which to draw a conclusion for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this program and the study was done on a meaningful array of diesel test fuels. It is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely that if similar data were collected on other engines, somewhat different values  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the CARB/federal fuel offset might be observed. Until such a time when additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data becomes available, EPA will assume that offsets for other heavy-duty diesel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines would range on either side of the 0.34 g/bhp-hr level EPA has developed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 1993 engine. Thus, the Agency believes that its analysis reasonably accounts for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential fuel variability and that the 0.34 g/Bhp-hr value represents a reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimate for the average emissions offset between federal certification fuel and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California certification fuel. If a reduction catalyst is used as a means to reduce NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels, concerns over fuel variability diminish significantly. The CARB/federal fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offset would tend to be less because the reduction catalyst would reduce emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proportionally for both fuels. While the use of reduction catalysts may not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> universal, EPA expects that some light/medium heavy-duty engine families will use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction catalyst technology to meet the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  target level. Additional data and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis supporting the above conclusion of the offset between federal and California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diesel fuel can be found in the Summary and Analysis of Comments document for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on its analysis of the emissions offset above, EPA has set the emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard for HDD CFVs certified on federal diesel fuel at 3.8 g/Bhp-hr NMHC + NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This standard is consistent with EPA's intent that the heavy-duty clean-fuel vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards be of as close to equivalent stringency as possible to the CARB LEV  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard for similar vehicles to assure the production of an adequate number of diesel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine models for the clean fuel fleet program. Further, because the Agency is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonably confident that in-use emissions of a engine certified at 3.5 g/Bhp-hr on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California fuel will emit in the range of 3.8 g/Bhp-hr on federal fuel, EPA will grant a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> federal certificate of conformity to a manufacturer which demonstrates compliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 3.5 g/Bhp-hr standard on California certification fuel. While it is possible that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual engines certified on California fuel may experience a slightly different offset  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when operated on federal diesel fuel (e.g., when a cetane number is much different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between the fuels), EPA believes that this will be the exception and that in-use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance on federal diesel fuel will average about 3.8 g/Bhp-hr. The use of federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel in engines certified on California fuel is consistent in this case with the fuel use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of sections 246(b) and 241(2), since EPA has concluded that such engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indeed comply with the clean fuel vehicle requirements on federal diesel fuel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

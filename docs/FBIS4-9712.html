			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of letter from Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel </F> Angel Burelli Rivas to Colombian President Cesar Gaviria on  Gaviria's victory in the OAS election for new secretary general]    [Text] Caracas, 28 March 1994    Your Excellency    Dr. Cesar Gaviria Trujillo    President of the Republic    Bogota    Mr. President:    Please accept my congratulations on your election to the  office of secretary general of the OAS. I offer you all the  cooperation I can give in the hopes that you, as secretary  general, will be able to coordinate the expectations and spirit  of this hemisphere that shakes because of its internal social  differences and the stupor of the unusual world disorder  unleashed by the most hurried changes in history. I trust that  in your hands this universe [as published] of ours will be  deserving of the name of "Continent of hope."    Cordially,    [Signed] Miguel Angel Burelli.</p>

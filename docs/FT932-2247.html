			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / International Company News: Sculley refines role at Apple MR John Sculley, chairman and chief executive of Apple Computer and one of the most widely known executives in the computer industry, will stand down as chief executive to focus on new business opportunities for the personal computer company. Apple announced yesterday that Mr Michael Spindler, formerly president and chief operating officer, will become chief executive while Mr Sculley will remain chairman. The announcement follows widespread speculation that Mr Sculley might be planning to leave Apple after 10 years with the company. Earlier this year, Mr Sculley was considered for the post of chairman and chief executive of IBM, but IBM rejected his proposal to merge parts of IBM with Apple and sell off other portions of IBM. Mr Sculley is also interested in starting his own high-tech company. 'That is a dream that I have for the future, but right now there is nothing else that I would rather be doing than building new business opportunities for Apple,' Mr Sculley said. 'I remain fully committed to Apple.' 'My personal interests have long been in defining the opportunities and technologies for Apple in the convergence of computing, communications and content,' Mr Sculley said. 'There is so much to be done here, and now I will be able to concentrate fully on these activities, while Michael runs the company.' Mr Sculley has been grooming Mr Spindler as his successor for the past two years. Mr Spindler was appointed Apple president and chief operating officer in 1990 in charge of Apple's day-to-day operations. A year later he joined the board of directors. Mr Spindler has long played a central role in Apple's corporate strategy and is credited by close associates with having been the 'management strength behind Sculley's vision'. In his new role as chief executive, however, Mr Spindler will be thrust into the public eye far more than in the past. The smooth management transition at Apple is in sharp contrast to the drama surrounding Mr Sculley's appointment as chairman in 1986 when Apple co-founder Mr Steve Jobs was ousted in a boardroom coup.</p>

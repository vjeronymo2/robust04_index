			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix II_Examples of ADR Initiatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Various bureaus and offices within the Department have been involved in implementing ADR processes. Some of the more prominent examples of ADR initiatives that reflect the Department's commitment to ADR include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1990, the Department disseminated to each of the Department's bureaus and offices an ADR survey designed to identify program areas that could be amenable to ADR techniques. Among the questions asked were: (1) The categories of disputes in which the organization is typically involved; (2) the number of cases during the prior 2 fiscal years that were (a) docketed, (b) settled, and (c) litigated, and the approximate cost involved; and (3) the organization's experience to date in utilizing ADR techniques.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department conducted an orientation program on ADR. Included in the orientation program was Senator Charles Grassley, one of the sponsors of the ADR Act, together with representatives of the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department conducted a one day training program on ADR. The training focused on the various methods of ADR and included representatives from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Transportation, each of whom shared their experiences in developing successful ADR programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department's Office for Equal Opportunity (OEO) provided training in basic and advanced mediation skills for OEO and personnel program officials and Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) counselors. OEO also issued a directive to bureaus and offices providing guidance on the development and implementation of ADR pilot programs consistent with 29 CFR part 1614. Under this directive each bureau and office is to submit an ADR pilot program plan delineating specific actions to be taken to incorporate ADR techniques into the EEO complaints process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department recently made consideration of the use of ADR in the resolution of discrimination complaints mandatory and has designated a Departmental EEO/ADR Coordinator and directed each bureau to designate a Bureau EEO/ADR Coordinator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department designated the Bureau of Reclamation as a pilot bureau in FY&hyph;93 for the purpose of testing the effectiveness of mediation in the resolution of EEO complaints and administrative grievances. The Bureau has relied exclusively on contract neutrals to serve as mediators for all dispute referred for ADR. Mediation has also been utilized by Reclamation in other program areas, including resource management and contract administration. Reclamation is assessing the results of its mediation program to determine whether to expand its usage to other program areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department's Office of Hearings and Appeals has implemented ADR as an alternative to administrative litigation. The Board of Indian Appeals and the administrative law judges vested with authority for adjudicating Indian probate cases have encouraged the use of settlement agreements to resolve these matters. Under 43 CFR 4.207, administrative law judges have been authorized to effect compromise settlements in probate actions where the parties concerned agree to compromise and where the judge establishes that all necessary conditions have been met. The Board of Contract Appeals has been effectively implementing ADR processes over the last 2 years in its cases. At the time a case is docketed, the Board issues an order notifying the parties to the dispute of the availability and benefits of ADR. Through actively promoting ADR as a viable alternative, the Board has settled a majority of its cases without the need to conduct a hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has recognized the benefits of ADR techniques, and a presentation on the topic was made at the Bureau's Solid Minerals Conference in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in April 1993. The BLM, in partnership with the Bowie State University's Center for Alternative Dispute Resolution, has provided basic Conflict Management ADR training to Personnelists and EEO practitioners, as well as to key management officials. The BLM will continue to work with the Center for ADR and other outside resources to provide training during Fiscal Year 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Minerals Management Service (MMS) has a rich history of ADR. The MMS's examples include (1) a process targeted at settling outstanding and contentious mineral royalty claims which has reduced appeals and litigation and increased royalty collections, and (2) more than a decade of conflict resolution training for offshore minerals management personnel and establishment and conduct of a joint review panel for constituent review of environmental documents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Bureau of Mines (USBM) has recognized the benefits of ADR techniques and has provided training to principal officials in the use of ADR techniques. Training was provided by a contractor for the Directorates of the Bureau on orientation to ADR techniques; Information and Analysis on September 28, 1993; Finance and Management, December 8, 1993; and Research on January 11, 1994. Training will also be provided to EEO Counselors by the EEO Staff and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service in June 1994. The Bureau plan to continue the use of ADR for EEO complaints and to expand it to other types of disputes. The EEO Office has used mediation and negotiation for EEO complaints in the precomplaint stage and also the formal complaint stage. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;14288 Filed 6&hyph;10&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;79&hyph;M  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAN TO BAR RESERVOIR COVERS WINS ASSEMBLY OK  </P> <P> Despite a warning that public health might be sacrificed so that well-to-do  residents can enjoy scenic views, the Assembly on Tuesday passed legislation  that could prevent Los Angeles from covering 10 reservoirs that store drinking  water for the city.  </P> <P> The bill was authored by Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles), who plans to  build a home with a commanding view of the Silver Lake Reservoir, one of five  at which the Department of Water and Power is considering building filtration  plants.  </P> <P> Although that reservoir is not among the 10 that might be covered, Roos said he  knows from years of living near the man-made lake that such reservoirs are a  "focal point" for surrounding neighborhoods.  </P> <P> "People in neighborhoods have certain rights that must be considered when we as  a government make decisions that ultimately impact the quality of their lives,"  Roos said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Aesthetic Values  </P> <P> The bill, approved on a 48-27 vote and sent to the Senate, would declare all  public reservoirs in the state "public resources" and require that any change  in them preserve the reservoirs' recreational, scenic and aesthetic values.  </P> <P> The measure would prohibit the state Department of Health Services from  ordering a reservoir covered or drained unless no "technically feasible"  alternative could be found.  </P> <P> "This is a modest attempt by Los Angeles neighborhood groups to bring a modicum  of clear thinking to what has thus far been a purely technical decision by  government bureaucrats," Roos said.  </P> <P> But Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) said Roos' bill deserved  "unanimous rejection."  </P> <P> "Should the public health, the quality and safety of our drinking water, be  jeopardized to enhance the views of a few wealthy homeowners?" McClintock asked  colleagues. "This would place recreation and aesthetics ahead of the storage  and delivery of water and ahead of the protection of the public health."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Animal Waste  </P> <P> McClintock referred to statements by DWP officials, who said the covers and  filtration plants are needed to keep trash, animal waste and cancer-causing  chemicals out of the water supply.  </P> <P> Neighborhood groups from Pacific Palisades to Elysian Park have formed a  coalition to fight the plan. Residents near the reservoirs say the covers could  ruin their views and attract vandals. The filtration plants, they say, could be  ugly and noisy.  </P> <P> "A neighborhood in its best form is a notion of community organization that  transcends just a group of people who happen to live next to each other," Roos  said. "There's something that binds them. What I am saying is that the binder  in some of our Los Angeles communities is our reservoirs."  </P></p>

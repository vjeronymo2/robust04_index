			<p>BFN     [Text] It was disclosed on 17 May that Democratic Socialist  Party Chairman Keigo Ouchi said at a meeting held with senior  members of a religious group in Tokyo in the evening of 16 May  that "we would like to form a nonpartisan caretaker government  after approval of the fiscal 1994 budget and resignation of the  cabinet en bloc." He made this remark as a countermeasure to  deal with the situation if no-confidence motion is submitted  against the Hata cabinet. According to a source concerned,  Ouchi took into consideration the possibility of including the  Liberal Democratic Party in forming the next coalition  government. Ouchi reportedly said: "We need to immediately  approve the bill for redrawing electoral districts for the House  of Representatives. After that, we can dissolve the Diet and  hold a general election in either November or December."</p>

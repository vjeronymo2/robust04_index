			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Yorkshire and Humberside (4) Ports are catching the tide - The dock that came back from the dead THERE ARE no plans to rename Hull's Alexandra Dock after Lazarus, but there should be. It was laid to rest in 1981, its overmanned quays undercut by leaner-staffed wharves in the Humber and Trent. It has just been successfully called back from the dead. Sustained by a swelling drip-feed of 300,000 tonnes of freight over the past 12 months, the 33-quay dock gets stronger by the day and is expected to reach its 1m-tonne annual potential of general cargo over the next few years, instead of being a decaying trading relic. Nothing could be more symbolic of what has happened to Britain's large old ports since the abolition of the national dock labour scheme in 1989. The scheme gave dockers at these ports jobs for life if they wanted them; the result was overmanning, resistance to change and restrictive practices. In Hull's case, this meant the port was open to shipping 24 hours a day, but ship owners were lucky to get one eight-hour shift out of its dockers. They sailed to 'non-scheme' or foreign ports or - having broken up larger cargoes at them - to wharves in the river. The removal of these constraints has led to surging growth at all the old 'scheme' ports, but Hull believes it is the only one that has actually reopened a silted-up, abandoned dock. 'We knew things would improve, but the speed of lift-off has surprised us,' says Mr Mike Fell, who manages Hull for Associated British Ports (ABP), its owner. 'We have yet to notice the recession because we have been growing continuously. The only downturn we have seen is in Russian timber imports - and that is because of the problems at their end,' he adds. His port is strategically important to the whole of the north of England for several reasons. Not only does it face mainland Europe and is easy to get to, but it also has 2,000 acres of land which can be developed. Moreover, it is versatile. Its King George, Queen Elizabeth and Alexandra Docks handle passengers, dry and liquid bulk cargoes, containers and roll-on, roll-off (ro-ro) freight. This spread kept it alive in the lean years; it now offers the chance of growth. Hull struggled to 5.3m tonnes of freight in 1989, the last year of the dock labour scheme. That was the year it shut its container terminal after 20 years of losses and a two-year wrangle over manning levels after United Carriers had pulled out, citing high costs and restrictive working practices. The terminal was reopened after the scheme was abolished and realistic staffing was agreed. United Carriers is back again, operations are profitable and the terminal is shortly to be extended in size by about 50 per cent. In the whole port there were no compulsory redundancies, but ABP's workforce went down from 1,400 to 400 almost overnight, with dockers now employed by six lean, stevedoring companies independent of ABP. The impact of managerial and marketing freedom - combined with pent-up pressure in the marketplace - was a leap in annual freight levels to 7.6m tonnes in 1991. The 1992 figure is surging towards 9m tonnes. Meanwhile, North Sea Ferries - jointly owned by P&amp;O of the UK and Nedloyd of the Netherlands - has broken through the 1m passengers-a-year barrier with its overnight services for people and their cars or trucks to Rotterdam and Zeebrugge. This is the base on which the port of Hull is now going to build, with ABP and Hull's users pouring in investment. ABP is spending Pounds 20m over 18 months, including Pounds 3.5m on four general purpose cranes, the first new ones for 20 years. It cost Pounds 2m to reopen Alexandra Dock - a considerable act of faith, as not a single piece of business was in sight. Now, formerly competing wharves operators are setting up on its quays. Port users have more than Pounds 10m of investment under way. Coal imports for power generation will rise from 500,000 tonnes last year to an annual 3m when new bulk handling, roads and terminal facilities are completed. Nippress, a Netherlands company, is putting in the port's first cold stores. Anglia Oil is expanding is palm oil business. Cement, paper, timber, steel and grain are all growing cargoes. Indeed, one irony is that while Hull first developed in the last century to export coal and import grain, it now exports grain and imports coal. North Sea Ferries has two Pounds 31m ro-ro superfreighters under construction which will operate to Rotterdam from a new jetty that ABP is building in the river itself. Adjustable linkspans between the jetty and the ships will enable them to load or unload at any stage of the tide. ABP's share of the project, which includes about 500,000 sq ft of paved, terminal area, is about Pounds 11m. The ships will carry 156 units - trucks with or without trailers - but will accommodate 114 drivers, rather than the handful of people that smaller vessels carry on present services. The new service will run at 22 knots and not have to pass through any locks, as the ships will already be in the river. One will sail in each direction at 10pm each night, enabling shippers to optimise the balance between driving time and rest periods. With 40m people in Britain within four hours' driving time of Hull - and with Rotterdam offering similar benefits in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and northern France - the benefits are obvious for trade in both directions. ABP also runs three other Humber ports - Immingham, Grimsby and Goole. They compete with each other, though not so much as to damage total profits by any of them doing inappropriate work at the expense of another. Between them, they shift a growing 60m tonnes of freight a year. 'This puts the Channel Tunnel in perspective,' Mr Fell says. 'It will do only one-tenth of the Humber ports' volume.' Much industry in the north of England and northern Europe has already taken the point and voted with its wheels. There are hiccups. Industrial heritage enthusiasts who rushed to get the Alexandra Dock listed after its closure have seriously impeded its return to work. Dock gates had to be de-listed to be modernised and wrangles are still going on because they are attached to listed quays and the new mechanisms proposed for them look too modern for some conservationists. 'We are trying to run a dock, not a museum,' Mr Fell says. 'It is private land and assets and there is no public access. The most infuriating thing has been a suggestion we should find old granite coping stones to repair the quayside instead of using modern materials. We are not talking about saving architectural gems, but restoring very ordinary facilities.' Nevertheless, he is a happy man. At a recent meeting with his opposite number in Hamburg, his host had to break off for an urgent labour relations problem. 'It was with much pleasure I told him I hadn't seen a trade union official for more than two years,' he said, smiling broadly.</p>

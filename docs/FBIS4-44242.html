			<p>BFN     [Text] After the Korean peninsula, Somalia, and  Bosnia-Herzegovina, this time around the assignment of Turkish  troops to duty in Azerbaijan is on the agenda. Prime Minister  Tansu Ciller is getting ready to call an extraordinary session  of the parliament in order to include Turkish troops in the  peace force envisaged to be sent to the region to find a  peaceful solution to the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict. The aim  is to somewhat impede Russia's fast- growing influence in the  region.    [Unidentified reporter] According to a statement by the True  Path Party, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller submitted her letter to  the president of the parliament asking for a mandate from the  Turkish Grand National Assembly to enable the Turkish troops to  serve in Azerbaijan. For this purpose, the Prime Minister will  call an extraordinary session of the parliament, which is  formally going into recess tomorrow.    Ciller is asking for the following mandate:    1. The presence of the Turkish troops in the CSCE peace  force to be assigned to duty in the Azerbaijani lands occupied  by Armenians.    2. Establishing a base in Turkey to provide logistical  support to this peace force.    It is expected that this base will most probably be located  in Erzurum. Russia wants its military troops to serve as a  peace force for the solution of the Azerbaijani-Armenian  conflict. Its rationale is that it will take a long time for  the CSCE troops to arrive in the region. Russia is claiming  that it will take almost ten days for the CSCE peace force to  arrive in the region if there is a cease-fire between the sides.  To undercut this argument, a group of CSCE countries, including  Turkey, wants to keep a force in Erzurum similar to the Hammer  Force in Incirlik. Russia is favoring one-sided military  intervention and the dispatching of troops to prevent the  clashes in the Caucasus. It is attaining its goal step by step.  For example, Russian troops are continuing to establish  themselves in the region to ensure the continuation of the  cease-fire between the separatist Abkhazian militants and  Georgian troops. Russia has received no mandate from the UN or  CSCE. Moscow is entering the region by direct agreements it  concluded with Georgia and the Abkhazian Autonomous Republic.</p>

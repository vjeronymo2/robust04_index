In addition, 100,000 household gas  meters will be installed this year in Ukraine.    In the opinion of experts from the State Oil and Gas  Committee of Ukraine, these measures will serve as the first  step towards introducing a normal economy drive and precise  controls on gas consumption in the country. This will also make  it possible to determine accurately what each enterprise owes.  It should be noted that this innovation by UKRHAZ is not an  excessive measure: last year, because of a lack of tight  controls by the gas corporation, the State Oil and Gas Committee  was forced to write off approximately three billion cubic meters  of gas as technical losses.    In light of the above, UKRHAZ has decided to begin  implementing the state program for producing household gas  meters at Ukrainian enterprises this year. This program was  developed jointly with the Ministry of Machine-Building of  Ukraine in accordance with the government decree of 19 April  1993 "On Measures To Reduce the Consumption of Fuel and Energy  Resources."    Ukraine needs a minimum of some three million gas meters,  while the number required in the household sector is more than 9  million meters, lus an additional 100,000 more each year for  farms furnished with gas. In light of these figures, UKRHAZ was  the initiator of the Cabinet of Ministers decree (3 April 1993)  that charged the Ministry of Machine-Building with setting up  the series production of individual gas meters beginning in the  second half of 1992. In accordance with the plan worked out by  the Ministry of Machine-Building, the gas meters will be  produced by six enterprises in Ukraine: the OKTAVA and  KYYIVPRYLAD production associations (both in Kiev), the  PROMPRYLAD Producation Association (Ivano-Frankivsk), the  Zhulyany Machine-Building Plant (Kiev Oblast), the ARKSI Concern  in Boyarka, and the joint venture formed by the MUKACHEVPRYLAD  leased enterprise and the Slovak PREMAGAZ enterprise  (Zakarpattya Oblast). The volumes of the planned series  production of gas meters are indicated in the table [table not  reproduced].    UKRHAZ acquired several types of meters abroad, and these  will also be installed in Ukraine. The cost of these meters has  so far not been announced. According to Ivan Kolesnyk, the  deputy chairman of UKRHAZ, 120 meters of the RL-20 type have  already been tested in nine Western Ukrainian oblasts. This type  of meter is designed primarily for use in small municipal and  everyday services enterprises and farms. The advantage of these  meters is that all their component parts can be produced from  materials that are manufactured in Ukraine.    A portion of the meters has already been produced by the  OKTAVA Production Association. However, this association ran  into difficulties at the end of 1992 because of a lack of  component parts. We should note that in 1991, OKTAVA was granted  the licensed equipment of the French firm SHLUMBERGER INDUSTRY  valued at $3 million dollars. In order to set up normal  production, OKTAVA also needed funds for mechanical assembling  and for the training of Ukrainian specialists. Following  negotiations between UKRHAZ and representatives of the French  firm, agreement was reached that the OKTAVA Production  Association would compensate the outlays of its foreign partners  with finished products and certain components. As indicated  above, OKTAVA has already completed the first batch of meters.  By the end of 1994, production is to reach 50,000 units for the  year. The enterprise's total annual projected output is 150,000  meters.    Incidentally, experts feel that Ukraine has rather good  technologies for manufacturing the diaphragms required in the  production of household gas meters -- precisely what OKTAVA  lacked. This technology has already been developed by the Kiev  branch of the Scientific-Research Institute of Polymer Fibers  and one other plant.    According to UKRHAZ estimates, Ukraine's enterprises will  not  supply the required initial volume of household meters until  1997. An incentives system is currently being developed to boost  the installation of meters by Ukraine's population. A household  gas meter is expected to cost $25. This price was set taking  into account the recommendations of a group of experts from the  World Bank.    UKRHAZ experts believe that given the world rates for the  price of gas ($55-$80 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas), gas  consumers will be interested in obtaining meters in the shortest  possible time, inasmuch as today's rates are based on the  average conventional per capita consumption of gas (1,000 cubic  meters) -- a figure that is virtually conventional. The fact is  that gas meter owners are already paying only 45 karbovantsi for  one cubic meter of gas, rather than the 90 karbovantsi paid by  the rest of the population of Ukraine.</p>

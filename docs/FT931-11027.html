			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Philippines set to make market come-back THE Philippines is set to become the latest less-developed country to stage a return to the international capital markets, having completed the restructuring of its commercial bank debt under the Brady plan last December. An offering of Eurobonds totalling at least Dollars 150m is due to be launched next Tuesday, following a series of investor roadshows. J. P. Morgan is arranging the issue, which will have an option for placement in the US market, under the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission's rule 144a. The issue was originally planned for last November, but was postponed twice due to poor market conditions. The three-year offering is expected to offer a yield of around 325 basis points more than the three-year US Treasury note. That would compare with India trading at 400 basis points over US Treasuries, Turkey at less than 300 basis points and Mexico at around 250 basis points, dealers said. The Philippines has no official debt rating. Speaking at an investor roadshow in London yesterday, Mr Jose Cuisia, the central bank governor, said that other Filipino borrowers hoped to follow the Republic's lead. Among those mentioned were the country's Development Bank and National Bank, as well as some private sector companies such as Philippine Airlines, Manila Electric Company and San Miguel. The Republic has an estimated Dollars 1bn of funding needs this year. However, it is not yet clear how much the government will try to raise in the international markets. It will seek to maximise the amount of borrowing from bilateral sources, such as international agencies, and will also raise funds in the domestic markets, through T-bills and central bank bills. However, with three-month rates at about 14 1/2 per cent, foreign currency borrowings offer substantial cost savings.</p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (8): Food for the tweakers - Accounting / Andrew Jack finds an endless list of creative techniques Creative Financial Accounting: Its Nature and Use by Kamal Naser, Prentice Hall, Pounds 17.95, 250 pages Twentieth Century Accounting Thinkers Edited by John Edwards, Routledge, Pounds 50, 320 pages For those looking for a primer on how to tweak numbers and boost assets or profits, the hunt is over. Kamal Nasar, lecturer in accounting and finance at Cardiff business school, has brought it all together. In a series of chapters, Nasar highlights a good number of the techniques used. The treatment of bad debts, circular transactions, capitalisation of interest, valuation of intangibles, borrowing across year-ends, sale and repurchase agreements, non-subsidiaries, foreign currency translation methods - the list is endless. Nor is all this new. He reminds us of the glorious days of differential depreciation by British railway companies in the 19th century, the manipulations of stock by US companies that led to the creation of the securities acts in the 1930s, and the generous scope for secret reserves in the inter-war years, triggering notorious court cases. He also provides some recent examples, such as the famous Midland Bank treatment of third world debt write-off as an extraordinary item. In general, when the text moves from description to analysis it becomes weaker. Nasar seems happier citing other's work in a detailed literature review than developing original thought. There is a glimmer of original research in a survey of auditors and company directors towards the end. But it sits uneasily with the rest of the book and does not deliver all it promises, although it suggests that nearly half the auditors consider creative accounting a 'legitimate business tool' and 96 per cent argue that rules can never completely prevent the practice. On books for the academic market, the epitome comes in Twentieth Century Accounting Thinkers. In a surprisingly candid introduction, David Solomons (himself featured in a chapter as one of the 'LSE triumvirate') argues mischievously that there has not been much great accounting thinking taking place of late, and that many of the best contributions have been neither by academics nor accountants. To an outsider, the contribution of Martti Saario to Finnish accounting hardly looks of much importance beyond a pretty tight-knit Nordic fan club gathering on dark winter nights. A series of chapters on different characters all seem navel-gazing and self-indulgent. They switch uneasily between a review of the subjects' writings, personal recollections by the authors, and simplistic and trivial biographical information, including which houses they lived in. Nevertheless, for those willing to persevere, some interesting history is tucked away. One of the more interesting stories is that of Edward Stamp. He engaged in a fierce and influential debate with the president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in 1969 on The Times letters page over the need for tighter accounting standards after GEC's merger with AEI. But it is hardly inspiring to discover that he was prohibited by his employer from publishing articles including one on LIFO because 'it might upset one of the firm's clients who used LIFO'. A similar tale concerns Kenneth MacNeal, whose 1939 article on accounts manipulation at McKesson &amp; Robbins was commissioned by Fortune magazine and then dropped because, he believed, of pressure from Price Waterhouse, the company's auditor, and the American Institute of Accountants. Stalwarts such as these two academics deserve a little recognition.</p>

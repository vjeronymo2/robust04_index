			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Gong Wen (7895 7186) and XINHUA </F> reporter Jiang Jun (1203 6511)]    [Text] Beijing, 28 Jan (XINHUA) -- Speaking at a State  Council Information Office news conference today, Wu Yi,  minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, said: China  achieved gratifying progress in its trade and economic relations  with foreign countries in 1993, with a total volume of exports  and imports reaching $195.72 billion, up 18.2 percent from the  preceding year. Of this, exports amounted to $91.77 billion and  imports, $103.95 billion, up 8 percent and 29 percent  respectively over 1992.    One of the outstanding characteristics of China's foreign  trade in 1993 was the slow growth of exports and rapid increase  of imports. Last year, China imported large amounts of raw and  semifinished materials, energy, and equipment because of  high-speed growth of the domestic economy, large scale  investment, and robust demand. As a result, the increase of  imports was 21 percentage points higher than that of exports,  leaving a deficit of $12.18 billion. According to statistics,  last year, imported commodities worth over $1 billion included  mainly aircraft, automobiles, rolled steel, crude oil, finished  oil, chemical fertilizers, industrial chemicals, and complete  sets of equipment. Wu Yi pointed out: These imported  commodities once again show that China is a large open market  with great potential. She added that China will strive to  strike a rough balance between exports and imports this year by  increasing exports rather than reducing imports.    Foreign investment in China in 1993 was double that in 1992,  and was almost equal to the total amount for the previous 14  years. Last year, China approved 83,265 foreign-funded projects,  with a total contractual value of $110.852 billion; and the  actual amount of foreign investment used in the period was  $25.759 billion. These figures were 70 percent, 90 percent, and  134 percent, respectively, more than in 1992. The investment  scale continually expanded, with an average contracted  investment per foreign-funded project reaching $1.33 million, a  12.9-percent increase over the $117.8 million of the previous  year. The proportion of technology intensive projects and  multinational corporations increased, and the area of investment  was rapidly expanding to the hinterland.</p>

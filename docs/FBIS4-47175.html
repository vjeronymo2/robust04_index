			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Speech of Levon Ter-Petrosyan, President of the Republic </F> of Armenia, at a Special Session of the Supreme Council of the  Republic of Armenia on 13 June 1994"]    [Text] Greatly Esteemed Chairman,    Greatly Esteemed Deputies!    I have the honor to present for your attention the basic  provisions of the draft constitution drawn up by the  Constitutional Commission of the Supreme Council of the  republic, putting the emphasis merely on the most important  principles and methodological tasks.    From the methodological viewpoint, the draft of the  Constitutional Commission is based on the following main  principles: regarding the Constitution as a purely legal  document designed to ensure the lasting stability and effective  activity of the state, to renounce situational opportunist  solutions, avoid political compromises, and be guided solely by  legal considerations, taking as a basis international experience  and the legislative tradition of our independent state. Just as  important also is the principle that any crisis situation that  lacks a constitutional solution must be excluded from the life  of the state and society.    First, concerning situational, opportunist solutions [line  illegible] processes is no secret, and it is sometimes said  publicly in this connection even that the easiest way to adopt a  constitution would be as follows: to adapt to the present  correlation of political forces represented in parliament and to  attempt to find some mutually acceptable version.    This would, indeed, be the easiest, but at the same time the  most dangerous way for the state because, considering the  variability of the correlation of political forces, it is not  hard to divine the kind of upheavals in the future of which a  constitution adopted in this way could be the cause. It would be  the primary business of each newly elected parliament to  immediately adapt the constitution to the new correlation of  political forces, and so on ad infinitum. That is, the present  struggle of the legislature and the executive to wrest powers  away from one another, which is characteristic of all young  independent states, would be a permanent factor of  destabilization--with all the obvious negative consequences.    Mutual concessions, meanwhile, are encouraging and essential  in the spheres of social symbiosis, the political modus  operandi, and diplomacy but wholly unacceptable in the spheres  of publicism and, particularly, jurisprudence, and consequently,  for a constitution, which unequivocally belongs to the sphere of  the latter, the possibility and expediency of political  compromise should be considered precluded. We do not have the  right, guided by opportunist, even if convenient,  considerations, to jeopardize the future stability of the state.    The mere fact of affiliation to the sphere of jurisprudence,  on the other hand, makes virtually obligatory for any  constitution the following principle--the need for the  assimilation of international experience, provided that  contemporary law has been shaped historically as the result of  the collective thought of mankind.    In this connection the draft of the Constitutional  Commission  almost totally reflects the principles of state independence and  all the basic provisions of international laws concerning the  rights of man and citizen and also the system of balances and  developed mechanisms of the harmonious activity of state  structures of modern democratic countries.    As far as the legislative tradition of the new independent  Armenian state is concerned, the starting documents for the  present draft constitution were the Declaration of Independence  of Armenia, the laws on the president of the republic and the  Supreme Council, and the law on the basic provisions of  independent statehood. The said documents, which are the results  of the activity exclusively of the present parliament, are not  reflected in the Constitutional Commission's draft with absolute  accuracy, of course, but have undergone serious revisions based  both on the demands of the times and conformity to the current  level of our legal and political maturity.    Taking this into account, I consider it my duty to observe  that I am in no way disposed to think of the four years that  have elapsed without a constitution lost time; on the contrary,  I consider this to have been a time of effective years of the  formation of new state structures, the creation of the  corresponding legislative field, and the testing of the adopted  laws, which will undoubtedly have a salutary impact on the  future constitution of the republic. And even though a  pessimistic or negative mood is predominant in today's  parliament, from a historical angle its role in the elaboration  of the Constitution of the Republic of Armenia is already,  nonetheless, indisputable.    The present draft embodies, and with all due consistency, I  believe, the principle providing for constitutional solutions  for all possible crisis situations in the life of the state and  society, which is the sole guarantor for the avoidance of  undesirable forms of domestic political struggle and civil war.  There is no particular need, I believe, to illustrate this  danger, inasmuch as its best illustration is today's situation:  It is obvious that the domestic political tension that is  predominant today both in Armenia and in other republics of the  former Union is to the highest extent the result of the simple  reality that the constitution and the laws do not provide for  legal solutions to critical situations.    The draft of the Constitutional Commission accomplishes this  task in full, in my opinion. Specifically, it excludes the  possibility of the stymieing of the adoption of most important  laws presented by the government, including the state budget,  and facilitates, as a counterbalance, the procedure of the  expression of no confidence in the government. It develops in  detail a mechanism of the removal from office of the president  of the republic in the event of his having committed serious  crimes. And, finally, as an extreme means of the surmounting of  crisis situations, it provides for the possibility of the  dissolution of the National Assembly and the scheduling of  special elections. It is important to mention also in this  connection that the National Assembly and the president of the  republic are equally endowed with the exclusive right to  schedule a referendum, which ensures the possibility of the  avoidance of undesirable confrontations and the handover to the  verdict of the people of contradictions that have arisen.    All the principles that have been set forth, which would  hardly be cause for serious objection, have at this time,  however, been set forth only on paper, and their actual  application is as yet, understandably, still attended by great  difficulties. We encounter once again here the ill-fated  question of the procedure of adoption of the constitution.  Having once fallen into the humiliating trap of the  Stalin-Brezhnev Constitution, surely we would find within  ourselves the power to cut this Gordian knot. Are there,  however, doubts that, in the event of parliament's adoption of  the constitution, all the said principles would be subordinated  to the demands of the political marketplace and that a  delayed-action bomb would thereby be placed in the foundations  of our state? I am forced to repeat again and again, therefore,  that under the conditions of the current political situation,  only a constitution adopted by way of a public referendum, with  the condition that it would subsequently be revised also only by  way of a referendum, could be a dependable guarantee of the  stability of the state.    And now about substantive aspects of the actual content of  Constitutional Commission's draft.    It has to be noted first and foremost that this draft makes  provision for the preservation of the system of presidential  rule of the republic. This has to be noted because it is this,  essentially, that is the main subject of the tumultuous  arguments surrounding the constitution. And this is absolutely  understandable, inasmuch as the fate of the constitution will  ultimately depend on the question of the kind of system of  government that the Republic of Armenia will adopt--presidential  or parliamentary. It is perfectly certain also that, in the  event of consensus on this matter being reached, the procedure  of adoption of the constitution would become a purely technical  task that was easily accomplished.    Considering the entire seriousness and justification of this  alternative, I consider absolutely unacceptable the cheap  demagogic methods with which an attempt is being made to portray  the presidential system as a despotic, and the parliamentary  system, a democratic, form of rule. In any event, historical  experience has shown that tyrannies and fascist regimes have  been born in parliamentary republics far more often than in  presidential republics.    So the counterpoise of the presidential and parliamentary  systems on a democratic basis should be considered fundamentally  mistaken and unacceptable. The indicator of a state's  democratism is not the presidential or parliamentary nature of  the system of government, but whether a form of government by  means of free elections has been established or not. What,  ultimately, else is the essence of democracy if not free  elections by means of which the people have an opportunity, if  not to elect invariably good authorities, then, at least, to rid  themselves of bad ones.    Thus, from the viewpoint of democracy, states are  distinguished from one another not on the basis of the system of  government but whether the authorities are elected or not. And  for this reason both the presidential and parliamentary systems  are equally democratic if they have been installed by means of  free elections, and, accordingly, tyrannies and monarchies  installed by different paths are undemocratic.    I have been forced to weary you, having dared to dwell in  detail on these simple and hackneyed truths, because the  aspiration to depict the presidential system as a tyranny is  already threatening to become a subject of delusive speculation.    Essentially, the choice of a presidential or parliamentary  system of government is connected not with the fact of  democracy, but with the question of the extent to which one of  these systems corresponds to the demands [line illegible] the  state and to what extent it is capable of tackling the tasks  confronting this state.    This way of framing the issue would be entirely apposite and  to the point were it the substance not of a contrived but of a  serious, philosophical dispute. It is hard, of course, within  the framework of this speech of a general nature around this  important matter to present a comprehensively argued analysis,  and I shall attempt at this time, therefore, to content myself  with an exposition merely of several basic propositions, even  though they might not contain anything new for you.    I am once again forced in this connection, first, to call  your attention to one false proposition by which an attempt is  being made to elevate the question of the priority of the  presidential or parliamentary system to the level of a  phenomenon of a national-psychological nature. Statements to the  effect that "the parliamentary system corresponds more than the  presidential system to our national character or national  mentality" and vice versa, whose groundlessness is obvious prima  facie, may be heard frequently.    The question of the preference of a presidential or  parliamentary system is, in fact, connected not with national or  psychological factors but with state traditions, the level of  development of the civil society, and the degree of formation of  democratic institutions. Discussion of the matter even could  make sense, therefore, only from this angle and provided that a  common methodological starting point is established.    And this common starting point, in my opinion, is as  follows:  To what extent is the system of government that is preferred  from the specific angle of the development of statehood and  society capable of catering for the efficient and smooth  activity of the legislature and the executive and a third  factor--the independence of the judiciary.    Before turning to a discussion of this question, it is worth  ascertaining, evidently, in what the essential, fundamental  difference between the presidential and parliamentary systems of  government consists.    It is by no means a question of terms; a state may have a  president elected by parliament or by public ballot, even, but  not in reality be presidential. It is essentially a question of  which authority forms the government: If the president, we are  dealing with a presidential system, if the said right is  accorded parliament, this is a parliamentary republic,  regardless of whether it has a president or not. Legal niceties  play no part here.    From the formal viewpoint, the principle, albeit not  absolute, nonetheless fundamental, of the separation of powers  is violated in a parliamentary republic, since the executive is  almost wholly dependent on the legislature. The formal aspect  would be of no significance, of course, were it not for the  negative influence of this dependence on the viability of the  system of government and the efficiency of the activity of the  legislature and the executive.    No one could, of course, deny the viability of a  parliamentary system, but no one could deny either the fact that  a parliamentary system is viable only in states in which one or,  at the most, two or three serious mass parties, each of which is  capable of forming a parliamentary majority and, thanks to this,  ensuring the effective activity of the government, has taken  shape historically. In the event of the election of patchwork,  multiparty parliaments, the parliamentary system leads to the  formation of a weak coalition government and incessant internal  upheavals, which very often end in coups and tyranny and,  frequently, outside interference also.    In the event of a parliamentary system being established,  the  same sorry and disastrous fate, I profoundly believe, awaits  Armenia, because one or two or three serious, mass parties could  take shape here only in dozens of years, at best.    I consider it superfluous to substantiate this conviction of  mine with historical facts, of which there are a multitude.  Although it is worth recalling in this connection the experience  of the first Armenian Republic, when in its two and one-half  years of existence there were four changes of government. Nor  have we forgotten, I believe, the first 13 months of  postcommunist Armenia, which should be seen as a most tense  period of confrontation of the republic parliament and the  government, for in the shortest time first the parliament  voluntarily relinquished its powers of formation of the  government, then things reached the point of the government  resigning.    Thus, for at least several years into the future, there will  be no alternative to the presidential form of government in the  Republic of Armenia, in all probability. Even if thanks to a  confluence of circumstances, parliamentary government were to be  restored in Armenia, our republic would several years later, all  the same, return to a presidential system; but at a price of  tremendous deprivations and incalculable losses. I am sure,  however, that our people will not make this absurd mistake.    I have already said that the viability of the system of  government of this state or the other is conditioned by the  extent to which it caters for the effective activity of the  legislature and the executive and the independence of a third  authority--the judiciary.    Aside from the elaboration of precise mechanisms fully  balancing and ensuring the productive activity of parliament and  the government, the draft of the Constitutional Commission has  successfully resolved also, in my opinion, the problem of the  independence of the judiciary.    The main guarantee of the independence of the judiciary  according to this draft is the status of irremovability of the  judges. This guarantee is strengthened considerably by the  inclusion in the system of the judiciary of two new  institutions--the Justice Council and the Constitutional Court,  which will be formed on a proportional basis by the president of  the republic and the National Assembly.    The Justice Council will present to the president of the  republic candidates for deputy chairmen of the Supreme Court and  members of the Supreme Court, and will present findings on the  nominees for justices and in respect to the suspension and  termination of the authority of justices.    The main competence of the Constitutional Court is the  establishment of the conformity of laws, National Assembly  decrees, and presidential edicts to the Constitution. The  clearest evidence of the independence of the Constitutional  Court is the fact that its decisions are final and not subject  to review, which precludes any possibility of any pressure being  brought to bear on it on the part of the president of the  republic or the National Assembly.    A most important achievement of the draft of the  Constitutional Commission should be considered the chapter  devoted to questions of territorial government and local  government, the essence of which consists in the rejection of  the idea of territorial self-government, which is incongruous  for Armenia.    This innovation, which at first sight seems staggering, is  justified, however, by the unique reality ensuing from the  particular features of our country and convincing arguments.    The formation of administrative-territorial units is, as a  rule, a result of a historical process that has emerged as a  consequence of feudal comminution or divisions ensuing from the  tasks of the separate settlement of the population in  multinational states. It cannot be ruled out, of course, that  geographical and economic factors might have played a certain  part in the formation of administrative-territorial units. But  historical and ethnic factors have in all cases been decisive,  especially since economic and geographical entities very often  coincided with the borders of feudal or ethnic possessions.    Thus, the principle of territorial self-government ensues  even in the most democratic countries not from republic  interests or managerial expediency, but is preserved simply as a  historical burden, which at times leads to serious clashes of  state and local interests. Territorial self-government,  aggravated by distinctive local interests, a proprietary budget,  and sundry privileges, inevitably contains within it the element  of federation, which is incongruous with the ever-growing  aspirations to the formation of unitary states. Until these  aspirations are justified, states attempt by means of laws to  reduce to a minimum the contradictions that exist between state  and local interests, but only a few, and only for a while, as a  rule, succeed in achieving a complete harmony of interests.    Armenia, free of this historical burden and being in terms  of  its composition a mononational country, has an opportunity,  unique in the world, to create a classical unitary state, which  could be the most dependable guarantee of its stability,  territorial integrity, and genuine independence.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Counting the true cost of aircraft leasing deals - Robert Peston examines the methods employed by British Aerospace to sustain its aviation business Buried deep in British Aerospace's accounts, published yesterday, is a note which could be as significant to the future prosperity of the UK's leading defence and aviation business as the Pounds 800m it has raised recently from the sale of its Rover car-making subsidiary to BMW. BAe has disclosed for the first time that it has obligations under leasing arrangements totalling Pounds 2.9bn, compared with income that it expects to receive on sub-leases of Pounds 1.8bn - and only an undisclosed part of that sub-lease income is contractually committed. What this shows is the substantial financial risks which it has been taking over the past two decades in order to sustain its civil aircraft manufacturing operations. In large part because of this leasing exposure, the company came perilously near to collapse over the past two years. As Mr Richard Lapthorne, its finance director, said: 'We got very close. Writing off a billion (as the company did in 1992, with a third of the losses stemming from aircraft leases) and not recognising the need for change would have bankrupted the company.' In the past three years, its commercial aircraft division has lost Pounds 1.79bn in aggregate, including exceptional reorganisation costs and provisions against losses on the leases, but excluding tax and interest payments. Those losses are many times greater than the modest aggregated profits made by the division in the boom years of the 1980s. Provisions made in the past two years to cover aircraft lease losses total some Pounds 600m. The company had implemented a text book recovery process, said Mr Lapthorne. The balance sheet was strengthened by the Rover disposal proceeds and last year's sweeping reorganisation of banking arrangements. This has given BAe the confidence to change its accounting procedures to give a more accurate picture of the leasing risks. The new balance sheet presentation shows that the main buyers of BAe's commercial aircraft have not been airlines, despite what common sense would suggest, but have in fact been banks and other financial institutions. These banks purchased the aeroplanes and leased them back to British Aerospace under agreements lasting between 15 and 20 years, depending on the type of aircraft. BAe then rented them on sub-leases of between three and five years to airlines. It has therefore been exposed to the risk of substantial losses if these short-term leases were not renewed. According to Mr Lapthorne, the appropriate analogy for BAe's civil aircraft business is not a normal manufacturing operation but, rather, property development: 'You don't sell airplanes . . . to airlines,' he said. 'You build an airplane speculatively and then sell it to the bank. You then find an airline as a tenant.' Mr Lapthorne said that all aircraft manufacturers engaged in this kind of financial engineering. In the early 1980s, when air travel was a boom industry and there was widespread inflation, each time a sub-lease expired it was replaced with another at higher rates. However, just like property developers, when recession hit the airline industry after the 1991 Gulf War, the aircraft lessors were hit by huge losses as some airlines ran into serious difficulties and were unable to make lease payments. The most prominent victim was GPA, the specialist leasing business, which had to be refinanced last year. However, it has emerged from BAe's accounts that its leasing exposure is enough to engender vertigo in the most phlegmatic finance director. Mr Lapthorne said that containing the risks figured among his top priorities within days of joining the company in July 1992. BAe has sold more than 200 series 146 regional jets since launch just over a decade ago. Of these, it is exposed to lease payments on half. In respect of 350 turboprop aircraft sales it has continuing financial exposure to 75 per cent. It is committed to make payments to banks and other financial institutions of Pounds 1.8bn in respect of head leases it has signed. More than Pounds 1bn of these payments are contracted to be made in more than five years, after most of the sub-leases have expired. There is a second category of exposure for BAe. Even when it sold aircraft directly to airlines rather than banks, it often provided guarantees on leases which the airlines themselves took out with financial institutions. Thus BAe has 'third party head lease and other recourse costs' of Pounds 1bn. In total therefore, its has gross head lease obligations of Pounds 2.85bn, or about three times the value of its shareholders' funds. Mr Lapthorne said that its total lease obligations are greater still, taking account of its share of its exposure to the head lease obligations of its associated company, Airbus Industrie. Some of its lease obligations are covered by income on sub-leases to airlines. It said that it expects sub-lease income to total Pounds 1.76bn. However, Mr Lapthorne said that this income is not all contractually committed. It is a combination of both committed and expected lease income, estimated on the basis of precedent. 'It's calculated like an insurance company calculates risk,' he said. 'It's a judgment, but our model and all the thinking behind it has been thoroughly audited.' Nonetheless, there is a shortfall of Pounds 1bn between this estimate of what it expects to receive and what it has to pay out on head leases, although some of the gap is covered by its Pounds 230m estimate of the disposal value of aircraft after they revert to it. BAe thus calculates its net risk of uncovered payments on head leases at Pounds 866m. Those payments will be made over many years, and BAe estimates that their present value - taking account of inflation - is Pounds 653m in today's money. It has therefore made provisions to cover losses of this magnitude, including an addition of Pounds 250m in respect of the turboprop aircraft made in the 1993 results. Its financial performance should only suffer further damage from the lease exposure if its estimates of sub-lease renewals and of the residual sale value of aircraft are too optimistic. However, Mr Lapthorne is confident that BAe is now accounting for its leasing exposure more prudently than any aircraft company in the world. He also says that disclosing the implicit leasing costs of selling aircraft, which was done within the company last year, has already had an important effect on corporate culture: 'In 1993, for the first time in the company's history, BAe turned down aircraft sales.' If precedent is any guide, shareholders must hope that the company fails to make a few more sales.</p>

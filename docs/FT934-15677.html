			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / German engineers in plea for Bonn aid GERMAN heavy engineering manufacturers need government funds to help them recover from the 'deepest, most difficult and longest recession' since the war, according to Mr Jan Kleinewefers, president of the VDMA industry association. Together with the federation of German industry, BDI, the association was considering a joint formal request for 'investment premiums' to encourage domestic customers to invest in new plant and machinery, he said at the weekend. Complaining of 'deafness' among politicians, Mr Kleinewefers said he was asking not for subsidies but for a limited injection of aid and the deferral of certain tax payments to stimulate capital spending. The cost of any investment relief measures would be cancelled out by an eventual increase in tax revenues, he claimed. His appeal, coinciding with a rigid clamp on government spending, has little hope of success. However, it seemed to be intended as a further signal to trade unions currently preparing their 1994 pay claims. Engineering employers recently cancelled current pay and conditions agreements in a largely symbolic move designed to underline the seriousness of the situation. Mr Kleinewefers told Munich journalists he expected 'real relief' from the coming pay talks. Personnel costs accounted for a third of all costs, he said, and could not be excluded from measures needed to aid recovery. Average net return on sales in the industry was less than 1 per cent this year, the lowest for 40 years. Only 75 per cent of capacity was in use, the lowest proportion since 1967. Employers in the west of the country had cut 200,000 jobs since 1991, while output had fallen 15 per cent. Domestic orders had fallen 17 per cent in the first eight months of this year and foreign demand was down 4 per cent. 'There are still no clear signs of recovery. The turning point in the recession is still to come.'</p>

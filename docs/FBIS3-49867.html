			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with General Stefan Dimitrov, chief of President </F> Zhelev's Military Office, by Lyubomir Denov; place and date not  given: "General Stefan Dimitrov: The President Cannot Send  Tanks"]    [Text] [Denov] General Dimitrov, is there a decree that  regulates the functions of the president's Military Office, and  if there is one, why was it not published?    [Dimitrov] There really is such a decree and it is not such  a terrible thing. It is not a secret. The head of state does  not issue secret decrees. If it has not been published up until  now, it is a result of the Presidency's internal order.    [Denov] Why did you write the letter that explains the  prerogatives of the Military Office to the Army chiefs?    [Dimitrov] It was a high time to specify the status of the  Military Office. Since we mainly work with the Ministry of  Defense and the General Staff, Minister Aleksandrov and General  Petrov had to be informed. Democracy requires elements of  organization, order, and discipline. The decree outlines the  prerogatives of the Military Office, while the letter defines  the order of mutual relations between the working entities of  the two institutions. If someone is disturbed by regulating  relations, then let him say so publicly and explain himself.    [Denov] Was this coordinated with the prime minister?    [Dimitrov] I find it difficult to answer this, because I did  not attend all the meetings between the president and the prime  minister.    [Denov] Did you seek the opinion of the defense minister and  the General Staff chief on the matters invoked in the letter?    [Dimitrov] Of course. We had a joint discussion before the  president signed the letter. Different opinions were expressed  during the discussion about various formulations of the draft  letter. Afterward, the disputed elements were eliminated.    [Denov] Is it true that the chief of the General Staff  sharply reacted against this letter?    [Dimitrov] You must ask General Lyuben Petrov about that.  This way, we, too, would learn what his objections are regarding  anything related to the prerogatives of the president's Military  Office.    [Denov] Do you have a good relationship with Minister  Aleksandrov and General Petrov?    [Dimitrov] In their activities, the minister of defense, the  General Staff chief, and the Military Office must be guided by  the Constitution and the country's laws.    [Denov] Does it mean that the president's Military Office  obtains leading functions in anything related to the Army?    [Dimitrov] Of course not. The speculations about the  prerogatives of the Military Office date back to the first day  of its establishment. We have refuted various rumors several  times. You only have to look at the letter to become convinced.  It explicitly points out that the Military Office has no  leading and control functions vis-a-vis the General Staff and  the Bulgarian Army. In addition it points out that the Military  Office assists the president as a supreme commander in chief in  implementing his prerogatives by collecting, analyzing, and  summing up information.    [Denov] According to the letter, is the information that the  Military Office will receive from the Army leading entities not  too serious in anything related to its scope and secrecy? Does  this information provide the opportunity to practically activate  the Army above the heads of the Defense Ministry and the General  staff?    [Dimitrov] No. At first glance, the information that the  letter specifies is voluminous, but the frequency of preparing  and sending it varies. Please note that the letter talks about  copies of documents circulated in the General Staff and the  Defense Ministry. Not a single document will be specially  prepared for us. The hint that such information could be  utilized in order to activate the Army is food for naive people.  Placing the Army in various degrees of combat readiness is  strictly regulated in the military's hierarchic structure and is  absolutely impossible as someone's self-initiative. This also  applies to the president's Military Office. Only specific  members of the General Staff can place Army units in a state of  combat readiness.    [Denov] What document regulates the existence of the  president's Military Office?    [Dimitrov] The Military Office was established on the basis  of Article 102, Paragraph 3, Item 5 of the Bulgarian  Constitution, which allows the president to determine the order  and organization of the services that act next to him.    [Denov] Since you say that the information about the letter  was released in a biased manner, could you say who is behind  this affair?    [Dimitrov] Those are people who do not care about the  country's security, democracy, or proper relations between the  state institutions. This is another attempt to drive a wedge  between the state institutions' working entities. Those people  compromise themselves and demonstrate elementary incompetence  and legal nihilism. I think that this is another attempt to  destabilize the situation in the country.</p>

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Gunshots fail to deter Algeria's fundamentalists SECURITY forces ringed mosques and fired warning shots at Friday prayers as Muslim fundamentalists chose a hardliner to replace the leader arrested in a mounting crackdown on their movement. The show of force by riot police and soldiers backed by water cannon at fundamentalist strongholds came two days after the new military-backed rulers banned political activity at Algeria's 10,000 mosques. The Islamic Salvation Front named a hardline member to replace Abdelkader Hachani, the party's moderate former acting leader, arrested on Wednesday on charges of urging soldiers to desert. It was not immediately clear what changes Othmane Aissani, 37, would bring to the Salvation Front. Several clerics were arrested yesterday after delivering political speeches and 'calling for violence' at three small mosques around Algiers, the official APS news agency reported. At the Es Sunna mosque in the working-class suburb of Bab el Oued in Algiers people scurried for the safety of doorways in the narrow streets after shots rang out. 'Tell everyone they want to kill us. Tell everyone they want to stop us from having our Islamic state,' an angry woman shouted. 'This is normal here most Fridays,' a youth said with a resigned shrug. Bab el Oued is one of the two strongholds of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS). But yesterday was no normal day. Supporters of the FIS were determined to use the mosque not just for prayer but as a focus for their anger and frustration over events of the past two weeks, which have seen the annulment of parliamentary elections and the denial of their party's certain electoral victory. The security forces had surrounded the Es Sunna mosque and the larger Kouba mosque to enforce tough edicts against political activity at mosques. 'Last week there were two or three thousand people praying in these streets round the mosque,' said one of the Es Sunna residents. 'They have been trying to intimidate us since early this morning, when they searched the flats round the mosque.' Young men, most with the distinctive long black beards identifying themselves as FIS supporters and some with rolled prayer mats under their arms, had gathered early in front of the mosque. They looked sullenly at the riot police and the display of army trucks and a lone water cannon in an adjoining street to the small mosque. But they were careful to avoid provocation, observing the new ban on praying in the streets. The firing of blanks in the air, lasting for less than 10 minutes, was either panic by soldiers or a deliberate attempt at intimidation. If intimidatory, it had the desired effect. And with the loudspeaker cut, fewer than 500 heard the imam inside the mosque. The Es Sunna mosque symbolises the problems which successive Algerian governments have created for themselves by their ambiguous encouragement of, and failure to control, the state religion, Islam. It also helps explain the political success of the FIS. The construction of this mosque began 10 years ago. It remains unfinished, like 5,490 others of the total 9,073 known mosques in Algeria. Mosques have to be completed and possess an imam who has passed official examinations before being considered a state mosque with official funding. The FIS has exploited this loophole, keeping the mosques deliberately unfinished, sometimes by just not facing the concrete exterior with bricks or tiles, like Es Sunna. In this way they can appoint their own 'free' imam, and it is these men who have been urging the faithful to establish an Islamic state in Algeria. Bab el Oued is fertile ground for such an appeal. Once the centre of mainly Spanish-speaking poor colonials, since independence it has come to house many of the city's poorer families, who find themselves at the bottom of the ladder in terms of jobs and social opportunity. 'I am a trained lathe operator but I have never had a job,' said Mustafa, aged 25, as he waited in a stairwell for the tension in the streets to die down. 'I finished 2 1/2 years' military service but in the last three years I have been unemployed.' He lives in a two-room flat with a family of nine, of whom only two brothers are working. 'The government and the FLN (the former ruling party) has done nothing but rob us. Look at the ministers with their big villas and we are left to struggle to eat.' He said he voted for the FIS not out of religious conviction but as a protest. 'At least they might give me some work.' Dressed in jeans and black leather jacket, he talked of a pen-friend in Hull, and seemed not untypical of Algeria's disillusioned youth, who make up 60 per cent of the 25m population. These are the people Algeria's new military-backed government has to win over if it is to pose a credible alternative to the FIS.</p>

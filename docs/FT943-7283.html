			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Spot the Real Thing It all started in May 1886 when John Pemberton, a pharmacist in Atlanta, Georgia, cooked up an unusually exhilarating brain tonic. Its stimulative effects came mainly from two ingredients: the coca leaf of South America, a source of cocaine, and the seeds of the cola tree of West Africa, a source of caffeine. He called it Coca-Cola, and a legend was born. Part of that legend rests on the mystique that surrounds the Coca-Cola formula. According to company folklore, only two people within the Coca-Cola empire know how to make Coke, and the only copy of the recipe is locked away in a vault, unavailable to anyone in any circumstances except by a formal vote of the board of directors. This has not stopped people trying to work out the secret for themselves. The cynic would say the formula is simple: one part sugared water to 99 parts hype. But piecing together the available information, it is possible to pick up some clues as to the recipe. In most countries, the basic ingredients are written on the side of the can or bottle. The biggest two are water and sugar. Caramel gives the drink its characteristic dark colour, and phosphoric acid gives it a tang. The caffeine is still there, though in much smaller quantities than a century ago. So are the coca leaves, but they have been decocainised. The big secret lies in the so-called 7X portion of the formula - the part listed as 'natural flavours' on the container. This comprises seven natural oils. Six are thought to be orange, lemon, nutmeg, cinnamon, coriander and neroli (from a variety of orange blossom). The seventh is lavender or lime, according to which version you believe. Knowing the list of ingredients, of course, is not the whole of the mystery: you still have to know how to mix them. Undaunted by the secrecy, however, people have been trying to imitate Coca-Cola since the day it went on to the market. Pepsi-Cola's origins go back almost as far as Coca-Cola's: to 1894, when Caleb Bradham, a North Carolina pharmacist, started selling a cola-based drink containing pepsin as a tonic for the relief of dyspepsia. Of the many smaller imitators worldwide, by far the most prominent today is Royal Crown Cola, a Texas-based company formerly owned by the US financier, Victor Posner, but last year taken over by a newly formed New York-based conglomerate called Triarc. RC Cola has been making and selling cola under its own name for decades, but since 1991 it has had another sideline: supplying cola syrups to Cott, a Canadian soft drinks company, which in turn uses them to make own-label colas for supermarket chains. These Cott-supplied colas are better packaged than earlier private-label colas were. They also taste better: in conjunction with Cott, RC Cola has developed new formulas to meet individual retailers' specifications. But do they really taste anything like Coke or, for that matter, Pepsi? First, it can be surprisingly hard to tell the difference. In the absence of any independent consumer research on the subject, the FT's New York bureau held a highly unscientific blind tasting of Coke, Pepsi and PC Cola (a Cott-supplied private label). Of the six people who took part, only one succeeded in singling out the interloper. Second, who cares? History has shown that people do not buy Coke for its flavour. In 1985, Coca-Cola took the extraordinary decision to abolish Coke in the US and replace it with the smoother, sweeter New Coke, which had consistently scored higher in blind tastings. The move was a disaster: the US public said changing the taste of Coke was like burning the American flag. Back came the old Coke, and it has been out-selling every other soft drink since.</p>

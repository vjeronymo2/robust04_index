			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Billionaire populist on a mission / Profile of US presidential proto-candidate Ross Perot It is customary in the United States to announce an intent to run for the highest office in circumstances of appropriate gravity. The backdrop of Mount Rushmore, with its four sculpted presidential heads, is not mandatory, but it is the sort of prop that helps. Ross Perot did it on Larry King Live. Perhaps he was just cocking a snook at the political system with which he is so profoundly discontent. Perhaps he was being politically astute beyond all measure, for if the age of the telepopulist can be said to have dawned under Ronald Reagan, it is reaching its acme, or nadir, in this strangest of election years and in the as-yet-undeclared but widely assumed independent presidential candidacy of H (for Henry) Ross Perot. It is easy to be dismissive, or adulatory, about Perot. The indomitable Molly Ivins, the best big journalist in Texas, probably sums it up best: 'As Texas billionaires go, he is one of the best we got.' The exception is that most of this breed do not range that far outside the oil 'bidness' and buying a few senators and foreign potentates. Perot is much more than this. He is a man of left and right, in favour of abortion and gun control and against the Gulf war, but opposed to welfare and a hero in the business world: the apolitical billion dollar action man with a mission to rescue the people from the travails of government, a Jimmy Stewart from hard-scrabble Texas minus 10 inches, with a crew cut, jug ears and, as Ms Ivins notes, 'the voice of a chihuahua'. But he is also a fair-sized folk hero for his missions to find prisoners of war in Indochina and to rescue his own employees from the Tehran mullahs, and he has compiled a corporate record worthy of envy, from the time when, not long out of the Navy, he met his annual IBM sales target by the middle of January. The ultimate entrepreneur, he started his own data processing company with Dollars 1,000 in 1962, sold it to General Motors 22 years later for Dollars 2.5bn, and, two years after that, was paid another Dollars 700m by GM to leave the board and shut up about the company's failings (which, characteristically, he did not). But all this does not really explain why Perot is running George Bush and Bill Clinton close in national public opinion polls. After all, businessmen do not normally aspire to run the nation. The last 10 presidents have comprised eight politicians, a soldier and an actor, none of whom can really be said to have met a substantial payroll outside of politics and Jimmy Carter's peanut warehouse. This may be part of the Perot populist appeal at a time of general disenchantment with politics as usual and with Messrs Bush and Clinton in particular. But the real clue to his phenomenal rise - and maybe ultimately to his political fall - lies in the medium he has chosen to carry him to a state beyond all rational expectations; and not just any medium, a very special and very popular one. This is where Larry King Live comes in. Perot did not really announce a candidacy but artfully allowed it to be dragged out of him by the eponymous television talk show host, a gravel-voiced veteran of the late night, who wears trademark braces, keeps his sentences short and requires the same of those to whom he talks. Perot said he would run if the people put his name on every state ballot and, if they did, he had Dollars 100m of his own money to finance the effort. Next stop was Phil Donahue (the daytime programme for housewives) and then 60 Minutes, the grandaddy of current affairs programmes and the accepted confessional for those who want to get something off their chest, and then David Frost, always good for respectability, as Richard Nixon found, and too many more shows to mention. And if the public's perception of what he stood for remained hazy, they firmly grasped that one of the great tools of a Perot presidency would be the electronic town meeting, in which a wired country could simply call up its president and determine national policy. Perot told Frost this was exactly what he would do if raising taxes was an issue. Hang the Congress, stuff the Supreme Court, never mind the Constitution, this would be a personal relationship. Which is precisely the purpose - and the popularity - of most of the programmes on which Perot had appeared. It was indeed telepopulism in the raw. But, having thrived by the sword, Perot must now endure its cuts. A week ago, after a particularly rough television session with professional political journalists asking a lot of boring questions about the feasibility of his budget cutting proposals, he confessed he had been badly advised. For the record, he had said the Dollars 400bn budget deficit could be pretty much eliminated overnight by Dollars 180bn savings on fraud and waste, cutting Dollars 100bn from welfare, and getting Japan and other US allies to kick in another Dollars 100bn for the privilege of sheltering under the US defence umbrella. Beating a quick retreat, his campaign promptly announced that the proto-candidate would be giving no more interviews - not for 60 minutes but for 60 days. This might be a brilliant ruse. Having excited interest, he can let Messrs Bush and Clinton get on with unimpressing the country and then descend again with enough thought-out policies to emerge as a saviour. He might also spend the time building the nuts-and-bolts national political organisation that his army of amateur volunteers does not yet constitute and the lack of which causes most independent candidacies to wither. But it is also a big gamble. First, the two main candidates might establish themselves while he is out of the public eye, and being almost invisible in the wake of the Los Angeles disturbances has probably not helped his credibility, even if it has not necessarily enhanced that of the other two. Second, and keeping very much in the public eye, a lot of awkward questions are now being asked about his conduct as a businessman and some of the things he has done for his government. This probing may not be worse than anything Bill Clinton has had to endure this year, but it is now a necessary rite of passage for a would-be president and it may be hard for a confessedly autocratic businessman to handle. Further, though Perot is deeply critical of government, it is undoubtedly the case that he has waxed rich through dealings with it, from his first and fortune-making contract to computerise medical care payments in the 1960s, all the way to his current negotiations for federal assistance to develop his newest airport in Fort Worth. Some of his extra-curricular activities on behalf of the government are being scrutinised. Running missions to Indochina and responding to an administration approach to bail out Du Pont, Glore, Forgan, the failing securities firm, in the early 1970s appear above board. But lending a helping hand and offering Dollars 50m to the Nixon White House's public relations effort over the Vietnam War and running errands for Ollie North of Iran-contra notoriety go down less well. Even the precise circumstances of the rescue in 1979 of EDS employees in Tehran, especially as glamorised in Ken Follet's novel Wings of Eagles, are now being questioned. A final curiosity centres on his patent animosity towards George Bush. Ostensibly, it is because Perot believes the president has failed to lead, but there seems more to it. One suspicion is that Mr Bush's blocking of further attempts to find Americans missing in Indochina has infuriated Perot; another that it is rooted in the contrast between down-at-heel Texarkana, where he grew up, and the mahoganied oil clubs of Houston, which are Mr Bush's milieu. Whatever the cause, there is one quality to Perot on which all agree. He remains a brilliant salesman. This, of course, is the essence of the populist tradition, regardless of whether the merchandise be computer systems or politics or snake oil or a combination of all three. The country, it seems, is tempted by the wrapping but it has not really tasted the ingredients. PERSONAL FILE 1930 Born, June 27 in Texarkana, Texas.

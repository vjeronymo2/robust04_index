			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The public comment period on the draft EIS (DEIS) began on July 1, 1993, and the notice of availability was published July 16. Full DEIS documents were mailed to potentially affected agencies, public libraries, many interest groups and to all who requested the complete DEIS. In addition, the DEIS summary, a schedule of the 16 hearings, and a request to report wolf sightings were printed in a flyer that was inserted into the Sunday edition of 6 newspapers in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho with a combined circulation of about 280,000. In mid-June 1993, the Service sent out a letter to over 300 groups, primarily in Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, offering a presentation on the DEIS. As a result, 31 presentations were given to about 1,000 people during the comment period on the DEIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the public review period from July 1 to November 26, 1993, on the DEIS, comments were received from over 160,200 individuals, organizations, and government agencies. This degree of public response indicated the strong interest people have in the management of wolves. A summary of the public comments was mailed to about 42,000 people on the EIS mailing list in early March 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final EIS was filed with the Environmental Protection Agency on May 4, 1994, and a notice of availability was published on May 9, 1994. The reintroduction of nonessential experimental populations of gray wolves to Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho was the Service's proposed action. The four alternatives considered in detail in the EIS were (1) Natural Recovery (No action), (2) No wolf, (3) Wolf Management Committee, and (4) Reintroduction of Nonexperimental Wolves.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Record of Decision on the EIS was signed by the Secretary of the Interior on June 15, 1994. The Secretary of Agriculture signed a letter concurring with that decision on July 13, 1994. The decision directed the implementation of the Service's proposed action as soon as practical.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service already has an active wolf management program in Montana because of the presence of breeding pairs of wolves. About 65 wolves now occupy northwestern Montana, and most of these occur near the Canadian border. The Montana program monitors wolves to determine their status, encourages research on wolves and their prey, provides accurate information to the public, and controls wolves that attack domestic livestock. Wolf control consists of translocating wolves that depredate on livestock to reduce livestock losses, and to foster local tolerance of nondepredating wolves to promote and enhance the conservation of the species. The control program does not relocate wolves to accelerate the natural expansion of wolves into unoccupied historic habitat. Wolf control includes removal of wolves that attack livestock and, although 19 wolves have been removed in that program, the wolf population in Montana has continued to expand at about 22 percent per year for the past 9 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Reintroduction Site <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service proposes to reintroduce wolves into Yellowstone National Park. The Park was proposed as a site for the experimental population area after much deliberation by the Service and others. The Park was selected due to several factors. The vast remote habitats of the Park are under tight Federal controls, and it has high-quality wolf habitat and good potential wolf release sites. It is also distant from the current southern expansion of naturally formed wolf packs in Montana. Thus, any wolf pack documented inside the experimental area would likely result from reintroduction into the Park rather than from natural dispersal from extant wolf populations in Canada or northwestern Montana. The Service is also proposing establishment of a nonessential experimental population of wolves in central Idaho in a separate proposal in today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service has determined that the proposed reintroduction effort in the Park has the greatest potential for successful recovery of the gray wolf in the conterminous United States, due to ecological and political considerations (Service 1994). Reintroduction of wolves into the Park will enhance wolf population viability by increasing the genetic diversity of wolves in the Rocky Mountain population, increase genetic interchange between segments of the population, and is projected to accelerate reaching wolf population recovery goals 20 years sooner than under the current natural recovery policy. No critical habitat would need to be designated; millions of acres of public land containing hundreds of thousands of wild ungulates currently provide more than enough habitat to support a recovered population of wolves in the Park and surrounding area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gray wolves that are reintroduced into the Park would be placed on Federal lands and classified as a nonessential experimental population. In so doing, the Service would accelerate the recovery of gray wolves in the northwestern United States while reducing local concerns about excessive government regulation of private lands, uncontrolled livestock depredations, big game predation, and the lack of State government involvement in the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Establishment of an experimental population of gray wolves in the Park would initiate wolf recovery in one of the three recovery areas described as necessary for recovery of gray wolves in the northern Rocky Mountains. The only alternative site identified at this time, central Idaho, is planned for future reintroduction efforts. There are no existing or anticipated Federal and/or State actions identified for this release site that are expected to have major effects on this experimental population. For all these reasons, and based on the best scientific and commercial data available, the Service finds not only that the release of wolves will further the conservation of this endangered species, but also that the Park constitutes the highest priority reintroduction site that will best serve to further the conservation of this species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

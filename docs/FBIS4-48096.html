			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Saliou Toure, minister of higher education and </F> scientific research, in Abidjan -- live]    [Excerpts] Fellow countrymen: As you know, our country is  hard hit by the economic crisis that has persisted for more than  a decade now. The Ivorian school system has not been spared by  the effects of this crisis, which has affected all aspects of  life. Since 1990, the school system has been experiencing  serious problems which have been of great concern to the  government. Virtually, not a single week goes by without a  strike or serious and unjustified acts of vandalism occurring in  the national university and in our schools. Loyal to its policy  of peace, the government has employed and continues to employ  all avenues of dialogue to remedy the situation. However, we are  compelled to say that the situation has been going from bad to  worse. It is therefore with a sad heart that we have come to  talk to you about the Ivorian school system and the crisis it is  experiencing. [passage omitted]    Our children must go to school and sit their examinations  without allowing themselves to be distracted by the surprising  behavior of some them -- those belonging to the Federation of  University and High School Students of Cote d'Ivoire [FESCI]  which we have to mention by name -- who constitute the activists  of the school system.    FESCI is a student organization that is supposed to  represent  students' interests but in actual fact this organization is  rather quick to engage in politics in accordance with Article 2  of its by- laws, which states that, quote, FESCI reserves the  right to express its opinion on any national issue directly or  indirectly affecting the education and training of the youth,  unquote. It also states in the preamble of the same by-laws  that it believes, quote, that the current crisis in school and  university circles cannot be curbed with circumstantial  measures, but with a total overhaul of our country, unquote.  These are all facts that prove the indisputable political  involvement of FESCI, which is not a students' union as one may  think. [passage omitted]    The case of FESCI presents a disturbing peculiarity in the  eyes of the law. Although FESCI was dissolved on 20 June 1991  by the government, following the murder of the student Thierry  Zebie on 17 June of the same year, it has continued its  activities with the tolerance of the public authorities.  [passage omitted] Today, the government's tolerance, which is  aimed at defusing tension, tends to be perceived as a civic  weakness. However, the 30 July 1992 Amnesty Law was not meant  to reconstitute FESCI.    Consequently, in the eyes of the law, FESCI is still a  dissolved association. The fact that it continues to exist  implies the maintenance or restitution of a banned association,  which is mentioned and punished under Article 34 of Law 60315 of  21 September 1960. This law provides for a penalty of 300,000  CFA francs and one to three years' imprisonment. The truth of  the matter is that FESCI doubtlessly appears to be the secular  arm of certain political parties, which use it as they wish to  settle their differences and to engage, in the name of  education, in insurrectional political activities. Hence, the  incoherent and, sometimes, surprising nature of some student  demands. [passage omitted]    The educational, economic, financial, social, and security  repercussions are incalculable. Educationally, the prestigious  image of the school system has been tarnished. For some years  now, lectures and tutorials are not conducted according to the  required academic standards. Academic years are cut short --  instead of nine, they are spread over only three months. The  most serious consequence of this situation is the nonrecognition  of our certificates abroad. Today, a second degree holder from  Abidjan who wants to register at an European or American  university is forced to start afresh from the first year as if  he just obtained his senior high school certificate. Can we  continue like this? [passage omitted]    History will surely not forgive us. We must therefore  react to stop this lawlessness. The government will assume its  responsibilities with the support of all those who are committed  to saving the Ivorian school system by upholding the supremacy  of the law.    To conclude, the crisis in the Ivorian educational system --  such as we have just described it -- concerns us all. It must  first concern the university and other students themselves, who  are the first victims because the issue at stake relates first  and foremost to their future. It must concern parents who,  after sacrificing their savings and even going sometimes to the  extent of borrowing money to educate their wards to guarantee  their future, will gain nothing if their efforts go up in smoke.  It must concern teachers, supervisors, and all those who in one  way or the other are involved in educating the sons and  daughters of this country. It must concern all who care about  the country's future, which depends primarily on the youth and  its education. Last, it must concern all those who care about  the future of this country as a whole.    It is therefore not without bitterness that we point out the  undignified and selfish behavior of a minority of our countrymen  who, after attaining comfortable positions as products of our  school system, are now preventing our children from enrolling in  our educational establishments by masterminding terrorist  actions committed unrelentingly by an insignificant group of  students at our university campuses and second cycle  institutions.    The government is aware of the difficulties facing our  children today, considering the persistent economic crisis whose  most recent consequence is the devaluation of the CFA franc to  enable the recovery of our various economies, recovery that can  only be achieved in an atmosphere of sustained social peace.  Each one of us at whatever level, including the students, is  suffering the hardships brought about by the crisis. However,  in spite of the adverse effects of the crisis, Cote d'Ivoire  continues to view education as a priority among priorities.  Indeed, the government continues to allocate 45 percent of its  recurrent budget to the education sector. Social transfers  alone, that is accommodation, scholarship allowances, feeding,  and diverse subsidies, account for 42 percent of this budgetary  allocation. This has never been seen anywhere, not even in the  developed countries. [passage omitted]    We thought that these efforts, virtually unique in the world  in relative terms, would tone down the protesting zeal of our  students and render them more reasonable. Unfortunately, as  anyone would realize, that is far from the case. I therefore  urge students to be more realistic and to appreciate  government's efforts within our social and economic context.  The government calls on all to be vigilant and mobilized to  eradicate, once and for all, this scourge which could seriously  compromise our country's economic recovery if care is not taken.    On its part, the government will do all within its power to  quickly and definitely restore law and order in our schools and  colleges. [passage omitted] The issue at stake is the future of  our dear country, Cote d'Ivoire. The future of our youth is so  vital in this regard that political calculations alone cannot  remove the present tragedy of the Ivorian school system. For  goodness sake, let us stop toying with the future of the youth  in order that the Ivorian educational system may regain its past  glory and credibility.    Dear university and other students, many are those who,  today, feel the need to carry on peacefully with their studies.  We urge you to come back to your senses and to go back to  school quietly, with discipline, and above all with tolerance.  Cote d'Ivoire, which has made enormous sacrifices to turn you  into worthy citizens, counts on you to meet the challenges of  development. However, it must be clear that the government can  no longer afford to look on patiently and that in the event of  any disturbances adequate measures will be taken to restore  peace. Let us together save the Ivorian educational system in  order that Cote d'Ivoire may always remain united and  prosperous. Thank you.</p>

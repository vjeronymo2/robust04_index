			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Domino shares fall 44p on warning THE SHARE price of Domino Printing Sciences, a manufacturer of ink-jet printers, yesterday fell 44p to 552p as the company issued a warning about its interim profits. It said sales growth had been insufficient to cover the cost of investment, mainly in the US. Mr Howard Whitesmith, managing director, said operating costs in the six months to end-April 1993 would exceed operating costs of Pounds 12.8m in the second half of 1992. He said, however, that profits would recover by the year end. However, 'unexpectedly slow' sales in the US in the first three months and sluggish business in Germany and the Netherlands meant sales would not outweigh 'planned investments'. Domino's share price has climbed 53 per cent over the past year. Gearing at the October 31 year end was 3.32 per cent and the net asset value was Pounds 48.2m. The group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.9m on turnover of Pounds 71.6m in 1991-92 with profits for the half year ahead 32 per cent at Pounds 4.54m. Linx Printing Technologies, a smaller competitor in the industry, confirmed the increasing value of markets outside the US and Europe. It said sales within that area had more than doubled in the six months to end-December 1992. The warning comes against a background of analysts' fears that growth will slow significantly in the industry because of a loss of the impetus generated in the 1980s by changes in EC consumer laws on such markings as sell-by dates.</p>

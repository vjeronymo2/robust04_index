			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / UK Company News: North American plastics activities boost Evode A STRONG performance from the North American plastics operations helped Evode, the chemicals and plastics group, increase pre-tax profits by 26.5 per cent for the six months to March 28. The interim dividend is maintained at 1.78p, which Mr Andrew Simon, chairman, said was a sign of confidence for the future. It was covered by fully diluted earnings per share of 1.9p (1.3p). Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 3m to Pounds 3.8m on increased sales of Pounds 141.9m (Pounds 137.8m), after eliminating the effects of divestments. There was a still a retained loss of Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 1.7m) after paying the preference and ordinary dividends. Operating profits from plastics, based mainly in North America, were up from Pounds 2.7m to Pounds 4.5m. Adhesives reported increased operating profits of Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 1.2m) as overseas companies mitigated the reduced industrial demand in the UK. Industrial Coating fell from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 200,000 because of a reduction in demand for architectural and industrial power coatings in the UK. Mr Simon said most European markets remained depressed. There was no tangible evidence in the UK to suggest that the recession may be coming to an end. The group deferred Pounds 400,000 of income from the pension fund in case the year's surplus was not as big as originally anticipated. COMMENT Evode shows how hard it can be to rebuild a balance sheet stretched by borrowings to fuel acquisitions. The recent sale of its shoe components business, bought as part of its protracted bid battle for Chamberlain Phipps in 1989, for Pounds 11.9m will help to reduce debt. But when the Pounds 23m of preference shares are subtracted from equity and added to borrowings - which is arguably where they should be - it does not look as significant as it might against gearing of close to 200 per cent. The group is doing all it can to eliminate costs - it made savings of Dollars 3m in the US - and has reduced spending to a minimum. For the half year capital expenditure is running at Pounds 1.8m compared to Pounds 9.4m for the end of the last financial year. With forecast earnings of Pounds 8.5m the shares - up 4p to close at 63p - are on a prospective multiple of 17.4. The 20 per cent premium to the market is only justified if the group produces significantly better full year results in 1993.</p>

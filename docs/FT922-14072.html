			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Delay to MCC pension payments NEARLY 1,000 pensioners of Maxwell Communication Corporation will have their next pension payment delayed for an indefinite period while the High Court decides how much money liquidators may pass to the pension scheme. Law Debenture Corporation, trustees for the MCC pension scheme, said yesterday that payments to pensioners since the company's collapse have now exhausted all the scheme's assets. The MCC scheme is entitled to a share of assets now controlled by Robson Rhodes, the liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management, which acted as fund manager to five companies controlled by the late Robert Maxwell. However, the Court must decide how to allocate those assets among five different pension schemes. While the Common Investment Fund, the assets of all the pension funds of the Maxwell company pension schemes, should have held Pounds 411m in assets, liquidators have been able to recover only Pounds 111m. Law Debenture and Robson Rhodes will ask the court to allow the administrators to provide a loan to the pension fund to pay the pensioners. Law Debenture also said yesterday it had successfully petitioned for a court hearing to establish the pension scheme's role as a creditor of the company  -a move initially opposed by Price Waterhouse, administrators to MCC. Creditor status would enable the pension scheme to benefit from any liquidation of MCC assets and reduce funds available to pay bank and other MCC creditors. Administrators win delay, Page 26</p>

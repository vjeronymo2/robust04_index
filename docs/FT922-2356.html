			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / US Names continue action NEW YORK lawyers acting for dissident US Names intend to appeal against a US court decision dismissing part of their action against Lloyd's of London. The case is the biggest of a series of actions brought by US Names who are alleging that Lloyd's, the insurance market, breached US securities laws when they were recruited. On Monday, Judge Maurice Lasker dismissed proceedings brought by 91 Names against 319 Lloyd's syndicates. The US district court judge ruled that the action could not be brought against the syndicates because they had no legal existence under English law. Syndicates are annual joint ventures, formed by Names, the individuals whose capital supports underwriting on the Lloyd's market. Ms Minna Schrag, of Prokauer Rose Goetz Mendelsohn, said the Names would appeal. Action against three other classes of defendants - managing agencies, members' agencies and Lloyd's itself - would continue. Each defendant has filed separate motions to dismiss the action. Although they are on a variety of legal grounds, all the defendants argue that, under the member's contractual agreement with the agent, disputes arising from membership should be heard under English law in an English court.</p>

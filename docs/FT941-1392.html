			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / People: Mr London The government's first regional director for London is to be Robin Young, the civil servant who has headed the Local Government directorate in the Department of the Environment since 1992. Young, 45, will spearhead the government's attempts to improve the administration of London in the absence of an elected body for the capital. From April 11, he will head the new single London office which brings together the regional offices of the departments of Trade &amp; Industry, Transport, Employment and Environment. Like the other nine regional directors, Young will be responsible for funnelling funds from these departments to the London region. He will also control London's share of the single regional budget, a pot of Pounds 1.4bn provided by the four departments which local authorities, Training and Enterprise Councils and other local partnerships will be invited to bid for. The London directorship will be at grade 2 (deputy secretary) level, in recognition of the importance of the post in implementing the Conservatives' election pledge to improve the co-ordination of government policy in London. Young joined the civil service in 1973 after education at Fettes College, Edinburgh, and University College, Oxford. He served as principal private secretary to three Environment secretaries between 1985 and 1988. In 1988, he was promoted to grade 3 (under secretary) with responsibility for policy on private sector housing and housing associations. He headed the environmental policy directorate 1989-91 and was responsible for preparing Chris Patten's white paper This Common Inheritance. He can be expected to provide forthright leadership for the new London Office: ministers have not always been happy with the high profile he has taken at the DoE.</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Letter: Quality and the environment Sir, I was struck by the tone of Bryan Cassidy's letter (January 30) which implied that cleaning up Britain's environment would make us uncompetitive compared with countries such as Japan and the US. A similar argument relating to product quality used to be popular in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, when it was claimed that quality costs money and that it was better to allow a proportion of defective output through because it was too expensive to engineer systems which produced defect-free output. In reality, it was shown that 'quality' production was cheaper and that customers rapidly understood where to purchase reliable goods. The environment argument is very similar; low pollution processes normally mean low waste, energy efficiency means lower waste and less initial fuel consumption. It is often found, therefore, that low pollution equates to low cost. Add to this the rapidly growing customer discrimination in favour of environmentally friendly goods and it is easy to see which countries will prosper and which will fail. The Japanese taught us a hard lesson on quality; let us show we have understood and applied it to the environment. P D Martin, Arjo Wiggins Crabble Hill, Dover CP17 0RU</p>

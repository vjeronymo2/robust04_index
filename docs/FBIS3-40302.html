Metropolitan Jovan was greeted by a large crowd of  worshipers  at the Church of the Transfiguration of the Lord in the center  of Zagreb. He returned for the feast of St. Sava, one of the  major holidays of the Serbian Orthodox Church.    The return of the Zagreb-Ljubljana metropolitan to his  residence in Zagreb after a two-year absence spent in Belgrade,  combined with visits to Ljubljana, has a deep meaning for global  Croatian-Serbian relations as well as for normalization of  relations following the signing of the Geneva Declaration by  Franjo Tudjman and Slobodan Milosevic. Metropolitan Jovan is a  Croatian citizen. He has a Croatian identity card and passport  that were recently given to him personally in Ljubljana by  Dalimir Vidis, an official of the Croatian Ministry of Foreign  Affairs, in the name of the Committee for Normalization of  Croatian-Serbian Relations.</p>

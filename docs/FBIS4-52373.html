			<p>BFN     [Text] The government has no intention of canceling its  purchase of Russian-made MiG-29 fighters even though Russia has  yet to adopt a clear stand on the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue.  Defense Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak said this to  reporters after the inauguration of the building housing UMNO's  [United Malays National Organization] Pramu Branch in Pekan,  Pahang. He said Malaysia should maintain its credibility, or  else other countries will certainly wonder whether future  decisions will be based on good practices or on some political  stand. He added that the decision to buy the aircraft stands  even though Malaysia is not pleased with Russia's position on  the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue. This is because Malaysia needs to  modernize its air force and strengthen its ability to defend the  nation's airspace.</p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Outspoken chairman quits HK company: Resignation of Jimmy Lai 'not connected' with virulent criticism of Chinese PM Giordano, the fashion retailer whose Beijing store was closed by China on Monday, yesterday announced the resignation of Mr Jimmy Lai, non-executive chairman. His successor, Mr Peter Lau, said the closure of the Beijing shop triggered Mr Lai's decision to quit. However, directors said there were no grounds to connect the closure with Mr Lai's virulent criticism of Chinese premier Li Peng in his popular weekly Next Magazine. 'In the interests of the company we would separate personal views from the view of the board. The board do not share Jimmy Lai's views; therefore we found it would be beneficial for him to resign,' the company said. Although widely expected, the departure has delivered a jolt to the business community in Hong Kong, by far the bulk of whom are engaged in activities on both sides of the border. For those who refuse to accept the coincidence of the Beijing shop's closure and Mr Lai's open letter to Mr Li, this is the first blatant instance of Beijing dictating to Hong Kong business. However, few are prepared to voice their fears publicly. Privately, a government official said: 'This is going seriously to worry the community here in Hong Kong if they think Lai was forced to stand down because of political reasons, because such an action would strike at the heart of Hong Kong's future autonomy in terms not only of freedom of expression but non-interference in commercial affairs too. And these are the twin bedrocks on which the success of Hong Kong has been built.' Announcing the board decision yesterday Mr Lau, chief executive, said: 'As far as the Giordano board of directors is concerned our primary responsibility is to all shareholders. If one (shareholder) happens to hold certain views which we may not think are beneficial to certain markets, then it is the directors' responsibility to bring this up in discussion with shareholders. 'As a non-executive chairman or as a shareholder who also holds an official position, I think the views he continues to express in his other businesses are not compatible at times with the markets that we operate in. The views he makes have no benefit to the company in these markets, and could hurt it.' The fate of voting rights - attached to his 36 per cent shareholding - was still under discussion with the securities regulator last night. Initial plans to assign all voting rights to three executive directors, including Mr Lau, were quashed by the Securities and Futures Commission as a breach of the takeover code, which stipulates that a transfer of a holding in excess of 35 per cent be accompanied by a general offer. One option is for Mr Lai to abstain at all shareholder meetings.</p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy In his Mansion House speech the chancellor asserts that he will need to exercise more judgment now that sterling has left the ERM. While that is patently true, it will not encourage the markets much. They took a pretty dim view of the government's judgment while sterling was buttressed by the D-Mark, and are disinclined to trust the unsupervised views of those who cried 'no devaluation' just before Black Wednesday. Nor will the proposed panel of expert forecasters prove a sufficiently robust policeman. As long as the exact recipe of Mr Lamont's nebulous inflation-predicting potion remains secret, investors are likely to regard it as snake oil. Given that credibility is badly damaged, the chancellor might hope to rebuild his authority with an accurate assessment of the current situation and a coherent policy framework for the future. Yet there are still worrying signs that Mr Lamont has not fully absorbed how much debt deflation is depressing the economy. True, base rates have been cut, but the US experience suggests they have to fall much further to ease debt-servicing pressures. The gilt market may take a little comfort from the chancellor's nods in the direction of balance between fiscal and monetary policy, and the need to guard sterling. But with the funding rule unchanged, the government will still have to sell more gilts next year than the total UK institutional cash inflow. In the circumstances it is hard to see long gilt yields remaining so close to those of French bonds.</p>

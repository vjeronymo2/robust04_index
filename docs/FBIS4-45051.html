			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Uzi Bar'am] </F>   [Text] The organization of some esteemed members of the  Labor Party into a group offering a third, alternative political  course is of interest and worth study. They contend that between  the "conservatism and close-mindedness of the right camp" and  the "capitulation of the left camp," there is another  possibility: the Alon plan.    Yig'al Alon conceived his plan in the late 1960's. It was  based on a chain of Jewish settlements in vital areas of the  occupied territories and on military control of the mountain  ridges. This plan, which early on won broad support in the Labor  Party, has now been pulled out of mothballs even though the  conditions that gave birth to it have changed.    If a genuine, bold and clearheaded leadership had arisen in  the early 1970's and opened a real dialogue with Jordan and the  PLO, it might have been possible to realize some elements of the  plan. Today, after the peace agreement with Egypt, which  included total withdrawal from Sinai, and given our readiness to  achieve a comprehensive peace with Syria--at the price that  entails--the Alon plan is no longer viable. It is now a  political corpse irrelevant to our times.    The simple, salient question before us is, are we ready to  make peace with Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and the Palestinians or  not. That is it in a nutshell. I am aware of the public's gut  feeling--peace yes, but not at any price. But the price is  clear: total withdrawal from the Golan, withdrawal from most of  Judea and Samaria except for Jerusalem, and the possibility that  a Palestinian state will arise as part of a permanent  arrangement. The compensation for that is a comprehensive peace  agreement with the confrontation states around us, with defense  arrangements acceptable to the military and security branches  and a different, optimistic outlook for Israel's future  development.    These are the only two paths before us: Greater Israel with  perpetual war and rule over another people, or peace with major  and painful territorial concessions.    The whites in South Africa could have worked out a shared  government and rotation in office with the black majority 20  years ago. The apartheid leaders closed their hearts and minds  and ended up with full control by the black majority, something  that could have been prevented by a wise and balanced approach.    In the basic elements of the dispute and in its solutions,  the case of South Africa necessarily is not identical to the  Middle East. But the comparison is applicable to determinism of  historic processes. Rule over a foreign people, even if it is  justified, has a price. Yesterday's price is not today's and  certainly will not be tomorrow's. Whoever tries to use  yesterday's plans today will pay the price tomorrow.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Airlines boosted by KLM European airline stocks were pulled higher yesterday by the overall strength in continental European bourses in general and excellent second-quarter results from KLM, the Dutch carrier, in particular, writes John Pitt. KLM, which announced a net profit of Fl 354m, at the top end of analysts' forecasts, saw its shares rise to a day's high of Fl 49.10, before easing back on profit-taking to Fl 48.00 for a gain of 70 cents. Meanwhile, Lufthansa, the part-privatised German carrier, advanced to DM194.10 in official hours, before adding a further DM1.40 in post-bourse trading to finish at DM195.50, as it announced that it was following the lead of other airlines by lifting cargo rates to the US by 5.9 per cent from next year. Mr Chris Avery, aviation analyst at Paribas Capital Markets, commented that the KLM figures showed that the airline was making good progess in reducing costs. He said that he would be raising his full-year forecasts following an analysts' meeting with the company. The figures from KLM, he added, showed that both cargo and passenger operations had done well, while the reduction in fuel costs had clearly been beneficial. As long as operating costs continued to be trimmed, he said, there was no reason to be other than bullish regarding prospects. Lufthansa, in particular, had plenty of potential for cost-cutting, he remarked.</p>

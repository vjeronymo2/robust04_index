			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jesus Garzon for the "TV Today" newscast] </F>   [Text] Just when the government thought the scandal over  the U.S. forces' presence in Juanchaco had ended, the State  Council exercised its constitutional authority and unanimously  demanded an explanation from President Cesar Gaviria concerning  the Marines' presence. The State Council president said Gaviria  did not violate the Constitution if he had the Senate's  approval; otherwise, he is in a serious situation.    President Gaviria has until 8 February to tell the State  Council the truth about the U.S. forces' presence in Colombia  and the overflights of U.S. aircraft on the country's northern  coast. The 26 magistrates will then meet to study the situation  and decide whether the Colombian president violated the  Constitution.    For the time being, it is known that neither the Senate nor  the State Council have been consulted by the government to allow  the transit of U.S. soldiers through Colombian territory.    [Begin recording] [State Council President Amado Gutierrez]  If the Senate has given its authorization, then he would  obviously have no problem.    [Garzon] The Senate said no.    [Gutierrez] That is what we have to establish. [end  recording]    According to the State Council, this is the first time a  Colombian president has been questioned in connection with the  presence of foreign troops in our country without prior approval  from the Senate.    [Begin Gutierrez recording] There is no precedent for a  State Council's ruling to allow the transit of foreign troops in  the country. [end recording]    Therefore, in order to decide President Gaviria's  culpability  or innocence, the State Council expects to learn from the  government under what conditions the permit was issued.[end  recording]</p>

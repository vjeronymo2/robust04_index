			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Minister quits in Portugal Portugal's junior minister for employment and training, Mr Antonio Pinto Cardoso, has resigned after the attorney-general's office began an investigation into allegations of his involvement in the suspected misuse of European Social Fund money. The minister's resignation is an embarrasment for the centre-right government of Mr Anbal Cavaco Silva, which prides itself on a reasonably honest record in using EU funds. It will also fuel controversy over alleged corruption in the use of social fund money. Mr Pinto Cardoso said in a statement that he had not been accused of any wrong-doing but was resigning to protect the good name of the government and to help investigators discover the truth. A Portuguese newspaper said yesterday officials were investigating a Es126m (Pounds 504,000) subsidy awarded by the employment ministry for the launch of a magazine publicising ESF-funded training courses. The report alleged that the subsidy was made from Portuguese government and ESF funds, with Mr Pinto Cardoso's knowledge but without approval by the European Commission. The attorney-general, Mr Jose Cunha Rodrigues, and the head of Portugal's judiciary police, Mr Mario Mendes, on Thursday briefed a parliamentary commission on the progress of investigations into several cases of alleged misuse of ESF funds. Mr Cunha Rodrigues said afterwards that he expected several important cases to come to court by the end of 1994. Officials are investigatiing more than 400 cases of alleged misuse of ESF funds. So far, only 21 have reached the courts. Investigators complain of a lack of resources. Controversy over spending of ESF funds for training has been simmering for several years. Allegations of misuse of funds were the subject of an inconclusive parliamentary inquiry in Portugal last year. The European Commission said yesterday it had not given its agreement to finance the project in question and had not transfered the money to the Portuguese authorities. 'We will investigate further,' said a commission spokeswoman.</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (1): Resistant to change - Japan's asset-price bubble has burst, eroding profits and relegating expansion plans to the shelf. The country's financial institutions are under great pressure, but they will still play an important role internationally CREATING THE right impression is important in Japan. The cutbacks in staff, the branch closures of brokers and banks, and the life assurers' angry demands for better returns on shares give the intended impression that much is changing in financial Japan, and that institutions are finally accepting the need for a broad restructuring. But after three years of plummeting stock prices and the collapse of the property market the most remarkable characteristic of Japan's financial markets is the resistance to seemingly inevitable change. The players have yet to accept that the new financial conditions mean that they must redefine the old relationships and reform their old ways. There are even signs that the Japanese government, moving gradually towards more transparent and competitive markets over the past decade, has allowed the stock and property crash to divert attention from these goals. 'Administrative guidance' (the often opaque missives from the finance ministry) is coming back into fashion, and policy decisions appear increasingly designed to serve the interests of institutions - not investors. Relationships on the financial fringe have changed. Banks are less likely to lend to customers outside their core clientele, and some fringe corporate customers have sold off bank stocks. But the relationships at the centre remain relatively stable, and the life assurers have yet to act on their repeated threats to dump low-yielding shares. However, the longer the share market and corporate profits remain weak, and the larger the pile of non-performing loans, the greater the pressure for changes to these core relationships. A surge in stock prices earlier this month gave leading banks and brokers the impression that the worst may be over, but the possibility remains that the real restructuring of financial Japan may only just be beginning. Gauging the depth of Japanese institutions' difficulties is not easy. Banks are being encouraged by the Bank of Japan to write-off non-performing loans, but the Y12,300bn declared by the 21 leading commercial, trust and long-term credit banks in September is far from their total exposure. It does not include the increasing burden of loans on which interest rates have been shaved down to 0.5 per cent, nor loans on which token payments are made to get round the definition of non-performing - no repayments within a six month period. And it does not necessarily include the problem loans of affiliates. Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan governor, admits 'there is no quick remedy' for the non-performing asset problem, and the 'process will be accompanied by a certain amount of pain.' He recommends that banks show more individualism, offering distinctive services and writing-off bad loans in line with their ability to absorb losses, not in line with their competitors. 'Each financial institution needs to escape from its conventional management stance of doing the same as its competitors,' Mr Mieno says. Conscious of international attention on capital adequacy standards, Japanese banks have boosted their ratios by taking on subordinated loans and issuing perpetual subordinated bonds; both improve the raw figures without the pain of structural adjustment. All leading institutions will be above the 8 per cent minimum applying at the end of this month, but these figures will flatter the less profitable banks. 'Restructurings' overseen by Japanese banks are also, sometimes, not what they seem. This was highlighted by a dispute this month between Azabu Building, a 'bubble era' developer, and its main bank, Mitsui Trust and Banking. The bank last year provided the developer with a new president and managerial staff supposed to reassure other creditors by reducing Azabu's Y700bn in debts through the disposal of properties. Azabu Building presumed that the operation would be a time-biding 'restructuring", with properties shuffled around to friendly companies or affiliates on the understanding that they would be repurchased by Azabu when the crisis passed. But, as an Azabu official put it, 'Mitsui Trust was trying to sell too much,' prompting the developer's founder to dismiss the president and the other Mitsui staff. Japan's brokers are also yet to make the deep cuts necessary to ensure their profitability at the present market turnover and stock price levels. Not one of the 14 largest brokers reported a net profit for the first half to the end of September, and apart from a sudden surge in mid-March, prices and turnover have continued on a downward trend begun in December 1989. The Big Four brokers - Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities - are closing retail boutiques opened in shopping centres and railway stations during the late 1980s, and cutting staff through attrition. But they still need an average daily turnover in Tokyo of about 400m shares, approximately double the level of recent months. Of the 10 second-tier brokers, only those with close links to the still powerful Nomura appear strong enough to survive without a complete overhaul. These houses have made deeper cuts than the Big Four, but the knife must go deeper still, as they are more reliant on trading commissions, which account for as much as 80 per cent of their income. The stock market's continuing weakness raises the question of what other funding sources can be tapped by industrial companies. (They are lucky that the life assurers are looking to return to their traditional role as lenders to industry. Mr Yutaka Tanaka, managing director of finance at NKK, the steel maker, claims to have had little difficulty in finding Y220bn this year to refinance Dollars 700m in warrant bonds issued in December 1988, and another Y130bn in convertible bonds from July 1989. He chose bond issues in the Euromarkets, and says his confidence came out of his belief that 'with issues maturing, people have to find some new investment.' Other large and respectable companies have turned to the domestic bond market, where there were 40 issues totalling Y1,680bn in the fiscal first half, compared to 63 issues at Y2,423bn for all of the previous year. But the market remains heavily regulated, and the power utilities, which had the market to themselves until the 1980s, still account for about half of the issues. A sign of the pressure on small companies was a decline in lending by second-tier regional banks during February for the first time in five years. The Regional Banks' Association blamed decline on lack of demand, but it also reflects the unwillingness of banks to fund new corporate customers. International companies are also finding Japanese banks more cautious. An Asian confectionery manufacturer, having signed a lucrative contract to supply a Japanese retail chain, told of a meeting with officials at a Tokyo-based commercial bank which seemed to approve a loan - but a call next day made it clear that no funds would be available. That introversion is in contrast to the internationalism shown by Japanese financial institutions during the 1980s. Another worrying sign is the finance ministry's willingness to return to the wink-and-nod relationships which tended to exclude institutions outside the inner circle in Tokyo. Convenient rule changes - allowing life assurers to count unrealised profits on their stock portfolios as income, and permitting banks to defer write-downs of overvalued assets - seek to give the impression that the worst of the crisis is over. Long-heralded reforms to demolish the wall between banks and securities houses have been delayed.</p>

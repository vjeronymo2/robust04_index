			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Zhu Yuquan (2612 3768 3123) and TIANJIN </F> RIBAO reporter Wang Hong (3769 1347)]    [Text] Tianjin, 1 Apr (XINHUA) -- Li Tieying, member of  the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and state councillor,  pointed out during his inspection of the preparatory work for  the 43d world table tennis championship in Tianjin: To host  well the 43d world table tennis championship is the work of the  whole country, not just the work of Tianjin. The entire society  should be concerned about and support it and make it show  Chinese characteristics, world standards, and the Chinese  people's sports style of the 1990's.    Li Tieying inspected the Tianjin stadium under construction  on 31 March. He was accompanied during the inspection by Xu  Zhijian, deputy secretary general of the State Council; Wu  Shaozu, minister of the State Physical Culture and Sports  Commission; and Zhang Lichang, mayor of Tianjin Municipality.  They held an on-the-spot business meeting in a simple work shed  on the construction site and listened to a briefing of Tianjin  on the preparatory work for the 43d world table tennis  championship.    Li Tieying said: China successfully hosted the 26th world  table tennis championship in 1961. After 34 years, Tianjin  Municipality will host the 43d world table tennis championship.  We must carefully plan, scientifically organize and  meticulously direct such a major world competition. We must  make the championship a grand, lively and spectacular event, as  well as a complete success. Its success will be of great  significance to promoting China's sports, economic construction  and building of the spiritual civilization, as well as to  further enhancing our international image. The State Council  will go all out to support Tianjin in hosting well the 43d world  table tennis championship. All departments concerned,  provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities should  coordinate all the activities like pieces in a chess game and  contribute to the success of this major international  competition.    Li Tieying emphasized: The 43d world table tennis  championship will provide Tianjin a stage for performance, and  the 9 million Tianjin people have a glorious and yet heavy  responsibility for performing well on the stage. Tianjin  Municipality should take it as an opportunity to make major  progresses in comprehensive urban management, appearance of the  city, public order, and spiritual civilization, to promote the  city's reform, opening up, and modernization, to make itself  more famous in the world, and push itself onto the world.    Li Tieying pointed out: In hosting large-scale sports and  cultural activities, we should adhere to the principle of both  striving for spectacle and complete success and practicing  economy. We should advocate participation by all, free service,  and voluntary work. We should form a contingent of volunteers  for the world table tennis championship, integrate the  preparatory work for the championship with the building of  socialist spiritual civilization, and strive for success in both  the sports competition and the spiritual civilization.</p>

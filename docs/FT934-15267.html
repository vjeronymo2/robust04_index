			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Oakley extends Somalia peace mission MR Robert Oakley, the US special envoy to Somalia, is to extend his stay in Mogadishu following an encouraging two days of talks aimed at breaking the impasse between UN peacekeepers and Somalia's rebel warlord, Gen Mohammed Farah Aideed. 'Mr Oakley will probably remain in Somalia until Thursday due to positive signs emerging from his meetings,' Mr Stephen McIlvaine, the US charge d'affaires in Mogadishu said yesterday. But confusion remained over what President Bill Clinton's special envoy hoped to achieve. Statements from Washington did not clarify whether the US wanted Gen Aideed behind bars for the killing of UN peacekeepers, or whether they wanted to cut a deal with the fugitive general to end his guerrilla war in Mogadishu, in which 70 UN soldiers have died. 'Anything Mr Oakley said could be misinterpreted,' Mr McIlvaine said. 'But he is not dealing with Aideed and he is not competing with the Unosom (the UN Operation in Somalia).' Mr Oakley's meetings have been shrouded in secrecy but he is believed to have met members of Gen Aideed's Haber Gedir clan. Mr Oakley, a former ambassador to Somalia, is said to be respected by the Haber Gedir, having obtained US visas for many of those who were persecuted under the Siad Barre dictatorship. He has also held consultations with the UN's top man in Somalia, Admiral Jonathan Howe, and the Italian ambassador, Mr Mario Scialoja. The latter said he was 'in perfect agreement' with Mr Oakley's mission, but refused to spell out what this was. Mr Farouk Malawi, the UN spokesman in Mogadishu, also sought to play down policy differences between Washington and the United Nations. 'There is co-ordination and full understanding of Mr Oakley's mission,' he said yesterday. Nevertheless, Mr Oakley must be under orders to secure the freedom of the US helicopter pilot seized by Gen Aideed's militias during last week's bloody gun battle in which 15 US soldiers and more than 200 Somalis were killed. A Nigerian peacekeeper is also being held hostage. Mogadishu's war-weary residents have greeted the intense diplomatic activity and Gen Aideed's offer of a ceasefire on Sunday, with great relief. 'I need peace, bread and a job,' says Ahmed Mohammed, who worked for a British hydro-engineering company before the civil war. He now scrapes a living selling his services as an interpreter. Even this brief interlude without fighting has allowed a semblance of normality to return. Children's voices could be heard across school playgrounds yesterday afternoon. Traffic jams piled up outside the port, where lorries waited to load rice, maize and cooking oil for distribution around town. Pick-up trucks, which once carried militias and mounted guns, were ferrying passengers. 'Of course we know that the ceasefire is temporary, that it could blow up again any minute,' says a UN official. 'But morale has definitely picked up since Oakley's arrival. Both on the UN and the Somali side.' But Mr Oakley's mission is being interpreted by Gen Aideed's rivals as a policy of appeasement towards the man who defied the United Nations. 'Other clans are getting restless,' says another UN official inside the heavily-fortified Unosom compound. 'They are even getting angry. They don't want the US to build Aideed into a strong opponent. If he is granted too many concessions, it may complicate the UN's relations with other clans.' But after four months of increasingly bloody warfare, both UN and US officials are seeking a way to end the fighting. The risk is that Mogadishu may be flooded with too many diplomatic initiatives. Apart from Mr Oakley, Ethiopian and Eritrean diplomats are also in town trying to mediate an 'African solution' - currently gaining favour in Washington - as a convenient way to disengage from the Somali quagmire. Mr Koffi Annan, UN under-secretary general for peacekeeping operations, is also in Mogadishu, and Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the UN secretary-general, is expected to arrive this week.</p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Markets: Gilts also go to the ball - London The equity market made the headlines this week, with the FT-SE 100 index passing briefly through the 3,300 mark for the first time on Thursday. Smaller stocks did even better: as the chart shows the FT-SE Mid 250 index, which measures the performance of the next-largest 250 companies, has again resumed the pattern of outperformance seen earlier this year helped this week by big dividend rises from a clutch of regional electricity companies. But the rally in the gilt market was almost as spectacular. Long term interest rates in the UK have fallen roughly half a percentage point in the last month: ten-year gilts, for example, are now yielding less than 6.4 per cent, compared with nearly 6.9 per cent a month ago. The traditionally volatile equity market has risen 5 per cent since the day before the Budget. Long-term gilts, usually much more stable, have risen 2 1/2 per cent in the same period, as measured by the FT-Actuaries fixed-interest index. The contribution of the gilts rally to the rise in share prices can best be measured by looking at the yield ratio, which divides the yield on long-term gilts by the yield on equities. (It is now printed daily alongside the FT's London stock market report.) The lower the ratio, the 'cheaper' the equity market in relation to gilts. Just before the Budget, the yield ratio was 1.93; it is now 1.95. So, though equities have got slightly more expensive on this measure over the period, much of the impetus behind the share price rally has come from gilts. Domestic and international investors sensed that, in the Budget, the UK government got a handle on the medium-term outlook for public borrowing. Salomon Brothers, surveying the outlook for world securities markets in a new report this week, singles out the UK as the only one of the major European economies which has begun shifting policy towards sorely-needed fiscal restraint. If such sentiments are shared elsewhere around the world, they perhaps explain the enthusiastic reception given to the year's last gilts auction, which was heavily oversubscribed on Tuesday. The next day, the markets rallied further, as investors reacted to hints from Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, that another cut in short-term interest rates was likely early next year if economic growth faltered. George did not seem to feel a slowdown was likely: he said that the chancellor's expectation of 2 1/2 per cent gdp growth next year was 'plausible', a rare tribute to the beleaguered band of Treasury forecasters. Perhaps more important, however, he played down the risks of a rise in inflation. The Bank is set to be an increasing influence over interest rate policy - George revealed that it has been given a month's leeway in deciding the timing of rate cuts instigated by the chancellor. His tone suggested that, for the foreseeable future, it is unlikely to bring the full weight of its influence to bear on the side of monetary restraint. In anticipation of further cuts in interest rates, bank stocks were again among the biggest gainers this week. Securities firms have also gained: their employees are looking forward to big bonuses this Christmas. One influence here is the record trading volumes for November, announced by the London Stock Exchange on Tuesday. UK equities worth Pounds 52.6bn were traded in the busiest month since July 1987, at the peak of the boom that ended in a market crash that October. The scale of the gains showed this week in the interim results of one publicly quoted securities firm, Smith New Court, which reported interim profits up five-fold to Pounds 31.3m. Prompt profit-taking pushed the shares down 11p down on the day. But the closing figure, 411p, was nearly double the 210p at which the firm made a two-for-seven rights issue in June. The City has made so much money this year - not just because of trading volumes but because of consistently high levels of activity in all the various aspects of its business. Corporate financiers, suffering earlier this year from a shortage of lucrative takeover bids, have been able to rejoice in modest activity. These include the first serious hostile takeover bid for a franchised television company: as the world expected, Granada joined the rush to consolidate the ITV system by bidding for LWT. Although valuing the target at Pounds 600m, the bid was a pinch-penny one: at closing prices on Monday, the day it was announced, the six new Granada shares offered for every five LWT shares were worth 582p, a discount of 0.5 per cent to the target's pre-bid share price. For shareholders who would prefer cash, the deal was even less generous: it included a cash alternative of only 528p. Still, as Gerry Robinson, Granada's chief executive, said the offer was half as high again as the LWT share price on June 28 when Granada first bought a stake in the company. The holding now stands at 17.5 per cent, large enough to cause problems to any potential white knight - which perhaps explains Granada's confidence in its relatively low bid. LWT shares closed the week at 592p, 3.2p below the value of the Granada offer. The Granada bid, together with the previous week's agreed bid by Carlton for Central, marks a new era in British television. New eras were in ample supply this week, though not all were so much to the liking of shareholders. London International Group, famous for its condoms, also promised a new era. Alas, this version included interim losses, 'very substantial' restructuring charges, plans to sell large parts of the business, a passed dividend, and the imminent departure of Alan Woltz, its non-executive chairman. Nothing had prepared investors for the scale of the bad news. The shares closed the week at 117p, down 31p.</p>

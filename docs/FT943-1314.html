			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Savers must wait As the dust settles after the base rate rise, long-term fixed-rate products continue to flourish: Cheshire building society, for instance, has introduced a bond paying 9 per cent until December 12 1999. Escalator bond rates also continue to rise. But savers hoping their income from everyday accounts will be improved may be disappointed. Of the high street banks, only Barclays has moved to increase rates to savers - on average, by the full 0.5 per cent. When rates fell in February and banks were able to pay savers less, the rates were changed much more quickly. But it is usual for bank savings rates to rise or fall in line with the base rate change, and rises can be expected eventually. This is not the case with building societies. With the rise in base rates, mortgage rate increases have been announced relatively quickly. The average rise at present is 0.4 per cent, immediate for new loans and from the beginning of October for existing borrowers. The few savings rates that have been announced are up by an average of only 0.2 per cent and, again, these will be paid from the beginning of October. Most societies are waiting for the bigger players to make a move on savings rates and will then follow. In any case, delaying an increase in savings rates means they will be collecting more interest from mortgages than they are paying out on savings. If, however, building societies do delay rises in savings rates and then increase their margins, returns from National Savings will start looking more competitive.</p>

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / UK Company News: New management takes over at Young Group NEW SENIOR management of Young Group officially takes charge of the coal mining company following its annual meeting today, clearing the way for the business to be refocused on its core activities, identified as opencast and underground coal mining and haulage, with an eye to opportunities likely to arise in British Coal's privatisation. Mr Joseph Stevenson, recently appointed non-executive chairman-elect and Mr Brian Calver, group managing director-elect, have started a review aimed at overcoming working capital problems which led to the recent financial restructuring, but have declined to state which non-core activities might be sold. The review has a 'certain urgency', said Mr Stevenson, as Young wants to exploit privatisation opportunities. After today's meeting Mr Bob Young, a miner's son, will cease to be chairman and chief executive of the Durham-based company he founded in 1970. His departure from the chair was agreed in April as part of a restructuring which gave the group an additional Pounds 2.4m overdraft facility. He will become non-executive vice chairman, advising on marketing strategy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Zagreb by Nada al-Isa] </F>   [Text] The Croat-Serb agreement is still causing disquiet.  The Croatian opposition is still not clear about the conditions  under which it was signed or what has happened to the maps --  there were 35 on the table. There have been no offical  statements on this from the Croatian side. They are keeping  things concealed as best they can.    However the Zagreb press has published a map reprinted from  the Vienna-based paper DER STANDARD and the borders on the map  are shown in such a way as to give any Croat a headache. For  example, the so-called republic of Serb Krajina has outlets to  the sea at Biograd and Zadar, but what tops it all, the papers  say, is that even Osijek is in the so-called Krajina. Is the  leadership really concealing such a thing from ordinary people?    President Tudjman also has different political problems  every  day. The replaced Josip Manolic has announced that he is off to  Washington as early as today where he is to have talks with U.S.  congressmen responsible for military issues. The meeting has  allegedly been fixed up by Dobroslav Paraga. So Manolic is not  travelling to Washington with Tudjman's blessing. Who is he  representing? What is behind the visit? Those in the know say  that Dr Tudjman himself would like to know the answer to this  question.</p>

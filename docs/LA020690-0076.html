			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FATHER OF FUGITIVE BOY SEEKS GUARANTEE  </P> <P> The father of a 16-year-old boy suspected of shooting two deaf brothers refused  to meet with Los Angeles police Monday to discuss turning in his son.  </P> <P> Joey Bellinger remained in hiding Monday evening after his father failed to  show up for a scheduled interview at the Devonshire police station to discuss  the Jan. 28 murder of Cesar Vieira, 30, and the wounding of his brother Edward,  25, in Granada Hills.  </P> <P> The fugitive's father, Joe Bellinger, 40, has said he is in contact with the  boy, but that he will not turn him in until authorities promise to try him as a  juvenile. Police have refused to make such an agreement.  </P> <P> "This is my son's life," Bellinger said. "I'm doing everything I can to see  that the truth is brought out."  </P> <P> Police said they will not arrest Joe Bellinger for harboring or aiding a  suspected felon, although they believe they have grounds to do so. "That would  only push him underground," said Detective Michael Brandt. "The point is to get  the kid surrendered before he hurts anyone else."  </P> <P> The elder Bellinger has gone to extraordinary lengths to defend his son,  including embarking on a five-day hunger strike and arranging media interviews  at his Long Beach home Sunday with a 17-year-old girl, who told reporters she  witnessed the shooting of the two deaf brothers. The girl's version of the  story, which depicts Joey as firing on the two men in self-defense, differs  from that of the surviving brother, who told police the youth fired without  provocation after forcing the brothers' motorcycle off the road.  </P> <P> Police have declined comment on the girl's story but confirmed they have  interviewed her.  </P> <P> Monday, Bellinger produced for reporters a 15-year-old boy who said he also was  in the car with Joey and witnessed the shooting. The boy, who said he  understands sign language, claimed Joey acted in self-defense, and that the  deaf brothers were belligerent and made no attempt to communicate before the  shooting.  </P> <P> Brandt said police have interviewed the youths in the car, but "no one in the  car understands American sign language. The father is just trying to cover his  son's trail, that's all."  </P> <P> The boy later told The Times that, although he was interviewed by police, they  did not ask him whether he knows sign language.  </P> <P> This is the second time the Bellinger family has appeared in the news. Three  years ago, the body of Joey's older sister, Michelle, 16, was found stuffed  into three plastic bags on a hillside in the Silver Lake district, her hands,  chest and ankles bound with duct tape. The elder Bellinger dogged the  investigation. He drove the streets of Silver Lake and sat on hillsides with  binoculars, searching for a car that a friend of Michelle said might have been  involved. Even after a 15-year-old boy was arrested and convicted in the  killing, Bellinger continued his search for what he believed were others  implicated in his daughter's death.  </P> <P> Residents in the Fairfax district neighborhood, where the Bellinger family  lived at the time, say Joey's behavior changed for the worse after his sister's  death. He dropped out of high school with his father's permission and became  known in the neighborhood as a troublemaker.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the family's former landlord said Joey's behavior caused the  family's eviction from their Fairfax apartment late last year.  </P> <P> Neighbors said Joey is the head of a youth gang dubbed KAOS, an acronym  borrowed from the television series "Get Smart," which for the gang stood for  Kids Against Our Society.  </P> <P> Detective Joe Lumbreras of the West Bureau's anti-gang unit said Monday that  KAOS was known to police as a "wanna-be gang of white youths who probably used  narcotics and believed in racial segregation." Lumbreras said the group of  youths was primarily known for defacing the Fairfax district with graffiti.  </P></p>

			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Dispute looms on bank watchdog THE BRITISH Bankers' Association said yesterday that it still had severe doubts about the wisdom of extending the banking ombudsman scheme so that incorporated businesses can complain to the ombudsman about banking mistakes. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is expected to announce in the next day or two that Mr Laurence Shurman, the ombudsman, should be allowed to adjudicate on complaints from small businesses. At the moment only unincorporated businesses and individuals can use the scheme. A dispute between the banks and the chancellor is likely over which incorporated businesses should be allowed to use the scheme. The government's intention is to provide a complaints mechanism to small businesses, but finding a definition of a small business acceptable to the banks is proving difficult. The reform to the ombudsman scheme will be part of a package of measures aimed at forcing banks to improve their services to small businesses, following widespread complaints that banks are treating these customers insensitively. The ombudsman scheme can only adjudicate on banking errors. Mr Lamont is therefore likely to urge the banks to improve their internal procedures for handling complaints from customers of unfair treatment by appointing internal ombudsmen. These would be able to examine the most common form of complaint from small-business customers, that banks have unfairly changed the terms and conditions of a loan or other bank ser-vice. Mr Lamont is likely to clear the banks of levying excessive interest rates on small-business loans, although he may question whether bank charges are being increased too much in some cases.</p>

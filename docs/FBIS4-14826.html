			<p>BFN     [Text] At parliamentary hearings on the pace of land reform  in Russia, the Federation Council's and the State Duma's  Agrarian Committees rejected the program on agricultural reform  for 1994-1995, endorsed by the government on March 31.    In the opinion of participants in the debates, the plan  drawn  up by the agriculture and food ministry "could at best be an  agricultural policy concept as it falls short of specific  recommendations for better farm production."    They argued that an agricultural development program last  "at  least until 2000" and indicate not only guidelines and stages of  reform but also "concrete results" that Russian farmers could  achieve if the plan succeeded.    A statement adopted at the end of the parliamentary hearings  recommends that the National Agricultural Academy and  agriculture and food ministry put the final touches to a federal  program on measures to carry out agrarian reform, restore and  develop agro-industrial production by the year 2000, worked out  by a group of experts led by ex vice-president Aleksandr Rutskoy  in early 1993.    The cabinet was asked to submit the rehashed variant of this  program for debate in the parliament's lower and upper houses by  May this year.</p>

			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> HITCHHIKERS OF THE LABOR FORCE;  </P> <P> DAY WORKERS PUT UP WITH A LOT FOR A COMPARATIVE LITTLE  </P> <P> Marcos Chicuate Castro toes the curb, tracking the whizzing cars with a  seasoned eye, flinging his right arm out when a truck passes or he catches a  driver's attention.  </P> <P> A white GMC truck pulls into the gas station across the street, and the driver  lets out a shrill whistle. Castro and half a dozen other men sprint across the  street to where the truck is parked.  </P> <P> Someone else gets the nod, and Castro crosses back to his spot at Kester Avenue  near Victory Boulevard in Van Nuys. It is 8 a.m., and he has been on the  lookout for a job for about half an hour.  </P> <P> Castro comes as often as six days a week to the site, which laborers call Las  Piedras (The Rocks). Strangers pick him up and take him to building sites,  homes and warehouses to garden, clean or paint.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hinges on Variables  </P> <P> Like thousands of other day laborers on Los Angeles streets, whether he gets  picked up depends on many factors -- such as the weather, the construction  business, and his audacity and speed.  </P> <P> His earnings have ranged from $100 to $250 a week. But despite the fact that  most people would have a hard time living on such meager wages, the 25-year-old  Castro, in the United States illegally, is upbeat: "It's a gold mine here. If  you're patient, you'll be able to get something," he said in Spanish through an  interpreter.  </P> <P> Although he sleeps on the floor of a cramped apartment, has no car and longs  for his family in Mexico, jobs are more plentiful in the San Fernando Valley  than where he came from.  </P> <P> Castro is tidy in black jeans, with two gold chains tucked inside a red  pullover jacket; his mustache is neatly trimmed and he wears a baseball cap. He  smiles sincerely when he has a job prospect.  </P> <P> Gumption, he said, is the key. As other workers told him when they introduced  him to the day-labor system, "Whatever they tell you they need, you say you  have experience doing it. When you get to the job, you watch the other workers,  and you just do it."  </P> <P> He looks at a woman who's driven up to a liquor store and market along Kester,  takes a hesitant step toward her, gets no response and retreats. "Sometimes  it's better if you approach them," he said, because employers would be  embarrassed to beckon someone who turns out not to be offering work.  </P> <P> A woman about 55 years old pulls up in a white Buick. She rolls down her window  and smiles; the men, including Castro, surround her car. Three jump into the  back seat. "Just need three," she tells the others.  </P> <P> Although about 10 prospective employers stop for workers on this day, Castro is  not lucky enough to land a job. He calls it quits about 11:30 a.m.  </P> <P> But Castro is not worried. A few weeks ago, a North Hollywood resident who owns  a refrigeration supply company hired him. Since then, he has been assembling  refrigeration products and painting the man's house for a few days each week.  If employers like your work the first time, "sometimes they'll come back and  look for you," Castro said.  </P> <P> Spurred by a breakup with his fiancee and dreams of seeing "Disneylandia,"  Castro left the fishing village of Sinaloa and crossed into the United States  in May, 1986. In Mexico, he was training to work for a fishing cooperative and  lived with his fisherman father, mother and six siblings in a four-bedroom  house.  </P> <P> He took a bus to Tijuana, where a coyote led him and three other men across the  border to San Ysidro about 3 a.m. He and the others hid from the searchlights  of U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service helicopters as they made their  way north.  </P> <P> One of the men had a friend in Panorama City, who let Castro stay at her home  and invited him to help her sell marijuana. Castro said he did not know about  day-labor opportunities and had looked for work, but employers kept demanding  documentation. He said he finally agreed to peddle marijuana on Blythe Street.  He made $200 to $500 a day.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sent Money Home  </P> <P> He sent money home, telling his parents that he worked in a restaurant -- and  feeling guilty about the lie. In the summer of 1987, he was arrested by Los  Angeles police, who found 6.2 grams of marijuana in his possession. Out on  $5,000 bail, he returned to Mexico with a duffel bag of dresses, Reebok shoes  and toys for his brothers, sisters, nieces and nephews.  </P> <P> In his village, though, he yearned to return to the United States. Los Angeles  "is more of a rat race, but you can get what you want faster. . . . Right away,  you can get all the things you need -- TV, apartment."  </P> <P> He tried to cross back to the United States, got caught, tried again and  succeeded in early 1988.  </P> <P> Still guilt-ridden about lying to his parents, he said he decided to give up  drug dealing. New friends took him to Victory and Kester. His first day, he got  a job mixing stucco at a Studio City house.  </P> <P> But in November, police recognized him on Blythe Street and hauled him in. He  pleaded guilty to his prior felony drug charge, possessing marijuana for sale.  After serving three months of his sentence, he was released on probation.  </P> <P> The conviction probably blocks any opportunity that Castro might have had to  live in the United States legally, said Antonio Rodriguez, a lawyer at the  Latino Community Justice Center in Los Angeles. But even without a criminal  record, Castro may not have fit into a category that would have made him  eligible for legal status -- he has no relatives who are permanent residents or  citizens, is not a farm worker, does not qualify for amnesty and has no  specialized skill for which there are not enough American workers, Rodriguez  said.  </P> <P> But Castro said he paid $300 to someone he knows as "an attorney," who told him  it would take five months to obtain citizenship. The man told The Times that he  was not an attorney but worked for one and refused to give more information.  His phone has since been disconnected.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prospects Dim  </P> <P> Castro did not seem worried that his prospects for citizenship are dim. He said  he has paid for his crime and plans to continue going to Las Piedras to seek  work.  </P> <P> The going rate along the street is $5 an hour, and Castro said he will work for  less. But he and other workers said men who haven't worked in a few days are  desperate and will take whatever they can get.  </P> <P> One homeowner, Castro said, wanted two men to clear away the torn-down walls in  a Ventura Boulevard house that was being remodeled. Once at the house, the  homeowner said he would pay each man $20 for an 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. workday.  </P> <P> "Can you imagine that? Two dollars an hour," Castro said. The employer refused  to pay more, drove them back to Kester Avenue in Van Nuys and picked up others,  he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sometimes Unpaid  </P> <P> Castro said he was once cheated on an asphalt repair job. The foreman said the  boss would pay, but he never did. Castro said he is owed about $50. But, he  said, taking the time to pursue the lost wages would mean a day away from the  street and potential loss of more wages.  </P> <P> When he's not working or looking for work, Castro visits friends, strolls the  Panorama City Mall or along Broadway downtown, or watches TV at home -- a  $475-a-month studio apartment in Van Nuys that he shares with an older man  nicknamed "Tio" (uncle) and two teen-age boys. Castro said the teen-age  brothers arrived from Ensenada two weeks ago and one of them -- using false  papers -- recently landed a job. Castro and Tio have been splitting the rent.  </P></p>

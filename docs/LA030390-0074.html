			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANNENBERG TO GIVE $50 MILLION TO BLACK SCHOOLS  </P> <P> In the largest single donation ever to black higher education in the United  States, publishing magnate Walter H. Annenberg said Friday that he has pledged  $50 million to the United Negro College Fund.  </P> <P> "Unless young blacks are brought into the mainstream of economic life, they  will continue to be on the curbstone," Annenberg, the 82-year-old former  ambassador to Great Britain, said in a telephone interview from his Rancho  Mirage estate. "The key to this problem is education."  </P> <P> The gift was to be announced formally on Sunday by President Bush during his  weekend stay at the Annenberg estate, where he and Japanese Prime Minister  Toshiki Kaifu are holding economic and trade talks.  </P> <P> Annenberg said his gift will be a challenge grant to form the basis of what the  UNCF hopes will be a $250-million capital campaign. He said he would be giving  the money in phases during "the next five or 10 years," as the fund reaches  step-by-step goals toward the other $200 million.  </P> <P> "Black colleges have got to be supported," Annenberg added, urging that his  challenge grant be matched from other sources. "The entire country has to get  behind this. Foundations, corporations and private citizens. We can't just  leave this for the government to do."  </P> <P> The Annenberg grant tops the previous largest gift to any black-oriented school  or educational program -- the $20 million given by actor Bill Cosby in  November, 1988, to Spelman College in Atlanta.  </P> <P> And the gift comes at a crucial time for the fund, which aids 41 historically  black colleges throughout the nation and gives scholarships to deserving  students. The declining enrollment of black students, particularly black males,  at all American colleges in the past decade has caused much alarm. In addition,  the financial condition of some black colleges, including many small  institutions in the South, has become precarious.  </P> <P> "Words cannot do justice to my feelings of gratitude," Christopher Edley,  president of the fund, said in a statement prepared for Sunday's ceremony,  according to the Associated Press.  </P> <P> Annenberg, the former owner of TV Guide and other publications, has been one of  the nation's strongest supporters of higher education. His $3-million gift to  USC brought his total donations to the college's recent fund-raising drive to  $26.5 million and put the university over the top in its $567-million fund  drive. The USC School of Communications bears the Annenberg name, as does a  similar school at the University of Pennsylvania.  </P> <P> The United Negro College Fund was established in 1944 and has since raised more  than $650 million for its members. The fund estimates that the average  endowment of its institutions was $6,710 per student in 1987 compared to an  average of $19,918 per student at primarily white institutions.  </P> <P> While the Annenberg pledge is enormous, it is not the largest in general higher  education. That spot is held by Robert W. Woodruff, former chairman of the  Coca-Cola Co., who gave $105 million to Emory University in Atlanta in 1979. In  1986, David Packard, co-founder of the Hewlett-Packard Co. electronics firm,  pledged $70 million to Stanford University and his partner, William Hewlett,  gave $50 million to the university.  </P> <P> Annenberg served as ambassador to Great Britain from 1969 to 1974. He joined  his father's company, Triangle Publications, in 1928 and developed it into a  successful publishing firm. He founded Seventeen and TV Guide magazines and in  1957 bought the Philadelphia Daily News. His father's firm had previously  acquired the Philadelphia Inquirer. In 1988, he sold Triangle Publications Inc.  to Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. for $3 billion.  </P> <P> Annenberg said Friday he was particularly alarmed at the rise of gangs among  black youths in the nation's cities.  </P> <P> "Do you want the gangs you have in Los Angeles to continue endlessly? Maybe  this will be the start of the end of that," he said, referring to the increased  scholarships and college recruiting that his money will help buy.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Glenn Bunting contributed to this story.  </P></p>

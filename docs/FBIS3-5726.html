In the past three months prior to the  inauguration of the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge the government  and the private sector have worked to turn the border into a  special economic area and set up industrial estates in several  border provinces.    Regarding security, there has been rapid reorganization as  well as readjustments to border operations to suit the  development trends in the northeast. The cabinet has approved  the National Security Council proposal to set up the Border  Policy Implementation Center under the directorship of the  supreme commander. Instructions have also been given to the  Army, the Army Regions, including the Second Army Region which  oversees 19 northeastern provinces.    The Second Army Region was instructed on 3 March to  establish  a management center for the border provinces under its  jurisdiction. The center will operate within the framework of  peaceful resolution of border disputes and the avoidance of  violence, relying first on the local mechanism. It will  accelerate the settlement of border disputes, while the  relations with the neighboring countries are good and will  protect interests of the local people.    According to Lieutenant General Anuphap Songsunthon,  commander of the Second Army Region, his command has issued  instructions for the establishment of the Thai-Lao Border  Command Centers and the Thai-Cambodian Border Command Centers.  The governors of the border provinces will head the centers.    The Thai-Cambodian Border Command Centers will be situated  in  four provinces -- Ubon Ratchathani, Sisaket, Surin, and Buriram.  Their main objectives are to serve the Thai private sector in  trade and investment in Cambodia and protect their interest.  They will not support any Cambodian faction, tolerate the  existence of foreign forces in Thai territory, or the violation  of Thai sovereignty. They will drastically suppress activities  of foreign armed bandits by setting up check points and  operating rapid deployment units. It will cooperate with other  units to suppress the smuggling of contraband, arms, and  vehicles.    The Thai-Lao Border Command Centers will be set up in Ubon  Ratchathani, Loei, Nong Khai, Mukdahan, and Amnat Charoen  provinces to support legitimate border activities and  drastically suppress illegal trading. They will promote  relations between local elements and cooperation to peacefully  solve border problems.    Anuphap stressed that after the friendship bridge opens the  objectives of the policy will remain the same but will emphasize  the strengthening of ties at the local level as well as  promoting the use of the bridge for contacts between Thailand  and Laos.    The establishment of the centers at various levels by the  security establishment amounts to the military's support of the  government's policy and the policy's expansion to broaden  contacts between Thailand and Laos and Cambodia to benefit trade  and investment, while maintaining national security and avoiding  disputes by the use of local mechanism.    The establishment of the command center in each province  amounts to adjustment of the province's conduct toward the  neighboring country. The operational staff of the Second Army  Region is drafting the details for the center operations for the  regional commander to sign into formal centers quickly.    Regarding the protection of important economic areas,  Anuphap  asserts that there is no security problem in the Second Army  Region because the main forces of the army are already located  there. There is no need for new deployment of weapons for the  region. Investors can be confident in the Second Army Region.    The above preparations by the security establishment to open  the northeastern region to Indochina are an important step in  facilitating investors. They amount to a new chapter in  cooperation by the Thai military from its previous posture of  aggressive solution of border problems. This adjustment has  given investors greater confidence.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 13 (AFP) -- The Chinese government  officially confirmed Wednesday that dissident Xu Wenli, detained  last Friday in Beijing, is free. "Xu Wenli has complete freedom  of movement," a Public Security Ministry spokesman told AFP by  telephone. The spokesman said "Xu has been free since Saturday  after being held legally for 24 hours." But according to  relatives, the dissident was only released Tuesday.    Xu, 49, a leader of the 1978-79 Democracy Wall movement and  one of China's longest serving political prisoners, had been  detained as part of a police sweep of dissidents in Beijing and  Shanghai that coincided with the visit of French Prime Minister  Edouard Balladur.</p>

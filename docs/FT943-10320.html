			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Rotork increases by 11% to Pounds 6.89m Rotork, the valve control manufacturer, lifted pre-tax profits by 11 per cent from Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 6.89m in the six months to June 30, helped by the group's global coverage. Mr Tom Eassie, chief executive, said this was 'our salvation always', adding that not less than 70 per cent of Rotork's output was exported. Turnover rose 21 per cent to Pounds 41.3m (Pounds 34m), though Mr Eassie explained that some Pounds 5m was derived from new activities, in particular Exeeco, bought in the second half of last year. Group operating profits expanded almost 16 per cent to Pounds 6.63m (Pounds 5.74m), while interest and similar income contributed less at Pounds 260,000 (Pounds 460,000). Sales and profits in the actuation division, which accounts for some 80 per cent of turnover, both rose over last time, though Mr Eassie said that the domestic UK market - and especially the water companies - had been disappointing. He suggested that, although the utilities had freely spent in the past couple of years, they had 'been sitting on their hands' in the period under review. With the K factor issue now settled, he expected expenditure to rise. Of the buoyant markets, the most 'exciting' had been east Asia, South America and Canada, he said. The IQ range was continuing to sell well 'in a tightening market', leaving the group room to move more into the system controls side. Markets for the instruments division, whose products feed into the actuation side, were 'not promising', though the final quarter looked brighter. Turnover here was between Pounds 6m and Pounds 7m. The analysis, or pollution monitoring, division was trading at break-even. Earnings per share rose 11 per cent to 5p (4.5p) and the interim dividend is increased by 8.6 per cent to 1.9p (1.75p). The shares closed down 2p at 164p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Filenko, Ukraine people's deputy, </F> chairman of the board of the Party of Democratic Renewal of  Ukraine: "Who Does Not Learn from Other Revolutions Will Get His  Own"]    [Text] This is not malicious rhetoric but an unfortunate  fact: in the years since independence life in Ukraine has  worsened. The eternal philosophical question "How to Live?" has  turned for many of our compatriots into a desperate query: "How  to Survive?"    Two years ago Ukraine inherited a total general crisis.  Along  with independence, the Ukrainian people got an opportunity to  live by their own wits. How did they use this opportunity?    The Soviet Union disappeared from the map two years ago;  yet,  we still have a part of the Soviet economic system, not yet a  Ukrainian economy. Production is not geared toward Ukrainian  resources and needs but toward making output which we do not  need from raw materials and components which we do not have.  This is why without a radical structural overhaul of the  Ukrainian economy based on its resources and needs we will  neither be able to provide a normal life for the people nor  achieve complete independence for the country. Nor will a  structural overhaul be enough in itself. We must stop the  printing press which churns out money.    This reminds me of the comic play "The Wedding in Malinovka"  and its colorful character, Popandopulo the Financier. He is no  miser: on the contrary, he pays readily with the money which he  himself prints, repeating: "Go ahead, take it; I can draw myself  new bills." It seems that the monetary policy of the National  Bank is based on the same principle.    While irresponsible emission weakens the karbovanets, the  use  of hard currency in domestic transactions renders it totally  useless. Until Ukrainian money becomes the only legal tender in  Ukraine, the talk of stabilizing Ukrainian finances will only  serve to disguise anti-Ukrainian financial policies. I am not  proposing to restore the Iron Curtain or bring back xenophobia:  since the exchange of currency is an integral part of a normally  functioning economy, how come there are stores all over Ukraine,  where Ukrainian money is not accepted?    An integral part of the current financial policy is the  fixing of the dollar exchange rate by the National Bank. In  general, it is normal to have fixed exchange rates. In Poland,  for instance, it is one of the most important components of  Balcerowics' brilliant stabilization plan. Nor does it matter  what level the exchange rate is set at, as long as it is a rate  of exchange (i.e., of free purchase and sale), and not  confiscation. How else to call the compulsory exchange of one  half of their hard currency earnings imposed on enterprises?  And, to make sure that they could not make up their losses by  selling the rest of their hard currency at the currency  exchange, the exchange has now been shut down.    Money, both foreign and domestic, has a bad luck in Ukraine.  Both experts and officials at every level have talked so much of  new money being printed, or already printed, that monetary  reform became unavoidable. Expectations of it in Ukraine as well  as abroad are so strong that from the psychological point of  view the karbovanets can no longer be stabilized. How to  stabilize a currency that has lost all credibility and whose  replacement is expected from one day to the next?    The optimal solution would be to introduce the hryvna in  parallel with the karbovanets and then to withdraw the latter  gradually. Perhaps other methods would turn out to be better.  But should this candy-wrapper game go on? The choice is up to us.    Simple replacement of one kind of paper with another would  not be of any use. The proper effect would be achieved only by  coordinated monetary and banking reform in the context of  general economic reform. What is needed is a two-level banking  infrastructure with the National Bank at the top level and a  broad network of flexible, independent, mainly private  commercial banks at the lower level.    The hryvna may be brought into circulation from the start as  freely convertible within Ukraine. Creating the hard currency  stabilization fund to support the exchange rate is a feasible  task, if it is given the highest priority.    However, the stabilization fund will be exhausted quickly  unless there are goods that the hryvna can buy. Until the engine  of the market economy starts humming, it could be mainly real  estate and land. There is no reason to fear: privatized land  plots will not go anywhere from Ukraine but will be utilized  more efficiently--including also by those who band together into  cooperatives.    Our state is not poor, it is rich. It is the Ukrainian  people  who are poor. The state owns 90 percent of all property: the  land, the raw materials, the factories and the  stores--practically all of Ukraine. This enormous wealth is not  traded (at least not legally); it has been artificially  withdrawn from the market and is not tradable.    Since there is a shortage of goods for sale, prices go up,  inflation increases and money quickly loses its value. It is not  profitable to invest into long-term projects which are necessary  to establish new enterprises, restructure existing ones and  effect a structural overhaul--in short, to develop production.  As a result, money is either spent in retail trade, where it  turns over quickly, or is siphoned abroad, where business  conditions are much more favorable. In Ukraine, meanwhile,  inflation, combined with the decline of output, is turning into  stagflation.    In these conditions, privatization is the greatest  anti-monopoly factor. State monopoly, on the other hand, makes  it possible to hike prices without shame and with impunity. The  domination of the state sector in the production of consumer  goods and retail trade means a harsh choice between an orgy of  price hikes which we see today and low prices with a gradual but  inexorable withdrawal of goods from legal trade which we had in  the past.    Private production and trade mean sufficient quantity  of goods and socially acceptable prices, whereas state  production and trade result either in out-of-this-world prices  on down-to-earth goods or in low prices on nonexistent goods.    Some 2,000 years ago, in his treatise "On Duties" Cicero  wrote as though it had long been obvious: "It is important that  people use public property as public and private property as  their own." Thousands of years have passed. Today's bureaucrats  have grown accustomed to managing public property "in the name  and on the behalf of the people," which means totally without  accountability. If we take into account that they control land,  residential and commercial real estate and plenty of other  property, it would become clear that a gold mine is like nothing  compared to what the bureaucrats have. Combined with a variety  of permits, licenses and limitations, excessive state power  becomes the foundation for abuse and corruption. This is why the  black market is the only one that flourishes and constantly  grows in Ukraine.    Privatization will move great quantities of goods from  the black market to the legal one. There is no better cure from  both inflation and corruption.    Ukraine is not yet democratic, but it is no longer  totalitarian. People can talk, hold rallies and strike.  Employees of the state sector can now press their demands, which  are both reasonable and, at the same time, unrealistic. People  think that the state, if it only wished, could satisfy  everybody's demands.    Similar problems exist in France, Italy and other countries.  This clearly shows that a market economy, democracy and a large  state sector are incompatible, because a great temptation arises  to seek improvements in the living standard not in accordance  with economic development but by means of non-economic pressure.    In the West, the low point was reached during miner strikes  in the 1970s in Great Britain, which in a large measure brought  about the replacement of the Labor government by the  Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher. The problem was  solved radically and efficiently: by privatization. As a result,  the living standard in Great Britain increased considerably,  including that of workers, and especially that of miners.    For the same reasons privatization was effected in the  Canadian province of British Columbia, in Australia and in New  Zealand. Privatization is going on in France, Germany, Sweden  and Italy. And in every country of the former USSR. Except in  Ukraine.    These examples lead to the following conclusion: mass  privatization has a major positive impact, both immediate and  indirect. This is not a concession to fashion, nor another  imported idea, but a deliberate step toward healing the economy.  This is why the Party of Democratic Renewal of Ukraine (PDVU)  advocates rapid, large-scale privatization of both small and  large enterprises.    However, privatization alone will not suffice. We also need  new, competitive enterprises. This is why privatization must be  complemented by the urgent development of private enterprise,  most importantly of the small and medium market segments. We  have talked often enough of the back-breaking tax burden that  law-abiding entrepreneurs cannot afford, but cause for complaint  has not diminished. I have already mentioned the fact that the  state takes 50 percent of hard currency earnings, paying almost  nothing in return. I could mention many other examples of how  private enterprise is being pressured, but what for? Questions  whether the state creates favorable conditions for economic  initiative or inhibits it, or whether it protects citizens from  bureaucratic and criminal extortion or encourages it, seem  rhetorical.    Nevertheless, given the lack of favorable conditions for  business activity of the population, these are the questions of  survival. There could have been instructions hanging everywhere  on how to open and manage a private business, whereas organizing  assistance to beginners could have become top priority.    The main goal of a private enterprise is return on  investment, or profit. The state, on the other hand, has a  different set of priorities. A state entrepreneur is above all a  servant of the state. His goal is to do what is best for the  state and for his career, not business considerations. A private  enterprise is much more efficient than a state one. This has  been proven by historical experience and is clearly illustrated  by the living standards of the people in the Free World.    Since the Iron Curtain has fallen, only those who do not  want  to hear do not know this. Social Democratic parties, after  coming to power, traditionally carried out nationalization. As a  result, a sizable state sector exists in the West. But they have  become convinced that this is harmful and have revised their  programs radically. Now they advocate strong social security  systems within the confines of the free market economy.    Rich people do not exist only in America: they exist  everywhere where there is money. They existed under Stalin's  orthodox socialism and under Brezhnev's developed socialism;  they exist today, too, while socialism is on its death throes.  But only the market economy helps create a large class of  proprietors, the third estate. In developed countries it has  become the majority of the population. It is comprised of  businessmen and farmers, teachers and doctors, scientists and  skilled workers.    Prosperity does not fall from the skies like manna, nor does  the middle class appear out of nothing, as though by magic. It  is built up gradually, with diligence and hard work. Neither the  Europeans nor the Americans have always had the kind of standard  of living they enjoy today. Nor do all countries with a market  economy prosper yet. There is no ideal, but there are decent  examples and, therefore, hope. The living standard in countries  which combine the market economy with a multiparty parliamentary  system is considerably better than in any other social structure  that humanity has known.    Availability of goods, a large middle class and the  fruits of the market economy are the guarantees of stability and  dynamic, harmonious development of society.    Lack of energy and raw materials and irregularities in  foreign commercial relations, primarily with Russia, are a  reality. But how important can this be when gas, water and other  valuable resources are squandered without control and the energy  intensity of production in Ukraine exceeds considerably the same  indicators in France, Germany and Denmark?    The insistence that external factors are the main cause of  our problems is empty talk, substitution of the root causes of  our economic crisis with other, less important ones and an  attempt to shun responsibility for our own shortcomings.    Our state is not poor, our country has not been cursed with  a  poor climate and our land is fertile and has other resources. It  is not Ukraine that is resource-poor; it is Iceland that lacks  resources and is but a volcanic island battered by the winds.  Yet, its per capita income is a little higher than in the US.  Denmark is a country perched on dunes; yet, its people live so  well that only after a second attempt they were persuaded to  approve the Maastricht Treaty. The Japanese also live well.    The wonder is not that we live poorly but that we are alive  at all. We live poorly because government leaders have bad  policies which do not encourage people to work but to beg,  demand and steal. Why do we have such policies?    Of course, there is plenty of incompetence and lack of  professionalism. The traditional brain drain to Moscow and lack  of experience governing a country and not a province and poor  professional education under the Soviet regime all have had  their impact. Moreover, a Soviet economist and an economist are  not the same thing; nor is it always clear which impulse in the  leadership would win over: that which comes from the experience  of management or of destruction.    But above and beyond all these factors, the fact is that the  ruling elite implements the kind of policy it wants. Ukraine is  not ruled by little kids but by rational human beings who make  conscious decisions and consciously accept their obvious,  foreseeable consequences.    There is no need either to discover America, or to reinvent  the wheel, or to seek out a nonexistent program for a quick and  painless transition to a living standard similar to that of  Sweden or even of Greece. The fundamentals of the true market  economy, which are in the main identical in Japan, the EU and  the US, are well-known. So are the blueprints for accelerated  development of Third World countries and for the transition of  socialist economies to the free market. Not only are they  well-known, but they have been tested in practice, as  continuously proven to work in Europe, Asia and Russia. Problems  do arise, but the ultimate success of such policies is already  clear--in those countries where they have been adopted.    In Ukraine, on the other hand, laws on the privatization of  small and large enterprises that were passed a year and a half  ago have not been implemented yet. State privatization programs  for 1992 and 1993 were deliberately sabotaged. The same is true  of the Cabinet of Ministers' decree on the privatization of  backyard and dacha plots for 1993.    Are the authorities ignorant of this? Or perhaps they lack  the ability? No, it is desire that they lack. Property  without proprietors, business without businessmen allows them to  combine without accountability the license of an owner with the  lack of responsibility of a hired hand. If you can live like  this you do not want to change anything.    But it can not go on like this. Privatization is  unavoidable.  Life and economic necessity will gain the upper hand. Everybody  understands this. Preparation for large-scale privatization goes  on. In a rather unusual way, however. Transition to a corporate  structure, breakup of large enterprises, buyouts and  commercialization go on slowly and in some cases only  superficially. But, at the same time, busy replacement of signs  and the establishment of pseudo-market entities and small  enterprises in the state sector that live off state authority go  full-steam ahead.    On the one hand, this is a way to transfer public funds and  even property into private pockets and, on the other, a seizure  of advantageous starting positions which, once mass  privatization has been declared, would automatically lead to the  transfer of better properties into privileged hands.    Based on this scenario, mass privatization would formally  begin only after the de facto privatization of highly  profitable properties has been completed. There are many tasty  morsels, and it takes time to share them out. Privatization is  being delayed while the lion is getting ready to leap.    Those who are willing to learn can learn a lesson from  history: whenever the people realize that property is being  distributed unfairly there is trouble. In 1961, the Russian  Emperor granted the serfs freedom without land. The outcome is  well-known.    Since the majority of the population have been excluded from  privatization and have no chance of acquiring their fair share  of national (and not state) property, none of the leaders will  be able to sleep or to conduct business in peace. Freedom  without property is a time bomb placed under the privatization  process as well as under the economic future of the country. The  specter of communism roams Ukraine. Who does not learn from  other revolutions will get his own.    This is why the best possible method of privatization is the  one that is most fair. Such would be a free distribution of a  major portion (more than half) of property among all  proprietors, i.e., all Ukrainian citizens. Some maintain that  this would mean forced privatization, or collectivization  backwards. It is correct. Collectivization was robbery.  Distribution among the people would be restitution of stolen  property. Indeed, collectivization backwards.    Today, this approach is used sparingly and altogether  insufficiently. Sum total of privatization--K1.050 million--is  clearly too little and the list of targets is too short, while  there are few enthusiasts and information about the program is  being disseminated poorly. We should learn from Russia or,  better still, the Czech Republic, both how to popularize and  explain vouchers and to offer a variety of opportunities for  making use of them.    The people of Ukraine do not suffer from market reforms but  from their absence. Not only are market reforms not implemented;  they are being systematically discredited. Partly revised and  partly monopoly prices are now called free prices, the ongoing  theft of property privatization, massive fraud entrepreneurship  and the whole thing market reform. In this way, people feel  anger and hatred toward the market, reform and reformers.    Instead, we hear calls for a state of emergency in the  economy and for responsible commissions, committees, etc. There  is no need for any such steps. We have had a state of emergency  in the economy for 70 years, as well as its advocates in power.  Ukraine needs the opposite: a normal economic system and a  normal, competent government formed by a normal, politically  accountable parliament.    From this emerges the key aspect of our differences:  politics. Economic reform is the function of power. The hope  that it could be implemented by a group of professors of  economics is a pipe dream. If those who have political power  (the parliament and the president) want reforms and delineate  their general direction, specialists will have the  responsibility to work out the needed programs and legislative  agenda, and administrators to carry them out.    Collectivization was not carried out by peasants or by  experimental economists, but by Bolshevik leaders. The economic  miracle in postwar Germany, achieved under the direct leadership  of Economic Minister Erhard, had been first sanctioned by the  Allied occupying powers and strongly supported by Chancellor  Adenauer and the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social  Union in the Bundestag. Growth in the US and Britain in the  1980s was spearheaded by the political will of Ronald Reagan and  Margaret Thatcher and their cohorts.    The most important precondition for reform is the  election of a reformist parliament and a reformist president,  and the formation of a reformist government.    Can this be achieved in the coming elections? It can, but by  accident. The majority in the existing Supreme Council, which  only pretended to carry out reform and was busy discrediting it,  made sure that the incoming Supreme Council was the same. To  this end, it passed the old election law, making it worse. The  elections will be held on a non-party basis, which means that  the voters will be voting for individual deputies, not for a  specific political line, politicians or policy.    Existing democracies have several forms of election laws.  But  they all are meant to establish a parliament whose members are  divided into party factions. The majority party forms the  government and is therefore responsible for the chosen policy.  On the line are votes in the next election. By assessing  election platforms of the parties and comparing them with recent  past, the voters have a clear framework for deciding for whom to  vote.    This does not, and cannot, exist in a non-party election in  which candidates represent no organized political force or  tradition. Political connections and true intentions of  so-called independent candidates are all too often concealed and  come out only when they are already in the Supreme Council.    Multiparty elections are a way to achieve a functional,  well-structured and responsible government, while non-party  elections are a way to create a politically anonymous,  irresponsible Supreme Council.    Success does not come in a day. Western countries reached  prosperity only after they combined the market economy with a  multiparty democracy. The same process is now under way in  countries which only recently were living under dictatorship,  such as Spain, Portugal, Chile and South Korea.    It is not an accident that the Supreme Council, whose policy  has been to impede market reforms, has chosen as its political  priority the path of sabotaging a multiparty system. It would be  naive to hope that a Supreme Council elected in this manner,  whatever its composition, would improve our living standards. As  long as supporters of economic and political democracy remain  divided and disorganized, the party in power will continue to  pursue its line, accompanied by vile demagoguery.    In short, economic and political reform can only be blocked  due to the weakness of its supporters. The only way to be  respected is to become strong, and the only way to do so is to  unite. A club of like-minded people is a good idea but it is not  enough. A voter club is also a good idea, but it is not a  lasting one. We need permanent, stable organizations of  citizens: parties. Do not wait for favors from above--they are  not forthcoming. Unite instead.</p>

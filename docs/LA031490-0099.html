			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NFL MEETINGS;  </P> <P> OWNERS CHANGE RULES IN HOPE OF SHORTENING GAMES TO THREE HOURS  </P> <P> The NFL owners, still following where Commissioner Paul Tagliabue leads, made a  new effort Tuesday to shorten the overall time period of their 60-minute game.  </P> <P> This is one of the new commissioner's priorities. An average NFL game last  season ran 3 hours 11 minutes, which was, in his view, much too long.  </P> <P> "(The NFL) needs a three-hour game," Tagliabue said. "And the action we took  today will move us in that direction."  </P> <P> The action:  </P> <P>  -- The clubs voted to pare NFL halftimes from 15 minutes to 12.  </P> <P>  -- And they voted to save another five or six minutes by getting the game  clock going sooner in selected situations.  </P> <P> A football clock doesn't run continuously. It is stopped when, for instance,  the ball goes out of bounds, or when a penalty is called, or after kickoff  returns.  </P> <P> And for years in NFL games, it hasn't been restarted until the center snapped  the ball to the quarterback for the next play.  </P> <P> To save time this season, the game clock will be restarted when the referee  gives his familiar ready signal -- instead of on the snap -- on three kinds of  occasions: after a player goes out of bounds, after a declined penalty and  after kickoff returns.  </P> <P> The only exceptions, the NFL decided late Tuesday, will come in the final two  minutes of the first half and the final five minutes of the second half.  </P> <P> In another change, the 30-second clock will become a 25-second clock this  season, matching the time allowed for college teams to put the ball in play.  </P> <P> Tagliabue appointed a new realignment-expansion committee to go to work on one  of the league's most difficult problems.  </P> <P> It is a committee of the whole -- consisting of the chairmen of the league's  top committees -- plus Tagliabue, who said he will be the chairman of the  chairmen.  </P> <P> "Traditionally, the NFL has expanded two cities at a time," Tagliabue said. "I  would expect that we'll add two teams within two years or so, giving us 15  teams in each of two conferences, with five teams in each division."  </P> <P> Realignment, however, will not come until at least 1994, and it hasn't happened  since 1969, when Pete Rozelle settled the infighting with a blind lottery.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH AND ASSAD  </P> <P> Why does our President meet eagerly with the Syrian head of state, our former  enemy, Hafez Assad, instead of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, our former friend?  </P> <P> Hussein, for all the wrongs he may have done, has shed no Yankee blood, whereas  Hafez Assad has been accused of master-minding the terrorist attack on the  Lebanon Marine headquarters that killed 241 American Marines.  </P> <P> Might it not be more to the point and far less costly if Bush and Hussein could  share a meal together and talk turkey? It wouldn't be as spectacular as Bush's  well-staged desert extravaganza on Thanksgiving Day, but it might be more  productive, especially if both leaders would give a little to gain a peaceful  settlement.  </P> <P> Surely both men are smart enough to know that war gains nothing but loses  lives, dollars and the very property they are trying to save.  </P> <P> ALBERT JOHNSON  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

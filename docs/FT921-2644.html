			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Election '92: Kinnock awayday runs on time THE DAY began terribly, with the Red Rose Express pulling out of Paddington Station two minutes early. Mr John Prescott, Labour's transport spokesman, who positively thrives on late trains, did not look best-pleased. He was left to wave disconsolately as Neil and Glenys Kinnock departed on their awayday electioneering trip to Bristol, the first formal campaign outing for a leader whose party promises, among quite a lot of other things, to make the trains run on time. The transport-secretary-in-waiting might have perked up a bit when Labour's chartered train temporarily ground to a halt outside Temple Meads Station. But it was to be the last hitch of the day. If the party's 1987 campaign was the slickest failure in modern political history, this one is hell bent on being an heroic, hectic success. With every second and every picture made to count, the Kinnocks made straight for Staple Hill Primary School in the Kingswood constituency of Mr Robert Hayward, the Tory MP who has a fight on his hands to hold on to his 4,000 majority. The sight of the leader of the Opposition, not to mention the promise of a specially extended playtime, brought big cheers from the toddlers who proudly showed off their school. Passing a live, pop-eyed stick insect, curiously christened Gerald, the Kinnocks made straight for the library where they read and sang with the children. Neil, who explained that Glenys was a teacher 'in real life', was told by Gary, aged 7, that his dad liked him best. Daisy, 6, threatened to blot her copybook by confiding: 'I always thought that you were pretend.' This, however, is deadly serious stuff. On to the Downend Day Centre for the handicapped and a hall full of painting, knitting, weaving Bristolians trying to rise above the media chaos suddenly enveloping them. Neil quickly waxed lyrical about old Archie Kinnock, his granddad. who came from Bristol but went to live in south Wales when he missed the last boat to America. 'I'm the result,' he chirped. The entourage swept back past Gerald and on to the Red Rose Express for high tea and a quick spin back to Ealing Broadway, conveniently round the corner from chez Kinnock. Watch out for Mr Prescott's InterCity, door-to-door weekly saver. It's a certain vote-winner.</p>

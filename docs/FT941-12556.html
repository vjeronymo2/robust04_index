			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / UK Company News: SelecTV rises to Pounds 0.6m SelecTV, the USM-quoted independent television production company with successes such as Birds of a Feather, Lovejoy and Love Hurts, yesterday announced a jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 278,000 to Pounds 614,000 for the half year to September 30. Increased production activities helped turnover rise from Pounds 6.4m to Pounds 13.7m. Directors warned, however, that the first half performance would not continue through the second half as fewer programmes were being completed for delivery to broadcasters. Earnings per share were 0.29p (0.19p).</p>

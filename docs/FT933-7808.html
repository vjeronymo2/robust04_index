			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: SCA For a paper company to contemplate increasing capacity again is a real act of faith that the market has turned. Swedish investors clearly believe as much, having bid up their paper sector by 1.3 times since last October. But the signs are not all positive and it will take time to soak up current overcapacity. Significantly, SCA's new machine in the UK will not come on stream until 1995. The company's move may also reflect structural considerations as much as cyclical ones, as Nordic producers shut capacity in home markets and open mills using recycled pulp closer to end users. Timing paper cycles is certainly tricky, as Fletcher Challenge - which yesterday wrote down the carrying value of UK Paper by NZDollars 229m - will doubtless confirm. Hence SCA's caution in considering sharing the project with South African investors. They, in turn, may have the additional temptation of parking funds offshore. But if things really are turning the paper industry's way, this may be dispiriting news for others. UK newspapers have benefited greatly from the 30 per cent fall in newsprint prices since 1989. If that trend reverses itself, advertising revenues remain sticky and the spectre of VAT materialises, newspapers' margins could be painfully squeezed.</p>

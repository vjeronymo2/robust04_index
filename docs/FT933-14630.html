			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesia's withdrawal from gas field talks may be tactical THE INDONESIAN government has withdrawn from negotiations with Exxon Corporation of the US over the Dollars 20bn development of the Natuna gas field in the South China Sea. The move may, however, only be a tactical ploy with the field remaining central to the future of Indonesia's liquefied natural gas industry. General Ida Bagus Sudjana, the energy minister, told local journalists of the surprise decision last week whilst visiting oil facilities in East Kalimantan. He is reported to have described Exxon's proposal as 'inefficient and unprofitable to Pertamina', the state-owned oil and gas company. Exxon has a 50 per cent stake in the field with Pertamina holding the remainder. Pertamina has since confirmed the decision but an Exxon official in Jakarta denied negotiations were now dead. 'We are currently in conversations with Indonesia on this matter,' he said. The Natuna field has 40 trillion (million million) cubic feet of proven and probable reserves and could produce 14m tonnes of LNG a year, worth about Dollars 2.4bn to Indonesia. Divisions between the Government and Exxon apparently centre on how production is shared with both parties demanding more than half the field's output. Government officials say Exxon is also insisting on a concessionary tax regime and a sovereign guarantee for its investment covering force majeure risk. Industry officials believe the two parties will end up back at the negotiating table. While the Government had earlier warned it would consider other partners, Exxon is considered one of only a few companies with the expertise and capital to develop the field. Natuna's high cost stems from the technical difficulties in separating the natural gas from an estimated 70 trillion cu ft of carbon dioxide. The field would take eight years to bring on stream, entail more than 700,000 tonnes of offshore platforms and nearly 1,000 km (620 miles) of pipelines. The field's economics may be marginal but industry officials say Indonesia needs to develop Natuna to maintain its dominant position in the world's LNG industry. The country exported more than 22m tonnes of LNG last year to Japan, Taiwan and South Korea but 12m tonnes was produced by Pertamina's Arun plant in North Sumatra, where reserves are running low. New reserves have been found in Kalimantan and the completion of a sixth unit and other improvements will boost production at Pertamina's Badak plant in East Kalimantan by 40 per cent to 14m tonnes by 1995. Badak's higher output is unlikely, however, to be sufficient to roll over long-term export contracts, which begin to expire in 1999.</p>

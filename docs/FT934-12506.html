			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / International Bonds: Dealers anticipate issues from Swedish borrowers TWO large international bond issues from Swedish borrowers are likely to emerge today when the Kingdom of Sweden raises at least Dollars 1bn through an issue of three-year global floating rate notes (FRNs) and Urban Mortgage Bank of Sweden (UMB) raises Dollars 500m through an offering of five-year Eurobonds. Sweden's FRNs, via Lehman Brothers and JP Morgan, are expected to be priced at a small discount to par and carry a coupon of three-month Libor minus 1/8 point. UMB's Eurobonds, via Nomura, are likely to be priced to yield 68 basis points over the when issued US treasury due 1998. Some syndicate managers said the two issues effectively offered investors a broad yield spectrum on Swedish government debt, since UMB is backed by SKr27bn guarantee fund from the government. Among yesterday's issues, the European Investment Bank tapped investor demand for short-dated Eurolira paper with its L500bn issue of three-year Eurobonds. Joint lead manager IMI said that investors were reducing their exposure to the long end of the yield curve and were re-investing their profits in the shorter end. The EIB kept the proceeds of the issue in fixed-rate lira but hedged itself against any fall in Italian interest rates over the next four months by entering a 'spread-lock' or a 'delayed rate settlement' agreement with IMI. IMI said the agreement offered mutual compensation to both parties because it also protected IMI against a rise in rates during the four-month period. EIB's bonds had a re-offer price of 99.88 to yield 52 basis points below the 9 per cent Italian government bond due 1996. When the bonds were freed to trade they were quoted at 99.75 in line with underlying weakness in European bond markets. Elsewhere, the development of an international fixed-income market for Hong Kong borrowers took another step yesterday with the launch of a five-year Eurobond issue from Sun Hung Kai Properties. Sung Hung Kai Properties is the holding company for the largest property investment and development operations in Hong Kong. It is the fifth-largest company on the Hong Kong stock exchange by market capitalisation. Lead manager Morgan Stanley said Sun Hung Kai was able to raise Dollars 300m, Dollars 50m more than it had originally planned, due to greater-than-expected demand. The bonds were priced to yield 82 basis points over the when issued US Treasury due 1998, which was one basis point below the yield spread at launch on the Dollars 500m five-year issue from Cheung Kong in early September. Cheung Kong's bonds, which opened up the Eurobond market to Hong Kong borrowers, were trading at a spread of 85 basis points yesterday.</p>

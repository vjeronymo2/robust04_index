			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Ferromet plunges to Pounds 13m loss FERROMET Group, the USM-quoted metals trader, plummeted from profits of Pounds 624,000 to pre-tax losses of Pounds 12.9m in the year to December 31. Its shares were unchanged at  3/4 p. It said its accounts would be qualified by the auditors because, as previously reported, Ferromet Resources, had been placed into Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings by some of its bankers. It is the group's principal operating subsidiary in the US and 'a large part of the group in terms of assets and earnings', according to Mr Roger Wain, group chairman. Mr Wain said a full provision had been made in the accounts against the group's investment in the US subsidiary, though he declined to specify its size. He reiterated the comments he made in March that the board was in discussions with prospective new investors. Turnover in 1991 expanded to Pounds 73.6m (Pounds 48.3m), boosted by the acquisition of Cronite Alloys from the receiver in June 1991 and of Missouri Precision Castings (now under Chapter 11) in July. Operating losses amounted to Pounds 8.48m (profits Pounds 2.47m) after administrative expenses of Pounds 7.12m (Pounds 2.69m). Net interest payable grew by almost Pounds 1m to Pounds 2.72m and there were exceptional charges of Pounds 1.69m (Pounds 44,000). Retained losses came to Pounds 12.8m (profits Pounds 256,000). Losses per share were 6.25p (earnings 0.17p) and there is no dividend for the second year running. The board has shrunk to three members - Mr Wain, Mr Hillel, finance director, and Mr Larry Whyte, who in 1990 was paid more than a third of group profits for that period. Three directors have resigned since early December.</p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Senators attack US stance on aid for CIS TWO leading Senators, one Democrat and one Republican, have lent their considerable weight to the contention that the US Administration is not doing enough to assist the republics of the former Soviet Union. Reporting on a recent visit to Russia and Ukraine, Senators Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat, and Richard Lugar, the Republican from Indiana, said: 'We came away convinced our government is not yet adequately organised and energised' to meet what they described as 'an urgent need for assistance from the US and other democratic countries.' At a more partisan level, Senator Claiborne Pell, Democratic chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, took President Bush to task for 'a stunning lack of vision' in formulating policies towards the former Soviet Union. 'So far,' Mr Pell said, 'our much publicised humanitarian airlift has provided enough to feed Moscow for a day.' This subject has been the topic of the week in Washington, competing for attention with the latest primary results. Former President Richard Nixon had earlier weighed in with criticism of the 'pathetically inadequate' US response, warning that if Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian leader, were toppled a nasty despotism could result in Moscow. On Capitol Hill, Mr Robert Strauss, the US ambassador to Russia, berated American politicans from both parties for completely ignoring in the campaign what was happening in the former Soviet Union. 'I find it amazing,' he told a Senate hearing on Wednesday afternoon in typically blunt fashion, 'to come back in the middle of a presidential campaign and find that a subject as important was what we ought to be doing  .hasn't been the subject of any appreciable discussion at all. Mr Strauss said the issue of assistance should not become a partisan political issue in the US and that 'there is nothing more important we can do' than provide full US backing and funding for the IMF's new focus on the republics.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Arts: 'Weldon Rising' bares the breast - Theatre Replete with bare-breasted lesbian sex, three versions of the same fatal stabbing, a gay male couple, a transvestite male prostitute and a homocidal homophobe, here is the best new play I have seen in many months. Its excellence is not to do with its more sensational features, though they are necessary to it. This play is exciting because it is well written, unusually constructed, and (Leavis voice) morally serious. It is also (Macaulay voice) frequently funny. What makes it serious is that it is all about fear and responsibility. Jimmy, who has lived with Natty Weldon for 15 years, is stabbed to death by a nameless boy in the meat-packing district of New York during a heatwave. (The temperature is 120 and rising.) Natty is so scared that he runs away before Jimmy has even died. Three other people, however, observe the whole murder. They are Marcel, the transvestite, and the two dikes Jaye and Tilly. This draws them and Natty gradually into a web of quasi-complicity, because life changes for them all after the murder. They all have different accounts of the murder and drastically different descriptions of the murderer. And their accounts change; and Natty, growing feverish through grief, guilt (over cowardice) and heat, keeps re-telling, and re-living, his past with Jimmy with different emphasis. The different versions of the same facts give this play a Rashomon-like quality. Ultimately, however, the play The Royal Court, Theatre Upstairs, until December 19 aims to link its characters in a kind of moral coherence. It ends - too suddenly - in several kinds of apotheosis. The conclusion is the play's most peculiar and least satisfying feature, but every bit of it is riveting. The playwright, Phillis Nagy, is American and gay. I like the fact that she treats gay sexuality and gay society simply as objective facts, without preaching any pro- or anti-gay sermons. To say that one wants to see more work by her is true, but also condescending. Weldon Rising is achievement enough. (At 75 minutes - no interval - it is, if anything, too short.) I would like to speak more of the play's moral acuity - but what makes the Weldon Rising audience most grateful is its precise characterisation, first-rate dialogue, superb construction and fine acting. The most noteworthy character, the transvestite Marcel, always talks of himself in the third person. (Jaye: 'Why do you refer to yourself in the third person? Marcel: 'Marcel is the third person.') This is entertaining; it also works ironically in a play about spectators. The play interleaves past and present powerfully; and Natty, speaking now with hindsight, even interviews Jimmy, speaking as he did 15 years back - like the wise-after-the-fact conversations we all have in our heads. Every praise to the director, Penny Ciniewicz, for this co-production with the Liverpool Playhouse Studio. And to the cast of six: Simon Gregor (Natty), Andrew Woodall (Marcel), Melee Hutton (Tilly), Rosie Rowell (Jaye), Paul Viragh (Jimmy) and Matthew Wait (the killer) all catch perfectly the mixture of naturalism and irony in the writing. The action is taut, with not an ounce of waste flesh. Seats in the middle of the rows are recommended. Make an effort to ensure you arrive early enough to claim them.</p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Banco Latino may be refloated The Venezuelan government says it will attempt to refloat Banco Latino, the country's second largest bank, which failed last month. Mr Julio Sosa, the minister of finance, said on Wednesday that Latino would be restored to financial health and reduced in size. The recovery plan calls for providing new public and private sector capital for the bank, appointing an administrative board, 'improving communications' between the bank and its account holders and clients, and identifying those responsible for allowing the bank to collapse. It it not yet clear where fresh private capital will come from. The government's plan is intended to give a sense of direction to its handling of Banco Latino, which has been slow and uncertain. It also was meant to quash speculation that the bank would be liquidated, and to indicate that the government planned eventually to sell put the bank. Latino has been effectively shut since January 14.</p>

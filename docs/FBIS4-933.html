			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the ANC on the SAPA PR Wire Service on 20 </F> April]    [Text] ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging]  region premier-elect Tokyo Sexwale and two officials, Paul  Mashatile -- secretary general and Obed Bapela -- deputy  secretary general, came under heavy gunfire today, Tuesday, 19  April, after addressing residents at the National Peacekeeping  Force (NPKF) base in Thokoza.    Sexwale had earlier led a delegation of ANC PWV regional  leaders and local leadership of Thokoza on a fact-finding  mission and to address residents of the trouble-torn township.  After addressing residents at about 16h00, the entourage moved  to the NPKF base to verify residents allegations that the  force's image was no longer credible.    The entourage, led by Mr Sexwale held a meeting with the  second in command of the force and discussed the problems raised  by the community. Soon thereafter, Mr Sexwale addressed  residents inside the base and seconds after this address, heavy  gun-fire was heard from the direction of the hostel next to the  base. Officials, including Mr Sexwale, were forced to take  cover and swiftly went to their cars to get out of the area.    The ANC PWV region condemns this senseless attacks on its  leadership, whose sole purpose in the area was to difuse the  volatile situation in the area. Our visit in the area was also  to call for joint co-operation of forces now in the area -- SADF  [South African Defense Force] and NPKF -- and to listen to the  grievances of both the community and the NPKF personnel.    The ANC will pursue, with all means at its disposal, to find  resolution to the carnage that has engulfed the area and to  ensure that free and fair elections takes place.    The ANC PWV region will release a statement tomorrow, 20  April 1994, on its plans and intervention to stop the carnage in  the East Rand.</p>

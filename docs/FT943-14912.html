			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries fall in wake of weaker dollar US Treasury prices fell across the maturity range yesterday in the wake of higher commodities prices and another plunge in the value of the dollar. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/4 at 83, yielding 7.716 per cent. In the absence of fresh economic statistics, all eyes were on the dollar when the market opened, and it was a dollar that continued to weaken against other major currencies. It was not long before bonds began to slip in the dollar's wake, as the currency slumped to a new post-1945 low against the yen of Y97.70 and to DM1.53 against the D-Mark, its lowest level since late 1992. The decline in the dollar undermined prices because investors believed the Federal Reserve might be forced to raise interest rates, although most analysts said any move was unlikely until today's and tomorrow's June inflation figures had been released. A rise in commodities prices further undermined bonds, although the increase in the Commodity Research Bureau's closely-followed index was attributed by analysts to a surge in coffee prices following news of a bad frost in Brazil. As the dollar continued to tumble, portfolio shifts into Europe's safe havens out of US Treasuries bolstered European bond markets. 'After the G7 failed to offer a package in support of the dollar, there now seems to be less danger in allocating funds to Europe,' said Mr Chris Anthony, head of fixed interest research at Hoare Govett. While some traders reported large shifts in cash bonds by institutional investors, others said cash activity remained thin, with most of the action taking place in the futures pits. This spurred talk that hedge funds, which are often active in the futures markets, were behind some of the buying. Over the last two trading sessions, European bonds have shrugged off sharp declines in US bonds. 'The markets' resilience on Friday and yesterday has reawakened the issue of decoupling between US and European yields,' noted Mr Stephen Dulake, bond strategist at PaineWebber in London. However, he added that 'we haven't seen this uptrend confirmed by investor sponsorship, and I feel there are still many reasons to be cautious.' Mr Dulake said it was unlikely that European bond yields could fall on a sustainable basis unless US bonds recover or at least stabilise. Several key US statistics are due this week, and 'there's a strong risk that further declines in the US could undermine European bonds', he warned. French bonds rose sharply yesterday, outperforming their German counterparts after underperforming them last week. The September notional French government bond future on Matif rose by 1.12 points to 115.68. Sentiment was boosted by positive data, showing June inflation unchanged at 1.8 per cent year-on-year, and by foreign buying, traders said. Moreover, last week's successful bond auction has lent the market a healthier tone, a dealer said. UK gilts also had a strong day, boosted by buoyant continental European markets and overseas investor buying. The September long gilt futures contract on Liffe rose by points to 101 3/4 . The market was further cheered by a Gallup report of leading UK investment funds for Smith New Court, which showed that many fund managers are becoming increasingly bullish about gilts and view the market's recent weakness as a buying opportunity. German government bonds also benefited from the flight to safety by investors. The September bund futures contract on Liffe rose by 0.83 points to 93.32.</p>

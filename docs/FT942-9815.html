			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: DCC joins market in IPounds 6m placing DCC, the Dublin-based private industrial holding company, is to be listed on the London and Dublin stock exchanges from next Thursday following a placing of 3.3m shares at 250p per share. The company is raising IPounds 6m (Pounds 5.86m), but according to Mr Jim Flavin, chief executive: 'The primary objective of the flotation is to obtain a listing. Raising capital is a very secondary matter.' With 72.6m shares in issue after the placement DCC has a market capitalisation of IPounds 182m. Earlier this week DCC announced pre-tax profits up 49 per cent to IPounds 22.4m for the year to March 31. The group is focused on five divisions. Including associated subsidiaries, its energy division, comprising LPG and gas distribution and waste oil recycling, contributed 39 per cent of profits last year, its food division 27 per cent. Two others, print and publishing and computer products distribution, contributed a further 27 per cent. Mr Flavin said the group's strategy was to manage risk through 'spread and financial prudence. We are long-term in our thinking and believe that strong businesses are built over the long haul'. Mr Flavin founded DCC as a venture capital company in 1976 with capital of IPounds 180,000. The focus shifted to an industrial holding company in 1990. On last year's earnings per share of 19.56p the flotation gives an historic p/e of 12.8. This compares with an historic p/e for industrials in the Irish market of 17.8, and an overall market p/e of 15.1.</p>

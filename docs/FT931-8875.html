			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: French chemicals group takes control of Lorex SYNTHELABO, the French pharmaceuticals company that belongs to the L'Oreal cosmetics group, is expanding its interests in the UK by taking full control of Lorex Pharmaceuticals. Lorex, which was formed in 1983 to market Synthelabo's products in the UK, specialises in the development of cardiovascular and central nervous system drugs. Until now it has operated as a joint venture between Synthelabo, with 51 per cent holding, and Searle, the US drugs company which owns 49 per cent of the shares. Synthelabo is buying Searle's interest for an undisclosed sum and will run Lorex with Delalande, the French laboratory that it bought in late 1991. The Delalande acquisition followed six weeks after the purchase of Delagrange, another French laboratory. The two deals formed part of the expansion strategy pursued by Synthelabo under L'Oreal ownership. L'Oreal has been expanding Synthelabo in order to reduce its reliance on its traditional cosmetics interests and to add to its expertise in research, which plays an increasingly important part in product development within the cosmetics market. Synthelabo was one of the contributors to L'Oreal's strong performance last year.</p>

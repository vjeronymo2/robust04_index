			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DETROIT DERAILS MAJKOWSKI, PACKERS;  </P> <P> LIONS: THEY BUILD A 24-3 HALFTIME LEAD, THEN HOLD ON FOR A 31-22 VICTORY.  </P> <P> Green Bay's Dan Majkowski ran out of miracles just as Detroit's stubborn  defense was running out of gas Sunday.  </P> <P> Rodney Peete threw two touchdown passes to Richard Johnson and the defense set  up all of Detroit's points as the Lions beat the Packers, 31-22, for only their  second win of the season.  </P> <P> The Packers have come back to win four games in the fourth quarter this season,  including a last-second, 14-13 win over the Chicago Bears last week.  </P> <P> "Don't anybody write that there was a letdown," Packer Coach Lindy Infante  said. "There was no letdown today. We just got beat by a better team."  </P> <P> The Packers, with Majkowski passing for over 300 yards for the fourth straight  game, finished with a 31-8 edge in first downs, a 432-128 advantage in total  yards and controlled the ball 39:25 to Detroit's 20:35.  </P> <P> But the Lions stand-and-deliver defense -- which put Green Bay in a 24-3 hole  by halftime -- came up with two interceptions, five sacks for 36 yards in  losses and recovered two of three Green Bay fumbles.  </P> <P> "A lot of credit has to go to the defense," Peete said. "They got us great  field position. It's easy to get those 20- and 30-yard drives and score."  </P> <P> Majkowski, who has four of his seven career 300-plus games against Detroit,  completed 34 of 59 passes for 357 yards but had two costly interceptions, one  of which was returned 23 yards for a touchdown by Jerry Holmes.  </P> <P> "For some reason, the ball was slippery," Majkowski said. "I was throwing a lot  of high balls. They were getting away from me."  </P> <P> His 59 attempts broke the club record of 54 by Randy Wright against San  Francisco in 1986.  </P> <P> "We needed a better effort in the first half," Majkowski said. "We seem to be  in these situations every week. We're putting ourselves in these situations."  </P> <P> Peete completed only seven of 15 for 77 yards with one interception, but had  touchdown passes of 17 and eight yards to Johnson.  </P> <P> "I didn't play a particularly good ballgame today, but I'll take that and get a  win any time," Peete said. "I had a tough time getting into a rhythm."  </P> <P> The Packers (5-5) dropped to third place, behind Minnesota and Chicago, in the  NFC Central. Detroit is 2-8.  </P> <P> "We didn't play well in the first half," Infante said. "We dug ourselves too  big a hole. We put points on the board in the second half but we couldn't  generate enough."  </P></p>

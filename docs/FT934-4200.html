			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Travel: All this and Reagan, too - Snapshot The moment you see the policemen on bikes wearing natty blue shorts, you know you will like Santa Barbara. They patrol the town centre in pairs, mounted on black Raleighs. Whatever their abilities to catch criminals, they signify that Santa Barbara is a place to relax. Santa Barbara sits on the central Californian coast about 100 miles north-west of Los Angeles. On one side are the steep and rugged Santa Ynez mountains; on the other, the Pacific. Even though an eight-lane freeway races through the city, there is a feeling of calm. Perhaps that is why former president Ronald Reagan chose to live there. It is smart, quite affluent and big enough to be interesting, yet not so big as to be a sprawl. An exploration of Santa Barbara might start with the mission built by Spanish priests in the 1820s on a low hill just outside the central area. The sandstone church and outbuildings are quietly impressive and there is a shady, beautifully tended garden where you can while away a couple of hours. From there you could stroll down State Street, Santa Barbara's main road. You are surrounded for much of the time by widely spaced, white-washed buildings with orange-tiled roofs, most of them built in the 1920s after much of the town was flattened by an earthquake. Just off State Street is the Spanish-revival Santa Barbara county courthouse, a huge white structure which gives the judicial process a less-daunting aura than usual. The cavernous courtroom has a giant mural depicting Justice overcoming Evil, and there is a 70ft tower from which you get a marvellous view. Further down State Street, after a huddle of bookstores, clothing shops and restaurants, the road widens out to the seafront where the true charm of Santa Barbara is revealed. You can walk - the more fashionable take out their roller-blades - for two miles along a narrow esplanade next to the sandy beach, with palm trees along the shore. Most Californians are too aware of the dangers to stretch out for long in the sun, so the beach is likely to be deserted except for a few volleyball players. Nor is the esplanade likely to be crowded, even on a hot summer day. You might, however, need to move over once in a while to avoid the four-person pedal carts which you can hire for Dollars 12 an hour from Ocean Sportswear on State Street. Be sure to save some energy for Stearns Wharf, a 120-year-old wooden pier that juts out 440 yards into the ocean where State Street reaches the beach. Unlike the tacky and expensive pier at Monterey, just up the coast, or the awful Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco, it has style. The few ice-cream parlours and gift shops are pleasantly scattered and do not so much grab your money as ask politely if you want to part with it. By now, you might want somewhere good but inexpensive to eat. If so, try The Bakery on East Anapamu Street, a delightful Italian cafe started about two years ago by Susan LoBello Sullivan. It is reasonably central and serves home-made breadsticks, strawberry waffles and pasta as good as you are likely to find in Rome. After several days lazing around in Santa Barbara, climb into your hire car and drive 25 miles into the mountains to view Lake Cachuma, a giant reservoir which provides the city's water supply. Then, if you have the fortitude, travel a few miles further up the road to Los Olivos, a one-street hick town on the tour-bus itinerary which is peopled by loud women and men with cowboy hats. But be warned: in the summer, it will be stiflingly hot. Wandering around provides a sensation similar to scraping your fingernail on a piece of glass. It is easy to think of the answer, though: climb into the car and, in an hour, you can be back on a bench on Stearns Wharf. Your central nervous system will thank you for it.</p>

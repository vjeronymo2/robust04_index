The two presidents also announced that promotion of  Tehran-Ashgabat relations will gain further momentum from now on.    The Turkmen president told reporters at Tehran's Mehrabad  International Airport that three historical documents had been  inked between the two countries during his visit.    "The Turkmen delegation did a great job in conjunction with  their Iranian counterparts in economic, trade and cultural  fields...the agreements reached between the two countries will  entail great results for both nations in the future," he said.

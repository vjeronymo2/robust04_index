			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vice Admiral Fang Qiang (2455 1730): "Need for </F> High Technology Orientation in Building the Navy"]    [Excerpts] Editor's Note: Thanks to the  energetic support of Navy comrades concerned, this magazine has  invited several old Navy admirals to write some articles for it.  Even though these old admirals are advanced in years, when they  speak of the work they have done in building the Navy and their  future hopes for the Navy, they are filled with deep feelings.  They provide a very good window whereby readers can gain a  further understanding of progress in developing the Navy.  [passage omitted]  <H5>  Need To Face Squarely the Ever-Changing International </H5> Situation    Since the late 1980s, the international situation has  changed  very rapidly. One might say that this has been the most complex,  most unpredictable, and most tumultuous period since the end of  World War II during which a series of unanticipated major events  have taken place. This has included changes in Eastern Europe,  the unification of the two Germanys, the Gulf War, the civil war  in Yugoslavia, the dismemberment of the USSR, and the  dissolution of the Warsaw Pact. International tensions have  eased, dialogue has replaced confrontation, and peace and  development have become the two main themes of the world today.  Comrade Deng Xiaoping, who made a scientific judgment of the  international situation and the trend of developments based on  long observation and analysis, stated clearly that the increase  in forces for peace is greater than the increase in forces for  war. Although the danger of war exists, with good work, a world  war may be postponed. The winning of a long period of a peaceful  environment is possible. The way in which the situation has  developed completely confirms this scientific judgment of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping.    The current international situation appears favorable for  China's development. Nevertheless, some disputes between China  and some surrounding nations about territorial sovereignty and  maritime rights and interests remain basically unresolved.  Differences and disputes will go on for a long time, and may  possibly intensify somewhat under certain circumstances. As the  international situation constantly changes, the possibility that  limited naval warfare will occur cannot be ruled out, first  because of hegemonistic aggression, expansion, and provocations;  second, in order to recover island reefs that the enemy  occupies; and third, to contest marine economic rights. With the  development of high technology, a series of high and new  technologies such as nuclear energy, electronic computers,  spaceflight, microelectronics, automation, and new materials  have irresistably surged into the navy military realm, and have  been translated into weapons and equipment. Therefore, in order  to meet the constantly changing international situation, the  focus of the Chinese navy must be on modern technology,  particularly on preparing for limited wars at sea in which high  technology will be used.  <H5>  Need for a High Technology Orientation in Building the Navy </H5>   Jiang Zemin, chairman of the Central Military Affairs  Committee, Deputy Chairman Liu Huaqing, and Deputy Chairman  Zhang Zhen pay extremely close attention to the winning of a  limited high technology war, and they put great emphasis on the  study of how existing equipment may be used to defeat a better  equipped enemy. We must inculcate confidence about daring to  fight and being sure to win; and we must thoroughly understand  and study the history of our military forces in using inferior  equipment to triumph over enemies having superior equipment, and  our Navy's history of daring to fight and holding fast  tenaciously. We must be sure to maintain and develop these  special strengths.    The position of naval forces in a high technology situation  becomes more and more important. The achievements made in combat  operations at sea in which naval forces play the main role and  other service arms take part frequently exceed those of ordinary  sea warfare. Should a military engagement suddenly occur at sea,  we will unavoidably face the challenge of high technology  limited ocean warfare. Practice has demonstrated that whoever  possesses high technology will effectively control the combat  area, will seize the combat initiative, and will carry out  rapidly orchestrated attacks. In order to contain effectively  outbreaks of limited warfare at sea, it is necessary to focus in  peacetime on different goals and adopt different tactics in  different environments to demonstrate the existence and the role  of naval forces. This includes things such as conducting  exercises and weapons tests at sea. Visits abroad of naval  forces, regular naval forces exercises, forces deployments,  build-ups in combat areas, and participation in scientific  expeditions and marine surveys give pause to present and future  enemies. They make enemies understand that they will have to pay  an enormous price for any infringement of the sovereignty of our  territorial sea and marine resources. Thus, such demonstrations  play a deterrent role in containing limited wars at sea. Because  each battle in a limited war at sea has a direct bearing on a  nation's political and diplomatic battles, the outcome of  military activities will have an extremely great effect  internationally and domestically.    The Navy's "coastal defense" strategic policy requires  understanding of trends of development in navy building,  emphasis on advanced research, overall planning, long-range  planning, greater development of large and medium size vessels  suited to the development of China's navy, and making fullest  use of the role of submarines and water mines, as well as  torpedoes. Submarines are the main force employed in ocean  sabotage and guerrilla warfare, and they are also one of the  main forces in the conduct of mobile warfare at sea. Sea mines  and torpedoes are conventional weapons, but they still are very  potent under high technology warfare conditions. During several  recent partial wars at sea, they played an astounding role. In  high technology warfare, full use must be made of the role of  technical personnel. We must use the training of our own  personnel and the importation of others in combination. We must  tap the knowledge of available talent and fully validate it to  build our own large vessels to increase deterrent force. The  Navy is a technology-intensive, human talent-intensive service  army. Building the navy is a piece of complex systems  engineering. Genuine building of a a complete naval combat  capability requires attention to the building of systems to  improve overall integration, and increase overall benefits from  the building of the Navy.</p>

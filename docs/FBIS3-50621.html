			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Referring to reiterated comments by President  Juan Carlos Wasmosy on the obstructive attitude of the  legislative branch, Second Senate Vice President Basilio  Nikiphoroff said: "The president of the Republic, through these  new attacks, seems to be taking preliminary steps to close  Congress."    During a recent visit to Alto Parana Department, President  Wasmosy had stated that Congress seeks to hinder the democratic  process and to affect the dignity and honor of the Armed Forces.    The National Encounter senator added: "Frankly I do not  understand this criticism because Congress has expeditiously  debated 90 percent of the draft bills in a coordinated manner  and approved all the requests for credits submitted to us; I  honestly do not understand this attitude."    Nikiphoroff also criticized the executive branch's  successive  vetoes considering that in six months it vetoed seven draft  bills that had been approved by Congress. Nikiphoroff said:  "The president vetoes everything; however, we are not doing the  same." [passage omitted]</p>

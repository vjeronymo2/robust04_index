			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Fisons warns that recovery will be slow FISONS, the pharmaceuticals, scientific instruments and horticultural products company, will not return for years to the near 25 per cent growth it enjoyed in the 1980s, Mr Cedric Scroggs, the new chief executive, warned yesterday. The statement accompanied the company's first-half figures which showed a 58 per cent fall in profits to Pounds 40.4m. Fisons shares dropped 24p to 150p, as analysts cut their profits forecasts for the full year by about Pounds 20m to around Pounds 100m. Mr Scroggs hoped to announce over the next few months the disposals of the horticulture and consumer health divisions and CP Pharmaceuticals, which makes generic (unbranded) drugs. The sales, starting with CP possibly next month, should eliminate the company's Pounds 239m borrowings. He said the company was 'in advanced discussions' with other drugmakers over joint development, manufacture and marketing of new and existing products. Talks were being held with US and European companies. The profits decline was partly the result of a 13 per cent fall in drug sales to Pounds 206m which cut almost Pounds 16m from profits. 'The sales decline is unusual and unpalatable,' said Mr Scroggs, adding that the first two months of the second half showed an improvement on 1991. At the operating level, profits from the pharmaceuticals division fell to Pounds 23.1m from Pounds 68.1m in the first half of 1991. Profits were again damaged by the absence from the US market of the eye treatment Opticrom which was withdrawn two years ago after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the US drug licensing body, criticised production methods. Mr Scroggs acknowledged that the company had a difficult relationship with the FDA. He visited the head of the FDA earlier this year as part of moves to 'rebuild confidence' in the company. The costs associated with improving production standards to meet FDA rules, and lower profit margins, cost Pounds 18.5m in lost profits. Turnover from its biggest selling drug, the asthma treatment Intal, fell 10 per cent to Pounds 72m. In spring 1992, the company had supply problems with Intal as a result of more stringent quality control measures introduced to meet FDA requirements, but these have now been overcome. Sales of the newer asthma treatment, Tilade, rose 9 per cent to Pounds 12m. The company is still waiting for FDA approval for Tilade. Lex, Page 20; Market, Page 40</p>

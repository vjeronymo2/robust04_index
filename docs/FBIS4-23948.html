			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] French President Francois Mitterand, in an  address to a conference held at UNESCO on development, said that  the sending of humanitarian troops by France to Rwanda is just a  matter of hours and days. [passage omitted]    In a statement to the press this morning, Foreign Minister  Essy Amara said that our country supported France's initiative.    [Begin Amara recording] What is certain is that, at least,  this initiative has the merit of existing. I think Cote  d'Ivoire, after all the explanations, fully supports this  exercise, especially as it does not contravene the resolutions  adopted in Tunis. The Tunis resolutions underscored the urgent  need to bring an immediate end to the systematic massacres and  killings and also called for an immediate end to these heinous  crimes, which constitute a crime against humanity. I also think  that another conclusion from Tunis is the urgency in finding a  solution to these massacres, and it is from this perspective  that we must consider the French initiative, which consists  above all in stopping the killings and protecting the people  assembled in the various camps. As you know, the UN resolution  -- the UN Observer Mission for Uganda and Rwanda II -- calls for  the sending of 5,200 troops, but from what we have learned, so  far, there are only 2,900, which shows the difficulty in  establishing this force. This is why I believe that in view of  the urgency of the situation, it is necessary to initiate an ad  hoc operation. [end recording]</p>

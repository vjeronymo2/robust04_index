			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Ankara, June 16 (A.A.) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet  Cetin said on Thursday [16 June] that the regulations on the  straits were under the authorization of Turkey and it will be  put into effect on July 1 adding that giving up Turkey's  sovereign rights was out of question.    Main opposition Motherland Party (ANAP) Deputy Bulent  Akarcali, speaking in the parliament, claimed that decisions  against Turkey's sovereign rights were made during a meeting of  International Maritime Organization where Turkish delegation  also attended in London last month.    Akarcali said all Turkish sovereign rights on the Bosporus  and Dardanelles were transferred to international organizations.    He said Turkish delegation had no proposals while Greek  proposals were approved of with the support of Russian, Greek  and Greek- Cypriot representatives.    Answering the ANAP deputy's claims, Cetin said the stories  taking place in the press were not based on facts.    Cetin said the straits regulations were not discussed during  the so-called meeting adding that traffic schemes were brought  to that meeting. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Maverick building society may be on the side of the angel: C&amp;G's unconventional approach CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester has long been regarded as a maverick among building societies. Yesterday's decision to withdraw from the selling of insurance-related products goes against the industry trend and sets it apart from the other top 10 societies. Bancassurance - the sale of insurance-related products through bank-type outlets - is widely believed by the financial services industry to be a necessary distribution method for these products. It is seen as a cheaper and more efficient way of selling products to a receptive customer base than through direct sales forces, independent financial advisers or other routes. C&amp;G, the sixth-biggest building society by assets, is the first to defy conventional wisdom and to decide that bancassurance may not be all that others believe it to be. 'I don't think it can be fruitful long-term for every player,' said Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive of C&amp;G. Only some banks and building societies would be successful, he added. For one thing, he said, no bank's customers were likely to be exclusively its own. 'Each customer may be the customer of several other financial service companies as well. It is not fair to say 'We have 1m customers who are sitting ducks for new business' because others will be selling to them as well.' Moreover, he said, banks may find that when they begin insurance sales operations to customers who have never been approached before, they may get a good response. But successive approaches will find fewer and fewer who do not already have products they need or who are interested in having them at all. Finally, Mr Longhurst said, there is already too much competition in the industry. Industry analysts point out that C&amp;G's reputation has been tarnished through its association with Aylesbury Associates, a group of independent financial advisers which sold home-income plans mainly to elderly homeowners. Aylesbury has been suspended from operating by the self-regulatory body Fimbra. C&amp;G's role in home-income plans was simply to extend the mortgages, but along with other building societies it is compensating borrowers for some of the losses incurred on investments in which mortgage proceeds were placed. C&amp;G said much of the commission income it earned on sales of insurance products was eaten up by the costs of selling the products. It calculates that between a half and two-thirds of the time a sales agent spends with a customer is devoted to the process of selling the insurance product. Perhaps more important, C&amp;G has become disenchanted with the staple product sold through bancassurance outlets - the endowment mortgage. Mr Longhurst said: 'Endowment mortgages are not automatically in the customer's best interests.' Since May 1990 C&amp;G has been reducing the number of endowments it sells with new mortgages. Only 8.3 per cent of new borrowers is sold one - compared with an industry average of 69 per cent. The revenues C&amp;G derives from the sale of insurance products are believed to be less than 1 per cent of profits. 'The outlook for endowments is not so good,' said Mr Patrick Frazer, of consultants DIBC and author of Morgan Grenfell's annual report on building societies. 'C&amp;G looks as if it will be on the side of the angels while the other building societies find themselves in the position of having to defend what is increasingly seen as a rip-off product.' C&amp;G's move allows it to portray itself as sensitive to consumer needs, but it is also more easily able to divorce itself from bancassurance than the other societies. Its low cost-to-income ratio means it does not have to bolster its income through bancassurance, while its commission income from the sale of insurance-related products is lower than any of the other top 10, according to the analyst UBS. This low cost ratio has been partially achieved by low overheads. C&amp;G has a relatively small number of branches - 213, compared with 433 for Leeds Permanent, the fifth-largest society, and 259 at Bradford &amp; Bingley, the seventh largest.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BUILDING SOCIETIES TIES TO INSURERS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Top 10 societies ranked by assets  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  1     Halifax                             Standard Life  2     Nationwide                          Guardian Royal Exchange  3     Woolwich                            Woolwich Life  4     Alliance and Leicester              Scottish Amicable  5     Leeds Permanent                     Norwich Union  6     Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester             Legal &amp; General  7     Bradford &amp; Bingley                  Independent  8     National and Provincial             N&amp;P Life Assurance  9     Britannia                           Britannia Life 10     Bristol &amp; West                      Eagle Star  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Building Societies' Association/UBS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague Feb 21 (CTK) -- The Executive Council of the  Civic Democratic Party (ODS) shares the Foreign Ministry's  opinion that Defence Minister Antonin Baudys has not only  overstepped his bounds in submitting his personal Bosnia  initiative to foreign partners, but also harmed his country's  good name.    That is why the council has recommended to Premier and ODS  Chairman Vaclav Klaus that he consider strict measures against  Baudys up to and including his dismissal, ODS Deputy Chairman  Jiri Vlach told journalists during a pause in the council's  session today.    Baudys acquainted journalists with his proposal to end the  Bosnia conflict on Saturday [19 February], admitting that he had  consulted neither the government nor parliament.    Under the proposal, the conflict would be solved mainly by a  good will committee, which would be entrusted by the UN to  supervise the situation. The committee would comprise seven  states connected by religion with the Bosnian warring parties --  Russia, Greece, Pakistan, Turkey, France, Italy and one other  unspecified country.    Vlach said that Baudys (Christian Democratic  Union-Czechoslovak People's Party, KDU-CSL) had acted at  variance with the Constitution and harmed the Czech Republic's  credit as a partner seeking membership of NATO and being greatly  interested in joining the Partnership for Peace plan.    Vlach said it was not possible at the moment to say how many  emergency sessions had been called to deal with Baudys's  surprise move, but it was almost certain that the case would be  addressed by the government on Wednesday [23 February].    On Czech Television tonight Klaus called unprecedented the  fact that Baudys's proposal was conveyed first to foreign  partners and that the heads of foreign states received Baudys's  letter earlier than Czech "leaders."    "We must deal with two things -- to what extent the offence  was committed knowingly, and to what extent it was a badly  thought-out move," Klaus said.    ODS Spokeswoman Jana Petrova said that when Baudys presented  his proposal as his own personal initiative, it would have been  appropriate "if he had signed the letter containing the  initiative simply 'Antonin Baudys' and sent it by ordinary mail  to the representatives of other countries."    But sending it via military attaches, as he did, is not a  regular way for personal mail, Petrova added.</p>

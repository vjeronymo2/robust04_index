			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Improved AB Electron behind TT's 58% rise Profits at TT Group jumped by 58 per cent from Pounds 9.42m to Pounds 14.9m in the six months to July 2, reflecting the continued turnround at AB Electronics, acquired for Pounds 38.6m, including debt, in January 1993. Earnings per share rose by 31 per cent to 10.2p (7.8p) and the dividend is up 23 per cent at 3.2p (2.6p). The main improvement came from the electronics and industrial division, which includes AB and Magnetic Materials, acquired in August 1992. Profits jumped from Pounds 7.17m to Pounds 10.8m. On increased sales of Pounds 169m (Pounds 149m) margins improved from 4.8 per cent to 6.3 per cent. Mr John Newman, joint chief executive, said he expected further improvements in margins, though AB has some long-term contracts at low margins and a large board assembly business. AB's automotive business was back in profit and had won climate control contracts with Saab and Opel. Mr Newman said there were significant opportunities for AB in export markets. A new sales office was opened in Singapore at the beginning of the year to boost sales in east Asia. The resistor business, which joined the group with Crystalate, the electronic components company acquired in 1990, is doing very well in North America, but France remains weak. The division was expanded last month via the Pounds 16m acquisition of Dale Electric. TT said the improvement in its companies reflected the benefits of capital expenditure against a background of 'some hesitancy in the improvement of world economies.' Profits from packaging and building services edged ahead to Pounds 4.22m (Pounds 4.2m) and Pounds 406,000 (Pounds 381,000) respectively. Group operating profit rose to Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 11.8m), while the interest bill dropped to Pounds 461,000 (Pounds 2.33m) following last year's Pounds 51.4m rights issue. TT still has net cash of nearly Pounds 4m after the Dale deal and Mr Newman said there were a large number of acquisition opportunities with prices 'much better' than earlier in the year. 'But we will get Dale bedded down before we do our next major acquisition.' The shares rose 5p to 377p. A one for two capitalisation issue is proposed.</p>

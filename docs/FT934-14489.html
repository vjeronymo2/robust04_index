			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Man in the News: Mandarin in a masterly game - Jiang Enzhu Like a man engaged in a marathon game of 'Go', the Chinese version of chess, Mr Jiang Enzhu, China's chief negotiator in the Sino-British talks over Hong Kong, has given little away in a protracted struggle; but it appears now that he may be ready to break out of the pattern of stolid defence that has characterised the contest so far. When Mr Jiang said this week that the negotiations were at a 'crossroads', it was a clear sign that from China's perspective the two sides were now entering the beginning of the 'endgame' in their battle of wills over Governor Chris Patten's proposals for an extension of democracy in Hong Kong. In this typically Chinese game of encirclement, the 55-year-old Mr Jiang is proving an adept 'front man' in dogged defence of what he has described repeatedly as China's 'principled stand'. While his British counterpart, Sir Robin McLaren, UK ambassador in Beijing, has signalled the odd tactical shift - a hint of further British concessions galvanised the Hong Kong stock exchange yesterday - the Chinese official has played a waiting game, bolstering his defences and re-stating China's position ad nauseam. It is almost certainly a measure of Mr Jiang's diplomatic skills that at the end of more than 100 hours of face-to-face talks British officials know little more about their chief interlocutor than at the beginning, beyond noting a certain abrasiveness on occasions behind a bland exterior. To the outside world, and to those who have faced him across an oval table of an opulent guesthouse of the Diaoyutai compound in Beijing over 13 rounds of desultory talks since April, Mr Jiang has conveyed the impression of the very model of a modern Chinese bureaucrat. From his public statements to the press to his lengthy private monologues about Mr Patten's 'perfidious' plans to extend the franchise for elections due in 1994 and 1995, Mr Jiang appears not to have departed one iota from a carefully prepared script, or game plan. If Chinese 'chess' relies on infinite patience, and more than a little repetition, then he might be described as an exemplar in the diplomatic game. 'He tailors his performance to the occasion. He is one of their smarter operators,' is the assessment of a western official familiar with Mr Jiang's negotiating skills and urbanity. It is a reputation widely acknowledged in Beijing's gossipy diplomatic community where the Chinese official is a well-known figure, thanks to a series of high-level foreign ministry posts, including director of the Department of West European Affairs, before his appointment as vice minister in 1991. A native of Jiangsu province, south of the Yangtze, Mr Jiang entered the foreign ministry as a translator in 1965, the year before the Cultural Revolution brought chaos to China. His fluent English led him to a diplomatic appointment in London where he served as third and then second secretary in the late 1970s. While he has no reputation as an Anglophile, unlike several of his foreign ministry contemporaries, his language skills and his experience of dealing with the 'English' made him an obvious choice to head Beijing's negotiating team over an issue as sensitive as Hong Kong. Among his peers, he has a reputation for meticulousness and perhaps more important, patience. 'He is very professional and hardworking,' was the description one of his colleagues accorded him. But asked about anecdotes or personal details that might illuminate a picture of Mr Jiang foreign ministry cadres seemed at a loss. In keeping with reticence common to Chinese officials, Mr Jiang has shunned discussion about his background since the Hong Kong talks brought him to notice internationally. What seems certain is that his prominent role will do his career no harm. While Mr Jiang may not seem an obvious heir apparent to Mr Qian Qichen, China's long-serving foreign minister, there is also no doubt that his background, experience, and now sustained international exposure equip him for bigger and better things. A question that has hung over Mr Jiang since the first round of the Hong Kong talks has been exactly how much flexibility he might enjoy in the negotiations. Indeed, the foreign ministry's own influence in formulating policy on the vexed issue is unclear, and may be slight compared with that of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs office directly under the State Council or 'cabinet'. If Mr Jiang is unable, as some suggest, to depart by so much as a 'comma' from instructions formulated deep in the bowels of the Chinese bureaucracy, then within these limitations, he appears to have handled his 'brief' without faltering. Dressed in his conservative dark suits and sober ties, his hair tinged with grey, a coolly smiling Mr Jiang has contrived to appear in the eyes of the press to be a fairly avuncular figure. While talks stumble on he has not chosen to show his caustic side publicly, although if negotiations fail he can be expected to join in the noisy rhetoric that will surely follow. If it is possible to discern subtle mood shifts over the many months of the Hong Kong talks, then this latest phase indicates an appearance of increasing certainty on the part of the Chinese that in this elaborate chess game their tactics of encirclement and wearing one's opponent down may be giving them the upper hand. Judging, by phlegmatic reactions in Hong Kong to the ups and downs of Sino-British relations negotiations in Beijing over Mr Patten's proposals are hardly the worry they may have once been. Whether this insouciance would survive a rupture between London and Beijing over the Patten proposals is another matter, but Mr Jiang certainly contrived to appear unfussed about such an outcome when he told reporters this week that the talks were at a 'crossroads' and were 'faced with two possibilities: reaching an agreement or not'. 'If an agreement could not be reached,' he said, 'it would be no big deal.' In the Chinese game of 'Go' stalemate is a far from unusual occurrence.</p>

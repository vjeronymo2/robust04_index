			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Regulators may merge PRIVATE individuals could have a regulatory body devoted to their investment business from April next year. The new body would bring together jobs done by various regulators at the moment, in particular Lautro (which oversees the marketing of life assurance and unit trusts) and Fimbra (which is responsible for a motley array of financial advisers, investment managers and insurance brokers). The reason for the change: many independent advisers have been driven to become sales agents of life assurance companies. Sir Kenneth Clucas, who had been asked by the Securities and Investment Board, the chief investment regulator, to study the problem, warned this week that the body could get locked into a 'vicious spiral'. As members leave, the costs of regulation rise for those that remain, forcing more members to leave. Fimbra members are mostly paid by commissions, and cannot pass the costs of regulation to their customers, said Sir Kenneth. He concluded: 'The demise of Fimbra would be bound to threaten the continued availability of a wide choice of financial advice.' His recommendation is one watchdog to oversee both sales agents and independents, thus sharing the costs of regulation. To this new super-regulator could be added some of the investment managers currently overseen by another body (Imro), together with insurance brokers who answer to the Insurance Brokers Registration Council. The SIB broadly welcomed these ideas and has set about creating a formation committee to bring the new body into existence, so it has a fair chance of happening (though without the support of a large proportion of life companies, it may never get off the ground). The result may not be a renaissance in independent advice. The SIB is pondering proposals on how commissions paid by life companies are disclosed, and the complete separation of independent advisers and sales agents. These, say independents, still leave them at a disadvantage.</p>

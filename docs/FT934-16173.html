			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Bright outlook for commercial property loans securitisation AN unwillingness among banks to lend directly to commercial property developers following the property crash of the late 1980s has opened up a potentially huge market in securitising commercial property loans. Securitisation is a funding process which allows banks to take loans off their balance sheet, thereby removing the risk of default and freeing up capital. This is achieved by the banks placing these assets in a special-purpose vehicle which then raises money by selling debt securities to investors. The interest payments on the these so-called 'mortgage-backed' or 'asset-backed' securities are funded by repayments on the loans. The securitisation of residential mortgages and consumer loans is already widespread in the US and is starting to take off in the UK. Last week National Westminster Bank launched its first issue of mortgage-backed notes which raised Pounds 300m. However, the securitisation of commercial property loans is still at an early stage, says Mr Bob Wilson, global product manager at Nomura Securities International, the US arm of the Japanese securities house. In the US, the volume in securities backed by commercial property loans is currently around Dollars 12bn. Most of these securities were issued by the Resolution Trust Corp, the US federal agency charged with clearing up the debts caused by the collapse of US savings and loan institutions in the late 1980s. The RTC is expected to bow out of the market in the next year since it has almost completed the job it set out to do. Mr Wilson anticipates that Dollars 300bn worth of commercial property loans will need to be refinanced over the next three years. 'There will be no new money coming from the S&amp;Ls and only a little from the banks so the secondary market will need to provide most the capital,' he said. Nomura aims to be one of the leading players in the securitisation of commercial property loans. It is committing Dollars 3bn of its own capital to enable it to act as a principal in such transactions. It plans to use its global network to distribute the securities. The main attraction of securities backed by commercial property loans is that they offer a much higher yield than corporate bonds with a similar rating. Pension funds, banks and insurance companies looking to match long-term liabilities are the main buyers of these assets.</p>

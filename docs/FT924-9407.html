			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Prices are just managing to hold steady in Australia, though there is no sign of any build-up in confidence. Growers are still withdrawing wool prior to auction at times, a sign of dissatisfaction with present prices. Trade in Europe generally, and particularly in the United Kingdom, is made difficult by distorted and volatile currency alignments, which undermine confidence. Dollar strength in the past two months effectively raises prices for many users. China appears to be the best-placed economy and of major importance as a wool buyer in Australia and New Zealand at present.</p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SAN FERNANDO'S MCCRARY TO PLAY FOR CS FULLERTON  </P> <P> Howard McCrary, a Times All-Valley defensive back for San Fernando High, has  verbally commited to play football for Cal State Fullerton. The earliest day  for high school seniors to sign national letters of intent is Wednesday.  </P> <P> McCrary visited Pacific 10 Conference schools Arizona State, Oregon, Oregon  State and Washington, but chose Fullerton largely because of academic problems.  McCrary has yet to score 700 or better on the Scholastic Aptitude Test and  therefore has not met National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Prop. 48 requirements.  </P> <P> The Pac-10 schools would accept McCrary on a conditional basis only, but  Fullerton officials said he will be offered a scholarship even if he enters  school ineligible under Prop. 48 restrictions.  </P></p>

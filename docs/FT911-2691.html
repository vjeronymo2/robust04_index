			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (9): Padlocked into the ERM, but given a long chain - Sterling has rarely seemed in danger of breaking its bands STERLING'S years of living dangerously are over. Once the most volatile of internationally-traded currencies, the government finally padlocked it to the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System in October last year. To allow for its propensity to respond to the tiniest of domestic and international changes, the government gave sterling a long chain. Apart from the peseta, it is the only currency in the system allowed to move 6 per cent up and down either side of a central rate. Sterling's central rate was set at DM2.95 against the German currency, and over the last eight months it has rarely seemed in serious danger of popping out of its bands. That in itself sums up sterling's initial success in the ERM. It has been a performance which the monetary authorities have professed themselves generally 'comfortable' with. It has, up to now, been a far cry from the economic consequences of joining sketched out by Sir Alan Walters, once Mrs Thatcher's personal economic adviser. In his book Sterling in Danger, he makes the point that pegging the exchange rate would force Britain 'slavishly to follow that of the major monetary power, whether the US or Germany'. But what has become known as the 'Walter's critique' has been largely discounted. This was essentially that sterling, backed as it then was by 15 per cent base rates, would zoom to the top of the currency grid as the peseta did. Then the authorities would have to restrain it from appreciating beyond agreed limits with base rate cuts, thereby unleashing another demand boom and inflation. Only last month has the pound's appreciation - it rose to second place in the ERM - prompted speculation of rate cuts to restrain its further rise, with reunification worries weakening the D-Mark. But central bank intervention seems more likely to result from an over-strong pound. Such a satisfactory position was difficult to foresee back in October last year. The monetary conditions at the time of 1990 entry were regarded as inappropriate - a fact which renders considerable the achievement of Mr John Major, then chancellor, to foist the move on a recalcitrant Mrs Thatcher. Just before Mrs Thatcher was persuaded to agree in October, the all-items index of retail prices was rising at an annual rate of 10.6 per cent. Interest rates had been at 15 per cent for a year. The inflation conditions in particular invited widespread accusations that the ERM move was political engineering of the economy at the worst possible time. The Bank said the Government's 'dilemma' was that while monetary growth, output and real demand were falling, putting huge pressure on companies' trading margins, wage settlements and inflation were still rising. But Mr Major's gamble paid off. The Bank later acknowledged that joining would reinforce the Government's anti-inflationary strategy, as companies could no longer expect a lower exchange rate to validate their failure to contain costs. As it has turned out, inflation was on the way down as Mr Major had maintained, and the UK heading for a recession as deep as the one in 1980-1981. With hindsight, the much-criticised base rate cut that accompanied the move was more than justified by the speed with which the UK went into recession. Equally satisfying was the fact that the only limit sterling has come very close to touching has been the lower one, in December last year - the opposite of what Sir Alan argued would happen. The markets have provided both a floor and a cap for sterling, keeping it trading comfortably within its ERM bands. So comfortably, in fact, that rumours started circulating just before the March Budget that the government was going to tighten to the 2 1/4 per cent narrow bands. Since entry, sterling has steadily appreciated - even edging close to the DM3 level - against a background of domestic recession. Unemployment is rising by about 70-80,000 a month, while the current account is averaging around Pounds 1bn a month as imports respond to weak domestic demand. In reflection of falling economic activity, interest rates have been cut four times, by just half a percentage point each time. They are now at 12 per cent and are expected to fall further by June. This has not undermined sterling, however: the D-Mark has been weakened by the perceived 'disastrous' consequences of German reunification; the dollar is bouncing back from record lows - pulling sterling with it - as consumer confidence has resurged at the ending of the Gulf war and hopes that the recession will be as short and shallow as the Fed as predicted. But although sterling is strong now, it faces hurdles ahead. The government would clearly like to reduce interest rates further, to stimulate the economy and win voters in the run-up to the general election. As Mr Norman Lamont said in his Budget Speech, 'interest rates remain the essential instrument of monetary policy, but now the overriding factor in setting them is the need to meet the UK's ERM obligations'. This means the Bank cannot cut interest rates unless the move is fully discounted in the markets. What does the medium term then hold? A general election, for a start. If the election is in June, the pound will hold an election risk - though a Tory win should leave it higher than a Labour win or hung parliament. Goldman Sachs, the US-owned investment house, says that the Tories retain the credibility of having taken sterling into the ERM and would not be likely to devalue; a hung parliament's uncertainty would depress the pound while a Labour government would introduce market worries about devaluation and spending, in spite of the trust inspired by the Scottish members of Labour's front bench. An October election would produce much the same result, while one left till June 1992 would be likely to be held against a background of 4 per cent inflation and 10 per cent interest rates. With either a Tory or Labour win, 'the sterling/DM exchange rate's most probable path is very stable for the next six months,' says Goldman Sachs.</p>

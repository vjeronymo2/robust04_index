			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Arts: Pinocchio - Theatre Rotonde, Brussels How precisely children's fiction reflects national stereotypes: Babar the gentilhomme of Gallic chivalry, Toad and Water Rat dilettantist English land-owning types, Pinocchio, as this ingenious adaptation of Collodi's story by the Teatro Ragazzi di Verona shows, every stick and splinter the spoilt Italian son. Nothing pinpoints such differences more delightfully than the Brussels 'Festival International Jeunes Publics' (to May 13), a festival of children's theatre which brings together drama, dance and mime for children from theatres across Europe, America and North Africa. In Pinocchio, Gianni Franceschini has managed to create that box office winner, a children's play with enough adult interest for every parent to want to escort his offspring. Add half an hour to official starting times while excess audience is squeezed into aisles and staircases, and expect a riot at the end when it heaves as one on to the stage to mob the unfortunate puppet. Franceschini reworks the tale of the boy marionette who comes to life in the hands of his master as lighthearted human comedy with a touch of Punch and Judy. Gianni Volpe's set, a workshop platform backed by a mesh of cupboards, alcoves and windows, opens like a magic box to reveal countless theatres-within-theatres where Geppetto and the shrieking Pinocchio play out their drama of manipulation, each fancying himself as director of the show. This is simple, resourceful and never-endingly inventive theatre of the sort for which this children's touring group is well known. A blackout, a pole and a candle and you have the wild wood. For the Theatre of Mr Fire-Eater, a shelf is bathed in fluorescent crimson to become a mini-stage with its own purple curtain and neon signs. Waves of turquoise lights and ripples from triangles and tambourines suggest the sea when a trapdoor beneath the stage flies up to release a crowd of dainty marionettes from inside the belly of the whale. At other times, Pinocchio and his audience strut to rock'n'roll and swing along with a fairground barrel organ. This Pinocchio has everything: fantasy, slapstick, a sturdy story, an emotional game in which the spirit rises and falls like the yo-yo of the marionette strings. Geppetto, largely absent from Collodi's adventures, is the star of the show. Franceschini plays him in a great patched overcoat which doubles as a disguise when he dons the occasional part of the Fox or Cat. A beret turns him into a schoolchild taunting the puppet, a bowler hat and he is the circus performer who lets Pinocchio break a leg before throwing him into the sea. On stage continuously, he is at once contortionist, conjuror and ventriloquist, but he is at his best as the soft-centered Father spattering pleas and philosophy ('La vie est la parole') by turns. Eyes deep-sunken, nose a little long and crooked like Pinocchio's, expression quizzical and imploring, body hunched, he is the archetypal old man, flesh visibly crinkling up and limbs turning wooden through the stresses of his picaresque doings even as his puppet turns from wood to flesh.</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> WOODY HERMAN HERD PERFORMS AT HERMOSA BEACH CIVIC CENTER  </P> <P> Ghost bands are too often exactly what the name implies: dim and shadowy  apparitions from a glorious past. But the current Woody Herman Herd is a  vigorous, full-blooded exception.  </P> <P> Monday night at the Civic Center in Hermosa Beach, the 15-piece unit displayed  the qualities that have made the Herman name a virtual synonym for energy and  swing for more than half a century. The program was an eclectic mixture of old  and new -- from the classic "Woodchopper's Ball" to a brassy variation on Aaron  Copland's "Fanfare for the Common Man."  </P> <P> Frank Tiberi, a tenor saxophonist and clarinetist who has led the band since  Herman passed away, took the spotlight here and there, most notably on "Body  and Soul" and "Naima." More often, he turned the solo stage over to his large  collection of gifted young stallions.  </P> <P> The tenor-dominated saxophone section -- a staple of the Herd's sound since the  late '40s -- was easily comparable to the best the band's ever had. Jimmy  Giuffre's "Four Brothers," one of the great saxophone ensemble classics,  sounded new and alive in the hands of Tiberi, tenors Tim McCall and Chip O'Neil  and baritonist Mike Brignola.  </P> <P> Ron Stout, taking most of the trumpet solos, contrasted a delicate variation on  "Body and Soul" with a rip-snorting, plunger-muted "Greasy Sack Blues."  </P> <P> Tiberi, like Herman before him, seems to recognize that the magic formula for  the Herd consists of mixing eager young players with high-voltage  orchestrations and standing aside to let the musical explosion take place. It  worked for Herman, and it's working for Tiberi. You've got to think that the  old Woodchopper would be proud of the current Herman Herd.  </P> <P> The Woody Herman Orchestra also appears Thursday in a free concert at the  Marketplace in Long Beach, and Saturday at the Loa Club in Santa Monica.

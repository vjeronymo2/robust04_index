			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENDPAPERS: 'SLEPT THROUGH ANY POETRY LATELY?'  </P> <P> "Slept through any poetry lately?" The question is a headline in the July issue  of "The Write Stuff," the newsletter of the Pomona Valley Writers' Assn.  </P> <P> Poetry haters? On the contrary, poetry devotees of an indefatigable ardor,  sleeping only as lovers sleep, with slaked passion. The PVWA is sponsoring a  40-hour weekend workshop in the mountains near Green Valley Lake, an "endurance  experience for poetry lovers," including "round-the-clock readings (for the  mind); food, fresh air &amp; exercise (for the body); and an intimate,  inspirational setting &amp; time to create (for the soul)." "Plan to  participate/present/produce!" members are exhorted, but a warning follows:  "Maximum occupancy -- 20 poets."  </P> <P> I dream of being the Green Valley Lake hotelier whose job it is to enforce  maximum occupancy against the 21st poet: "Sorry, ma'am, it's the fire code.  Just doing my job." Far be it from me, however, to gainsay round-the-clock  poetry reading for those tough enough to take it. If marathon therapy can break  down neuroses, maybe marathon poetry reading can break down writer's block.  </P> <P> Poetry therapy in the strict sense (if strict is the right word) is thriving in  Southern California. Perhaps for kindred reasons, so is actors' poetry, or  actors' poetry therapy. In my experience, actors are never happier than when  they see the psychic agony of a fellow actor bleeding through into the  performance. Cafe Largo, the actors' poetry night club, struck me on my one  visit to it as a cross between equity waiver and psychiatric grand rounds.  </P> <P> Still, what all these forms of nouvelle poesie have in common is important.  They are all group experiences and as such a part of a multifaceted shift to  performance in all of American arts and letters. And that shift is no joke:  Henry M. Sayre's "The Object of Performance: The American Avant-Garde Since  1970" (University of Chicago Press) claims that this shift defines the new  avant-garde. In the visual arts, Sayre sees a move away from exhibition toward  mixed-media performance. In poetry, the analogous move would be away from print  to -- well, stick around: We're finding out.  </P> <P> The two shifts have points of direct contact. Reviewer George Leonard writes  (Book Review, July 16) of a pioneering performance, Yvonne Rainer's 1962  "Ordinary Dance," which was "a collage of pure dance movements and observed  behavior." "Instead of music, Rainer spoke 'an autobiographical narrative' as  she danced. Her 'dance' was itself often a mimicking of everyday motions, even  facial expressions, that she'd observed in the subway." Leonard muses: "Should  we call that dance or mime? 'Dance-supported confessional prose poetry'? "  </P> <P> How about cartoon? I ask, thinking of Jules Feiffer, who has been drawing  something like dance-supported confessional prose poetry for 25 years --  laughing at it but, clearly, enormously and lastingly struck by it. Both the  comedy and the pathos of Feiffer's dancer -- in her black leotard, with her  swooping hair -- is that she is a woman. Imagine a man in all those cartoons,  and the effect, simultaneously poignant and funny, evaporates. In this, Henry  Sayre would find only confirmation since he maintains that the new performance  art has been female in no small measure because women have been excluded from  mainstream art galleries.  </P> <P> Women are also notable by their relative absence from John Ashbery and David  Lehman's confidently titled "Best Poems of 1988," reviewer Ian Gregson notes  today on Page 3, in the first part of a six-part Summer Poetry Series, a series  we hope to make an annual feature of the Book Review. Also missing from that  volume, Gregson says, is another element that Sayre finds prominent in the new  performance art; namely, politics or what Gregson calls simply realism. The  poets that Ashbery selects wouldn't be likely to write about abortion, for  example. By the same token, the mainstream New York galleries that Sayre  surveys wouldn't be likely to exhibit paintings on abortion. So what do the  women do? They put on their ballet slippers and vote with their feet: "A Dance  to John Rehnquist." (Jules, are you taking notes?)  </P> <P> At the popular level, in America's television culture, the shift to performance  may have taken place a generation ago. But poetry and painting are among our  oldest, most durable and most conservative forms. We should expect them to be  among the last to be, as Marshall McLuhan put it, tribalized.  </P> <P> In the long run, however, they may well tribalize -- or re-tribalize -- more  easily than fiction, a younger but intrinsically more private form. Most  fiction is, to begin with, simply too long to perform. Do I hear you cry  "Nicholas Nickleby!"? A fair objection, but "Nicholas Nickleby" was a unique  effort, scarcely the start of a movement. Poetry readings -- thousands of them,  all year long, all over the country -- do constitute a movement. And the shift  to more elaborately mounted "literary" performance carries the movement a step  further.  </P> <P> Hitherto, the great strength of fiction was that it contained its own set,  lights, sound, special effects within itself. A play written with such  completeness would foil its own performance: It would render actors, director,  etc., superfluous. A lyric poem written at such length, given the demanding  intensity of lyric language, would be murderous. Once the shift to performance  begins, however, the relative incompleteness of lyric and drama become a more  crucial strength than ever and, by the same token, the completeness of fiction  becomes a weakness.  </P> <P> Of Michael Palmer, winner of this year's PEN USA Center West poetry prize,  critic Norman Finkelstein has written -- with admiration -- that he is "that  rarity, a major poet who is almost totally unreadable." Totally unreadable? The  compliment reads like an insult. But recall that many fine plays are  essentially unreadable. We don't care because unreadable, spoken of a play,  does not mean unperformable. If the play is any good, unreadable may mean  simply incomplete in the right way. Palmer is incomplete in a poet's, not a  playwright's, way, but his incompleteness nonetheless is compatible with  performance in a way that would scarcely be true of any fiction. You can  rewrite a novella or a short story for the stage. But, if you wanted, you could  choreograph a Palmer poem as written. And the step from poetry that may be  performed to poetry that must be performed -- poetry whose printed version is  only a kind of prompt -- may be smaller than it seems.  </P> <P> Novelists relish solitude and control. They write for readers like themselves,  readers who rejoice in the compact package that provides all they need for a  rich intellectual, emotional, deliciously private experience. If you are that  kind of person, the shift to performance may strip your gears. But the 20 poets  reading round the clock -- and apparently eating, jogging and generally  rusticating together as well -- may not be quite like you. Neither may be the  actors gathered of a night at Cafe Largo -- and otherwise not given to the  sessions of sweet silent page-turning. (No insult here. See Page 3: Ashbery  doesn't read either.)  </P> <P> The promise of a shift to performance in painting and poetry is the promise of  an infusion of energy and relevance. The threat in it is the threat that all  artists will be busted to set-designer and all writers to scriptwriter. The  situation is deeply ambiguous, so much so that if poetry is alive and well in  Los Angeles, the performance capital of the world, we do right to wonder  whether it is Los Angeles or poetry that has changed more.  </P> <P> Over the last two years, as the Book Review has continued to publish a poem  each week while cutting back on the number of poetry reviews, one distinguished  poet who has written in support is Donald Hall, winner of the 1988 National  Book Critics Circle poetry prize for "The One Day," a book-length poem that  successfully defied excerpting in our little poetry box and may well have  resisted public reading by its own author. No surprise here: Hall has publicly  decried the spread of what he calls "McPoetry"; that is, light, brief, often  wry poems written, consciously or unconsciously, with public reading in mind.  Though he has, to be sure, written short poems that read beautifully and even a  children's book, "The Ox-Cart Man," that reads beautifully again and again (the  kid test), Hall is more aware than most of what can be lost by the shift to  performance.  </P> <P> And yet the gains may be real too. T. S. Eliot had a way of reading his own  poetry that seemed to constrict his windpipe to about 12 picas' diameter. The  result was, to push the metaphor, that you could hear every kern and serif. And  too many poets, even now, seem to take Eliot as their public-speaking model.  When you begin with a poem that, as to its content, reads like a philosophy  lecture heard by a sleeping student (see Gregson, Page 3), the Eliot tradition  of public reading may induce terminal narcolepsy.  </P> <P> No one falls asleep at Cafe Largo, thank God for actors, and I venture to say  that the PVWA 20 won't drowse away their 40 hours either. If we're lucky, the  shift to performance will, by degrees, bring the vigor of song, chants ("We  Will Ree Lee Rock-You!"), cheers, slang, slogans and related oral stimuli back  into poetic play. If we're unlucky, however, the same shift may frustrate the  long strenuous coupling that perhaps alone can bring a serious reader into  intimacy and then identity with the mind of a great artist. That secret  struggle, I confess, is more my own way, and I prize most those who prize (and  preserve) it as a cultural habit. But we know, don't we, in what city and what  century we find ourselves.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FALL BRINGS A DIVERSITY OF ARTS: IT'S LIVE, IT'S NEW, IT'S LOCAL;  </P> <P> THEATER: THE CURTAIN OPENS ON A BROAD RANGE OF SELECTIONS FROM ORIGINAL WORKS  TO REVIVALS.  </P> <P> His father died; his girlfriend dumped him. And the up-and-down career of the  struggling actor was definitely down.  </P> <P> Not good things in Paul T. Murray's past. But, as he prepares his literary  catharsis for the stage, they may spell good things in his future.  </P> <P> "It's a condensed version of all the things I've gone through in 11 years in  Hollywood," Murray of Studio City said about his one-man play "Let's Get the  Hell Atta Here." Directed by Robert Mearns, the show opens Nov. 2 at the Third  Stage in Burbank. "It's a comedy, but it shows my anger toward the business,"  he said.  </P> <P> Murray, however, has enjoyed his share of success. He has appeared on TV's  "Beauty and the Beast" and in several low-budget films. He has high  expectations for his new play: "There's no question it will be a hit."  </P> <P> As the fall theater season opens in the San Fernando Valley, similar optimism  abounds. Revivals of popular shows and original material present a broad range  of stage selections. Among them are:  </P> <P> "Coney Island Arias," by Jake Coffone, is a comedy about a man whose Italian  machismo runs into conflict with his wife and daughter.

It tells  the story of a son who quits his father's business to move into his own  apartment. When his younger brother tries to join him, the parents have a fit.  </P> <P> "Veronica's Room," by Ira Levin, a psychological thriller about a young woman  from the Midwest who finds herself embroiled in a family mystery, runs from  Oct. 12 through Dec. 30 at the Richard Basehart Playhouse in Woodland Hills.  Cynthia Baer directs.  </P> <P> "Love and Kisses" is a comedy about a man's elopement with a childhood  sweetheart; meanwhile, his sister marries an older, stuffy banker. Directed by  Jackie Cowgill, it runs from Oct. 15 through Nov. 24 at the Glendale Center  Theatre.  </P> <P> "Bein' with Behan," the one-man presentation about the life of Irish playwright  Brendan Behan, starring Michael L. Kavanagh, will open an eight-week run Oct.  12 at the West End Playhouse in Van Nuys. The play, adapted by Kavanagh from  Behan's writings, focuses on his struggling writing days in Paris, his  membership in the Irish Republican Army and his eventual success in New York.  Directed by Bruce Heighley, it may move to off-Broadway next spring.  </P> <P> "A View From the Bridge," an Arthur Miller play about loyalty and jealousy in  New York City in 1954, opens Nov. 8 at the Gnu Theatre in North Hollywood.

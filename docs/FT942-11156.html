			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ankle deep in agricultural controversy - Alison Maitland attends a meeting of farmers, policy-makers and environmentalists Where better to debate the pros and cons of the European Union's changing agricultural policy than standing ankle-deep in a field that has been 'set aside' from its previous use of growing barley? The field, now sporting several varieties of wild plants, was the first stop on a farm walkabout this week in the picturesque Dedham Vale, in the Essex countryside best known through the paintings of John Constable. The tour, an annual event organised by the local Tendring Hundred Farmers' Club, provides an opportunity for leading policy-makers, lobbyists and farmers to discuss the most contentious issues in British agriculture. The debate, helped by a stiff breeze, was lively. Mr Patrick Holden, policy director of British Organic Farmers, said that set-aside, whereby farmers are paid to take a percentage of their arable land out of production, was a desperate measure by the European Commission to control grain surpluses. It would not work because farmers would simply intensify production on their remaining land. Hailing its environmental benefits - the lower use of pesticides or the reappearance of wildlife - 'is just making the best of a bad job', he said. 'It would be much better to de-intensify farming as a whole rather than to use set-aside as an oasis.' Not surprisingly, the officials from the ministry of agriculture disagreed. Mr Howard Fearn said that a study being carried out by Wye agricultural college had found no evidence of production being stepped up on the rest of the land. And he pointed out that while concern for the environment was not the driving force behind the common agricultural policy reforms, it was becoming inextricably linked with them as a way of making continued subsidies for farming more palatable. 'The only way of getting the taxpayer rather than the farmer to pay is to introduce something called the environment,' he said. This appears to be throwing up contradictions. Farmers choosing the option of non-rotational set-aside - where they leave a fixed area of their farm unproductive rather than rotating the site each year - are contributing more to wildlife. But the impact, in terms of reducing production, will be less great as only the poorest land is set aside, according to agricultural economists. A huge cloudburst forced the al fresco meeting to reconvene in a barn, where the steam was visibly rising as the arguments over environmentally-sensitive farming grew hotter. Conservationists wanted subsidies transferred wholesale from mainstream agriculture to promoting environmentally beneficial farming practices. But, apart from stressing the difficulty of Britain persuading its EU partners to go down that road, the man from the Treasury said he doubted whether the taxpayer would agree to Pounds 3bn a year being reallocated to an industry that had already been so heavily supported in the past. So what did the scores of farmers present think of the prospects? The view was suitably down to earth. 'At the end of the day, farmers have got to produce a net profit,' said Mr Jim Macaulay, one of the organisers. 'They can look towards the movement of sustainable farming, but if they take their eye off the costs they're in deep trouble.' The problem facing farmers in Europe is that many of their competitors elsewhere in the world do not face the same tough legislation on animal welfare or pesticide use - one reason why they can produce much more cheaply  -said a senior official from the National Farmers' Union. Mr Oliver Doubleday, who farms in both England and Brazil, said UK farmers were naive if they thought they could survive without subsidies. 'It's a huge trap to think we ought to be trading on world prices,' he said. 'You just don't realise how low they are. There are going to be people - and I hope it's going to be me - who will clean up behind you.' Mr Macaulay concluded that UK costs of production would have to come down 'if we're to stay in farming and deliver what the environmentalists want'. Exactly how high-cost, high-quality producers in Europe would continue to survive once markets became more open remained unclear. So did the common ground between the environmentalists and the bureaucrats. But at least the farmers were happy - they had got the rain they needed.</p>

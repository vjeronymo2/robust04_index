			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1920 GMT on 29 January carries the regularly  scheduled "Top Secret" program presented by Arten Borovik.    Today's program "The Nuclear Button" is devoted to nuclear  weapons in Russia and the United States. Borovik starts the  program by saying the nuclear threat still exists: the video  shows a button on which is written "To execute the launch"  [proizvesti pusk]. Borovik continues, noting that several weeks  ago he visited a Russian nuclear missile base located not far  from Moscow. The video show a rocket launcher aimed at the  (?Warren) missile base in Wyoming. Borovik notes that in 30  minutes Russian missiles could reach the Wyoming missile  facility.    At this point one General Gribov is identified as the  commander of this particular Russian missile division. Borovik  says that all officers and soldiers who work at the Russian base  are regularly examined by doctors because the fate of out planet  is in their hands. Borovik notes that none of the personnel  know what the targets are for the Russian missiles; however,  they know exactly whether a particular order is a training or an  operational order.    The video continues with Borovik noting that there are many  such nuclear missile bases throughout Russia, Ukraine, Belarus,  and Kazakhstan. He notes that all these facilities are united  in one single nuclear command center located approximately 25  minutes driving distance from Triumfalnaya Arka in western  Moscow, in a place identified as Vlasikha.    At this point in the show, Colonel General Igor Sergeyev is  identified by caption as the commander of this enormous nuclear  facility, itself a legacy of the former Soviet Union. Col. Gen.  Sergeyev is cited as the commander in chief of the strategic  missile troops. Borovik notes that Sergeyev was born in 1938  and has been in missile troops since the initial days of  inception.    At this point in the show, Borovik has a few comments about  the nuclear weapons program in the United States. In  particular, he notes the recent visit by a top Russian military  delegation, led by Col. Gen. Sergeyev. Borovik says this was  the first meeting of professionals in this field. He goes on to  describe in detail key aspects of the meeting: the video shows  Col. Gen. Sergeyev with other members of the Russian military  delegation in the Pentagon.    Next in the program, Borovik incorporates an interview with  scientist Aleksey Arbatov, identified as an expert for the "Top  Secret" program. Arbatov is heard making several remarks  regarding different aspects of nuclear weapons in Russia as well  as in the United States.    Borovik then is seen asking Col. Gen. Sergeyev about the  position of the Russian nuclear missile troops during the coup  in 1993. Col. Gen. Sergeyev says: "I can only say that this was  a very difficult time for everybody, including us. Our main  task, whatever was happening, was to continue our guard duty, to  be completely prepared, to professionally inspect operational  posts, and to carry out measures for increasing protection and  defense of operational launching positions in order to avoid the  situation in which nuclear weapons become a card which somebody  suddenly would like to play. This was out of the question: not  because we are so good but because our lifestyle, our  understanding of the dangerous and destructive weapons in our  hands, our sense of responsibility in this difficult situation  with respect to the fate of our people, for nuclear security,  for strategic stability--I think all of these issues ensured  that our missile specialist, as he is now and who, in these  difficult conditions, is continuing to fulfill his duties."    Throughout the program, Borovik touches upon a very  important  question: who will give an order to push the nuclear button in  case of war? Col. Gen. Sergeyev states: "The command will be  given in the established order. It must come only from the  president." At this point, scientist Arbatov states: "According  to our Constitution, in the case of the incapability of the  president, all his functions revert to the head of the  government or the prime minister. Thus, this button, or better  to say this difficult mechanism, will go to his legal successor."    Concluding the program Borovik expresses his gratitude to  the  leadership of both the Russian and U.S. Defense ministries for  their help in preparing the program.</p>

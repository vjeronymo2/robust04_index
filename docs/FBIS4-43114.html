			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin by Rahmi Aygun </F> in the studio in Istanbul -- live]    [Text] [Aygun] The North Atlantic Cooperation Council  [NACC] meeting has been held in Istanbul. The joint statement  which was supposed to be issued at 1800 [1500 GMT] has not been  issued yet, because of arguments among the member countries  concerning the agreement on the reduction of the conventional  forces in Europe [CFE] and on the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict.  The news conference to be held by NATO's acting secretary  general at 1800 has been postponed for the same reason. In  fact, Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin was to have held a news  conference at 1915. His news conference has been postponed for  the same reason. However, the foreign minister is now here with  us. Mr. Minister, welcome. What is the reason for the delay?    [Cetin] Of course the delay should be received with  understanding. Some 38 countries have come together.  Furthermore, countries that used to be enemies in the past.  The NATO and former Warsaw Pact countries used to be enemies  for a long time. Now, a new organization and a new working  system is being set up envisaging their cooperation.  Consequently, you need the 38 countries to agree on the joint  statement. There were long arguments about two issues, like you  said. One of them concerns the CFE; Russia wanted to include in  the statement that this issue will be discussed by the countries  involved. Long arguments and negotiations were held. In the  end, an agreement was reached not to include that in the  statement.    The second issue is also understandable. Azerbaijan and  Armenia, which are members of the NACC, are in conflict with  each other, in fact Armenia has occupied Azeri land. These two  countries are expected to reach an agreement. Naturally, it  took some time for them to agree. In the end, an agreement was  reached, and the problem of the statement was resolved. Of  course, the negotiations are still going on. The ministers are  continuing to express their views on general issues. I will go  back to the meeting soon.    [Aygun] There are certain misunderstandings between NATO and  Russia concerning the signing of the Partnership for Peace [PFP]  agreement. How do you view the relations between Russia and  NATO? It seems that the process of signing the PFP will take  some time.    [Cetin] Everything is being done to ensure that it will not  take long. Russia wants to establish with NATO different kinds  of relations than the relations of the Central and East European  countries. It wants to change the PFP agreement into special  relations. The Russian defense minister made certain proposals  in connection with this matter a while ago. The answer of the  NATO ministerial council, of the 16 member countries, was clear:  Special relations will not be established with any country.  Only the PFP framework agreement can be signed.    However, given Russia's position and the contributions it  can  make to Europe, and to peace and stability, certain special  cooperation fields can be developed with it after it signs the  PFP agreement. Mostly, in line with the contributions Russia  will make in the implementation of the agreement, more  cooperation possibilities can be developed. Another framework  agreement will not be signed.    A second demand by Russia that was not accepted -- the  Russians had several requests which were mostly accepted -- was  to turn the NACC into an independent organization from NATO, in  fact, into a superior organization to NATO. This will not be  accepted. NATO has to continue with its former power and former  identity. The ministers agreed on that absolutely. In other  words, NATO cannot be turned into an organization where certain  countries and Russia will have the right to veto. NATO cannot  be turned into a secondary organization in Europe. NATO is  determined to maintain its former identity. Within this  framework, all the countries want Russia to sign the PFP  framework agreement as soon as possible. As I said, Russia can  be expected to make higher contributions to peace and stability.  New cooperation possibilities can be developed in line with its  contributions. A proposal was made to sign an additional  protocol together with the PFP agreement. This was rejected as  well.    [Aygun] You are saying that NATO is not making any  concessions.    [Cetin] Yes, NATO is remaining loyal to its principles. It  does not want to differentiate first class countries and second  countries among the countries with which it is establishing  relations under the PFP agreement. They must all sign the same  framework agreement.    [Aygun] Thank you, Mr. Minister.</p>

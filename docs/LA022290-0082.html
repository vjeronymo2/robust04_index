			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MY BEST RECIPE: CHINESE CHOWDER  </P> <P> "For many years, I have had a simple fish chowder recipe that used chicken  stock, rice, bacon and green onions," Sharon Gable writes. "My husband loves  hot cuisines, spicy food and Chinese cooking, so I combined the three to make  this soup.  </P> <P> "It took some trial and error to come up with this version; and sometimes I use  rice or noodles, instead of cellophane noodles. It is hot and spicy, so I serve  ginger ice cream for dessert, otherwise it's a meal by itself."  </P> <P> CHANNEL ISLANDS SICHUAN FISH CHOWDER  </P> <P> 4 ounces cellophane noodles  </P> <P> 2 (48-ounce) cans clear chicken broth  </P> <P> 1 cup rice vinegar  </P> <P> 6 tablespoons Sichuan chili sauce  </P> <P> 6 tablespoons sugar  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons minced garlic  </P> <P> 1 pound bean sprouts, rinsed and drained  </P> <P> 1/2 pound Chinese pea pods, stringed  </P> <P> 2 large onions, sliced  </P> <P> 3 bunches green onions with tops, chopped  </P> <P> 1 (14-ounce) can straw mushrooms, drained  </P> <P> 1 (8-ounce) can sliced bamboo shoots, drained  </P> <P> 2 (8-ounce) cans sliced water chestnuts, drained  </P> <P> 1 pound bacon, diced  </P> <P> 4 pounds fish fillet (cod, snapper or halibut)  </P> <P> 1 (16-ounce) package frozen Oriental style vegetables  </P> <P> 1 large can crunchy chow mein noodles  </P> <P> Soak noodles in hot water 30 minutes, then drain.  </P> <P> Combine chicken broth, rice vinegar, Sichuan chili sauce, sugar and garlic in  large soup kettle. Simmer 10 minutes.  </P> <P> Combine bean sprouts, pea pods, onions, green onions, straw mushrooms, bamboo  shoots and water chestnuts. Set aside.  </P> <P> Fry bacon in large skillet until crisp. Drain on paper towels. Remove all but 4  tablespoons bacon drippings from skillet. Reheat pan and fry fish fillets just  until done. Drain on paper towels.  </P> <P> Add cellophane noodles, fresh and frozen Oriental vegetables to broth mixture.  Simmer until vegetables are tender-crisp. Serve hot topped with fried fish,  bacon and chow mein noodles. Makes 8 to 10 servings.  </P> <P>  -- SHARON GABLE  </P> <P> Oxnard  </P></p>

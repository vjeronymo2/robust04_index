			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yelena Yakovleva, IZVESTIYA: "`Gusinyye Lapki' </F> [Crow's Feet] Against Chicken Legs"]    [Text]  <H5>  Food Production Is Declining, While Consumption Is Growing </H5>   Food production in our country continues to drop, while its  consumption, to grow.    In the opinion of Alla Moshkina, a leading scientific  associate at the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of  the Consumer Market and Marketing, in 1992 Russians passed the  lowest point of decline in food consumption (2,400 calories per  day). In 1993 there was a small increase (2,600), and in 1994  (2,700) our ration will exceed the 1991 level. True, calories  represent a gross indicator, which is not very indicative of the  crux of the matter. As in bygone days the quantity of steel and  wool did not guarantee the appearance of reliable combines and  fashionable blouses, so the number of calories is not an  indication of good nutrition. Most Russians have a food ration  of a carbohydrate nature (they eat bread and potatoes more often  than meat and milk). However, little by little the consumption  of livestock products is also increasing. For example, in 1990  Russians consumed 6.3 kg of meat and meat products per month, in  1991, 5.8, in 1992, 4.8, in 1993, 5.2, and in 1994 (according to  forecasts), 5.5. Furthermore, the consumption of vegetables  should be restored this year and that of fruits and berries will  even exceed last year. True, our previous nutritional level is  not a standard. In 1990 a Russian consumed 49 grams of animal  protein per day and in 1993, 39.7, while the recommended norm is  55.7.    However, in Alla Moshkina's opinion, the general trend,  nevertheless, is favorable: Food consumption will grow slowly  despite the reduction in its production. The population's  gradual adaptation to new market conditions, rapid growth of  production on private subsidiary plots, direct trade, from  vehicles, by agricultural producers, expansion of trade by  private individuals (especially from near abroad), an economical  expenditure of food, and, of course, import are the main reasons.  <H5>  The Most Unpleasant Trend: Day-to-Day Goods Are Becoming </H5> Fewer    The washing away of relatively inexpensive day-to-day  goods--milk, vegetables, potatoes, sour cream, and frozen  fish--and their replacement either with expensive products, or  simply with any junk, are the most unpleasant trends noted on  the food market recently.    The paradox lies in the fact that the country is overflowing  with food raw materials (in many regions stocks for 1 month and  longer have accumulated) and there is a big demand for them, but  primarily the processing industry prevents those that want to  sell, for example, milk and those that want to buy it from  making contacts. This is the "bottleneck" on the consumer  market. Monopolism, technological backwardness, the habit to  dictate terms both to producers of agricultural products and to  consumers, and high, but "eaten through," profits--the food  industry would be happy to preserve such a situation for a long  time. Imported food is in the way. It simply forces it out from  the market.    This forces food industry workers to make a move. And it is  worth making a move. According to Alla Moshkina, technologies,  for example, for the quick freezing of 40 types of fruits and  vegetables were developed in the country as far back as 15 years  ago: Take and use them.    Trade, like the food industry, is not very concerned about  the impoverishment of the assortment of inexpensive goods and  their disappearance; in part, because to trade in potatoes every  day is a more labor-intensive occupation than to doze near a bar  of imported chocolate for 1 month. Moreover, it has been noted  more than once that trade "circulates" the money made from the  sale of potatoes or milk instead of returning it to processors  and agricultural producers.    If it is impossible to count on administrative measures, in  Alla Moshkina's opinion, only an increase in prices of basic  necessities can bring them back to the counter. It will be  necessary to pay "bread" and "milk" money, that is, subsidies to  consumers, but, nevertheless, to release the prices that, for  the most part, are maintained. True, a stereotype has already  been formed in our country: If oil prices are released, this is  a new step on the path to the market and, if bread prices, this  is a knife in the back of reforms.  <H5>  Triumphal March of Imported Food Throughout Russia and Its </H5> Consequences    Imported food is rapidly expanding the geography of sales  and  the trade assortment.    In March alone regular trade in imported pastry and fruit  cakes in private stores increased from 60 to 87 percent, in  chocolate, from 87 to 93 percent, and in chicken legs, from 13  to 53.    The market is simply saturated with some imported products,  for example, chocolate, but the rise in its prices has stopped.    However, unfavorable trends are also present here: There is  an expansion in the assortment of goods that are not most  essential and not of the highest quality. Researchers say that  Italian canned meat and Danish sausage have already acquired the  steady status of "those that are disliked."    Still, domestic producers have a serious chance for success.  Consumer patriotism safeguards them. According to observations,  in Germany's eastern lands an unequivocal preference for  imported food lasted 3 years, but in our country tastes,  possibly, will change even more rapidly--if a serious domestic  competitor is found.    A curious situation has emerged on the market of domestic  candy and chocolate. "Mishka kosolapyy" [Pigeon-toed Mishka] and  "Krasnaya shapochka" [Little Red Riding Hood] appeared in stores  (in the same wrappers, which our fellow-citizens pasted in  family albums in order to preserve them in historical memory),  raising a storm of nostalgic feelings in the souls of Russian  consumers. It seems that "Gusinyye lapki" [Crow's Feet] and  "Rakovaya sheyka" [Crawfish Tail], which sank into oblivion,  have been added to them, but in new attractive wrappers. Judging  by surveys, people of the older generation unequivocally prefer  former Soviet candy and caramel. If confectioners remember the  provinces, to which "Gusinyye lapki" have not yet returned, the  widest sales market will open to them.    Everyone--confectioners, dairy industry workers, and  margarine producers--can count on consumer patriotism if they  begin to produce high-quality, tasty, and beautifully packaged  products.  <H5>  It Would Be Good To Eat Not Only Well, but Also Correctly </H5>   It is interesting that in our country there are problems not  only in the "practice" of the diet, but also in "theory"--more  accurately, in ideology.    In the Western world the theory of a balanced diet, which  requires the purification and refining of products, has long  been defeated by the theory of an adequate diet, which insists  on the preservation of basic natural components. (In luxurious  Western restaurants dark unrefined sugar or bread with bran will  be served without fail to you). However, our consumers seem to  get stuck at the crossing from one theory to another; all the  more so, producers, from whom the new diet ideology will require  new technologies.    However, according to the data of surveys by the All-Union  Scientific Research Institute of the Consumer Market and  Marketing, our patriotic consumer, at the same time, is very  amenable to the appearance of new products on the market; for  example, soybean protein, or spring water.  <H5>  Who Is Short of What? </H5>   Judging by surveys, needy families experience a shortage of  the most essential goods, that is, milk, sour cream, pot cheese,  onions, and garlic, which are "washed away" from the assortment.    Average and highly paid population groups would like to have  constantly on sale fresh and frozen fruits and natural juices  (especially in winter), dry fruits, cheeses, buckwheat,  Krasnodar tea, mayonnaise, and live fish...    High-income families are short of fine grape wines, fruit  and  chocolate creams, black and green olives, fillet steaks, caviar,  and bitter chocolate.    The distribution of preferences seemingly does not contain  discoveries, but there are curious exceptions.    Research by the All-Union Scientific Research Institute has  shown that Russian students are perfectly well familiar with the  assortment of imported chocolate and often buy it by no means  out of considerations of prestige, but simply to satisfy their  hunger; as before, cabbage pies.</p>

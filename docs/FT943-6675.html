			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Granada recovers Turnover in leisure company Granada Group soared to 9.7m and the shares added 6 to 505p, after several brokers recommended the stock. The list included UBS, Smith New Court and Kleinwort Benson and Henderson Crosthwaite. Mr Paul Slattery at Kleinwort was sceptical about recent speculation suggesting Granada had its eyes on contract caterer Gardner Merchant. The talk is said to have held back the stock in recent sessions. He said: 'It is unlikely the company would give such an indication, as it would make such a deal more expensive.' He urged investors to buy the stock, saying 'the shares are now on a favourable multiple to the market'. Smith New Court also recommended Rank Organisation where the shares advanced 13 to 426p after good business of 6.4m shares. Daily Mail Group fell sharply in the A shares after the newspaper hit the London news stands priced at 20p instead of 32p. There was an assumption that the mid-market tabloid had been sucked into the newspaper price war. The group announced that the quoted price was the result of an 'operator error', but the shares closed 10 lower at 1020p. United Newspapers fell 5 to 548p as bearish NatWest Securities repeated its negative stance following the move by News International to tighten the screws in the current price war. News International, which owns the Times and Sun, raised advertising rates partly offsetting its recent price cut. Generator Scottish Hydro gained 20 to 427p following a recommendation from Panmure Gordon, which said the shares had lagged stablemate Scottish Power, up 11 at 438p. Food retailer Kwik Save gave up 6 to 643p after Hoare Govett advised investors to sell the stock. However, speculation that it might buy the Lo-Cost retail chain from Argyll Group continued to power the latter. The shares finished 11 1/2 better at 315p. Brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle moved against the market trend finishing 2 lower at 529p. Pollution control group Waste Management lifted 26 to 619p following a successful presentation by the company to analysts. Glaxo was restrained by US profit taking in early trading, but turned around in the afternoon to close 4 up at 658p. Debt-laden engineering company BM Group cheered the market with the Pounds 17m sale of Benford, its construction equipment subsidiary. The shares jumped 6 to 50p. Industrial group Charter continued to bask in the glow of its improved bid for Esab, the Swedish welding equipment group. The shares gained another 15 to 836p. High street clearing banks responded to encouraging lending figures. The British Bankers' Association said gross mortgage lending announced by rose to Pounds 1.81bn in July from Pounds 1.75bn in June. Lloyds rose 10 to 559p, NatWest 12 to 501p and Barclays 8 to 587p. Building and construction stocks responded to fading interest rate worries and indications of good results to come. Strongest was Barratt, due to report on September 21, which rose 9 to 191p. Mr Scott Fulton at Smith New Court said the group was likely to see strong growth over the next two to three years, levelling out afterwards unless prices moved up. Other analysts felt the good performance was simply a catch-up after recent weakness. Andrews Sykes was up 10 to 78p, with Bellwinch up 2 to 44 and Wimpey closing up 4 at 164p. Building materials companies had a good day, with Caradon the strongest performer, rising 11 to 315p on reasonable volume of 2.9m. Analysts were divided about Caradon's fundamental values - doubts still exist over the performance of its Pillar subsidiary and the margin squeeze at its US cheque printing operation - but the market is looking for a further rise of between 10 and 18 pence. Tarmac, up 3 to 156p was another high volume trader reaching 5.1m after heavy trading from the US. Blue Circle was up 2 1/2 at 309 1/2p and Redland, a strong performer yesterday, was up a further 8 at 545p.</p>

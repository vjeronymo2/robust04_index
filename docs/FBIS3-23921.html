			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marat Salimov: "All of Russia Encompassed by </F> Hard Currency Control"]    [Text] The system of hard currency and export control  has been extended to cover the entire territory of the Russian  Federation. In accordance with the Decree of the Russian  Government "On the Territorial Organs of Hard Currency and  Export Control," territorial organs of the Russian Federal  Service for Hard-Currency and Export Control are being  established in a number of oblast centers of Russia, including  Moscow and St. Petersburg.    The Russian Federal Service for Hard Currency and Export  Control was established in June of last year by special  governmental decree. In accordance with the Government's  decision, the service was granted broad authority, enabling it  to obtain information on the movement of hard currency in  exporter accounts. In the absence of a federal network of  subordinate structures, however, its attention was concentrated  mainly on the large-scale producers of export production that  have customs and hard currency privileges and on authorized  banks.    With adoption of the Decree "On the Territorial Organs of  Hard Currency and Export Control," the central organ of the  Russian Hard Currency Control Service obtained the opportunity  to "spread networks" throughout the territory of Russia. Now  organs involved in controlling exports and the procedure for use  of hard currency are being established in Moscow, St.  Petersburg, and in a number of oblast centers. The decree also  establishes the total number of employees in these territorial  organs at 350 persons (not including security and building  maintenance personnel). The wages of directors and employees of  the territorial organs are established at the level of the  appropriate category of employee in the central service. The  apparatus of the territorial organs will be financed out of  state budget funds.    Clearly, the formation of a network of territorial organs of  export and hard currency control will not make life easier for  Russian exporters. But the effectiveness of the new system is  not indisputable in any case--there was no shortage of control  personnel in the regions prior to the establishment of special  control organs, and the practice of unlawful use of hard  currency obtained from export operations was nonetheless  widespread.

			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALASKA SAYS SEAFOOD HARVESTS ARE SAFE  </P> <P> The disastrous oil spill from the tanker Exxon Valdez will not affect the  quality and wholesomeness of Alaskan seafood this season, according to a trade  group representing the state's fishermen and wholesalers.  </P> <P> The announcement, by the Alaskan Seafood Marketing Institute, is aimed at  maintaining consumer confidence in an industry whose 1988 catch totaled 5.5  billion pounds. The harvest's dockside value, or the amount paid fishermen, was  valued at $1.7 billion last year.  </P> <P> Several precautions are being taken this year to ensure the safety of the  catch, such as intensified monitoring for contamination in both the water and  fishery products, the Juneau-based group announced recently.  </P> <P> Concerns center on the Prince William Sound, the area in which the spill  occurred on March 24. Since the tanker ran aground, these waters have been  closed to fishermen. The action primarily affected the local herring and salmon  catch. Of lesser economic value were harvests of halibut, black cod and  shellfish.  </P> <P> However, the area affected by the spill is not a major factor in the state's  seafood industry. In fact, Prince William Sound represents only one of 15  approved fishing grounds in Alaska. Further, not even all of the sound has been  closed.  </P> <P> "The sound is a very large place and portions of it are just fine," said Merry  Tuten, the institute's executive director.  </P> <P> The industry's reassurances come just days before the fishing season begins in  earnest on May 15 when boats are allowed to catch halibut during a closely  controlled 24-hour period. The Copper River salmon season will also begin on  that same day.  </P> <P> Prior to any commercial fishing though, state-supervised tests of water and  fish quality will be conducted. The surveys will be monitored by the federal  government.  </P> <P> According to Tuten, the tests for halibut have already been completed.  Preliminary indications are that oil is not now a problem in the Gulf of Alaska  -- where much of the fish is caught -- nor even in some parts of the sound.  </P> <P> "What they determined is that the (traditional fishing) area is clear and free  of any oil," said Kevin O'Sullivan, the institute's quality assurance  coordinator. "The scientific tests for any potential oil in the liver or gall  blatter of the fish (were negative)."  </P> <P> The testing is being done by the Alaskan Department of Environmental  Conservation and the Department of Fish and Game. The agencies are using, among  other methods, organoleptic testing, which involves a visual inspection of the  fish.  </P> <P> "Oil is something visual and aromatic. You can easily spot the contamination  and the state won't allow it," said O'Sullivan. "If there is any oil at all in  the fish then it is contaminated. . . . And any catch containing it would be  condemned, confiscated and destroyed."  </P> <P> Alaskan seafood currently on the market was harvested well before the spill and  poses no problems to consumers, institute officials said. They added that there  is little to fear from Alaskan salmon, halibut, crab and shrimp that will be  arriving in stores in the weeks to come.  </P> <P> "We feel completely confident with the public's consumption of Alaskan  seafood," said O'Sullivan. "We place a great deal of confidence in the  (surveillance) program, and consumers would be foolish to pass up the unique  eating opportunity of Alaskan seafood."  </P> <P> Whether the group's endorsement is enough to restore consumers confidence in  the state's seafood is unknown. Even the institute acknowledges that it's too  soon to determine the spill's effect on prices and supplies this year.  </P> <P> "No, the (Exxon Valdez) did not help us," said O'Sullivan. "But Alaskans are  used to problems and are used to dealing with them. And we will deal with this  one."  </P></p>

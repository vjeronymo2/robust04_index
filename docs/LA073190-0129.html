			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STATE CUTS IN HEALTH FUNDS ARE CRITICIZED;  </P> <P> BUDGET: AGREEMENT REACHED BY THE LEGISLATURE ELIMINATES $14 MILLION FOR  EMERGENCY CARE FOR THE POOR IN ORANGE COUNTY.  </P> <P> Cuts in state funding for emergency medical care to the poor were described  Monday as just another "devastating blow" to an Orange County program that has  always been inadequately funded.  </P> <P> "We just lost $14 million in funding, and we're always short there anyway,"  said Ernie Schneider, county chief administrative officer. "There's not enough  money for adequate indigent care."  </P> <P> The seriousness of the cuts in the long-awaited $55-billion state budget the  Legislature passed Saturday was beginning to hit home Monday, especially those  cuts earmarked for the county's Indigent Medical Services program, which  reimburses local hospitals for the treatment of more than 22,000 patients a  year. County officials said most of the people the program covers are accident  victims.  </P> <P> Under the budget passed by lawmakers, the Indigent Medical Services program  would lose $14 million, a 55.3% reduction from its base budget of $24.6  million.  </P> <P> The action brought harsh criticism from all sectors of government and the  health care industry.  </P> <P> Calling it a "tremendous hit on Orange County," State Sen. Marian Bergeson  (R-Newport Beach), said it was a "devasting blow to the program -- a program  with no alternative revenue sources and no safety net."  </P> <P> Bergeson said the formula used to determine the amounts cut from the county  program was unfair and was not agreed to by the state Senate when it passed the  budget bill.  </P> <P> "The services are going to have to be provided. These are the people who fall  through the cracks and have no means for medical care. We are required to  provide the treatment, and somehow we are going to have to do it," she said.  </P> <P> Bergeson and state Sens. John Seymour (R-Anaheim), Dan McCorquodale (D-San  Jose) and Alfred E. Alquist (D-San Jose) are the co-authors of a letter to  Deukmejian asking him to veto the apportionment language in the bill.  </P> <P> Bergeson said the bill that went to the governor's desk made the cuts to the  program on a per capita basis. When the bill left the Senate, the program  reductions had been substantially less for Orange County under a different  formula.  </P> <P> Many top county officials said Monday that they are waiting to see how much  money the governor would cut from the budget. Deukmejian was expected to veto  hundreds of millions of dollars in programs before signing the $55-billion  budget.  </P> <P> But the strongest reaction was to the Indigent Medical Services program cuts.  </P> <P> "It's a cruel joke balancing the budget by withholding services to sick mothers  and children and the working poor," said Chauncey Alexander, chairman of the  United Way Health Care Task Force. "Balancing the budget on the backs of the  poor is a disgraceful activity."  </P> <P> Joan Furmin, president of the Orange County Coalition of Community Clinics,  said the reductions will just compound existing health care problems.  </P> <P> "Access will be more difficult. Medical problems will be more complex," Furmin  said. "In fact, were are going to see much more of a drain on the health system  because a lot of situations which could be handled with low-cost care now will  escalate."  </P> <P> County figures show that the overall 1989-1990 budget for Indigent Medical  Services was $33 million. But, officials said, $9 million of that came from  other programs that will no longer be available for indigent care.  </P> <P> Jean Forbath, founder and director of the Share Our Selves Clinic, which serves  the homeless and working poor in Costa Mesa, called the proposed cut "horrible  news."  </P> <P> "It will have a devastating effect," Forbath said.  </P> <P> At the Hospital Council of Southern California, which represents the 28 largest  hospitals in Orange County, vice president David Langness also expressed anger.  </P> <P> "My response is almost unprintable," he said. "These are the budget cuts that  everyone feared the most that will create, I think, just a massive amount of  disruptions, morbidity and mortality."  </P> <P> Langness said hospital representatives were lobbying Monday to head off further  cuts by the governor.  </P> <P> Education's TEACHING  </P> <P> The most important lesson of the state budget battle is that initiatives work.

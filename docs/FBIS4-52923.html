			<p>BFN     [Text] Aranyaprathet, Thailand, May 15 (AFP) -- Khmer Rouge  guerillas have attacked and disabled a bridge on the outskirts  of the key Cambodian town of Sisophon, a Cambodian government  officer said here.    About 50 Khmer Rouge guerrillas on Saturday blew up a  section  of a bridge which connects Sisophon to the town of Mongkol  Borey, eight kilometers (five miles) east, he said.    The bridge on National Route 5, part of the government's  supply route, had been made impassable for large vehicles,  according to officer with the Cambodian-Thai Coordination Office  (CTCO).    Government troops managed to drive off the guerrillas from  the structure and reinforcements had been sent, he said.    Mongkol Borey was believed to have been attacked by Khmer  Rouge forces at the same time, the officer said.    Detailed reports from the area were unavailable.</p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / France plans slight easing of squeeze FRANCE'S government plans a slight relaxation of its policy of fiscal rigour next year, but still intends to keep the budget deficit below 2 per cent of gross domestic product. In a circular to spending ministries, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, prime minister, has ordered that total volume of budgetary expenditure may rise only 3.5 per cent. This compares with a forecast rate of inflation of 2.8 per cent, and a 5.5 per cent expected nominal rise in gross domestic product. The increase in spending and the continued sluggishness in tax receipts, as a result of the recession, mean that next year's budget deficit is likely to rise to around FFr150bn (Pounds 15.13bn), against FFr135bn this year. This increased deficit would nevertheless be less than 2 per cent of GDP, which the government regards as a politically critical ceiling. By setting this new maximum, it intends to show that France is fully able to meet the conditions for participation in European monetary union, which include a budgetary deficit ceiling of no more than 3 per cent of GDP. Spending priorities in next year's budget will be job creation and employment, and education. The government also intends to reduce employment in government service.</p>

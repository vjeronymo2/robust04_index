			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / EOC warns of pensions 'debacle' THE GOVERNMENT is in danger of creating 'another poll tax debacle' over its handling of the equalisation of state pension ages for men and women, the Equal Opportunities Commission warned yesterday. Many people would not know until it was too late that they might be substantially worse off under pension measures being considered by the government, the commission said. Women in particular stood to lose if their age of entitlement to state pension was raised from 60 to 65 - the present retirement age for men. The commission accused the government of failing to consult widely enough and of blocking some options for reform with 'a selective wall of statistics'. A Department of Social Security paper on options was issued at the end of last year. Organisations are to make their comments by the end of this month. Moves to equalisation follow a European Court ruling in 1990 that different retirement ages for men and women are discriminatory. The DSS consultation paper favoured a common retirement age of 63, while the pensions industry and organisations such as the British Institute of Management want a flexible scheme, with retirement possible between 60 and 70. Ms June Bridgeman, commission deputy chairwoman, said the government was on the verge of a decision that would shape the pensions system for the 21st century. 'It will affect many things besides the immediate question of setting a common age for old-age pensions,' she said. It concerned everyone, yet most people were unaware that the consultation was taking place. 'It is crucial that the changes make people generally better - not worse - off and win popular support. If it does not do these things, the government is in danger of risking another poll tax debacle.' The commission yesterday described a common pension age of 60 as the 'best and simplest option'. It said millions of women already had a raw deal and the commission was concerned that equality might be achieved by making women even worse off. She added: 'The largest number of complaints received by the EOC from men is about pensions. For equality to be achieved to the detriment of women would be a bitter pill for both sexes.'

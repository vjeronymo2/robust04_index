			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / The best lines of defence: The political and commercial challenges facing Europe's arms industry If the cold logic of commerce were the only factor, then the French foreign legion would be using bullets from Lancashire, and French shells would be whizzing across the British army's training ground on Salisbury plain. Such a pooling of resources between munitions makers makes business sense. As tensions have eased after the cold war, almost every western country has been quick to claim the peace dividend, and governments have trimmed defence budgets as a proportion of gross national product. At least on paper, European countries are committed to the principle of pooling arms procurement efforts as companies grapple with declines in both domestic and foreign sales. Mr John Weston, chairman of British Aerospace defence, is confident that talks on collaboration between Royal Ordnance, the BAe subsidiary which makes bullets, and Giat of France will bear fruit. But before this happens, both companies will have to satisfy a small caveat from the UK Ministry of Defence. If the UK has to use French bullets, then France has to use British ones. As a ministry official put it: 'Any dependence must be mutual.' This lingering wariness between Europe's ancient nations means the continent's defence industry is not streamlining as fast as its counterpart in the US. As American groups rationalise and regroup, Europe's politicians and industrialists are still searching for ways to follow suit without sacrificing all their secrets and sovereignty. The commercial rationale for consolidation is equally powerful on both sides of the Atlantic. Throughout the western world export sales are in decline. At constant 1991 prices, Britain, France and the US saw total arms exports fall from Dollars 25.7bn in 1987 to Dollars 14.4bn in 1991. In the US, the response to this challenge has been rapid. The plunge in government arms purchases - to about Dollars 40bn next year from Dollars 120bn a decade earlier at constant 1993 prices - has already prompted an extensive restructuring in the industry. General Dynamics has sold its tactical aircraft business to Lockheed, its missiles operations to Hughes and its electronic systems to Carlyle. Most recently, Grumman was the target of a Dollars 2.2bn tug-of-love bid between Northrop and Martin Marietta, which Northrop won. Compared with this hectic activity, rationalisation in Europe has been sluggish. Europe still produces three types of main battle tank, against one in the US. It is also designing three advanced fighters - the Eurofighter, the French Rafale and the Swedish Grippen, while the US is concentrating on one - the Lockheed/Boeing F-22. The contrast has not gone unnoticed in Europe. Mr Louis Gallois, chairman of Aerospatiale, the state-owned French group, said in London recently: 'Not without government intention and support, the American aerospace industry is completely restructuring. Ignoring merger control and anti-trust legislation, very profitable mammoth companies are being formed in almost all product categories.' Behind these comments lies a gnawing fear that economies of scale will enable US companies to launch a price war long before Europe has had time to get its own corporate act together. There are a few signs that Europe is starting to react. Dasa, the German aerospace company, announced a plan to cut 16,000 jobs last year; British Aerospace has been in negotiations for the past 18 months to merge its missile business with Matra of France; Aerospatiale is in similar talks with Dasa; the UK defence and automotive group GKN has bought the helicopter-maker, Westland. Yet progress has been painfully slow, and there is little consensus on how European industry should rationalise. Some, including Lord Weinstock, managing director of GEC, believe defence is essentially the business of individual countries, and that larger groupings will be formed within states rather than between them. For instance, Lord Weinstock says that GEC and BAe may eventually work together as joint prime contractors on projects or conceivably pool some defence interests. Sir Colin Chandler, chief executive of the UK tank maker, Vickers, takes a different view. He sees cross-border co-operation in weapons production as the most likely way forward: keeping separate the companies making particular products, but allowing for joint ventures and joint weapons development. The vision of cross-border collaboration is shared by Sir David Lees, chairman of GKN, who says: 'There is no other way forward. The pressures on stretched budgets are driving towards more collaborative programmes.' The most spectacular multinational project to date is Eurofighter. This Pounds 32bn bid by Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain to be in the vanguard of military aircraft technology has divided German opinion. Also in the pipeline are a Dollars 7bn project to build a new military transporter, the Future Large Aircraft (see chart); a Franco-German armoured car; and a frigate involving Britain, France and Italy. As technology becomes more expensive, it may no longer be feasible for any European country to build a cutting-edge weapons platform alone. Co-operation therefore sounds appealing and politically prestigious. But grandiose plans for the future will not remove the need for painful decisions about current production. Building weapons in more than one country may make it easier to raise development capital, but it does not necessarily save money. Overheads and production facilities may be duplicated unless some countries are prepared to relinquish manufacturing. Matra, for instance, has decided that collaboration on specific projects is not a sufficiently radical solution to Europe's cost-cutting problem. It argues that it needs to pool equity as well as expertise with its European counterparts to compete with rivals in the US. But does Europe have to choose between national giants, cross-border project collaboration, or multinational mergers? Mr Weston of BAe thinks not. He foresees 'a mixture of national and international mergers to rationalise the industry'. Nor is he persuaded that Europe is falling behind the US. 'Europe does have some barriers to overcome which the Americans do not. But then the European industry probably started to sort itself out long before the US.' However, as Lord Weinstock points out, European companies cannot be expected to make strategic decisions until governments have defined their foreign policy priorities more clearly. 'The defence industry needs direction from governments, but the situation is far more complex now that the cold war is over,' he says. European governments are drawing up a defence shopping list in the light of a partial, and possibly total, US withdrawal from the continent. This should be concentrating minds in foreign ministries and boardrooms, but so far there has been only a stumbling convergence between leading members of the Western European Union, the embryonic security organisation. Britain, the standard-bearer of links with the US, now accepts that the WEU's importance will increase and that in certain conflicts, Europe may act alone. France, long suspicious of Washington's intentions toward Europe, now worries about too little US presence in Europe rather than too much. But key questions about the size and function of Nato remain wide open, and all discussion of Germany's role will be hypothetical until this summer's verdict by the constitutional court on whether the Bundeswehr can serve overseas. European governments broadly agree on what they need for home defence or to fight a small version of the Gulf war without US help: mobile armour, a strategic airlift capacity, satellite intelligence, and early warning systems to detect and intercept long-range missiles. Where they do not agree is on what all this implies for the arms industry. For France, it is axiomatic that European self-sufficiency in arms can only be attained through self-sufficiency in arms production. With its own budget under strain, it feels more strongly than ever the need for cross-border collaboration. Next week, France and Germany will reaffirm their commitment to establish a joint arms agency, initially to manage existing projects but with the possibility of becoming a powerful procurement executive. There is some scope for mutual advantage between France and Germany in export markets. France needs German capital and engineering skills, while Germany sometimes benefits from France's global connections, and its relative freedom from export restrictions. German companies are barred by law from exporting arms to areas of actual or potential tension. Last year's Dollars 3.5bn sale of French tanks with German engines to the United Arab Emirates looked like a neat way round that problem - although even that deal required a special permit by the Bonn government. The UK, for its part, does not accept that defending Europe necessarily implies buying European. For its forthcoming purchase of helicopters, the British army is thought to favour the US-designed Apache rather than the Franco-German Tiger. To meet its strategic airlift requirement, it is keeping open the options of buying more US Hercules aircraft or coming back to the European Future Large Aircraft, from which it withdrew in 1989. Even France is conscious of the high price of investing in European capabilities. Mr Francois Leotard, the French defence minister, has acknowledged that in pure budgetary terms, it might be better for France to buy Hercules aircraft. He has even suggested that both FLA and the four-nation NH-90 helicopter may have to be axed unless production costs can be trimmed by 20 per cent. However, he remains committed to both projects because of their importance for European industry. Other items on the European wish-list will be even more expensive. France has virtually completed one military satellite programme, the Helios, with help from Spain and Italy, but it cannot drum up much enthusiasm for further space extravaganzas. While seeking financial help from its European partners, France is traditionally reluctant to share sensitive technology. Recent defence ministry documents state clearly that the country no longer has the money to be self-sufficient in defence electronics or weapon-building material. But its insistence on independence in nuclear matters is undiminished. Nuclear technology is proving increasingly costly, but among European states which do not trust each other enough to make bullets, such strategic collaboration is even harder. Besides, while France is protective of its own nuclear secrets, Britain's relationship with the US prevents it from passing on American technology to other countries. The most ambitious European dream of all would be the construction of a strategic anti-missile defence system to rival America's now-defunct Star Wars plan. The military case may be growing, as rocket technology becomes available to increasing numbers of uncomfortably close and potentially unstable countries in the Middle East and North Africa. However, even the US has been forced to curtail its aspirations in the field of anti-missile defences. So it seems unlikely that Europe will be able to raise the enormous sums necessary to implement such flights of fancy. At a more practical level, even a streamlined European defence industry may not be able to afford to design a shield against low-technology Scud missiles of the kind used in Yemen over the past few days. Such large-scale projects would require clarity of military purpose, political will and industrial cohesion - all of which are lacking at the moment. Ironically, the end of the cold war, which has brought such savings for the US, may increase the burden on the European taxpayer. Politicians may be called upon to explain to voters that they face a peace levy and not a peace dividend, if the continent is to defend itself without US help. To make matters worse, the political challenge coincides with intensifying competition from American defence contractors which can merge and co-operate without hand-wringing over technology transfers and issues of sovereignty. As one European expert put it: 'The US is rationalising over three to five years. Europe is moving over 10 to 15 years. That is the kind of gap you just don't close.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Europe's defence under attack  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Leading cross border projects  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Eurofighter: fighter aircraft Participants: Britain, Germany, Italy, Spain.

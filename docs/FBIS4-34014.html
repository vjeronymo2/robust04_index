			<p>BFN     [Text] A meeting with Spanish King Juan Carlos was the  first official activity that President Frei carried out in  Cartagena, Colombia. Commenting on this meeting, Frei said that  he discussed the current situation in Chile and his  administrations' projects.    In addition, Frei reported that King Juan Carlos had  expressed interest in paying another visit to Chile, and that  some dates were already under discussion.    Asked about Chilean support for Cuba's return to the OAS,  Frei said that this all depends on Cuba, which must restore  democracy and uphold human rights. Cuba ceased being an OAS  member in 1962.

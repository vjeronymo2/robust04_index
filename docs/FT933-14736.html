			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Arts: A symphony of familiar effects - Concert At the Barbican on Sunday, Radu Lupu gave an immaculate account of Beethoven's C minor piano concerto, the Third. The light gravity which is Lupu's special grace - everything judiciously weighted, nothing portentous - was ideal for the work. Though his platform demeanour was dour as ever, he lit up every movement, from his beautifully poised entry in the first movement to the playfully pointed Rondo. The Largo was a singing idyll. The London Symphony was conducted by Mstislav Rostropovich, who is regularly at his best when accompanying an artist he admires. Throughout, he was as attentive and sympathetic as could be. So he was, evidently, in the Fourth Symphony - 'The Morning Star Arises' - of Vyacheslav Artyomov, which was receiving its world premiere here through his good offices; that, however, was surely misplaced loyalty. Artyomov is yet another Russian composer of whom the West has scarcely heard, but he sounds most unlikely to acquire the almost-overnight fame of Gubaidulina or even Gorecki. His Fourth completes a tetralogy, after 'The Way to Olympus', 'On the Threshold' and 'Gentle Emanation'. The project has a Skryabinesque ring, confirmed by Artyomov's declaration that his music 'is an expression of my inner soul as a composer, and that is how it reflects the soul of the world'. Without wishing to contradict him (for what he writes is doubtless passionately felt), one may add that it also reflects the most ear-catching devices of recently fashionable Western composers. It is a 'symphony' of familiar effects, notable only for squeezing so many of them into one work. It took nearly three-quarters of an hour, of which a record number of minutes outstayed their welcome. It began with stormy churnings, like the more hectic passages in a Skryabin symphony, though there was a sudden echo of Holst's 'Uranus'. (At the close, 'Neptune' would come irresistibly to mind as well, and some Britten and Messiaen surfaced too.) There was an interlude of slow, ticking harps over menacing rumbles, with florid outbursts for unison strings; the climax lay agonisingly high for the violins. A skirling oriental march came and went like an irrelevant memory of Borodin. Eventually the music settled into middle-period Berio mode, almost immobile: long, sustained chords shifting only by a note or two at a time. A groundswell of 'celestial' binging and bonging which had threatened earlier  -Artyomov's percussion is recklessly, self-defeatingly overdone - became a flood, and children's voices sang something uplifting (not identified in the programme). With only a construction of the loosest kind to shore them up, none of these effects seemed more than wilful hectoring. Not much fun.</p>

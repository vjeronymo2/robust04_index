			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Further up the creek BY DITHERING over the future of Rosyth and Devonport, the dockyards where the navy's ships are overhauled, the government has only stoked up public controversy and made its own decision harder. The search to minimise political damage risks producing an unsatisfactory compromise. A decision has been forced by the need for updated facilities to refuel and refit nuclear-powered submarines, including a dock big enough for the new Trident ballistic missile vessels. Since the ministry now envisages a fleet of no more than 16 submarines, it wants just one site to carry out this vital part of the yards' workload. A strong case can be made for either of the privately managed dockyards. Devonport is bigger, part of a larger naval complex than Rosyth's, and argues it can achieve greater efficiency. On the other hand, Rosyth has always looked after Britain's Polaris submarines, is not far by land from the Trident base at Faslane, on the other side of Scotland, and was originally earmarked for the Trident work. Both yards are the dominant employers in unemployment blackspots. But there is no getting around the implications of reduced defence requirements, either in the dockyards or in the private-sector shipbuilders. The outcry over Swan Hunter on Tyneside, in receivership after losing a contract bid last month, cannot change the sad reality that the UK has at least one naval shipbuilder too many. It probably also has twice the specialised refitting capacity it needs. The ministry wants maximum savings and as much competition as possible. These are not as compatible as might appear. There is little doubt among top defence officials that the greatest efficiency would be obtained by consolidating the Pounds 500m-a-year refit programme in a single yard. The impact on the losing region would of course have financial as well as political implications, since it would require large-scale emergency aid. In any event, it is a nettle the government is evidently not prepared to grasp. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, has pledged to keep both yards open, in order to maintain competition for surface ships. But the 'healthy competitive structure' he envisages is unlikely to come about. Having committed itself to both yards, the government will have to guarantee work to the yard that loses the submarine contest, at least for a period. The navy will also have lost an opportunity to change the way it handles the servicing of its frigates and smaller warships. Nuclear submarines require extensive periods in dock, but the modern surface vessels could be maintained with frequent mini-refits. The emerging compromise is designed to keep down short-term costs and share job cuts between the two yards. But it is one in which neither of the two communities, nor the navy, nor in the longer run the taxpayer, will be well-served.</p>

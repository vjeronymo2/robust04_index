			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / International Company News: Controlling interest in Univa to fetch CDollars 200m DEBENTURE holders of Unigesco, the holding company of Mr Bertin Nadeau, the Montreal entrepreneur, have cleared the way for the sale of his 26 per cent controlling stake in Univa, Canada's second biggest food distributor. The stake is changing hands for almost CDollars 200m (USDollars 156m). Mr Nadeau has controlled Univa since 1986 through the heavily indebted Unigesco, his own holding company. Unigesco faces a CDollars 45m debenture maturity this month. Last week, the debenture-holders approved the sale of 26 per cent of Univa plus a general restructuring of Unigesco's borrowings. The buyer of 22.5 per cent of Unigesco was the Caisse de Depot, the Quebec public pension fund manager. The balance of the stake was taken up by the Ontario Teachers Pension Board in exchange for a CDollars 25m Unigesco debenture.</p>

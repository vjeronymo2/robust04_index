			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Management: Spot the tricks of the trade - It pays to be wary of consultants Have you ever employed a consultant who turned out to be an organ-grinder, a Swiss cheese, or a Mercedes? Did he or she 'fake it', use perpetual motion, indulge in role reversal, or employ the 'CIA approach'? You may not know it - even less admit it - but you have almost certainly suffered at the hands of at least one of these phenomena. For they are all variants of the tricks which management consultants have pulled on their clients from time to time. This information comes courtesy of an insider, Michael Grunberg, managing director of Stoy Hayward Consulting, a medium-sized British firm. Though one of the slickest talkers around, Grunberg denies that he or his firm use such tricks of the trade. But he is not ignorant of them. At a meeting last month of the Strand Group, an informal association of in-house consultants for large companies in the UK, Grunberg was invited to give an external perspective of the way consultancy work is bought and used. In an otherwise serious presentation about the ways in which different consultancies operate, he threw in two slides which listed 'the stunts they pull' (with the emphasis on the 'they'). To distance Stoy Hayward further from such practices, he omitted its logo from the slides. The first list covered the 'sales cycle' (selling to clients), and described 13 types of misbehaviour. First came the 'organ grinder' - where the team which does the selling is far more high-powered than the one which actually carries out the assignment. As most clients would confirm, this is far from uncommon. Then there is 'smoke and mirrors': a consultancy claims that its proposed approach, or course of action, is 'structured, sophisticated and proven', but in fact it has yet to be tested. Next come 'gold-plating' (a methodology or activity which is not essential), and the 'trojan horse': a low-cost exercise calculated to 'front-end' further work out of the client. Both are more widespread than Grunberg implied. Leaping a bevy of other intriguing practices, from 'surgical bypass' to 'barrow boy', one arrives at the Mercedes stunt, where the client receives only the basic model and everything else is extra. In the Swiss cheese, consultants leave deliberate gaps in the work they tender, in order to 'facilitate extensions' from the client, as Grunberg put it. Turning to tricks used when a consultant has bid successfully - by whatever means - and is executing an assignment, Grunberg defined 'faking it' as relying on the client's inexperience and lack of knowledge; 'perpetual motion' as staying on forever; role reversal as training on-the-job at the client's expense (which is far from uncommon); and the 'CIA approach' as Consulting in Absentia - sub-contracting the work to others in covert fashion. Then there's 'hidden talent' (the exaggeration of per diem work); 'car service' (the allocation of general overheads as job-specific expenses); and 'carbon copy' - using previous client work without adjusting it. This is one of the most regular (mal)practices of all, too many clients have learned to their cost. Grunberg concluded with a list of tips to clients on how to avoid being taken to the cleaners in these and other ways. They included: know what you want to achieve; write it down; identify the real experts; read their tenders very carefully; evaluate formally and on a range of criteria; and treat consultants as consultants, not 'terrorists' and negotiate with them, 'especially on the detail of the deliverables'. Above all, 'manage the consultancy' and measure its success. Grunberg was too polite to say so, but all that is easier said than done. You may even need a consultant to advise you how to do it.</p>

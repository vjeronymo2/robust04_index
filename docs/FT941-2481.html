			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Probation trainees win Pounds 2.3m payout The Home Office is to pay a total of Pounds 2.3m to 422 trainee probation officers over an alleged breach of contract, the National Association of Probation Officers said yesterday. The association had filed test cases against a decision two years ago to reduce the trainees' income by up to 80 per cent. The reduction followed an Inland Revenue ruling that the trainees were students and not liable to taxation.</p>

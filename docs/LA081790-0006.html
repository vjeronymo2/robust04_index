			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PALMDALE PLAN FOR TEEN-AGE CENTER RUNS INTO DELAY  </P> <P> A long-awaited plan for Palmdale's first indoor recreation center for  teen-agers faltered Thursday night when the City Council delayed action on a  proposal to lease and remodel a former downtown toy store.  </P> <P> Despite months of negotiations, city officials said they had been unable to  reach a lease agreement with the owner of the building. That news cast further  doubt on prospects for an early opening of a center many residents say is  desperately needed.  </P> <P> "We're so far apart on so many different things," said Alex Kaminar, the Van  Nuys businessman who owns the building sought by the city. Kaminar said issues  other than the basic $162,000 first-year price for the lease are in dispute.  But he and city officials refused to elaborate.  </P> <P> Many parents, teen-agers and city officials in the Antelope Valley community  have long complained that the city, despite its tremendous growth, has no  indoor recreation facilities where youngsters can play sports or just socialize  in a supervised setting.  </P> <P> The city wants a 10-year lease for Kaminar's vacant, 32,000-square-foot  building in Palmdale Plaza, a rundown shopping center near City Hall. The  building at 815 E. Avenue Q-6 for years had been a supermarket, and more  recently a toy store, which closed earlier this year.  </P> <P> The lease had been scheduled to be acted upon by the council a week ago but was  continued. It was again on Thursday night's agenda, but council members pulled  the item from their regular agenda and held a 50-minute, closed-door discussion  before returning to announce another delay.  </P> <P> City Administrator Robert Toone said he hoped the lease deal might be concluded  by the council's next meeting on Sept. 13, but gave no assurances. Should that  occur, though, the center still might not open for many months because of the  time needed to transform the building.  </P> <P> The city expects to spend about $742,000 to prepare the building and operate it  for the first nine months, including nearly $284,000 for remodeling, $233,000  for operating expenses, $176,000 for staff and $49,000 for equipment. City  officials said it would then cost about $500,000 per year to operate  thereafter.  </P> <P> City officials also said they hope the recreation center plan, along with a  separate city plan to lease another adjoining store for a new city library,  will help restore some luster to a complex that was the valley's first shopping  center when it opened in the late 1950s.  </P> <P> John Lasagna, city parks and recreation director, said the city hopes to  operate the center seven days a week, including night hours on most days. Plans  include two basketball courts, areas for volleyball, badminton and activities  classes, and a snack bar and music for teen-agers.  </P> <P> Palmdale, despite its population of about 56,000, has neither a city-run  gymnasium nor a municipal recreation center. Its only indoor basketball courts  are those at local schools, and the city's popular recreation classes and  programs are crowded into several city buildings.  </P></p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / International Company News: Saab-Scania surges despite sales dip SAAB-SCANIA, the Swedish vehicle and aerospace group, has turned in a substantial improvement in its profits after financial items for the first quarter of the year. Yesterday it reported a SKr610m (Dollars 103.4m) result, compared with SKr270m for the same period of 1991. There was a 5 per cent decrease in consolidated sales, to SKr6.58bn from SKr6.94bn. Return on capital rose slightly to 11.6 per cent from 11.2 per cent. The group said its forecast for 1992 was unchanged, with prospects of 'achieving an improved result', mainly due to last year's restructuring measures. With the likelihood of a 10 to 15 per cent drop in heavy truck sales this year in western Europe, mainly because of a falling off in demand in the German market, Saab-Scania announced a slight drop in its total truck and bus sales, to SKr5.32bn from SKr5.35bn. The company also reported a 16 per cent decline in aircraft sales, to SKr992m in the first quarter compared with SKr1.18bn for the same period of 1991. At the end of March, there was an order backlog for aircraft valued at SKr11bn compared with SKr12.7bn for the same date in 1991. Firm orders for the new Saab 2000 civilian aircraft, with the first deliveries scheduled for autumn 1993, now amount to 46, with a further 148 in options. Last week's orders for 110 more JAS 39 Gripen fighter aircraft for the Swedish air force has strengthened the company's sales position. There was also an 18 per cent drop in sales in the group's Combitech division, to SKr512m from SKr622m, though with an order backlog of SKr3.30bn at the end of March.</p>

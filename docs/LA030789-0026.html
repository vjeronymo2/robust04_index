			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> NOTRE DAME STUNS CHATSWORTH, 6-5  </P> <P> Notre Dame High rallied for two runs in each of the last three innings Monday  to shock Chatsworth, 6-5, in the second round of the Westside baseball  tournament at Chatsworth.  </P> <P> The Knights' victory, however, was not without controversy, which was generated  by a fifth-inning balk by Chatsworth right-hander Reed McMackin that resulted  in Notre Dame's second run.  </P> <P> With two out and Chatsworth leading, 4-1, Notre Dame's Vinnie Orlando was  allowed to score from third after McMackin halted his wind-up. The second base  umpire made the call, unaware that the home plate umpire had apparently raised  his hand to signal time out.  </P> <P> "You put your hand up!" said Chatsworth Coach Bob Lofrano, who protested for  five minutes.  </P> <P> Said Lofrano afterward: "He agreed that he put up his hand. He justified it by  saying he didn't yell, 'Time!' "  </P> <P> Said McMackin: "I'm in my wind-up, I take a step back, drop my head like I  always do and when I look up his hand is up. There is no reason anybody -- I  don't care who you are -- stops in the middle of a wind-up with a runner at  third base."  </P> <P> Notre Dame Coach Bob Mandeville seemed to agree. "If an umpire raises a hand to  my pitcher, I expect my pitcher to stop."  </P> <P> Notre Dame sophomore right-hander Cary Wichman stopped Chatsworth with an  effective curve. Wichman struggled early, as Chatsworth (1-1) struck for two  first-inning runs on two hits. Wichman (1-0), however, went the distance,  scattering four hits.  </P> <P> "The curve was working real good," Wichman said. "We mixed it in a lot."  </P> <P> Chatsworth scored two runs in the fourth inning to take a 4-0 lead. Senior  Kevin Chong, who was three for four, singled to right field to drive in  pinch-runner Chris Husted from third. The ball rolled between the legs of right  fielder Chris Prince, allowing Nick Schultz to score from first.  </P> <P> Notre Dame (2-0) parlayed three singles into two sixth-inning runs to tie the  score. Chatsworth added an unearned run in the bottom half of the sixth, but  Notre Dame scored twice in the seventh.  </P> <P> With two out and runners on first and third, Notre Dame's Kevin Milligan  reached base when catcher Eric Johnson dropped what would have been a  game-ending third strike from reliever Jason Evans (0-1). Chris Lohman scored  from third.  </P> <P> Prince then atoned for his error with a single to score Bobby Hughes with the  winning run. VINCE KOWALICK  </P></p>

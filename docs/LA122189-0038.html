			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RETURNING TO YESTERYEAR WITH THE TOYS OF CHILDHOOD;  </P> <P> COLLECTIBLES: IN A TREND THAT'S PART NOSTALGIA, PART PROFIT, DEMAND FOR  YESTERDAY'S PLAYTHINGS IS UP.  </P> <P> Memories of toys from childhoods long past come surging to the fore this time  of year: the train set that circled the Christmas tree in 1959, the shiny  silver cap gun that transformed a runny-nosed kid into Hopalong Cassidy, or the  toy soldiers that once stood guard against dirt-clod assaults.  </P> <P> But memories are all that most adults have of these toys, unless they happen to  belong to the growing ranks of those who collect them. Toys are in demand --  whether they are dolls, radio premiums, trains, airplanes or cap guns -- partly  because of nostalgia and partly for their collectible value.  </P> <P> A recent edition of Antique Toy World magazine contained 10 pages of classified  ads offering to sell or buy toys, and listed more than 140 dates for toy shows  from such places as Kansas, New Jersey and Texas to Pomona and West Hollywood.  </P> <P> Bill Hamburg, 50, is a gun collector.  </P> <P> When guests first see his toy gun collection, which fills the gun room in his  Woodland Hills home, "most people discover they still have that little child  inside them," says Hamburg. "Then they try and find their old cap gun from  their childhood."  </P> <P> Hamburg, a sales manager for the Southern California Gas Co., became interested  in cap guns while rummaging around a Washington state antique store on vacation  seven years ago with his wife, Loretta. He spotted a Hubley 50-shot Texan  six-shooter, a duplicate of the first cap gun he owned as a child. It was in  excellent shape, but he didn't like the $35 price tag, so he reluctantly  passed.  </P> <P> The chance cap gun encounter started him collecting, first the cap guns he  remembered as a child in the late 1940s, then others. Today, his earliest  examples include an 1870 double-hammer pistol and a cast-iron 1887 Penny  Pistol, so named because of it cost 1 cent.  </P> <P> While Hamburg's collection has all sizes and shapes of cap guns, including  models embossed with such names as Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, the Lone Ranger and  Hopalong Cassidy, he says the most unusual are the animated ones made as  novelties, not for children.  </P> <P> One such cap gun, from the 1880s, has a cast-iron human figure about 1 1/2  inches tall standing on the barrel. The gun goes off when the hammer strikes a  cap that sits on the man's head.  </P> <P> Two cap guns in his collection mean more to Hamburg than the nearly 300 others.  </P> <P> The first is a cap pistol his father played with as a young boy, and the other,  one of a dozen cap guns neatly displayed on a small glass table, is the Hubley  Texan he first spotted in Washington.  </P> <P> "I just had this urge to own it," he says. He drove back to the store a year  later, without calling first, still hoping it would be there.  </P> <P> Roger Steiner, 45, owns three dozen trucks, specifically Smith-Miller toy  trucks made in the 1940s and '50s from die-cast aluminum. The two-foot-long  vehicles were patterned after then-current prototypes, including moving vans,  tank trucks, army vehicles and lumber trucks.  </P> <P> "A friend gave me one in so-so shape about eight years ago," says the West  Valley resident, "and it reminded me of one I had when I was a kid. Restoring  it rekindled a lot of old memories."  </P> <P> While complete models in good shape are becoming scarce, Steiner says  replacement parts have been easy to find since Valley resident Fred Thompson  purchased in 1978 the stored remains of the Smith-Miller company, which went  out of business in the mid-1950s. Besides replacement parts, Thompson also has  been offering new truck models.  </P> <P> Steiner tries to buy the trucks as cheaply as possible, knowing it will take  about 40 hours of filing, bending, cleaning and undoing decades of disuse to  return them to displayable shape.  </P> <P> Steiner is constantly looking for more trucks to add to the collection that is  displayed on boards mounted on the wall of his bedroom. Browsing through a  hobby magazine or wandering around toy shows, he keeps his eye out for trucks,  especially some of the older Chevy-style designs made in the late 1940s.  "They're getting hard to find in any shape," he says, "especially now that  people are realizing their value."  </P> <P> Louis Steinberg's fond childhood memories rekindled a desire to collect  three-inch-tall, pot-metal, dime store soldiers.  </P> <P> "They were made as toys you plunked a nickel or dime down at the store for,"  says the 59-year-old Chatsworth resident, "so they were meant to be played  with. As children, we bombed, threw rocks and aimed marbles at them."  </P> <P> The young Steinberg also made his own soldiers by pouring melted tire-balancing  weights and foil from Lucky Strike cigarette packs into molds borrowed from a  friend.  </P> <P> But when Steinberg grew up, he left them behind, until 20 years ago when he  came across a Glendale garage sale that had, among other items, pot-metal, dime  store soldiers.  </P> <P> "I had forgotten all about them," he says. "They were exactly what I  remembered, and in excellent condition." He purchased all 15 soldiers for less  than 50 cents apiece. Today, Steinberg can't say how many soldiers are in his  collection, except that he has "uncounted thousands."  </P> <P> Although there were dozens of small manufacturers, two, Barclay and Manoil,  were the largest, Steinberg says. While all the figures were known as  "soldiers," the various companies sold non-military figures as well, including  doctors, nurses and lumberjacks. His rarest piece is a Barclay deep-sea diver  holding an ax that he estimates is worth $300. Refurbished soldiers in good  condition go for about $10.  </P> <P> Someday, he hopes to display his soldiers in dioramas; a few are in custom  cases. Most are stored in neatly stacked cardboard boxes in closets throughout  his home.  </P> <P> "It's like any other collectible," he says. "Hopefully, one day I'll have the  joy of having them displayed."  </P> <P> North Hollywood dentist Dr. Hillel (Hilly) Lazarus, 54, regularly visits toy  train conventions to add to his tin-plate train collection.  </P> <P> Owning more than 200 locomotives and about 1,000 freight and passenger cars,  Lazarus admits that he wasn't too careful with his first tin-plate train, which  "bit the dust in the sandbox," when he was 3 years old. He can produce a  picture of himself in the sandbox with the train to prove it.  </P> <P> Lazarus prefers to collect the lesser-known pre-World War II American Flyer O  gauge track, which was manufactured from 1907-42, to the more popularly known  Lionel tin-plated iron and steel track.  </P> <P> Lazarus collects not for the investment value but for his love of trains.  </P> <P> "The nostalgic binge of the last 10 years has changed people's perceptions," he  says. "Now instead of being an interesting hobby, some people just see dollar  signs."  </P> <P> Hoping to eventually display his trains -- everything is currently in storage  -- Lazarus is active in toy train associations and can usually be found  attending area swap meets.  </P> <P> When people learn of his hobby, Lazarus says they usually comment, "I had one  just like that when I was a kid," That's easier to take than the second  most-heard line: "We used to have one like that, but we threw it away."  </P> <P> Burbank writer Jim Harmon, 56, has been a collector all his life. Some of his  600-piece radio premium collection contains items he sent away for as kid  growing up in Mt. Carmel, Ill.  </P> <P> "Basically it started with Little Orphan Annie in 1931. 'Send me an Ovaltine  seal and a dime, and I'll send you a shake-up mug for your Ovaltine,' " he  says, recalling the premium advertisement.  </P> <P> The popularity of radio premiums rose and fell with radio dramas, and the last  of them, which evaporated with the beginning of television, were offered in the  late 1950s.  </P> <P> "It was a form of a ratings service," says Harmon, explaining why sponsors  offered premiums. "There was no profit, and the cost of the premium had to stay  in the advertising budget. They just wanted to run a survey of how many kids  were listening."  </P> <P> Whatever the sponsors' motivations, it was a delight to kids, says Harmon, with  almost every show at one time or another offering everything from drinking mugs  to dioramas, rings, telescopes and pedometers.  </P> <P> Some of his most prized pieces are the premiums that flopped.  </P> <P> When "Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy" offered a telescope, millions were  mailed out, Harmon says. But when the same sponsor offered a gardenia bracelet  for girls that would glow in the dark, it was a bomb. Only about 200 were  requested; Harmon has copies of the cereal company's records to prove it. The  premium was withdrawn after two days.  </P> <P> Harmon figures the most popular radio premium giveaways were from the most  popular show, cowboy Tom Mix and his horse Tony on "The Tom Mix Show,"  sponsored by Ralston Purina. "They gave away premiums almost every month,"  Harmon says, including a wooden model of Mix's six-shooter, which the collector  owns, of course.  </P> <P> Harmon's personal favorite is the cardboard and paper Lone Ranger frontier  town, given away by the sponsor Cheerios, which duplicates one he had as a  child.  </P> <P> "You had to locate nine different numbers on nine different packages of  Cheerios and then send in for four different kits with nine box tops to get  everything, including the sheriff's office, the stage line office -- 66  buildings in all -- and you could follow the Lone Ranger's adventures on your  model. Mother was very supportive," he says with a laugh. In one of those "I  don't know why I did it" moments in his 20s, Harmon threw out the set. Now,  he's finally gotten all the pieces of another one.  </P> <P> "I've been slowly setting it up. It's so big, my wife said I could set it up on  the dining-room table, but then I wouldn't know where we'd eat."  </P></p>

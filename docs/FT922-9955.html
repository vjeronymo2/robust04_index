			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Bank Vontobel sees higher income BANK J Vontobel &amp; Co, a leading Zurich investment bank, expects to reverse a two-year profit slide this year in spite of difficult trading conditions in Swiss financial markets, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. 'We are expecting higher income this year,' Mr Oskar Holenweger, chief executive, said at the bank's annual news conference, adding that first quarter results were 'comfortably over budget'. Net income of Bank Vontobel in 1991 dropped 8.6 per cent to SFr13.8m (Dollars 9.1m), mainly because of the erosion of margins in brokerage operations following the removal of fixed commissions from Swiss securities transactions at the beginning of 1991. The bank's net commission income dropped 9.4 per cent to SFr83.7m. Income from portfolio management and custodial services was flat at SFr30.7m while that from new issues and miscellaneous commissions jumped 30.6 per cent to SFr20.5m. Net interest income halved to SFr6.5m, partly because of internal infrastructure investments, but income from trading soared to SFr22.6m from SFr5m. Despite the bank's weaker earnings, consolidated net income of the Vontobel group soared from SFr6.3m to SFr22.3m, excluding an extraordinary SFr15m transfer from hidden reserves in the previous year. Mr Walter Kaeser, chief financial officer, attributed the gain to improved earnings of other subsidiaries and from the treasury operations of the parent company, Vontobel Holding. Profits on treasury operations jumped from SFr2.7m in 1990 to SFr16.1m last year. Vontobel Holding's net income in its fiscal year to March 31, 1992, rose 4.4 per cent last year to SFr14.1m.</p>

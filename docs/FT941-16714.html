			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Companies increasingly willing to help promote training effort Sir, David Soskice's article, 'UK's wrong turning on training' (January 6), outlined persuasively why British industrial employers have been historically less committed and involved in vocational training than their international competitors. That the UK is lagging behind is not disputed. He concludes, however, that our employers will not, indeed cannot, change; therefore the education system must continue to bail them out. The UK cannot afford to adopt such a defeatist stance. I believe the growing acceptance by companies large and small of the need to commit themselves to being 'investors in people', systematically developing the skills and potential of their workforces, demonstrates a potential change in industry's approach to skill development. This is a long overdue and welcome revolution that needs everyone's support. The article also appears to suggest that the high-level vocational qualifications that will be achieved through the proposed modern apprenticeship will in some way be of lower value than traditional educational qualifications. This is quite incorrect. Vocational qualifications measure and accredit the application of knowledge learned - knowledge often learned quite rightly at educational institutions. Indeed, they are a natural development of the successful 'applied learning' courses that were the hallmark of polytechnics in the 1970s and 1980s. We must move away from the damaging either/or, or 'better than' debate. There is a need to encourage everyone to achieve higher qualifications, vocational and (so-called) academic. As such, the proposed modern apprenticeship offers another route to which many will, for the first time, be prepared to say 'yes'. Finally, the assertion that the UK needs organisational and computing, rather than vocational, skills cannot be left unchallenged. The former are vocational skills. The challenge is that both higher education offerings and apprenticeships must deliver these with full employer support.

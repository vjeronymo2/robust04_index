			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Contract complaints dismissed The Mexican Comptroller General of the Federation has concluded that there is no basis to accusations of irregularities in the awarding of an air traffic control contract of Dollars 21m to Thomson of France and Alenia of Italy, Damian Fraser and Stephen Fidler write from Mexico City. Nor is there evidence to support a claim that government officials had sought bribes, the Comptroller said. Five multinationals had complained that the first tender offer was unjustifiably cancelled in November last year.</p>

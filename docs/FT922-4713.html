			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Dowty and TI in war of words DOWTY GROUP, the aero-space and information technology company, began the last week of its defence against the hostile takeover bid from TI by accusing its suitor of under-estimating Dowty's ability to recover from the recession. In a circular to shareholders Dowty also said that if shareholders accepted the TI offer their income would fall by 41 per cent, due to the lower yield on TI shares. TI immediately dismissed the circular, saying Dowty's higher-than-expected Pounds 29m profit estimate for the year to March 1992 was well within the range anticipated before the bid. A TI adviser also said Dowty's argument about yield took no account of the potential capital gain from holding TI shares and that shareholders should consider their total return on investment. 'This latest statement from Dowty is a damp squib,' TI said. TI said its offer valued Dowty at a multiple of 30 this year's estimated profits. TI's shares rose 12p to 357p, partly in sympathy with the rise in the share price of Siebe, the engineering group. Dowty's shares rose 3p to 176p, above the 175p per share value of the cash alternative. In its circular Dowty said it saw little or no premium in the price offered by TI. Management had already taken much of the action that TI said it would take and that it had a different management from that which had put Dowty into its difficulties. TI has consistently rejected this argument.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment states that the mandatory incorporation of the fan blade shroud angle rework to 52 degrees as described in PW SB No. 72&hyph;309 should be relaxed from within two years after the effective date of this AD to the next engine shop visit, thereby reducing the potential for on-wing maintenance induced error. The FAA does not concur. The FAA has determined that it is necessary to expeditiously remove fan blades with the 62 degree shroud configuration, thereby reducing the potential for operating the fan blade in flutter. The FAA has reviewed a risk analysis study that indicates that a two-year time period for incorporating this modification is required to lower the risk sufficiently to avert future potential uncontained fan blade failures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes described previously. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 730 PW JT9D&hyph;7R4 series engines of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 220 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry would be affected by this AD, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. The inspections required by this AD will take approximately 1.6 work hours per engine. The blade rework will cost approximately $15,600 per engine. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $3,451,360. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket.

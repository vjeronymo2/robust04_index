			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Madrid-Seville fast rail link heads for profit: The success of Spain's high-speed train gives hope to the makers of Germany's Transrapid Billed as a white elephant, the AVE, Spain's high-speed train between Madrid and Seville, is confounding its critics. The AVE almost broke even in its first full year of service and it is set to become one of the few profitable units in the deficit-ridden railway network. According to provisional 1993 results, the AVE generated income of Pta13.5bn (Pounds 65m) and reported losses of Pta90m after paying back Pta4.3bn on loans to acquire the 16 trains it operates, similar to those running on France's Train a Grande Vitesse (TGV) system and built by the same Anglo-French engineering group, GEC-Alsthom. This year the high-speed train unit aims to raise its total number of passengers by 24 per cent to nearly 4m and to post a profit. By 1998, with expected income of more than Pta22bn, the unit says it will have paid off its Pta45bn rolling stock investment. The Pta450bn construction bill for the 471km link between Madrid and Seville - a track built to the narrower European gauge specifications and which includes 17km of tunnels and 32 viaducts - has been picked up by the Transport Ministry. 'There has been an incredible difference between the speculation that surrounded the AVE and what has turned out to be the reality,' said Mr Jose Alberto Zaragoza, the planning chief at the Transport Ministry. The decision to build the link, which opened in time for Seville's Expo '92 Universal Exposition, prompted critics to charge that Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez had favoured his home town and ignored economic common sense which dictated linking Madrid to Barcelona, twice as wealthy and as large as Seville, and to the French frontier. The government countered that the AVE had been routed to Seville to prevent the underdeveloped south decoupling from the richer north and officials dubbed the policy the 'Mezzogiorno factor' after the regional imbalances in Italy that Spain wanted to prevent. It was 'a very political decision', said Mr Zaragoza. AVE's success, which has slashed the railway travel time between Madrid and Seville from 5 hours and 55 minutes to 2 hours and 40 minutes, has underlined the lessons learnt by France's experiment. The high-speed train captures the largest share of the travel market. Before AVE went into service, 51 per cent of travellers between Madrid and Seville used a car and 20 per cent went by train; now 39 per cent drive and 44 per cent take the AVE. Air travel is particularly penalised by competition from a high-speed train link. Before the AVE, Iberia, the domestic carrier, accounted for 18 per cent of Madrid-Seville travel. This has dropped to 7 per cent and the airline, which has already cut its 71 flights a week between the two cities to 64, plans to reduce them to 52. High-speed trains generate new customers. Of AVE users 24 per cent had never previously travelled between Madrid and Seville. Building on the AVE's success, the Transport Ministry has given the green light to the Madrid-French frontier link, which should be completed by 2003.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE TALE OF TWO TRAINS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SPAIN                 The AVE: reduces the 470km trip between Madrid &amp;                       Seville from about six hours to two hours and                       forty minutes GERMANY               The Transrapid: aims to cut the 300km journey                       between Berlin &amp; Hamburg from three and a half                       hours to less than an hour  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

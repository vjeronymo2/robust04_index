			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Colefax &amp; Fowler falls into the red COLEFAX &amp; Fowler Group, the upmarket wallpaper, fabric and furnishing group, fell into the red in the six months to October 31, turning from pre-tax profits of Pounds 505,000 to losses of Pounds 192,000. The shares fell 5p to 33p, a far cry from their 180p high in 1989-90 when pre-tax profits peaked at Pounds 4m. Mr David Green, chairman, said the period was 'a little gloomy but the worst is behind us'. Although there were few signs of a turnround in trading conditions, the interim losses were said to be no more than a hiccup, and the balance sheet was strong. Turnover declined from Pounds 14.8m to Pounds 13.9m. Losses per share were 0.76p, against earnings of 2p, and the interim dividend is reduced from 1.3p to 0.5p. Sales in the US, responsible for 50 per cent of turnover, had been weak, although business in December was stronger, and the group's decorating operations had suffered in particular. 'The UK market is still tough and Europe is not encouraging,' Mr Green said. Jane Churchill, the mid-price wallpaper and fabric brand, was showing improved sales, and the devaluation in sterling would help sales on the Continent and in the US. However, only renewed confidence in the housing market would restore the growth, as sales were largely dependent on people redecorating their homes as they moved house.</p>

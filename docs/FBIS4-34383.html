			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 17 Jun (EFE) -- Chilean Foreign Minister  Carlos Figueroa said today that the situation of the Chilean  Consulate in Havana, which is occupied by eight Cubans, remains  unchanged. Figueroa added that both foreign ministries continue  to be in contact to try to find a definitive solution.    During a meeting with the local press, Figueroa said the  basic discussion on the issue is "the upholding of international  law," which has always characterized Chilean foreign policy.    Foreign Minister Figueroa said the Cuban citizens, who have  been occupying the Chilean Consulate since 15 June, are not  under asylum. He said this is a humanitarian gesture on the part  of Chile and the situation will continue until a reasonable  solution is found.    Figueroa added that because of the Cuban Government's  refusal  to grant safe conduct papers to allow the refugees to abandon  the island, Chilean Consul Patricio Pozo has urged the refugees  to leave the consulate peacefully. Figueroa stated that Pozo  also has assured the refugees that the Cuban Government has  promised not to take reprisals against them.    Asked whether the Chilean Government has established a  certain deadline for solving the issue, Figueroa said no  deadlines have been established, only objectives.    He said that one of these objectives is to achieve a  peaceful  solution and the other is to offer guarantees for the eight  Cubans occupying the building.    Foreign Minister Figueroa stated: "We want to avoid making  any explicit statement encouraging the occupation of other  consulates or embassies."    Asked whether the Chilean Government will require Cuba to  "adopt steps toward democracy" as a prior step before resuming  diplomatic ties at the ambassadorial level, Figueroa said: "At  no time has the Chilean Government made such a proposal to Cuba."    Chile and Cuba severed their diplomatic ties on 11 September  1973. They restored diplomatic ties at the consular level in  July 1991 after then-Chilean President Patricio Aylwin met Fidel  Castro within the framework of the first Ibero-American Summit,  held in Guadalajara, Mexico.</p>

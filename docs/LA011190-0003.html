			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AL MARTINEZ: CIAO TO THE CHARDONNAY RAIDERS  </P> <P> I like watching football as well as the next guy, requiring as it does no  special capacity to think, evaluate or otherwise rise to new heights of  intellectual or spiritual achievement.  </P> <P> Those who repair washing machines can enjoy the sport on an equal basis with  Ph.Ds in astrophysics, jumping and shouting with the airy enthusiasm of  children at play.  </P> <P> There is an egalitarian quality to the sport, much as there is to a religious  gathering, and all can gather to pray or cheer regardless of race, creed or an  ability to read and write.  </P> <P> When the cheering or praying ends, we go our separate ways, of course, but at  least our souls have touched for a moment like angels in flight, and there  might be something to be said for that.  </P> <P> But I ask you: Is any group of young men whose only obvious talents lie in  their ability to run, kick, block or catch worth about $200 million to keep in  town?  </P> <P> I think not.  </P> <P> I refer, of course, to efforts under way to persuade the Raiders to remain in  Los Angeles -- including Wednesday's offer to rebuild the Coliseum -- or at  least to replace them with another football team of equal virtuosity.  </P> <P> That shouldn't be difficult, since they've been playing like zombies most of  the seven years they've been in L.A. Even in moments of triumph they manage to  seem incredibly dull. How expensive should zombies be?  </P> <P> It isn't just the won-lost record I'm talking about.  </P> <P> The Raiders never belonged here in the first place. They were champions in  Oakland, a town that still drinks boilermakers, but wilted like roses in the  desert in a city that sips white wine.  </P> <P> Wasp-witted Jerry Belcher, who had a name for everything, began referring to  them as the Chardonnay Raiders when they came to L.A., such was the languor of  their style under the palm trees.  </P> <P> In their days up north, the team won a reputation for being quick and rough and  giving no quarter. If football is a game of Christians and lions, it was best  to be lions, and the Raiders were just that.  </P> <P> Theirs was a survival syndrome that reflected the city in which they were born  and in which they rose to new heights of Sunday violence.  </P> <P> Ain't that what sport is all about?  </P> <P> Oakland grew up using its back rather than its wit, and thrives today because  it has never stopped struggling. It's a town that eats steak, not quiche, and  would still rather see Tempest Storm twirl her tassels than Jane Fonda flatten  her behind.  </P> <P> When the Raiders left in 1982, it was like Oakland's heart had been ripped out.  Almost everybody seems to leave Oakland. Even Amelia Earhart took off one day  and never came back.  </P> <P> Los Angeles, on the other hand, is big and rich and loaded with more of  everything than St. Elvis has disciples, and the Raiders reflect that. We don't  struggle, we do lunches. We don't take chances, we take meetings.  </P> <P> We shuffle around in Gucci loafers, boost our egos with silicone breast  implants and would rather die than do without a tummy tuck.  </P> <P> L.A. is oat bran, Oakland is a baloney sandwich. L.A. is Sunset Boulevard,  Oakland is East 14th Street. They founded the Hell's Angels, we gave the world  the Flying Nun.  </P> <P> The Raiders belong in a town that sweats and spits, not in one that watches its  complex carbohydrates. I say send them sailing back to Oakland with a  tippy-fingers high five and wish them raw meat for lunch off the Nimitz  Freeway.  </P> <P> Now about that $200 million that seems so readily available to build a new  stadium and to sweeten the tea of the team that occupies it. We don't need  another football team to enhance a city's big-league style.  </P> <P> The Anaheim Rams are near enough to satisfy any residual urge for a bunch of  guys who can crack heads and break legs with impunity. We've got bone-crushers  enough.  </P> <P> What we don't have is a full medical facility dedicated to the cure of AIDS and  to the treatment of its victims.  </P> <P> What we don't have is adequate housing facilities for those on the streets, or  enough places to feed the hungry in an economically lopsided society.  </P> <P> Our list of needs would light the fires of hell for eternity, but the  alleviation of those needs could brighten heaven beyond time.  </P> <P> Channeling money to alleviate despair won't result in bankable profit. No one's  going to get rich. But it would enhance the city's image as big league in a way  that football never could. It would be an investment in human resources that  not even a touchdown in the Super Bowl could surpass.  </P> <P> So ciao to the Chardonnay Raiders. Let them go back to Oakland or to wherever  the caprice of cash takes them, while we ponder the value of the money we were  willing to spend to keep them . . . and come out winners without them.  </P></p>

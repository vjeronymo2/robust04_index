			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE BEBOP: TINY CULTURAL FLAME FLICKERS OUT  </P> <P> The telephone has been ringing nonstop at Bebop Records and Fine Art this week.  Owner Richard Bruland answers and says pretty much the same thing every time.  </P> <P> "I've got some bad news. I have to cancel your show," Bruland tells the  musician or poet who was scheduled to perform at Bebop. "Don't take it  personally. I have to cancel every show."  </P> <P> For eight years, Bruland has struggled to make ends meet at his Reseda  used-record store on Sherman Way, which nightly becomes an unusually eclectic  performance space for poetry and music. Now, he is giving up the fight. Bebop  will close at month's end.  </P> <P> The police came into the shop last week, during a concert by the Apache  Dancers, and informed Bruland that he was providing entertainment without the  required cafe entertainment permit. Officers suggested that he could obtain  such a permit and continue with business as usual.  </P> <P> But Bruland said he can't afford to stay open without offering entertainment  for the three weeks it takes to complete the application process. Rent is due  on July 1, and he has lost his primary source of income -- concert audiences  bought most of the records that Bebop sold each month and gave occasional  donations. The 43-year-old shopkeeper said he "can read the writing on the  wall."  </P> <P> "The store's financial situation has been grim for a long time," he said. "I  had to scrape together change for gas to get home last night."  </P> <P> Bebop has long been a favored San Fernando Valley hangout. The work of local  artists hangs on the walls above record bins. The shop, which has a tiny stage  at the back and room for 49 folding chairs, has hosted performances by  well-known musicians such as Los Lobos, Exene Cervenka and Jane's Addiction.  Literary figures such as Jim Carroll and Kate Braverman have read there.  </P> <P> Just as often, Bruland booked new poets and bands -- like Victor Banana, sam i  am and Zoogz Rift -- that no other club would take.  </P> <P> Audiences at Bebop tended to be small -- a dozen or so people on a given night  -- and quietly respectful.  </P> <P> "It's not a bar. That's good. More people are getting into sobriety and a more  thoughtful way of viewing things," said Cervenka, the former lead singer of X  who appeared at a Bebop benefit three months ago. "It's ironic that the police  are threatened by a place like this. It's as if they're afraid of a sober,  intellectual atmosphere."  </P> <P> Eric Lydon and Kevin Bartnof said Bebop was the first shop that would sell  their underground poetry magazine, The Moment, when it came out in 1987.  Bruland often took time before performances to tell customers about the  journal.  </P> <P> "He gave lots of people a chance," Bartnof said.  </P> <P> Bebop had been holding regular poetry nights since 1984, when such events had  not yet become a celebrity-approved activity in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "It was a boheme hangout, the sole gathering place for Valley underground  types," Lydon said. "You'd think the cops would have something better to do  than hassle a small business."  </P> <P> Bruland insists that he doesn't blame the police. He suspects their visit was  prompted by the recent discotheque fire in New York City, where 87 people were  killed in an unlicensed and illegally run club.  </P> <P> "The police were just doing their job," he said. "I've been expecting them to  show up for a while."  </P> <P> Though the shop had been open since 1982, police said they only recently became  aware that it was hosting nighttime concerts. Vice detectives from the West  Valley division walked in the door last Friday at 10 p.m.  </P> <P> "We were playing and we didn't realize what was happening," said Bernadette  Colmine, of the Apache Dancers, a country-rock band with Edith Piaf influences.  "They did it all quietly out in the street.  </P> <P> "Afterward, we talked to Richard," she said. "He was upset because he knew that  if he could not have performances, he could not survive on just the record  store. We were really upset to have been there at the end."  </P> <P> Like other groups, the Apache Dancers enjoyed Bebop for its intimate setting.  Most bands, no matter what their style, played acoustic sets there.  </P> <P> "It was like playing in the living room and I'm going to miss that," Colmine  said. "There should be more and more places like that rather than less and  less."  </P> <P> As he prepares to pack up, the quiet-spoken Bruland said he is looking forward  to spending more time with his own art, painting. Still, he couldn't help  reminiscing about countless evenings spent listening to music and poetry. He  recalled the time three years ago when La Loca, then unknown, showed up at an  open-mike poetry night.  </P> <P> "In walks this mysterious woman," he said. "She got up on stage and proceeded  to mesmerize everybody."  </P> <P> There were nights when local favorites, either poets or bands, attracted  sold-out crowds. Other times, little-known musicians played solo . . .  literally.  </P> <P> "I've had more nights than I care to think about when there was nobody in the  audience," he said. "But some of the best performances have been with two or  three people in the audience."  </P> <P> The first time Mary's Danish appeared at Bebop, several years ago, only 15  people came. The band, which is now successful, was then newly formed.  </P> <P> "They were as nervous as can be," Bruland said. "But you could tell that they  were intent on doing their best."  </P> <P> Thus, Mary's Danish measured up to Bruland's Law of Good Music: "I want  performers who, at the end of the evening, I feel I know more about them as  persons, as opposed to knowing more about where they buy their clothes or where  they get their hair done."  </P> <P> Though Bruland refuses to criticize any form of music, such comments are a  thinly veiled reference to heavy metal and its attendant culture. Bebop has  never hosted such music, which is ironic because the shop operated all these  years in the shadow of the Country Club, a large and successful heavy-metal  club down the street.  </P> <P> "I prefer to think that I cast my own shadow," Bruland said. "My own shadow was  maybe smaller, but just as dark."  </P></p>

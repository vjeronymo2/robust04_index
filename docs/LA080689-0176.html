			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A 'CITY' OF SURVIVORS;  </P> <P> THE WEST'S SECOND CITY IS IN THE BLACK DESPITE DEFECTIONS IN THE RANKS  </P> <P> Five months ago, the Second City comedy troupe launched its first major  invasion of the West Coast and established a beachhead at the old Mayfair  Theatre in Santa Monica, bringing with it lots of promise and plenty of  questions.  </P> <P> The promise had to do with the troupe's potential for pumping fresh air into  the torpid inversion layer that the entertainment industry here casts over  talent, enveloping and invisibly affecting it. It also had to do with Second  City's capacity to offer local audiences a linkup with their experience that  could bypass television and the movies.  </P> <P> The main question, simply put, was whether the ensemble could survive.  </P> <P> After five months, it's still here and still, in many respects -- mainly  commercial -- healthy. But the company has suffered attrition and in its revues  hasn't yet come up with a personal style and point of view -- indispensable  elements of first-rate work.  </P> <P> What the troupe seemed most concerned about when it arrived in February was  defection in the ranks, and that's happened. Robin Duke, Chris Barnes and Dana  Anderson have stayed on, but Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake have left for commercial  acting jobs. John Hemphill has gone home to Toronto either to work on a  screenplay or take care of personal finances or because he became homesick --  it depends on whom you ask. (He declined to give an interview.)  </P> <P> For 30 years, no other comedy group has supplied more major talent to America's  entertainment scene than Second City, which opened its doors in 1959 in what  was once a Chinese laundry shop in Chicago. Shelley Berman, Mike Nichols and  Elaine May, Alan Alda, Robert Klein, John Belushi, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd,  Valerie Harper, Tom O'Horgan, the entire SCTV cast out of Toronto and Paul  Mazursky are only some of the nearly 300 high-profile veterans who have fanned  out through television, movies and the theater.  </P> <P> But even with that pedigree, success is hardly a sure thing. For a performing  troupe to catch the Zeitgeist in a revealing way or to penetrate the momentous  heart of a matter, the shared frequency of ensemble work is essential. Moliere  had it in his Comedie Francaise. Sid Caesar had it with "Your Show of Shows."  Andrew Alexander, who co-owns Second City (with silent partner Len Stuart), has  never had it for long and has spent innumerable hours trying to figure out how  to keep it. (His creation of the SCTV network was an anguished defensive  measure after Dan Aykroyd and Gilda Radner were spirited out of Second City by  NBC's "Saturday Night Live.")  </P> <P> All along in his Los Angeles designs, Alexander knew there was no way he could  bring a small band of his top Toronto and Chicago players to the bosom of the  entertainment industry, pay it a subsistence wage while all around were awash  in cushy development deals, and not expect at least some of the company to  bolt. So he devised a few stratagems.  </P> <P> Rather than try to insulate his company from the flurry of commercial offers  that were sure to pile in like junk mail, he enlisted as co-president of Second  City Entertainment a veteran industry executive who has worked in media  acquisitions and personal management, Michael Rollens.  </P> <P> Rollens is an insider who well knows that the principal art form in Hollywood  is the art of the deal. He brought Second City and Imagine Films together as  part owners in his management company. In addition to working their regular  schedule under Actors Equity, the company was offered holding fees by the  networks for the development efforts of its members (who were then individually  paid). They were also guaranteed producer's royalties for anything they sold.  </P> <P> That was the best Alexander could do to ensure that the center would hold. Has  it?  </P> <P> "The artistry is coming along," he said, tacitly conceding that the work has  suffered. "There was an awful lot of pressure in the beginning to open the show  and then work on TV commitments. I see a much stronger kernel in the sets now."  </P> <P> Alexander reports that the theater, which operates out of a monthly budget of  $155,000, is in the black and that a number of commercial projects are on the  verge of being finalized. They include a pilot that's been financed for  syndication; a half-hour sitcom "that's about to go on its feet" for a major  network; a prime-time sketch show that will be offered to two TV networks, and  a couple of possibilities for cable outlets. (This doesn't include in-the-works  projects by individual company members. Joe Flaherty, for example, has a  development deal with Castle Rock Productions.)  </P> <P> In February, Alexander said that development deals had been signed with CBS and  NBC, and an agreement had been struck with Imagine films for TV production and  a first look at any movie project (Imagine's financing and distribution was to  be made through Universal/MCA); all this in addition to a TV pilot deal with  Second City alumnus, writer-producer-director Steve Kampmann.  </P> <P> Right now, Alexander and Rollens are keeping silent on any details. "I wish I  could tell you," Rollens said, "but the negotiations and the business are at  such a delicate phase right now that we can't afford to say anything  prematurely. I can tell you we've accomplished a great deal in three or four  months. I just can't be specific. In three weeks from now, we expect to be able  to make some major announcements."  </P> <P> In the meantime, while all these TV deals grind invisibly along in mysterious  industry peristalsis, what about the theater?  </P> <P> "I've learned from this experience that it's important to keep people together  and not pull them from different groups," Alexander said. "The Experimental  Theater Company in (suburban) Chicago has developed a particularly strong point  of view right now. So has our Toronto group. L.A. is a very seductive town.  It's very easy to get drawn into things that aren't right for you. But an  ensemble has to be like an orchestra. You have to take time to learn how to  play together."  </P> <P> Some of the cast is happy staying put. "I got a call for an 'Adam 12' (the TV  police-series revival) and I told them I don't drive," said Chris Barnes, who  has found himself a nearly impossible-to-find, two-bedroom, rent-controlled  apartment in Santa Monica.  </P> <P> "For me, to jump to a sitcom right now is to deny why I came to Second City.  You can always jump, but for me there are more things I need to work at, like  finding the irony in an issue. Political cartoonists can do it in one panel. I  need a panorama. I don't need to do all the work and study I'm doing in order  to wind up playing a wacky neighbor in a sitcom. L.A. is not Hollywood. I have  neighbors. They get up in the morning and go to work every day. There's a  hotbed of issues here, just like anywhere else." (Barnes is at work on a sitcom  for CBS -- as a writer.)  </P> <P> "I avoid the commercial pressures," said Robin Duke (who once had a stint with  "Saturday Night Live"). "The theater is enough. One day there may be time to do  something else, but during the day you have to have a normal life you can draw  upon so that you're not just doing scenes about auditions. The struggle is to  make the work you're doing as strong as it can be."  </P> <P> "The turnover in Second City has always been high," said Dana Anderson. "It  hurts the process. You miss people, but the work is always there."  </P> <P> Said Joe Flaherty, the company's nominal artistic director (who is now on  hiatus): "You need time to develop -- a year, six months at the least. We made  a commitment to present a bunch of ideas to TV, and then, with the show, it  just became too crazy. It's easy to see why people would jump. Patching  together a development deal is a lot harder than signing up for a part on a  series. There's no money in brainstorming. It's very hard to resist the  temptation of using the revue as a showcase, to use the stage as a play to get  into the movies."  </P> <P> As for the company's uncertain artistic focus, he said: "It's the same thing we  faced in Toronto, when we had to borrow a lot of what was being done in  Chicago. In the beginning we were always coming up two or three scenes short,  and needed to do that. But it was less and less as time went on. We never liked  doing it. What you need is an ongoing company. You need to develop your own  stuff. L.A. is a city without a pulse. We're in the era of stand-up now too,  instead of the revue-oriented presentation. The greatest challenge is to keep a  group together for a year, or a couple of years. The workshops are going well.  If they can tough it out, they'll get and keep people who know what's  happening."  </P> <P> The workshops to which Flaherty referred consist of an eight-week, 20-class  schedule with 15 students working under the tutelage of such Second City alumni  as Dick Shaal, Betty Thomas, Severn Darden, Mina Kolb and Jim Fisher. Andrew  Alexander hopes to put the best of those young students into a national touring  company that would support the main companies.  </P> <P> Co-founder David Shepherd put out a manifesto in the '50s that described the  Second City's intentions: "In order for a theater to be an institution, its  audiences must love and hate it as they love and hate the church and the  President. . . . The goal of our theater should be a riot in the audience. . .  . Poetry can't appear overnight, because it's been dead in us a long time, but  a certain kind of excitement can."  </P> <P> And in February Alexander said: "This is a town where people go their own way.  If we could stay together as a family, despite occasional squabbles, we could  make things change."  </P> <P> No one in the company begrudges the fate of the people who have left, and Ryan  Stiles, Richard Kind and Diane Stilwell have stepped into the breach, as  theater pros would.  </P> <P> But no one right now expects the kind of excitement that Shepherd envisioned  when Second City was a young, green outfit with no desire or need to  accommodate a gargantuan entertainment industry whose watchful operatives seem  to be scattered in every audience. And obviously Alexander's wish for  togetherness has turned out to be a late winter hope that vanished with the  pilot season of spring.  </P> <P> Very few ideas and changes really start with movies and television. They begin  instead with the exchange among human beings, alone together without commercial  interruption. That's why the theater will always have its urgent place, and  that's why Second City hopes to keep on, though it's won no major battles so  far.  </P></p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Observer: Radiophiles? So how do European countries leave their stamp on posterity given they only have a brief six-month bash at the EU presidency? Naming some sort of scheme after a national egg-head seems a popular move. The Greeks, the current incumbents, have just christened a new educational co-operation scheme SOCRATES. It replaces something called ERASMUS, which certainly sounds as if it ought to have been dreamed up during a Dutch presidency. And presumably the LEONARDO training programme has something to do with the Italian commissioner responsible for it. Perhaps the upcoming Luxembourg presidency, though, will be a bit pushed to find a suitable title for its pet cultural initiative . . .</p>

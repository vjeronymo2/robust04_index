			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Arts: James MacMillan - London Promenade Concerts A SECOND time the Proms have played host to a James MacMillan premiere; and a second time the work has stirred its audience to roof-raising enthusiasm. Two years ago it was the orchestral work The Confessions of Isobel Gowdie, given by the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra; on Monday it was Veni, veni Emmanuel, the percussion concerto written for Evelyn Glennie and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra. But whereas the 1990 Proms triumph took the larger musical world by surprise, Monday's was predicted (and preceded by a wave of publicity). MacMillan's appeal is cheering. The young Scot (b. 1959), a devout Catholic, nationalist and socialist, does not compromise his artistic goals, does not soften his idiom or his 'committed' stance. Yet in Isobel Gowdie and now in Veni, veni Emmanuel, he seems to have found a musical voice that speaks vigorously, passionately and above all directly to a wide public. The new concerto, about 25 minutes long, is a sure, confident, expertly engineered piece of soloist-versus-orchestra showmanship, which draws its peculiar dramatic energy from the brilliance - whirlwind and will-o'-the-wisp by turns - of Glennie's virtuosity. Since the impact of the work is cunningly devised in visual as well as instrumental terms - MacMillan sends his soloist to different 'stations' of the vast percussion armoury at key sections of the musical development - it is good that BBC2 was there to record the premiere for a forthcoming relay. It is also an ambitious examination of religious faith in music, whose thematic substratum, an Advent plainsong hymn, rises, finally and with strong significance, to the musical surface. In the words of MacMillan's programme note, this process may be understood as a 'musical exploration of the theology behind the Advent message'. The same note later hints that the exploration is also deeply concerned with the ideas of liberation theology. This suggestion finds confirmation in the form and sound-evolution of the piece, a 'five-sectioned arch' in which successive phases of aggressive and then more inwardly-turned confrontation between sounds beaten and sounds blown or bowed achieve a final ringing reconciliation. (Literally: as the soloist climbs a ladder to strike key patterns on a set of tubular bells, the string players exchange their instruments for hand-bells.) Veni, veni, Emmanuel arrests attention from the first downbeat. MacMillan's harmonic signalling and underpinning are lucid. His gestures are graphic in vividness, focused in purpose, powerful yet economical in musculature. The directionality of the work - its modulation from fast to slow and back again - is achieved by means at once 'popular' (rock-inherited contrasts of blunt phrases and fiercely bright, hard-edged textures) and carefully organised (rhythmic patterns of Rite of Spring complexity). Messiaen, the 20th-century's great master of Catholic mysticism in music, seems to hover over the central, tonally ambiguous slow dialogue between musing marimba and quietly repetitive string chords. For my taste, the ending flushes out an un-Messiaen-like quality that I sense running throughout the work - a cumulative preference for gesturally achieved 'uplift' over discourse hard-worked and hard-won. Is 'facile' too forceful an epithet to describe that quality? In any case, a second hearing, at the very least, is needed to confirm or deny the suspicion - and meanwhile, the memory of Glennie's scintillating performance is ample compensation. The conductor Jukka-Pekka Saraste, should also be praised for the fighting-fit precision of the SCO ensemble. A brief, reproachful mention only of the Beethoven First Symphony that opened the concert, all brutal accents, driven phrases, avoidance of lyricism and wit; and a word of regret at the worn sound (at the top especially) of Kathleen Kuhlmann's once velvety mezzo in two Rossini arias. James MacMillan's concerto was commissioned with funds from Christian Salvesen PLC</p>

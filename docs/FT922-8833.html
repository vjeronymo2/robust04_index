			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: UK telecoms Last week's announcement that the National Grid is applying for a licence to supply telephone services will not have worried BT or Mercury unduly. Groups such as the electricity and water companies and British Rail were always likely to take advantage of their national infrastructures and special privileges. By law, they can no longer keep those privileges to themselves. But their main problem will be to find the huge sums required if they are to compete. In the year to last March, BT invested Pounds 2.4bn. In its last financial year, Mercury invested Pounds 500m. It is hard to envisage the National Grid playing in that league for years to come.</p>

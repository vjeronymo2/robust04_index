			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Carlos Martini: "Why a Coup d'Etat?"] </F>   [Text] There was a time when the hazard was real: on  Saturday, 2 January 1993 (just 3 days after the Electoral Court  of the ANR [National Republican Association--Colorado Party]  released unofficial data giving the victory to the Argana-Ybanez  ticket [for the Colorado Party presidential nomination] as  opposed to the ticket supported by General Oviedo). On other  occasions, the rumors were mere speculation.    Moreover, in the case of Paraguay, the risk of an  interruption, or even the reversal of the democratic process,  cannot be rejected. But today the possibilities for a  traditional coup are very few. This is not, however, because of  the democratic characteristics of a certain protagonist who  could head a military revolt. Oviedo has proven, with sufficient  evidence, that democratic norms and procedures are dead letters  for him. But he is aware that it is not suitable--nor does he  right now have the reasons to do so--to interrupt the process.  He has the necessary power to allow him to project himself into  the future. The fact is that he is one of the powers behind the  government. The current and inconclusive transitional scenario  permits this play of parallel powers. Referring to the current  scenario, Diego Abente Brun says: "Civilian and political  freedom will presumably be maintained and expanded, but the  contest to guarantee that the election results will not endanger  the hegemony of the military and/or the governing party will be  limited. This scenario of continuous and gradual liberalization  is what at other times has been called restrictive democracy."  ("Scenarios for the Future" in Abente Brun, Diego (compiler),  "Paraguay in Transition." Caracas, Nueva Sociedad, 1993, page  234).  <H5>  Eternal Transition </H5>   In other words, and in this respect, an inconclusive  transition and restrictive democracy are one and the same.  Abente Brun's description corresponds to the phase that we are  now experiencing. But what is even more worrying is the fact  that it is a scenario that can be projected to 1996 [municipal  elections] and 1998 [presidential elections] if certain  substantial changes do not occur in the judicial branch and the  Armed Forces. If the two branches are not purged of party  politics, especially the Electoral Court, the 1998 elections  could be a repetition, even including an improved version of its  vices, of what happened in 1993. Therefore, from the perspective  of those who are trying to outline the game plan for the current  power elite for the years after 1998, the most important thing  is not a coup d'etat (it would cause many problems with the  international community: read loans). They will try to overcome  all possible obstacles in an attempt to ensure that there are no  institutions that will effectively guarantee the free play of  democracy, but will maintain the facade and sufficient public  freedom in order to legitimize themselves in the external  spheres.    Therefore, the central theme for completing the transition  does not reside so much in the risk of a coup d'etat, at least  not under current circumstances. The axis of the debate should  be centered on the mechanisms that favor the adapting of certain  institutions and leaderships to democratic conditions. And it is  here where we have the risks, as we have said above, of bogging  down. The changes in the judicial branch do not favor the  creation of a favorable atmosphere for that democratic  institutionalization.  <H5>  The Agendas Blend </H5>   Since mid-February the social agenda, which has been  repeatedly announced in previous evaluations, has been added to  this inconclusive political transition. From that date we now  find ourselves in a time of key definitions. On the one hand it,  is a question of trying to close the political transition  agenda, and on the other, and at the same time, undertake public  social policies that will include the poorest sectors.    But neither the political nor the social agenda can be  undertaken by just one political protagonist. And much less so  can this protagonist come from the Colorado Party, which lacks  stability in its leadership and which has a minority in  Congress, in addition to the split due to the dissidence of the  Argana faction. The scenario calls for a policy of basic  consensus. But we return to the beginning; during this phase,  the basic consensus must include priority for drastic changes in  the judicial branch and modifications in certain leaderships in  the Armed Forces. If the Liberals [Authentic Liberal Radical  Party] and National Encounter accept any type of agreement  without clear demands and commitments that will be complied with  (as opposed to what President Wasmosy did with the 13 January  [1994] "democratic commitment"), then they will be betting in  favor of strengthening restrictive democracy and in the medium  term for maintenance of the invisible powers.</p>

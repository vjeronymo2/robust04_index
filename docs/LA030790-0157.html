			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BUSH VETO ON EASTERN IS UPHELD  </P> <P> The House today upheld President Bush's veto of a bill to let the government  intervene in the year-old Eastern Airlines dispute.  </P> <P> The 261-160 vote was seven votes short of the two-thirds needed to overturn the  veto.  </P> <P> At issue was Bush's quashing of a measure creating a special panel to  investigate and recommend solutions to the bitter dispute between Eastern and  8,500 mechanics and other ground service workers.  </P> <P> Override supporters said it was the last chance to save the bankrupt carrier  and jobs for the machinists who walked out last March. But members who sided  with Bush said a congressional panel would not be able to solve the dispute,  and the matter belonged in bankruptcy court.  </P></p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Leading Article: IT's not a knockout Reports that General Motors plans to sell its majority stake in Electronic Data Systems, its large computer services affiliate, suggest the world's biggest vehicle maker is not just seeking to raise badly needed cash, but may be abandoning what was once a mainstay of corporate strategy. As well as promising relief to its hard-pressed shareholders, GM's apparent rethink holds salutary lessons for managers of other businesses who are tempted to view information technology as their competitive salvation. Purchased for Dollars 2.5bn a decade ago when GM was flush with funds, EDS has proved a spectacularly profitable investment. However, it has not met GM's original goals. One was to match Japanese car manufacturers' crushing productivity advantage by using EDS's computer wizardry to revolutionise GM's antiquated production facilities. Another was to provide a path for diversifying into fast-growing IT markets. These hopes have been disappointed because the industrial logic was flawed. With hindsight, the acquisition seems to have been motivated by a desire among GM's top managers to escape from, rather than tackle head-on, a legacy of industrial decay. Dazzled by IT, a market they did not understand, they failed to see EDS for what it was. In reality, the company's factory automation experience is minimal. Its success is based on processing large volumes of data efficiently for outside clients - notably the US government  -and aggressive salesmanship. It is a business closer to the economics of the laundry than to rocket science. Magic bullet GM's recent gains in productivity and market share have been largely due to the pursuit of down-to-earth objectives. These include renewed emphasis on flexible working practices, quality, sourcing, product design and marketing. Such steps are indispensable to the company's recovery. The idea that massive investment in computers and robotics could avoid them was always suspect. Yet faith in IT as a magic bullet lives on, in governments as well as businesses. The latest convert is the Clinton administration, which is backing a range of commercial high-technology projects in the belief that they will yield above-average economic and competitive benefits. But the belief is based on shaky evidence. An exhaustive recent study of manufacturing productivity by McKinsey, the management consultants, failed to unearth any company which had succeeded mainly because of superior high-technology. Short-lived gain That is not to belittle IT's importance to business. By rendering obsolete many middle-management functions, powerful electronic information systems have provided much impetus for the recent trend towards corporate 'down-sizing'. By linking the world's main financial centres, they have vastly accelerated capital mobility. And by tearing down barriers between computing, entertainment and telecommunications, they are revolutionising the delivery of media to homes and workplaces. However, for individual companies, IT alone procures only short-lived competitive gain. That is true even in service industries, such as banking and retailing, which are its most intensive users. While IT has encouraged product innovations, notably in retail banking, these are usually easily copied by competitors. As a consequence, it has ceased to guarantee enduring advantage in financial markets and become simply a prerequisite of survival. In retailing, reliance on IT to generate market research data has helped some retailers challenge branded manufacturers' franchises. These gains, however, depended crucially on sustained investment in efficient distribution, supplier networks and just-in-time delivery systems. To view IT as a means of erecting competitive barriers is erroneous. Its real impact is to level them and make it easier for new competitors to enter markets. Though it can enable the fleet-footed to draw maximum advantage from shrewd judgment, entrepreneurship, innovation and sound organisation, it cannot substitute for these qualities. Still less can it exonerate managers from the consequences of their past neglect.</p>

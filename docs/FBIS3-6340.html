They agreed on the move,  which was proposed by Thailand, during talks held shortly after  the arrival here of Prime Minister Chuan Likphai for a four-day  official visit.    Fishery questions topped the agenda of a dozen issues the  two  delegations touched on during the plenary talks chaired by Mr  Chuan and Vietnam's Premier Vo Van Kiet. Fisheries Department  chief Plotprasop Suratsawat affirmed Thailand's eagerness to  settle the fishery row. He told the BANGKOK POST he hoped the  joint task force would be able to recommend a solution within  the first two months of its inception. "Both sides shared the  feeling that this problem must be resolved urgently but with  extreme caution as it has implications encompassing aspects of  national security, economy and the livelihoods of the two  peoples. And a rash solution could be damaging," Mr Plotprasop  said. [passage omitted]    The question of fishing rights will be discussed in depth  today in a separate meeting between Foreign Minister Prasong  Sunsiri and his Vietnamese counterpart Nguyen Manh Cam. Mr  Plotprasop will also attend the meeting. According to Mr  Plotprasop, the Thai delegation yesterday made clear to the  Vietnamese side that if there were no solution to the fishery  problem, cooperation in other fields might be affected, for  instance that of agriculture. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, Defence Minister Wichit Sukmak is due to hold  bilateral talks with Vietnam's Defence Minister Doan Khue this  morning.</p>

Prime minister Yi Hoe-chang asked those present at the  meeting to be more vigilant against the dogmatic adventurism of  North Korea.    "You should be prepared against any eventuality as the North  Korean nuclear question is about to come away from the stage of  dialogue into the phase of sanction by the UN Security Council,"  Yi said.    The prime minister also suggested that relevant offices let  the people fully know about the government's policies toward  North Korea since he said the people's understanding is  important in building up the nation's overall security  preparedness.    The officials present at the meeting included, besides the  premier, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, Defense Minister Yi  Pyong-tae, Information Minister O In-hwan, NSP Director Kim Tok  and Chief Presidential Secretary Pak Kwan-yong.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- Peruvian President Alberto  Fujimori on Tuesday solicited Japan's continued support for his  country's bid to become a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) forum.    Fujimori, who arrived in Japan on Sunday for a four-day  unofficial visit, made the call in a meeting with former Prime  Minister Toshiki Kaifu, aides to the Japanese political leader  said.    Kaifu was quoted as saying that APEC, established in  November  1989 as a loose consultative body, should be open in nature. He  offered to convey Peru's desire to concerned parties.    APEC, which currently has 17 members representing about 40  percent of the world's population, agreed last November to  freeze new membership for three years.    It links Australia, Canada, Brunei, China, Hong Kong,  Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,  Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand  and the United States. Chile will be made a full member at an  informal summit in November.    While Japan has urged fellow members to allow Peru to  participate in the forum's working group meetings, no consensus  has been reached on the matter.    Fujimori is due to leave Wednesday for China for an official  visit.</p>

			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'GLORY OF CHRISTMAS' SERVES UP JOY OF THE SEASON -- CLUMSILY  </P> <P> At its most basic level, the Crystal Cathedral's "The Glory of Christmas"  evades criticism. This elaborate but clumsy annual production is an evangelical  entertainment for the faithful -- the Greatest Story Ever Told filtered through  a Greatest Show on Earth sensibility.  </P> <P> The latest offering, featuring a trove of special effects and the usual  menagerie of barnyard animals, will satisfy those who come to feel both the joy  of the season and the strength of religious conviction. Director Paul David  Dunn gives a clear, linear telling of Joseph and Mary's being touched by God  and that fateful night in the Bethlehem manger.  </P> <P> But anyone who looks closely may be distracted by the show's uneasy staging.  Patches are resoundingly rough, from the aimless look of crowd scenes as actors  search for their marks to the awkward approach in setting up the big solos, and  the general tone is so thick that only children are likely to be unequivocally  enchanted.  </P> <P> Then again, this is an event for kids as much as anyone, and you can almost  forgive Dunn for making everything so sensational and preachy. Followers of the  Crystal Cathedral certainly will be forgiving, even when the obvious is pushed  into blatancy, which is often.  </P> <P> To signal the Immaculate Conception, Mary (played in alternating performances  by Jonel Dayen Christensen, Debby Smith and Donal Carol White) all but rubs her  tummy. And when we learn of Herod's anger over Jesus' birth, it's to the  insidious laughter of Arthur C. (Buddy) Adler as Herod.  </P> <P> He makes his exit, that maniacal cackle trailing behind, as narrator Thurl  Ravenscroft reminds us that Herod was a very bad man. Ravenscroft's  rhapsodizing voice can get pretty heavy at times, even in a church not known  for its subtlety.  </P> <P> As spectacle, "Glory" only disappoints in its lack of simplicity and grace. But  how agile can you be when asked to lead camels, sheep, cows and baa-ing lambs  to center stage? Children will gape at all the animal husbandry and bold  costumes, and their parents may be transfixed every now and then as well.  </P> <P> Of course, don't expect much modesty; this isn't a high school pageant blessed  by homespun restraint. The angels (rigged up by Peter Foy's "Flying by Foy"  company) zoom in from smoke clouds, delivering benedictions over the audience,  and heavenly spotlights (effects by Rick Helgason) bounce around the pews.  </P> <P> As usual, the Crystal Cathedral finds entertainment salvation in the boffo  gesture, and, as usual, it is ironic that such extravagance is seen as the best  way to tell this familiar and beautiful story.  </P> <P> There is piousness, though, in the handling of most of the songs, a lovely  compilation of Christmas' best that serves as "Glory's" centerpiece. Musical  director Johnnie Carl has, unfortunately, prerecorded the music; but the  singing is live, with an accomplished cast providing pleasing renditions of  these classics. Among the best are "O Holy Night," "What Child is This?" and  "The First Noel."  </P> <P> 'THE GLORY OF CHRISTMAS'  </P> <P> A Crystal Cathedral production. Directed and written by Paul David Dunn.

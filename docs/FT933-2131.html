			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Tax treaty may spark corporate shake-up THE US and the Netherlands have approved a draft tax treaty which could prompt restructuring of a number of multinational companies. The assistant secretary for tax policy at the US Treasury and the director-general for fiscal affairs in the Netherlands have agreed amendments to the US-Dutch tax treaty initialled last December, which clear the way for ratification, possibly by the end of the year. Even if the one-year grace period permitted by the treaty is invoked, the agreement means that from January 1 1995 US subsidiaries held through companies in the Netherlands will no longer be eligible to take advantage of low tax rates between the two countries. 'A large number of companies may be restructuring, beginning December 31 this year,' Mr Bruce Lassman, head of the US tax desk at accountants Ernst &amp; Young, said yesterday. The revised treaty, negotiated over more than 11 years, imposes tough new criteria for eligibility. Those companies excluded will see US withholding taxes on dividends to Dutch companies rise from 5 per cent to 30 per cent and on interest payments from zero to 30 per cent. One of the principal reasons for the delay was a clause concerning tax treatment of Swiss branches of Dutch companies, which had not been finalised. Negotiators have now agreed a text, which states the US will impose a 15 per cent withholding tax unless income from Swiss branches is taxed at more than 17.5 per cent.</p>

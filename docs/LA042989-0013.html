			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP BEAT: STONE-FACED ROCK FROM DOGS D'AMOUR  </P> <P> Those lashing, slashing guitars . . . those tattered, shattered vocals . . .  those boozy, bluesy tunes. . . . No, it wasn't the Rolling Stones, or even the  Rod Stewart-era Faces, but yet another English import: the Dogs D'Amour.  </P> <P> Performing before a near-capacity crowd Thursday at the Whisky, the quartet  displayed a staggering, swaggering sense of swashbuckling style, a two-fisted  command of stage 'n' sound and the uncommon good sense to keep all their songs  short. This last element was especially welcome, 'cause there wasn't much  variation, virtuosity or subtle nuance in the group's knock 'em back, rock 'em  back attack.  </P> <P> Still, if these good-bad, but not evil characters ever come up with one song  the equal of their influences, they'll be bashin' out the trash and countin'  the cash for as long as their collective livers hold up. DON WALLER  </P></p>

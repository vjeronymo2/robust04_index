			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Widney to buy SPC for Pounds 4m WIDNEY, a maker of windows and water treatment, power transmission and electronic equipment, has entered into a conditional agreement to acquire SPC International for a maximum Pounds 4m. The company's shares were suspended at 7p last month pending the announcement of an acquisition. Dealings were restored yesterday and the shares closed at 8p. The principal activity of SPC, which was formed in 1989, is the purchase, refurbishment and resale of electronic point of sale systems, cash dispensing equipment and financial terminals for use in banks and shops worldwide. The initial consideration of Pounds 3.2m will be satisfied via the allotment of 42.67m new shares, of which 23.47m are being placed on behalf of the vendors at 7 1/2 p to raise some Pounds 1.76m. Deferred consideration of up to Pounds 800,000 is dependent on profits. Widney intends to raise a further Pounds 2.73m by the issue of an additional 36.41m new shares at 7 1/2 p to improve working capital and to cover the costs of the purchase. Accordingly, a total of 79.08m new shares will be issued of which 19.2m, representing 14 per cent of the enlarged capital, will be retained by the vendors. The vendors of SPC have undertaken that profits before tax for the year ended June will be not less than Pounds 600,000 (Pounds 487,000) and that net assets at completion will be not less than Pounds 1.25m.</p>

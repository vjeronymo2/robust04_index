			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Nov 15 KYODO -- Japan will outline a clear  policy for conserving its forests through sustainable management  at a board meeting of the International Timber Organization  (ITTO) in Yokohama Tuesday [16 November], Forestry Agency  sources said Monday.    Yoshio Hironaka, head of the agency's guidance division,  will  articulate Japan's wish to tackle forest depletion at home as  well as abroad, the sources said.    Hironaka will explain that sustainable timber management  continues to be a prime conservation goal of the government,  they said.    Such management involves protecting existing forests and  replanting felled areas while still making economic progress.    The ITTO member countries agreed at a meeting in June last  year to promote sustainable forest management worldwide and not  just in tropical regions.    European countries, the United States and Canada have  already  pledged to act on the agreement, the sources said.    The agency hopes that Japan's commitment will facilitate  stalled talks between advanced and developing countries over  revising the international tropical timber agreement which  expires next March, they said.    The ITTO meeting in Yokohama started November 10 and  continues until Wednesday with government and nongovernment  representatives from countries producing or consuming tropical  timber.</p>

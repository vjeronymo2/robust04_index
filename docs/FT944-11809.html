			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / OFT to judge bids for VSEL GEC's bid to take over the submarine maker VSEL should be judged by UK competition authorities rather than the European Commission, the Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday. A similar decision has already been made in the case of BAe's bid for VSEL. Both are being assessed in the UK because in some situations the government can exclude big deals from EU jurisdiction if special national interests are involved. The bids will now be examined by the Office of Fair Trading, which normally expects to produce its recommendation within three weeks.</p>

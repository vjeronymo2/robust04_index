			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The board of directors of the European Drugs  Monitoring Center met for the first time this morning at the  Belem Cultural Center. Mario Rui reports.    Rui: The organization has a budget of more than  900 billion escudos to diagnose, and at least try to control,  drug trafficking. This is the organization's main objective.  Much more than monitoring, the center will give the [European]  Community and its member states objective and reliable  information which can be studied at a European level so the  Community can take the necessary measures to reduce drug use,  production, and trafficking. The organization was set up by the  Twelve and will be based in Lisbon. [begin recording]    Portuguese Deputy Minister Marques Mendes: This is  above all a political question. Faced with a tragedy of this  kind, faced with the dimension of this phenomena in Europe and  in the whole world, faced with the major efforts by the various  societies, and in view of the small results achieved so far, I  believe it is not possible for people to turn their backs on  each other when it comes to this issue. [end recording]    [Passage omitted]</p>

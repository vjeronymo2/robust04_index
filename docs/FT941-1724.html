			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / HSE pressed on manslaughter A campaign has been launched to persuade the Health and Safety Executive to give a higher priority to possible manslaughter prosecutions in cases where workers are killed in the workplace. In a report today, a health and safety pressure group highlights 28 workplace deaths in which it claims that insufficient investigation was carried out by inspectors. The report, by the West Midlands Health and Safety Advice Centre, an advisory organisation funded by local authorities, criticises the HSE for failing to bring more prosecutions. The HSE said last night that prosecutions for manslaughter in this area rarely succeeded and decisions to proceed were a matter for the Crown Prosecution Service.</p>

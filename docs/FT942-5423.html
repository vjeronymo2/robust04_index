			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: An ebbing tide If this were a normal cycle, the UK equity market should soon start to disengage from bonds. Equities would out-perform because economic recovery would feed through to corporate earnings while the gilt market started to worry about inflation and monetary tightening. Two developments this week suggest the pattern may not automatically repeat itself this time. One is the April setback in the housing market. The other is yesterday's M4 money supply data which shows that, after net purchases of gilts as high as Pounds 2.7bn in December, overseas investors were net sellers to the tune of Pounds 1.3bn in April. It is too early to say whether the April housing figures simply represent a blip in a still rising trend. But they do cast some doubt on the inflation fears which have been commonly cited as a reason for the weakness of gilts this week. Taken together with the data on overseas purchases and the run-up in real yields on index-linked stock, that suggests the real problem may still be the withdrawal of the overseas liquidity which sustained the market at its peak. Whatever the balance between the two factors, the outlook for gilts is not particularly encouraging. If growth and inflation worries are not the cause of the market's malaise, the liquidity shortage leaves little reason for expecting a sustained recovery. Equities by contrast could do with a dose of growth, but they too seem to have suffered from the shortage of international investment liquidity: witness the FT-SE 100's 15 per cent slide since February despite the improving economic outlook. If liquidity shortage remains the dominant influence, even the prospect of growth at 3 per cent this year would not put much life back into equities.</p>

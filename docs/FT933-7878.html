			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Explosion unearths chipmakers' fears - New concerns over price increases FEW in the world semiconductor industry had heard of the chemical plant in Niihama, a coastal city in western Japan, until it blew up last month. As the dust settled it emerged that the site produced 60 per cent of world requirements for a type of epoxy resin used to seal chips. Sumitomo Chemical, owner of the plant, said yesterday that half its capacity should be restored by the end of the year. This partially allayed anxieties in the industry of a severe shortfall in supply of the material at a time when semiconductor demand, particularly in the US, is strong. But it has not been able to quell concerns that Sumitomo's dominance of the epoxy resin market leaves chipmakers vulnerable - not so much to another explosion, but to price increases. Sumitomo had been trying to raise prices of epoxy resins since April, and the company yesterday said it would continue to press for an increase. There were two main reasons why the semiconductor industry was in the dark about Sumitomo's importance as a supplier. First, epoxy resin producers sell their product not directly to the industry but to compound makers who provide the finished substance. Second, the number of suppliers has shrunk relatively recently, with makers such as Dow Chemical of the US leaving the market. Chipmakers argue Sumitomo had gained its position in the past few years through aggressive pricing. The strategy, to buy market share and then boost its prices, may have been in its final stage when the blast occurred. The chemical makers in turn blame the semiconductor industry for the razor-thin margins which the materials carry, saying that it has held down suppliers' prices to control costs during its cyclical downturn. Sumitomo itself says that its epoxy resin operations, with Y6bn (Pounds 37.8m) annual sales, were in the red. However, NEC, another leading Japanese electronics group, insists that Sumitomo's marketing policy was partly responsible for the low profitability of the epoxy resin business. 'They came into the market with very cheap prices to increase market share,' said one official. An official at a US chemical company agreed that Sumitomo, which entered the market in the early 1980s, had destroyed the pricing structure for epoxy resin. Japan's Fair Trade Commission bans unfair price reductions which erode profits and drive competitors out of the market. But the FTC insists that it found no problem with Sumitomo's case. Semiconductor makers have started to look at ways to reduce the use of epoxy. NEC says it is experimenting with other substances such as the ceramics which some producers use, while Toshiba is trying to cut down the size of the semiconductor itself. The case has also flushed out the exposure of the semiconductor industry to one or two suppliers controlling other crucial substances. Tanaka Kikinzoku, a specialist metals company, produces an estimated 70 per cent of the wire bonding for semiconductors while Tokyo Ohka Kogyo has a 30 per cent market share for photoresists, another component. Sumitomo has meanwhile acted to restore 50 to 60 per cent of its usual epoxy resin output from next month through arrangements with Nippon Kayaku and Dainippon Ink and Chemicals, the country's other two significant producers of epoxy, as well as with Chang Chun Plastics of Taiwan. They are boosting output through the use of spare capacity, technological assistance from Sumitomo, and adding production lines. These moves have themselves given rise to fears that relationships among the suppliers are becoming more cosy. By next year Sumitomo should have regained its market leadership and may be in a position to dictate a mutually beneficial new pricing policy. The market for the type of epoxy resin used in semiconductors is difficult to enter for other reasons. Purity requirements are high, and the first three months' output from any new facility is on trial and can be rejected by users on quality grounds. Dow, which moth-balled its Texas plant in 1991, would be subject to the same vetting if it reopened. It was unwilling to do this unless Sumitomo guaranteed a market for the first five years of its output. The two are said to have discussed the possibility but such a commitment appeared too long-term for Sumitomo to find palatable. The Japanese company said yesterday that it intended to have annual production capacity of 5,500 tonnes by the end of the year by restarting one of two lines at a cost of more than Y1.4bn.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the Senate debate on the Senate bill, Senator Lieberman explained these developments. He explained that President Bush's bill <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  would have left the final decision about imposing additional controls to EPA. But Senator Lieberman explained that this was ``unacceptable'' because EPA's lack of support for past regional efforts to adopt controls was in part responsible for their failure. Senator Lieberman went on to explain that concerns were raised to the committee that the commission was being given ``too much authority'' because it would have ``ultimate authority to impose additional controls on sources of emissions in the separate States.'' Lieberman emphasized the importance of taking from EPA the responsibility for recommending baseline regional controls. He went on to explain that, under the bill. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Final authority to disapprove additional measures actually rests with EPA. However, EPA bears the burden, as clearly stated in the bill, of demonstrating that the additional control measure is not necessary to bring any area of the region into attainment by the dates provided. In making their decision, EPA must not place unfair burdens on the recipient State. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> President Bush's bill was H.R. 3030, as introduced. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> See Senate Debate on S. 1630 (Jan. 31, 1990), reprinted in 4 1990 Legislative History at 5077 (statement of Sen. Lieberman). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted, the conference adopted the House version. The debates on the conference bill focused primarily on the importance of the transport provisions to address a significant problem. In the Senate Debate on the conference bill, <!-- PJG 0172 columnbreak -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Senator Lieberman again explained EPA's responsibilities in responding to an OTC recommendation: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Administrator has the final authority to disapprove additional measures recommended by the Commission. However, EPA bears a heavy burden of demonstrating that the additional control measure(s) is not necessary to bring any area of the region into attainment by the dates provided and to recommend equal or more effective actions that could be taken by the Commission to conform the disapproved portion of the recommendations. Any recommendations by EPA under this section designed to replace the recommendations of the Commission shall not place an unfair burden on any state which is the victim of the transported air pollution. Equal or more effective actions recommended by the EPA shall mean actions which achieve equivalent progress towards attainment of the standard, given full consideration of the impact of transported air pollution. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Senate Debate (Oct. 27, 1990), 1 1990 Legislative History at 1053 (Statement of Senator Lieberman). Also in the Senate Debate on the Conference bill, Senator Baucus inserted a detailed explanation of the bill, known as the Baucus-Chafee Statement of Senate Managers. See 1 1990 Legislative History at 1000 and 1045. The Statement of Senate Managers reiterated Senator Lieberman's points, using his exact language quoted above to describe EPA's role in responding to an OTC recommendation, including the emphasis on EPA's ``heavy burden'' to disapprove. 1 1990 Legislative History at 1004. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Applicability of Rulemaking Procedure <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 184(c) establishes a specific notice-and-comment procedure both for OTC development of and EPA action to approve or disapprove recommendations for additional control measures in the OTR. These procedures are compatible with, but not necessarily identical to, the procedures the Agency must follow to issue a rule. The statute is silent as to whether EPA can take final action on the OTC recommendation without complying with notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures. EPA does not believe that rulemaking procedures are necessary if EPA disapproves the OTC recommendation because such an action would not have a binding future effect on any regulated parties. It is less clear whether rulemaking procedures are necessary for approval or partial approval of the OTC recommendation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

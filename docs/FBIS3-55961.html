			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Yuriy Stroganov report under the "Nearby Foreign Countries" </F> rubric: "Lithuania Knocks on NATO's Door"]    [Text] Vilnius -- The stance adopted by Lithuanian  officials on the issue of joining NATO has, as we know, been  defined. President Algirdas Brazauskas announced that he has  sent a letter to NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner which,  referring to the 23 December 1993 resolution by the Lithuanian  Seimas, officially requests that the Lithuanian Republic be  admitted in NATO.    Obviously this decision has crystallized under pressure from  opponents of the ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party and by  Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the right-wing forces. Day  after day he has harshly criticized the country's authorities  for the vagueness of their stance in respect of joining NATO.    But they reacted to this with caution. Talk centered more on  the need to agree positions with Latvia and Estonia, where  Russian troops are still present, and on a well-balanced  political process. Lithuanian Seimas Chairman Ceslovas Jursenas  declared recently that the issue of the country's membership any  political or military organization should be decided by the  people via a referendum, and not by the president or the Seimas.    Obviously, the results of the elections to the Russian State  Duma have forced amendments.    It was on the back of an anti-Kremlin feeling that V.  Landsbergis once managed to gain significant political advantage  in Lithuania. Now, against a background of the strengthening of  those very same feelings, right-wing political parties and  movements are again gaining strength. At the third congress of  the "Union of the Fatherland" party, led by V. Landsbergis, it  was stated outright that the main threat comes from Russia and  the ruling party is prepared...to fall into its embrace  economically at first, and then politically.    Actually, on many political issues the authorities and the  opposition in Lithuania follow one and the same lead. If  nothing else, proof of this is offered by the letter from the  republic's Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys, sent, evidently in  support of the statement by A. Brazauskas, to U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher.    P. Gylys expresses the thought that NATO is a guarantor of  Lithuania's security. The minister's concern is roused in  particular, in his words, by the large concentration of Russia's  Army in Kaliningrad Oblast. Lithuania would like to draw the  international community's attention to the need to demilitarize  this region. P. Gylys is also concerned that, in the wake of  Russia's parliamentary elections, its foreign policy may become  "more nationalistic and aggressive toward the Baltic states...."    Certain forces in Lithuania do not conceal their  geopolitical  sympathies. A curious episode occurred not so long ago during a  meeting in the small city of Skaudvile between its inhabitants  and officials from the "Union of the Fatherland" and "Sajudis."  It voiced in particular the idea of the threat to Lithuania's  interests if its officers are trained in Ryazan. A proposal  emerged: Surely it is better to send them to NATO countries or  directly to the Pentagon. But then somebody asked: And what  will happen if they are recruited by the CIA? "So be it,"  exclaimed the leader of the Skaudvile branch of "Sajudis."    Incidentally, on the subject of the CIA, the Lithuanian  press  has revealed a sensational discovery that a CIA residence  operates semi-legally in Vilnius, and a specific address has  even been named.    Emotion aside, Lithuania's political will has been  expressed.  Admittedly, it is doubtful whether NATO will give a positive  response straight off, without considering the interests of  Russia itself.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A spokesman for the United Somali Congress-Somali  Salvation Alliance [USC-SSA] announced today that the fighting  provoked by the Somali National Alliance [SNA] in violation of  peace agreements, is still going on in Mogadishu and that the  SNA has continued to strengthen its attacks especially in Makka  and Madina districts in Mogadishu.    He said that USC-SSA forces are courageously facing the  SNA's  antipeace provocations. The spokesman said: We have in  principle endeavored and are ready to halt the fighting in which  Somali blood is being shed but the SNA leader, Aidid, is  adamant. It is therefore right for us to defend our lives,  property, principles, and generally the security and unity of  the Somali people, the spokesman added, particularly since the  SNA forces are planning new attacks in the rest of Mogadishu in  the near future. The spokesman termed as far-fetched and untrue  reports released by the BBC and those carrying white flags while  actually serving Aidid to the effect that peace has been reached  and that the fighting has ended. In conclusion, the spokesman  explained that the fighting in Mogadishu is not based on clans  but is being fought between the USC-SSA and small SNA groups.  He pointed out that nobody will gain from resorting to clan  loyalties.</p>

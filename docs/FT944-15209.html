			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Corning jumps 24% to Dollars 132m Corning, the diversified US manufacturer, pushed up net earnings by 24 per cent in the third quarter, on a comparable basis, to Dollars 132.3m, or 62 cents a share, writes Our New York Staff. Earnings were hit, however, by a net Dollars 55.4m charge related to the cost of three acquisitions in life sciences. Sales in the quarter were up 20 per cent to Dollars 1.4bn, half the rise being due to the acquisitions. Net income from associates rose 35 per cent to Dollars 42.4m, mainly because of loss elimination after the sale last year of Vitro Corning, a Mexican venture.</p>

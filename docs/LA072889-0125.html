			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS;  </P> <P> GM PROFIT SLUMPS 3.9% IN QUARTER; FORD'S FALLS 15.6%  </P> <P> General Motors Corp. said its second-quarter net income dropped 3.9%, and Ford  Motor Co. posted a 15.6% quarterly profit decline Thursday, evidence of a  softening U.S. vehicle market and the costs of buyer incentives.  </P> <P> Both companies said the results reflected a weakening car and truck market and  the cost of incentives they used in efforts to boost sales, a trend industry  analysts had expected.  </P> <P> </P> <P> General Motors Corp.  </P> <P> GM earned $1.45 billion during the three months ended June 30, compared to  $1.51 billion during the same time last year.  </P> <P> GM revenue, which includes sales by the GM Hughes Electronics Corp., Electronic  Data Systems Corp. and General Motors Acceptance Corp. subsidiaries that  reported earnings Wednesday, rose 1.3% during the quarter to $33.6 billion from  $33.18 billion last year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ford Motor Co.  </P> <P> Ford, the nation's second-largest auto maker, reported that it made $1.4  billion during the quarter this year, compared to $1.66 billion a year ago.  </P> <P> Ford revenue rose to $25.9 billion from $24.96 billion.  </P> <P> Earnings from Ford's financial services group fell 19.9% to $173 million, due  to lower net interest margins, the company said.  </P> <P> Chrysler Corp., the nation's third-largest auto maker, is to report its  second-quarter earnings on Monday.  </P> <P> Ford's U.S. profits softened due to expensive incentive programs and reduced  profit margins, said David M. McCammon, Ford treasurer and vice president for  finance.  </P> <P> Incentives pose a double threat for auto makers' profits. When sales slump,  profits generally do too. To boost sales and profits, companies gamble a bit by  offering incentives that are costly in the short-term but designed to produce  increased consumer interest and more buyers in the long-term.  </P> <P> But when interest wanes, as recent sales declines apparently indicate, returns  on incentive costs may come later, if at all, and that cuts into short-term  profits.  </P> <P> GM's domestic car and truck sales through the first half of this year were 7.7%  behind last year's pace and Ford's were down by 3.6%.  </P> <P> McCammon said incentives during the second quarter cost Ford between $600 and  $700 a vehicle, up sharply from the $200 to $300 average cost during the first  quarter of this year and the second quarter of last year.  </P> <P> GM spokesman Terry Sullivan said per-car incentive costs for the quarter were  unavailable. However, GM spent about $715 per car last year on incentives and  said costs for the programs would be higher this year, he said.  </P> <P> The nation's two largest auto makers also said their overseas operations  continued to do well, making up for profit shortfalls in their North American  operations.  </P> <P> "GM's North American automotive operations continue to improve their operating  efficiencies, while overseas earnings in 1989 are exceeding the record levels  achieved in 1988," said a joint statement by GM Chairman Roger B. Smith and  President Robert C. Stempel.  </P> <P> "They both had good first halves of the year in Europe," said analyst Joshua  Harari, of Standard &amp; Poors Corp. in New York. "This plays an important  part in supporting their earnings -- it has for the last two years."  </P> <P> For the first six months of the year, GM earned $3.01 billion, up 15.7% from  $2.6 billion during the first six months of last year. Revenue during the  January-June period this year rose to $59.63 billion from $56.34 billion.  </P> <P> Ford's earnings for the first half of 1989 fell 7.6% to $3.04 billion from  $3.29 billion a year earlier. Revenue rose to $51.76 billion from $48.15  billion.  </P> <P> GM and Ford said they were continuing cost-cutting programs to improve their  profitability in the face of a softer economy and forecasts of lower vehicle  sales next year.  </P></p>

			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / How not to give a moral lead: Pope John Paul II's draft encyclical allows no role for the individual conscience Since it still claims a universal mission, there is no presumption in a non-Catholic writing about the affairs of the Roman Catholic Church. Indeed, for a lay Anglican, I have got to know recent Popes unusually well. Not that I have ever met one. But it was once my lot to read the tomes of papal encyclicals issued over the past century, and they cast a cruel light on Rome's renewed crusade against birth control and internal dissent. The toil was not, alas, a course of instruction on the meaning and sanctity of life. It was an attempt to get to grips with the mercurial concept of subsidiarity, an idea made flesh in successive encyclicals since Leo XIII's Rerum Novarum (1891), including Paul VI's controversial Humanae Vitae (1968). Subsidiarity, remember, was a cornerstone of the Maastricht treaty. As the rest of the temple crashes to the ground, it still stands as Jacques Delors's Vatican-inspired solution to the challenge of building a European state without des-troying its peoples' way of life. The ideas behind subsidiarity are simple. Leave unto God what is God's, and within Caesar's realm, pass power down as far as possible, preferably to local communities and families, the building blocks of society. The problem, of course, is to decide what rightly belongs to the Almighty and what to Caesar; and then to find a formula for determining who should decide those matters that are left to the state. The nearest the Vatican has come to tackling that is Quadragesimo Anno, Pius XI's riposte to Mussolini's ambitions to nationalise church activity. Governments, warned Pius, would 'carry out with greater freedom, power and success the tasks belonging to them alone' if they left matters of lesser importance 'to smaller groups'. Those in charge should know when to desist, and ought to be solicitous of the views and circumstances of 'lower societies'. Now, as anyone who has ever watched or participated in the political game ought to know, this is pie in the sky. Without formal checks and balances, achieved through blood or sweat (and usually both), virtually no society in history has for any long period secured rulers obedient to such precepts. Which brings us straight to Veritatis Splendor, the draft encyclical awaiting the present Pope's signature. For the most striking thing about the modern papacy - forget Galileo - is its contempt for its own precepts. Consider Rome's attitude to the 'lower societies' in its own communion. Back at the first Vatican Council of 1870, when the principle of papal infallibility was codified, the Church as a whole was pronounced infallible, and the Pope was enjoined to consult the brethren before exerting authority. What process of consultation has there ever been on the question of birth control? Before Humanae Vitae a papal commission was established to investigate and solicit views on the issue. A majority of the commission apparently recommended a relaxation of Catholic teaching on the issue, but Paul VI insisted on a blanket ban on 'any action which either before, or at the moment of, or after sexual intercourse, is specifically intended to prevent procreation'. This time round, there has not even been a commission. There have been 'consultations' with bishops' conferences and interested parties - but if the published drafts of Veritatis Splendor are remotely accurate, the Church in western Europe and North America was given the deaf ear. Anyway, why does John Paul II feel it necessary to dictate to the 'lower societies' on the issue at all? If subsidiarity means anything within the Church, then surely on matters not critical to faith the Pope should refrain from imposing his will and allow the Church on the ground to apply its own Christian conscience to the moral and social problems besetting its members. John Paul's response, according to the published draft, is highly convoluted, but it seems to run like this. The Church's moral teachings 'while they are to be distinguished from the assent to faith, nevertheless enlarge it'. The 'natural law' from which they are drawn is 'universally valid' and only the Pope is capable of expounding its 'binding nature'. And once expounded, the faithful have no choice but to obey since obedience to the natural law is 'necessary for salvation' and 'dissent stands in opposition to the unity of the Church'. In other words, there is no role for individuals and 'lower societies' to apply their conscience to any moral question once the Pope has expounded the natural law - law which, by its nature, is not written down definitively anywhere save in past papal pronouncements, themselves reflecting the conscience of Christians in previous generations applied to their circumstances. So much for subsidiarity. The net effect in the west, of course, will be further to undermine Catholic teaching, and to leave in a moral quagmire Catholics who believe there is any role for individual conscience. The tragedy is the damage John Paul II will do to the very notion of moral and spiritual leadership. For at last, the liberal conceit that we always know what is best for us is biting the dust. But as a community in search of a credible moral lead, where do we look? Certainly not to a papacy which rejects outright Newman's profound wisdom that 'conscience is the first of all the vicars of Christ'.</p>

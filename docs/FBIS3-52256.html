In a statement to ANATOLIA agency in London, the Islamic  Movement of Kurdistan declared that its forces seized the  townships of Balkhah and Ahmad Awah, which occupy a strategic  point from a transportation standpoint. The statement denied  reports that 'Uthman 'Abd-al-'Aziz, leader of the Islamic  Movement of Kurdistan, was captured last week by the Patriotic  Union of Kurdistan led by Talabani. The statement noted that  'Abd-al-'Aziz is currently conducting talks in Salah-al-Din to  stop the clashes with Mas'ud Barzani.    The statement further claimed that in the recent clashes,  Talabani's forces were helped by Iranian communist Kurdish  organizations and former PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]  militants. Charging that the recent elections held in northern  Iraq were rigged, the statement said that Barzani and Talabani  failed to keep their promises to renew the elections and  everyone should learn that Talabani's words cannot be trusted.</p>

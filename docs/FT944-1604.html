			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of Sweden (10): EU vote was critical - The forestry industry No other Swedish industry had more at stake in the country's European Union referendum than the forestry sector. Even people not directly involved in the industry - the country's biggest net export earner - agreed that Sweden's pulp and paper companies had much to lose if the country had stayed outside. 'For the forestry industry a 'No' would have a catastrophe,' says Mr Arne Martensson, chief executive of Svenska Handelsbanken. The EU is the Swedish forest industry's biggest market by far. About 30 per cent of its existing capacity is located outside Sweden within EU borders. But the EU is also an important market for many of the country's other multinationals, so it is not simply a question of access. What distinguishes the forestry sector is the continuing environmental debate, covering everything from recycling and waste management to clear-cutting (the practice of completely clearing whole swathes of forest land at one go) and eco-labelling. The Swedes felt they simply had to have a direct say in shaping policy in issues of such commercial importance to their companies. The nightmare scenario for Sweden's pulp and paper sector would be an EU forestry policy that coupled maximum stress on recycling with maximum emphasis on the preservation of existing forest areas. At its most extreme, that could mean Sweden having to import recycled fibre from the continent to meet EU rules on paper content. Or it could mean Swedish companies being banned from clear-cutting. Rules such as these, were they ever to be enforced, could raise costs in a country with enough natural handicaps already in the form of slow tree growth and long distances to markets. It could also hinder the access of Swedish companies to their main markets. Swedish forestry executives say they have nothing against recycling, but they want a balanced view of its relationship with virgin fibre. 'Virgin fibre and recycled waste paper are two important components in the same system,' says Dr Jan Remrod, director-general of the Swedish pulp and paper association. He also advocates a broader view of waste management, giving greater emphasis to energy recovery than has been the case until now. 'There are limits to the amount of times paper can be recycled and sometimes the distances involved do not make it worthwhile. It would be a better idea to take out the energy instead, producing heat and electricity which saves coal and oil,' he says. Pleased as they are by the outcome of the EU vote, it is already clear that membership will carry a cost for the forestry groups. Mr Goran Persson, Sweden's finance minister, has announced a series of new corporate, energy and environment taxes to help fund the estimated SKr20bn annual cost of Swedish EU membership. Stora, Europe's biggest pulp and paper group, believes the measures will add as much as SKr230m to its annual costs, including the impact of higher social security charges. But there is surprisingly little grumbling. That has probably got a lot to do with the fact that Sweden's pulp and paper groups have enjoyed a much better 1994 than they expected now that a strong cyclical recovery in the sector is under way. Profits have grown as rising prices and strong demand have driven up capacity utilisation and sales. The weak krona, cost-cutting and lower debt burdens have also contributed to the upturn. Prices are increasing for virtually all grades of paper and paperboard - although the impact has yet to be fully felt in companies' profit-and-loss accounts. Long fibre pulp prices have doubled in little more than a year and are set to reach Dollars 750 per tonne by January 1. Prices for fine paper, which has a high pulp content, have also climbed sharply, as have prices for sawn timber. In other segments, such as publication papers, the impact has been modest although big price rises are on the way. A picture of an industry making a rapid return to health, after three difficult years between 1991 and 1993, emerged at the nine-month stage. Stora announced a profit of SKr2.04bn, seven times higher than the SKr294m profit achieved in the same 1993 period. MoDo swung to a profit of SKr1.01bn from a SKr427m loss while SCA lifted profits to SKr1.59bn from SKr788m. The industry expects even better figures next year because of higher prices. With balance sheets also in much better shape, companies are starting to expand again, either by acquisition or by building new capacity. MoDo has announced SKr3bn of new investments, including a SKr2.1bn outlay on a new newsprint machine at its Braviken plant in Sweden. Stora is considering a SKr2.8bn investment in a new board machine. AssiDoman has agreed to buy MoDo Packaging in a deal worth SKr1.2bn. Industry estimates suggest Swedish companies will invest as much as SKr8bn in 1995, about the same amount as they invested annually in the late 1980s at the last cyclical peak. This makes investors nervous because the downturn that struck the industry in 1991 was caused more by overcapacity than weak demand. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Swedish forestry groups invested heavily in the UK, Germany and France because they wanted to establish themselves close to their main markets. In the present expansion phase, there are signs that a greater proportion of investments will be concentrated at home. This trend undoubtedly reflects the productivity gains achieved in the Swedish forest industry over the past few years. Dr Remrod says the new competitiveness and the need to exploit virgin fibre resources make it natural for the expansion to be in Sweden. 'There is a need for more fresh fibre in the system and the waste paper trend is balancing out,' he says.</p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of The Earth Summit (12): Man with a global mission - Profile of Maurice Strong WHATEVER the outcome of the Earth Summit, the fact that it is taking place at all is due largely to a short, bustling Canadian with a cheerful face: Maurice Strong. For the last two years, Maurice Strong, secretary general of the UN Conference on the Environment and Development (Unced), has roamed the world from his office in a faded mansion on the outskirts of Geneva, drumming up support for the event. As preparations reached their climax earlier this year, he was visiting a different continent almost every day. Not bad going for someone who recently celebrated his 63rd birthday, writes David Lascelles. But Mr Strong has brought a dash of passion to his job - in addition to the patience and good humour which he has needed to keep things moving, particularly during the last few months when it looked as if Rio was getting hopelessly bogged down. 'The environment is not a matter of dealing with a few pollution problems,' he says. 'We've gone far beyond that. It exposes the underlying technological malaise of our civilisation. We have not done it deliberately, but we have lost our innocence.' For much of his life, Mr Strong was a businessman, holding senior positions in Petro-Canada and Power Corp. of Canada. In the 1970s he became involved in the UN's growing environmental efforts. Although he returned briefly to the private sector after that, he was again drawn into the UN during the 1980s, eventually acquiring the job of organising Rio. If he imagined that mounting concern about the state of the planet would make his job easy, this has turned out to be far from the case. As the preparations exposed ever deeper divisions between the rich and poor, the greens and industry, governments and lobbyists, Strong was increasingly cast as a mediator, hunting for points of agreement, soothing, encouraging, prodding. . . He had to contend with a rising barrage of scepticism in the media - which he dealt with by granting hundreds of interviews in which the message usually boiled down to: 'Yes, there are problems, but we're getting there.' He has his critics too, particularly in the industrial world where he is viewed as siding too closely with the interests of poor countries, and over-simplifying the issues - 'Maurice tends to behave as if the environmental debate is still the same as in 1970. It has matured a lot since then,' says a European official. In his efforts to accommodate as many interests as possible Strong also allowed the Unced agenda to balloon to an enormous size. When Unced was asked to produce cost estimates for the global clean-up, it put them at an astronomical Dollars 625bn a year. With firmer leadership, Strong could have focussed the Rio agenda more tightly, and avoided accusations of financial megalomania. But that is now history. Strong is, needless to say, optimistic about the outcome. There may be fewer treaties on the signing table than was originally hoped, there are still big question marks about aid money, and many of the largest interest groups still fear the Summit will be a sell-out to their rivals, or a massive anti-climax. But Strong stresses that Rio was never intended to come up with a complete environmental rescue plan. What it must mark is 'a credible beginning,' with forceful arrangements to ensure that the great clean-up, once set in motion, keeps going. 'I've been around this for a long time. I've seen the evidence. I believe we are facing an environmental crisis. The planet is more threatened today by the danger to its life systems than it has ever been by war.'</p>

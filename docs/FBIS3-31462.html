"Our operations haven't changed. We are continuing until the  UN makes a decision otherwise," a spokesman at the Rhein-Main  airbase said.    During Thursday night 11 planes dropped 78 tonnes of food,  2.5 tonnes of medical supplies and just under six tonnes of  clothing and blankets, Airman Stuart Camp said.    Since the start of the operation on Feruary 27, 1993, US,  French and German transporter planes have dropped some 16,700  tonnes of food, medical aid and winter supplies, he said.</p>

			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'MOM, THERE'S NOTHING TO DO!';  </P> <P> HERE'S HELP, WITH A PARENT'S, YET KID-FRIENDLY, GUIDE TO SUMMERTIME VIEWING  </P> <P> Many parents actually may survive the summer without having to attend to a  single case of poison oak or swimmer's ear. Few, however, will escape that more  insidious seasonal nuisance: summertime TV.  </P> <P> No matter how parents plan to prevent their kids from squandering the summer  vacation in front of the TV -- by scheduling endless activities, letting the  kids live in the pool or simply locking up the set -- they sooner or later see  the folly of their schemes. The vigilance required to control the TV set lends  the effort that air of futility common to all struggles against nature; parents  might just as well try to keep bees from a rose garden.  </P> <P> The fact is, kids eventually will make time to watch TV. If denied cartoons,  they'll just get up earlier to watch them. They'll misplace their shoes, among  other tactics, to delay banishment from the house. They'll suddenly heed  warnings connecting eating and swimming to stomach cramps, and insist on giving  lunch one more TV show's worth of time to settle before they jump back into the  pool.  </P> <P> Even without VCRs, rarely an hour passes when TV doesn't have something  fetching (if not necessarily suitable) for children, unlike 20 years ago when  the dearth of anything but soap operas and old movies at midday drove kids  outdoors.  </P> <P> Today, Nickelodeon, a basic cable channel, and the Disney Channel, a pay-cable  channel, provide children's entertainment throughout the day, while dozens of  other cable outlets and broadcast stations show cartoons, game shows, reruns  and movies that appeal to children.  </P> <P> The best that parents may be able to do, considering the circumstances, is to  steer their children toward fun, entertaining shows that are untainted by  violence, innuendo, lurid subject matter or mere stupidity. In other words,  they might want to take the time to find shows that are more appropriate for  school-age children than, say, reruns of "Charlie's Angels" or installments of  "Sally Jessy Raphael."  </P> <P> This, too, demands vigilance, but there is a reward for those who succeed. Any  parent who makes it through the next few months without hearing the "Gilligan's  Island" theme song can rest peacefully, knowing he or she has done his bit for  the preservation of a young mind; any parent who doesn't deserves the  aggravation the song invariably induces.  </P> <P> This somewhat abbreviated list assumes a lot: that parents are aware that  anything made by Children's Television Workshop ("Sesame Street" or "3-2-1  Contact") won't just entertain, but might even teach kids something; that  anything with Jim Henson's name attached ("Fraggle Rock," 5:30 a.m. and 3 p.m.  daily TNT) might even be enriching; that any kids' show on PBS ("Wonderworks"  or "Reading Rainbow") has good production values; that the "New Mickey Mouse  Club" on the Disney Channel (5:30 p.m. weekdays) is entertaining. So beyond the  assumptions%  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEW SHOWS  </P> <P> The new children's TV season won't start until fall, except at Nickelodeon,  which gets a jump on the competition this summer. The channel plans to kick off  two new series, transform a weekly show into a daily one and start new seasons  for at least two of its returning programs.  </P> <P> Premieres for two shows are scheduled for July 4: "SK8 TV," everything kids  would want to know about skateboarding, at 9 a.m. and repeated at noon, 4 and 7  p.m.; and "Wild and Crazy Kids," described as a sort of a "That's Incredible!"  for kids, at 9:30 a.m., 12:30, 4:30 and 7:30 p.m. The half-hour "SK8 TV" will  air regularly at 6:30 p.m. Saturdays, beginning July 7. "Wild and Crazy Kids"  assumes its regular time slot, noon and 6:30 p.m. Sunday, July 8.  </P> <P> Both new shows should benefit from the fact they follow Nickelodeon's popular  adventure/sitcom series "Hey, Dude," about a group of teen-agers who work on a  dude ranch. New episodes begin in July, when two new cast members make their  debut. The show airs at 6 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays.  </P> <P> Also, fresh episodes of "Eureeka's Castle," Nickelodeon's 10 - 11 a.m. weekday  offering (7-7:30 a.m.) for pre-schoolers, will begin in August. The series  features a huge cast of puppets, among them an apprentice sorceress named  Eureeka whose spells never quite work as they should.  </P> <P> Although the time has not yet been selected, Nickelodeon plans to add a new  weekday show, "Daily Panic," a half-hour version of "Total Panic," the  channel's Sunday morning game/cartoon/talk show in which the studio audience  participates.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MOVIES AND LIMITED SERIES  </P> <P> Scouring the TV listings will yield a surprising abundance of films and special  series for kids that may have previously been overlooked because of competition  from the better-known syndicated cartoons and reruns.  </P> <P> The Disney Channel Premiere Film series is a source of richly detailed and  emotionally satisfying movies that often harken back to classic children's  fare. This summer watch for "Back Home," featuring Disney child star Hayley  Mills as a British mother trying to help her daughter adjust to life following  World War II. The movie airs this week at 9 a.m. Tuesday and 4 p.m. Saturday.  </P> <P> True classics can be found on a couple of stops on the dial. Monday through  Saturday, check out the 5 p.m. movie on The Family Channel; it might be a film  such as "Black Beauty" or "The Last of the Mohicans." The Movie Channel has its  Cliff Notes Theater, which presents adaptations of classic literature such as  "Ivanhoe" and "The Yearling." And in the coming months the Arts &amp;  Entertainment Network plans to air such films as "Little Lord Fauntleroy,"  "Long John Silver" and "Captain Kidd."  </P> <P> Children may also be swept away by "Avonlea," a Disney Channel series about a  city girl who is sent to live with relatives on rural Prince Edward Island  during the Victorian era. The series is an offshoot of the immensely popular  and critically acclaimed "Anne of Green Gables" and "Anne of Avonlea"  miniseries.  </P> <P> Showtime will continue its animated "Storybook Classics" during the summer.  "The Ugly Duckling," narrated by Cher, airs at 4 p.m. June 21, 25 and 5:30 a.m.  June 22, 26. "The Emporer and the Nightingale" and "Steadfast Tin Soldier" will  be shown in July.  </P> <P> And on Sunday mornings, at 8:30, HBO is presenting "The Wonderful Wizard of  Oz," an animated series based on the L. Frank Baum books.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SERIES, OLD AND NEW  </P> <P> This is one of the most troublesome categories of TV when it comes to kids.  Frequent violence is the only criterion used to judge whether these shows are  fit for kids, and while many may not be overtly harmful, they often lack any  worth beyond mere diversion. Any show a parent deems too dumb for adult  consumption should be so deemed for a child, too.  </P> <P> In prime time, the one sitcom that surpasses expectations for the genre and  interests older children is "The Wonder Years," a remembrance of youth that  rings true for the young and old. It airs at 8:30 p.m. Tuesdays on ABC. For  prime-time drama, ABC also has "Life Goes On," about a middle-class family  riding out the rather ordinary ups and down of life, which airs at 7 p.m.  Sundays on ABC.  </P> <P> On weekdays, several shows from the days when TV producers were more mindful of  young viewers -- and censors -- are still engaging to kids.  </P> <P> "Father Knows Best" is sometimes derided as unrealistic, but what's so bad  about a family that acts civil? Repeats air from noon to 1 p.m. weekdays on The  Family Channel, which also airs an hour of the old "Batman" series, so camp  that even young children get the joke, beginning at 2 p.m.  </P> <P> "The Andy Griffith Show" appears frequently on weekdays: at 5:30 a.m. and 10  a.m. on KTTV, and 3:30 p.m. TBS. What's more wholesome than Aunt Bea's apple  pie?  </P> <P> Another crowd pleaser, of course, is "Leave It To Beaver," on weekdays at 6:30  a.m. on WGN and 8:30 a.m. on KTLA. Nickelodeon carries those other perennial  favorites, "Lassie," 6 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. weekdays, and "Dennis the Menace," at  7 p.m. weekdays.  </P> <P> For drama, repeats of "Little House on the Prairie" air at 11 a.m. weekdays on  KTLA.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ANIMATION  </P> <P> Most of Disney's animation is a good bet, whether classic cartoons on the  Disney Channel or the current syndicated series "Duck Tales" and "Chip 'n  Dale's Rescue Rangers," which follow one another weekdays beginning at 4 p.m.  on KCAL. Also, Disney Channel offers an animated "Fraggle Rock" series at 9  a.m. Saturday and Sunday.  </P> <P> Beyond that, look to Nickelodeon and some of its animated imports for  interesting weekday cartoons. Young children seem especially fond of "Maya the  Bee" at 9:30 a.m., and "David the Gnome," at noon, followed by "The Adventures  of the Little Koala." Other shows such as "Inspector Gadget," at 7:30 a.m. and  5:30 p.m., and "Heathcliff," at 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., hold more interest for older  kids.  </P></p>

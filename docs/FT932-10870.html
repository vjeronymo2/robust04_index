			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (2): Past success brings rewards - Barry Riley analyses the performance of the top managers IT MAY be tough at the top, where the number one pension fund management house Mercury Asset Management had to cope with a boardroom reshuffle last year, but it can be even worse down below. The remarkable process of concentration of external managers in the UK's pension fund sector continued unabated last year. Although MAM suffered a tiny erosion of market share, the next three - Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management, Schroder Investment Management and Barclays de Zoete Wedd Investment Management - all showed gains. Amazingly, however, there are something like 180 management firms actively seeking business from UK pension funds, a total which has been steadily rising. For most the pickings are very thin. But the bulk of them are seeking specialist rather than balanced mandates. And many of the more recent entrants are managers from the US, Japan and Continental Europe seeking to pick up geographical briefs. A few years ago some of the pension consultants, who are influential in manager selection, attempted to shift the arguably excessive focus on past performance. They wanted to emphasise other factors, such as efficiency and levels of client service. However, this has not worked. According to Mr Roger Urwin, who heads the investment section at consultants R. Watson, the 'wish list' presented by trustees has become quite standardised. They want top performance, consistency and also the comfort given by large size. US-style boutiques are generally shunned. A handful of top managers therefore gets nearly all the new business, at least for balanced management. 'Concentration in balanced funds will continue,' he says. 'But one does expect some changes at the top.' One crude way of assessing concentration is to look at the market share of the top four in the FT's annual table, as a proportion of the funds controlled by the leading 20 houses. In 1984 the leading quartet (not then quite the same as the present top four) had a share of 39 per cent. By 1988, this proportion had climbed to 44 per cent, and now it is 51 per cent. The fruits of consistently good performance have been substantial. This year, for the first time, we are printing a table of investment results, following the introduction of a standard code of performance measurement for fund management groups, backed by the National Association of Pension Funds and other industry bodies. Not all the individual management houses have supplied figures. Mercury is the most notable absentee, for reasons which it is reluctant to spell out, but are probably related to the fairly wide dispersion of the results of the hundreds of funds which it manages. Other managers give greater priority to holding individual client returns close to the house median. At any rate, over five years it is clear that PDFM, Gartmore and Schroder among the big houses have achieved outstanding returns. They have therefore been the leading winners of new business. The small independent firm Newton has the best figures of all, and in consequence has been expanding rapidly too, although from a relatively tiny base. BZWIM, another big success story, has a radically different approach. It is the market leader in index-tracking funds, and has picked up a lot of business from rival houses that have performed badly as active managers. Altogether a group of six managers is tending to pull away from the rest, including Prudential Portfolio Managers - although PPM (along with MAM) was unfortunate enough to lose a Pounds 500m slice of the Marks &amp; Spencer fund last year. This happened not because of bad performance but because M&amp;S wished to adopt a low risk indexed approach. Some of the money, incidentally, went to BZWIM. Just outside the top six, managers such as Robert Fleming and County NatWest Investment Management have been finding the going tough, being unable to produce consistently good results. The results of individual years may not mean all that much in such a long-term business as pension fund management, but 1992 turned out to be a brilliant one for Gartmore, which in a few years has moved from nowhere to sixth place in volume terms. It returned an amazing 26.3 per cent in 1992 against a Caps median of 20.6 per cent and a WM weighted average of 18.6. PDFM was not far behind in performance terms. According to the newsletter Global Money Management the top new business winners of 1992 included not only Gartmore, PDFM, Schroder and BZWIM but also Baillie Gifford, the current star of the Scottish firmament. BG is coy about its investment performance, but it has plainly had a very good run. For the time being, however, it is closed for new business as it concentrates on consolidation after its recent rapid expansion. Outside the select few, it is a tough task for firms even to get on to the short list for new mandates. 'There is overcapacity in the balanced fund business,' says Roger Urwin. 'Organisations caught in the middle with relatively poor performance have a difficult task to keep going in the pension fund field.' Robert Fleming, for instance, spoilt its performance numbers last year by moving prematurely back into the Japanese equity market. Mr Iain Saunders, Fleming's investment chief, explains that he is working hard to get the discretionary balanced performance up to scratch, but in the meantime the company is focusing quite successfully on winning specialist accounts. His aim is for steady rather than dramatic performance. 'We aim to achieve a lower risk approach with our mainstream balanced product,' he says. Certainly there are different styles, even among the big balanced managers. Probably Schroder is currently the leading exponent of the consistent, just-above-median style which can be attractive to trustees who want to sleep at nights. But as it happened, Schroder was below the median in 1992. Gartmore's more aggressive style was the one that paid off in a big way last year. Mr David Watts, the company's head of pension funds, says that Gartmore is unusual in deriving about half of its outperformance from strategy, whereas other managers depend mostly on stock selection. Can Gartmore continue to perform as it gets bigger? Mr Watts is determined to persist with a similar approach. 'Other big firms stop taking decisions, but we are backing our judgment,' he says.  --------------------------------------------           POOLED PENSION FUNDS*  --------------------------------------------                                     Pounds bn Scottish Widows                          4.66 Provident Mutual                         2.45 Confederation Life                       2.24 Standard Life                            1.80 Scottish Equitable                       1.41 Prudential                               0.98 Scottish Amicable                        0.88 Mercury Managed Fund Service             0.74 Sun Life                                 0.61 Stenhouse Exempt                         0.53  -------------------------------------------- *Mixed with property as at December 31, 1992  -------------------------------------------- Source: Caps  --------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------       PERFORMANCE OF SEGREGATED FUNDS (TO DECEMBER 31, 1992) (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                       Over 5 years      Over 1 year  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Newton Investment Management             17.2              21.1 Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management          15.6              23.5 Queen Anne's Gate Asset Mngt             15.1              20.5 Gartmore Investment Ltd                  14.6              25.9 Schroder Investment Mngt                 14.4              20.3 James Capel Fund Managers                14.0              20.7 Baring Global Fund Mngrs                 13.7              22.3 Hill Samuel Investment Mngt              13.7              18.6 Rothschild Asset Management              13.7              20.3 M&amp;G                                      13.4              23.3 Prudential Portfolio Mngrs               13.3              20.1 Caps Median Fund                         13.3              20.6 Morgan Grenfell Asset Mngt               13.0              20.0 Hambros Bank                             13.0              20.1 Henderson Pension Fund Mngrs             12.9              20.1 Fleming Investment Mngt                  12.8              17.9 Lloyds Investment Managers               12.8              19.5 Invesco MIM                              12.5              20.5 Scottish Widows                          12.3              18.9 County NatWest Inv Mngt                  11.7              16.7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Figures give median fund total returns, including property where applicable.

			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Greenhouse gas deadline missed THE US administration has missed its self-imposed deadline for producing a plan to curb emissions of gases that contribute to global warming. Instead of completing the plan in time for the two-week international global warming conference which began in Geneva yesterday, White House officials acknowledged they would probably not be ready before the end of next month. The delay means the US has missed an opportunity to provide leadership on the issue at the intergovernmental meeting, and has drawn criticism from some environmental groups. 'Continued delay of the US climate action plan will send the wrong message to the world,' said Mr Bill Eichbaum, of the Worldwide Fund for Nature. Under the climate change convention agreed at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro last year, countries will be required to come up with action plans to restrain their emissions of warming gases - principally carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, methane and nitrous oxides - to their 1990 level by the year 2000. The US is the world's largest source of greenhouse gases, with an estimated 5.2bn tons emitted in 1990. Emissions are projected to grow by 125m-200m tons this decade. The task of devising a plan to curb US emissions has been complicated by the Clinton administration's failure to persuade Congress to agree a significant energy tax. Issues for discussion at the Geneva meeting include a common measurement standard and how to account for joint projects by two or more countries. Officials will also discuss 'joint implementation' - the extent to which a country can claim credit against its own emissions target for financing projects in another country which can achieve the same overall effect more cheaply. Funding for developing country projects is another contentious issue. While up to Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) may be available over the next three years through the Global Environment Facility run jointly by the UN and the World Bank, it has yet to be decided which countries should benefit and what types of project should qualify.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Shi Da (2514 6671): "What Kind of Stuff Is the British </F> Side's So-called `Being Fair and Open?'--Also Commenting on the  White Paper on 'Representative Government in Hong Kong'"]    [Text] Not long ago, without consulting its Chinese  counterpart, the British side published a "White Paper" entitled  "Representative Government in Hong Kong" and unilaterally made  public its carefully drawn up contents of the talks. If one  reads the "White Paper," one immediately finds that the whole  thing is wrappe in a beautiful and ear-pleasing phrase--"being  fair and open." Why does the British side have such a  partiality for the phrase? What actually are they all about?  Is their election proposal as "fair and open" as they have  trumpeted? These are questions this article intends to answer.    First of all, let us have a look at the statements in the  "White Paper" on several important issues relating to elections.    On the election of functional constituencies, completely  ignoring the understandings which China and Britain had reached  and the Basic Law's clear stipulation that the election of  functional constituencies will be by indirect elections, the  "White Paper" states: "The British Government and the Hong Kong  Government maintain that the functional constituency system must  meet the conditions of being fair and open" and "as far as the  newly added nine functional constituencies are concerned, the  governor suggested that the simplest and most fair way was to  let them embrace all the working population. On this basis, the  governor suggested setting up nine additional functional  constituencies by continuing to adopt the existing method of  determining trades and professions." It was precisely under the  pretense of the so-called "being fair and open" that the British  side violated its original intention to design functional  constituency elections and set up nine new functional  constituencies on the basis of trades and professions, thus  expanding the electorate of functional constituencies from under  100,000 to 2.7 million people overnight. At the same time, the  British side changed the corporate voting into individual  voting. In this way, functional constituency elections have  become direct elections based on trades and professions in a  certain form. Although during the process of talks the British  side made some revisions on its proposal, it still stuck to its  own basic stand. In this regard, the "White Paper" explains:  The revised British side's proposal "accords with the minimum  requirements of fair and open functional constituencies."    On the formation of the election committee issue, China and  Britain concluded an agreement as long ago as early-1990,  namely, the election committee will be formed in accordance with  the number of members from various sectors and ratio as  stipulated by Annex I, Article 2 of the Basic Law. However, in  its "White Paper," the British side flatly denied it, arguing  that both sides "have not reached any agreement" and attacking  the Chinese proposal to form the election committee in  accordance with the formula prescribed in the Annex I, Article 2  of the Basic Law as "not meeting the necessary requirements and  therefore cannot provide a fair and open election method." The  "White Paper" says: "The election committee itself should be  composed of the people who are elected in Hong Kong in an open  and fair way." It was precisely according to this logic that  the British side suggested that the election committee "be  composed entirely or partially of directly elected district  members." During the talks, through patient reasoning from the  Chinese side, the British side agreed to act according to the  relevant stipulations of Annex I, Article 2 of the Basic Law  concerning the number of members from the first three sectors  and the ratio of the election committee but persisted in  replacing the people from the fourth sector prescribed in Annex  I, Article 2 of the Basic Law with the representatives of  regional organizations. One of its reasons was that the Hong  Kong deputies to the National People's Congress and Hong Kong  members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference in this portion of people "are  not elected in Hong Kong in an open and fair way."    On the issue of voting method to be used in direct elections  for the district boards, the "White Paper" terms the  single-seat, single- vote system which the British side  persisted in adopting as an important content of "fair and open"  elections and attacked the multiple-seat, single-vote system  which was proposed by the Chinese side as "unable to provide a  fair and open system."    On the election of district boards and two municipal  councils, the "White Paper" says: "In October 1992 the governor  proposed that all members of district boards and municipal  councils be directly elected" and the "governor's proposal  completely accords with open and fair elections."    From what we have cited above we can clearly see that the  trick practiced by the British side in its "White Paper" is to  replace and make a figurehead the three principles on which  China and Britain had decided through consultations to conduct  their talks, including the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the  principle of convergence with the Basic Law, and the agreements  and understandings which China and Britain had agreed, to use  the argument of "being fair and open," an out-and-out subjective  thing, as a yardstick with which to weigh things and judge right  and wrong. In this way, the British side will be able to act as  it wishes--all proposals which are put forward by the British  side are "fair and open" and all proposals which it opposes are  not "fair and open," thus achieving the objective of Chris  Patten's "three violations" political reform package. This is  the real reason the British side has such a partiality for, and  has preached endlessly about, the argument of "being fair and  open."    Is the election proposal put forward by the British side  actually in complete conformity with the alleged standard of  "being fair and open?" Let the facts speak for themselves.    On the election of functional constituencies. Of the nine  new functional constituencies, four include employees who are  trade union members. They are the public utility and  telecommunications constituency, the recreation and service  trade constituency, the land, construction engineering, housing,  and building industry constituency, and the fishery,  agriculture, mining, and manufacturing constituency.    The British side separated this small number of employees  from Hong Kong's 850,000 working population and adopted a  different voting method from the two labor seats in the existing  21 seats (the British proposal is to expand from the original  labor community's voting method of one trade union, one vote  into one trade union secretary, one vote and adopt a one-person,  one-vote method among the nine new constituencies). This method  is both unfair and unreasonable. Moreover, In certain  constituencies, the British side lumped together employees in a  certain trade and employers or professionals in the trade.  Whose interests do council members elected this way actually  represent? This way of doing things adopted by the British side  can hardly be said to be fair. Moreover, considering that Hong  Kong's current commercial community is composed of three  aspects: Foreign capital, foreign nationals of Chinese origin  in Hong Kong, and China-funded enterprises. The first two  capitals have their representatives in Legco and only  China-funded enterprises do not have any representative in the  ocuncil, the Chinese side suggested nominating the "Association  of Chinese-Funded Enterprises" as a functional constituency.  However, the British side tried every possible means to reject  the proposal, adopting a discriminatory attitude toward  China-funded enterprises. Can this be justified as being fair?  Moreover, in its "White Paper," the British side says: "The  Chinese side wants to adopt electoral arrangements with more  restrictions and a much smaller number of voters. Of the  functional constituencies they suggested, the smallest  constituency has just under 100 voters. Under this arrangement,  elections can possibly be manipulated." However, in fact, among  the existing functional constituencies in the Legco, the number  of voters of two functional constituencies is much smaller than  that of the functional constituency suggested by the Chinese  side. Moreover, it was precisely one of the two functional  constituencies that was manipulated in the 1991 elections.  Instead of examining its own conscience, the British side made  such an accusation against China. This way of doing things is  too far away from being fair.    On the election of the election committee. The British  proposal was that the election committee would be composed of  346 district board members who were directly elected. This  means that the 346 members would elect 10 Legco members. In  this wau, so long as 35 district board members join hands, they  will be able to elect a Legco member. In fact, for one to  become a Legco member, it will be not an especially difficult  job for him or her to find a way to garner the support of 35  district board members. The British side attacked the Chinese  proposal saying that "the scope of voters is so small that it  will possibly lead to corrupt and fraudulent practices." Is  this precisely not its own portrayal? This British so-called  "fair and open" proposal is really too bad to be complimented.    On the voting method of direct elections based on districts.  In the "White Paper," the British side termed its own  single-seat, single-vote system as an important content of "fair  and open" elections and attacked the Chinese proposal of  multiple seat, single vote because "it cannot provide a fair and  open system." This British argument completely does not hold  water. A single-seat, single-vote system is a majority voting  system. But it has a shortcoming, namely, the emergence of "an  excessive gain in seats" or "an excessive loss of seats." As  society develops, many people maintain that this method is  unfair and it is a violation of democratic principles and a  proportional representation system has thus been designed. The  multiple-seat, single-vote system is the mixture of the majority  voting system and the proportional representation system. From  the viewpoint of the development of voting systems, the  multiple-seat, single-vote system must be said to be more fair  than the single-seat, single-vote system. In fact, all voting  systems have their own strong and weak points. It is hard to  say which one is more fair and reasonable than the other. Hong  Kong must proceed from its own realities in adopting its voting  methods.    On the issue of appointed seats in district boards and  municipal councils. Chairmen and members of the Hong Kong  District Boards and the two municipal councils universally  opposed the elimination of appointed membership. Ignoring their  demands, the British side acted willfully and persisted in  eliminating appointed membership. With this practice, it is out  of the question for the British side to speak about "being fair  and open." Moreover, the practice runs counter to the remark  the British side has repeatedly uttered in its "White Paper"  that "we abide by the will of the Hong Kong people."    In the "White Paper," to shirk the responsibility for  breaking the talks, the British side tried every means to  conceal the real situation in the talks. Not only did they  wantonly distort and attack the Chinese side's position but also  deliberately cut out many important details detrimental to  itself. At the same time, it created various false impressions  to cheat good and honest people. Sham is sham and the mask must  be stripped off. The British side has repeatedly talked glibly  about "being fair and open" but the more it tries to cover up  its real intentions, the more exposed it becomes.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  held regular consultations Thursday [19 May] in Tokyo on ways to  improve foreign access to Japan's paper market.    The biannual meeting was held to evaluate implementation of  a  set of measures both parties agreed during the paper trade talks  in April 1992.    A U.S. official who attended the meeting told reporters that  the two countries discussed "several areas" of the world's  second largest paper and paperboard market. But he refused to  disclose the contents of the talks.    The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, only said,  "we have yet to see results confirming a substantial increase in  foreign access to the Japanese market."    The official said the foreign share of the Japanese paper  market was only 3.9 percent at the end of 1993, up only 0.2  percentage point from 1991. The official cited what Washington  views as "the highly structured distribution system" and  "discriminatory corporate purchasing practices" as major factors  to thwart smooth American penetration of the 32 billion dollar  market.    Due to these "systemic obstacles, persistent and strong  efforts by the world-class competitor" in other markets have not  been rewarded, the official said.</p>

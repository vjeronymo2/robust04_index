			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Kuznets report under the "Hearings" rubric: </F> "Government Plans To Liberalize Foreign Trade Over Resistance of  Deputies and Bureaucrats"]    [Text] At the State Duma hearings on foreign economic  policy yesterday officials from the Foreign Economic Relations  Ministry [FERM], the government staff, the Finance Ministry, and  the Central Bank told the deputies about the state of affairs in  the area of foreign trade. The FERM report called the  introduction of higher import tariffs "a forced protectionist  measure." The FERM expects that domestic producers will spend  their profits on lowering production costs and raising the  quality of goods in order gradually to achieve world standards  in these indicators. As for the inflationary effect of the  increase in import tariffs, the FERM said that the fiscal side  to the new measure would "offset" the natural growth in the  prices of goods, thus increasing budget revenues.    Along with import tariffs, export tariffs have also been  imposed. However, they are "aimed at liberalizing exports." The  FERM sees this step as a transition from state monopoly to free  trade. By mid-1995 it is expected fully to abolish export  quotas and licenses, the institution of special exporters, and  other "non-economic" controls over the export of goods. As for  the tariffs, they will become "the rein that the government will  slowly loosen."    The result of the country's foreign economic activity in  1993  was a trade surplus of $16 billion. It is impossible to channel  the entire amount to investment in production and so forth  because one- third of it is spent on bringing into Russia  foreign cash that ends up being kept by the population and banks  as savings, and another third goes to service the foreign and  domestic hard-currency debts.    Hard-currency earnings have also been hit by the release of  Russian commodities onto the world market at dumping prices.  Budget revenues have been dented by various foreign economic  benefits granted to regions, sectors, and enterprises. In 1995  most benefits may be "suspended," while expenditures on  centralized imports will be halted.    The general trend toward foreign trade liberalization will  encounter resistance by domestic producers, however, who demand  state protection and benefits, and will also meet open  obstruction from government bureaucrats. For instance, Mr.  Tsyplakov, government staff official dealing with foreign trade  problems, said that "given the complete collapse of the economy  it is a mistake for the state to give up its monopoly in foreign  economic ties." Many deputies who attended the hearings  yesterday shared his stance.</p>

			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JAPAN PREMIER TO APOLOGIZE FOR WAR ACTS  </P> <P> Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said today that he will apologize for Japan's  wartime aggression when he meets South Korea's president next week, but the  government is less willing to have the emperor make a similar statement.  </P> <P> "I think I should express frank regret about our mistakes in the past and  apologize for them," Kaifu told Parliament.  </P> <P> He was responding to an opposition question about news reports that South  Korean President Roh Tae Woo expects an apology from Emperor Akihito during the  president's three-day trip to Japan, which begins May 24.  </P> <P> Japan ruled Korea as a colony from 1910 to 1945, and Koreans have bitter  memories of harsh treatment under the Japanese, along with the legacy of their  country's division since the war's end.  </P> <P> Leaders of Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party expressed strong  opposition to a royal apology.  </P></p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy pressure on Bass TALK OF further downgrades following presentations by the company sent Bass tumbling and pulled down other brewing and hotel groups in its wake. Analysts said worries over trading at Holiday Inns, particularly in continental Europe, had been raised at the meetings. Domestic brewing margins were also said to be under pressure as Bass responded to an aggressive push for market share by Courage. Other concerns highlighted by analysts included higher than expected interest charges, and margins on soft drinks following an increase in sugar prices. After James Capel's downgrade on Monday, yesterday saw UBS Phillips &amp; Drew snipping its forecasts and a number of other houses ready to follow suit. However, while weakness is seen in the short term domestic brewing market, many analysts still regard Bass as a positive long term investment. The shares closed 10 adrift at 583p after turnover of 4.2m. The bearish news on Bass dragged on other domestic drinks stocks. Whitbread 'A' declined 7 to 481p and Scottish &amp; Newcastle 3 to 462p. Queens Moat Houses, which has franchises for some Holiday Inns, dipped 3 to 47p in heavy volume of 6.6m. The stock was also disturbed by a negative note from NatWest Securities which suggested that the hotel group may be adversely affected by the new accounting procedures.</p>

The official letter, sent in the name of the assistant  secretary of state, said that foreign legal service is needed in  South Korea in order to protect U.S. interests as an increasing  number of American companies are investing in Korea, according  to Justice Ministry officials.    Kim Yong-chol, a specialist on international law at the  Ministry, said, however, that Seoul should tell the U.S. side  that the market cannot be opened since legal service in Korea,  which works basically for the benefit of the public rather than  individuals, has fundamentally different characteristics from  that of the United States.</p>

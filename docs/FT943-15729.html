			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (3): A platform for policy - While it is not a trade policeman, Jon Marks finds that the Paris-based organisation is able to exert considerable influence over the way exporters do business / The OECD The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade makes rules regulating global trade. The European Commission intervenes to remove distortions to trade within the EU's single market. The IMF and other Bretton Woods institutions provide economic policy frameworks and financing flows. But in the universe inhabited by multilateral institutions the role of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is less clear. Since its foundation in 1960, the Paris-based organisation has provided a talking shop and platform for industrialised nations to recommend policy measures for enactment by its 25 member states. The OECD's powers to enforce policy are much weaker than those of other multilaterals. 'Members agree to play by the rules, but it does not mean becoming a trade policeman,' an official in Paris says. Even so, the OECD may still exert considerable influence over the way that exporters do business - and in some cases it may intervene directly in a deal. To promote a 'level playing field' in international trade, the OECD has taken a lead in curbing the use of subsidies and controlling the use of export credits, which it regulates through the consensus rate. It has sought to influence policy in areas from competition policy to criminal activity, and could expand its influence into other trade-related activities, such as the provision of export credit insurance. The OECD exerts its influence through the application of 'peer pressure' on each of its 22 member states, who are urged to follow its recommendations, even if they are not obliged to enact them as law. In April, Mexico became the first new member for more than two decades. Further expansion will follow, changing the look of the OECD. On 8 June, the OECD's annual ministerial meeting approved the start of negotiations on membership with four central European 'partners in transition' - the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia - and with South Korea, one of the group the OECD calls DNMEs or 'dynamic non-members economies'. Seoul wants to join by 1996, the year when talks with the central Europeans may open. In Latin America, Mexico may be followed by three other DNMEs: Argentina, Chile and Brazil. The OECD has a new co-operation agreement with the Russian Federation and is committed to building closer links with China. This is essential if the OECD is to reflect the economic realities of the next decade - and to bring Beijing into the OECD fold. China's attraction to exporters, its capacity to absorb credit and insistence on obtaining the cheapest possible interest rate means that the most notifications of the unfair use of aid funding and application of sub-consensus export credits have been received for contracts there. The use of subsidised credits has been monitored, since the OECD's ministerial meeting in 1991, by a committee based in Paris. The 'Helsinki rules' committee aims to ensure that aid finance is only offered on the basis of developmental criteria, rather than national interest. 'Only a small part of official cover and development aid for projects comes under scrutiny, but there is some business where you meet it every day,' says to an official working with the Helsinki rules. This is especially the case for telecommunications, power and other projects which may be financed from alternative commercial sources. The Helsinki rules apply to financing of more than two years for all contracts, except military and agricultural deals. The OECD Helsinki group meets 11 times a year, when governments present potentially aid-funded projects for consideration and hear complaints against competitors whom suppliers say are using subsidised credits to obtain unfair advantage. 'We are building up a history of cases and we have the feeling that project promoters are getting a better understanding of the procedures,' a Helsinki committee official says. 'Either governments know the financing will not pass, so they do not even propose it, or they know the project is good and feel secure enough to present it to the committee'. There are several grey areas, however. 'An application to fund a telecommunications project in the capital could turn out to be very different from an application for similar work in a rural area,' the official says. To iron out other forms of distortions to international trade, the OECD's competition law and policy trade committees have been working on issues such as anti-dumping. Other committees are examining criminal activity. There are plans to introduce measures to control money laundering worldwide by 1999. 'Our goal is that all countries with significant financial centres should implement our recommendations in the next five years,' John Gieve, under-secretary at the UK treasury and chairman of the OECD's financial action task force on money laundering (FATF), said in June this year. Bribery in international business transactions is the next target. The OECD has produced a recommendation on bribery which, it says, 'is the first multilateral agreement among governments to combat bribery of foreign officials'. Recommendations include making payments to foreign officials illegal (but not to private business people) and removing their tax deductible status, says Mark Plieth, the Swiss official chairing the working group. The new OECD anti-bribery code will draw on the FATF's money-laundering experience. The OECD could play a new role in other areas of trade policy. One is the global harmonising of levels of insurance cover provided by export credit agencies (ECAs). There is a long way to go before European, North American and Asian practice comes together to provide a level playing field for ECA cover. In the pipeline is a ground-breaking recommendation on exports by shipbuilders. For the first time this would introduce binding arbitration and damages in commercial procedures between states, as well as for companies. The potential for the OECD to become more than just a rich nation's club has given impetus to the competition to appoint a new secretary-general for the end of September. Whoever emerges from the four candidates, among them the incumbent, Jean-Claude Paye, the decision, in keeping with OECD conventions, must be reached by consensus.</p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> STATE WON'T ALLOW VOTE ON SPLIT DISTRICT;  </P> <P> EASTSIDERS DENIED CHANCE TO BREAK UP PALOS VERDES SCHOOLS  </P> <P> Palos Verdes school board members Jeffrey Younggren and Jack Bagdasar shared a  jubilant victory hug Friday after the State Board of Education announced its  long-awaited decision: Voters on the east side of the school district will not  be allowed to decide if they want to secede.  </P> <P> Moments after the board's 6-3 vote, an elated Younggren declared that the  action ends "two years of warfare" with a parents group that has sought to  split the Palos Verdes Peninsula School District since 1987, when the local  board proposed closing Miraleste High School.  </P> <P> Younggren said the district can make plans to close the school as soon as the  district issues a court-ordered environmental impact report.  </P> <P> "I think we need to vote and go ahead," said Younggren, president of the board.  "The environmental impact report is coming soon. As soon as we have that we'll  (prepare to) close the school next fall."  </P> <P> Despite Friday's action, the bitter dispute seems far from settled as both  sides gear up for new skirmishes.  </P> <P> "It really doesn't bring the matter to an end," said Ted Gibbs, a spokesman for  the parents group, the East Peninsula Education Council. "It brings this  portion of the matter to an end."  </P> <P> Gibbs said his group could petition the state board for a new hearing once the  Palos Verdes school board completes the court-ordered environmental review of  the proposed Miraleste closure and past school closings throughout the  district.  </P> <P> Gibbs said he would have preferred that the state board postpone any action  until after the November election. Three former EPEC leaders are among seven  candidates running for three seats.  </P> <P> One of those candidates, Peter Gardiner, said in an interview that the state  panel's action makes the election "that much more important." He conceded that  if he and the other two former leaders of the group who are running are  perceived by voters as one-issue candidates interested primarily in keeping  Miraleste open, it will be tough for them to win as a slate.  </P> <P> Although all three have said they would not favor splitting the district if  elected, they would vote to keep Miraleste open and to shake up the district's  present management, including firing Supt. Jack Price.  </P> <P> </P> <P> East Side Voters Outnumbered  </P> <P> Only about 25% of the peninsula's voters live on the east side, a factor that  could work against the three candidates. Only 15% to 20% of the people residing  on the peninsula have school-age children.  </P> <P> The Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District encompasses Rolling Hills,  Rolling Hills Estates, Rancho Palos Verdes and Palos Verdes Estates. Enrollment  has declined from a peak of 17,742 students to about 9,300. As a result, the  district in recent years has closed seven schools and has sold six parcels of  land that had been earmarked for future school construction.  </P> <P> The proposed eastern district would have included 1,700 students from Rolling  Hills, the eastern side of Rancho Palos Verdes and a portion of Rolling Hills  Estates.  </P> <P> According to a staff report to the state board in July, the proposed district  "would not significantly disrupt the quality of education being provided to the  children in either school district."  </P> <P> But a majority of the state board, which had delayed action on the issue  earlier this year and failed to reach a final decision in July, viewed the  secession in a different light.  </P> <P> In an interview, board member Kenneth Peters said that if the panel had delayed  the decision again, "all we would do is keep the pot boiling even more so."  </P> <P> He maintained that the proposed new district could not conduct "a comprehensive  program that all secondary students need." Peters, former superintendent of the  Beverly Hills schools, also said he needed to have a compelling reason to break  up the existing Palos Verdes district.  </P> <P> Also siding with the majority was the board's student member, Paras Mehta, a  senior at Cerritos High School, who recently joined the panel. Both sides had  suggested that Mehta was a swing vote on the board, but Mehta said he rejected  the election petition because breaking up the district "could impact  educational programs."  </P> <P> Several state board members said they had received a letter from Assemblyman  Gerald N. Felando (R-San Pedro) asking them to delay action until January.  Felando could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Joseph D. Carrabino, a board member from Encino, said he favored putting off  the vote until after the election because he didn't want to influence the  outcome.  </P> <P> EPEC spokesman Gibbs said he believes that, no matter what the result of the  election, "we should maintain K-12 education on the east side of the hill."  </P> <P> Gibbs asserted that the Palos Verdes district, by closing east side schools,  has "created a de facto west side school district which in a sense isolates and  ignores the rights and needs of a substantial portion of the community."  </P> <P> But Younggren expressed the hope that the state board action will put a halt to  "this nonsense" and allow the Palos Verdes officials to focus on the  educational needs of their students.  </P> <P> He said after Miraleste is closed as a high school, he would support converting  it into an intermediate school and community center. He said he would not  support the sale of the Miraleste property.  </P> <P> As a result, he asserted, the east side dissidents "will have a lot of what  they're asking for. They won't have everything, but I don't have everything."  </P></p>

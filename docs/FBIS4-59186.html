			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Fairy Tales in US Policy"] </F>   [Text] There is no mistaking the escalating intimidation of  India as Washington prepares to receive P.V. Narasimha Rao.  After the firm reiteration by the Under-Secretary of State, Lynn  Davis, of the US resolve to go through with the supply of F-16s  in return for capping Pakistan's nuclear programme, the Chairman  of the House of Foreign Affairs Committee, Lee Hamilton, has  fired a more menacing missile at New Delhi. If Davis ostensibly  tried to put the record straight without undue provocation, the  high-ranking Democratic Congressman had no difficulty in taking  a sledgehammer approach. Hamilton convinced himself that the  cause of nuclear non-proliferation is so great, that he, as a  prominent law-maker of the lane superpower is entitled to put  India in its place. Quite forgetting the US's shameful record on  the subject in north-east Asia.    China is unabashedly a nuclear-weapons power and so the US  has realised the limits of its capacity to brow-beat that  country into meekly falling in line on the non-proliferation  issue. But Washington has found it next to impossible so far to  whip even North Korea into obedience although it is only  suspected to be trying to achieve nuclear-weapons capability.  After months of threatening Kim Il Sung of dire consequences if  he refuses to permit full inspection of his nuclear facilities,  the Clinton administration seems to be toying with the idea of  defusing the tension on the Korean peninsula, at least for the  time being, by going some way to placate the communist dictator.  What else could be the meaning of the recent statement of the  Defence Secretary, William Perry, when he says the US aims "to  try to keep North Korea from getting a significant nuclear  weapons capability". The climb-down makes a mockery of the  American alarm over the suspected North Korean nuclear programme  in the past year.    It is difficult to resist the impression that it is  non-proliferation idealism rather than a realistic appraisal of  apprehended nuclear dangers that has prompted specific US  policies towards each area in question. This factor coupled with  Clinton's desperate need to register a notable foreign policy  triumph -- especially a clear headway in giving an impetus to  non-proliferation -- is really behind the American fixation  about the assumed nuclear confrontation in South Asia. Recently  Shanghai hosted a conference of experts from China, Pakistan,  India and the US on the nuclear issue in Asia. According to the  former lndian Foreign Secretary, A. P. Venkateswaran, Indian as  well as Pakistani participants in the conference stated  categorically that there is no likelihood of a nuclear conflict  between their countries. It is time Clinton took a second look  at his list of priorities. If he does so sincerely, there is  just a chance of his realising that there is no case for a cold  war against India on the nuclear issue.</p>

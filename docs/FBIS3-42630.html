			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by O. Lystopad: "A Graveyard With an Area of </F> 420,000 Square Kilometers"]    [Text] Recently, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine  issued Decree No. 867 on Pollution Abatement Measures in the  Northwestern Section of the Black Sea in the Odessa Area. The  measures envisioned by the decree--the repair of existing  systems and the construction of new sewer, water-treatment, and  water supply systems in Odessa, the removal of the Odessa Oil  Refinery, the Odessa oil tank farm, and the oil harbor beyond  the city limits of Odessa--have been the cherished dream of all  Odessa "greens."    However, the joy is overshadowed by the understanding that  these measures are the "payoff" for the construction, in the  vicinity of Odessa, of an oil terminal designed to receive 40  million tonnes of oil a year. It will cause a multitude of  ecological problems. Let us examine them beginning with the  end--the end of the Black Sea and the resorts of Odessa.  Unfortunately, this is not an exaggeration. Here are the  statistics: When each tonne of refinery products is offloaded,  70 grams, on the average, spill into the sea (the water area of  the port). A trifle? However, these 70 grams must be multiplied  by 40 million. Here we are! That sounds more convincing--2,800  tonnes, all the more so because, according to calculations by  Professor O.H. Mironov (the Sevastopol branch of the Institute  of Biology of the Southern Seas), the self-cleaning capacity of  the Black Sea comes to only 2,600 tonnes a year. Therefore, dear  gentlemen, you may strike the Odessa area from the list of  Ukrainian resorts. The difference of 200 tonnes will suffice in  order to dirty the entire Bay of Odessa and all the beaches of  Odessa from Luzanivka to Chornomorka: One cubic meter of oil  spills in a film that covers 10 square kilometers! As a result,  the functioning of the "water area-atmosphere" system is  disrupted, along with uncontrollable climatic changes, and  phytoplankton (that is, the lungs of the sea) die en masse. The  further it goes, the worse it becomes. Crustaceans and worms  perish, as do fish, because of famine and suffocation. New fish  will not hatch, because the spawn will have perished even  earlier. We will not be the only ones left without fish: There  will be none in the Black Sea; after all, the Odessa bank  ensures 70 percent of the biological productivity of the sea.  This is a maternity ward from which 60 percent of all Black Sea  fish come. What about the people? Some will be looking for  work--fishing kolkhozes and other enterprises whose names begin  with "fishing" will be ruined. Others, those who have managed to  catch and eat the fish, will be patients in oncologic hospitals:  Toxic components of oil may accumulate in fish in large amounts.  In addition, an accident may occur at the 25-kilometer-long  pipeline, and an accident involving oil intake equipment.  Finally, there are tanker accidents. Let us once again turn to  statistics that testify that there is an upward trend in the  number of accidents with large oil spills: in 1986--one  accident, in 1987--five accidents, in 1988--21 accidents, and in  1989--39 accidents! The sea in the Odessa area resembles  Deribasivska Street in Odessa itself. However, a collision of  two pedestrians on Deribasivska causes nothing but a colorful  shouting match, whereas a similar collision at sea will end in  more than a shouting match.    Supporters of the terminal respond to the danger of  pollution  of the sea with oil: We will call in oil-sweeper vessels, and  they will clean everything up. S.K. Dolinskiy, chief of the  State Inspectorate for the Protection of the Black Sea, is  considerably more pessimistic: They will succeed in cleaning up  only 10 percent of the spilled oil. Incidentally, if one of our  tankers "splashes" oil somewhere close to someone else's shores,  we will have to pay large fines and compensation for damages.  Turkey has stated its reluctance to let our tankers through its  straits for a reason. After all, the risk of collision increases  many times over in these narrow sea passages. Is there an  opportunity to reduce risk? Yes! First, tankers should be  unloaded in a closed port. The oil harbor that operates in  Odessa is ready to receive 4 million tonnes of oil right now, 8  million tonnes after two weeks of work on its reconstruction,  and 12 million tonnes in two months--as much as the first phase  of the terminal is designed to receive. It will be the same  amount of oil, but less money for reconstruction. Besides, as  has already been noted, it will be cheaper. Almost 90 percent of  the oil may be cleaned up in the enclosed space of the harbor,  and the rest will pollute only the harbor itself. If  reconstruction is carried out in keeping with the requirements  of the "greens," the issue of removing the harbor beyond the  city limits may be obviated. The collective of the port of  Odessa has submitted such proposals to all interested echelons.  Somehow, nobody has responded. Was it because they would have to  travel to Odessa rather than England for negotiations?    The reduced tonnage of oil tanker vessels is another way to  prevent accidents--tankers one-third the size of those that  carry 100,000-150,000 tonnes. Such vessels may be built at our  shipbuilding plants in Kerch, Kherson, and Nikolayev. Instead,  orders "sail" to the Federal Republic of Germany, for some  reason. Our countrymen are being left without work, while the  government intends to keep German shipyard workers fed.    We have already mentioned the advantage of business trips  abroad over local ones. Could this be a more serious issue? But  then it falls within the jurisdiction of the Security Service to  clarify it. The Security Service should also evaluate this  entire project from the point of view of security. This will  simply be a juicy morsel for terrorists, both domestic and  foreign. If the maritime segment of the terminal is sabotaged,  the entire country will be left without "black blood." On-shore  installations are even more attractive. They are located side by  side with the Odessa plant adjacent to the port. In addition to  burning oil, there will be ammonia clouds that will turn Odessa  and its vicinity into one big cemetery within a few hours. If  the Security Service has no time to work on this, the military  may be asked to. They have considerable experience in operating  terminals. If there is such a predicament, then why build a new  terminal? Could we not use the existing terminals of the Black  Sea Fleet? Implement conversion!    Enough talking about the Security Service and the Ministry  of  Defense. There is, after all, a special Ministry! Of  Environmental! Protection! This is who should be sounding the  alarm! To be sure, the Ministry of Environmental Protection  objects to the entire project, and is even demanding that the  designers explain: Why do we need specifically 40 million tonnes  of oil? However, the ministry did consent to the first phase,  failing to understand that having said "A," it will have to say  "B." The reason for this decision may be that, although the  ministry has enough qualified experts at the middle and lower  levels, it is still run by, putting it mildly, nonprofessionals.    Therefore, some oil should be brought in through the oil  harbor, and some through the terminals of the Black Sea Fleet.  What about the rest? Could it be that even this is enough? Who  said that we need precisely 40 million tonnes of oil? Does this  40 million include the 8 million tonnes that our traders shipped  across the border (incidentally, once again, where was the  Security Service?).    An interesting fact: Some give the number of 100-150 million  tonnes, rather than 40 million. Here is another one: According  to data from the Odessa Social and Ecological Alliance, yet  another oil refinery in the vicinity of Odessa is being  designed. The design of the terminal itself provides for an  outer harbor--an installation that is intended to export rather  than import oil. The following picture emerges: We receive oil,  refine it, give 50 percent back to the owner of the oil, and  keep 50 percent, along with all the smoke, dust, smog, and so  on. Beautiful, is it not? The "gasoline" problem will be solved.  Hail to the "banana" Republic of Ukraine! We will sell out the  health of our citizens, but in exchange we will have food to  feed them with so that they will not rise up and demand early  elections to the Supreme Council.</p>

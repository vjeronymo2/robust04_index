			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Taba, 15 Feb (MENA)--Hasan 'Asfur, deputy head of  the Palestinian delegation to the Palestinian-Israeli Security  Committee, has stated that the two sides have narrowed the gap  in their viewpoints and are now close to reaching an agreement  on the Palestinian Police Force. He said he hoped such an  agreement would be signed in the next 24 hours.    Following two rounds of talks in Taba today, 'Asfur said the  differences between the two delegations concern numbers more  than principles. They are differences about the size of the  police force and the type of weapons. He stressed that these  differences are not substantial. He added: We will continue to  discuss these issues and we hope we will reach agreement in the  next 24 hours.    'Asfur said that a timetable for the gradual release of  Palestinian detainees is expected to be discussed this evening.    General Amnon Shahaq, head of the Israeli delegation, said  the talks have made progress. He hinted that an agreement might  be signed by the end of the week and added: I believe we can  give details in this regard by the end of the week. [passage  omitted]    'Asfur said the arming of the Palestinian police force is  still under discussion. He added that the Israeli side has  agreed in principle for the Palestinian police to use armored  cars, noting that the number of these vehicles and armored  personnel carriers is currently being discussed with the Israeli  delegation.    He pointed out that the current controversy over the size of  the Palestinian police force is whether the number should be  10,000 or 6,000. He said there is a possibility of resolving  this issue, which is primarily technical.    He said that the issue of joint patrols will be discussed  within the Joint Coordination and Cooperation Committee as of  tomorrow morning, Wednesday. He added that the Palestinian  delegation requested the institution of coastal guard patrols,  noting that the Israeli side does not object to this in  principle. He added that the dispute is over the number of the  patrol members and stressed the need for Palestinian police on  the Mediterranean coast.    'Asfur, deputy head of the Palestinian side of the  Palestinian-Israeli Security Committee, said the Palestinian  detainees in the Golan and in Israeli prisons will be discussed  this evening. He expressed his hope that all issues concerning  the release of Palestinian detainees according to a clear  timetable will be addressed.    He added: We already have an Israeli stand [mawqif] on the  release of the detainees. He affirmed the need to reach  agreement on a timetable for the release of all detainees by  July, in time for the Palestinian council elections due that  month.    He pointed out that the Palestinian side had previously  proposed a complete timetable for the detainees' release in  groups, on condition that all the detainees, who number over  9,000, be freed without exception. He stressed the need to free  all the detainees, including those arrested after the signing of  the Palestinian-Israeli accord on 13 September.    It is noteworthy that the Palestinian side demands that  there  be 9,000 in the Palestinian police force. It also demands that  this force be divided up after civilian authority is transferred  to the Palestinians into a police unit belonging to the  Palestinian Public Security Department--a unit that will provide  security for personnel and property--plus a national security  force to be stationed on the borders with Israel, and a  Palestinian civil defense unit that will include first aid, fire  department, and rescue squads.</p>

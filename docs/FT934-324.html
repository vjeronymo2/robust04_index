			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Consumers and industry set to spur US growth US businesses and consumers are getting ready to spend heavily on big investments, raising hopes of strong growth next year. Government and private sector economists say the recovery looks likely to be sustained well into 1994 as consumers buy cars and houses, while businesses speed up investment in machinery and computer equipment. The Conference Board reported yesterday that its closely watched index of US consumer confidence rose strongly again this month to 80.2, from a revised 71.9 in November, giving a rise of 20 points in two months. Only the Pacific and middle Atlantic regions still show lower levels of confidence than a year ago, and both have shown some recovery in optimism in the past two months. The December survey marked the sixth consecutive month in which consumers' assessment of their situation had improved, although the biggest rise came in future expectations. Reports from credit card companies show that consumers have been taking their new-found confidence shopping, with Mastercard seeing credit card sales up 24 per cent in the pre-Christmas period this year, and Visa experiencing 32 per cent growth. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department's sector-by-sector review of US industry predicts a median growth rate of 2.8 per cent in manufacturers' shipments next year, spurred by increased consumer purchases and business investment in capital equipment. The rise is led by the sale of 14.8m cars and light trucks, a solid 6 per cent increase from this year, and by the construction of 1.3m new homes, a 4 per cent gain from 1993. Shipments of household appliances are expected to grow by 3.6 per cent. Mr Jeffrey Garten, undersecretary of commerce, said the anticipated strength of car sales was 'extremely good news not just for the auto industry but for the entire economy'. The fastest growing industrial sectors in the Commerce Department's annual review both benefit from the strong car industry: metal cutting machinery, whose sales are projected to grow by 12.8 per cent, and electronic components, where an 11.1 per cent advance is expected. The weakest sectors are expected to be defence-related industries such as aircraft parts, navigational equipment and shipbuilding. The department predicts a decline in venture capital, and expects savings institutions to lose some of their share of the mortgage market to other lenders. The banking sector is expected to be profitable for the third consecutive year. US raps Japan over chip trade, Page 2 Clinton - Year One, Page 11</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Safer pensions THE DEADLINE passed yesterday for submissions to the Goode committee on pensions law reform, after the publication of a consultative paper in September. The committee is due to publish its findings by next June. That part of the evidence which has been published reveals plenty of diverse viewpoints, but also signs of a consensus that the security of pension scheme assets and benefits must be greatly improved after the Maxwell disaster and a series of lesser, but in themselves just as disturbing, scandals. One of the more thoughtful papers has come from the Confederation of British Industry. Private-sector schemes did, in fact, peak in terms of employee membership as long ago as 1967 at 8.1m and now cover well under 6m people, against perhaps 5m in public-sector schemes. However, there are still 460,000 private-sector schemes with assets of Pounds 320bn. The decline in private-sector coverage raises the fundamental question of what occupational schemes are there for. They were originally designed to attract workers and reward long service. These days, however, lifetime service with the same employer is unusual and pension schemes are often used to finance early retirement and redundancy packages. The CBI emphasises that schemes will need to be much more flexible in future. But this could make scheme membership less attractive to employees. For this reason, it would be a pity if the Goode committee were to confine itself to narrow questions of fraud and mismanagement. There seems to be a fairly general acceptance that some sort of compensation scheme should be introduced, but not many of those organisations which have sent in submissions are ready to accept that comprehensive protection should be put in place. True, the National Association of Pension Funds has taken a strongly positive line, but has been strongly criticised for its pains by some of its big member schemes. The CBI, too, believes that compensation should be provided only in clear cases of fraud, but not of maladministration or investment losses. Yet it is not clear that it will be practical to draw fine distinctions or wait years for proof of fraud where members' expectations have been disappointed. Companies that wish to provide occupational schemes for their workers will have to pay the price of extensive regulation and protection, just as do the investment institutions that sell normal savings products. Inevitably the imposition of minimum funding standards and external trustees would seriously cramp the style of the traditional company scheme, and would raise questions about the balance between schemes with a final salary link and those with a money purchase structure where more of the investment risk falls upon the member. If the Committee's recommendations turn out to have momentous implications for company pensions that will be no reason for pulling punches.</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Yugoslav army to withdraw from key area THE presidents of Croatia and the rump state of Yugoslavia announced yesterday the Yugoslav army would pull out of the strategic Prevlaka peninsula, which it has occupied for many months, by October 20. Mr Franjo Tudjman and Mr Dobrica Cosic also agreed their largely hostile states would work towards mutual recognition. The text of an eight-point document was read to journalists by international mediator Mr Cyrus Vance as the two presidents - whose forces waged a bloody war last year - stood alongside. At the same time Lord Owen, with Mr Vance co-chairman of the Geneva conference on former Yugoslavia, announced that the warring sides in Bosnia had agreed to talks on demilitarising the republic's beleaguered capital, Sarajevo. In their declaration, hammered out during a day of discussion chaired by Mr Vance and Mr Owen, the Croatian and Yugoslav presidents also promised to work for a 'just, peaceful solution' of the Bosnian conflict. They condemned the practice of 'ethnic cleansing' or driving other ethnic groups from their homes. They further agreed to co-operate in ensuring people forced out of Serb-controlled areas of Croatia could return to their homes. Thousands of Croat refugees have been threatening to march back into 'Sector East' of eastern Croatia where Serbs have set up a mini-state. United Nations officer in Osijek yesterday averted just such a march by some 1,000 men and women refugees to return to their homes in Baranja abandoned last autumn. Colonel Viktor Loginov, a UN officer, on a road just south of Osijek, warned the crowd to wait for the UN to let them return home. UN officials had feared the march would have led to violence and could have jeopardised the UN peace plan which has created four protected areas in Croatia.</p>

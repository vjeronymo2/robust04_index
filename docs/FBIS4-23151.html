			<p>BFN     [Text] Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has said his  political opponents are being manipulated by whites in the  country, who are once more resorting to racial arguments on the  eve of elections in Zimbabwe. Speaking before Zimbabwe African  National Union members, Mugabe said one of the examples of these  politicians is Enoch Dumbutshena, the leader of Zimbabwe  Movement of Unity and former chairman of the Supreme Court.  Mugabe has been accusing the country's whites of racism for  resisting the government's plans of acquiring agricultural land  and distributing them to black farmers. Whites say the  government is using the agricultural issue to restore its  popularity before the elections.</p>

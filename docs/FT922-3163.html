			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / The Earth Summit: Tear gas disrupts Bush speech in Panama President George Bush, his eyes watering, was forced to flee a crowded city square yesterday when riot police fired tear gas to break up a protest against his 1989 invasion of Panama, Reuter reports from Panama City. Pandemonium broke out at Plaza Porras, forcing Mr Bush and his wife Barbara to flee to the safety of their limousine as security men, crouched and weapons drawn, guarded their exit. Mr Bush had been scheduled to deliver a speech saluting Panama's return to democracy in his first visit to the country since US troops invaded in December 1989 and toppled strongman Manuel Noriega. Several hundred demonstrators, kept a block away from the square by a line of riot police, hurled rocks and bottles. Riot police responded quickly by firing tear gas canisters but the wind blew fumes over the crowd of several thousand. Panicked, they surged towards the platform, apparently to escape the noxious fumes. The gas wafted over the platform where the Bushes and Panamanian President Guillermo Endara were seated. US officials said Mr Bush did not suffer injury. He was later seen with reddened, swollen eyes. Mr Bush had stopped in Panama for a four-hour visit and later left for the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.</p>

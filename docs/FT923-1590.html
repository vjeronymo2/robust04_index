			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia faces Dollars 6.6bn bill to update aluminium smelters ABOUT USDollars 6.6bn was needed to update Russia's four biggest aluminium smelters, Mr Horst Peters, general manager, technology marketing, for VAW Aluminium, said yesterday. He suggested that a better use for the cash would be the construction of three new smelters with a capacity of 400,000 tonnes each. Mr Peters said Russia's aluminium fabricating industry also required substantial capital to convert defence-oriented plants to the production of consumer products such as aluminium for cans and packaging materials. At least one new hot mill was necessary with a capacity of 700,000 tonnes which would cost Dollars 500m. About the same amount of capital was required for other downstream aluminium projects. 'But who is prepared to spend substantial amounts of money for the Russian aluminium industry?' asked Mr Peters. He said it was unlikely that foreign governments would place a high priority on investment in the Russian aluminium industry. But the western aluminium industry could perhaps help by transfering technology to modernise smelters and fabricating plants, and developing joint projects in line with western standards. In a paper for Metal Bulletin's aluminium conference in Oslo, Mr Peters said the Russian aluminium industry's main asset was the 25,000 megawatts of power generated by hydro electric projects in the Yennisei area of Siberia. The 14 aluminium smelters in the Commonwealth of Independent States had a total annual capacity of about 3.8m tonnes but they were 'physically outdated - using old technologies with unattractive technical parameters'. The smelters were not able to meet existing Russian pollution standards and if environmental laws were enforced 'nearly all the smelters in Russia would have to be closed or have to substantially reduce production'. Mr Peters said that, even if three new aluminium smelters were built in Russia, alumina, an essential raw material, would have to be transported from the Japanese Sea, adding up to Dollars 300 a tonne to the cost of aluminium production. This would have to be offset by 'nearly zero charges for electricity'. The CIS's ten alumina plants had a combined annual capacity of 5.25m tonnes but were using processes which pushed production costs up to 100 to 260 per cent above those in Western Australia, the lowest-cost producer.  -------------------------------------------            CIS ALUMINIUM SMELTERS  ------------------------------------------- Location           Capacity         Type                      (tpy)  ------------------------------------------- RUSSIA  ------------------------------------------- Volkhov             20,000            Pb Nadvoitsy           60,000             S Kandalaksha         60,000             S Volgograd          250,000             S Kamensk Uralski    110,000             S Bogoslovsk         150,000             S Novokuznetsk       280,000             S Sayansk            320,000            Pb Krasnoyarsk        800,000             S Bratsk             850,000             S Irkutsk            280,000             S Ukraine Zaporozhe   70,000             S  ------------------------------------------- AZERBAIJAN  ------------------------------------------- Sumgait 60,000 S  ------------------------------------------- TADZHIKISTAN  ------------------------------------------- Regar 520,000 Pb  ------------------------------------------- Source: VAWPb = pre-bake S = Soederberg  -------------------------------------------</p>

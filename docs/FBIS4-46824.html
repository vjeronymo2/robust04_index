			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V.L. Perlamutrov, corresponding member of </F> Russian Academy of Economic Sciences, doctor of economic  sciences, professor, and deputy director of the Market Problems  Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences: "Reforming the  Central Bank: Financial-Economic and Political Aspects"]    [Text] A message from the president of the Russian  Federation spoke of the need for reformation of the Central Bank  of Russia, the ultimate aim of which was the creation of a  federal reserve system. How do the reformers envisage the  Central Bank? For the time being it is not clear--there is no  precisely formulated concept. One thing is clear--the process of  reform will be under the president's control. In an interview by  our newspaper (BIZNES I BANKI No 17, 1994), F.Ya. Livshits,  director of a presidential group of experts, called upon the  Central Bank of Russia, scholars, and bankers to express their  opinion on the subject of their vision of a new banking system  for our country. Before posing the problem of converting the  Central Bank of Russia to a federal reserve system, however, the  status and authority of the Federation's constituents should  obviously be determined. This opinion was expressed by those  participating in an applied science seminar (Moscow, 14 April  this year) at which a number of problems related to reforming  Russian banking systems were discussed. It was organized by the  Market Problems Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences,  the Energiya Association of Independent Commercial Banks, and  the newspaper BIZNES I BANKI. We offer for our readers'  attention the speeches of the seminar participants.    We have just heard the ideas of F.Ya. Livshits, doctor of  economic science. I have the impression that these are not the  thoughts of a financier, or a loan officer, or a money  specialist, but of an economist in general. The question right  now is really not whether the president does or does not need to  issue a document on organizing financial-industrial groups--this  is a matter for a different level of managing the economy. It is  a question of something quite different, above all, of the  processes in the entire financial-economic sphere. The main  thing is that, after all, we are not simply bringing about a  reform, we are in a profound economic crisis. Industrial  production has dropped by 60 percent, agricultural--by  one-third, and putting new production funds into  operation--almost 100-fold. This is not simply an economic  crisis, it is the collapse of the country's economy. Even the  crisis in the American economy at the beginning of the 1930's  was a lesser one. Now they tell us that a "constriction" of  Russian industry has taken place. The Russian language is a  splendid language, and one can find many synonyms for any  concept, but the word "constriction" in no way corresponds to  the concept "crash."    As a result of Gaydar's reforms, the Russian economy has  arrived at a state in which it soon may not need any banking  system at all. It will either function in a regime like the  economy of "militant communism," when it has no need at all for  either a banking or a monetary system, but needs a Gosplan,  Gossnab, etc., or it will arrive at a state of utter chaos.    There has never been a situation in the 20th century when in  peacetime, in an industrially developed country, production has  dropped on such a scale. In the report which we heard from the  director of the group of experts affiliated with the Russian  Federation president, however, he speaks, in such calm academic  tones, about converting the Central Bank of Russia to a federal  reserve system of the type that exists in the United States.  Generally speaking, this sort of structure for central banks is  characteristic of large countries--the United States, Germany,  India. This is possible, however, when the situation in the  national economy is more or less stable. It is highly doubtful  that, with a general crisis in the national economy, the problem  of reorganizing the central bank into a federal reserve system  should appear as top-priority.    Many regional organs of authority are actively coming out in  favor of reorganizing the Central Bank of Russia into a federal  system. They picture each oblast or autonomous republic as now  becoming a competent member of the federal system. But why? In  those same United States there are 15 banking districts, when  there are 50 states. In general, it is not compulsory, or even  necessary, for the administrative boundaries of territorial  formations to coincide with the boundaries of the banking  districts. It is much more logical for these latter to coincide  with the boundaries of the economic regions of a country, such  as the Center of Russia, the Northwest, the Central Chernozem  area, the Urals, West Siberia, etc.    No reforms in Russia will be successful if we reject, from  the very start, the experience of other countries that have  undergone huge critical shocks and have found a way out of them.  At the beginning of the 1930's a monstrous economic crisis shook  the United States. Industrial production dropped by 48 percent,  one-third of the farmers and 5,000 commercial banks were ruined,  and the nation's unemployed numbered about 14 million. F.  Roosevelt, who had become president of the country, put a series  of anticrisis laws through congress in the early days of his  presidency. The first of them was the "Emergency Law on Banks."  The houses of congress passed it in one day and the president  signed it, that is, it went into force, in the evening. The  status of commercial and investment banks was separated, which  could not prevent mass speculation by the commercial banks in  "short money" (which is widespread in Russia right now), but  stimulated capital investments, which can only be the basis for  an upsurge in the national economy. Unless there is an increase  in capital investments in spheres such as agriculture, power  engineering, machine-building, and light, food, and  pharmaceutical industry, no monetary, customs, price, or state  budgetary measures will provide a positive return for the  national economy.    The experience of developing European and other countries  after the second world war is extremely helpful to us right now.  The regeneration of the economy, after the military collapse, on  normal market bases, following the rigid state control of  enterprises is very instructive. Once again, the main factor was  the organization of investments, not the conversion of a unitary  central bank into a federal reserve system or vice-versa. For  example, Japan got out of the postwar economic crisis along two  main channels. In the first place, the enterprises existing  mainly through the treasury, in the course of approximately 10  years after 1945 converted to commercial bases, to  self-financing, and moreover they were divided up, merged,  modernized, respecialized, etc., preparing for market conditions  of operation. In the second place, the law established that  commercial banks were obligated to transfer a quota of their  liabilities "to the custody" of a central investment bank. This  created a source of investment for regeneration and structural  and technological reorganization of the country's economy. The  results of these measures were manifested in the postwar  augmented growth and improvement in the country's national  economy in 1970-1990.    One more point--the interrelations between the central bank  and the commercial banks. While up to the middle of our century,  the Ministry of Finance and the treasury were the main monetary  center for the state everywhere, since gold or primarily gold  working capital were emitted, now the central banks come forth  as this center. The country's central banks have essentially  become the dictator of its monetary economy and relations with  other countries. In our country the laws in force on the Central  Bank and on commercial banks grant the latter more rights than  is accepted in other industrial countries. This is one of the  reasons why the economy has been brought to an increasingly  chaotic state. For example, the Central Bank cannot or does not  have the right to demand from a commercial bank everything  necessary to analyze the statistics on its activity. Obviously,  a unified law on the country's banking system is needed, in  which the rights and duties of both the upper and lower levels  of this system would be unequivocally stipulated. In addition,  in a period of crisis, a third level of the banking system  should be assigned--investment banks, as was done in crisis  conditions in the United States, Japan, France, and other  countries. On the whole, during the period of crisis, Russia  needs emergency anticrisis laws, including those in the banking  sphere. As we emerge from the crisis, measures can be taken to  convert the present central banking system into a federal  reserve system. But not before that. Preliminary developments,  of course, must begin right now.</p>

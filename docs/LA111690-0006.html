			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INITIATIVES AND ABSENTEE VOTING  </P> <P> I am concerned about what I see as a possible abuse of the absentee ballot  process. In the past it has been my understanding that absentee ballots were  available as an option for those who could not get to their polling place to  vote for reasons of health, business travel or military service.  </P> <P> The impression I got in the last election was that absentee balloting was  offered as an alternative to voting at one's assigned polling place in the  event it was inconvenient or simply too much bother. This seems to be one more  case of "getting out the vote" no matter what the degree of interest or  understanding of the voter.  </P> <P> I can't believe that the country is well served by the casual involvement of  voters whose ignorance isn't even a source of concern to them.  </P> <P> DIANE SILVER  </P> <P> Arleta  </P></p>

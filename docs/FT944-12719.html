			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Emerging Markets: Global funds gap 'widening' The gap between the best and worst performing global emerging markets funds is growing wider, according to a review by Fund Research. The report found that the best global emerging markets fund increased by 67.2 per cent, while the worst rose by only 6.2 per cent over the 12 months to August 1. Mr Peter Jeffreys, managing director of Fund Research, an independent research company on international open-end and closed-end funds, said the review also identified a widening gap between fund management groups in terms of the quantity and quality of resources dedicated to emerging markets. The report covered 50 of the sector's 120 funds, drawn from a group of US, UK and offshore open and closed end funds. Fund Research, 1 Frederick's Place, London, EC2R 8HX</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Obren Zerajic from Cajnice] </F>   [Text] Fighting continues today in the area between Gorazde  and Cajnice. The command of the Herzegovina Corps stresses that  the units of the Srpska army are successfully carrying out their  duties with the aim of enabling the expelled Serbian population  from the right bank of the Drina River to return home and to  save around 1,000 Serbs trapped in Gorazde itself. In fighting  yesterday and overnight, the troops of the Herzegovina Corps  have captured two important peaks -- Gradina and Jartiste,  located some five kilometers east of Gorazde. These are the  positions from which all Muslim attacks toward Cajnice were  launched in the past 18 days. NATO planes are today again  overflying the positions of the Serb troops between Gorazde and  Cajnice. True, they are flying at an altitude over three  kilometers, but an air raid alarm has been in effect in Cajnice  since yesterday. The local population is observing the alarm.  There have been no losses in the ranks of the Herzegovina Corps  in the past 24 hours.</p>

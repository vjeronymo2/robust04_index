			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A whopping venture - Burger King has moved into Japan Five years ago Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, the head of a Japanese railway and leisure group who regularly tops lists of the world's richest people, ate his first Burger King Whopper in the US. The experience was so overwhelming that he immediately set himself the goal of bringing the fast-food restaurant chain to Japan. Tsutsumi's dream became a reality in September when Burger King, a subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan of the UK, opened its first restaurant just outside Tokyo. The deal was agreed in just five minutes last November when Tsutsumi met James Adamson, chief executive officer of Burger King, for the first time. However, Burger King's move into the Y400bn (Pounds 2.5bn) Japanese hamburger market comes as competition has intensified and leading fast-food chains are feeling the effects of the prolonged economic downturn. Japan's hamburger market is dominated by McDonald's and two Japanese chains, MosBurger and Lotteria. The fast-food outlets, with the exception of MosBurger which has succeeded with its Japanese-style burgers, are facing increasing competition from pizza deliveries, sandwich shops and convenience store chains. Even McDonald's, which opened its first store 20 years ago, is facing lower profit margins. The company's sales for the business year to December last year grew a mere 2.4 per cent, the smallest rise since the company was established in in Japan. Operating profits fell 20 per cent. Samuel Yong, managing director of Burger King Asia Pacific in Singapore, says the company could not enter Japan earlier due to the lack of the right partner. Yong hired consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand to come up with a strategy for Japan. They eventually concluded that the market had an opening for the American flame-broiled Whopper burger. But Japan's high real-estate costs meant Burger King needed a business partner with extensive real-estate holdings. Tsutsumi, who runs the Seibu Railway network, as well as theme parks, ski resorts and a baseball dome, seemed an ideal partner. However, with the venture being Seibu's first move into the food-service industry and Burger King's first step into Japan, both sides felt it was better to sign a co-operation agreement without spelling out long-term plans. Seibu supplies the real estate and operates the outlets; Burger King provides the know-how and cooking appliances. The partners agreed to halve the profits for the time being. 'We want to let the relationship evolve as it goes,' explains Yong. 'We want to make sure that our business is acceptable to the Japanese and the restaurant operating economics are right.' Yong says Burger King aims to keep its restaurants smaller than competitors  -at about 1,000sq ft, a fifth of an average Burger King store in the US - and to offer a simple menu with only nine items. The company hopes to avoid the problems encountered by McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken, which have diversified and changed menus so rapidly that customers and even employees could not keep up. Masao Okada, head of Seibu's Burger King project team, says an increasing number of Japanese are going overseas and tasting the Whopper. He expects to open as many as 300 outlets over the next few years in Seibu's railway stations and leisure facilities. Analysts say much will depend on how far Burger King can expand in the residential areas of Kanagawa, south of Tokyo, and Chiba, to the east, where Seibu's railway network or entertainment facilities do not exist. In spite of this scepticism, average daily sales for the first store totalled Y1m during the initial few weeks of opening. The figure, one of the highest sales per square foot among Burger King's worldwide network, was achieved with the help of Tsutsumi eating a Whopper in front of television news crews on the opening day.</p>

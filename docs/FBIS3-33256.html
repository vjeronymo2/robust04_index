			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 20 Feb (DPA) -- In statements  made today, Argentine President Carlos Menem said in Cartagena  de Indias -- where he is on a private visit -- that Cuba might  rejoin the OAS if it becomes democratic. Menem referred to the  subject when he was asked about the possibility that this might  be one of the objectives of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria in  case he is elected OAS secretary general because of the role he  has played during the past year with regard to the Cuban  Government making democratic changes.    "It might be," said the Argentine president who is known for  his hard stand with regard to the Fidel Castro regime.  Nonetheless, he added that Cuba's reentry can only take place  when democracy prevails on the island. The visitor added that  "no one likes to see a country excluded," but he insisted that  Castro has been in power for 35 years and it is necessary to  make some changes now, as has happened in other nations of the  area that had long periods of dictatorships.    The Argentine president arrived on Friday in Cartagena de  Indias and tomorrow will begin a two-day official visit in Santa  Fe de Bogota. He also said that Gaviria has the capacity to be  OAS secretary general, but he commented that his victory depends  on how much support the other candidate, Costa Rican Foreign  Minister Bernd Niehaus, has for the post. Menem added that his  Colombian counterpart has the virtues for becoming a good  secretary general of the multilateral organization because "he  is a qualified, good, and resourceful man and he has carried out  a very good administration in Colombia."    Meanwhile, in statements published today in the daily EL  TIEMPO, Menem defended his economic model and said that due to  the results, people are starting to talk about the "Argentine  miracle." Menem explained that the model is based on a people's  market economy that is accompanied by a strong policy of social  solidarity. "We are absolutely convinced that this model is the  only one that allows us to take up once again the path of growth  and higher standards of living for the entire population," he  said.    As the main achievements of his government, Menem pointed  out  the elimination of inflation, monetary stability, elimination of  the budget deficit, the privatization of several enterprises,  renegotiation of the foreign debt, and a drastic reduction of  tax evasion.    While in Cartagena de Indias, the Argentine president has  been visiting tourist spots and playing tennis and golf with  Gaviria, with whom he will travel tomorrow to Santa Fe de Bogota  to begin an official visit. It was learned that Menem and  Gaviria will sign important agreements, one on judicial  cooperation matters in the struggle against narcotics  trafficking and terrorism and another one that regulates animal  sanitation measures in order to increase trade in agriculture  and livestock.    Menem is scheduled to arrive in Santa Fe de Bogota at 1100  at  a military airport where he will be received by Foreign Minister  Noemi Sanin. In the afternoon the two presidents will meet at  the House of Narino (government palace). Later on, Menem will  speak with leaders of Congress and leaders of the Argentine  community residing in Colombia, while on Tuesday he will have  breakfast with Colombian businessmen, unveil a monument in  memory of Eva Peron, and sign agreements with Gaviria.</p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWPORT BEACH NOIR;  </P> <P> THE HORSE LATITUDES BY ROBERT FERRIGNO (WILLIAM MORROW: $18.95; 288 PP.;  0-688-09060-5)  </P> <P> The jacket blurb for "The Horse Latitudes" by Robert Ferrigno, a newspaper  feature writer, tells us that the book "brilliantly subsumes the conventions of  noir literature." And from the beginning, it's true, there's no mistaking the  mood indigo of Danny DiMedici, a retired dope dealer who pines for his ex-wife,  Lauren Keil: "There were nights when Danny missed Lauren so bad that he wanted  to take a fat man and throw him through a plate-glass window."  </P> <P> Lauren, brainy as well as beautiful, is still out in the fast lane leading  cutting-edge seminars for executives and scientists while Danny idles in a  rented apartment in Newport Beach with a phony fireplace. Having had to kill a  man, he's lost his appetite for dealing. But don't be fooled, he still has the  moves.  </P> <P> When a dealer pal asks him to keep a Samoan bodyguard occupied, he stops just  short of killing the guy. It's a good fight scene, both of them slipping on the  oil that happens to be on the pavement beside the Samoan's car. Later, Danny  notices his foot hurts from kicking the man and reflects that he's getting too  old for this kind of work.  </P> <P> There's been a murder. A scientist involved in genetic experiments that employ  fresh human fetuses has been discovered strung up and maimed in Lauren's  stylish, blood-spattered beach house, and Lauren can't be found. There are a  lot of subsidiary characters, including twin body builders named Boyd and  Lloyd, both of them murderous morons. And there's an old detective near  retirement named Steiner who comes close to walking away with the book.  </P> <P> Ferrigno is a skillful writer, good with dialogue, who occasionally skimps in  setting a scene so the reader experiences a sort of prose jump-out. But the  real problem with "The Horse Latitudes" is that Danny isn't revealed deeply  enough to provide a narrative center of gravity. This is rather a designer noir  novel where the bodies and the clothes, the cars and the food, the sex and the  dope, the fine furniture and all the fancy talk stand in for the pleasures of a  story that actively plumbs its depths.  </P> <P> Sometimes the trouble seems to be that Ferrigno's journalistic instincts  undercut those of the novelist in him. For example, as he tracks the thoughts  of Det. Steiner's female partner, Jane Holt, we learn that "Newport Beach was  affluent, educated and white, a quiet, button-down community with three Ferrari  dealerships and no public transportation. The supermarkets stocked Black Forest  truffles and Dom Perignon, and commodities fraud was more common than murder .  . . " -- which is straight reportage in the guise of a character's thought  process.  </P> <P> Or consider that late in the book Danny visits a local cafe, and we learn more  about the life of its proprietor, Grace, than we know about virtually any other  character -- and she doesn't appear again. We never find out where Danny comes  from, who his parents are or where he was educated. The book is all  high-resolution front-story, and any back-story remains opaque. The scenes  unfold like animate panels in a hip comic-strip. There's no depth of field.  </P> <P> For this reason, perhaps, "The Horse Latitudes" doesn't have much narrative  momentum. Much of the action takes place off-stage. With all the elements in  place for a high-tech thriller, the book dissolves into an oddly desultory  Southern California travelogue cum character study with the moments of intimacy  few and far between. Danny regrets his murder, yearns for Lauren and moves from  scene to scene, from person to person, with a querulous aplomb that seems to  lie on top of a couple of burning questions that never get asked.  </P> <P> Late in the book, Danny and Lauren briefly discuss the loss of one's moral  compass while on drugs. Lauren tells him: "Because of the drugs, I was  exploring a different moral and logical universe. . . . " Danny has his own  memory of "a shimmy of right and wrong, good and bad. In that room, on that  morning, it . . . made sense."  </P> <P> It seems a shame Ferrigno didn't pull out all his stops and try to fully render  the moral valences implicit in such a moment. His skill indicates that he might  have brought it off, and it's exactly what this book needs: a highly charged  novelistic epiphany involving moment-to-moment psychology and perception; who  as opposed to all the insistent what.  </P> <P>  Then too, the experience of temporary alchemy with irreversible consequences  might just be the real noir behind this book's high black gloss.  </P></p>

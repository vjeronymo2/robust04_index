An offensive, which has included restructuring,  sales channel reorganization, the introduction of new cars,  etc., is beginning to bear fruit.    The full-fledged offensive of import cars has begun. The  domestic new car market between January and August dropped off  8.3 percent compared to the same period of the previous year.  However, imported cars have increased by as much as 12.4 percent.    The biggest reason for this significant growth is the import  of cars produced abroad by domestic manufacturers or, put  another way, the increase of reverse import cars. According to  results from January through August, these have expanded by  27,826 units--more than double the amount compared to the same  term of the previous year. Contributing to this is the start of  imports of models such as Toyota's Scepter wagon, Honda's Civic  coupe, Mitsubishi's Diamante wagon, etc., that had not been  imported into Japan before.    However, imports of the so-called gaisha [foreign cars]  (true  imports), which exclude the reverse importation cars, are also  steadily increasing. According to the results from January to  August, these have increased by 0.2 percent compared to the same  term of the previous year, reaching 104,593 units.    Contributing to this is the fact that, since about last  year,  several true import carmakers have begun to put some strenuous  efforts in capturing the Japanese market. Behind that is the  fact that Yanase abandoned import sales of Volkswagens at the  end of last year, and beginning this year tried selling the Opal.    Volkswagen Audi Nippon (VAN), in the middle of 1990 tried to  construct a sales system of 100,000 units per year, but  opposition was generated between it and Yanase, who wanted to  sell Volkswagen as a rare luxury car, and in the end, Yanase  quit selling VW's. This move could be described as symbolic in  Japan's import car market. Foreign automobile makers are no  longer trying to sell cars in Japan as though foreign cars are  equivalent to luxury cars but are trying to sell many cars while  standing on the same playing field as the domestic makers.    Says Rover Japan President Peter J. Woods, "When I found out  that Yanase was going to abandon sales of VW, I thought that  Japan's import car market map would change significantly. I  immediately reported to my home country (England) and drew up  various countermeasure strategies on the aspects of product and  price."    On the price front, it implemented a "fair play policy" in  February of this year which is what it calls restoration of  profits due to the strong yen difference. It lowered vehicle  prices targeting three models, such as the "Rover Mini series"  on the weighted average of 13 percent. It has successively  introduced a total of seven new models such as the automatic  Discovery, the Rover 200/400 series, among others. At the end of  1992, its sales bases were transformed to become 100 percent  dedicated sales. Forbidding parallel sales with other cars like  Peugeot and Renault, it aimed to strengthen sales capacity at  each base. By the combination of these effects it has recorded a  35.5-percent increase over the 8,793 units of the same term of  the previous year in its results from January through August.    In the future as well, "We plan to introduce new models  during the period from 1994 to the beginning of 1995. Since the  `fair play policy' was considered with a five- to six-year  interim period, I believe that people will feel that models  introduced in the future will be quite inexpensive," says Mr.  Woods. Further, beginning in November, the Discovery RV will  begin to be sold at Honda Motor dealerships under the name of  Crossroad. It is cooperation that would not be possible without  Honda Motor, which is investing 20 percent in Rover itself.    Until now the strength of the Germans with VW, Mercedes  Benz,  and BMW has been overwhelming in Japan's import car market. In  1992, they held 60 percent of the import car market. However,  going into 1993, the share of the German side dropped to 48  percent. As mentioned above, VW lost its major dealership of  Yanase, and in January to August suffered a reduction of 41.5  percent compared to the same term of the previous year. Further,  due to the domestic sales slump, sales of the luxury cars  Mercedes and BMW dropped 9.1 percent and 11.1 percent,  respectively.    U.S. Cars Also Finally Make Serious Bid    By contrast, the ones winning a significant increase in  share  are those on the U.S. side. Honda USA, Toyota, Chrysler, and  Ford are improving. Whereas their share had been only 18 percent  in 1992, it has reached 30 percent in 1993.    Of the foreign-owned makers, Chrysler had a dramatic  3.2-fold  increase compared to the same term of the previous year. That  company's recovery in the United States is also remarkable and  it has clearly become stronger in the Japanese market as well.  Its import sales arm, Chrysler Japan Sales, which should be able  to turn its balance sheet from continuously red to black ink by  1996, began to embark on various measures last year.    First, the company's structure was rationalized. Its  employees, which numbered 107 in April 1992, were reduced to 30,  less than one-third, by September 1993. Then it quit investing  in directly managed dealers, directly managed plants and PDI  (predelivery improvement) centers. It had Seibu Automotive Sales  take on all the directly managed dealerships, of which there  were 48, and at the same time, by increasing the amount handled  by Honda Motor, the number of sales bases was increased from  1,000 at the beginning of 1992 to just over 1,800. Furthermore,  100 percent of PDI, which was being performed at three  locations, was concentrated at the Honda Motor Co. Tochigi plant.    It is performing strategic pricing and the introduction of  new models very enthusiastically. The Jeep Cherokee, which it  had been selling at 5.35 million yen until last year, was  reduced in January 1993 to 3.72 million yen--a discount of as  much as 1.62 million yen. "Until 1992, U.S.-specification cars  had been brought over and headlights, turn signals, fenders,  emissions sensors, etc., were being replaced. Starting with 1993  models, it began mass production of cars for export with  English, Australian, and Japanese specifications which had  steering wheels on the right-hand side, so about all that was  necessary to do in Japan was to put on the Japanese seals,"  according to Osamu Nagata, business planning department manager  at Chrysler Japan Sales. It was possible to achieve a large cost  reduction by changing the complex manual operations that were  being done in Japan to mass production at its U.S. plant.    Moreover, he says, "We want to reduce the difference in  price  between domestic and foreign products. We want to compete at a  price that compares favorable even with other domestically  produced RV's," indicating a that there was also a strategic  motive. And then, this price was determined "at the end of 1992,  calculated at 110 yen to the dollar," says Mr. Nakata.    In addition to this, the fact that three types of the new  models of Grand Cherokee were introduced beginning in January  has also led to increased sales. Also in the future, says Mr.  Nagata, "we will soon begin sales of the 3.5 liter displacement  Vision (commonly called the LH)." Further, it is thought that in  the United States the low-priced compact car Neon dubbed the  Japanese car killer will be introduced in 1995.    Ford's move to increase its strength in Japan is also  vigorous. It is showing a 53.9-percent rise in the period from  January to August. Contributing to this is the elevation of its  power by expanding its personnel at Ford Japan which is in  charge of import sales. In the year and a half since the  beginning of last year, it added between 70 and 80 employees so  that now there are about 110. And, says Ford Japan Advertising  Liaison Headquarters Manager Hiroaki Tanabe, "We have taken a  policy since 1991 of gradually bringing costs and follow-up  service to be on a par with domestically produced cars." Prices  are revised in autumn of each year and it is common for them to  rise, but Ford has lowered prices in both 1991 and 1992. The 3.8  liter Taurus wagon, which was 4.15 million yen in 1990, was  reduced to 3.986 million yen in 1991 and 3.78 million yen in  1992.    Furthermore, since dealers had been conducting direct import  sales, the Explorer RV that had been selling at 5.25 million yen  was switched to Ford Japan importation, and the price was  reduced by 1.26 million yen to 3.99 million yen.    Also, in April 1993, it built a parts depot (parts center).  Until now, most parts had to be gotten from the United States,  but this has made it possible to execute more prompt follow-up  service.    "In the first half of 1994, we are planning introduction of  right-hand side steering wheels on the Probe, Mondeo, and the  three Mustang models. Further we will introduce right-hand side  steering wheels on the Taurus and the Explorer by 1997," says  Mr. Tanabe.    The bulky GM is also beginning to stir. In its results from  January to August, it was the only one among the Big Three to  have a decrease, off by 12.4 percent. Much of this is due to a  delay of four to five months more than expected in the receipt  of the Chevrolet Camaro, which had undergone a full model  change. Registration of the Camaro began in August, and has  expanded greatly at a 46.8-percent increase over the same month  of the previous year.    According to Michael Dougherty, president of Japan GM, "We  will not launch a campaign of restoration of the profits from  the high yen difference, but when one considers the future  trends, there is no doubt that prices will end up dropping." It  also plans to introduce a new Cadillac.    Moreover, concerning the Saturn, which has been a big hit in  the United States, he says, "Currently, GM's Saturn project team  has come over and is studying the Japanese market. We are  examining the idea of establishing a Saturn channel for sales as  was done in the United States. We want to introduce a right-hand  drive car at about the same price as other domestically made  cars in the mid-1990's."    The full-fledged offensive of the true import cars is  building up steam with the passing of each day. As Japan GM  President Dougherty points out, "It is inappropriate for the  original import car share into Japan to be merely 4 percent,"  and, indeed, the share of import cars into Japan's market is  extremely low compared to Europe and the United States. He adds,  "It is exceedingly difficult to build a dealer network in Japan  because of keiretsu, etc.    "Moreover, when introducing products, one had to go through  the Ministry of Transport, which took time and effort, and we  were not able to achieve good results. However, recently, with  the beginning of development of a Saturn with a right-hand side  steering wheel, among other things, GM itself is beginning to  turn its attention toward the Japanese market," according to Mr.  Dougherty. In Rover President Woods' view as well, "There are  also trade imbalance problems, so there will probably be a  growth of about 40 percent in true import cars in the next four  years."    For the domestic market, growth of which is said to have  ground to a halt, the threat of the import cars will prove to be  a double punch. The struggle of Japanese cars will continue for  quite some time.</p>

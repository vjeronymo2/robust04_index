			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / OECD growth rate edges up Economic growth in the 25 member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development this year is expected to be slightly higher than the 2.6 per cent increase in gross domestic product forecast in July, according to officials at the organisation. Mr Tsutomo Tanaka, vice-chairman of the OECD's economic policy committee, said OECD economic developments had been generally favourable. He declined to make a new forecast, but said growth was expected to edge up to 2.7 per cent. For 1995 and 1996, Mr Tanaka said growth would be about 3 per cent.</p>

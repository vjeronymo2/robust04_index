			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / De Benedetti vows business as normal despite sentence MR Carlo De Benedetti, the Italian industrialist, said that he would conduct business as normal, in spite of being sentenced on Thursday to six years and four months in jail for his role in the 1982 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano. Mr De Benedetti and most of the 32 other defendants yesterday announced appeals against the ruling. Although he felt 'profound bitterness' towards the judgment, Mr De Benedetti said he had not lost his 'peace of mind and desire to work'. Under Italy's complex legal system, none of the accused are likely to go to prison for some time, if at all. The appeal procedure will take months, if not years, and the case may then be referred to the supreme court. Shares in companies associated with Mr De Benedetti made up much of the ground lost after Thursday's judgments. Ordinary shares in Olivetti, the computer group controlled by his CIR holding company, closed at L2,660 (121.24p), just below Wednesday's close of L2,680, after tumbling to L2,605 on Thursday. Appearing calm and in good humour after returning from a holiday in Spain to a hastily-arranged Milan press conference, he avoided making any political accusations regarding the sentences. Many of his co-defendants have attacked the judgments as being highly politicised. Mr De Benedetti's independence from the political establishment and occasionally outspoken comments have earned him enemies in Rome over the years. Last night, however, Mr Nino Cristofori, a junior minister and close adviser to Mr Giulio Andreotti, the prime minister, expressed 'puzzlement' about the sentences on Mr De Benedetti and Mr Giuseppe Ciarrapico, a financier close to Mr Andreotti. Mr De Benedetti, who was deputy chairman of Banco Ambrosiano for just 65 days, shed some light on his relationship with Mr Roberto Calvi, the bank's chairman, who was found hanging under Blackfriars Bridge in London shortly before the bank collapsed owing Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 730m). Mr De Benedetti said Mr Calvi had indicated his intention to step down as chairman within a few months, leaving the way open for him to take the job. However, it became clear within days that Mr Calvi had changed his mind. Mr De Benedetti resigned after being told his position as deputy chairman would not be confirmed. He stressed he had consulted the governor of the Bank of Italy before taking the job, and had made clear his doubts about Ambrosiano's management on stepping down.

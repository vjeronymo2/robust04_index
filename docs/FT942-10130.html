			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Surprise fall in March industrial output The pace of industrial recovery remains relatively firm although it may have been exaggerated by government figures in the first two months of the year, production figures from the Central Statistical Office suggested yesterday. Seasonally adjusted industrial production in March fell by 0.6 per cent compared with the previous month, the CSO said. The fall took the markets by surprise after industrial production grew 0.9 per cent and 0.6 per cent in January and February respectively. Market analysts had expected March growth of about 0.2 per cent. Officials yesterday said that monthly figures were volatile and stressed that the quarterly results, regarded as a better indicator of trends, pointed to continuing economic recovery. Industrial production - which includes manufacturing and the energy and water sectors - rose by 0.7 per cent in the first quarter of this year against the previous quarter, and 3.8 per cent compared with the first quarter of last year. Manufacturing output was up 1.4 per cent in this year's first quarter against the previous quarter - the strongest quarterly growth for five years. This left the quarterly manufacturing index at its highest level for more than three years - but still 4 per cent below the all-time high recorded during the second quarter of 1990. The Treasury said the trend of manufacturing output continued firmly upwards. The CSO said it saw no reason to revise its trend estimate of 3 per cent annual growth in manufacturing output - an optimism reflected in the City. Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Saloman Brothers, said: 'This is not a slow-down. But it does tend to bring you back to a steady growth scenario rather than the 'boom, boom' headlines we had in January and February.' Some economists suggested the fall may have been due to distortions in the new trade statistics, or the fact that the Easter holidays fell partly in March this year. The CSO said the main element in the drop came from the food and electronics sectors failing to sustain their February 'spurt'. March's figures for the food and tobacco sector, for example, recorded a monthly fall because the February figure was boosted by a 50 per cent surge in sugar production. Production of computers and other electronic goods also fell back slightly after a large rise in January and February. In spite of these falls, the CSO pointed out that the investment goods sector - which includes electronics manufacturing - recorded a strong 4.1 per cent growth over the quarter. Other branches of engineering grew strongly, with a 4.5 per cent rise in the machinery and equipment sector and a 4.7 per cent rise in rubber and plastics. These rises were counterbalanced by a 1.5 per cent drop in quarterly car production and flat results from other consumer sectors.</p>

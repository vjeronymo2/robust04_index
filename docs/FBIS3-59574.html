As early as last October it  was agreed that ZMD was to be removed from the parent company  Mikroelektronic and Technologiegesellschaft (MTG) and taken over  by the holding companies of the Commerzbank AG, Frankfurt/M.,  and the Dresdner Bank AG, Frankfurt/M., each taking half. The  privatization is under committee supervision.    For Saxony's economic minister, Kajo Schommer (CDU), this  sale marks an important technological policy goal for the Land:  "Saxony will remain a standard in microelectronics in the  production of user-specific circuits." In Saxony about 100,000  jobs depend directly or indirectly on microelectronics, Schommer  said. East Germany's other two significant microelectronics  firms in Erfurt and Frankfurt/O. have already been privatized by  their trusteeship.    The support for this project is considerable: According to  statements of the trustees, Siemens AG will provide knowhow and  personnel in areas of technology, production techniques,  marketing and sales for three years. There is a fairly good  chance that ZMD could develop as a supplier for Siemens, not  least through licenses which Siemens will make available.    The Free State will provide the liquidator for MTG with DM40  million for research and development for ZMD and an additional  DM10 million until 1996 for the purchase of property and  buildings. The trusteeship will support the undertaking for the  next three years with opening financing in the amount of DM135  million. Schommer thought that it would be clear in 1995 that  faith in ZMD had been justified.    There is still quite a bit to be done: Last year ZMD  achieved  sales of DM7 million. According to the designated president of  ZMD management, Kurt Garbrecht, this year sales should amount to  DM15 million, but this is not yet guaranteed. For 1994 he said  that the objective would be sales of DM50 million and in 1995  DM100 million. Costs should be covered by production by 1996.  Garbrecht, who most recently was leader of the internal  microelectronics division at Siemens, estimated financial needs  up until 1995 (loss coverage and investments) at approximately  DM130 million. MTG liquidator Wilhelm A. Schaaf confirmed that  with the support of the trusteeship, the Land of Saxony and the  EC there is complete financing for ZMD. He said that the ZMD  plan was firm.</p>

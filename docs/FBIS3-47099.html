(OANA-BERNAMA) -- The first  batch of 450 men of the Seventh Battalion of the Royal Rangers  Regiment (RARD) left here Saturday morning for a six-month tour  of duty under the United Nations Operations in Somalia (UNOSOM).    The men, in full combat gear, were seen off by Army Chief  Gen. Borhan Ahmad and other army top brass.    Their families were also at the Royal Malaysian Air Force  Base in Subang near here to bid them farewell. The  Mentakab-based rangers will form the Malaysian Battalion  (Malbatt) II in Mogadishu, relieving Malbatt I which comprises  mainly members of the mechanised 19th Royal Malay Regiment  (RAMD) based in Sungai Petani.    While the members of the 19th RAMD are returning, the  rangers  are being sent to the Horn of Africa in Batcheas from today.  The next flight on the UN-chartered civil aircraft will be on  Jan. 10.</p>

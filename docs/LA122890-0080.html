			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MWD CAN'T FACE FELONY CHARGES, JUDGE RULES;  </P> <P> POLLUTION: ONLY MISDEMEANORS CAN BE FILED AGAINST PUBLIC AGENCIES, HE SAYS. THE  CASE INVOLVED A CHEMICAL SPILL IN WHICH SIX BICYCLISTS WERE BURNED.  </P> <P> In a controversial decision, a municipal judge ruled Thursday that the  Metropolitan Water District of Southern California cannot face felony charges  for a chemical spill in Yorba Linda that inflicted second-degree burns on six  men who were bicycling in a state park last year.  </P> <P> Judge Daniel T. Brice ruled that public agencies cannot stand trial for  felonies under a major state environmental law. He added that even if they  could, there was insufficient evidence in this case to warrant the charges.  </P> <P> Instead, the judge ordered the Los Angeles-based agency to stand trial Feb. 6  on three misdemeanor counts. The agency is the world's largest water supplier,  serving 15 million Southern Californians.  </P> <P> "I believe it would be inappropriate for any public entity within the state of  California to be held on a felony," said Brice, who made his ruling after a  six-day preliminary hearing.  </P> <P> His decision was immediately disputed by top state water quality officials, who  wrote and enforce the law.  </P> <P> Andrew Sawyer, assistant chief counsel of the state Water Resources Control  Board in Sacramento said the state water code prohibits release of toxic  chemicals into waterways, and is patterned after federal law, which says any  individual, corporation or public entity can be held on criminal or civil  charges.  </P> <P> "I wrote that section of the water code and it was clearly intended to apply  wherever the federal Clean Water Act applies, including public entities," he  said when told of the ruling.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Pear also said he believes the judge's decision is  in error and he is considering an appeal.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Marshall Schulman, the MWD's defense attorney, said he will move  to have the misdemeanor charges dropped.  </P> <P> "I don't think they should be prosecuted for anything. That is the bottom  line," he said, adding that the injuries were the result of an unintentional  act.  </P> <P> State water officials said the case marks the first time in the nation that a  public or governmental agency has faced criminal charges of violating  water-pollution laws. Most cases against polluters involve civil charges.  </P> <P> Prosecutors and water quality officials allege that the MWD's Diemer Filtration  Plant in Yorba Linda illegally discharged a caustic chemical into Chino Hills  State Park when there was a pressure buildup in a pipeline.  </P> <P> From Oct. 26 through Oct. 28, 1989, at least 466 gallons of concentrated sodium  hydroxide spilled from the Diemer plant into Telegraph Creek, which runs  through the park, according to a report by the Santa Ana Regional Water Quality  Control Board.  </P> <P> The spill, undetected by the water agency for almost three days, crossed a  public bike path. Six cyclists who rode the path said they suffered blistering  burns on their legs, backs and other body parts and that their mountain bikes,  clothing and tires were pitted and burned.  </P> <P> Without felony charges, the agency faces a much lighter fine and less of a  public stigma, prosecutors and environmental officials said. The maximum fine  for each misdemeanor charge is $25,000 per day, or a total of $75,000 for the  three-day spill, Pear said. That compares with a possible $1-million fine under  a felony charge.  </P> <P> "I'm disappointed," said Bruce Paine, a senior engineer at the regional Water  Quality Control Board who investigated the case. "It's a dramatic difference in  the maximum liability. It certainly is not as strong a message as the potential  of a $1-million fine."  </P> <P> The decision calls into question whether the state's major environmental law --  the water code -- allows any public agency, whether it is a city, a sanitation  agency or the military, to be convicted of a felony if it disposes of dangerous  chemicals illegally.  </P> <P> Brice said he interprets the state law to mean that the Legislature did not  intend to hold public agencies liable for felonies, only misdemeanors.  </P> <P> But he added that much of environmental law is uncharted waters, so "I could be  absolutely wrong and counsel may want to litigate further" in a higher court.  </P> <P> Prosecutors stress that the decision was made by a lower court. Therefore, it  carries no legal precedent and is not binding to other cases. But environmental  attorneys and water quality officials worry that it might discourage  prosecutors from making similar felony prosecutions in the future.  </P></p>

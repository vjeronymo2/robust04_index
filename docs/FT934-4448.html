			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Growth in advertising boosts Metro Radio Increasing interest in radio as an advertising medium and signs of returning consumer confidence helped Metro Radio Group, the USM-quoted radio station operator, increase pre-tax profits by 27 per cent to Pounds 2.36m in the year to September 30, against Pounds 1.86m . The group operates seven independent radio stations in north-east England and Yorkshire. Advertising revenue rose by 17 per cent to Pounds 14.7m (Pounds 12.6m). Local and regional revenue was 23 per cent higher. A strong recovery in the second half resulted in a national revenue increase of 1.9 per cent. Turnover rose to Pounds 17.7m (Pounds 15.2m). Net debt dropped 38 per cent to Pounds 1.47m (Pounds 2.36m). Earnings per share rose by 25 per cent to 9.4p (7.5p) and the total dividend goes up 10 per cent to 5.5p (5p) via a final of 4p. Mr John Josephs, managing director, said the increase in advertising demand had been across the board,but growth areas had been motor manufacturers and dealers and retailers of furniture and white goods. The arrival in the marketplace of Classic FM and Virgin had raised radio advertising's profile, he said.

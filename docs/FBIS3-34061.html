This is when  warring groups in Afghanistan have also agreed to set Jalalabad  as a secure area. Here is our colleague, Khameneh, in Pakistan  with a report:    [Khameneh] The leaders of the warring groups in Kabul have  agreed to declare Jalalabad, in eastern Afghanistan, as a secure  area where clashes and military operations will be avoided.    The Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani, and the Prime  Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, in separate meetings with the  Pakistani Charge d'affaires in the last 48 hours, have shown a  positive reaction to a call by Pakistan for declaring Jalalabad  as a secure area. A spokesman for the Pakistani Ministry for  Foreign Affairs, in a news conference this evening, announcing  this, added: The acting Pakistani consul in Mazar-e Sharif,  also, in a meeting with General Dostam has received a similar  response to the call.    After recent clashes among rival groups in Kabul, which  began  33 days ago, about 80,000 out of 250,000 Afghan refugees have  sought refuge in Jalalabad and its suburbs. Pakistan's efforts  to declare Jalalabad as a secure area can be construed as a  restraining act toward Afghan refugees entering Pakistani soil.  During the first 10 days of fighting in Kabul, about 17,000 new  Afghan refugees entered Pakistan and eventually, some three  weeks ago, Islamabad banned Afghan nationals from entering that  country without a valid visa.</p>

			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ATWOOD'S HUMOR  </P> <P> I hope readers won't be put off by the emphasis on pain and poetry in your  recent review of Margaret Atwood's "Cat's Eye" (Book Review, Feb. 19). Perhaps  it takes a woman to see that Atwood's is a very funny novel, as well as a  painful one. I for one am tired of reading about how grim her work is; if you  like intellectual black humor, no one catches girls growing up and women  growing older better than she. But then male wrinkles and dewlaps can still be  termed "distinguished" in this culture. Female readers know otherwise.  </P> <P> MITZI MYERS  </P> <P> FULLERTON  </P></p>

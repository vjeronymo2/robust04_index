			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Arkadiy Volskiy, president of the Russian </F> Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, by Arkadiy  Zhemchugov, DELOVOY MIR correspondent; place and date not given:  "From Davos with Satisfaction and Bitterness"]    [Text] These, it would seem, mutually exclusive faint  notes--satisfaction and bitterness--alternate in the expressions  of Arkadiy Volskiy, president of the Russian Union of  Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, who shared his impressions  with Arkadiy Zhemchugov, a DELOVOY MIR columnist, about the  World Economic Forum that was held in the Swiss health resort  town of Davos.    "The Davos forum," said A. Volskiy, "which has been bringing  leaders of the world of business and politics together for  almost a quarter of a century already, presents broad  opportunities for the establishment and development of both  bilateral and multilateral business contacts. Moreover, besides  Davos, meetings are held regularly in one or another country of  the world. In May of this year, for example, such a meeting will  be held in Moscow under the motto 'Business in Russia.'  Approximately 400 representatives of the business world abroad  have already expressed a readiness to come to the Moscow forum.    "We have been participating in the World Economic Forum for  only a few years, starting in 1990, when the RUIE [Russian Union  of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs] was empowered to represent  the interests of our country in Davos. We have used this short  period to establish business contacts with foreign  entrepreneurial circles. Literally dozens of different contracts  have been signed.    "This time our presence in Davos was not without results. On  the whole, that which we were striving for was achieved at the  negotiations that were held: a deep and professional discussion  of the problems and difficulties of present-day Russia. The work  of the forum, as is well known, was not limited to plenary  meetings. I would say that it was conducted mainly in sections,  or, as it is also put, in thematic seminars. And here I would  especially like to note the effective work of two sections:  banks and business.    "In the first of them, details were worked out and  conditions  were agreed to for financial transactions in today's Russia. In  addition, the agreements achieved were formulated through  conciliatory decisions.    "In the business section, practically every Russian  entrepreneur came out with meaningful information about how to  conduct business under present-day Russian conditions, what  difficulties will be encountered, how to overcome them, etc.  This brought results: Numerous transactions were outlined with a  real promise of their being signed in the near future. The  greatest interest was displayed by Indian and Japanese firms,  although others also were not detached onlookers.    "It seems to me that a real return can also be expected from  meetings with our former CEMA [Council for Mutual Economic  Assistance] partners. Talks with the leaders of Bulgaria,  Romania, Hungary, and Poland took place in a constructive and  friendly spirit. The exchange of practical experience in the  radical reform of political and socioeconomic structures will  not occur without leaving a trace either for us or for them."    [Zhemchugov] In his speech at the plenary session of the  Davos Forum, our prime minister announced Russia's readiness to  create a multilateral council of foreign and Russian bankers,  investors, and entrepreneurs for the specific study together  with them of possible investment cooperation by industries and  enterprises. Your comments...    [Volskiy] I will note right off that the initiative of our  prime minister was met by broad support at the forum, first of  all on the part of the European Bank of Reconstruction and  Development and the IMF, which intend to send their  representatives to Moscow, where this international organ is  supposed to be established in May-June. Representatives of the  large banks of Russia who were in Davos reacted just as  positively to this.    But if we are talking about the essence of the matter, the  initiative of Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin implies the  creation first of all of multilateral banking and foreign trade  structures. And this is why.    The representatives of world business continuously reproach  us for the fact that the necessary legislative basis is lacking  in Russia to this day, and that in this respect Russia  noticeably lags behind Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. And this is  actually the case. These two republics have already adopted, for  example, such normative acts as the law on concessions and the  law on guaranteed export of profits, and insurance of the  entrepreneurial market against political instability has been  introduced. But we have not yet come close to any of this,  although we have been discussing it for two years already. The  result of our sluggishness is not slow in coming: In the last  two or three months 19 foreign firms moved from Russia to  Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.    We, i.e., along the RUIE line, have already prepared six  draft laws to protect the rights of foreign entrepreneurs. We  will strive for their adoption through our Duma group--we have  20 deputies there.    However, it seems to me that our legislation should satisfy  both sides: us and our partners from abroad. It will be possible  to achieve this through the multilateral council conceived by  our prime minister, in whose structure, for example, joint  groups on problems of business and legislation, etc., will be  established. It is in this that I see the main objective of his  initiative in Davos.    [Zhemchugov] It was reported in the mass media that Russian  representatives in Davos expressed sharply differing estimates  on the current situation in our country and on the progress and  outlook for economic reform. What can you say in this regard?    [Volskiy] Strictly speaking, there were two groups of  Russians in Davos. One of them consisted of the official  representatives of Russia, among whom were representatives of  private entrepreneurial structures, the director corps,  well-known economic scientists, and political figures. People  like Ivan Kivelidi, Mark Goryachev, Irina Khakamada, Aleksandr  Vladislavlev, Professor Yevgeniy Yasin, Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, and  many others.    The other group consisted of those who were in Davos at the  personal invitation of the organizers of this forum. They were  Boris Fedorov, Nikolay Shmelev, Sergey Vasilyev, and some others.    I do not question the right of the hosts to present  different  points of view to the forum participants about what is happening  in Russia. It is very likely that they tried to see to it that  the picture was objective. But what turned out was absolutely  different.    Two diametrically opposed points of view were brought to the  attention of forum participants. One--reforms are proceeding in  Russia, and they will continue, but they need certain  adjustments. The other--reforms are at an end, and economic  collapse and a return to the past are in store for the country.    Our prime minister, barely having set foot on Swiss soil,  had  to talk not about the outlook for cooperation between Russian  and world business, but, in fact, to disavow the statements of  some of his contemporaries who are unnecessarily dramatizing the  situation in Russia.</p>

			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> A SLIMMED-DOWN 27TH CABRILLO FESTIVAL  </P> <P> After exceeding its budget of $375,000 by $25,000 last year, the Cabrillo  Festival leadership has tightened its belt for the 27th annual summer music  festival, in and around this slow-paced, Central California beachfront town.  </P> <P> In the summers 1986-88, Cabrillo held forth in a tent on the University of  California campus north of downtown, high on a hill overlooking the population  center. In 1989, "for economic reasons," according to executive director  Michael Stamp, the festival has returned to locales mostly closer in and  predominantly churchly: Of the 12 concerts this month, 10 of them are scheduled  in houses of religion.  </P> <P> The basic problem, since the first Cabrillo Music Festival in 1963, remains.  Viable concert halls seating more than 540 people -- the capacity of Cabrillo  College Auditorium, original home of the festival -- simply do not exist at  this end of Monterey Bay.  </P> <P> For 1990, no decisions have been made. "We may return to the tent, or we may  not," says Stamp. "Coming back to town is probably temporary." Not  coincidentally, he adds, the 1989 festival budget has been pared to a  manageable $311,000.  </P> <P> The happy concertgoers at the second, third and fourth performances of the 1989  series, Friday and Saturday and First Congregational and Holy Cross churches,  showed no outward signs of festival burnout.  </P> <P> Nor did they have any reason to. The Friday night orchestral concert, led  vigorously by Neil Varon, an American conductor who has held major posts in  Dusseldorf for most of the past decade, displayed the 1989 ensemble to best  advantage in exposing scores by Robert Erickson, Shostakovich and Brahms.  </P> <P> The Saturday afternoon performance, also at First Congregational, gave the same  orchestra more opportunities for showing off -- colorful pieces by American  composers writing between 1912 and 1948. Again, the ensemble shone.  </P> <P> And a stand-and-cheer reception erupted after the second and final installment  in cellist Janos Starker's and pianist Dennis Russell Davies' Beethoven cycle  Saturday night in Holy Cross Church, downtown. Holy Cross is arguably the  spiritual home of this festival; many of the memorable performances in these 26  years have taken place here.  </P> <P> Since those early days -- Gerhard Samuel was the founding conductor of Cabrillo  -- inspired cronyism has been a hallmark of the festival.  </P> <P> Davies, music director since 1974, while finding fresh compositional voices,  esoteric scores and new musical personalities to present here, has also created  a core group of solo and orchestral personnel. Continuity among its  participants accounts for some of the high artistic standards the festival has  achieved.  </P> <P> On Saturday night, Starker, a longtime Cabrillo visitor, gave, with his friend  Davies, a memorable Beethoven performance, topped off by a seraphic and probing  reading of the D-major Sonata, Opus 102, No. 2. In a world overfilled with  cello virtuosos, Starker remains the model of musical elegance -- noble of  statement, gorgeous but lean tone and stylistic pertinence. Davies' resourceful  and commanding pianism matched his partner effortlessly.  </P> <P> Friday night, the 1989 orchestra supported Starker and violinist William  Preucil strongly in a rousing and solid account of Brahms' Double Concerto.  Conductor Varon found the propelling elements in Shostakovich's often-neglected  First Symphony and, apparently, most of the colors in Erickson's brilliant  "Auroras" of 1985.  </P> <P> Music by Virgil Thomson, John Becker, Charles Wakefield Cadman, William Grant  Still, William Schuman and Leonard Bernstein -- much of it unfamiliar -- made  up the fascinating, 60-minute program at the Saturday afternoon concert. Ken  Harrison, one of the festival's founding musicians, conducted gamely, though he  said more than he needed to between pieces.  </P></p>

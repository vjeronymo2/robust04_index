			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The existing regulations regarding interim use of bottled water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to avoid an unreasonable risk to health state that the PWS is fully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible for the provision of sufficient quantities of bottled water to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> every customer via door-to-door delivery. The Option being proposed today  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Option 1) would similarly require door-to-door delivery by the PWS to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> persons in the target population when the sulfate MCL is exceeded. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests comment on whether this door-to-door delivery requirement is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate for the sulfate rulemaking, or whether the requirements should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be more flexible. For example, several possible means of delivery might be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowed. Distribution points could be authorized to stock and supply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bottled water to the target population, with coupons issued to consumers in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the target population redeemable at the distribution point. PWSs supplying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bottled water to households would deliver that water upon request and free  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of charge, except as discussed under III.B.4.c. above. EPA requests comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the degree of flexibility needed in the mechanism for delivery of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bottled water that meets the sulfate MCL.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) POU/POE devices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The existing regulations for variance and exemption conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (&sect;142.62) also describe the requirements for allowing a PWS to use POU or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> POE devices. These regulations state that it is the responsibility of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PWS to operate and maintain the POU and/or POE treatment system. Before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> POU or POE devices are installed, the PWS obtains the primacy agent's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval of a monitoring plan which ensures that the devices provide health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection to the target population equivalent to that provided by central  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment. The PWS must apply effective technology under a State-approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan. The microbiological safety of the water must be maintained at all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> times. The State must require certification of adequate performance, field  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing, and if not included in the certification process, an engineering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design review of the POU/POE devices. Under &sect;142.62(h), the design and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application of the POU/POE devices must consider the potential for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increasing concentrations of heterotrophic bacteria in water treated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activated carbon. The State must be assured that buildings connected to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the system have sufficient POU or POE devices that are properly installed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintained, and monitored such that all consumers will be protected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The existing regulations described above would be applied in both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Options 1 and 4. EPA assumes that only Options 1 and 4 would entail the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of POU/POE devices, since in Options 2 and 3, bottled water would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely be more cost-effective, given the reduced target population. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency seeks comment on whether all of these existing requirements should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be proposed in the case of sulfate MCL exceedence, or whether more flexible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements would be appropriate. For example, if recordkeeping could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate that an effective maintenance program was in place to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proper functioning of the treatment equipment and compliance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MCL, some reduction in monitoring might be foreseen. The efficiency or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longevity of certain types of POU or POE devices might also be considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Effective Dates for Initial Monitoring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Initial monitoring for all systems would begin in the first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January after the effective date of the rule. EPA's issuance of the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sulfate rule is scheduled for May 1996. The effective date will be 18  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> months after the promulgation of the final rule, or November of 1997. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this schedule is maintained, the initial monitoring for sulfate would begin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in January 1998 for all systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Sampling Location.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed regulation, both ground water and surface water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems would take a minimum of one sample at every entry point to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution system which is representative of each well or source after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment. The number of samples a system must take will be determined by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the number of entry points. This will make it easier to pinpoint possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contaminated sources (wells) within a system. In both surface and ground  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water systems, the system shall take each sample at the same sampling point  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unless conditions make another sampling point more representative of each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source or treatment plant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Monitoring Frequency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Surface water systems would be required to monitor annually and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ground water systems would sample every three years. Systems which comply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by Option 1 would not be required to continue monitoring the water in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution system for sulfate. That water may continue to exceed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sulfate MCL, but the PWS would be in compliance by providing Alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Water and public notification to target populations. However, the water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would still have to be monitored for and meet MCLs for other contaminants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Public Notice Requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposes that PWSs who use central treatment and who are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nevertheless not in compliance with the sulfate MCL would be subject to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public notification requirements in &sect;141.32. However, the Agency recognizes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that having different public education/notification requirements for those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems choosing central treatment and those choosing Option 1 may create  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confusion, and seeks comment on this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For PWSs authorized by the State to use whichever option (1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through 4) is promulgated in the final sulfate rule, public notification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements are proposed to be those described in section III.B.4.b.3 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this Notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> State Implementation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Act provides that States may assume primary implementation and enforcement responsibilities for the PWS program (primacy). 40 CFR part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 142 contains EPA's primacy regulations. In States or tribal governments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where EPA has direct implementation, resource constraints make it unlikely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the Agency would offer the alternative options (1 through 4, whichever  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is promulgated) to systems. EPA Regional Offices will, however, have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discretion to consider particular circumstances in their decision about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether or not to offer and implement the alternative option. The Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumes that most States with primacy would offer the alternative option,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but requests comment on this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fifty-five out of 57 jurisdictions have applied for and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received primacy under the Act. To implement the federal regulations for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drinking water contaminants, States must have legal authorities which are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at least as stringent as the federal regulations. To update their programs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States must comply with the requirements in 40 CFR 142.12 on revising  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved primacy programs. This proposal describes the regulations and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other procedures and policies States would need to adopt or have in place  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to implement the new regulations for sulfate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this proposal, States would be required to adopt the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following requirements: Modifications to &sect;141.23, Inorganic Chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sampling and Analytical Requirements, &sect;141.32, Public Notification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Requirements (i.e., mandatory health effects language to be included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public notification or violations), and &sect;141.62(b), Maximum Contaminant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Levels for Inorganic Contaminants, where sulfate has been added to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> list.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to adopting drinking water provisions no less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stringent than the federal regulations listed above, EPA is proposing to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow States to adopt certain requirements related to this regulation in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to have their program revision application approved by EPA. This rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposes to provide flexibility to the State with regard to implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the monitoring requirements for sulfate depending on whether a system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chooses central treatment or the alternative method of compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgated in the final rule. In all cases, States would decide and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inform PWSs as to whether the alternative method of compliance (referred to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as Option 1 for simplicity) promulgated in the final sulfate rule will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowed. Specifically, States would be authorized to offer Option 1 as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> means of compliance to PWSs who exceed the sulfate MCL. Under Option 1,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State would need to approve the monitoring plan of a PWS that chooses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Alternative Water and public education/notification as a means of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance. The requirements would be as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) State Primacy Requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure that the State program includes all the elements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary for an effective and enforceable program, the State's request for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval must include a plan that each system monitor for sulfate by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> end of each compliance period. If the State is planning to authorize PWSs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to use Option 1, it would need to submit the text of State laws requiring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Alternative Water and public notification/education program, and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> description of the State's plan to oversee compliance of the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States planning to issue monitoring waivers would do so according to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of &sect;142.16.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

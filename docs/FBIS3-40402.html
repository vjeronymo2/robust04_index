AIR &amp; COSMOS interviewed Gerard Longuet, Minister of  Civilian Space in France on new European and French initiatives  starting with the experimental telecommunications satellite  recommended by Yves Sillard, a program the French minister wants  to decide on and start up in 1991.    [AIR &amp; COSMOS] What are your priorities for Europe?    [Longuet] My first concern is to confirm the missions of  Ariane 5 to get the favorite launcher of the Europeans for their  programs but also for European participation in the future  international orbital station prepared by the United States with  Russia.    [AIR &amp; COSMOS] So, you are in favor of participating in  this station?    [Longuet] That would be reasonable to say. When it comes to  inhabited infrastructure, you could not really run three of  these operations centers in the United States, in Russia, and  Europe. There are thus some economic and political virtues to  this cooperation, because that would permit substantial savings  and would promote the process of modernization in Russia.    [AIR &amp; COSMOS] What part could Europe play in that  project?    [Longuet] I should hope that Europe would be a major partner  because manned flights are an important objective for the  future. Europe should, as a matter of priority, make  contributions in kind, first of all, for the construction of the  international space station and then during the operations  phase. The accent should particularly be placed on freight  transport, in other words, equipment for logistic support. On  that score, Ariane 5 should be picked as one of the bases for  European contribution to the future international station.    [AIR &amp; COSMOS] What are the other possible  contributions?    [Longuet] In that context, Europe must contribute something  indispensable, something that is targeted toward its strong  points. Ariane 5, of course, stands in the foreground; we will  be involved in the Columbus manned laboratory module and our  effort can be concerned with logistic support for the station.    [AIR &amp; COSMOS] Have the French and Germans finalized  their work on the engine?    [Longuet] My, what a negative attitude! Those two countries  are and will continue to be the two foremost contributors to ESA.    I see my colleague Kruger (Minister of Space) frequently and  he is trying to work out maximum consensus in Germany. Our  common objective is to arrive at an agreement on the  international space station as soon as possible.    [AIR &amp; COSMOS] Can we look forward to a decision on the  major European projects when the ESA board meets in  December?    [Longuet] It may be a little bit too early to finish the  whole thing off. Moreover, conditions for association under the  international space station project in Europe have not yet been  finalized.    [AIR &amp; COSMOS] Is there no way to get the new European  projects off the ground to avoid having to send the teams of  specialists home?    [Longuet] French funding has been going up. In 1994, we have  a substantial increase of more than 7%. It is primarily  oriented toward European programs. Besides, we now have joint  financing with Ariane 5 that will make it possible to complete  the program and put the rocket in operation in 1996.    AIR &amp; COSMOS] Might we also look forward to more  powerful models and/or small launchers?    [Longuet] Before we can push the development of Ariane  5--something we are now thinking about--the manufacturers have  to win the battle of price competitiveness!    I asked the CNES [National Center for Space Studies] to  analyze the situation and to let me have some proposals for  small launchers. The analysis would have to consider domestic  and European industrial capabilities and, beyond that, there  would have to be a market estimate, also considering  requirements for small scientific, military, or  telecommunications satellites. The report should be forwarded to  me early in 1994.    [AIR &amp; COSMOS] What is your interest in manned  programs?    [Longuet] For the government, man in space is not an end in  itself. My priorities--that were picked by the government  meeting in Cabinet last year--deal with practical applications:  telecommunications, observation, and weather. Activities of a  technological bent are also being pursued constantly.    [AIR &amp; COSMOS] What are the prospects for  telecommunications and observation?    [Longuet] I find that, looking at telecommunications, where  we have a growing tendency toward the numerical expression of  images, there is a heavy demand for transmission capacities,  pointing to the need for launching Telecom 2C within a year and  building Telecom 2D for launch in 1996.    This telecommunications demand can be handled commercially,  and hence, commercial operation (other than amortization) of  observation satellites is well balanced. Telecom and Spot thus  are two very powerful practical application programs. These are  two priorities for French space policy, and I see no reason why  we should give preference to one over the other! Space  communications constitute an important market and space  observation is part of our sovereignty.    [AIR &amp; COSMOS] When will you decide on the next  Spot?    [Longuet] Pursuing the Spot and Helios national space  satellite programs is a matter of prime importance. A  combination of efforts in the construction of civilian and  military satellites will be perpetuated for the next generation  of satellites, that is, Spot 5 and Helios 2, which the  government will have to decide before the end of 1994.    [AIR &amp; COSMOS] What does the "Sillard Report" do for  telecommunications?    [Longuet] Our efforts on telecommunications dropped to less  than 2% of the CNES budget. Now, that sounded an alarm  signal  for us!    Early in July, I therefore asked Yves Sillard to get a  brainstorming group together, including the principal operators  in the field, in industry and the administration, to let me have  some proposals for correcting the situation.    Yves Sillard sent me his report recently. It already has the  great merit of being drawn up on a basis of consensus, both as  regards industry (with the association of the three main firms  concerned, that is to say, Alcatel Espace, Aerospatiale, and  Matra Marconi Space) and the government since it gets France  Telecom, DGA [General Delegation for Weapons], DGAC [General  Directorate of Civil Aviation], DGSI [Directorate General of  Industrial Strategies], and CNES together.    [AIR &amp; COSMOS] What are you going to do about that  report?    [Longuet] Yves Sillard recommends building and launching an  experimental satellite to try new technologies out in orbit,  such as ion power, "active" antennas (with electronic scanning),  or on-board switching. I certainly agreed to that objective. The  nation's space industry does need an experimental  telecommunications satellite.    That is a good basis for embarking on a national program  that  will rally the three manufacturers under the direction of CNES  and that would also be managed in association by France Telecom  and DGA.    I think, however, that the project can or should be open to  European participation from the beginning.    But I should hope that France would retain a role as major  organizer. And, above all, I would hope that CNES would draft a  specific satellite project that I could then submit to the prime  minister in the spring of 1994.    [AIR &amp; COSMOS] How will this project be financed?    [Longuet] The Sillard report calls for sharing between CNES,  which would hold the preponderant part, as well as France  Telecom and DGA. The whole thing would have to be finalized  during the next few months so that the development of the  experimental satellite could be started before the end of 1994.    [AIR &amp; COSMOS] Would that be an occasion for going  further in the reorganization of French space industry?    [Longuet] That looks a bit premature to me. I support the  reorganization initiatives aimed at a consolidation of the  European space industry to boost its competitiveness, such as  the efforts undertaken by Matra Marconi Space with British  Aerospace or by Aerospatiale with German Aerospace. I do not  want to force any solutions on the manufacturers concerned. I  can go along with or facilitate what they propose, but it is up  to them to take their responsibilities.    [AIR &amp; COSMOS] How will the French space budget  develop?    [Longuet] I have been trying to get the new administration  to  give priority to the CNES budget. Program allocations went up  slightly for 1994 with a figure of Fr8.4 billion; but above all,  there has been a substantial increase in funding with a figure  of Fr8.2 billion. I have been wanting to make up for the rather  considerable lag on the part of our predecessors when it comes  to payments to industry. This course correction will go on  throughout 1994 and will probably also extend into 1995.    In the future, however, we must no longer think in terms of  two-digit growth, which nobody predicted anyway.    I thus expect the French space establishment (manufacturers,  operators, major research organizations, etc.) to propose to me  an ambitious long-term but financially realistic plan. Under  these conditions, I would fight to get those programs through,  be they domestic or multilateral!  <H5>  Space--A Place for Technological Excellence </H5>   "For France, space is one of its principal points of  technological excellence, synonymous with jobs and exports,"  emphasized Gerard Longuet. He noted that "this is why the prime  minister wanted to put this strategic activity under the  Ministry of Industry and Foreign Trade which has become  responsible for the civilian space budget. The old General Space  Directorate has been attached to my ministry within DGSI  (Directorate General of Industrial Strategies)." The  interministerial character of space was furthermore maintained  since Gerard Longuet shares oversight over CNES with his  colleagues Francois Leotard and Francois Fillon, ministers of  defense and of research, respectively.    "That is no problem," as far as Gerard Longuet is concerned.</p>

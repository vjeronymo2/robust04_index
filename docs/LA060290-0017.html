			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEINSTEIN ON HIRING QUOTAS  </P> <P> I was going to vote for Dianne Feinstein on Tuesday. After all, her TV ads  portray a unique, potentially unbeatable, political animal -- a tough-minded,  level-headed Democrat.  </P> <P> Alas, the truth has come out in the front page of The Times ("Feinstein Vows  Hiring Quotas by Race, Sex," May 27). The lady turns out to be another  soft-headed ultra-liberal trying to buy votes by handing out political  patronage along blatant racial and gender lines.  </P> <P> Now, to her credit Feinstein is being honest. She only wants to do through the  front door what most Democrats and some Republicans have been doing through the  backdoor ever since the 1964 Civil Rights Act was turned on its head by  "affirmative action."  </P> <P> And no doubt Ms. Feinstein will beat the pants off John Van de Kamp who was  mistakenly tried to copy her flanking movement to the left, i.e., "I've  appointed more 'minorities', thank you!"  </P> <P> But she is certain to be squashed by an elephant named Pete Wilson. For the  fat-cat Republicans must be itching to pounce on Feinstein by simply calling  her what she has promised to be -- a racist whose Sacramento hiring hall will  have an invisible, but nevertheless real, sign: White males need not apply!  </P> <P> The irony is that when Feinstein finally exits in November, stage "far left,"  she and her fellow Democrats will have no one to blame but themselves.  </P> <P> And another golden opportunity to help the poor and homeless, regardless of  their race or sex, will have been lost because the stubborn party of the  jackass refuses to move towards the center on race relations.  </P> <P> HYATT SELIGMAN  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 20 (YONHAP) -- Eighty-five percent of  South Koreans believe the 1950-53 Korean war resulted from a  North Korean attack and 53 percent see the possibility of  another Northern invasion, according to a Gallup poll released  Monday.    Gallup conducted the survey May 29 at the request of the  Information Ministry. A total of 1,000 people above 20 years of  age were queried over the telephone on "public consciousness of  national security."    The poll revealed that 85.1 percent of the respondents felt  North Korea triggered the Korean war while a mere 0.8 believed  the reverse. The remaining 14.1 percent replied that they  didn't know.    Asked their opinion on national unification, 31.4 percent  responded that it should be accomplished at any cost,  representing a diminished rate in absolute public support for  national reunification.    Meanwhile, 38.5 percent supported the present state of  peaceful co-existence while 26.3 percent replied that "if  unified, it's good but if circumstances do not permit, there is  no need to realize it unnecessarily." Just 3.8 percent favored  the present status quo "as unification would bring about a great  deal of confusion."    With regard to paying for unification, 49.8 percent of the  pollees cited inter-Korean economic relations and Southern  assistance for the North in opening its economy. Another 29.6  opted for public donations.</p>

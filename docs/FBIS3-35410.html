			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Ramadan al-Rawashidah and Muhammad Farhan] </F>   [Excerpts] Political parties participating in the Yemeni  coalition government, and Yemeni party figures signed the pledge  and accord document in Amman on 20 February under the  sponsorship of his Majesty King Husayn.    Hundreds of Yemeni and Arab political figures came to Amman  to participate in the signing ceremony and to witness it.    AL-AHALI covered the event and interviewed Salim Salih  Muhammad, member of the Yemeni Presidential Council and  assistant secretary general of the Yemeni Socilaist Party [YSP].  [passage omitted]    On the series of assassinations of YSP officials, Salim  Salih  Muhammad said the party that carried out the assassinations is  the Jihad organization, an organization sponsored by the Yemeni  Reform Grouping. Some of these elements returned from  Afghanistan and were identified. They were identified only in  the areas where we are present, he said. We supplied all the  information needed concerning their activities and they were  arrested. Others are still at large in Sanaa and the tribal  areas. Some tribes and shaykhs are protecting them, not to  mention some influential armed forces officers.    Muhammad added: That's why the first point of the document  dealt with addressing the security situation, and arresting the  culprits and bringing them to trial. He said: We do not pass  judgment in advance. We leave this to the courts to decide.    Muhammad added that the security issue is now the major  concern of the people. One week ago, oil companies and embassies  gave us information on terrorist operations to take place in the  southern areas, particularly attacks against oil facilities.    Salim Salih Muhammad admitted that some documents show that  this scheme and those responsible for it are connected to Usamah  Bin-Ladin, a Saudi national who is now in Sudan. Usamah  Bin-Ladin is known for his support for fundamentalist movements,  particularly those returning from Afghanistan.    Muhammad added: I told the U.S. ambassador that you nurtured  these terrorists and used them at a certain time to confront the  liberation movements, nationalist regimes, and the socialist  bloc. Now they have turned against you.    Muhammad said: Our stand in the YSP on terrorism is firm. We  are against it, against exporting it, and against all the forms  it may take, whether ideological or any other form. [passage  omitted]</p>

The article says:    NAM is entering into a new phase and independence against  imperialism remains its idea.    The imperialists and the reactionary forces averse to NAM's  independent advancement against imperialism are trying by hook  or by crook to keep off the influence of the movement and  enervate it. The imperialists and some old forces, advertising  international detente, contend that NAM has lost the  effectiveness of its existence, and are setting afloat the claim  that the basic idea must be revised and the orientation of its  action be switched over to economic matters from political  matters.    They are bringing all manner of political and economic  pressure to bear upon the non-aligned countries adhering to the  independent stand against imperialism, seeking to impede the  cause of the independence of the people, and working to split  nam by causing friction and estrangement among those countries.    Such being the situation, the non-aligned countries can not  realize their desire to enjoy an independent life free from  domination and subjugation, unless they enhance the function and  role of NAM and strengthen the revolutionary struggle against  imperialism.    Stressing the need for the non-aligned countries to actively  strive to intensify this movement with firm conviction of the  justice of it and its idea, the article continues:    What is of importance in intensifying NAM is to invariably  maintain its basic idea and principle. NAM is, in essence, a  movement for making the whole world democratic and independent  and its basic principle is to maintain independence, not joining  any bloc.    The idea and principle of NAM are its life and soul and an  indispensable requisite that must be maintained in the whole  course of its activities.    The non-aligned countries must not waver in any complicated  situation, but remain faithful to the idea and principle of NAM  and reject all attempts to detach it from its qnherdct idea and  principle. Of importance in intensifying NAM at present is to  achieve its unity and cohesion.    The non-aligned countries must closely unite on the  principle  of mutual respect and non-interference in other's internal  affairs, equality and mutual benefit and check and foil the  imperialists' moves of division and estrangement with a strategy  of unity.    The non-aligned countries will accelerate the building of an  independent new world and realize at any cost the noble idea of  independence against imperialism by intensifying and developing  NAM, firmly united under the banner of independence against  imperialism.</p>

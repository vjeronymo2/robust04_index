			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Emerging Markets: US-Japan talks move to centre stage - Currencies A series of high-level trade talks this week between US and Japanese officials could provide fresh direction for the dollar. The trade dispute between the two countries has been a key factor in the dollar's weakness this year. There are widely differing views, though, as to what progress can be expected, and hence what the likely outlook for the dollar is. Elsewhere, sterling will be a focus of attention as markets watch the monthly monetary meeting in the UK for any signs of a decision to raise interest rates. In general, currency market activity is likely to be subdued by the labour day holiday in the US today, and the Jewish new year later in the week. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, is scheduled to hold talks with Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Japanese international trade and industry ministry, and Mr Yohei Kono, the foreign minister. Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS in London, argues that a breakthrough in the talks is increasingly likely. On this basis he predicts that the dollar could rise to Y107 to Y110 by the end of the year. Economists at Swiss Bank take a different view. 'We expect that the market will become disenchanted with the persistent trade talks between the US and Japan,' they say, predicting that the dollar will test new lows against the yen. Over the next three months, however, they see the dollar rising to Y105 through central bank intervention, and dollar buying on the back of hopes that the Japanese trade and current account surpluses will shrink. Tomorrow's release of the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of business activity should provide some firm evidence of the strength - or not - of economic recovery. Opinion in the UK is mixed about whether any upward move in interest rates can be expected. Good inflation figures, however, coupled with indications of a slowdown in consumer spending, appear to have shifted the odds in favour of rates staying unchanged, possibly for the rest of the year. This may cause sterling to weaken, but the dollar probably remains a more important determinant of its fate than the level of UK interest rates. Market concerns about Italy's fiscal position have recently contributed to lira volatility. For this reason tomorrow's meeting of the Italian cabinet, to discuss the 1995 budget, will be closely watched.</p>

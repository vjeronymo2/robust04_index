			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: 'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' TAKE ROOT FOR TELEVISION PILOT  </P> <P> "BLOOM WHERE you're planted!" This is the motto of actress Elaine Stritch, who  is in Los Angeles getting ready to make the two-hour pilot for the TV version  of "Steel Magnolias."  </P> <P> "I have decided to enjoy myself no matter what I am doing or where I am  acting," says Elaine, who is most enthusiastic about this project. As you know,  the movie version of the off-Broadway play won fans worldwide and earned much  acclaim for playwright Robert Harling, director Herb Ross and producer Ray  Stark. Now Stark and Columbia are gearing up to do the TV version for CBS. The  cast goes to New Orleans next week to work on location and pick up their  Southern accents.  </P> <P> Stritch is cast in what is now referred to as "the Shirley Mac-Laine role" of  Ouiser. Polly Bergen is portraying the mayor's widow, Clairee, or "the Olympia  Dukakis role." Sally Kirkland will essay the beauty shop owner, Truvy, "the  Dolly Parton role." Sheila McCarthy is cast as the "born-again" beauty  operator, Annelle, "the Daryl Hannah role." "Laverne and Shirley's" Cindy  Williams is to portray the mother, M'Lynn, "the Sally Field role." The pilot  will move right on from after the death of the beloved young Shelby, who was  played on screen by Julia Roberts.  </P> <P> MONEY TALKS! At 20th Century Fox, they are said to be waxing nostalgic -- and  pessimistic -- over reports that the new Bruce Willis movie "Die Hard 2" is $20  million over budget, bringing the current total to $60 million -- and it's not  finished yet. It reminds some people of the good old, bad old days of  "Cleopatra," which cost $40 million of those famous 1962 dollars and nearly  destroyed the studio.  </P> <P> AT PARAMOUNT, they are nervously observing the soaring costs of the Tom Cruise  movie "Days of Thunder." This racing car epic has also reached the $60-million  mark. Its freewheeling producers, Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, have a  certain total autonomy that makes the bookkeepers nervous.  </P> <P> The facts are that since Cruise lost the Oscar he was expected to win for "Born  on the 4th of July," and since the Oliver Stone movie wasn't quite the usual  Cruise smasheroo, "Days of Thunder" rolling on and on does make some people  edgy.  </P> <P> SIDNEY ZION, one of New York's last authentic "characters," has turned in a new  surprising piece of work to publisher Donald I. Fine, and we'll see his novel  "Markers!" at the end of May. The fiction is being touted as this year's  "Bonfire of the Vanities" and "Presumed Innocent" -- a tall order indeed.  </P> <P> Zion was a criminal lawyer and federal prosecutor before he went into the  newspaper business, and I'd hazard a guess that he knows as much about the real  gritty world as did Roy Cohn, whose semi-autobiography Zion helped write a  couple of years ago.  </P> <P> "Markers!" has a list of tributes from the likes of Frank Sinatra, Erica Jong,  Nick Pileggi, Victor Navasky and Jeffrey Hart. Publishers Weekly gave it a rave  and Penthouse excerpts two chapters in its May issue.  </P> <P> THE REWORKED "Annie 2," set to begin rehearsals at the Norma Terris Theater in  Chester, Conn., on April 23, will NOT have Dorothy Loudon playing the evil Miss  Hannigan. After "Annie 2" closed down in Washington some months ago, Loudon  says she was never "invited" to go to Chester.  </P> <P> It looks as if Helen Gallagher, a Broadway belter and favorite from the "Pal  Joey" and "Hazel Flagg" days of big musicals, will play the part of the mean  orphanage overseer.  </P></p>

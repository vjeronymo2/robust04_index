			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Arts: Uncomfortable installations - Lynn MacRitchie reviews the disturbing work of Mona Hatoum The exhibition of the work of Mona Hatoum at the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol demonstrates that it is possible to observe the progression and growth associated with work in the more conventional media such as painting and sculpture just as clearly in the work of an artist who has so far chosen to work in those media generally considered more extreme - performance, video and installation. Examples of Hatoum's video works of the 1980s are included in the exhibition, along with new installation pieces and smaller objects, giving an excellent opportunity to study the progression over a decade of the work of an artist committed to exploring some of the darker aspects of the human condition. While her subject matter is frequently disturbing, Hatoum is quite clear where the priority in her work lies. 'In the process of developing a piece of work, I go through a rigorous paring down of all that is superfluous to arrive at a precise and contained form. Always in my work, in all its manifestations, whether it is performance, video or installation work, formal considerations are of primary importance.' Hatoum is a Palestinian, born in Beirut, who studied in London at the Byam Shaw and Slade schools from 1975 to 1981, thus finding herself safe while her family faced the horrors of civil war. An enduring theme of her work, whether expressed quite obviously in her early performances, in which she endured actual discomfort and pain and not a little danger or in the latest installation pieces, is the expression of physical and mental unease. In earlier pieces this was equated with her own disablement through blindfolding or entrapment in containers of mud or plastic body bags, while the spectator looked on uncomfortably, hoping that actual injury would not be the price of the artist's dedication to this particular choice of formal means to manifest her explorations of torment and fear. In the new installation pieces, the spectator is almost further confounded, experiencing in their own person the dislocations and conundrums the works use to such powerful effect. I doubt whether anyone approaching 'The light at the end' made in 1989 and exhibited at the Hayward Gallery in 1990 as part of The British Art Show will forget their moment of real fear on approaching the six red neon strips suspended between a metal frame at the end of a dimly lit enclosed space and discovering that the piece did not just resemble a grid of radiating elements but was in fact exactly that, the sensation of growing heat and danger as one approached not counterfeit but only too real. Her recent installations, while not involving actual danger, still pack a physical punch. At the Arnolfini, the first room contains a new work, at first glance an exemplary minimalist composition. Sheets of thick plate glass fill the space between two iron girders which support the roof. The wall to the right is covered in sheets of metal, of the same proportion as the sheets of glass. Both glass and metal are studded with smaller metal plugs, marking off the space at regular intervals in a grid pattern. It is not certain whether these have a structural function, or are entirely decorative. Nor is it certain why their outline, unlike that of the larger elements, is unclear. Closer inspection - for the ambiguity of the shapes invites closer inspection  - reveals that they are small magnets, thick with iron filings, their role as spatial indicators subverted by their other, inescapable function as part of a natural and ineluctable process. Nothing is at it seems: even the calm perfection of minimalism, the artist reminds us, must in the end be subject to the darker forces of nature, just as we, as human beings, are subject to the darker forces which make us into the persecutors of our fellows. Those who do not wish to journey to Bristol may see its second large scale piece, 'Light Sentence', concurrently exhibited in London, where it forms part of the Serpentine's 'Four Rooms' exhibit of installation works. It is simply constructed, of ready-made industrial elements, wire mesh lockers and a bare light bulb. The lockers are arranged to form a curve, at the centre of which the bulb ascends and descends, controlled by a motor. Its motion, almost imperceptible in itself, causes a mesmerising pattern of ever shifting shadows to be traced on the enclosing walls, enveloping the shadow of the spectator within their traces. In the elegant spaces of the Arnolfini, the work is menacing but also richly beautiful. At the Serpentine, its windows blocked off to accommodate the piece, darkness and threat become its most powerful characteristics, the haunting beauty of the play of light becoming secondary to a menacing sense of enclosure. Our shadows are part of its structure: we have been trapped in our admiration, complicit in an experience which is darker than it seems. Mona Hatoum, Arnolfini Gallery, until 6 June. 16 Narrow Quay, Bristol, BS1 4QA, telephone 0272 299191.</p>

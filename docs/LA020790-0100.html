			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTH SAYS HEARING MADE FAIR TRIAL IMPOSSIBLE;  </P> <P> IRAN-CONTRA: HE SEEKS REVERSAL OF CONVICTION. HIS ATTORNEY MAINTAINS THAT  EARLIER TESTIMONY WAS A "COMPELLED CONFESSION."  </P> <P> A lawyer for Oliver L. North urged a federal appeals court Tuesday to overturn  his Iran-Contra conviction on grounds that the former Marine's televised  testimony to a congressional committee amounted to a "compelled confession"  that destroyed his hope for a fair trial.  </P> <P> Attorney Barry Simon said the judge who presided over North's trial last year  failed to make sure that the 1987 congressional hearings did not influence  either jurors or witnesses in the criminal case.  </P> <P> Simon also said U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell should have permitted  North to call former President Ronald Reagan as a defense witness.  </P> <P> Two members of the three-judge panel of the Circuit Court of Appeals, Laurence  Silberman and David Sentelle, questioned prosecutors closely about why Reagan  was not put on the stand. Silberman said he is convinced that Reagan's  knowledge of North's case was such that he would have been compelled to testify  had he not been President.  </P> <P> "As a matter of basic fairness," the defense should at least have been given  the written answers that Reagan submitted to the Iran-Contra grand jury in  response to its questions, said Silberman, who was appointed to the court by  Reagan.  </P> <P> Sentelle, also a Reagan appointee, suggested that the former President lost his  right to claim executive privilege because he provided the written answers and  also gave information about the Iran-Contra affair to the Tower Commission and  the independent counsel.  </P> <P> "It seems to me that if you have waived privilege and answered questions, you  can't come back and claim it . . . ," Sentelle said. "If you waive it, it's  gone."  </P> <P> Gesell ruled that Reagan's testimony was not relevant to North's defense  because the two men never were alone together and, therefore, others could  provide any information that the defense might have gotten from the former  President.  </P> <P> Gesell's refusal to require Reagan to testify contrasts with Judge Harold H.  Greene's ruling on Monday that the former President must give videotaped  testimony in the trial, scheduled to begin Feb. 20, of former White House  National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter. But Greene said Poindexter  reported directly to Reagan and North did not.  </P> <P> The hearing ran more than an hour beyond its scheduled 90 minutes because the  members of the panel -- Chief Judge Patricia Wald, Silberman and Sentelle --  peppered Simon and Gerard Lynch, who argued the prosecution's case, with  questions. The jurists, who frequently appeared skeptical of both sides, gave  no hint of their ultimate ruling.  </P> <P> A written opinion will be issued later. That decision may be appealed to the  full circuit court and ultimately to the Supreme Court.  </P> <P> North was convicted last May 4 on three felonies -- altering and destroying  official documents, accepting an illegal gratuity, and aiding and abetting in  the obstruction of Congress. All charges arose from the Reagan Administration's  secret arms sales to Nicaragua and the diversion of some of the proceeds to  anti-government rebels in Nicaragua. The former National Security Council staff  member and his wife, Betsy, listened to the appellate hearing but took no part  in the proceeding.  </P> <P> North spent six days on Capitol Hill giving sworn testimony under a law that  permits congressional committees to compel a person to reveal incriminating  evidence despite Fifth Amendment rights by granting an immunity that is  supposed to guarantee that the testimony will not be used against the person in  court.  </P> <P> About 80% of the prospective jurors in the North case were rejected because  they admitted that the hearings had influenced them. But Simon maintained that  most of the others were also affected, even if they did not realize it.  </P> <P> "Jurors who heard a compelled confession -- which is what immunized testimony  is -- cannot put that out of their minds," Simon said. He added that witnesses  in North's criminal trial may have been influenced by the congressional  hearings. The only way to find out, he said, would have been for Gesell to  conduct a "line-by-line" review of the testimony during a post-trial hearing,  which the judge refused to do.  </P> <P> "That would take months and months," Judge Wald said.  </P> <P> Simon agreed that the procedure would be time consuming but maintained that  nothing less would protect North's Fifth Amendment rights.  </P> <P> Lynch said North's claim that the congressional testimony tainted the entire  criminal proceeding "has a surface appeal, but it goes far beyond what is  required by law." The former Columbia University law professor was recently  named to head the criminal division of the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York  and argued the case for Iran-Contra independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh.  </P> <P> Lynch said Gesell was careful to ensure that the congressional testimony had no  impact on the trial.  </P> <P> Simon devoted very little of his oral presentation to his contention that North  should have been allowed to subpoena Reagan as a witness. But the issue clearly  interested the judges. The court may have to face it again if Reagan appeals  Judge Greene's order to give videotaped testimony in the Poindexter case.  </P> <P> Lynch agreed that Reagan "is treated somewhat differently because he (was) the  President." But, he said, the written answers were so general that they would  have been of little help to the defense.  </P> <P> Reagan's lawyers have not specifically invoked the doctrine of executive  privilege, although they have claimed that the former President is protected by  the Constitution from being forced either to testify or to turn over papers.  </P> <P> In defending the trial judge's decision to bar Reagan's testimony, Lynch said  the evidence would have been irrelevant. Therefore, he said, there was no need  to decide whether executive privilege would apply.  </P> <P> "I'm not talking about executive privilege," Lynch said. "I'm talking about the  relevance of the testimony."  </P> <P> But Silberman maintained that if North had been a State Department official,  the secretary of state would surely have been summoned to testify. He said  Reagan's testimony might have helped North prove that he thought his actions  were authorized and, therefore, not illegal.  </P> <P> Lynch responded that North had never claimed that he received authorization  directly from the President but had, instead, inferred the authorization from  what he was told by Poindexter and former National Security Adviser Robert  McFarlane.  </P></p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Japan warns US it may retaliate A high-ranking Japanese trade official yesterday warned that, if the US were to impose sanctions against Japan and its action were found to be in breach of Gatt rules, Japan could retaliate against the US. The US has already said it would impose sanctions against Japan over a dispute regarding Japan's opening of its mobile phones market. There are also moves in the US to reinstate the Super 301 US trade act clause, which gives Washington the right to impose sanctions against unfair trade practices. However, Mr Yoshihiro Sakamoto, director-general of the industrial trade policy bureau at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, admitted the yen's appreciation, which has hurt Japan's exporters and dampened its near-term recovery prospects, has its benefits for Japanese industry too. He said that, while the yen's rapid appreciation has had a negative impact on the Japanese economy, in the long run the currency realignment would help change Japan's industrial structure by forcing a general restructuring. 'I believe that, over a long time span, the higher yen will have an impact on the competitiveness of Japanese goods and services and that, as a result, Japan's industrial structure will change over time,' Mr Sakamoto said. 'As a result, the export-oriented industrial structure will gradually change as the yen's appreciation forces uncompetitive industries to move production overseas.' The Japanese government needed to do more to encourage this change in industrial structure, by promoting greater inward investment. The government has targetted four main areas where it will work to change Japan's export-oriented industrial structure, help increase imports and thereby benefit consumers as well as reduce the country's huge trade surplus, a target of international criticism. The areas are: deregulation to help increase imports and foreign investment, improvement of government procurement procedures, new measures to increase imports and foreign investment, and improvements in competition policy.</p>

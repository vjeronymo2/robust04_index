			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEER SALE BAN AT UCLA GAMES  </P> <P> This fan got more exercised than the Bruin football team at the Rose Bowl on  Sept. 8. Certain actions, supposedly taken out of consideration for public  safety, apparently had more to do with making up for the loss of beer sale  profits to UCLA and the Rose Bowl.  </P> <P> As in past years, I had a "sipper cup" in my hand as I entered the gate. The  gate staff told me containers were forbidden. I pointed out that the cup was  empty, the temperature was 100 degrees and I wanted to drink water.  </P> <P> "Oh, we'll sell you a bottle of water," they said, "but you'll have to check  your container at the gate and pick it up after the game." Boy am I stupid! I  cooperated. I anticipated a wait at the claim check booth and left the game  early. After standing in line for 30 minutes, I handed in my claim check and  was told by the girl, "Oh yeah, I remember seeing one like that, but it's not  here now."  </P> <P> I've promised myself that I will not spend one nickel at the concessions stands  this year. Next year, they'll probably ban bringing food into the stadium, but  that's OK because I don't plan on renewing my season tickets.  </P> <P> Despite all the sanctimonious talk about encouraging a "family" atmosphere at  the Rose Bowl, the real driver here was the profit motive.  </P> <P> Alums can still get loaded on beer for a buck at the private party in the  parking lot and hypocrisy, not football, is the name of the game.  </P> <P> ELLEN FROST  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

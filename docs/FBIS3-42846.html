			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by PRAVDA correspondent Arkadiy Pasechnik: "Speaker </F> and Prime Minister Hastily Turn Into Agrarians: Moldova on the  Threshold of Elections"]    [Text] One can say with certainty that the campaign  for preparation for early elections to the parliament of  Moldova, set for 27 February, has not calmed the republic's  public life. Rather the reverse: Parties and movements that have  jumped into the election race threw themselves with gusto into  mutual score-settling at all sorts of meetings, in newspapers,  and on the air.    The accents at political battlefields have shifted  perceptibly. Just a few months ago it was considered good  manners in the local political establishment to blame all  troubles on the ill-fated parliament. A complete fiasco in the  economy, the impoverishment of the people, the republic split  into pieces... Now that the parliament is living through its  last days, the role of a scapegoat more often is attached to  representatives of the parties that already had deputy mandates  and are vying for them again (of whom, we should note, there are  quite a few). The logic is simple: They have already messed up  everything and now they are going for it again.    Elections by party lists, by the way, is not the only  innovation in the election law adopted in October of last year.  The number of seats in Moldova's supreme legislative body has  been cut by more than a factor of three--to 104. Only those  parties and movements which will gather at least 4 percent of  the total number of the electorate vote may count on these  mandates.    Such rigid restrictions have predetermined to a large extent  high heat since the very early stage of the election marathon.  Of 26 parties and movements officially registered in Moldova  only half have been able to register their lists with the  Central Electoral Commission [CEC]. Only on the third try did  CEC members vote to register the list of candidates from the  bloc of leftist forces, formed by the Socialist Party of Moldova  and the "Unitata-Unity" intermovement, and even that after  removing from the title the words "leftist forces" and dropping  from the list Petr Shornikov--a current deputy and one of the  intermovement's founders--whose name was close to the top of the  list. Shornikov's "transgression" was that he had delivered a  series of lectures in Tiraspol university (after he had lost his  job in Chisinau, by the way). "...What we have is an attempt by  representatives of parties and organizations of  unionist-frontist orientation in the CEC to perpetrate a purge  of the future parliament already at the start of the election  campaign," KISHINEVSKIYE NOVOSTI newspaper commented on this  fact.    From the very beginning, the Agrarian-Democratic Party of  Moldova [ADPM] positioned itself as one of the leaders in the  race. The agrarian deputy faction had been a rather impressive  political force in the "departing" parliament as well, which  more than once determined the fate of principal battles. The  peasant tendency for caution and deliberation is reflected  appropriately in the centrist position taken by this party,  which cannot fail to appeal to a majority of rural voters. In  addition, at the very threshold of the election the ADPM  received a solid boost in the personae of current Parliament  Speaker Petru Lucinschi and Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli, who  are listed in the agrarians' electoral list as Nos. 2 and 3,  respectively. Next, most observers line up the contender parties  in approximately the following order: social democratic;  socialist; republican and the party of reform; the CDPF  (Christian-Democratic Popular Front) alliance, and so on.    Local press is currently filled with electoral lists of  parties and blocs and their programs. Most of these lengthy  documents contain very correct ideas and words regarding the  sociopolitical situation in the republic, the necessity of  urgent measures aimed at reanimation of the economy, combating  crime and corruption, and protection of the indigent. The  difference begins to come through as soon as it comes to the  point of discussing the method of future development of Moldova.  Agrarians, social democrats, republicans, and socialists aim at  building an independent state. The other part of the spectrum of  parties--the CDPF, the Democratic Party, and the Democratic  Labor Party--advocate unification with Romania.    Unfortunately, this position of the latter costs the  republic  very, very dearly--from the still oozing wounds of the bloody  conflict on Dniester to immense economic losses stemming from  Moldova's long procrastination regarding joining the CIS and all  resulting consequences. Through suffering, deprivation, and  pain, the society is coming to an understanding of harsh  realities of current life. All last year's sociological surveys  invariably registered the decline in the rating of the Popular  Front and its fixation on unification with Romania, which, in  the opinion of some observers, prompted some CDPF leaders to  hastily distance themselves from it and quickly put together  their own parties and movements. Others see in it only a  pre-election operational maneuver, a peculiar attempt to achieve  victory if not by aptitude (in this case it would be more  appropriate to say--political authority) then by numbers.    Actually, it is unlikely that the "unionists" themselves  believe in their victory. Hence their vicious attacks in the  local radical press against leaders and parties that are  considered likely to succeed. In short, there is no shortage of  predictions. As there is, actually, no substantial spread of  opinions. In all probability the Agrarian-Democratic Party will  win the election with 33-35 percent of the vote--this is the  opinion, for instance, of Anatoliy Gudym [name as  transliterated], the head of the expert center of the  Industrialists Union of Moldova. Social democrats' chances are  considered to be quite good (among their assets are a score of  political initiatives and the European model of reforming the  economy), the party of reform (or, as it is unofficially called,  the directors party), and socialists, who are most consistent in  defending the rights of citizens regardless of nationality.    Overall, many experts believe that the new parliament will  be  an improvement over the previous one. First and foremost by its  qualitative composition: Its core will be comprised of  professional politicians, economists, and jurists. They will, of  course, inherit a terrible legacy. In its legislative "itch" the  previous parliament over three years has "baked" over 200 laws,  which nevertheless did not save the republic from political and  economic cataclysms. Now instead of such a long running in place  (or sometimes backwards) several very serious steps forward will  be required simultaneously: adoption of a new constitution;  ratification of documents on CIS membership; moving the economy  forward; and resolution of the Dniester area and Gagauz  problems. Because in a split Moldova even a new constitution  will remain more of a symbolic document, and one cannot speak,  of course, of an integrated economic organism without the 37  percent of the republic's industrial potential that is located  on the Dniester left bank. Or a reform aimed at nursing this  organism to health. Will the new parliament be able to rid  itself of the intolerance syndrome of its predecessor and set up  an effective political dialog with the Dniester area? For the  time being, however, Tiraspol and Komrat authorities decided not  to hold elections to the Moldovan Parliament in their regions,  which, in the opinion of a number of observers, only plays into  the hands of radicals of all colors.    Finally, one more circumstance that has a most immediate  bearing on the election campaign. President Mircea Snegur, who  somewhat demonstratively had maintained his distance from this  campaign, finally did break his neutrality. He said that he  would support in the elections those parties that advocate an  independent Moldova. And literally a few days ago Snegur  proposed to conduct a national sociological survey--"consult  with the people"--asking just one question: on independence and  integrity of Moldova (the Parliament Presidium accepted this  proposal). In this way the president is, first, trying to gain  support in his struggle against the opposition, which  increasingly vehemently accuses him of blocking the process of  unification with Romania, and, second, wants through the mouth  of the people to give a sort of mandate to future members of the  country's supreme legislative body.</p>

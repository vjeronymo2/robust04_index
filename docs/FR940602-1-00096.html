			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With regard to the nature of the public meeting, EPA intends to provide facilities with considerable latitude. Through discussions with community relations experts from a variety of backgrounds, EPA has found that ``public meeting'' means many things to many people. In most cases, however, it appears that people view public meetings as being similar to public hearings. EPA would like to dispel the idea that public meetings must be similar to formal public hearings; rather, EPA encourages facilities to be creative in their approach towards conducting the pre-application meeting, in order to encourage constructive and open participation with people in the community. The facility may accomplish this goal through any of a variety of meeting formats. EPA further encourages innovation in the type of public meeting by allowing the facility to choose the medium by which it reports the record of the meeting to EPA, as long as the medium provides an adequate record of the meeting. For example, facilities may choose to tape-record discussions at the meeting or find another effective medium with which the public is comfortable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many guidance documents are available on how to conduct public meetings and community outreach. Among them are EPA documents Community Relations in Superfund: A Handbook (January 1992, EPA/540/R&hyph;92/009), RCRA Public Involvement Manual (September 1993, EPA 530&hyph;R&hyph;93&hyph;006), as well as publications by private interests. The applicant may wish to consult these or similar publications for appropriate guidance on how to conduct an appropriate meeting with the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regardless of the guidance source, EPA believes that the facility, in meeting regulatory requirements, should also consider the following factors to conduct what EPA believes to be an appropriate and effective public meeting: first, the applicant should give special attention to process, logistics, content and trouble-shooting when preparing for a public meeting; second, the applicant should provide appropriate public notification, as required by &sect;124.31(c), identify all sectors of the community that the facility will potentially affect, as required by &sect;124.30(a), and provide outreach to interested citizens and officials. All these factors are important to ensure that the audience is representative of the community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The facility should encourage public participation through selection of a meeting date, time, and place that are convenient to the public. The facility should select the date and time of the public meeting to correspond to times when the public is most available; this may require the facility to conduct the meeting after normal business hours. The applicant should make sure that the meeting place has adequate space and is conducive to the type of meeting that the applicant will conduct. The applicant should take care in the development of the content of the meeting to meet the requirement of ``sufficient detail to allow the community to understand the nature of the operations to be conducted at the facility and the implications for human health and the environment'' under proposed &sect;124.31(a). To meet the ``sufficient detail'' requirement, the applicant should have a clear meeting agenda that states the exact reasons for the meeting and the specific objectives of the meeting. The applicant shall give an overview of the facility in as much detail as possible, such as identifying the type of facility (i.e., commercial or private), the location of the facility, the general processes involved, the type of wastes generated and managed, and implementation of waste minimization and pollution control measures. In addition, the applicant should provide information about risk to the public, where available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, trouble-shooting potential problems will help the meeting to run smoothly in the event of unplanned obstacles. Trouble-shooting may involve planning for equipment failures, a shortage of parking spaces, or demonstrations, as well as locating facilities for handicapped individuals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Requirement for public notice at permit application. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Today's proposal would also require EPA or the State to publish a public notice upon receipt of a permit application. EPA proposes that the permitting authority send the notice to everyone on the mailing list. These requirements are consistent with the notice requirements under &sect;&sect;124.10 and 270.42. Unlike the proposed pre-application meeting requirement, the permitting authority must also publish this notice for permit renewals (see Section A.4: Applicability of public involvement requirements, of today's preamble discussion).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Information requirements for the public notice will give people a clear opportunity to contact the appropriate parties for questions and suggestions, sign up on the facility mailing list, and locate the appropriate documents, such as the permit application, for review. The permitting authority must provide the name and telephone number of the facility and permitting agency contacts. EPA suggests that the permitting authority designate a community affairs specialist as the appropriate contact person. The permitting authority must also provide an address to which people can send requests to be put on the facility mailing list. EPA believes that the public should have this opportunity during the permit process, and that the notice at application is a good mechanism for announcing this opportunity. Today's proposed rule requires the permitting authority to provide the notice; however, EPA would like to solicit comments on whether the permitting authority or the facility should be responsible for providing the notice at application submittal. While a person may request to be put on the mailing list at any time during the permit process, EPA intends this requirement to ensure that the permitting authority alerts the public early in the permit process. Finally, EPA is requiring the notice to include specific information about the facility operations, facility location, and the location where the public may review and copy versions of the permit application and other important documents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that these requirements significantly increase the opportunities for, and the effectiveness of, public participation within the permitting process. The requirement for a public notice will tell the public when an application for a permit has been received by the permitting authority. It would also provide information on where the permit application is available for review by the public and, thus, would allow interested people to begin review of the permit application at the same time as EPA or the State authority. The public would have the opportunity to review all aspects of the permit application in its initial form, before EPA or the State review the application for completeness. The public has the opportunity to make suggestions and raise issues for consideration by the permitting agency at any time during the agency's review of the permit application. Consequently, the permitting agency will receive public input earlier in the permit process as well as later, i.e., after the proposal of the draft permit. Another benefit of requiring such a notice is that it may alert the agency to facilities generating high public interest. The public notice will highlight public attention concerning a hazardous waste facility. Public interest and concerns may be expressed to the permitting authority in the form of letters, phone calls, and requests to be put on the facility mailing list. This early stage could be one potential point where the Director may choose to require the facility to establish an information repository. Furthermore, by providing important and timely information at the beginning of the permit application review stage, the permitting authority can better inform the public about the steps of the permit process and the amount of time required for each step.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

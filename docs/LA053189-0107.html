			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUPPLIED GUARDS FOR POLLING PLACES;  </P> <P> SECURITY FIRM AGREES TO SETTLE IN O.C. VOTER CASE  </P> <P> The security firm hired by the Orange County Republican Party to stop  non-citizens from voting last fall agreed Tuesday to pay $60,000 to six  plaintiffs who claimed in a lawsuit that their civil rights were violated.  </P> <P> The settlement, which still must be approved by U.S. District Judge J. Spencer  Letts in Santa Ana, was disclosed Tuesday in court.  </P> <P> If accepted by the judge, the settlement will be the first resolution of  litigation brought in the wake of the poll-guard controversy. The guards caused  an uproar in one of last November's most bitterly contested Orange County  elections, leading not only to an FBI investigation but also to the  introduction of state legislation that would outlaw unsanctioned guards at  polling places.  </P> <P> The lawsuit alleged that the guards, who were carrying signs in Spanish warning  non-citizens not to vote, reportedly intimidated first-time Latino voters and  may have frightened them away from the polls. The suit asked that the election  results be overturned.  </P> <P> Of the various defendants in the suit, only the security company has settled.  Letts indicated that he will not permit other defendants, including Assemblymen  Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) and John Lewis (R-Orange), to make claims that  the security firm is more at fault than they are and should pay any damages.  </P> <P> In effect, lawyers in the case said, the judge was ruling that the individual  actions of Saddleback Security Services Corp. employees who may have violated  the Election Code are a separate issue in regard to whether Pringle, Lewis and  county Republican Party officials intended to influence the outcome of the  election.  </P> <P> San Francisco attorney Kathleen Purcell, who is representing the six  plaintiffs, said Tuesday that she was pleased with the proposed settlement,  adding: "It's a fairly substantial sum of money."  </P> <P> But David A. Robinson, attorney for Pringle and Lewis, was irked both by the  settlement and the judge's statements and said he would appeal.  </P> <P> "The settlement shows that the plaintiffs are merely out to put money in their  pockets," Robinson said. "We also think that the judge is dead wrong. . . . He  abused his authority" in not allowing the other defendants to make claims  against Saddleback Security.  </P> <P> Bruce Gridley, attorney for Saddleback Security, said the firm agreed to the  settlement -- without acknowledging any wrongdoing -- out of a realization that  it was not economical to prolong the dispute. Legal costs, he said, have  already exceeded the amount of the settlement.  </P> <P> Gridley said he would file a motion today seeking to have the proposed  settlement accepted as a "good faith" agreement. The other defendants are  expected to oppose the motion.  </P> <P> Gridley added: "It was uncontradicted by any party either in oral argument or  paper work that there was no intent on the part of Saddleback to influence the  election outcome."  </P> <P> The uniformed guards were stationed at polling places in 20 largely Latino  precincts in Santa Ana on Election Day. They were hired at the suggestion of a  political consultant for Pringle, who ended up winning the costly 72nd Assembly  District election by fewer than 900 votes.  </P> <P> Thomas A. Fuentes, the county Republican chairman who is also a defendant in  the lawsuit, has said that he authorized about $4,000 in party money to hire  the guards because of rumors that illegal voters were to be bused in to tip the  election in favor of the Democratic candidate, Christian F. (Rick) Thierbach.  </P> <P> Darryl Wold, attorney for the Orange County Republican Party, was unavailable  for comment.  </P> <P> As a result of the Orange County controversy, a bill is moving through the  state Legislature that would prohibit any uniformed security guard or peace  officer from being within 100 feet of a polling place without the permission of  the appropriate elections official.  </P></p>

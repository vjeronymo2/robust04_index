			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Xin Hua (6580 5478): "The State Is Taking Steps </F> To Curb the Loss of State Assets"]    [Text] The erosion of state assets is being paid great  attention by the departments concerned, with the state now  taking steps, such as perfecting laws and intensifying reform of  our state assets management system, to solve the problem of  state assets losses. The erosion of state assets occurs mainly  during the establishment of "the three kinds of foreign trade"  and shareholding-system enterprises, when scientific appraisals  of state-enterprise assets are not or were not made, thus  turning state assets through various channels into collective,  individual, and foreign-firm assets, for a loss to the state.    A survey conducted in 1993 found that of over 10,000 state  enterprises operating as Sino-foreign joint or contractual joint  ventures, evaluations of the Chinese side's assets had been  conducted in only one-third of the cases. And most enterprises  evaluate only book assets, creating a loss of state assets of  about 30 billion yuan a year.    Not evaluating or underevaluating state assets when  organizing shareholding enterprises are also common. In  addition, the uncompensated use of state assets to set up  enterprises and administrative-institution units of all  [ownership] natures, also causes erosion of state assets.    It is estimated that in the last decade, state-assets losses  have amounted to about 500 billion yuan, making tax and  state-assets losses two major severe problems for the Chinese  economy.    While developing a market economy, the Chinese Government  has  always adhered to the dominance of the state-owned economy in  our national economy. Even now, key products of importance to  the national economy and the people's livelihood are still  produced mostly by state enterprises, which still provide most  state revenue. The economic might of state enterprises is  growing steadily, with state assets worth 2.6846 trillion yuan  in 1991, and growing 14.3 percent to 3.0697 trillion yuan by  1992.    Analysis shows that the key reason for the loss of state  assets is that the state has not yet established a uniform and  effective state assets management system, with the functions of  current state assets management departments at all levels not  having been converted, and pertinent state assets management  laws incomplete, leaving state assets management lacking a  grounding in higher level and more authoritative laws. In  addition, as property rights mechanisms have not yet been  provided access to enterprises and, when property rights are  sold, certain local governments practice improper administrative  interference, artificially forcing down the proportion of  state-asset shares in "the three kinds of foreign trade" and  shareholding enterprises.    To change this severe loss of state assets, China is now  taking a series of steps.    First, we are inventorying in a planned way state assets and  funds, through which we are clarifying our resources, to verify  and appraise state capital funds. We completed this task for  10,000 state enterprises in 1993, and will do so for another  10,000 in 1994.    We have given permission to over 1,000 accounting and  auditing agencies throughout China to provide assets-evaluation  services, paving the way for valid and accurate assets  evaluations of all concerned parties when state enterprises sell  [transfer] property rights.    Meanwhile, enterprise assets-evaluation certificates  certified by the state assets management sector have become  essential examination and approval documents for upgrading  enterprises to Sino-foreign joint ventures and shareholding.    It is understood that the NPC Standing Committee is now  drafting a "State Assets Law," which will be included in its  immediate legislative plans, and is speeding up the formulation  of "Terms for the Oversight and Management of State Enterprise  Assets," and evaluation targets and methods for state assets  value-preservation and appreciation.    State Administration of State Property officials say that  for  all future state-enterprise property-rights alterations, we will  conduct inventories of assets and funds, delimiting property  rights, settling bonded debts, and registering property rights,  to establish a rigorous examination and approval system.</p>

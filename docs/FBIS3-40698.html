Darawishah is the indubitable  representative of the intermediate generation in the politics of  the Israeli Arabs: His roots are in the Labor Party of the  military government. His refuge is in the Islamic movement. The  election results and the departure of SHAS [Torah Observing  Sephardim] gave fateful strength to Darawishah's influence. With  it, Rabin has a closed bloc. Without it, there is no bloc and  there is no government. Darawishah wags his finger and threatens  Rabin that if he does not appoint him minister, he will take the  finger from him.    Darawishah, members of Labor and Meretz whisper, is nervy,  an  extortioner, and irresponsible. Nervy because he knows that  Rabin cannot seat an Arab alongside of the government table.  There is a security problem, and there is an even more difficult  problem--the reaction of the Jewish public opinion. An  extortioner because he is attacking Rabin at a moment of  weakness. Irresponsible because he is endangering the accord  with the PLO, which most Israeli Arabs, including Darawishah,  himself, support 100 percent.    Essentially, the coalition is now telling Darawishah, and  through him, all Israeli Arabs: You have a choice--either peace  or equality. You will not get both together.    The truth is that, more than teaching us about defects in  Darawishah's character, the crisis is teaching us about the  difficulty of Jews in making order out of there confusing,  impossible relation with Israeli Arabs.    When the Likud was in power, he turned them, ideologically,  into part of the population of the territories. Arabs from  Taybeh were treated the same as Arabs from Nabulus. We are  speaking of one problem, an internal problem. Both of them will  live to win under the government of the Jews.    From a practical aspect, the Likud worked in the opposite  way: They did their best to distance the Israeli Arabs from the  influence of the territories. Every piece of information  regarding the association of Israeli Arabs to the Palestine  Liberation Organization (PLO) was received with great shock. The  smell of betrayal hovered in the air.    The Labor Party came and turned everything upside down:  According to the global view, they are trying to change the  Palestinian problem from an internal to an external one. The key  word to the solution is "withdrawal." The negotiating partner is  Tunisia. The goal, as Rabin formulated it, is that they will  live their lives, and, we, separately, will live our lives.    If there is any logic to conducting policy, even security  policy, the work would have had to break into the separation of  Israeli Arabs from the Arabs of the territories. Up to here, the  PLO--and from here on, the State of Israel. The Israeli  Government will not conduct the politics of Nabulus, and the PLO  will not conduct the politics of Baqah al-Garbayah.    In reality, the opposite is occurring. Ahmad Tibbi, an Arab  citizen of Israel, recently earned the official title of  presidential adviser to the president of the State of Palestine.  Tibbi is a shrewd, political veteran and a superior speaker. His  advice certainly contributed to the peace process. But, it is  difficult to understand how an Israeli citizen could serve in an  official role in a foreign system and to still come, in the  authority of this role, into the prime minister's office. If  Ahmad Tibbi is needed as an adviser to his head of state, it is  fitting to appoint him as Rabin's adviser. This is the proper  message that the Israeli Government can currently deliver to its  Arab citizens.    Darawishah represents a similar dilemma. Recently, knowledge  of the attempt by government factors to convince 'Arafat to  influence Darawishah to cease his threats were published. An  unpleasant smell is rising from this information. If 'Arafat is  Darawishah's landlord, Darawishah has no place next to the table  of the Israeli Government. In contrast, if the citizens of  Israel in Nazareth and Rahat and 'Ar'arah are Darawishah's  emissaries, they and not an angel, they and not a seraph, they  and not 'Arafat, then he is not an extortioner or nervy, any  more so than Ya'aqov Shefi, Menahem Prosh, Shlomo Benyizri, or  any other member of Knesset who is arguing over his vote with  the prime minister.</p>

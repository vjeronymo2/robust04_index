			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions The Capita Group is involved in various aspects of management consultancy. Its recent final results showed some improvement in pre-tax profit and chairman Rodney Aldridge made a broadly optimistic statement. He and chief executive Paul Pindar (who combines the roles of managing and finance director), plus Richard Benton and John Brameld all sold stock on Friday April 29 at 223p. Directors of Capita Group sell stock regularly at this time of year, but the steady rise in the share price has meant that they have raised more money this time than ever before. Secure Retirement is a newcomer to the market. The company develops sheltered housing - one of the sectors to gain more and more prominence in recent years in light of the increasing longevity of the UK population. Following an introduction to the market, all the directors have been dealing apace, dipping repeatedly into the market. While the overall value of the transactions is not enormous when divided by the number of those dealing, the enthusiasm is certainly great. Virtuality also is a recent arrival on the market. In its case, however, the flotation has allowed managing director Dr Jonathan Waldren and chairman David Payne to realise some cash by selling a proportion of their holdings.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          No of Company              Sector      Shares    Value     directors  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bardon Group           BM&amp;M     200,000      196         1 Bluebird Toys          L&amp;Hl       5,000       36         1 BPB Industries         BM&amp;M      10,000       33         1 Brammer                Dist      20,000       66         1* Burmah Castrol         OilI      52,718      440         1* Capita Group           SSer     979,000     2183         4 Cookson Group          DivI      40,011      106         2 Eurotherm Internl      E&amp;EE     300,000     1200         1 Liberty                RetG      40,000      166         1* Regina                 RetF     350,000       11         1 Reuters Holding Plc    Mdia      78,300      412         2* Richardson Westgart     Eng     400,000      360         1 Virtuality Group       SSer     545,000     1526         2 Weir Group              Eng       9,000       31         1 Yule Catto             Chem      65,000      218         1*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Allied Radio           Mdia     400,000       24         2 Berry Birch &amp; Noble    OthF      10,600       13         2 Cooper, Frederick       Eng      18,000       17         1 Lloyds Abbey Life      LifA       2,800       11         1 Pentland Group         Text     100,000       94         1 Prudential Corp        LifA       7,766       24         1 Relyon Group           HseG      20,000       50         1 Rugby Estates          BM&amp;M      50,000       61         1 Secure Retirement      BCon     630,000      328         5 Tomkins                DivI      10,000       25         1 West Trust             FdMa     100,000       39         1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Lyudmila Yermakova and Igor </F> Galkin]    [Text] Moscow April 23 TASS -- Russian tax police reported  32,000 violations of tax legislation in 1993 and over 10,000 in  the first quarter of 1994.    The figures were cited at a session of the Federation  Council, upper house of the parliament, on Saturday.    Members of the House Budget Committee stressed that "tax  privileges have failed to act as a stimulant for industry and in  many cases have been used for dodging taxes."    In 1993 tax inspectors discovered over 1,000 unregistered  legal entities which did not pay any taxes. They instituted  criminal proceedings on more than 600 cases and about 200 in the  first three months of 1994. They also stressed that more and  more often tax inspectors become objects of assaults.    Tax revenues could increase the federal budget by billions  of  roubles, tax police officials said. Last year inspections and  raids helped recover additional 800 billion roubles and over 600  billion in the first quarter of 1994.    Officials complained that the tax system is in "complete  chaos." Non-payment of income tax and value added tax accounts  for the bulk of all tax violations. Enterprises often report  bigger costs of their products than they actually are in order  to avoid paying taxes.    Tax police experts believe only five major taxes should be  left in Russia -- real estate tax, income tax for individuals  and businesses, value added tax and excise tax. They  recommended replacing profit tax with company income tax.</p>

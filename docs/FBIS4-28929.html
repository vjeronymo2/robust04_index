			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["`Sanctions' and Dialogue are Incompatible" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 15 (KCNA) -- U.S. Secretary of State  Christopher and Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev on June 10 in a  joint press conference concerning the talks in Turkzy made  public that the United States and Russia agreed on submitting to  the UN Security Council a joint resolution envisaging a  convocation of an international meeting on the security and  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula while applying  "sanctions" to the DPRK, according to a report.    NODONG SINMUN today says this shows that the moves to  isolate  and stifle the DPRK are expanding, assuming a new aspect in the  international arena.    The news analyst goes on:    It is not to be thought of to convene an international  meeting while applying "sanctions" to us. "Sanctions" and  dialogue are incompatible.    We expressed some concern over the Russia-proposed  international meeting, proceeding from the hope that it may  make an affirmative contribution to a fair solution of the  nuclear issue and other matters on the Korean peninsula through  negotiations after the rupture of the DPRK-U.S. talks. But we  will never allow any attempt to make the international meeting a  lever of pressure on us.    We have made it clear that in case any "sanction" is applied  to us, the parties joining it whether it is at their own will  or against their will, and the parties backing it, would take  the responsibility for this. This is not an empty talk.    We are ready to solve the matter through dialogue and  negotiations but we will strongly counter pressure and  "sanctions" against us.</p>

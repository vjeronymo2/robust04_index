			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / UN, Serbs to discuss extending relief effort UNITED NATIONS officials are today due to hold negotiations with Serb commanders on the evacuation of the wounded from Konjevic Polje, a Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia-Hercegovina, and the despatch of emergency relief to nearby Srebrenica, where conditions are reported to be worse. General Philippe Morillon, commander of UN forces in Bosnia, is expected to meet General Ratko Mladic, Bosnian Serb commander, and General Sefer Halilovic, Bosnian army chief, in Sarajevo to try to broker a ceasefire in eastern Bosnia and send UN military observers into the region. While UN officials press for the evacuation, Serb commanders are trying to link any agreement with an exchange of Serbs from Moslem-held regions of Bosnia. Amid reports of dire conditions in Srebrenica, six US aircraft early yesterday parachuted 38 tonnes of food and medical supplies over the enclave. Srebrenica's population has doubled to 60,000 as refugees seek sanctuary in the Bosnian government stronghold. A doctor of the World Health Organisation who hiked through the hills to Srebrenica on Saturday said about 2,000 people were reported to be sick and wounded in the town in the hills above the River Drina. Dr Simon Mardel estimated that 200 seriously wounded people needed urgent evacuation and that an additional 9,000 women, elderly and children were seeking safe passage. 'This is the worst situation brought to my attention since I came to former Yugoslavia in July,' Sir Donald Acheson, WHO special representative, said after hearing Dr Mardel's report. Meanwhile, Gen Morillon, after crossing Serb lines on Saturday on a fact-finding mission to Cerska, said there did not appear to be evidence of atrocities. Ham radio operators last week said hundreds of Moslems had been killed when Serb forces seized the town. 'We have seen evidence where most of the houses were shelled or burned but I did not see any evidence of massacres,' Gen Morillon said. However, the commander of Bosnian government forces said yesterday that Gen Morillon had arrived too late and had been duped by Serbs. He accused the general of making an 'illegal tour' of east Bosnia. Relief workers said at least 175 wounded and sick needed urgent evacuation from Konjevic Polje. 'People have had amputations, and are suffering from wounds they have received from shrapnel, bullets and mines,' said Ms Lyndal Sachs, of the Belgrade office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Local leaders say the hamlet's population has swollen to 35,000 people, half of whom are refugees from Cerska. Konjevic Polje was the target of US air-drops for two nights last week. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, said on American TV yesterday that UN member nations must be prepared to send troops against Serbian forces if they failed to agree a negotiated peace, Reuter reports.</p>

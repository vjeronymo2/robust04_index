			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: Anger begins to subside in Tory constituencies ACCORDING to her agent, Mrs Elizabeth Peacock, Conservative MP for Batley and Spen, may vote against the government today because 'she is a Yorkshire woman fighting for Yorkshire men'. Last night she said she was prepared to resign as parliamentary private secretary to Mr Nicholas Scott, social security minister, if the government's coal review did not cover all the condemned pits. 'I am prepared to go to the wire,' she added. But emotion in some other constituencies where their Tory MPs have previously threatened rebellion appeared to be less clear-cut as some party members closed ranks. The blunting of rebellious tendencies was shown in the Brent constituency of Sir Rhodes Boyson, a member of the 1922 committee who had previously been an outspoken critic of the pit closures. Last Thursday, 18 Tory loyalists sitting on the local party association committee unanimously passed a motion expressing their 'fury and dismay' at the 'incompetent' way the closures had been handled by the government. By late yesterday afternoon, though, an official for the committee described the government's latest position on coal as 'much more acceptable'. At Broxstowe, the constituency of Mr James Lester, another previous critic of the government, the flood of telephone calls that followed the government's first announcement on pit closures had by yesterday ground to a halt. Mr Barry Thurnell, the local agent said: 'Most of our people were complaining . . . about the way their closure was being handled. Ninety per cent of the calls we received before Monday said 'We knew it had to happen, but not like this'.' Mr Eric Birnie, party agent for Mr Bill Walker in Tayside North, said his office had taken 60 phone calls since Thursday, criticising government handling of the closures and demanding an explanation. Monday's statement by Mr Heseltine had not reversed the trend: 'There have been one or two phone calls saying they are now quite satisfied, but not nearly in the numbers that have said they were appalled.' Mrs Elizabeth Gilliland, agent for Mr Nicholas Winterton, said the general tone of calls to the Macclesfield constituency was that Mr Heseltine's statement had not been enough. There had only been one call supporting him. In Taunton, party agent Mr Rodney Pilgrim said: 'Coal has touched a raw nerve. It's a protest that has been building up on the back of other issues such as Europe and the general financial turmoil.'</p>

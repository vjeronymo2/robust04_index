			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: How to keep your fortune - Peter Knight has some tips on warding off villains SWOP THE Patek Philippe for a Swatch, trade in the Rolls for a Mondeo (no personal number-plates allowed), go ex-directory, jettison your British Airways Executive Club gold card and become irregular in your habits. Above all, try hard to be dull. Being dull is the safest and cheapest way for the super-rich to stay alive and keep their families and fortunes intact. Conforming to common-sense rules reduces the risks posed by those who have plunder on their minds. 'Criminals are like jays. They are attracted to things that are bright,' says Simon Adamsdale, a director of security experts Control Risks. 'To reduce the risk you have to keep a low profile because that is a denial of information to the criminal.' Staying safe is all about managing risk, which is mostly about the control of information. Robbers, kidnappers and other horrible people want to know as much as possible about their target, to reduce the risk of being caught. Denying villains this information will make their task more difficult and could encourage them to look elsewhere. 'The whole principle is to avoid a situation in which you are threatened. Once you are surrounded by armed people or very fit young men, for example, you have little chance of escape. The key is to stay alert and avoid the situation if possible,' says Adamsdale. To stay out of trouble, Control Risks recommends adopting five common-sense principles: Be aware of the risks. Learn how to detect suspicious signs. Find out, for example, where the dangers lie when travelling abroad. Know when it is wise to cross to the other side of the street rather than risk being confronted by a suspicious character. Maintain a low profile. Keep out of the society pages, go ex-directory, get an ordinary-looking car, live in a modest house. Be erratic. Make sure that your routine does not become too predictable  - make it difficult for the jays to swoop. Equip yourself with good communications that enable you to call for help in an emergency. Create layers of protection. Make sure your home, for example, is protected with more than a picket fence and a chihuahua (install alarms, rottweilers, lights, locks and a safe room at the core of the house with good communications). Gadgets found in the security shops - anything from night sights to debugging devices - are a waste of money unless they are part of an overall security plan. Learning about the risks and how to reduce them, and developing such a plan, is simple and, compared with the cost of top accountants, cheap. Security consultants - there are many in the telephone book - will offer help. Choosing the right consultant is rather difficult because there is no guide to recommend best buys, so check with a super-rich friend or high-level executive in the oil business (a risky occupation) to see who they use. Locate your adviser and start with a short consultation. Fees vary according to the circumstances, but think in terms of a few hours, which will be charged at a half-day rate. Control Risks, for example, charges Pounds 375 for one consultant to talk to a group. A two-hour consultation with you alone costs about the same. For a high-risk person, Control Risks recommends a two-day assessment and basic training. An experienced - probably former police or former armed services - consultant will analyse your security position, advise on what sort of protection you need and then teach you or your chauffeur how to drive in difficult situations (kidnap, ambush, attack). You will emerge a lot wiser about the sort of risks you face and how these can be reduced. Much of the advice will be common-sense, but it will help more than a pistol under the pillow. You will also get a report and recommendations on the next steps. Price for the assessment: Pounds 1,500. Control Risks acts as a one-stop service and will supply bodyguards (budget for around Pounds 300 a day, depending on experience and the job) and the necessary technology (anything from alarms to bullet-proof cars) you might need to keep hold of your life and riches. It is information and not gadgets, firepower or brawn that is key to keeping out of trouble. Business travellers are most at risk, especially when they visit countries where kidnapping is a national past time. Taking the family on holiday to some areas of the world can also expose the super-rich to super-risks. Calling the Foreign Office in London is one way of finding out what dangers lurk abroad, but this is certainly not foolproof. Control Risks has an online database that gives information on security issues in over 70 countries, as well as its own analysts and correspondents who supply information and intelligence. The service is not necessarily foolproof, either, but it is independent. For the super-rich to be super-safe, the most important thing is to adopt the right attitude - to tone down the glow of wealth. This can be difficult: many of the very wealthy have spent their lives clawing their way free of the dullness of being ordinary. They do not want to be ordinary again.</p>

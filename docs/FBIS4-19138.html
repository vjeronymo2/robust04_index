			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Karin Adelmann report: "Bonn Fights Reasons for Flight"] </F>   [Text] Bonn, 12 April -- According to UN estimates, about  100 million people are fleeing from their homes. By the turn of  the millennium the number of refugees may have increased to half  a billion, the International Red Cross fears. Against this  background, Development Minister Carl-Dieter Spranger (Christian  Social Union) presented a concept on "refugee policy within the  framework of development cooperation" on Tuesday [12 April],  which aims at fighting the reasons for flight and at promoting  the chances of returning. The program continues the refugee  concept that was adopted by the Federal Cabinet in September  1990.    "There is an ethical and humane obligation to prevent people  from having to leave their homes against their will," Spranger  said during the presentation of the concept, "and there is an  ethical and humane obligation to help people who are on the  run." However, helping refugees is also important purely from  the point of view of development policy, because the refugees  are mostly the most mobile and energetic part of a population.  They are people who are needed most urgently for the  development of their countries of origin. A program that  provides start-up aid for returnees is aimed especially at  skilled workers so that they can use the skills that they have  developed in Germany in their own country. Thus, jointly  financed loan funds for helping people found a new existence  have been established together with Chile, Eritrea, Turkey,  Slovenia, and Vietnam. In 1993, 505 companies founded by  returnees were supported in Vietnam alone and more than 6,000  jobs were created. This year about 70 million German marks [DM]  are available for this aid to returnees.    In total, the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and  Development (BMZ) spent about DM490 million on refugee-related  measures in 1993. In addition, about DM100 million was spent  within the framework of the European Union. Focal areas of the  BMZ are southeastern Europe and northern Africa, as well as the  regions of the horn of Africa and Afghanistan/Pakistan, which  are particularly affected by refugee crises.    Social Democratic Party of Germany development expert  Ingomar  Hauchler criticized the concept as insufficient. Spranger's  ideas are, in addition, suspected of being a "mere instrument of  isolation" against people.</p>

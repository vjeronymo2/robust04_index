			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION RIGHTS ACTIVISTS RALLY TROOPS IN D. C.  </P> <P> Sheri O'Dell has a burning message to deliver.  </P> <P> Preparing for a massive weekend abortion rights demonstration at which more  than 200,000 persons are expected from nearly every state and six foreign  countries, O'Dell, a National Organization for Women vice president and march  coordinator, says: "We want to deliver a message to all three branches of  government that ain't nobody gonna get away with making abortion illegal  again."  </P> <P> The demonstration, which follows a series of increasingly militant protests by  anti-abortion forces, represents an escalation of political warfare as both  sides try to influence the Supreme Court's pending review of its 1973 Roe vs.  Wade decision legalizing abortion.  </P> <P> Reflecting the intensity of the struggle, an anti-abortion group got a jump on  the planned abortion rights event by setting up a symbolic cemetery Wednesday  on the Washington Mall, within view of Sunday's rally site on the Capitol  grounds.  </P> <P> Ray Allen, president of the American Coalition for Life, said that 4,400 white  wooden crosses planted in the "Cemetery of the Innocents" represent "one day's  abortion death toll in America." After speeches by Rep. Robert K. Dornan  (R-Garden Grove) and other congressmen, the group began a prayer vigil  projected to continue through the weekend.  </P> <P> The National Organization for Women is sponsoring Sunday's demonstration, with  the endorsement of more than 470 national groups, "to show that we who support  keeping abortion safe and legal are the overwhelming majority," according to an  advertising flyer.  </P> <P> "People are coming here to say with their feet and their voices that if the  court tries to overturn Roe vs. Wade," O'Dell said, "they're going to invite  massive civil disobedience and open defiance of the law."  </P> <P> Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action  League, acknowledged that advocates of giving women a choice between abortion  and delivery have been slow to respond to the aggressiveness of the opposition.  </P> <P> As a result, she said, Sunday's demonstration is but the first of many planned  over the next several months "to give the pro-choice majority the ability to  stand up and refuse to be bullied and silent any longer."  </P> <P> Among the hordes streaming into Washington this weekend will be 36 members of  the Hollywood Women's Political Committee, an organization of "the  entertainment industry's most powerful women celebrities and executives,"  according to a press release.  </P> <P> Actresses Glenn Close, Susan Sarandon, Kelly McGillis, Cybill Shepherd and  others will appear at a news conference Saturday with top leaders of the  abortion rights community, including NARAL's Michelman, NOW President Molly  Yard, Planned Parenthood President Faye Wattleton and Voters for Choice board  member Gloria Steinem.  </P> <P> Saturday night, the Hollywood delegation will be well represented at a NARAL  benefit featuring performances by singers Judy Collins and Melissa Manchester,  a reading by novelist Alice Walker, and what Michelman called "an uplifting,  powerhouse film in celebration of women and the reproductive rights movement."  </P> <P> Among others expected to join the delegation are Polly Bergen, Morgan  Fairchild, Whoopi Goldberg, Valerie Harper, Leonard Nimoy, Phil Donahue, Marlo  Thomas and folk-singers Peter, Paul and Mary.  </P> <P> So many people are headed for the capital this weekend -- the annual Cherry  Blossom Festival also will be in swing -- that all hotels are sold out and  numerous churches and private homes are being pressed into service.  </P> <P> "We've got over 1,500 buses coming from as far away as Washington state," NOW's  Sue Mottinger said. "We've got chartered planes because the regular airlines  are filled. A train from Atlanta is picking up people along the way. About 350  colleges are sending formal delegations. We have delegations from France, West  Germany, Canada, Japan, Iceland and Norway."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Braced for Violence  </P> <P> Police forces of the District of Columbia, the National Park Service and  Congress said they are prepared for possible violent confrontations Sunday. But  an official of Operation Rescue, the militant anti-abortion group that has  tried to shut down abortion clinics in Los Angeles, Washington and other  cities, said that no disruptions ("rescues") are planned.  </P> <P> "We will be holding some signs along the parade route and we'll go out to the  cemetery (on the Mall) for a memorial service Sunday. But we are not having any  rescue in the D.C. area," said Jim Backlin, the group's director of  legislation.  </P> <P> Similarly, the National Right to Life Committee is "not planning any type of  counter-activity," said spokesman Leonard Dinegar. "We had our annual march in  January," a reference to the 16th annual March for Life on Jan. 23, which drew  more than 65,000 participants.  </P> <P> During that demonstration, President Bush assailed abortion as a "tragedy" and  called for reversal of Roe vs. Wade. The Supreme Court, with its new  conservative majority, will hear oral arguments April 26 on a Missouri case  that could be used to roll back the landmark decision.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lobbying Opportunity  </P> <P> Many abortion rights activists plan to stay past Sunday and lobby members of  Congress on the stalled equal rights amendment and other women's issues. Among  other things, they seek to liberalize the nearly total ban on federal funding  of abortions for poor women and to restore cuts in family planning aid to  foreign governments.  </P> <P> "I doubt they'll influence the court, but they could have some impact on  Congress," said a source close to Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.), author of the  amendment that bans federal abortion aid except in cases where the mother's  life is endangered. "They may carve out an exception for rape and incest. . . .  Ultimately, the pivotal player will be Bush and his willingness to use the  veto."  </P> <P> NOW's O'Dell said the marchers' major goal is to get in a loud word before the  Supreme Court begins hearing the Missouri case, Webster vs. Reproductive Health  Services.  </P> <P> "Once the lawyers take over, the court closes the door and then nine people in  the smallest precinct in America sit down and vote," she said. "It affects  everybody, especially the half that can get pregnant, and we feel this is our  one shot in the debate."  </P></p>

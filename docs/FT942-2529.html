			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Car-maker's Bitter blow In the heady days of the mid-1980s, I was persuaded to invest in Bitter Corporation, a German company run by one Eric Bitter, engineer extraordinary and maker of the fabulous, up-market Bitter luxury sports car. The last I heard was a curt letter - possibly in 1988 - saying that Bitter shares could now be dealt with on the NASDAQ system in the US. What happened to Bitter? Are the shares still tradeable? Bitter shares are certainly not dealt with on NASDAQ and, as far as we can determine, the company is no longer trading. (Answer by Murray Johnstone Personal Asset Management).

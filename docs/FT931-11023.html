			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / The Property Market: The cause of convertibility - Vanessa Houlder on a report which argues that empty offices should be used for residential accommodation 'London has a glut of empty offices - and not enough homes . . . If one problem could be used to help solve the other, it would provide badly-needed work for the building industry and stave off . . . dereliction.' This declaration of the case for converting offices to housing kicked off a report* that was launched this week by a team of surveyors, architects and analysts. The argument for putting unwanted offices to a better use has long been debated both inside and outside the property industry. The idea has now been seized upon by politicians. 'Where it is feasible, practicable and possible, I shall do what I can to support such a transition (from offices to other uses),' said Sir George Young, housing minister, at the launch. Last month, environment secretary Michael Howard said: 'We are now seeing an increasing number of applications for change from offices to residential use on both sites and existing buildings. I want to encourage these trends.' And this week Mr Charles Hendry, the Conservative MP for High Peak and chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Homelessness, took up the issue by calling for new initiatives 'to tackle the scandal of empty offices. 'The tragedy of this situation is that there are 30m sq ft of offices in London, and millions more in other cities, lying empty and gradually decaying, when there are tens of thousands of people in need of accommodation,' he said. The politicians' pleas have not fallen on deaf ears. Empty office blocks, owned privately and by local authorities, have been converted into hostels for use by the destitute; and a campaign by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors to use empty space above shops for flats has been endorsed by the retail industry. In a recent CSW/Gallup poll, four out of five of the industry's top 100 managers said that planning authorities should allow the conversion of empty commercial space to residential use. But the obstacles facing such conversions are substantial. There are few successful examples of conversions. Plantation Wharf in Battersea, south London, where the receivers have turned the half-finished central office tower into flats, is a notable exception. Some of the problems facing office conversions are insuperable. Physically, many buildings, particularly the high-tech, glass-walled buildings that were built during the period of hectic construction activity in the 1980s, are generally ill-suited for conversion; windows in such buildings do not open, and their huge floor areas mean that too much of the floor space is too far from windows. The buildings that best lend themselves to conversion are the grey, slab office blocks built in the 1960s and 1970s, for which demand is currently poor. Many unoccupied commercial properties are also in office ghettos, which would not adapt well to residential use. The Empty Homes Agency, which was set up last year to address the possibilities of converting vacant buildings to residential use, says the close proximity of restaurants, post offices and other community services often determines whether a building is a good candidate for conversion. Some of the problems facing conversions could be alleviated. Local authorities, for example, are often reluctant to relinquish sites that they have earmarked for uses that could generate jobs. Campaigners such as Mr Hendry would like to see local authorities grant temporary residential consent. This would allow developers to keep their options open if demand for offices revives. Granting temporary residential planning permission could also assuage the fear of developers, who are often reluctant to sacrifice hard-won office consents. Planning permission for office use has historically been far more valuable than permission for residential use. Also, temporary residential planning permission may provide some assurance to property owners who are reluctant to convert their offices to housing because they fear the premises would deteriorate after a period of residential use. 'The government could help in producing booklets which show how conversions can be carried out and the buildings kept in good order, to give reassurance to the owners,' says Mr Hendry. Another concern for the advocates of conversions is that property owners are deliberately vandalising their own empty buildings to avoid paying rates. The effect of this self-inflicted vandalism is that buildings that could be used for housing are made uninhabitable. Yet the biggest question mark over the viability of converting offices to houses is financial. At present, the numbers rarely add up. An appraisal of four central London schemes by surveyors Cluttons and Gardiner &amp; Theobald found that converting a building to residential use was far more profitable than if the premises were retained for office use, with profits often up to 15 per cent higher. However, this profit was more than wiped out when value added tax - which is payable for work on office buildings - is taken into account. As VAT is not incurred on the construction of a residential building, developers find it can be more profitable to pull a building down and start again. The enthusiasts for office-housing conversions argue that if house prices recover and office values continue to plunge, the economics of converting will become more attractive. Already, in certain circumstances - where developers have pre-let the accommodation and conversion costs are low - schemes are viable. Housing associations and universities looking for student accommodation are the most important sources of demand for conversions. In London, more than a dozen colleges are looking for some 50,000 sq ft each for student hostels, according to Applied Property Research, which produced the Home Office report. Planning applications for change of use are being lodged at a rate of three to four a week. In any event, the conversion of existing office blocks to housing is unlikely to prove a panacea for the huge expanse of empty office space in London, which is equivalent to 25 Canary Wharf towers. Mr Hendry puts the predicament starkly: 'Unless action is taken to find new uses for them (unwanted offices), we will see dereliction on a scale we have not witnessed since the blitz.' * The Home-Office Report by Applied Property Research, Cluttons, Gardiner &amp; Theobald and GMW; price Pounds 37 from the Publishing Business, 27 John Adam Street, London WC2N</p>

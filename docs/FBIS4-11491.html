			<p>BFN     [Text] Quito, 26 Apr (EFE) -- The first day of a two-day  strike against the privatization plans of the Ecuadoran  Government headed by conservative Sixto Duran-Ballen resulted in  blocked roads and minor incidents in the countryside and cities  that left several people injured, four of them by gunfire.    Government spokesmen admitted that the unions and Indian and  peasant organizations which supported the strikes caused the  intermittent closure of some roads but stressed that public  forces rapidly reopened them. The spokesmen did not say if  there were any clashes.    According to reports from radio and television stations and  human rights organizations, four peasants are in serious  condition after being shot by soldiers who were trying to  unblock a road near the port of Guayaquil, Ecuador's most  congested city. Another person was injured when he was struck by  a tear gas canister, according to information from the  Ecumenical Human Rights Commission (CEDHU).    Teachers and students also participated in the national  strike even though the government had suspended classes at  schools and colleges throughout the country to prevent  disturbances.    Government reports of strike observance in the electricity,  telephone, fuel, and social and medical security sectors  differed from more radical reports by the "Defense of  Sovereignty and Anti-Privatization Front," [Frente de Defensa de  la Soberania y Contra las Privatizaciones], the organization  that organized the strikes.    A Public Communication Secretariat communique containing a  city by city strike report said there were only a few protests.  As of 1800 (2300 GMT), the protests had not included power or  telephone service cuts, a possibility voiced by some strike  leaders.    Evening newspaper headlines read: "War on Privatization,"  "Roads Militarized," "Roads Blocked," "Bureaucrats, Indians, and  Teachers Paralyze Country," and "Protests." Radio and television  stations reported that many public institutions that could be  affected by privatization are on strike. Platoons of soldiers  and police are patrolling the principal cities and national  roads and are guarding gas stations and public offices.    Ecuadoran Government Minister Marcelo Santos said the strike  is being encouraged by "a tired union leadership that confuses  state modernization with massive dismissals." He added that  "the modernization process cannot be postponed or renounced."  Santos said public security forces "have coordinated to ensure  security, peace, and normalcy for those who wish to work."    Carlos Larreategui, secretary general of public  administration, said the government will not allow the country  to be paralyzed by these two days of protests, which are  occurring only five days before the legislative, municipal, and  provincial elections on 1 May. Larreategui said the government  could impose "administrative and even criminal sanctions" on the  strike leaders, but he ruled out the possibility of decreeing a  state of emergency.</p>

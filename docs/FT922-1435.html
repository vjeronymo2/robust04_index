			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Iran seeks silken ties with its Central Asian neighbours: Emphasis placed on trade revival and extension of transport networks to gain regional influence WHEN President Hashemi Rafsanjani last month inaugurated work on a railway between Iran and neighbouring Turkmenistan, an enthusiastic Iranian press portrayed it as one more example of links being forged between Iran and its Central Asian neighbours. Mr Rafsanjani reminded his audience in the north-eastern city of Mashhad that the railway would provide a link between landlocked Central Asia and the 'open seas through the southern border of Iran,' also forming a 'bridge' between Europe and Asia. The Turkmenistan railway is not the only transport project used by Iran to capitalise on its proximity to the Central Asian republics. Tehran recently announced that it plans to spend Dollars 2.5bn upgrading and extending a railway line from the Caspian Sea to the Gulf. The main work left to be done is to extend an existing line from the town of Sari in northern Iran to the Caspian port of Freydun Kenar. Both this port and Bandar Abbas on the Gulf will have to be expanded significantly to cope with an estimated 5m to 8m tonnes of freight annually. Iran clearly regards its ability to facilitate trade to and from the newly-emergent states as a key card in the evolving competition for power and influence in the region. Six former Soviet republics - Kirgizia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan - plus Iran, Turkey and Pakistan, recently gathered for a summit in Ashkhabad, the capital of Turkmenistan, and intriguingly, called for moves to re-open the Silk Road. This ancient route, stretching some 6,400km from China through South and Central Asia, including what is now Iran, to the Levant, was pioneered in the second century BC, and was one of the principal conduits for the transport of silk to the Roman empire. Iranian behaviour regarding its neighbours has thus far been exemplary, diminishing initial fears that Iran would seek to export its own potent brand of Islamic fundamentalism to the unsettled Moslem states following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Western officials in Tehran cite Iran's efforts to mediate an end to the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan in Nagorno-Karabakh and its role in trying to calm the situation in Afghanistan as indications of its desire to be seen as a positive force. 'Iran is not going to play the Islamic card all that vigorously,' said one official. 'Iran is worried about the enormous power vacuum to its north, and it will not wish to further destabilise the situation. What worries Iran is that ethnic conflict will filter down to Iran itself.' About half Iran's population of 58m are ethnic minorities, including big concentrations of Kurds and Azeris in its northern regions. In spite of the conventional view that Iran's intentions are fairly benign in the states to its north, it would be naive to believe that the country's theocratic leadership does not harbour ambitions to use religion as a means of enhancing Iran's regional influence. 'Given the role of the Islamic republic of Iran in the region, our responsibilities are manifold,' Mr Ali Akbar Velayati, Iran's foreign minister, said recently. 'Iran shares the Islamic heritage with her neighbouring countries, and, in view of the recent urge for independence in Central Asia, it has to fill the existing cultural and economic vacuum in the region. Hence, all countries that seek Iran's assistance in these realms will be welcomed.' It is this sort of observation and a challenging description by Mr Rafsanjani of the putative Economic Co-operation Organisation, grouping all the states of Central Asia plus Iran, Pakistan and Turkey, as 'one great Moslem family', 250m strong, that troubles the west and the US in particular. Iran's response to the collapse early in May of the conservative government in Farsi-speaking Tajikistan (Farsi is the language of Iran) was also hardly encouraging as far as western observers were concerned. Tehran Radio hailed the triumph of the 'Moslem people of Tajikistan' who were now engaged most importantly in a 'renovation' of their 'Islamic, national identity.' Mr William Taft, the US ambassador to Nato, observed recently that the situation in Central Asia was fragile, and it was therefore very important for the US to work closely with Turkey to ensure that the 'Turkish model' prevails over the Iranian one. Turkey, which has offered the Central Asian republics some Dollars 1.2bn in credits, is fairly confident that it has the upper hand in the battle for hearts and minds. In this, Turkey is being aided by the fact that Turkic is the predominant language in the region and most people are Sunni Moslems, the less confrontational form of Islam practised in Turkey and in the Arab world. But in a volatile situation no one can be sure how things will evolve, and Iran, although constrained by its own deep economic problems and the huge burden of post-war reconstruction, remains something of a wild card. In Tehran, a Turkish official likened Central Asia to a laboratory. 'We don't know what effect the various compounds will ultimately produce,' he said. 'These people are going from communism to what? They have no real understanding of democracy. As far as Turkey is concerned we want to co-operate with Iran, rather than compete. These countries need so much help.'</p>

The Sudan diplomat stated during the meeting that the people he  represents respect the Moldovan people's choice expressed on  February 27th. He called this "a choice to erect a democratic,  independent and sovereign state." Snegur pointed out that  Moldova has overcome a series of difficulties inherent in the  transition to a market economy, mentioning the stability of the  national currency and reduction of inflation. According to  Snegur, Moldova's foreign policy will be founded on certain laws  that will be examined and adopted in the near future.

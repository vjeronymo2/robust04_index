Offical figures show that last year the province approved  more than 10,000 overseas-funded firms, involving a total  investment of more than nine billion U.S. dollars, doubling the  figures for the previous year.    Located in the Chang Jiang River Delta, a priority area of  development in China, Jiangsu has been ranking first in total  industrial and agricultural output value among all provinces in  the country. A total of more than 18,000 overseas-funded firms  have been established here by businesses from 85 countries and  regions in the world.    Statistics show that the scale of overseas investment has  been on the rise. More than 700 foreign-invested projects have  been capitalized with more than 10 million U.S. dollars each.  Some 60 leading international companies from the United States,  Japan and the Netherlands have made investment in Jiangsu.    Meanwhile, in major cities like Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou  60  percent of the big state-owned enterprises have now introduced  foreign investment.    The areas where foreign investment went to have also been  expanded. Officials from the provincial department in charge of  investment affairs said that most of the overseas investment has  been concentrated in the ten national development zones in the  province. But all counties and almost every township have  introduced overseas investment.    Investment has poured into such fields as basic industries,  infrastructures, the service sector and high technology. Since  the beginning of the 1990s, foreign investors have shown great  interest in the province's construction of highways, ports,  bridges, airports and energy projects.    The officials also noted that in recent years more and more  Taiwanese businesses have invested in the province. Official  statistics show that to date, the province has approved more  than 3,800 firms with Taiwan investment, involving a total  contractual funds of over four billion U.S. dollars. Big  projects with at least 10 million U.S. dollars have exceeded 100.</p>

That proposal was preempted by the development of a new very high frequency omni-directional range (VOR) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) to Runway (RWY) 17. The legal description of the proposed airspace in the notice of proposed rulemaking was incomplete. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate controlled airspace for aircraft executing the recently established VOR RWY 17 SIAP at Hondo, TX. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received on or before January 20, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Send comments on the proposal in triplicate to Manager, System Management Branch, Air Traffic Division, Federal Aviation Administration Southwest Region, Docket No. 92&hyph;ASW&hyph;34, Fort Worth, TX 76193&hyph;0530. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The official docket may be examined in the Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Federal Aviation Administration, Southwest Region, 2601 Meacham Boulevard, Room 663, Fort Worth, TX, between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.

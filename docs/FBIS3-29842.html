Rice imported from China is also fetching similar prices as  both Chinese and California rice are close in taste to the  medium short- grain Japanese staple, according to Beikoku Data  Bank, a private market research agency.    Earlier this month, the government began selling rice  imported from China, Thailand and the United States to cope with  a shortfall caused by a poor harvest last year.    Thai rice, a long-grain variety, has proven less popular  with  the Japanese.    According to Beikoku Data Bank, Thai rice is traded at 70-90  yen per kilogram on distribution channels outside official  markets, way below the 199 yen at which the government sold the  product to wholesalers.    Faced with the unpopularity of Thai rice, the Food Agency  has  said it will begin selling a blend of rice imported from China,  the U.S. and Thailand.</p>

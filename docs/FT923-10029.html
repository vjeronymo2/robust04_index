			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Pick-a-mix for Pep investors INVESTORS holding investment or unit trust Personal Equity Plans can now mix non-qualifying with qualifying trusts after a rethink of the rules. Non-qualifying trusts are those that do not commit themselves to holding at least 50 per cent of their investments in European Community equities. The Inland Revenue this week clarified the rules governing non-qualifying trusts. Before the Budget, Pep investors were allowed to put Pounds 1,500 in a non-qualifying trust or Pounds 3,000 in a qualifying trust. Those who wanted to invest the full annual Pep limit of Pounds 6,000 had to make up the balance in individual equities. Chancellor Norman Lamont raised the limits on investment in both unit and investment trusts from a maximum of Pounds 3,000 to the Pounds 6,000 limit for equities in the Budget. However, the rules did not seem to allow Pep holders to mix qualifying with non-qualifying trusts in one Pep. To do this, the Pep holder would have to go through a laborious and costly process of first subscribing to a non-qualifying trust up to Pounds 1,500 and placing the remaining Pounds 4,500 in equities - then selling the equities and replacing them with qualifying trusts. Pep holders who invest up to Pounds 1500 in a non-qualifying trust can now can now make up the Pounds 4,500 balance with a qualifying trust, equities, or a mixture of both. 'Investors who want a broader spread can now mix and match non-qualifying trusts with qualifying, without the complications of first investing in other equities and then switching,' said Fiona Monro of the Association of Investment Trust Companies. Julian Shersby of the Unit Trust Association also welcomed the news: 'It widens the choice for investors. Very few of our members were promoting their non-UK/Europe unit trusts but I would expect them to start doing so now.' Investment trust companies are continuing to lobby for all investment trusts to qualify for the full Pounds 6,000 a year. The large international general trusts are one of the most stable and diversified sectors in the investment trust industry. Jeremy Tigue of Foreign &amp; Colonial, the UK's largest investment trust, with six of its eight investment trusts classified as non-qualifying, called the simplification of the Pep rules this week 'half a loaf'. 'It is still very frustrating to have the Pounds 1,500 limit.'</p>

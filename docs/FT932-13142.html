			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Bulls manage to jump hurdle at third attempt - The Australian market There was no cheering, but there were plenty of sighs of relief among brokers on Friday night after the Australian All Ordinaries index found sufficient strength to end the week above 1,700. It was a close run thing. In the end, the index closed 2.8 points down on the day, at 1702.6. But it could have been worse: no less than three bull runs in the last 18 months have failed at the 1,700 hurdle. It is unclear whether the breaching of the barrier presages a sufficiently strong rally to take the index back to its peak of 2,300 achieved on the eve of the 1987 global stock markets crash. Most observers think not; at least not yet. Nevertheless, the All Ordinaries is now 29 per cent above its end-1987 level, and 9.8 per cent above its close at the end of last year. The improvement has been across the board. Eighteen of the 23 sectoral indices showed an improvement over the 12 months to the end of March, compared with just three in the year to December, and 10 in the end-February year. Clearly, the recovery is broadening as it gathers pace. And there are plenty of other reasons to be cheerful about the future. The market did not like the surprise re-election of Mr Paul Keating's Labor government on March 13 - the All Ordinaries dropped 35 to 1,626.4 on the first trading day after the poll. But the retreat was temporary, and there is little doubt that the election has eased the political uncertainty which was holding the market back. Recovery from the 18 month recession in 1990/91 has been painfully slow, but the economy grew by 0.7 per cent in the December quarter, and by 2.5 per cent over the year. This is not fast enough to bring unemployment down much from the present 10.9 per cent, but it is faster than in than most other OECD countries. The government has made clear that growth is its top priority over the next three years, and a further fiscal stimulus is possible in an attempt to reinforce the effects of earlier increases in public spending. The scope for manoeuvre is limited by the government's need to rein in the budget deficit, but the target of 1 per cent of GDP by 1997/97 is sufficiently far away to allow a further stimulus in the August budget, provided a credible plan for future deficit reduction is announced. The overall macro-economic background is generally favourable. The Australian currency has also staged a recovery in recent weeks after weakening significantly last year. A further cut in official interest rates will depend on the outlook for inflation remaining favourable, but the Reserve Bank is unlikely to regard the currency as a constraint if it decides to move. Significantly, four of the five sectoral indices which have fallen over the least 12 months are directly recession related - building materials, alcohol and tobacco, retail and transport. All could be expected to show solid gains if the pace of recovery increases. (The fifth sector, metals excluding gold, is unlikely to show much improvement until the leading economies show signs of stronger growth.) Confidence is recovering rapidly. The latest survey of Australian industry by Dun &amp; Bradstreet showed that business confidence leapt to a four year high in March, and a report by the Australian Chamber of Manufactures indicated that more than 40 per cent of manufacturing companies expected to increase production in the June quarter. It is also clear that the flood of poor results from leading Australian companies is ebbing, after two years in which black ink has sometimes seemed a rarity. Potter Warburg, the Melbourne stockbrokers, says that net corporate profits, excluding the resources sector, are likely to increase by 15 to 20 per cent this year, compared with a decline in 1992. On the downside, brokers say that concern about the balance of payments and the budget deficit may re-emerge, and demand may be dampened by a slug of flotations and rights issues due over the next 12 months. These will include 75 per cent of Qantas, a further tranche of the Commonwealth Bank, the failed Adsteam group's Woolworths retailing chain, and at least one commercial television network. Perhaps because of these concerns, institutional buyers remain cautious, and many analysts say there is insufficient steam in the present rally to take it much further. 'Our view is that the market will consolidate for a couple of months and then soar to 1,750-1,800 before drifting lower over the course of the year,' says Mr Nigel Purchase, market strategist at Potter Warburg. Mr Josef Rudzyn, technical analyst at JB Were, takes the slightly more bullish view that the All Ordinaries index is heading for the next important test at 1,786, although he expects the market to take 3-5 quarters to get there. Technical and fundamental analysts agree, however, that the market is likely to take some time to move within range of the elusive 1987 all time high. 'The potential is there, but it will take at least three years,' says Mr Rudzyn. 'At this stage, even a bull would not put it much closer than that.'</p>

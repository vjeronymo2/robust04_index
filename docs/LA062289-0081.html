			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SLOW-TO-SELL RANCH OWNERS COULD GET TAX BONANZA  </P> <P> The public reluctance by the owners of Taylor Ranch to sell 465 acres for a new  California State University campus may eventually help them obtain a tax  bonanza of more than $2 million, a survey of legal experts revealed this week.  </P> <P> Virtually assured of the tax windfall, owners of the ranch broke a yearlong  silence this week, disclosing that they are actively negotiating the sale of  their land while fighting to retain some oil-drilling rights.  </P> <P> Prompted by Cal State's clear determination to use eminent domain powers to  seize the ranch for a campus site, a lawyer representing the Taylor Ranch  owners said they are now trying to work out "the best deal possible" with the  state.  </P> <P> "It's no longer a question of whether we are willing to sell," said Santa  Barbara attorney James Hurley, representing Taylor Ranch heiress Cynthia Wood  and other family members. "The state has made it clear they plan to take the  property. In that case, you then try to negotiate or make the best deal you can  for the rest of the ranch."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Primary Concerns  </P> <P> In negotiations with the state, Hurley said, the primary concerns will be in  securing oil-drilling rights on the land, adequate water supplies for the rest  of the ranch, a satisfactory price and environmental safeguards involving the  proximity of oil-drilling operations.  </P> <P> Despite the tax advantages of having opposed a project headed for condemnation,  Hurley said the potential tax benefits were never a consideration in opposing  the campus site.  </P> <P> "Absolutely not," Hurley said. "Our opposition from the start has been made  primarily because of environmental concerns."  </P> <P> While Hurley denied that a tax break was one of the motives for opposing the  Cal State campus site, several leading California lawyers told The Times that  one benefit of the opposition will be a considerable windfall for Taylor  Ranch's owners.  </P> <P> When a state agency moves to acquire private property for public use, they  pointed out, the owners must resist the initial purchase offer to qualify for  tax breaks.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman, one of the leading tax lawyers on the  West Coast, said that if the owners of Taylor Ranch had immediately accepted a  state offer to purchase their land, they would have lost a chance for lucrative  state and federal tax deferments.  </P> <P> Hochman said that if the state pays $7 million for the land, the sum earmarked  for the purchase of the hillside parcel, the owners would have two years to  reinvest tax-free profits in similar property and would never have to pay  capital gains taxes on the profits if they did not resell the new holdings  during their lifetime.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tax Savings  </P> <P> The savings in state and federal capital gains taxes would be $2 million at  that $7-million purchase price if the land had originally cost $1 million,  Hochman said. Assuming that the initial land costs were significantly less, he  said, the savings would be even greater.  </P> <P> The legal insights into the high-stakes tax maneuvers that accompany almost all  major state land acquisitions followed a week of major new developments in Cal  State's continuing quest to acquire the Taylor Ranch site:  </P> <P> * After a unanimous vote by the Ventura City Council rezoning the hillside  parcel for institutional use and encouraging Cal State to proceed with the  project, the university took the first step toward seizing the land by  obtaining authorization of the California Public Works Board for eminent domain  proceedings.  </P> <P> * At the same time, state officials disclosed that constructive negotiations  are in progress that could eliminate the need for eminent domain proceedings  and produce a settlement in the next few months. Hurley's confirmation  followed.  </P> <P> * As Cal State moved closer to acquiring the ranch site, environmental forces  opposed to converting the parcel into a bustling state university site filed a  lawsuit seeking to block the purchase, pending revisions in an environmental  impact report approved by the state last month.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Months of Speculation  </P> <P> The latest flurry of activity and the outside legal assessments of the  economics involved in eminent domain cases came after months of speculation  over why the ranch's owners apparently were determined to resist potential  legal action that almost always results in a successful state seizure.  </P> <P> The Taylor Ranch owners, Wood and her mother and stepfather, Pierre and Ailene  Claeyssens, all of Montecito, have been on record as opposing the sale of the  ranch since June, 1988, although Ventura officials have said Wood initially had  a favorable attitude about selling the property for a university. The family  has owned the ranch since the early 1900s.  </P> <P> In explaining the family's opposition to selling the land, Wood's attorney, J.  Robert Andrews of Santa Barbara, initially cited alleged concerns by Shell Oil  Co., which has oil leases on the ranch, that the presence of a campus could  disrupt oil production and create potential liability problems. Shell  officials, however, denied any opposition to a proposed campus.  </P> <P> Wood's stepfather, Pierre Claeyssens, cited another possible factor in the  family's opposition in revealing last year that his wife had not known of the  plans before her daughter told her of the proposal and was angry that she had  been kept in the dark.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Public Effort  </P> <P> Apart from those explanations, however, Wood and the Claeyssens had made no  public effort to clarify their position in the last year until Hurley's  comments this week.  </P> <P> During recent Ventura City Council hearings on the city's future, several  environmental groups cited the family's opposition to a Cal State campus, but  the actual owners of Taylor Ranch did not speak for themselves.  </P> <P> The tax and land acquisition specialists interviewed this week were careful not  to speculate about possible motives behind the owners' public opposition to the  sale, but they did say that such opposition is virtually required as a legal  posture in other cases to assure landowners the best possible tax advantages.  </P> <P> "You don't have to fight it all the way to court," said Los Angeles attorney  Hodge Dolle Sr., a specialist in eminent domain proceedings. "But to qualify  with the Internal Revenue Service and the State Franchise Board for capital  gains deferral, the sale has to have been in lieu of condemnation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Smart Property Owner'  </P> <P> "In this case, there's obviously a big piece of change involved," he added. "I  would say that's a smart property owner to oppose the sale."  </P> <P> Both Dolle and Loyola University Law School Professor Gideon Kanner, a leading  expert on eminent domain who publishes a monthly periodical titled Just  Compensation, agreed that barring some unforeseen environmental issue there is  little chance that the owners of Taylor Ranch could prevail in any court battle  against Cal State to block condemnation.  </P> <P> "The taking must be for a public use and a university campus is clearly a  public use," Kanner said. "The bottom line is sure, they can get it. It's a  fairly common argument for the owner to say, 'Why me? Take somebody else's  land.' But that doesn't go over very often. In a case like this, there's not  much to talk about."  </P> <P> Kanner stressed that he sees nothing conspiratorial in the objections voiced by  the owners of Taylor Ranch to selling their land, saying that it is normal for  landowners to oppose such acquisition until the time when they realize that it  is inevitable.  </P> <P> "You have the Taylor Ranch sitting up there and one day the government comes  knocking at the door and says we want your ranch," Kanner said. "They say no.  That's a perfectly normal response. Then, maybe later, they come to understand  that there's really not much they can do to stop it. Any agreement at this  point is in lieu of condemnation, and the owners are entitled to the tax  deferments that come with such involuntary sales."  </P> <P> While state officials stopped short this week of saying that they believe the  action of the Public Works Board should satisfy any legal concerns the owners  may have about the certainty of receiving full tax breaks at this stage of the  acquisition process, they called it proof of the state's determination to  acquire the land.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Still Hoping  </P> <P> "I'd say we continue to be hopeful," said Jack Smart, Cal State's vice  chancellor for university affairs. "We are in constructive discussions with the  owners of the property. Assuming successful negotiations, I hope we can  complete discussions by the end of the summer and avoid any further eminent  domain proceedings."  </P> <P> Smart had no comment on the lawsuit filed against the Cal State Board of  Trustees in an effort to block further acquisition activities by the state  pending submission of a revamped environmental impact report.  </P> <P> That suit, filed by the Environmental Coalition on grounds that the initial  environmental impact report is incomplete, charges that Cal State only studied  the potential impact of a two-year campus with 2,000 students, although the  university could ultimately grow to a four-year school with 12,000 students.  </P> <P> The suit, prepared by attorney Philip A. Seymour of the Environmental Defense  Center of Santa Barbara, also charges that state officials did not give critics  adequate time to provide input on key environmental issues, including possible  damage to archeological sites and possible paleontological deposits in the  hillside area.  </P></p>

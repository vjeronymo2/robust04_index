			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Survey of Turkey (5): Slow moves on asset sales - The public deficit is spiralling, but privatisation is being held up TURKISH POLITICIANS rarely discuss the issue with the zeal you find in eastern Europe, or in Argentina where reformed Peronists are now rolling back the frontiers of the state. Today in Ankara, with a coalition government at the helm, the debate about privatisation has been hijacked by bureaucratic infighting, and the opposition of vested business interests, concerned at the growing foreign presence in the country's economy. It has always been easier to make the economic case for the privatisation of Turkey's state-run industries. The state's interests in 235 enterprises, either as the majority shareholder, as an affiliate or a minority partner in a privately-managed concern, are responsible for up to a third of the public sector borrowing requirement, which in 1991 was running at around 12 per cent of GNP. They account for almost half of all fixed investment in Turkey and employ close to half a million people. Mrs Tansu Ciller, the economics minister, has still to convince her cabinet colleagues of the need for swift remedies if Turkey is to contain the spiralling public deficit which is the main cause of the country's 70 per cent rate of inflation. The former Bosphorus University professor seems increasingly estranged from the bureaucrats whose job it is to carry out her policy. The problems have been exacerbated by her public differences with Mr Cavit Caglar, the state minister who has repeatedly challenged her views on the economy. In the eight months since the election, the government has yet to give a clear signal on the issue. The current privatisation programme is centred on the sale of the government's minority stakes in a number of privately managed companies, the details of which were already approved under the last government. While moving ahead, it is little more than a revenue-raising exercise and does nothing to transform the structure and ownership of Turkish industry. Moreover, there are no plans regarding the main lossmakers - the railways, the ports authority, Tek (the power utility), the grain board, the coal corporation and the tobacco and alcohol monopoly. A World Bank report called for a radical restructuring of the state sector. Tusiad, the Turkish businessmen's association, also called for strong action. The Bank suggested that many of the state companies would have to be closed down. Others would be restructured, by selling their distribution and marketing arms. All of the state enterprises needed to be brought under the commercial code to instil the discipline of the market and allow the managers to make decisions about price. Two months ago, in a somewhat desperate gesture, Mrs Ciller asked Peugeot, the French carmaker, to consider locating its new investment in the old mining town of Zonguldak on Turkey's Black Sea coast. However, the French company is expected to stick to its original plan to build the plant near Izmir. The loss-making state-owned Zonguldak coal corporation, with its payroll of close to 50,000 miners, is one of the principal drains on the Turkish exchequer. In April, after several months of exhaustive discussion, the Turkish cabinet cleared the way for the creation of a new body to handle the disposal of state assets. The idea was to put the state enterprises under the control of an independent authority drawn from political but also academic, business and labour circles. The plan was to restructure the companies in preparation for a sale to the public. However, the powers of Toyok, as the agency is known, have been severely curtailed. The council of ministers retains an effective veto on key decisions, such as the closure of plant and staff redundancies and lay-offs. The privatisation programme was launched by the former Motherland party government in 1986. The gains have been modest. Total revenue from the sale of state assets either by public offering, by block share sales or flotations on the Istanbul stock market, comes to less than USDollars 1bn. Turkey's bid to revive the programme has now met with opposition from businessmen, worried at foreign encroachment in a number of key industrial sectors. The problem is in part a practical one. Turkey's infant stock exchange will find it difficult to digest a large-scale flotation of state-owned assets. On the other hand, few Turkish groups are in a position to raise the sort of cash required to buy state shares in block, which is currently the government's favoured method. In the short term, foreigners may prove the only buyers ready to invest. This year, the newly-created Public Participation High Council, the agency entrusted with handling the sale of state assets to the public, expects to raise Dollars 868m. Officials talk of selling off parts of PTT, the Turkish telecommunications monopoly. The government says the company's cable, TV, car telephone and computer networks are earmarked for disposal. Mr Yasar Topcu, minister of transport, has all but ruled out the sale of Turk Hava Yollari (THY). Any early moves to sell off Petrol Offisi, the state's petrol products retailer, and Tupras, the state refineries corporation, have also been put back. Mr Ustun Sanver, head of the high council, says the government may sell some Petrol Offisi gas station outlets. In the case of the refineries, the government is more likely to look for a foreign investor to form a joint venture with the existing plant. In addition to the cement companies, Mr Sanver hopes to raise Dollars 25-27m from the sale of block shares in Polinas Plastik, a packaging producer; Seker Sigorta (insurance); Istanbul Demir Celik, a mining concern; Turk Tractor, an agricultural machinery business; Trakmak, its marketing arm; and Turk Otomotiv, the car parts manufacturer. Several state companies are to be re-offered to the public, after the PPHC rejected earlier bids. These include Ray insurance, Gima department store and Meysu, a fruit juice and food producer. Mr Sanver expect these sales will realise Dollars 28-34m. There are plans for the public offering of the government's remaining 49 per cent of Netas, which is part-owned by Northern Telecom of Canada. Mr Sanver says preparations are under way for the sale of block shares in Teletas, the telecommunications industry; AEG-ETI, the electric transformer maker; Guneysu, the fruit juice producer; Tofas, the Fiat joint venture assembly and its marketing arm; Aksaray Azmi, flour producer and Ankara, the flour and bread producer. In January, Citibank organised the sale of 51 per cent of Ipragaz for Dollars 65m to the French company Primagaz. In March, Sabanci - Turkey's largest industrial conglomerate - paid Dollars 22.5m for an 87 per cent stake in Nigde Cimento, a local cement producer. Cement has become the cause celebre with the French taking a commanding position after the purchase by Societe Ciments Francais (SCF) of five state-owned companies in 1989. Lafarge Coppee, the world's second largest cement producer, and Societe Vicat have also entered the market. It was Mr Suleyman Demirel, the prime minister, who opposed the sale to SCF, arguing it contravened a 1987 law on privatisation as the shares had not first been offered to domestic investors. This month the role of foreign capital is again expected to come under scrutiny when the PPHC offers block shares in a further 11 cement companies. Mr Sanver says the cement sale is open to all investors, local and international. Any hiccup at this stage could badly damage Turkey's privatisation programme.</p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: BRENTWOOD;  </P> <P> PLAN TO LIMIT DEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude has introduced a measure to the City  Council that would preserve the small-shop character of the Brentwood Village  commercial area at Sunset Boulevard and Barrington Avenue by cutting the legal  density in half.  </P> <P> Braude aide Cindy Miscikowski said the proposal is designed to prevent  large-scale development in the area, but she added that "there is no pressing  development we're trying to stop."  </P> <P> Under existing zoning regulations for the 3.6-acre business district, the  maximum allowable square footage for a commercial building is 1 1/2 times the  square footage of the lot. Braude's proposal would set the maximum at 75% of  the square footage of the lot. It will take about a year for the proposal to  wend its way through the city legislative process, Miscikowski said.  </P> <P> A similar measure was enacted recently to protect the Brentwood Country Mart  area at 26th Street and San Vicente Boulevard.  </P></p>

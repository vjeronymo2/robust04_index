			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / French authorities put Islamic suspects into custody The French authorities yesterday placed into custody 77 of the 95 suspected Islamic militants arrested last Tuesday, writes Andrew Jack in Paris. All but one of the 78 people still held until Saturday were taken to one of five prisons across Paris yesterday after being questioned by investigating magistrates. They included French, Algerian, Moroccan and Russian citizens. Seventeen had been released in the last few days. They face charges including acts linked to the planning of terrorism, theft, falsification of documents, undermining the state and breaches of the laws concerning weapons and explosives. The police crackdown last Tuesday - which was primarily in the Paris region  -was the second such large-scale action since the summer, and led to the seizure of arms and forged documents. Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior minister, said the raids followed surveillance of the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), which had a network with branches in Germany, Britain, Italy, the Netherlands and Canada.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Survey of Spain (13): The state needs cash - The background to privatisation moves WHEN they really want to be nasty, which is fairly frequently, Spain's trade unionists accuse Mr Felipe Gonzalez's government of pursuing Thatcherite policies. This a travesty of the truth. The decade of socialist rule in Spain has rolled forward the frontiers of the state, rather than back. Since Mr Gonzalez formed his first government late in 1982, taxation has become punitive and public spending has increased ever year by an average 2.3 per cent over the growth of the GDP. The government has purposefully walked down the welfare state road. Milestones have included substantially increased spending on pensions, where expenditure rose from Pta1,100bn (Dollars 9bn) in 1982 to Pta3,100bn in 1991, and on education, where it went up from 2.5 per cent of the GDP in 1982 to 3.3 per cent in 1991. Nothing could be less Thatcherite than the government's policy towards the trade unions. Legislation during Mr Gonzalez's first term of office significantly increased the power of works committees, formed by shop stewards, in companies and the government is currently sponsoring a strike law in parliament that has been largely drafted by the unions and is virulently opposed by employers. Union hostility towards the government, which is real enough, is in part due to a level of unemployment that has never fallen below 15 per cent during the Socialist decade and has currently climbed back to the 20 per cent level of 1982. It is also a consequence of the rising expectations of society during the boom years of the late 1980s when the rich indubitably got a lot richer. But union pressure ensured that industrial wages rose steeply as well in the fattened calf years. In terms of unit labour costs Spain is now considerably less competitive than it was when Mr Gonzalez came to power. While the Thatcherite epithet was wholly misplaced before, unions may have some justification in using it against the government from now on. Barring the unlikely possibility of a Socialist-Communist party pact after the general elections later this year, Mr Gonzalez, on his own or in coalition with the minority nationalist parties, will be forced to shed at least a few of his social democrat clothes. The drift towards deregulation will be a tidal wave should the centre-right opposition win power. The Partido Popular took a lot of pages from the UK Conservative party book when it debated economic policy at its national congress in February. Privatisations will be a key area in which the diminishing presence of the state may be measured. Outside the think tanks that nurture the Partido Popular there is not much of a privatisation debate going on but this does not seem to bother the government which has already embarked upon an ambitious disposal course. For that matter, Mr Gonzalez's party never clearly formulated a policy before on what the public sector should look like. Repsol, the government-controlled energy group, is to reduce state ownership to below 50 per cent through a public share offering next month and this placement will be followed, before the summer, by one in which Argentaria, the wholly state-owned banking corporation, will place 25 per cent of itself on the market. If market conditions are right Tabacalera, the government's tobacco monopoly, could also make a share offering before the year is out that will reduce public ownership in the business to below the 50 per cent level. There are at least three reasons for the rush to privatise by Mr Gonzalez's team but the ideal of people's capitalism is not one of them. Nor have the governing socialists been suddenly converted to the idea that private enterprise is better at running businesses. In all the planned disposals the state will continue to be the dominant shareholder. EC deregulatory directives are a consideration but the most important motive is that the government, which is intent on reducing the budget deficit and yet faces increasing social security costs as the recession begins to bite, needs cash. The treasury could raise more than Dollars 2bn this year from share issues. A third reason is that privatisation is no longer an English eccentricity: it has become a European fad. Mr Francisco Luzon, Argentaria's chairman, boasted last month that Spain was jumping ahead of France and Italy in the queue to reach global investors. If Mr Felipe Gonzalez is largely pursuing privatisation by default, the Partido Popular has embraced the strategy with wholesome conviction. Mr Jose Maria Aznar, the opposition leader, who wants to bring down taxes and reduce the budget deficit, says a centre-right government will sell everything it possibly can. The Partido Popular's apparent disavowal of state intervention and of the paternalism that traditionally framed Spanish conservative thinking is a key political development. At its national congress the centre-right party also adopted, not without a certain amount of controversy, a policy called Administracion Unica or Single Administration, that was proposed by Mr Manuel Fraga, the veteran conservative who founded the party and who now runs the Galicia, the autonomous region of north-west Spain. The principle behind the policy is not unlike that of subsidiarity in the EC. Mr Fraga broadly proposes to eliminate the duplication between Madrid's central administration and those of the autonomous communities. The plan is a blueprint for meaningful devolution to the regions and in one way or another the Madrid government is going to have address this issue during the rest of the 1990s. Whether this will mean rolling back state frontiers or simply reinforcing them at a mini-state level is another matter.</p>

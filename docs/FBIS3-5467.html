(Posco), the world's No. 2 steel maker, Tuesday's selection  of an outsider as chairman marked a first in its 20-odd-year  history and came as a great surprise. Because of a conflict of  interest between Chairman Chong Myong-sik and President Cho  Mal-su that surfaced in January as well as the company's  expansion into the cellular phone industry as the largest  shareholder of the new Mobile Telecommunications Co., a top  management reshuffle had long been expected. Nevertheless, the  selection of an outsider as top manager caught nearly everyone  off guard.    The outsider is former Deputy Prime Minister and Economic  Planning Minister Kim Man-chae. A company boasting 12 trillion  won (15 billion U.S. dollars) in assets, 7 trillion won in sales  and 2.5 billion dollars in exports is now under his leadership.    Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Kim Chol-su, who  represents the government as the controlling shareholder of  Posco, said he believes the new chairman is the right man to  reform Posco's management in line with the Kim Yong-sam  government's economic and industrial policy because he knows the  policy better than anybody. Indeed, Posco Chairman Kim headed a  team of economic advisers to President Kim during his  presidential campaign.    Minister Kim thus suggested that Kim was selected as Posco's  new chairman at the recommendation of Chongwadae [presidential  office]. In other words, he became the steel maker's top manager  due to the strong confidence Chongwadae places in him.    Asked about the new chairman's lack of experience in company  management, Minister Kim pointed to his chairmanship of Samsung  Life Insurance Co., adding there is no firm rule that a steel  man must become the top manager of a steel firm. His broad  economic knowledge and sharp insight into international affairs  will make him a good company manager. Moreover, his drive and  experience as the government's chief economic policy-maker make  him the most qualified man for Posco's top post, Minister Kim  said.    After losing in a previous parliamentary election, Kim has  served as chief Korean delegate to the eminent persons' group of  the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, director of the U.S.  East-West Center in Hawaii, member of the Korea-U.S. Wisemen  Committee and chairman of the Korea Foundation for the  handicapped.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political </F> adviser to PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, in Tunis, by Sa'id  Mu'addi, in the studio, date not given; from the "With the  Midday Events" program--recorded]    [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, currently in Tunis, good  evening.    [Sha'th] Good evening.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Sha'th, what is your initial reaction to the  government's decision to release approximately 1,000 detainees  and prisoners from the West Bank and Gaza Strip?    [Sha'th] Naturally, one wants freedom for all his fellow  citizens and people. We have worked determinedly at the table  of negotiations to secure the release of all Palestinian  detainees and not to keep any of our children in prisons and  detention camps. This is a duty that we must pursue. When any  citizen is released, this means that freedom has been restored  to a human being who has suffered gravely. However, as you  know, this move is one of the results of this horrendous  massacre which claimed many lives in the Ibrahimi Mosque in  Hebron. I believe that besides releasing those detainees, many  things must be done in order to safeguard our people and prevent  the recurrence of such dreadful massacres.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, you are taking part in the PLO  leadership's consultations. Are there final decisions?    [Sha'th] The meetings are continuing tonight. They have been  going on for two days. This is because the incident was so  grave and the responsibility is so heavy. We should continue  work to provide protection for our Palestinian people.  Therefore, the final results of these meetings will not appear  before the end of tonight.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, what is the PLO leadership's trend  regarding the resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations?    [Sha'th] This is one of the important questions which we  must  decide tonight. Russian President Yeltsin has sent a high-level  envoy. He asked us to await his arrival before arriving at our  final decision. We will respect this wish. We are waiting to  meet with this envoy before we arrive at results, especially  with regard to the negotiations. Naturally, we do not want to  halt the peace process, which will eventually bring about  Israeli withdrawal and freedom for our people. However, we are  fully aware that important, sufficient, and necessary guarantees  must be provided for the peace process. We are responsible for  our people and for their freedom, security, and protection.  This makes the decision difficult and guarantees necessary.    [Mu'addi] When will the Palestinian delegation leave for  Washington for talks with the U.S. Administration on the  resumption of the negotiations?    [Sha'th] Soon. I believe that what is required now is to  hold consultations with the U.S. Administration to provide these  guarantees. As I have already mentioned, there will also be  consultations with the Russian Government. There are other  consultations with the Arab, European, and other world  governments. What is required, effectively, is to have the  international community assume its responsibility and to agree  on measures for the protection of the peace process through  providing security for our people.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, one last question. Israel has agreed in  principle on the presence of international observers in Jericho  and Gaza. What is your comment?    [Sha'th] This is an important move. It is referred to in the  Declaration of Principles [DOP], which we signed in Washington.  The DOP provides for a temporary international presence.  Naturally, we want any international presence to be only  temporary; that is, until withdrawal is completed, the  Palestinian police assume their responsibilities, and until we  reach a solution that ensures security and peace for all sons of  our people. Therefore, this move is necessary and important.  It must provide the minimum level of protection. The other  point, which is equally important, is the removal of the causes  which led to this odious crime, primarily those settlers who  carry weapons and open fire wherever they go. These are two very  important conditions for providing protection and for the  prevalence of security and stability so that the peace process  can maintained.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, currently in Tunis, thank you  very much.    [Sha'th] Thank you, brother. Thank you.</p>

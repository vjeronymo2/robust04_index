			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Bring Up New Hands With a Firm </F> Faith"]    [Text] It has been 30 years since the Defense Ministry  named the "Steely Eighth Company of the Nanhai Outpost." Thirty  years have passed, things have changed, and so have generations  of officers and men, but the "Steely Eighth Company" has always  retained a steel-like style and discipline. During the period  of reform and opening up, in particular, their spirit of  arduously pioneering a cause and of being self-sacrificing, as  well as their might, indomitable spirit, and unstained character  make them an even brighter and more eye-catching banner of our  Army. With what was that good steel -- the Steely Eighth  Company -- tempered? It was tempered with a firm faith: the  communist faith. This is a valuable experience worthy of  serious study by all walks of life in the great practice of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics.    "Having a firm faith" is a principle to which our party  always adheres in the course of party building. It is also a  principle by which the Army should build itself. During the  extremely formidable revolutionary struggle, it enabled our  party and Army to have an indomitable spirit and strict  discipline, and it united the people to triumph over innumerable  difficulties and dangers. Comrade Deng Xiaoping summed it up,  saying: "In our arduous struggle over the past decades, we have  relied on a firm faith to unite the people to struggle for their  own interests. Without such a faith, there would have been no  rallying force. Without such a faith, there would have been  nothing."    "A firm faith" is still the soul of the party and the Army  during the booming period of reform and opening up. Only by  having a firm faith can our party and Army retain their inherent  qualities, carry forward the glorious tradition of arduous  struggle, and unite the people for the realization of the "four  modernizations."    It is the most basic requirement for the new "four have's"  people to "have a firm faith." Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "By  saying that the factor of mankind is important, we do not mean  ordinary men, but those who have a firm faith, are aware of the  people's interests, and struggle for them." Today, reform has  already entered the stage where key problems are being tackled,  and interest relationships have been readjusted considerably.  At this critical moment, we demand all the more that large  numbers of officers and men like the "Steely Eighth Company"  have a firm faith in their hearts, be willing to make selfless  sacrifices, and act as a guide to society regarding the outlook  one should have on tribulation, happiness, and values.    At the present stage, as far as the broad masses are  concerned, fostering a firm communist faith is a question of  vigorously promoting and strengthening education. For Communist  Party members and the officers and men of the People's Army,  however, it is a question of discipline. This is determined by  the nature, aim, and tasks of our party and Army. They must  keep the communist faith in mind at all times, and must  encourage and spur themselves on to have a deeper understanding  of the people's interests. The reason the "Steely Eighth  Company" can staunchly pioneer a cause in the face of  difficulties and adversities, can remain untempted in the face  of money worship and hedonism, and can be willing to stand guard  duty for foreign-invested enterprises, is that they realize they  are the servicemen of the people, and the builders of the  communist abode. Therefore, they consider it a steely discipline  to arduously pioneer a cause and to be self-sacrificing.    In order to foster new hands with a firm faith, it is  necessary first to educate young people, including young  officers and men, with lofty ideals and a sense of discipline.  For one thing, they are a main force in the modernization drive  and are the hope of achieving our goals down the centuries. If  they have no faith, no ideals, and no discipline, it will be  difficult for them to take up heavy responsibilities, and it  also will be impossible for use to achieve socialist  modernization. On the other hand, the money worship, hedonism,  and ultra-individualism existing in society always have young  people as the main object of their seduction. If we do not  stress ideals and discipline, corrupt and decadent things will  seize the opportunity to take over and probably will interfere  greatly with the pace of our advance.    Education in faith and ideals is an advantage in our party's  ideological and political work. Our Army has a wealth of  experience in this respect, such as "education illustrated with  history" and "passing on experience, giving help, and setting an  example to new hands." They are not only clear-cut systems, but  are also vivid and dramatic. The practice of the "Steely Eighth  Company" shows that as long as we activate our minds, the form  of education in faith and ideals will be rich and colorful,  meaningful and wonderful scenes can be seen everywhere  throughout the Army and the country, and heroic achievements  during the new period and the experiences of ideological and  political work will be carried forward to a great extent and  will blossom everywhere.</p>

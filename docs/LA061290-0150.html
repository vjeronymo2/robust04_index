			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PARRISH HOMER ADDS TO DAVIS' DISAPPOINTMENT  </P> <P> Anything could have happened, Mark Davis was saying.  </P> <P> "He could have popped it up," he said.  </P> <P> But Lance Parrish did not pop it up. He knocked Davis' two-out, ninth-inning  fastball out of the park Monday night, giving the Angels a 3-2 victory over the  Kansas City Royals and giving the Royals their seventh consecutive loss.  </P> <P> Davis would like to believe that he is close to breaking out of the form that  has been a painful disappointment this season, both for him and the team that  is paying him $13 million over four years, the team that viewed his 44 saves  for the Padres last year as the final piece to the Royals' puzzle.  </P> <P> "I felt I was throwing the ball good tonight," Davis said. "He hit it well. He  had to take the ball out of the park to beat me, and he did it."  </P> <P> With that, Davis took his third loss of the season against one victory. He has  five saves.  </P> <P> Mike Macfarlane, the Royals' catcher, and John Wathan, the manager, both agreed  with Davis.  </P> <P> They thought he had good stuff.  </P> <P> "We really felt Mark Davis threw the ball pretty well," Wathan said. "He got  beat by one pitch. He hit it well, to the deepest part of the field. When he  first hit it, I thought it was just a fly ball."  </P> <P> It wasn't, of course.  </P> <P> "Everybody is rooting so hard for Davis, every time he goes out there," Wathan  said. "Just as he seems to be getting the good innings he needs to build his  confidence, something like this happens to take him down a peg."  </P> <P> Those who have watched Davis this season agreed that this is the best he has  looked in some time.  </P> <P> Before Monday, he last pitched Friday at Oakland, retiring the two batters he  faced. But he has blown three of his last four save opportunities, and is five  for nine overall. For the most part, he has come in as a middle reliever, with  no save opportunity.  </P> <P> This time, he came on in the eighth, with Tom Gordon leaving the game with a  muscle strain below his right elbow.  </P> <P> In the ninth, he struck out Chili Davis and Dave Winfield, and was working on  Parrish.  </P> <P> But it was Parrish who got the job done.  </P> <P> The Royals would like to believe that they are close to turning the corner on  what has become a wretchedly disappointing season. But such a thing is hard to  say with conviction from 16 games behind the Oakland Athletics, who swept the  Royals in Oakland over the weekend.  </P> <P> For the second day in a row, one run came between the Royals and the other  team. Oakland beat them, 3-2, Sunday. The Angels, once expected to stand  toe-to-toe together with Kansas City in challenging Oakland, did the same to  the Royals Monday.  </P> <P> "They're the type of losses you want to look at positively if you can," said  Davis. "If you dwell on it, it will only bring you down."  </P> <P> The Royals are in the middle of a stretch of 13 games against the A's and the  Angels, and that alone is bringing them down.  </P> <P> "We wanted to do well on our home stand and then continue that on the road,"  Davis said. "We haven't played the way we wanted to. We have to come back and  battle as hard as we can. We battled, but they did the thing they needed to do  to beat us. There's not much you can do about that."  </P> <P> Today, they try again.  </P> <P> "Tomorrow I want to be able to throw the same type of stuff I did today," Davis  said.  </P></p>

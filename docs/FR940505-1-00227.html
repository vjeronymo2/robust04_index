			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The certifier would perform all actions necessary to bring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the engine to the certified configuration before issuing a useful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> life renewal certificate. Necessary actions may range from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement of selected emission control and other hardware to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> major engine overhaul. Anyone able to meet the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the program may certify an engine configuration and issue useful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> life renewal certificates. EPA would anticipate that candidates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for certifiers would most likely be the original engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers, parts suppliers, and engine rebuilders. Once a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> useful life renewal certificate is issued to the vehicle owner,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the certifier assumes all of the manufacturer's liability for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions performance of the engine as described in the proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for new engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The marketplace, rather than EPA, should develop the most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost effective methods of ensuring effective emissions control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for each engine. Engine rebuilding may not be necessary in all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases. Some engine manufacturers may elect to provide a longer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original useful life. By extending the useful life, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer would allow owners to use their vehicles for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longer period of time without incurring the additional cost of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine rebuild. The Agency believes that there will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant market demand for longer useful life periods, that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more closely match actual in-use engine rebuild practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The original engine manufacturer or another party may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> able to provide a useful life renewal certificate upon the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance of some specified maintenance on the vehicle. Such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance would include anything that was needed to bring the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine to a certified configuration and ensure emissions control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the specified useful life renewal period, possibly including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the replacement of emissions control devices. There are likely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be other possible options for the vehicle owner that EPA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As previously mentioned, the vehicle owner must be in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with these requirements at all times. Enhanced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines without valid useful life certificates may not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registered in California. At time of registration, the owner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be required to show either that the engine was still within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its original useful life or a useful life renewal period. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certifier would be required to provide a certificate to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle owner (as described above) and label the engine, allowing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such a demonstration to be made easily. The label must include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information identifying the certificate, and the effective and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expiration dates (mileages and/or hours as applicable) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> useful life renewal certificate as applied to the labeled engine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, if the vehicle owner is found to be out of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance through a roadside check or other means, EPA would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider the owner to be in violation of federal tampering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions (see section 203(a) of the Clean Air Act) and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner would be fined for every engine out of compliance. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests comments on other ways to enhance its ability to enforce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these owner requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA recognizes that lighter HDEs are not usually rebuilt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because their operating life is comparable to that of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chassis. Also, their lifetime mileage is generally lower than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that of larger vehicles. For these reasons, there may not be as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> much incentive for the marketplace to offer as many options for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lighter heavy-duty vehicles. If an engine reaches the end of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutory useful life and there is no way to renew its useful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> life, the owner would no longer be able to register the vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with that engine in California. Operators of heavy-duty engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be expected to purchase vehicles equipped with engines with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a useful life comparable to their needs or purchase vehicles with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines that are designed to be rebuilt. It should be noted that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these requirements only apply to vehicles certified on an engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test; many smaller trucks would be certified on a chassis test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> c. Certification requirements and liability. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To help ensure continuous emissions control effectiveness,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposes that anyone offering a useful life renewal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certificate must certify the engine configuration that will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result from the actions they will perform on the in-use engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also proposes to require that emissions durability be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrated for the useful life renewal period being provided by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the certifier.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The resultant engine configuration must be certified in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same manner that a new engine is certified. A full emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test would be required showing that in-use HDEs, after being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restored to the engine configuration being certified, will meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all applicable HDE in-use recall emissions standards to which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine was originally certified. EPA proposes that the test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine be representative of actual in-use engines and therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be an engine at or beyond its statutory useful life. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognizes that this may be burdensome for the certifier in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> early years of the program because available engines will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally be at low mileages. However, EPA believes that it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to know how high mileage engines will perform after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being brought to the configuration being certified. EPA requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments on these and any other aspect of the certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing requirements. EPA is especially interested in comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on effective but less burdensome test engine requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

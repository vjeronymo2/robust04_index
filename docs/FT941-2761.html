			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (20): Prescription for discontent - Health A recent visit to the Dr J. Biziela Hospital in the western city of Bydgoszcz found the hospital's economic director, Leszek Kowalik, on the telephone arguing about the proposed purchase of a new piece of diagnostic equipment. 'Professor,' he shouted down the line, 'we have negotiated with everyone, now we are negotiating with some Italians who might sell more cheaply, but it won't be ready just yet, I am sorry.' A recent visit to the Polish ministry of health in Warsaw, on the other hand, found the the new health minister, Ryszard Zochowski, staying late in his office, unable to go home for the evening due to ongoing negotiations with the health service unions. These unions, he said, did not understand that the ministry could not increase their pay. 'Our budget was allotted to us by the former government of Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka, and it is not sufficient. Next year,' he concluded, 'I am sure it will be different.' The similarity between the concerns of Mr Kowalik and Mr Zochowski is not accidental. Caught between demands for modern medical supplies and demands for higher salaries, the bureaucrats and politicians who run the Polish health system find themselves, these days, almost constantly negotiating for more money. In recent months, the negotiations have taken on a new urgency. Cuts in public sector funding, including the virtual freezing of salaries for Poland's 735,000 health service workers, helped create public dissatisfaction with the Solidarity-affiliated governments which ran Poland for four years. The present government, composed of parties affiliated to the former communist party, promised to improve public sector funding. Now, Minister Zochowski faces a high level of political pressure: he must placate an electorate which is demanding better service and a group of trade unions demanding higher pay, while at the same time operating a health system which spends only Dollars 75 per capita, a figure well below western European levels of Dollars 1,200 to Dollars 2,000 per capita. Few believe that there can be much improvement in either service or salaries if the health care financing system remains unchanged. At present, all health care - including hospitals, clinics, and medical training - is ultimately financed out of the central budget, although local governments do help distribute some of the money. Given the stringency of Poland's recent budgets, it is hardly surprising that this system of central budget funding leaves hospitals in a Catch-22 position. On the one hand, as Mr Kowalik pointed out, the Biziela hospital receives only enough money from the state budget to pay its operating costs, 70 per cent of which consisting of salaries, to make really large savings. Incapable either of investment or of real savings, the hospital has slid slowly into debt, and saves money by skimping on essentials. A mere 18,000 zlotys, about Dollars 0.81,is spent on feeding each patient three meals a day. The average doctors' basic pay in Biziela Hospital is 3.3m zlotys (Dollars 150) a month. As a result, the Polish health service is famous for queues and bad food, and Polish doctors - although many are no less qualified than their western counterparts - are famed for their inattentiveness. Health care has also ceased, in fact, to be free for everyone. As in hospitals elsewhere in Poland, most doctors in the Biziela hospital have been forced to turn to some form of private practice. Some do this legally: one doctor in the department of internal medicine said he had set up an office for private consultations in his home, along with many of his colleagues. Appointments can be made faster, and medical standards are believed to be higher in this new, semi-official private sector. Others earn money illegally. At the Biziela hospital, a story, possibly apocryphal but certainly typical, is doing the rounds. Allegedly, an elderly patient was asked to pay 15m zlotys for an operation. Not knowing that this was a bribe rather than an obligatory contribution, he wrote to the hospital's director, to ask for a reduction. Bribery can also take the form of gifts to nurses, who earn on average 2.4m zlotys, a month. Although reforms of health finance have been much discussed, the governments of the past four years have so far achieved very little. Like his predecessors, Minister Zochowski favours a mixed system - one which, in other words, would ask people to continue paying for part of their health care, but in a more regulated manner. The ministry is proposing to let the central government fund health education and big central investments, while at the same time creating a national insurance system to finance both family doctors and hospitals. Although the project is not beyond the planning stages - it is not clear, for example, whether the insurance system will be wholly state-run or partly private - he said he hoped to begin putting such a system in place by the end of the year. The health service unions say they support the switch to a partially paid system. According to Mr Zochowski, they are now complaining that the changes should be brought about faster. But there are also fears that doctors and nurses will not support such changes in practice. 'We know that about half the doctors in this hospital support some form of privatisation in the health system,' said the doctor of internal medicine at Biziela Hospital. 'We know that half are against. Obviously, they are against because they make profits within this system, and prefer not to face more competition.'</p>

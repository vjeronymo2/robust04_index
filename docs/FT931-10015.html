			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Results Season: Goodwill factor catches many out USERS OF accounts can expect to see a growing number of references by companies to new standards and rulings in the next few months. Probably the most important change - and the one that caught many finance directors by surprise - comes from the Accounting Standards Board's urgent issues task force, a unit designed to quickly clamp down on ambiguities or abuses in existing standards. The unit's ruling in December 1991 dealt with the treatment in the p and l account of any acquired businesses of which a company subsequently disposed. The ruling says that any goodwill - the difference between the net assets of the acquired company and the purchase price paid - should be included in the calculation of profit or loss upon its sale. In the past, a company might have paid Pounds 100m for a business with assets of Pounds 80m, and then sold it for Pounds 90m. By writing off to reserves the goodwill of Pounds 20m and recording it in its balance sheet at Pounds 80m, it could have reported a profit of Pounds 10m from the sale. Now it must record a loss of Pounds 20m. Other rulings which will come into effect soon include one requiring the disclosure of post-retirement benefits such as healthcare, and another on the treatment of costs when a company repurchases debt. FRS 1, the accounting standard on cash flow, and FRS 2, on unconsolidated subsidiaries, are already in effect. More important will be FRS 4, which deals with capital instruments and may be released late this year. The standard will require companies to treat virtually all 'hybrid' instruments, such as convertible bonds, as debt rather than equity. All remaining equity other than ordinary shares will be classified as non-equity shareholders' funds.</p>

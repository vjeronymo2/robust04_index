			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- The South Korean puppet  Marine units and the U.S. Marines staged a "joint airlifting and  dropping operation" and a "joint field training" on the East  coast of Korea, according to a Radio No. 1 report from Seoul  Tuesday.    These provocative military exercises codenamed "increase of  the joint operation capacity" were a real war gamble of the U.S.  imperialists and the puppet clique to drop Marines by transport  planes and helicopters on supposed "enemy-controlled areas" to  blast dam, bridge and other major setups and obstacles there.    The puppet clique, instigated by the U.S. imperialists, is  now staging large-scale naval manoeuvces in the West Sea of  Korea, with the mobilization of various types of battleships.    Thus, the coastal areas of the Korean peninsula are turning  into a training place for a war against the northern half of  Korea.</p>

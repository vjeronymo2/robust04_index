			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Letter: Unrealistic rates of exchange Sir, In your editorial, 'Nordic paths diverge' (September 9), on the Finnish devaluation you write of the similarities between Finland and Sweden: 'The two countries confront remarkably similar problems . . . It follows that their respective exchange rate policies are unlikely both to be right.' Your first statement is correct. Finland and Sweden face debt deflation, negative growth and rising unemployment. Just like the UK. Your second statement is wrong. After the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system and throughout the 1970s, the average exchange rate between the Swedish krona and Finnish markka was 1.15. In the 1980s the markka soared to 1.55 in 1990. Such sustainable appreciation can only be justified by very favourable Finnish cost development in comparison with Sweden. However, OECD statistics show costs developed in similar ways. Accordingly, the Finnish markka gradually became substantially overvalued during the 1980s. How could this go on for so long and collapse so quickly? The answer is the earlier huge bilateral trade with the former Soviet Union which sheltered a large part of Finnish industry from foreign competition. The warning signals from rapidly increasing costs became too weak, but blew up when the bilateral trade recently ended. The new exchange rate between Sweden and Finland is again 1.15 and fully justifiable. That is not true of the Finnish decision-makers' handling of the exchange rate policy, however, as they have tried in vain to maintain an unrealistic rate. The natural collateral is that the Swedish krona should not be devalued. But the central bank's extraordinary monetary policy must be given support from a tighter fiscal policy.

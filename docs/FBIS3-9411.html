			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Ljubljana MLADINA in Slovene in its 22  March edition publishes several articles about the work of the  military intelligence service VOMO -- the Defense Ministry  Security Organ -- and the alleged overstepping of its authority.    On pages 2 and 3 the weekly publishes a report by Miha Dj.  Stamcar and Jani Sever, which also includes photographs of  Defense Ministry documents that support the claims made in the  article. Even though the authors do not specify the manner in  which they obtained the two documents, they claim that the  documents are "originals, according to our research," and  allegedly "connected to Operation Ljubljana, which the Defense  Ministry initiated because of an increasing number of  politicians and media in Slovenia who were pointing out the  irregularities in the Defense Ministry, VOMO, and the special  brigade Moris. However, the leadership of the Defense Ministry  did not like this. In the opinion of the Defense Ministry these  people should be supervised and information should be collected  about them in order to act more effectively against them."    MLADINA continues: "It seems that VOMO was not directly  engaged in this activity, but only its section connected to the  special brigade Moris. The core of this parallel organization,  which won the nickname `Paravomo,' consists of former and  present operatives in individual elite combat units under the  leadership of Jansa's most faithful men from the time of the  formation of the maneuver structure. Beside this, there is  supposedly also a higher level of informers, which is mostly  comprised of the minister's friends and sympathizers from all  over Slovenia. In Operation Ljubljana, however, it was mostly  the operatives who took part in it and who were subsequently  joined by experts for telephone and other types of bugging and  private detective agencies."    The article adds that "some information implies that the  Slovene police already have proof about the buggings and  surveillance" but doubt a speedy and smooth investigation of the  case because, "as the well-informed sources claim, the VOMO  supposedly holds information about some dubious business  allegedly involving the police which it could use for blackmail."    The first document entitled "Report No. 2/1" is typed on a  paper bearing the heading of the Defense Ministry and dated 16  June 1993. It is labeled State Secret, signed by Darko Njavro  "for the special brigade Moris" and addressed "personally" to  Mr. Andrej Lovsin, former VOMO chief, who resigned in January  1994. The document generally summarizes the results of the  observation of persons suspected of being involved in illegal  arms deals, but in the fourth paragraph says:    "It is evident from the reports of my informers that public  opinion, thanks primarily to MLADINA reporters, is very negative  toward the employees of the Defense Ministry and the minister  himself. Because of this the minister is demanding control over  the media, as it was agreed at the last meeting. I request the  approval of the technical means for the realization of this  task."    The second document of 16 October 1993, also labeled State  Secret, signed by Darko Njavro and addressed to Andrej Lovsin  personally, reports on purchase of arms in Villach and their  transport. The last sentence of the article says: "I request  the approval for the telephone bugging of the following numbers:  325-982, 321-954, 318-981 and 329-669" which according to  MLADINA's footnote are all telephone numbers of MLADINA's  editorial office.</p>

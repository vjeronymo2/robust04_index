			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 25 KYODO -- Japan's mining and  manufacturing production for the January-March first quarter  increased 1.5 percent from the previous period, registering the  first rise in four quarters, the Ministry of International Trade  and Industry (MITI) said Wednesday [25 May].    Shipments also scored the first growth in four quarters with  a 1.9 percent climb, MITI said.    But the readings do not mean Japan's industrial activity  recovered fully, a MITI official said, citing seasonal factors  in the reporting quarter.    In the January-March period last year, industrial output  also  turned higher as corporations stepped up manufacturing activity  before closing their book March 31, the official said.    Inventories dropped 1.9 percent in the first quarter for the  second straight quarterly fall.    The inventory-to-sales ratio declined 4.2 percent, the first  decline in three quarters, MITI said.</p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Portugal undaunted by challenge of race to catch up richer EC nations THE escudo's entry into the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System last weekend demonstrates the Portuguese government's unwavering commitment to carry through fully its economic programme of convergence with its richer EC partners, says Mr Jorge Braga de Macedo, finance minister. 'This is an example of what we are doing to favour economic rationalisation by enterprises. To provide them with a clear environment where they can make their decisions in the best possible way. This is why we are determined to eradicate inflation,' he said in an interview. He is undaunted by the challenges and risks that Portugal may face as it seeks to catch up with its European partners, and rejects any suggestion that the government's economic convergence programme could be over-ambitious. Curbing the public deficit, to around 3 per cent of GDP by 1997, is a key component of convergence. The government aims to reduce the deficit from 6.5 per cent of GDP in 1991 to 5.2 per cent this year, despite a strong rise in expenditure. Increases in value added taxes which met widespread criticism were inevitable because of the need to harmonise tax rates within the EC, he says. He admits current expenditure is 'too high' - some economists calculate it has risen by 36 per cent in this year's budget. He says further efforts will be needed to bring expenditure down, but insists this can be only be done gradually through negotiations with public sector trade unions. 'We have a programme of gradual reduction of the number of employees, to induce mobility and enhance productivity,' he says. This will help also to release pressures and shortages in the labour market - the consequence of a low 4 per cent unemployment rate. Wages have been 'a serious constraint on public sector finances,' he says. In this year's pay round, the government initially offered 6.5 per cent. This was rejected by the unions and after a series of strikes and protests, a 9.75 per cent deal was struck. The minister says real wages in the public sector rose only 1.75 per cent, on the basis of an inflation forecast of 8 per cent. Public sector wages are calculated on the basis of a forecast for inflation with additional increases for productivity and for real incomes convergence. The plan is to maintain this formula along with the government's inflation targets of 4-6 per cent in 1993-95. Mr Braga de Macedo believes this can be achieved. 'It was extremely difficult (to reach agreement). I think this year was the toughest. It was necessary to break the wage inflation mold, now it's a question of preserving the gains (achieved),' he says. By seeking to win popular agreement for wage restraint, it was possible to reduce inflation 'without tears,' he says.</p>

The NII is a system of high-speed telecommunications networks, databases, and advanced computer systems that will make electronic information_such as insurance and financial products, health and educational records, and communication of both a commercial and non-commercial nature_more widely available and accessible than ever before. This increased availability and accessibility will dramatically affect the way in which information and information services are created, used, and delivered throughout the world. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

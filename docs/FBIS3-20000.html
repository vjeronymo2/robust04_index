			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the </F> Workers Party of Kurdistan, at unidentified location, by an  unidentified correspondent in Cologne; date not specified]    [Text] [OZGUR GUNDEM] Your party issued a statement on this  year's Nevroz celebrations. You said: "Nevroz will be  celebrated in homes." What concrete measures will be taken in  this direction.    [Ocalan] People probably will be called on to stay at home  during the day. They should light fires and gather at night.  They could also fire guns if that poses no danger. The  guerrillas too might carry out particular operations. This too  is a form of celebration. Besides, it is not our position that  "there must necessarily be a major explosion" on Nevruz. For  us, every day is Nevruz. For us, Nevruz is disciplined, tactical  work. We are not trying to turn particular days into days of  special demonstrations. There are drawbacks in that. People  must show understanding of our position, which aims at  preventing massacres. There were a few massacres when an effort  was made to mark 1 May [Workers Day] as a tradition in Turkey.  Our decision is a precaution. That is how it should be seen.  But the activities of the guerrillas will continue.    [OZGUR GUNDEM] Tansu Ciller made a statement in connection  with Nevruz. She said: "We were late this year but next year  Nevruz will be declared a national holiday." The SHP [Social  Democrat Populist Party] and MHP [Nationalist Movement Party]  supported this proposal. What is the motive behind this  proposal?    [Ocalan] [Motherland Party leader] Mesut Yilmaz said: "It is  an election bribe." Apparently, this assessment is near the  truth. I do not think it came from a serious thought or as a  sign of a new process. The elections are nearing and she needs  votes. It might have been made with this in mind.    [OZGUR GUNDEM] There will be local elections a week after  Nevruz. The DEP [Democracy Party] announced that it will have no  part in these elections. How would you assess those who are  trying to get the votes that would have gone to the DEP?    [Ocalan] There are interesting developments in this regard.  The DEP has vote-winning potential, on the basis of which a game  is being played. In particular, [SHP leader and Deputy Prime  Minister] Murat Karayalcin is engaged in a ploy. After the DEP  was eliminated from the elections, he is trying to use its  vote-winning potential. His statement that "we were thinking of  legalizing Nevruz but it did not happen; next year it will be  legalized" was partly made to win DEP votes. There are already  reports that the immunity of DEP members was lifted to prevent  them from participating in the elections. It was linked with  speculation on votes. The SHP is acting with duplicity on this  issue. It supported a parliamentary commission decision on  lifting immunity. And, like Fehmi Isiklar and Feridun Yazar, he  is using some Kurds as mediators to win over the Kurdish voters.  They are creating particular lobbies to secure these votes for  the SHP. While they ask for capital punishment for those who  want to remain a bit honest and patriotic, they also ask for  votes for the SHP, which passed the execution order. This is  duplicity and a dangerous game. We will surely use our right to  reply. If they are honest, they should make their position  against this warning clear. But it is not admissible that they  should first intimidate, jail, and provoke people and then  appear in the role of a guardian angel and become part of the  game. This is a dangerous path. We warn its authors. We will  not lower ourselves to the extent of becoming tools in this  game. Such an election game does exist.    [OZGUR GUNDEM] Could we learn from you personally about the  PKK position on these elections?    [Ocalan] Ours is an active boycott of the elections.  Anyway, in our view there is a war, not elections. They will  never allow an election to be held. They have already taken  measures. They have gathered the ballot boxes in villages under  the control of village guards. The special warfare units will  allow no democratic voting. They will do everything to rig the  results in their favor. There is no sense in becoming a tool in  such an election. We cannot concede to such a game. We will  spoil this election deception that they have organized. I think  the DEP too understood this reality, that is, contrary to some  claims, the DEP did not withdraw from elections on "Apo's  [Abdullah Ocalan] instructions." Rather, DEP people knew very  well that they [the Turkish authorities] would not have allowed  them to get elected. They took all the necessary measures.    We are witnessing an open massacre of democratic people, the  denial of every election right. We know the candidates that  will now take the DEP's place. Take Cizre: Some 95 percent of  the town's population is made up of patriots and democrats. But  the RP [Welfare Party] is trying to get Karno, the head of 300  village guards, elected as mayor. Karno has always been a  village guard chieftain and has served in the most dangerous  special warfare teams. He is not the head of a town, but of a  counterguerrilla team. He is a target. He became an RP member.  That too was a tactic. They want to strengthen the RP in  Kurdistan. This is being done in accordance with a decision  made by the General Staff. We will eliminate any candidate, be  he from the SHP or any other party, and particularly if he is a  candidate from the RP, who wants to get the DEP's votes. Since  they have set out to expel us from the elections and massacre  us--massacres have indeed happened--we will use our right to  resist. I am warning such people. Don't let them say later:  "We did not hear" or "We have been given unduly severe  punishment." It is clear which side was first to inflict severe  punishment.    We supported some of the people in the Turkish Parliament  who  might have been the real voice of the people. They were not PKK  members. Despite that, we supported them for their attachment  to the people and for hoping that they would speak out about  particular demands from the rostrum. We expected nothing more  from them. Considering that they are being suppressed and put on  trial on charges of treason, we will use the same language  against those who will supplant them. We are calling on such  people not to become tools in this game. We don't want them to  become tools, be it under the guise of the RP or SHP. We are  strong. They must know that as our strength increases, they  will be severely punished. This is the way we are entering the  election period. We will employ the policy of preventing and  boycotting the elections as much as our strength allows.</p>

Magistrates and medical doctors  who had so far stayed away from the industrial action this  morning joined the striking workers. Louis Salef, general  secretary of the Confederation of Cameroon Workers Union,  explains the strike to Jean Mater Ndi:    [Begin recording] [Salef] The strike order issued by the  magistrates and medical doctors has been observed massively  throughout the country. There were also diversionary tactics by  the government. According to the head of state's message, it  was suggested that career problems affecting doctors and  magistrates would be revised, but this was only to amuse them.  It was said that their salaries would be revised and increased  by 50 percent from the reductions announced. All these are  diversionary tactics. Today all these comrades, even from the  private sector, felt the need to join us to efficiently carry  out the struggle.    [Ndi] What did you notice when you went around?    [Salef] We noted that the Yaounde magistrates had gathered  in a courtroom but were not working, which means that they were  observing their strike order. At the Yaounde central hospital,  for example, the strike order is being observed on a massive  scale. However, we deplore that some strategies have been put  in place to play down the strike and to intimidate the workers  who would like to join their striking counterparts. [end  recording]</p>

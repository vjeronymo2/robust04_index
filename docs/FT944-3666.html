			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / International Company News: Seita to be sold in first quarter The French government intends to privatise Seita, the state tobacco group which makes Gauloises and Gitanes cigarettes, in the first three months of 1995, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, has revealed, raising some FFr5bn - FFr6bn. Expressing confidence that he would meet his target of raising FFr55bn (Dollars 10bn) from privatisation in 1995, Mr Alphandery said in an interview that Seita and Assurances Generales de France (AGF) would be sold 'at the start of next year, if market conditions allow'. He would not say which sale would be first. While the AGF privatisation has been ready for some time - indeed the sale was at one point expected to precede that of Renault - this is the first confirmation of Seita's imminent sale. Hitherto, the only step the government has taken is to choose Credit Lyonnais as its adviser, while Seita has retained the advisory services of Societe Generale and Credit Commercial de France. In another sign of Seita's accelerated sale, Mr Alphandery will today put before the French Senate a bill to remove the civil service status of Seita employees and to enable France's 35,700 tobacconists to buy shares in the company on the same favourable terms as Seita's workforce. Once that bill is passed, the government only needs to pass a simple privatisation decree to launch Seita's privatisation. The government intends to put 47.5 per cent of the shares on the open market. This will leave about 2.5 per cent for the tobacconists, 5 per cent for Seita employees, a residual 10 per cent stake for the state, and around 35 per cent for a 'noyau dur' core of institutional investors. Foreign tobacco manufacturers are to be excluded from the 'noyau dur' to maintain the neutrality of Seita in distribution. Seita has a de facto distribution monopoly, supplying other brands of cigarettes as well as its own.</p>

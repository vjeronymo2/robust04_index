			<p>BFN     [Text] The Palestinian police will stop the entry and exit  of cattle and sheep at six crossing points into Jericho. The  reason is an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the area from  Hadera to Jericho. Vets from Bet Dagan visited Jericho this  week and determined that some 4,000 lambs had died from the  disease. They have also vaccinated more than 3,000 sheep in the  Gaza Strip to prevent the disease from spreading there.</p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Books: Failed hero of the Risorgimento MAZZINI by Denis Mack Smith YUP Pounds 19.95, 302 pages Looked at from this distance Italy's Risorgimento - its struggle for liberty and nationhood in the 19th century - has epic proportions. It has heroes too: the consummate statesman Count Camillo Cavour; the swashbuckling warrior Giuseppe Garibaldi; and the exiled theorist of revolution, Giuseppe Mazzini. Denis Mack Smith has already written biographies of the two former. In this account of the life and work of Mazzini he completes a triad of studies of modern Italy's founding fathers. This is not, however, so much a biography as an apologia for Mazzini. Mack Smith's aim is to improve Mazzini's reputation. For Mazzini both preached and practised armed revolution, to which some of his followers added assassination, yet in all his endeavours, including his ultimate aim of an Italian republic, he failed. Cavour and Garibaldi were far more consequential actors in Italy's drama. As the tumult of the Risorgimento recedes, their stature has grown while Mazzini's has diminished. Mack Smith attempts to adjust this balance by giving us a laudatory account of Mazzini as man and politician. He shows how Mazzini's writings inspired patriots within Italy and their sympathisers elsewhere in Europe, and how this contributed to the liberation movement's eventual success. He describes how Mazzini's personal example of austere dedication commanded admiration, especially during his long years of exile in London. Mazzini was born in Genoa in 1805. While studying law he joined the Carbonari, a secret society dedicated to overthrowing Austrian domination in northern Italy. He was betrayed, imprisoned, and exiled. Disliking the Carbonari's practice of rituals and initiations, he joined other exiles in founding the Young Italy movement, and made himself instantly famous by sending an open letter to King Charles Albert of Piedmont calling for the liberation and unification of all Italy. The King promptly threatened to imprison him if he ever returned. Young Italy activists unsuccessfully ventured a number of armed uprisings in the following years. Mazzini had to vary his place of exile from France to Switzerland and then London. He was repudiated by Cavour because of his commitment to revolution and his unwilling association with such events as Felice Orsini's assassination attempt upon Napoleon III, in which a bomb missed the Emperor but killed eight bystanders instead. For a brief moment in 1849 Mazzini tasted power. The Pope fled Rome, and for some months the eternal city was ruled by a triumvirate with Mazzini at its head. But French troops restored the Pope and Mazzini had again to flee. It was not quite his only appearance on the legitimate political scene: in his absence Messina voters twice elected him Parliamentary deputy, but the vote was each time disallowed. When Cavour and Garibaldi at length liberated and unified Italy Mazzini was a mere spectator. His labours had helped to fertilise the fruits they reaped, but there was still no place for him in the new Italy. He swallowed his republican sentiments and accepted the monarchy of Victor Emmanuel II, returned secretly to his native country to die in 1872. Mack Smith is right to claim that Mazzini's writings and personality are his chief legacy. People as various as John Stuart Mill, Thomas Carlyle and Friedrich Nietsche greatly admired him, and the foreign dynasties which ruled in divided Italy feared his influence. His book The Duties of Man confirms all testimonies to the potency of his mind and bearing. But Mack Smith's portrait is too much a eulogy. It lacks discussion of the shadows and doubts that put a human being into three dimensions. One cannot admire Mazzini, as Mack Smith would have us do, on the basis of mere sketches of his character given in the one-liners of contemporaries. The strength of this book lies elsewhere, in its telling of the complicated story of the Risorgimento and its diaspora of exile. Mazzini's central part in that story, his outer life, is here in full; but the passionate and lonely exile himself seems strangely absent.</p>

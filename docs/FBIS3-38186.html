			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has declared that the  Cyprus problem cannot be resolved through Turkey's support  alone. The same support, understanding, and courage must be  displayed by Greece as well. Cetin met with Joe Clark, the UN  secretary general's special envoy for Cyprus, in Istanbul this  morning.    In a statement after the one-hour meeting, Cetin reported  that the recent developments in Cyprus were discussed with  Clark. Cetin recalled that in his letter to the UN secretary  general, Rauf Denktas, president of the Turkish Republic of  Northern Cyprus, announced that he accepts the  confidence-building measures in principle. Cetin added:    [Begin Cetin recording] Kliridhis must do the same. The two  leaders will meet and discuss the confidence-building measures.  We want a viable and just solution for Cyprus. As in the past,  the Turkish Government will continue to contribute to efforts  made by Mr. Denktas on this subject. [end recording]    In turn, Clark remarked that the Denktas announcement that  he  accepts the confidence-building measures is an encouraging step.  Clark noted that he does not doubt that Turkey and the United  Nations share the same views on the Cyprus question.    After his meeting with Clark, Cetin left for the World  Economic Forum meetings in Davos, Switzerland.</p>

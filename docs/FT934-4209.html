			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Offshore perks curbed - Funded unapproved retirement benefit schemes / The Budget and You The Budget dealt a blow to an increasingly popular offshore pension scheme that has allowed high earners to build substantial tax-free cash lump sums. Over the past five years, certain executives have each been making contributions of over Pounds 50,000 a year to offshore trust funds now thought to be worth about Pounds 50m. These trusts, known as offshore Furbs (funded unapproved retirement benefit schemes), were an innovative response to the 1989 Budget clampdown on pension tax benefits for high earners. The latest Budget measure will affect all new offshore Furbs, but existing arrangements will still be able to retain their attractive tax benefits - providing the rules of the schemes are not altered. Furbs were designed to top up pensions for employees caught by the 'earnings cap,' now Pounds 75,000 but rising to Pounds 76,800 for the 1994/95 tax year. The cap affects members of company pension schemes set up after the 1989 Budget and members who joined any company scheme after June 1, 1989. For these employees, the maximum contributions to Inland Revenue-approved pension schemes for this tax year are limited to Pounds 11,250 (15 per cent of Pounds 75,000), while the maximum pension is Pounds 50,000 (two-thirds of the cap). Furbs are company schemes recognised by the Revenue but 'unapproved' for tax purposes. Those set up in the UK do not qualify for tax relief on contributions or tax-free roll-up of the fund, both of which are standard reliefs on 'approved' schemes. Benefits taken in the form of pensions are taxed, although only at 25 per cent. Lump sums can be paid tax-free and, for that reason, most Furbs have been set up to provide benefits in this form. Death-in-service benefits can be paid under discretionary trusts and, therefore, free of inheritance tax (IHT). Since Furbs are unapproved, there is no limit on contributions or benefits. Until the latest Budget, offshore Furbs offered all these advantages, but with the added attraction that little or no income and capital gains tax was paid on the fund. This resulted in a much larger lump sum on retirement than would have been available under an onshore Furbs, which does not enjoy tax-free roll-up. The Budget has scuppered this offshore strategy. The lump sum that is taken from any Furbs established after November 30 will be taxed at the employee's top rate. The tax will be charged on the difference between total contributions paid in and the total fund that emerges at retirement. In this way, the chancellor will bring lump sum payments from offshore Furbs in line with those onshore. Neil Campbell, manager of pensions consultant Brown Barnett Waddingham, said: 'There is no doubt that the chancellor has wiped out the main purpose of offshore Furbs.'</p>

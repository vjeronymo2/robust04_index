			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "CMI Newscast] </F>   [Text] President-elect Ernesto Samper has flatly denied his  campaign received any money of doubtful origin and placed his  accounting books at the disposal of the Prosecutor General's  Office.    [Begin unidentified reporter recording] 1. The  president-elect talked today with the prosecutor general to  request a swift and efficient investigation of the facts. He  placed the campaign books at the disposal of that office to be  thoroughly reviewed.    2. From the very start of the campaign, we warned of the  danger of the infiltration of drug trafficking money into  politics and that is why an ethics code was issued, which  devotes a special chapter on controlling the origin of resources  for the campaign, and an ethics prosecutor of the highest moral  qualities was named to enforce the code and prevent this  infiltration. No other campaign, therefore, had greater control  or was stricter in receiving resources than ours. As a result  of this strict control, we can categorically affirm today that  our campaign treasury received no money of doubtful origin.    3. Any Colombian citizen or news media wishing to review the  campaign books may do so from this moment and corroborate, as  the overseer of the national Treasury did, the origin of  donations received this past year.    4. The president-elect has once again reiterated his  unyielding commitment to fighting drug trafficking, combating it  decisively in the military field but without repealing the  policy of surrendering to justice promoted by the current  government. By the same token, he will maintain all  international commitments to cooperate in fighting this scourge.  Not one millimeter will be yielded to this crime, and the  international community will be asked to take clearer  responsibility to persecute money laundering and consumption in  developed nations.    5. The president-elect appeals for peace so situations such  as this one are not used lightly as political weapons that harm  Colombia's image abroad. [end recording]</p>

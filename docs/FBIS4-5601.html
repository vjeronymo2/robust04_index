			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 11 (KCNA) -- "The Government of the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea expresses the belief that  the governments, parliaments, political parties and public  organizations of all the anti-nuke and non-nuclear states and  international organizations and peaceloving people all over the  world will heighten vigilance against the dangerous moves of the  Japanese authorities for nuclear armament and check and  frustrate them, thereby actively contributing to peace and  security in Asia and the rest of the world," says a white paper  of the DPRK Foreign Ministry released on Monday regarding  Japan's nuclear armament that has reached a danger line now.    It further says:    In defiance of the bitter international denunciation and  apprehensions, Monju, the first fast breeder reactor of Japan,  was put into normal operation on April 5. This is a dangerous  step in Japan's moves for nuclear armament.    "Japan's nuclear armament being promoted on the danger line  today is an open challenge to the denuclearization of the Korean  peninsula and the human desire to build a nuclear-free world.  This is a question of which the international community must  take a serious view."    The white paper roundly exposes the fact that Japan,  opposing  and distorting the "peace constitution," has manoeuvred overtly  and covertly ever since the 1950s to adopt nuclear armament as  its policy and legalize it under the veil of "three non-nuclear  principles".    Citing data, it reveals that Japan has, in fact, completely  laid material and technological foundations for the production  of nuclear weapons.    Pointing out that though Japan is practically promoting  nuclear armament on the danger line, the United States and other  Western countries are turning blind eyes to this, while engaging  themselves in a hysteric pressure campaign over the fictitious  "suspicion of nuclear arms development" by the DPRK, the white  paper says: "This double standard policy virtually encourages  Japan's nuclear armament."</p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Kemper and Conseco drop merger The Dollars 2.4bn merger between Kemper and Conseco, the US financial services groups, has been abandoned by mutual consent. The failure of the deal appears to open the door to other suitors, from GE Capital to Dean Witter Discover, who have also expressed interest in Kemper. It is understood that the chief obstacle was Conseco's difficulty in securing finance. The merger has been beset with problems since it was announced in June, with Conseco first delaying it for lack of finance, then reducing its price from Dollars 2.7bn to Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.5bn). Kemper's board will be under strong pressure to arrange an alternative deal. It is thought the share price could fall to Dollars 40 in the absence of a bidder, thus opening Kemper directors to legal action by their shareholders. Mr David Mathis, Kemper chairman, said yesterday: 'Our board remains committed to the goal of maximising value for our stockholders, and we plan to explore all possible alternatives as expeditiously as practicable.' Until now, Kemper has been prevented from pursuing an alternative deal by its undertaking to pay Conseco Dollars 100m if it backed out. However, Kemper said yesterday that as the termination was mutual, the Dollars 100m was not now payable. One of the most likely bidders is GE Capital, whose earlier offer for Kemper at Dollars 60 a share had been capped by Conseco's initial bid of Dollars 67. However, Conseco's bid had been subsequently scaled down to Dollars 60 as well. It is believed that GE's interest has been reawakened in recent weeks, along with that of other potential bidders such as Dean Witter and SunAmerica.</p>

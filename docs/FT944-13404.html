			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Survey of Morocco (5): State to ease telecom links European and US telecommunications operators are getting set for the contest to break into Morocco, now planning to liberalise the sector to bring it into line with the standards of EU countries, writes David White. With a Dollars 2bn investment programme already under way up to 1997, the government plans to privatise the state telecommunications authority and bring in competition for the first time. But it has not yet decided when or how far liberalisation will go, with some evident differences of view on the issue among members of the government. Telephone services have expanded rapidly but there remains a large potential for expansion and new services to be exploited. 'We are seriously thinking about how to regulate telecoms,' says a senior government official. Services are currently the monopoly of the 100 per cent state-owned Office National des Postes et Telecommunications (ONPT). Plans are being drawn up for turning the state authority into a company that can then be privatised, and at same time foster competition at least in certain services such as mobile telephones. There are now just 1m telephone subscribers in a country with an active population of 10m. But the network has been growing rapidly, doubling in the last four years. As recently as 1986, Morocco had only a quarter of a million telephone lines and fewer than 500 public telephone booths. By last year the latter had multiplied ninefold. Being of recent vintage, it is an all-digital system. Installation of automatic services in rural areas has been stepped up, along with the introduction of a public data transmission network and two mobile radio telephone networks. Morocco beat Spain, for instance, in introducing a cellular mobile service to the international GSM standard. The ONPT has so far self-financed 45-50 per cent of investments, with the rest from loans including support from the World Bank and European Investment Bank. 'The authorities realise that without reliable telecommunications the country cannot achieve integration in the world economy,' says Mr Abdeslam Ahizoune, posts and telecommunications minister. In the next four years the ministry plans to double the telephone network to 2m lines, introduce fibre-optic cables, and follow technology developments closely in order to 'give companies the same facilities as their competitors in Europe'. After studying other countries' experience in liberalising the sector, Mr Ahizoune says mobile telephones and certain other services will be opened to competition while shares in the state authority will be sold off. But it is not yet clear what role the government will keep. Parliamentary approval is still needed for the conversion of ONPT. Privatisation could involve a strategic alliance with a foreign company, coupled with a public share offering. Mr Ahizoune says 'various models' are being considered and that the changes will be made 'as quickly as possible'.</p>

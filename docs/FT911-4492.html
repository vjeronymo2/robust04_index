			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Rail strikers ordered back PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday signed emergency legislation ordering 250,000 US rail workers back to work after just one day on the picket lines. The legislation was whisked through Congress in a day, to forestall a strike which could have left 500,000 workers idle in industries dependent on the railways. The president was woken at 1:39am yesterday to sign the bill. By 7am most of the strikers were back on the job. The strike came after three years of negotiations on some of the most complex issues ever to come before the National Mediation Board, according to its chairman, Mr Joshua Javits. A presidential emergency board was created in May 1990 to resolve the dispute. It held 219 hearings on health and welfare issues under dispute and issued a set of recommendations which pleased neither unions nor management. Unions were displeased with board proposals which backed a reduction in the size of train crews, long sought by management. The rail companies were unhappy with the size of the wage increases recommended, averaging about 3-4 per cent a year over the next three years. The legislation establishes a new emergency board to resolve remaining points of disputes or ambiguities in the previous board's recommendations.</p>

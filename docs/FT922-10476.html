			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Mixed feelings about dollar A PUBLIC holiday in Japan ensured that yesterday was the quietest day in some time on the foreign exchange markets. But compounding the slowness of trading was continued uncertainty about the dollar, which held to a narrow trading range throughout the day, writes James Blitz. Traders continued to feel jaded about the US currency in the wake of a mixed batch of economic indicators, none of which has conferred the seal of approval on the expected economic recovery. On Tuesday, indicators showed a 2 per cent rise in GDP in the first quarter but were disappointing on the issue of new home sales, which plunged 14.8 per cent in March. The picture was darkened yesterday by disappointing US income data, in which most March gains were concentrated in the farm sector rather than industry. The dollar ended a touch firmer against the D-Mark at DM1.6565, up from DM1.6555, but never broke out of its trading range. In Europe, however, traders may have stayed their hand in anticipation of figures for quarterly refunding of Treasury bonds, which came too late for the markets. In New York the dollar finished slightly higher at DM1.6575. Dealers believe today's weekly jobless figures from the US government may have some effect on the dollar. But Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi Bank, thinks the currency will have to struggle hard if it is to break through its next big target rate against the D-Mark. He said: 'You really need some fairly substantial data to see a breakthrough to DM1.6750.' Similar to other City economists, he believes dollar trading will remain mostly quiet until the US government's monthly employment figures are issued a week from tomorrow. The dollar again firmed slightly against the yen, to Y133.45 from Y133.25, partly helped by a public holiday in Japan. A trader said: 'Without the Japanese in the picture, there is no yen market.' It closed in New York at Y133.45. The fall in the yen, however, will still come as a disappointment to the Bank of Japan, which does not want the currency to weaken against the dollar as it tries to reduce Japan's huge trade surplus. It was said to have intervened in the market on Monday night to the tune of Dollars 100m in an attempt to strengthen the yen. For the first time this week, the D-Mark appeared steadier. In spite of the mounting economic crisis in Germany, there is no doubt that high German interest rates are here for some time to come. The D-Mark gave sterling its first difficult day of the week, with the pound closing  1/2 pfennig down at DM2.9325. One dealer, bewildered by more profit-taking against the pound, said: 'Everyone seems too long of the currency at present.'</p>

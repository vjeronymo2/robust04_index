			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 19 KYODO -- Hitachi Ltd. and Mitsubishi  Electric Corp. said Wednesday [19 January] they have agreed to  join forces to develop flash memory chips, tipped as one of the  boom semiconductor products of the 1990s. The two Japanese  electronics concerns said they will jointly develop a 16-megabit  flash memory chip based on Mitsubishi's own technology and a  64-megabit flash memory chip based on Hitachi's own technology.    Hitachi and Mitsubishi said SGS-Thomson Microelectronics,  the  Franco-Italian concern and Europe's second-largest chip  producer, is considering joining the Hitachi-Mitsubishi alliance.    Mitsubishi now has a business alliance with SGS-Thomson for  development of flash memory chips.    Unlike many other memory chips, flash memory chips can  retain  data even when power is shut off and can be erased and  reprogrammed in a "flash" with electric charges.    Flash memory chips are seen as the key to realizing a new  generation of portable products ranging from small computers to  digital cameras and faxes.    Hitachi and Mitsubishi said their agreement also calls for  consolidating their flash memory product lines with a view to  taking the lead in setting industry standards as required by  users.    Company officials said the deal is aimed at sharing the  risks  and costs involved in the development of a new chip. "The scale  of investment needed to match the growth of the semiconductor  business and the rapid pace of innovation has become too large  for any one company to bear in view of the risks and costs  involved," said Shoji Hirabayashi, managing director at  Mitsubishi Electric.    "This partnership between Hitachi and Mitsubishi in the  field  of flash memories involves a sharing of resources in the areas  of research and development as well as production, and as such  is an undertaking of great significance to the future progress  and development of each company," said Tsugio Makimoto,  executive managing director at Hitachi.    The semiconductor industry so far has provided the market  with flash memory chips that use two types of cell structure --  nor and nand. Nor-based chips are now the market mainstream and  used both by Hitachi and Mitsubishi for their products.    The latest agreement covers new types of flash memory  technologies -- dinor-type chips developed by Mitsubishi and  nand-type ones developed by Hitachi.    The dinor flash memory chip is an advanced version of the  existing nor-type chip, providing higher integration and single  power-source operation at lower voltage as week as shorter  access time. [as received]    The and flash memory chip has a new cell structure that  incorporates the features of nand and dor structures, providing  higher integration and single power-source operation at lower  voltage as well as small block erasability in units of 512 bytes.    Hitachi and Mitsubishi said the dinor and nand chips are  expected to become the mainstream technologies for flash memory  chips of 16-megabit and largest capacity.</p>

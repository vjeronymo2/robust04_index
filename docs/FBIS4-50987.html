			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenyang, May 22 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Government  is committed to create as many jobs as possible in carrying out  the labor reform, according to a senior government official.    Speaking at a recent conference on labor restructuring here,  Zhu Jiazhen, vice-minister of labor, said that the labor reform  and related reforms in distribution and social security have  been carried out smoothly all over China.    The labor reform involves all enterprises with different  ownerships, while a number of labor-related laws will be  formulated soon, he said.    One result of the reform is that China now has 55 million  contractual workers, he revealed.    "I believe that the labor reform will facilitate the  establishment of a modern enterprise system, the expansion of a  market economy and improvement in productivity," he told the  conference.    On the other hand, businesses will also have more and more  surplus workers, he said.    It is, therefore, essential to the success of the labor  reform to balance the relations between the labor reform and  employment, he noted.    China has 600 million laborers, more than any other country.  So the Chinese Government has the responsibility to create as  many jobs as possible for an increasing number of job seekers,  he said.    The solution to the unemployment problem requires concerted  efforts of enterprises and society as a whole, the vice-minister  said.    Most importantly, the solution lies in expanding the  country's economy, readjusting its industrial structure and  boosting its service sector, he added.    Laborers should be encouraged to renew their concepts of  value and find jobs through markets, he said.    "Why is it that so many farmers can find jobs in cities,  while many urban residents cannot? Because many urban residents  seek white-collar jobs only, which are limited in number," he  said.    The vice-minister also pointed out that the introduction of  a  social security system is crucial to social stability and the  success of the labor reform.    The reform of the medical service system has been carried  out  throughout China, he said.    A province-wide health insurance scheme to which employers  and the employees pay a proportion of salary has been launched  in 13 provinces, he said.</p>

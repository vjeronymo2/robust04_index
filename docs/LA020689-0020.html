			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> State courts convicted about 583,000 felons in 1986, a new analysis by the  Bureau of Justice Statistics said. The analysis, for the first time providing  data on state court felony activity, found that about 46% of those convicted  that year were sent to a state prison and another 21% to a local jail. A  spokesman for the bureau, part of the Justice Department's Office of Justice  Programs, said the last nationwide prison count showed there were 604,824 state  and federal prisoners as of June 30, 1988, an increase of 23,240 over the  number six months earlier. If that trend continued, the nation would need 900  new prison beds every week, said the spokesman. The analysis, based on data  from 100 counties throughout the country, found that state courts accounted for  about 95% of all felony convictions.  </P></p>

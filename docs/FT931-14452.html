			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Beijing urges banks to tighten up on lending CHINESE leaders, worried that the economy is overheating, have told banks to tighten control on lending to industry, Reuter reports from Beijing. Premier Li Peng and Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji were quoted yesterday as telling a banking conference that state-run banks this year must help cut money supply and credit, the prime source of inflationary pressure. Banks should 'control not only the size of loans but also issuance of currency,' the official Xinhua news agency quoted Zhu as saying. The comments highlight an urgent need for financial reform in China. The banking system was designed to serve the needs of Stalinist-style central planning and lacks the tools to fine-tune an emerging market economy. Last year, banks ignored government-imposed loan ceilings and poured credit into state-run industry, fuelling an investment boom underpinning 12 per cent growth. Industrial output was up 20 per cent. Since two-thirds of state industry is losing money, many loans will never be repaid.</p>

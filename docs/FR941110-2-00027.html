			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with Timken. In these reviews of TRBs it has been the consistent practice of the Department to require that discounts be reported on a transaction-specific basis. As early as June 6, 1991, in our final results of review for the 1987/88 POR ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Tapered Roller Bearings from Japan; Final Results of Review,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 56 FR 26059) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> TRBs <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), we stated that Koyo's methodology of calculating one discount factor for all bearing sales and assigning it to a group of customers is not representative of actual TRB sales experience, since it fails to tie the actual discounts granted to the sales to which they apply (56 FR 26059). Thus, we did not allow discounts, rebates, or price adjustments based on broad allocations in that review. Moreover, in our 1993 supplemental questionnaire for these administrative reviews, we requested documentation of the discount rates in effect during each of the PORs. We also asked Koyo to report discounts and sales allowances on a transaction-specific or, if that were not possible, on a customer-specific basis. However, since Koyo did not report its U.S. discounts and sales allowances on a transaction-specific basis for the reviews in question, we assigned, as BIA, the highest percentage discount reported for any U.S. sale to all sales that received a discount during each POR. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 23:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Timken contends that Koyo's ESP offset cap is inflated due to the Department's inclusion of freight-out expense and commissions which the Department should re-classify as direct selling expenses, not indirect. Timken points out that Koyo reported its U.S. sales commissions on a transaction-by-transaction basis as direct expenses. Similarly, Timken states that there is no basis for including freight-out in indirect selling expenses since freight, in general, is considered a movement charge when calculating USP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Koyo agrees that the Department should define the ESP offset cap in the same manner as in its other recent TRB reviews. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with Timken that freight incurred in the United States should be treated as a direct deduction from USP pursuant to 19 CFR 353.41(d) and have done so for these final results. However, the Department rejected Koyo's claim for a deduction for home-market commissions because Koyo was unable to tie the total commission amount to sales of covered merchandise at verification. We have, therefore, included U.S. commissions in the ESP cap, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 24:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Timken objects to Koyo's reporting of U.S. freight expenses based on sales value. Timken notes that the Department requested that Koyo report its freight-in expense based on the cost of goods sold, but Koyo indicated that it was unable to comply. Timken cites  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> TRBs  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> to assert that the Department's consistent position is that ``allocation of freight costs by volume, weight, distance, or a combination of these, is preferable to allocations based on sales value'' (TRBs 56 FR, 41508, Comment 17). Timken requests that the Department re-allocate freight expenses based on the weight of the merchandise, since the net weight of individual bearings is available in the administrative record of these reviews. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Koyo claims that its method of allocating freight expenses over the sales value of the subject merchandise remains the most accurate method available to account for these expenses. Koyo asserts that the Department accepted this method as reasonable in prior reviews and should continue to do so for these final results. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with Koyo. While we have stated, as Timken notes, that allocations of freight costs by volume, weight, distance, or a combination of these elements are preferable to allocations based on sales value, we have also recognized that individual bearing firms do not maintain records of freight expenses based on weight (see TRBs). Therefore, we determined that Koyo's allocation of freight expense based on value is a reasonable method and does not produce distorted results. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 25: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Timken states that the Department is faced with competing data for export sales expenses reported in May 1991 (revised November 1993) and export department expenses verified in 1987 for the period 1974/85. Since both the March 1987 and November 1993 verification reports indicate that total export expenses were ``unsubstantiated'' or an aspect of the expense was ``not verified,'' the Department should use the highest figure on the record for determining export selling expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Koyo counters that Timken has misconstrued language in the Department's verification report that Koyo failed verification regarding its selling expenses. Koyo asserts that the statement that the breakdown of employees into various categories ``was not verified'' means that the verification team did not address that issue in detail, and not, as Timken has interpreted it, that Koyo failed verification regarding its selling expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with Koyo that Timken misinterpreted the verifiers' explanation of Koyo's home-market indirect selling expenses, specifically selling expenses incurred in Japan with respect to U.S. sales. Since export selling expenses were, indeed, satisfactorily verified in November 1993, we have used the export selling expenses reported in Exhibit C&hyph;16 of Koyo's November 10, 1993, submission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 26: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Timken asserts that Koyo, in its calculation of U.S. inventory carrying costs, failed to include the imputed interest expense for time in transit from Japan to its U.S. subsidiary, American Koyo Company (AKC). Timken cites  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Silver Reed America, Inc.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 12 CIT 250, 683 F.Supp. 1393 (1988), as support for its position that such an interest expense can be deducted from ESP. Although Koyo contends that the U.S. inventory period includes time in transit, Timken maintains that there is no support for that claim in the administrative record. Timken cites the Department's U.S. verification report (March 27, 1987), covering the PORs from 1974/85 wherein the Department determined that inventory carrying costs, which were reported on a similar basis as the present period, did not include time in transit from Japan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Timken urges the Department to increase the reported inventory time by a reasonable time for shipment from Japan to the United States, using data supplied by another producer, or by assuming at least thirty-five days in transit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Koyo states that Timken is incorrect in its assertion that Koyo's U.S. inventory carrying cost does not include ``time on the water''. Koyo explains that AKC takes title to merchandise when it leaves Koyo's warehouse in Japan, and it is booked into AKC's inventory at that time. Therefore, Koyo contends that AKC's inventory values used to determine the average time in inventory include the value of the inventory in transit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We disagree with Timken. Koyo submitted U.S. inventory carrying costs in two separate stages, the expenses incurred in Japan for exported goods and the inventory expenses associated with U.S. sales. Koyo states that these costs include ``time on the water''. Because its sales were satisfactorily verified, and we have no reason to believe that this expense is inaccurate, we have continued to use Koyo's U.S. inventory carrying costs as reported. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

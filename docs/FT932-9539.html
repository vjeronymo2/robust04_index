			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / GE Capital poised to win control of GPA GPA GROUP, the troubled aircraft leasing company, is to cede control to GE Capital, General Electric's financial services arm, under an agreement signed in principle last night, writes Roland Rudd. GE Capital has an option to acquire 60 per cent of GPA's equity, rising to 80 per cent under certain conditions by March 1997. GPA refused last night to disclose how much GE was paying to take control. GE will also help GPA meet its funding commitments by purchasing 23 aircraft from GPA's existing portfolio and 22 to be delivered next year, worth a total of Dollars 1.35bn. GPA said some of its existing shareholders and bankers would provide additional loans if the deal went ahead. The agreement is contingent on the banks agreeing to the restructuring of the group's Dollars 5.5bn of debt. However, it was not clear whether the deal will prove acceptable to all of the group's lenders. While GPA's lead banks are firmly behind the agreement, some of GPA's lenders have voiced their opposition to any deal involving the sale of the company's most valuable aircraft in exchange for GE Capital taking control. GPA will tell its bondholders, when it meets them today in New York that it plans to meet interest payments in May and June. GPA had a temporary waiver on its banking covenants until May 17 when more than Dollars 50m of bonds mature. A further Dollars 170m bonds mature by the end of June. A GPA banker said failure to support the deal would force GPA to ask bondholders for a payment moratorium. One of the group's biggest lenders said: 'The only way to avoid a moratorium with bondholders - which would inevitably lead to examination (the Irish equivalent of administration) - is to back GE's decision to take control of GPA.' However, one of its bankers said: support the 'I do not want GPA to end up as a liquidation trust unable to generate sufficient cash flow to pay off all its creditors.' The talks have been led by Mr Gary Wendt, chief executive of GE Capital and Mr Tony Ryan, GPA's chairman and founder. Mr Wendt, a former non-executive director of GPA, is understood to have assured Mr Ryan of his continued support as chairman if the deal goes through. Mr Ryan recently fought off an attempt by two of GPA's executives to have him replaced GE Capital owns Polaris Aircraft Leasing, one of GPA's big competitors with more than 400 aircraft on lease. It once owned a 22.7 per cent stake in GPA but sold it in the mid 1980s for a profit of more than Dollars 50m. GPA's financial pressures stem from its over-ambitions in the late 1980s when it ordered large numbers of aircraft in anticipation of continuing rapid growth of air travel. Recession, however, brought its weakened balance sheet to the point of collapse. The refinancing, Page 24</p>

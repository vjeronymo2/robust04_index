The Pirai problem area concerns national property. Reference  must therefore be made to other basins that are also in a  threatening situation that is the result of meddling by the hand  of man.  <H5>  Rio Yapacani Basin </H5>   Originating at the Cienaga River, the Yapacani River basin  has a steep downgrade, from 2,400 meters above sea level to  1,500 meters above sea level, within the first 56 kilometers of  its descent. This contributes to the natural excavation of the  riverbed and the carrying down of sediments by the river, as  well as the erosion of the surrounding hillsides by farming and  overgrazing. At the tableland there is good undergrowth, which  leads to the assumption that the input of sediment to that point  is low.    This confirms that the enormous volumes of sediment arriving  at the lowland, silting up the riverbed, and forcing its  permanent divergence have their origin in the mesothermal  valleys.    The consequences are serious problems to roads, bridges, and  other infrastructure in the lowland.  <H5>  Rio Surutu Subbasin </H5>   The studies made under the SENMA-BID [expansion not given]  project, bear out the conclusion that due to the steep downgrade  of its subbasin and main riverbed, the Surutu River presents  torrential characteristics and flash currents that create a high  risk of flashfloods, and has a substantial capacity for natural  excavation of the riverbed, and for carrying down sediments  (gravel and sand) that are deposited beginning at the Huaytu  area where its banks lack vegetal cover. This renders the basin  ``very frail,'' with results that are being seen around the  mouth of the Yapacani River--where some years ago the main  channel was two kilometers away from the bridge and where it is  now threatening to break up the access road to the bridge--and  at Huaytu where the ongoing natural excavation is threatening  the rural farmlands.  <H5>  Rio Palometilla Subbasin </H5>   The main problem presented by this river is the high volume  of sediments (soil and embankment) it carries down from its  headwaters and the hillsides, owing to the farmers' clearing of  trees and shrubs from the terrain. The original level of the  riverbed has been raised, causing damming and flooding of  considerable magnitude in the ``El Torrente'' sector, with  destruction of the Montero-Yapacani road creating traffic  problems, and the inundating of certain farming and  cattle-raising sectors downstream in quasi-permanent form, with  consequent losses.  <H5>  Rio Ichilo Basin </H5>   According to SENMA-BID researchers, this river and its  tributaries carry sediments in suspension in considerable  quantities, resulting from farming at the foot of the mountain  and in the lower sector of the basin.  <H5>  Rio Palacio Subbasin </H5>   The damming and flooding of the Antofagasta area is  attributable to the following causes:    1) Farming activities (clearing of land and trails) have  blocked natural drainage;    2) When the YPFB [Bolivian Government Oil Deposits] built  its  seismological stations, it left embankments that actually are  submerged dams; when the ENFE [National Railway Enterprise]  built the railway, in 1970, crossing the area's natural drainage  lines it caused the obstruction of the riverbed by aquatic and  shrub-like vegetation.    This is a simplified summary of a wide-ranging study that  has  been made on the problems in the river basins, that are  adversely affecting the farming and livestock industry, the  transportation industry, and road infrastructure, in addition to  damaging the environment.    It is recognized that substantial programs to remedy this  situation have not been developed, but targeted efforts have  been deployed, such as the drainage system project in San Juan  de Yapacani (JICA [Japanese International Cooperation Agency]);  the study and design of the drainage system in the colonia  Antofagasta (FAO/CORDE-CRUZ [Food and Agriculture  Organization/Santa Cruz Development Corporation]), which is to  be financed by PRODEPA [expansion not given]; and the SEARPI  [expansion not given] and Regional Drainage Study pilot projects  by the CIAT [International Center for Tropical Agriculture].</p>

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / International Company News: Trizec lifts offer to creditors Trizec, the Calgary-based property developer, is poised to finalise its debt restructuring after improving its offer to creditors with the help of a CDollars 300m (USDollars 218m) injection from an investment group led by New York financier Mr Gerald O'Connor. A committee of senior debenture holders, who have held out for better terms since Trizec launched its recapitalisation almost a year ago, has urged its members to approve the proposals. Information meetings for debenture holders, many of which are European institutions, will be held in Zurich, Toronto and New York over the next fortnight. The injection by the US investment fund, known as Argo Partnership, brings the Trizec rescue package to more than CDollars 1bn. Horsham, the holding company controlled by Canadian entrepreneur Mr Peter Munk, earlier agreed to put up as much as CDollars 717m. Under the latest plan, Horsham will have a maximum equity stake of 44 per cent in Trizec. Argo will own 24 per cent, leaving outside shareholders with 31.5 per cent. Trizec, which is North America's biggest publicly-traded real estate developer, is presently controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family. The main change in the latest offer is a CDollars 300m increase in the amount of cash available to securities holders, as an alternative to the common shares to be issued under the plan. The cash amount available to senior debenture holders has risen from 55 per cent of the value of their loans to 76 per cent, or a total of CDollars 917m. Mr Kevin Benson, Trizec's chairman, said that besides improving the chances of the debt restructuring going through, the sweetened 'liquidity offer' should have a stabilising effect on Trizec's share price once the plan is implemented. It hopes to implement the debt-restructuring towards the end of July.</p>

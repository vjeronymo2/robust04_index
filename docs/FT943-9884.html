			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / US agriculture chief could face gifts inquiry Will a ride in a company jet and tickets to two sporting events bring down Mr Michael Espy, the US secretary of agriculture? Did he, as is alleged, take these gifts in exchange for easing up on proposed poultry regulation? These questions frame the latest mini-scandal in the pursuit of ethical purity in Washington. Mr Espy has been the subject of a Federal Bureau of Investigations probe and Ms Janet Reno, the attorney general, is expected to ask a federal court to appoint an independent prosecutor to investigate the matter, yesterday's Washington Post reported. Mr Espy is accused of having flown to Washington on a corporate aircraft from Arkansas. He is also accused of accepting tickets to a football game and a basketball game. The alleged donor is Tyson Foods, the largest poultry supplier in the US and an early supporter of President Bill Clinton. One farm lobbyist who admires Mr Espy's work as secretary said the charges, despite the low value of the gifts, were 'a serious matter' because food safety inspectors have for years been fired for having taken a turkey or ham for Christmas dinner. 'It is no bigger deal than all the money Clinton took from Tyson,' said Mr Niel Ritchie of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy in Minnesota. 'But any time anyone in Washington takes travel and favours from people they're supposed to be regulating, it diminishes confidence that they will be doing a fair job.' Although Mr Espy reimbursed Tyson's for some of the expenses, according to his staff, and the gifts were minor, he is accused by some of delaying poultry regulation reform for a time. The charges have been causing some consternation in the Washington farm lobby. 'I think its a witch-hunt that may have something to do with different perceptions of what is acceptable,' said Miss Carol Brookins, a Washington agriculture consultant. 'The real issue is, at what point do some of these ethics rules get to being ridiculous?' She and several farm lobbyists say an investigation now would be 'regrettable' if it detracted from the focus needed on next year's re-authorisation of US farm programmes.</p>

			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TICKET AGENCY FEES  </P> <P> Recently I bought two tickets advertised at $21 each to see Midnight Oil at the  Universal Amphitheatre.  </P> <P> By the time Ticketmaster was through with me, those same tickets cost $28 each.  For those of you scoring at home, that's a full 33% surcharge.  </P> <P> Consumers need and deserve protection from Ticketmaster and Ticketron, which  between them control the entertainment ticket industry in our state.  </P> <P> TOM ORTENBERG, Studio City  </P> <P>  A Ticketmaster executive said the charges above the $21 ticket price were: a  service fee of $4.25; a handling fee of $1.50 per order (in this case, 75 cents  a ticket); and a facilities surcharge of $2 that went to the Universal  Amphitheatre.  </P> <P> </P></p>

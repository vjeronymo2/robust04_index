			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (15): Few openings if Bush loses - Most dealers expect the president to be re-elected in October. But should defeat seem imminent, US markets would fall significantly GEORGE BUSH's mortality, both physical and political, was rammed home at the end of last year by his bilious tour of Japan, and then in February by his embarrassing showing in the New Hampshire primary. Things look better for him now, but it still does not require too much imagination to picture his losing the presidency in November. Such a volcanic change of the political landscape seems certain to produce shifts in the market. This could require changes, both in stock selection and also at the level of international asset allocation. But the investment professionals have not spotted many new opportunities. At the moment, they are rather more worried by the damage a Bush defeat would do. Despite his well publicised wobbles at the turn of the year, most dealers believe that Mr Bush will win again, and US stocks are priced accordingly. Should it become obvious that the president was going to lose, US markets would probably endure significant falls. A Bush defeat would probably mean that the US economy would have fallen below current expectations, and that recovery had not arrived on cue. This would require cuts in share prices. Wall Street would also perhaps react negatively to a Democrat president, solely on grounds of sentiment. It is difficult to prove this with any certainty, because Democratic victories are now so rare - the last was Jimmy Carter's in 1976 - but Peter Oppenheimer, chief economic strategist at Hambros Bank, has produced figures which suggest that the market is politically sensitive. The Dow-Jones index shows a detectable election cycle under both parties, in which it rallies sharply in the last six months prior to the election, and performs strongly in the third year of the political cycle (as indeed it did last year). However, according to Mr Oppenheimer, 1976 shows up as an exception to the rule. In the six months prior to that election, US equities only rose 2.1 per cent, the lowest rise in any comparable period since 1968, and far lower than the 21.3 per cent in the six months before Ronald Reagan's first victory. Markets also did worse in the first 12 months of Carter (down 11.4 per cent) than at any other comparable point in the political cycle - in the first 12 months of George Bush, the S&amp;P Composite went forward 22.3 per cent, according to Hambros. These last figures catch the height of 'merger-mania', which was great for stocks. This was closely associated with the Republicans, and a new administration, with tighter controls over corporate activity, would close off hopes of a return to the big leveraged deals. In the long term, Chris Goudie, of Baring Investment Management, doubts whether a Democrat administration would be so bad, but says the short-term effect would be marked. This would make long-term bond yields more attractive. For international asset allocation, the tougher question concerns the dollar. Dealers are unlikely to trust a Democrat administration, which would put the dollar under pressure. This would be an argument for switching out of US equities. However, Mr Goudie again tones down this risk. He suggests that this would only be a marked effect if Democrats retained control of the Senate, which some commentators believe they could lose in November. The other risk concerns base rates, which many might expect to move up under a Democratic administration. However, a political change seems unlikely to affect this, as they are already thought to be at the bottom and set to rise with growth in the economy, even if Bush does win. A Bush defeat would, therefore, probably be bad news for US equities in the short, and possibly the medium, term. If asset allocation is hard to call, stock selection is even tougher. Here are one or two of the experts' hunches: Oil companies could be expected to do very badly, for several reasons. First, the Democrats are thought to be much more likely to push through tighter legislation against pollution. Martin Brook, fund manager for Cannon Lincoln, points to the legislation already enacted in California to force petrol providers to lay on special pumps which cut down on emissions. These cost roughly Dollars 1,000 a pump. It would be bad news for oil companies, and their share prices, if such measures came into force across the US. Second, the oil industry has always been regarded as a natural bedmate of the Republican party. Loss of its privileged access to government would harm sentiment towards it among traders. Motor companies might also expect to be hit hard by environmentalist legislation against 'gas guzzlers' requiring cars to have a certain minimum number of miles per gallon. It is doubtful, however, whether a Democrat president would do much to harm the car industry, as it is likely he would have been elected with the help of blue-collar votes from Michigan and the other auto-industry states. Environmental protection companies ought, by the same token, to do better. In the UK, Commercial Union has recently launched an international investment trust to take advantage of investment opportunities that arise from enacting new environmental legislation. It is skewed slightly towards the US. Specialist niche companies, involved in purification, air filter scrubbers or monitoring systems, which tend to trade globally, could all do well. Retailers might be helped, particularly those at the lower end of the market. Michael Moule, of Touche Remnant, who manages the Bankers and Law Debenture investment trusts, points out that companies such as K-mart and Wal-mart might benefit from any extra spending power given to people in lower earning brackets. Their lack of any international exposure would also lead them to out-perform other stocks. Health might be given a boost in confidence under the Democrats, so companies operating in the sector could perform well. It might not be wise to carry this argument too far, as these stocks have already performed very well. For example, Framlington's health unit trust, 60 per cent of which was invested in US health stocks, rose 91 per cent last year alone.</p>

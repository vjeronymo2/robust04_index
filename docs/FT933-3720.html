			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Arts: Quiet] Chess - Radio THE TIMES world chess championships began on Tuesday, but with no radio commentary even on Radio 5. Chess is no more use to radio than algebra. Radio 3 at least marked the Kasparov-Short contest with its Sunday revival of David Benedictus' play En Passant, about a lower-level meeting, between two immigrant champions from east Europe at a hard-up provincial congress. Nevinsky (Dave King) thinks he had been shopped by Groenmann (TP McKenna) in their old days and is determined to beat him. That is really all the plot. It was fun and it was about chess. 'Nobody,' said Tim Crook of Independent Radio Drama Productions lately, 'can match the millions of pounds' worth of co-production, direct funding, grants and sponsorship which IRDP has achieved with LBC,' but then he did not expect LBC, the London independent station, to come off the air. He hopes that IRDP will find the work to keep them going, as indeed they deserve. I hear their plays whole on tapes, not fragmentarily as on LBC; those I have had lately all took awards at the 1993 International Radio Festival in New York. 1000 to One, by Gella Richards, a telephone SOS to a rape-report group by the victim of a male rape, won a gold medal for writing; Day Out, by Tom Newell, a lifer's official day of freedom from prison, a silver for direction. Getting Back, by Ben Rice, was more generous with story and character. Two telephone salesmen in a dubious company of stationery dealers try an exchange of personalities; the more honest comes off best. This won a bronze for best comedy special (sic). All were directed and produced, ably but unambitiously, by the tireless Tim Crook and Richard Shannon. I wish them luck. They are not likely to seek help from any of the organisations mentioned in The Gift Horses (Radio 4, Thursday), the first of two programmes about charities. It was a thoughtful, well-informed survey of sensibly-organised charitable activity. The 1980s, we were reminded by Andy Downes of Centre Point, began a period of earnest 'can't afford it'; but Live Aid's television use of the Ethiopian famine led to better understanding that charity required little more than credit-card and telephone. We heard of the different approaches likely to be most effective when professionally handled. The request must be a 'wooing', with mutual respect between giver and taker. Legacies must be correctly worded. Overt pity or patronising should be avoided, so each side should feel respect. (One hopes that the lady who offered her old stair-carpet for the residents of Centre Point to sleep in was not too much offended by their refusal.) These maxims were not put out by BBC presenters, but by executives of such outfits as GEC, Campaign for Oxford, Chapter One, Save the Children and the Royal National Institute for the Blind. The one BBC presenter was John Skrine - who is now a charity administrator. I am not usually keen on Radio 2's Spotlights, those audible reference-books, but I could not resist Wednesday's, on Mary Martin, my all-time favourite musical leading lady. As a fan I most enjoyed items like 'Wonderful Guy' from South Pacific (though I would rather have had 'I'm gonna wash that man right out of my hair'), and a recollection of Dolly Levi in Hello Dolly in 1965.</p>

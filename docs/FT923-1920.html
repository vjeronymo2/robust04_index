			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (6): Doleful statistics - Unemployment SLOW OR NO economic growth spells rising unemployment in almost all developed countries this year. But high unemployment is nothing new. The latest recruits to the unemployed will add to the seemingly permanent pool of long-term joblessness that has scarred the US and European economies for a decade or more. Almost 30m people of working age will be both out of work and looking for employment this year, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The average unemployment rate among the OECD's 24 member countries is expected to be 7.5 per cent, up from 6.2 per cent in 1990. Yet these unemployment rates only tell part of the story, as the OECD acknowledged in its latest Employment Outlook. Unemployment rates only include people who are available and looking for work. They exclude the 'economically inactive': people who have no jobs but have given up searching for one. The charts show the international pattern of non-employment rates in the 1980s: the sum of the unemployed and the economically inactive as a percentage of the total population. They cover men only, as males constitute the bulk of the unemployed; and they include people of prime working age, to exclude the impact on inactivity rates of higher educational participation among young people and early retirement among older men. Two patterns emerge: Non-employment rates are much more constant across countries than unemployment rates. The US, Canada and Australia have non-employment rates similar to those in Europe. Only Japan and Sweden have low non-employment rates by OECD standards. Non-employment rose during the 1980s in almost every OECD country. In continental Europe, this rise was largely reflected in the unemployment statistics. Elsewhere - the UK, Australia, Canada and Sweden - the rise in activity was at least as important as the rise in unemployment. The US is the exception: its non-employment rate fell slightly, after rising in the 1970s. But it was the standard around which the rest of the OECD converged. Little wonder the OECD has become increasingly worried about the impact of high unemployment on economic efficiency and social stability. 'High unemployment entails economic waste and widespread individual hardship,' it said. But the costs are more than economic. Internal OECD briefing papers write of the links between joblessness and economic deprivation: drug use and abuse, racial tensions and a rising tide of crime and violence. 'The accompanying process of economic and social exclusion can endanger social cohesion,' the OECD says.</p>

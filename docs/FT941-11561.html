			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: Polaroid improves to Dollars 39m in fourth term Polaroid, the US photography group, increased fourth-quarter net profits to Dollars 39.2m from Dollars 29.6m in the previous year. However, the group warned that the first half of the current year would reflect the effects of slow economic growth in Europe, the stronger US dollar and start-up costs on a coating facility. For the full year, it reported net losses of Dollars 51.3m, compared with profits of Dollars 99m last time, partly because of the severence payments and accounting changes. Operating profits, excluding the unusual items, would have been Dollars 208m, against Dollars 214m last time, the company said. The fourth-quarter profits growth was caused partly by a strong response from US consumers to a new instant camera system called Captiva. The system helped the company reach its largest number of camera shipments in 10 years. Polaroid said it expected to increase operating profits significantly in the current year in spite of weakness in the first half.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 16 Jun (EFE) -- Venezuelan Congressman Paciano  Padron, the president of the Andean Parliament, stated today  that the Andean Parliament is opposed to the commercial blockade  against Cuba and Haiti as a way to restore democracy in both  countries.    In remarks to the magazine CCD [Democratic Constituent  Congress], the official mouthpiece of the Peruvian Congress,  Padron said: "It is a bad idea to continue the blockade against  Cuba and Haiti because the people have the right to survive and  subsist."    The Andean Parliament president said: "It is not ethical to  submit a nation to starvation in the name of democracy."    Padron added that commercial blockades, like that imposed  recently on Haiti and the one that has prevailed for 32 years  against Cuba, "affect the people, not the generals or officials  who continue drinking wine and eating meat while the people have  nothing to quench their thirst or assuage their hunger."    The Venezuelan congressman asked the OAS to find a political  solution to the Haitian and Cuban problems and to conduct all  necessary diplomatic negotiations "instead of settling for less  humane alternatives."</p>

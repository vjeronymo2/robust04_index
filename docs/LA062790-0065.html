English fans drinking in a bar  "started throwing bottles at the Italians and car windows were smashed,"  British Embassy spokeswoman Kay Coombs said.  </P> <P> FIFA, soccer's governing body, rejected a West German appeal to overturn the  one-game suspension of Rudi Voeller for a red card he received in the 2-1  victory over the Netherlands last Sunday. Voeller is barred from the World Cup  quarterfinal game Sunday against Czechoslovakia.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ian Mather article: "Self-Interest That Exposes Europe's </F> Southern Flank"]    [Text] The European Union's [EU] continued refusal to  tackle the explosion of violence in the Maghreb under its  newly-created common foreign policy has awakened fears that  Europe is dangerously neglecting its exposed southern flank.    Spain in particular is pressing the other EU states to make  the Maghreb, which consists of Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Libya  and Mauritania a priority for a co-ordinated EU initiative,  warning that the Union could otherwise receive some nasty shocks.    The turmoil in North Africa has grown dramatically since  last  November when, under the Maastricht Treaty, a list of common  foreign policy "joint actions" was defined. Even so most EU  states, preoccupied with ex-Yugoslavia and the issue of Central  and East Europe, remain reluctant to bring their weight behind  attempts to solve the violence.    The latest ominous development is in Algeria, where most of  France's remaining 2,000 nationals are fleeing a virtual civil  war. Islamic fundamentalism, rooted in economic deprivation, is  cutting a swathe right across North Africa. Algeria is the  tinder box. If the fundamentalists win in Algeria, a bush fire  could sweep away the other relatively stable governments of the  Maghreb.    The Europe Union faces the threat of mass migration and the  transplantation of terrorism on to European soil as well as the  destruction of trading and political relations. That is why  stability and prosperity in the Maghreb are vital for security,  not just in the Mediterranean region, but throughout the EU.    When the European governments decided on their priorities  for  the common foreign and security policy inaugurated by the  Maastricht Treaty, they decided to concentrate on the former  Yugoslavia, Russia, the Middle East, South Africa and Somalia.  The Maghreb was too close to home, and too many special  national interests were involved.    Five years ago things looked more promising. A serious  attempt was made by the European Commission to create a free  trade area with the Maghreb, backed up by political ties. It  was sparked by a letter from King Hassan of Morocco to the EC  proposing Moroccan membership. The Commission said that the  request could not be considered as Morocco was not a European  country.    However, the idea took root that North Africa should be  helped. In addition to providing aid for development efforts  were to be made to build the economies of North African  societies through small businesses in the hope of building a  middle class. There was also to be help for debt repayments  through a new development bank.    Two years ago, in its first formal declaration dealing with  north Africa, the European Community at the Lisbon summit  expressed its determination to foster "partnership" with the  Maghreb.    But the free trade initiative has fizzled out, and nothing  has come of the Lisbon declaration. The economic downturn in  Europe led EU countries which had economic interests that  conflicted with those of the Maghreb to pursue their own  short-term advantage.    Spain was the first to ignore attempts towards free trade  when it decided to protect its fishermen rather than agree to a  fisheries pact with Morocco. Spain, concerned about its Canary  Islands produce, then followed France in the GATT talks in  forcing the EU to agree to a minimum entry price for vegetables  and fruit at the Maghreb's expense.    Attempts are now under way to compensate Morocco, but  Germany  and Britain are opposing Spain's proposal to grant extra EU  funds to support Morocco's balance of payments.    A bloc-to-bloc approach with the Maghreb Union, an economic  group formed to negotiate trade agreements, is in any case  impossible. Libya is excluded from any EU initiatives, because  it is the target of sanctions resulting from the bombing of the  Pan Am Boeing 747 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in which 270 people  died. Moreover, Colonel al-Qadhdhafi seems to be losing his  grip, leading to the fascinating idea that Europe might find  itself bolstering his regime on the grounds that anything is  preferable to anti-Western Islamic fundamentalism.    Mauritania is also ineligible for any deals with the EU  because it gets separate benefits from the Lome Convention,  which gives preferential trading terms with the EC to former  colonies. But it is the most fragile country of all Algeria --  which is the case study of how the interests of individual EU  nations continue to take precedence over a common EU foreign  policy. The EU is split over Algeria. France, which as the  former colonial power has most to gain from a return to  stability, is pressing for a loan of $1billion to Algeria to  help solve the balance of payments crisis. But Germany and  Britain are sceptical about a loan they believe would delay  economic reforms.    Tunisia has been struggling to make something meaningful out  of the Maghreb Union. But even Tunisia will not be strong  enough to be able to offer fully free trade with the EU until  around 2010. There are still hopes of finalising partnership  deals with Morocco and Tunisia by the end of the year, and with  Algeria later, unless that country falls into a political abyss.    But this will not be enough. The EU's policy towards the  Maghreb consists of a fatal combination of good intent  accompanied by narrow national self-interest. As member states  argue over where the money should come from, events might well  overtake them.</p>

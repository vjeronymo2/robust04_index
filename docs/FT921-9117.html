			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Observer: Peace of cake The former occupant of Black Forest Chateau has returned. After a three-year stint in his native Cyprus, Chris Leveras is back in Teesside helping to spare the government's blushes with some cheesecake. In 1982 Leveras founded his cake-making company, CDL 44 Ltd - CDL for his initials and 44 for his age at the time - in Hartlepool. Six years later he had built it up to employ 400 producing a turnover of Pounds 5.5m and then sold out to Allied-Lyons. Now he is taking a second bite at the British appetite for sweetmeats by setting up a new company, Livera Foods, and announcing plans to produce up to 75m gateaux and cheesecakes a year from a state-of-the-art factory in Stockton-on-Tees. This gourmand assault on the market has spared the government embarrassment, in a Tory marginal con- stituency, by promising to create 700 jobs on a site to which the Ministry of Defence had planned to move its large quality-assurance unit before the peace dividend forced a rethink.</p>

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Unwelcome gifts for the new team: The yen's surge is adding to the Japanese government's economic problems A sure sign of the Japanese economy's poor health has been the unusual reluctance of most leading companies to court their customers and politicians with the traditional mid-year gift, an ornately wrapped melon, a box of pale Japanese cherries or a quaint collection of different coffees and milk substitutes. Instead of the cherries, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the new prime minister, was presented this week with an economy sliding into the second phase of a 'double-dip' downturn, as well as an embarrassingly large trade surplus and an irrepressible yen, which closed yesterday in Tokyo at a record Y103.37 to the dollar. Mr Hosokawa, who wants international intervention to calm the currency markets, fears the yen's rapid appreciation will delay economic recovery by putting extra pressure on companies already having a bad year. The yen surge has also rekindled the mid-1980s debate over whether Japanese industry will be 'hollowed out' by a shift of production capacity to cheaper locations such as Malaysia and China. The concerns about industrial decline are probably overdone, but Japanese companies are facing their fourth consecutive year of falling profits and are looking for new ways to cut costs. In the 1980s, the effects of a strong yen were countered by frenetic asset price rises and profit growth of the 'bubble' years. In the early 1990s, companies are still sweating out 'bubble' era excesses and must cope with a currency close to the important threshold of Y100 to the dollar. Mr Hosokawa and his seven-party coalition government will need to address the economy quickly. There are calls from industry to cut official interest rates and reduce income taxes, and counter-arguments from the finance ministry that slowing tax revenues have left the country unable to afford another stimulatory spending package or tax relief. A few months ago, in the spring, Japan's economic planners were confident that the buds of recovery were emerging. One senior official even warned that the economy was in danger of 'overheating'. New car sales rose in March for the first time in 14 months, Tokyo stock prices had bounced higher, and there were stirrings in the housing market. But a fresh flow of unfavourable statistics suggests that the early optimism was unwarranted. New car sales in July slipped 10.8 per cent from the same month a year ago, marking four months of double-digit falls, the longest decline since 1974. The ratio of job offers to applicants over the month of June slipped from 81:100 to 74:100. Jobs offered by manufacturing industry in June fell 26.3 per cent from a year earlier. The weakening of the job market has eroded consumer confidence. Cars aside, sales at department stores in June were 8.9 per cent lower, the largest year-on-year fall on record. It was a sign that consumers are spending more in discount shops rather than in department stores, which tend to deal in well-known brands and high-quality goods. Bank of Japan officials say the two most worrisome economic trends are the continuing fall in consumption and reductions in capital spending by Japanese companies, some of which invested recklessly during the late 1980s, when funds were raised at almost zero cost and high return on investment was taken for granted. One result of cheap money was speculative stock and property investments which produced huge losses for companies and bankers, while manufacturers were tempted into an unnecessary expansion of production capacity within Japan. New machinery orders rose 24.4 per cent in 1988, but investment in plant and equipment fell 5.7 per cent last year and Nomura Research Institute expects a further 4.8 per cent contraction this year. In a just released quarterly outlook, the Bank of Japan said manufacturers are 'adjusting' to the environment of less rapid growth, and 'building up the potential for future investment expansion'. But the bank also identified one potential obstacle to this recovery, yen appreciation. 'The current stagnant investment in the assembly industry is a reflection of low profitability in the industry, and the possibility that a further appreciation of the yen could trigger a massive substitution of overseas investment for domestic production cannot be ruled out,' the bank warned. The assessment was made before the yen resumed its rise this month. Closing last year at Y124.65 to the dollar, the yen rose sharply in January and then calmed in March. It has appreciated 17 per cent so far this year, in spite of intervention by the Bank of Japan and the government's plea that the movements 'do not reflect the economy's fundamentals'. There are various theories for the yen's strength. Currency traders say the trade surplus, which rose 28 per cent in July, is an important cause, and repatriation of foreign funds by Japanese institutions is said to be a trigger for speculative movements. According to Mr Yoji Inaba, economic research director at the Japan Development Bank, yen appreciation was generally expected, but 'not this quickly'. 'The pace of appreciation is too fast, and there will be serious costs for the Japanese economy,' Mr Inaba said. 'We can see 'hollowing out' in the electric machinery and audio-visual equipment industries. Many companies already have factories in east Asia and can increase capacity there. The big impact will be on employment on Japan.' His assessment suggests the yen's current movements are undermining consumer confidence and job security, and raise the medium-term possibility of lay-offs on a scale not seen since the second world war. As Mr Inaba put it: 'Another year of falling profits and companies will have to start getting rid of excess workers in middle management.' Companies are already shifting production to east Asia, but hoping to keep the highest value-added products at home. Canon is increasing camera production in China, Yuasa is doubling its production of car batteries in Thailand over the next two years, and Ricoh this week announced a new facsimile machine venture in Shanghai. These and other manufacturers, their workforces, and the Japanese economy would be under greater pressure if it were not for rapid growth in China and elsewhere in east Asia. Japanese video camera exports to China quadrupled in the first half of this year, passenger car exports were eight times larger, and steel exports doubled, while total exports rose 51.2 per cent. Attempts to cool the Chinese economy could, however, slow Japanese export growth later this year, while exports to other countries will be hurt by the higher price tags that accompany yen appreci-ation. Mr Masaru Yoshitomi, vice-chairman of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Research Institute, estimates that a 15 per cent appreciation could lead to a 5 per cent fall in exports and a 0.5 per cent decline in economic growth, generally expected to be 1.5 per cent in the year to March. 'If you have strong growth, then a 0.5 per cent decline does not matter so much, but when you already have a sluggish economy, the impact is not negligible,' said Mr Yoshitomi, who retired from the government's Economic Planning Agency last year. The agency is been remarkably optimistic in the face of economic downturn and yen appreciation, as the new prime minister has discovered. Japan's official target for growth, produced by the agency, is 3.3 per cent which, it argues, is 'still valid' on the grounds that 'if the target is higher, the effort will be greater'. Mr Hosokawa needs to gather fresh opinions. If he believes the official advice, the economy is set to recover later this year and will require no initiatives such as income tax cuts or an interest rate reduction or a fresh spending package to stimulate growth. However, Japanese companies do not seem to agree: they have not abandoned their gift-giving traditions without good economic cause.</p>

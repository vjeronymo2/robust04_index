			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / UK Company News: GPA shareholder lock-in agreement 'now in place' THE FINAL go-ahead for the flotation of GPA, the world's largest aviation leasing company, cannot be given without a lock-in agreement with existing main shareholders, according to Mr Maurice Foley, vice-chairman and president. Speaking at the company's headquarters at Shannon, Mr Foley said: 'If any major shareholder does not agree to a lock-in there will not be a public offering . . . the US underwriters will not underwrite the issue without it.' He insisted that such an agreement is now in place, although he admitted that it is not yet 'signed and sealed'. The flotation is scheduled for mid-June and the pathfinder prospectus is due to released within the next two weeks. Under the terms of the lock-in, leading shareholders would not be able to dispose of more than 15-20 per cent of their shares in the first year after flotation. Both Air Canada and Aer Lingus, which between them hold 21 per cent of the company, are known to want to dispose of substantial parts of their holdings in order to finance new investment in their own companies. However, GPA and its underwriters are concerned that any sizeable disposals alongside the flotation would depress the share price and possibly leave the underwriters holding stock. Aer Lingus said yesterday that its position had not changed since last week in that agreement had been reached 'in principle' on the lock-in, but that 'some details still remain to be finalised' with GPA. Other substantial shareholders include Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation (13.48 per cent), Prudential Assurance Co of America (8.1 per cent), Irish Life (6.71 per cent), Investment Bank of Ireland (4.25 per cent) and Allied Irish Investment Bank (3.43 per cent). Irish Life declined to comment saying that GPA had asked for the negotiations on the lock-in to be treated in confidence. GPA is expected to float about 30m shares at a price in the Dollars 20-Dollars 25 range. There are currently 95m called up and fully paid ordinary shares, plus a further 9.3m A shares held by the Mr Tony Ryan, founder and executive chairman. Mr Ryan said that all the directors had agreed to a lock-in for their own shareholdings, although he declined to say whether these are signed or verbal agreements. 'I can tell you I have signed mine' he said.</p>

			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: DESPITE TARNISHED IMAGE, COLOR NANCY HUNTER GREEN IN DEL  MAR  </P> <P> It is early morning after Nancy Hoover Hunter's conviction for tax evasion.  </P> <P> I am in Seagrove Park in Del Mar, in front of a plaque "in grateful  appreciation" of Hunter's "tireless efforts to preserve Del Mar's open space"  during her years on the City Council, 1974-82.  </P> <P> I am interviewing joggers and power-walkers to see if support for Hunter has  dimmed. My small survey shows that it has not.  </P> <P> Before her trial, a Del Mar newspaper ran the headline, "Some Say Hunter Can  Get Fair Trial." That seems to sum up seaside opinion: She's one of us, and now  they're after her.  </P> <P> The fact that several people who were fleeced in the J. David &amp; Co. swindle  live in Del Mar does not seem to have sullied the civic mood. Nancy was a  "green," a right-thinking environmentalist.  </P> <P> I remember her as a peripheral figure -- in truth, more central than we knew --  when her friend and beneficiary, the current talk-show host, ran for mayor. She  seemed aloof and dreamy.  </P> <P> Later, I read in Don Bauder's tale of J. David, "Captain Money and the Golden  Girl," that she had smashed Jerry Dominelli's head against a wall during a  lovers' quarrel. Appearances can be deceiving, I figured.  </P> <P> Why is it that our local malpractitioners -- medical, political or financial --  always seem to retain a core of loyalists?  </P> <P> The woods are full of people who feel the ex-mayor was railroaded. Their  numbers are thinning, but you'll still find some who say C. Arnholt Smith was a  great man brought down by panicky federal regulators.  </P> <P> It's always good for a smug laugh when we read about some politician in New  Jersey being reelected from behind bars. You'll usually see a mention that the  locals love him because he improved trash collection.  </P> <P> Maybe the Hunter case provides a San Diego corollary: We'll forgive anything if  you bring us open space.  </P> <P> Duffy's Littered Exit Trail  </P> <P> Take our sheriff. Please.  </P> <P> * Sheriff Duffy gets mixed marks for his "You won't have John and his burglar  alarm to kick around anymore" speech.  </P> <P> Duffy said anyone who trusts newspapers also "believes in the tooth fairy and  that professional wrestling is real." Professional wrestling not real?  </P> <P> You can bet Duffy wouldn't have said that if he still needed votes in East  County. Is this how he repays 20 years of faithful support, by mocking a  cherished belief?  </P> <P> * Duffy also libeled Canis auereus by referring to his would-be successors as  "jackals who haven't the courage to kill their own prey but rely upon others to  provide them something to feed upon."  </P> <P> Those are good fighting words but rather poor zoology. Check your encyclopedia.  </P> <P> Jackals have gotten a bum rap. They're major predators of antelopes and other  jungle things.  </P> <P> The notion that jackals are only scavengers is just a media myth. Surely the  sheriff can sympathize.  </P> <P> * Sheriff's Capt. Jim Roache has gotten his Christmas wish.  </P> <P> Hours before Duffy announced his pullout, Roache had mailed Christmas cards  with a drawing of a fireplace and nearby Christmas tree.  </P> <P> Attached to the tree is the note: "Dear Santa, Please bring San Diego County a  new sheriff in 1990. It's time for a change."  </P> <P> It Wasn't a Party Line  </P> <P> Oops, wrong number.  </P> <P> One reason the Republican Party pulled back from Carol Bentley late in the  campaign was that a phone poll of several hundred Republicans showed strong  support for Lucy Killea and her pro-choice views.  </P> <P> The logic was, hey, if the rank-and-file are deserting Bentley, why should the  party get bloodied by expending more political capital in her behalf?  </P> <P> When Bentley lost by a mere 1,300 votes out of 121,000 cast, it left  Republicans wondering if a last-minute infusion of money, troops and luminaries  could have tilted the election in her favor.  </P> <P> Now it turns out there was a problem with the poll that had convinced the party  that Bentley was a big loser and not worth the extra effort. The voters being  called were Democrats, not Republicans. Operatives are trying to figure out how  such a snafu happened.  </P></p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: Barlow posts 6% rise to R273m Barlow, the South African conglomerate formed last year after the restructuring of South Africa's Barlow Rand group, reported a 6 per cent rise in operating profit before interest to R273m (Dollars 74m), from a pro forma total of R256m for the same period last year. After-tax profit, which includes R23m abnormal profit from the sale of the group's investment in Randgold and Exploration and R68m in investment income, rose 40 per cent to R194m from R139m. However, this did not include an extraordinary loss of R62m resulting largely from the sale of the agricultural interests of lossmaking subsidiary Finanzauto, the Spanish Caterpillar dealer, for R189m, which was taken below the line in accordance with the company's accounting procedure. The higher overall earnings were the result of improved operating margins and the group's strong cash position, which helped reduce the interest bill by 36 per cent to R63m, while increasing investment income by 30 per cent. Turnover, which was distorted by some asset sales during the six months, rose 5 per cent to R6.13bn from R5.86bn and a dividend of 18 cents was declared. Mr Warren Clewlow, chairman, said that it was Barlow's aim to have three times cover for its future dividends. As expected, the largest contributor to earnings was Pretoria Portland Cement, which was responsible for 37 per cent of taxed profit. Other companies in the industrial division, encompassing Barlow's wholly-owned subsidiaries, also performed well. Paint manufacturer Plascon and Barlows Equipment, which benefited from improved mine and construction demand for machinery, both showed strong growth. Barlow said second-half results were likely to be 'at least equal' to those for the first six months. In the longer term Mr Clewlow was confident the South African economy had begun to improve and that the company would be able to take particular advantage of the new government's planned reconstruction and development programme. 'Barlow is well positioned to meet the demand expected,' Mr Clewlow said.</p>

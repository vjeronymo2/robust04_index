			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of New Broadcast and Communication Media (6): The 1m watershed - Cable Television Earlier this summer, Bell Cablemedia, one of the largest UK cable operators, pushed ahead with a listing on the Nasdaq market in the US despite difficult market conditions and at a time when others were pulling flotation plans to await better times. Bell had little choice but to go ahead as flotation was a requirement for creating the company that brings together Bell Canada, Cable and Wireless and Jones Intercable. The combined Bell group, which now has 18 franchises covering more than 2m homes, managed to get its flotation and a substantial debt offering away and raised nearly Dollars 500m. 'It is a significant step forward for the industry,' says Mr Alan Bates, chief executive of Bell Cablemedia and chairman of the Cable Television Association, who promises to float the cable group on the London Stock Exchange, probably by the middle of next year. Since the float Bell's shares have shot up, influenced partly by the decision by Oftel, the telecommunications regulatory body, in favour of telephone number portability. Until now, anyone planning to leave British Telecom to obtain a cable telephone had to get a new number. This made small businesses wary of switching to cable telephony because they did not want to lose well- known telephone numbers. More cable flotations are clearly on the way and with them the creation of a market in UK cable shares. Comcast, another of the top 10 cable operators in the UK is also in the process of floating on the Nasdaq market. TeleWest, the joint venture between US West, the US telephone company and TCI of Denver, the largest American cable operator, is dusting down its postponed London flotation plans. The flurry of financial activity symbolises the growing confidence of the cable industry which has already spent Pounds 1.5bn in building cable networks past some 3m homes out of the projected Pounds 10bn total cost to cable three-quarters of Britain. Indeed, comparatively small franchises that five years might have been difficult to give away are attracting competitive bids of around Pounds 1m a year. The actual average penetration rates for cable television - the ratio between those who actually subscribe and those whose homes or businesses are actually passed by the cable network and therefore could subscribe - remain at a stubbornly low 21.3 per cent. But that is increasingly being seen as only part of the story. The investment community is waking up to the fact that cable is an industry producing three streams of revenue from a single network - television subscriptions, residential telephone revenues and business telecommunications revenues. This is possible because the UK is the only major country so far to license cable companies to compete in the telecommunications market. Salomon Brothers, the US stockbrokers, recently published a study called UK Cable/Telephone: Land of Opportunity. 'Cable television in the UK presents a tremendous opportunity in one of the most rapidly developing sectors of industry today - communications. US and global cable and telephone operators have partnered to build a state-of-the-art fibre optic communications infrastructure in the UK,' Salomons concluded. The number of subscribers has already reached 750,000 and Mr Bates expects it to exceed 1m by the turn of the year on the back of building out of the networks, even if actual penetration averages do not rise. Cable operators think they have done reasonably well if they get 20 per cent of the population to subscribe initially to television only services. Add telephony and the percentage goes up to 26 per cent or higher. Telephony also greatly reduces the 'churn' factor - the proportion of customers who disconnect every year. Already more than 500,000 cable telephone lines have been installed and free or discounted local calls are proving to be a valuable marketing tool. The 1m subscriber figure, if it is reached soon, is an important watershed for cable. It means, for instance , that cable services will be worth marketing nationally for the first time and a campaign is being planned for early next year. More thought is also being given to the quality and range of programmes carried on cable networks. There are already cable exclusive channels such as Wire TV, the Parliamentary Channel and Performance, the arts channel. Mostly, however, cable acts as retailer for the satellite broadcasters such as British Sky Broadcasting. 'There is no doubt that cable operators must start having an alternative source of product other than Rupert Murdoch (whose News International owns half of BSkyB),' Mr Bates says. The process has already begun with the purchase of rights to cricket and World Cup rugby in 1996. There is also the planned launch later this year of Channel One, the 24-hour news service being created for the London cable market by Associated Newspapers. The Mirror Group has also announced it plans to launch a national cable channel early next year with local partners. Midland Independent Newspapers, publishers of the Birmingham Post and Mail, has signed up to provide a special news and magazine service for the Birmingham area. The industry, however, is divided on exactly how the programming initiative should go. Mr Vernon Achber, chief executive of Telecential, with franchises covering more than 600,000 homes, believes: 'We must fill the vacuums and those are in regional programmes - sport and news. I can't see any point in general entertainment going on a national basis.' The majority view seems to be that a more substantial programme initiative is needed to help take cable subscriptions upwards and a permanent company to buy programme rights on behalf of the industry and help establish new channels could be set up next year. Mr Bates, the CTA chairman, would like to see between three to five cable exclusive channels being created over the next couple of years. Perhaps the greatest reason for growing confidence in the UK cable industry at the moment flows from the realisation that many important technological and industrial arguments are going its way. As other people merely talk about the electronic superhighways of the future, the cable industry says it has hundreds of gangs of workmen out every day digging up the streets and actually installing them. 'We are installing two and a half times more optical fibre cable than BT,' says Mr Achber, who points out that the capacity of optical fibre is virtually limitless. It is capable of carrying millions of telephone calls or hundreds of television channels. Cable operators are installing fibre optic cable to within 200 yards from the consumer. If the market for new services such as interactive television and video on demand takes off, then one day it may be economic to go the last 200 yards. Some specialists believe it might not be necessary and that the growing sophistication of the electronics being built into cable switching devices in the local neighbourhood will be able to supply all the new services anyway.</p>

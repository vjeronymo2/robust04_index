			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Joy Gruta and Chit Estella] </F>   [Text] Two suspected members of the Abu Sayyaf Group who  were earlier arrested by police authorities in connection with  the series of bombings in Davao City are reportedly missing.    And to complicate matters, higher police authorities in  Davao  denied having arrested the suspects identified as Abdul Munib,  and Jacob Ibrahim. The extremist Abu Sayyaf Group was held  responsible for a series of kidnappings and bombings in Mindanao  last year.    Senior Inspector Tranjirol Ainin, Sta. [Santa or Holy] Ana  Patrol Station Commander however, insisted he led a team of more  than 20 operatives which swooped down on Treasure Inn, where  Munib and Ibrahim were billeted Tuesday night. The inn is just  a kilometer away from the San Pedro Cathedral.    Ainin said Munib had been positively identified by five  witnesses as one of three armed men who lobbed one of three  grenades inside the cathedral Sunday night, which killed seven  persons and injured 150 others.    The Sta. Ana police commander said the two were also among  25  Tausugs rounded up near the cathedral at about 10 PM Tuesday.    He said intelligence reports had also tagged Munib and  Ibrahim as being part of the group which planted a bomb at the  Fortune Inn in Davao which killed three persons in 1992.    Presidential Peace Adviser Oscar Santos warned against  immediately attributing the spate of Mindanao bombings to  religious fanaticism, saying this could unwittingly encourage a  religious war.    Santos said: "For the sake of the innocent population of  Davao, let us move cautiously so as not to ignite further  violence. We do not know if the bombings are religiously  motivated."    "We may be imputing a Muslim-Christian conflict where there  is none."    Earlier, Senior Superintendent Teddy Carian, regional police  chief, said a group calling itself the New Christian Democratic  Army claimed responsibility for the attacks on three Muslim  mosques allegedly in retaliation to the bombing of the San Pedro  Cathedral. The claim was made in telephone calls made to  newspaper offices and radio stations in Davao City, he said.    President Ramos hailed leaders of multi-sectoral  organizations of Davao City for joining hands with government in  its resolve to put an end to the spate of violence in that city.    "The people of Davao City have shown us how the people,  united and working together, can deal with irrational elements  out to sow fear and hatred particularly during the holiday  season," he said.</p>

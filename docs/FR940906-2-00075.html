			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In determining whether a registrant's continued registration is inconsistent with the public interest, the Deputy Administrator is not required to make findings with respect to each of the factors listed above. Instead, the Deputy Administrator has the discretion to give each factor the weight he deems appropriate, depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See David E. Trawick, D.D.S.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Docket No. 88&hyph;69, 53 FR 5326 (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Deputy Administrator concurs with the opinion and recommended ruling of the administrative law judge and finds that the second, third, fourth and fifth factors apply. Respondent clearly provided controlled substances to addicts to maintain their customary use. This conclusion is not only supported by Respondent's patient files and the information provided by Respondent and his employees, it is supported by Respondent's conviction of six felony offenses in the State of California. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although Respondent acknowledged his treatment of addicts, he argued that he had no knowledge that he was operating unlawfully and, in any event, his treatment was effective. The administrative law judge found that it is Respondent's duty to be aware of all applicable laws and regulations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Walter S. Gresham,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Docket No. 91&hyph;39, 57 FR 44213 (1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, while there was some testimony from several of Respondent's patients that his drug treatment helped them, the record, for the most part, belies this contention. Respondent prescribed and dispensed controlled substances without establishing any medical need other than that the patient was an addict. Even if Respondent were registered to operate a narcotic treatment program as required by 21 U.S.C. 823(g), the prescribing of narcotics would have been unlawful pursuant to 21 CFR 1306.07(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, Respondent had little basis initially to verify that his patients were drug addicts other than their word. He did nothing to ensure that his patients abstained from controlled substances other than those he prescribed and he took no steps to prevent diversion of the controlled substances he supplied other than raising his price to prevent diversion for economic gain. Although Respondent contended that he was operating a detoxification program, many patients had been obtaining controlled substances from Respondent for several years. One patient was arrested for driving while under the influence of drugs after apparently consuming large amounts of controlled substances prescribed by Respondent on the previous day. The undercover visits further reinforce the conclusion that Respondent did nothing to treat his patients' addictions other than supply them with substitute controlled substances. Respondent volunteered to prescribe controlled substances for the undercover detective without seeking any information about the detective's alleged drug use or past treatment. Respondent did not offer the undercover detective any counseling and treatment and the amount of the Restoril prescription was increased on the detective's verbal assurances that he shared the Restoril with his ``girlfriend'' even though she was not present for this visit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent dispensed anabolic steroids in violation of applicable state law. Again, Respondent did not deny dispensing the drugs but maintained that he was unaware that it was illegal and that he dispensed these substances in order to prevent his patients from obtaining illicit steroids on the street. Respondent's discussion with various state regulatory and law enforcement officers in 1987 and 1989 contradict this assertion. As was the case with Respondent's use of controlled substances for drug addicts, he had a duty to know that his conduct regarding steroids was unlawful. In addition to the above violations, Respondent failed to keep any records of dispensing or receipt of controlled substances located in his office with the sole exception of one DEA 222 order form. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These violations represent a significant part of Respondent's practice There is nothing in the record to indicate that Respondent understood the grave consequences of his actions, other than acknowledging that his conduct violated the law. Rather, Respondent made great efforts to justify much of his unlawful conduct. Indeed, Respondent did not cease his illegal conduct completely even after the search warrant was served. The MBC Consent Decree in no way detracts from these findings and conclusions. The Deputy Administrator has considered Respondent's arguments submitted in his exceptions and finds that the administrative law judge's findings of fact and conclusions of law are amply supported by the record. Under these circumstances, revocation of Respondent's DEA registration is the appropriate remedy at this time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration, AC8638085, previously issued to John W. Copeland, be, and it hereby is, revoked, and any pending applications for the renewal of such registration, be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective October 6, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: August 30, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Stephen H.

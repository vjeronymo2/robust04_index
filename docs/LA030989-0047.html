			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Jean Stapleton, who as dingbat Edith Bunker was a notoriously lousy cook on  TV's "All in the Family," is playing one of the TV kitchen's best-known cooks,  Julia Child, in a musical monologue, "Bon Appetit!" Stapleton sings her way  through Child's recipes in the one-woman show that played Wednesday at the  Kennedy Center in Washington and is due to come West next month, including  April 5 in Long Beach and April 9 in Santa Fe, N.M. Child, in an interview with  the New York Times, said she's delighted and flattered by the show: "You can  have an awful lot of fun with cooking. It doesn't have to be serious. . . . I'm  a ham anyway." The monologue was adapted by composer Lee Hoiby from one of  Child's 1961 TV programs. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

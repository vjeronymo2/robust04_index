			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 18 (YONHAP) -- Former President Jimmy  Carter was assigned a mission by the American Government to  convey to North Korea a U.S. proposal on directly linking the  nuclear problem with bilateral diplomatic relations, a Japanese  daily reported from Seoul on Saturday.    The YOMIURI SHIMBUN quoted a diplomatic source in Seoul as  saying the proposal is a "two-stage comprehensive deal" in which  the two countries would form diplomatic ties after North Korea  cleared up international suspicions over its nuclear program.    North Korean President Kim Il-song seemingly showed a more  progressive attitude at his two meetings with Carter since he  rated the proposal positively.    The source was quoted as saying that in the first of the two  stages, Washington would provide economic support and allow the  establishment of representatives in each country in response to  Pyongyang's remaining in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty  (NPT) and accepting special and routine inspections by the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    The economic support would include financial and  technological assistance for North Korea's changing of  heavy-water reactors to light-water units, according to the  paper.    The source said that in the second stage, after Pyongyang  had  accepted special IAEA inspections of two undeclared atomic  facilities to allay suspicion about its nuclear development  program, the United States would be willing to open diplomatic  ties with North Korea, according to the paper.    It is the first time for the United States to present a  proposal that includes normalization of diplomatic relations  with North Korea.    The source said that Carter apparently put the proposal to  Kim Il-song at their first meeting on Thursday.    He speculated that Kim Il-song allowed the IAEA inspectors  to  stay in North Korea and mentioned his country's return to the  NPT in response to the first stage.</p>

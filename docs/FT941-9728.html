			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Fashion: The Global Wardrobe - Going out to dinner / London Once everyone knew what dressing for dinner meant. It was one shade of importance below dressing for a ball. Men wore a formal dinner-suit (black tie, no tails) and women wore full-length gowns which, depending on fashion, age and marital status, might or might not be fairly bare in the shoulder and bosom regions. In modern times, however, there is much confusion. If an invitation does not specify dress, then the hostess, if not the host, will be harassed by calls demanding just how formal an affair it is likely to be. 'What will you be wearing?' is the vexed question which pins her down and makes last-minute changes of mind a source of instant enmity. It has always been tougher for women. They have excessive choice and their peers are harsher judges. Among men, a few conservative diehards may expect other chaps to play by Savile Row rules, but most are, within sensible limits, unobserving and unjudging of each other's attire. Consequently, as leisure-time dress codes have relaxed, men's have relaxed faster and further than women's. To the eyes of a time-traveller from the first half of the century, most private London parties in the 1990s would look rather as if milady was entertaining her female friends and their plumbers, gardeners and general handymen. While women seize the opportunity to dress up, men grasp at the chance to dress down. At well-laden tables from Islington to Chelsea, from Hampstead to Fulham and from Kensington to Crouch End, the chaps sprawl happily in jeans and shirt (T-shirt if it is summer, washed silk Equipment version if they are making a big effort). The women, on the other hand, will have gone to a lot of trouble. Some will be wearing cocktail frocks, some long skirts, some trousers. Some will be bare-shouldered and seriously cleavaged. Some will merely have piled some costume jewellery on what they wore to the office. The majority will, once again, be in black - safe, non-aggressively glamorous. But all will have seen the dinner invitation as inspiration to some newly-forbidden narcissism, some therapeutic mirror-gazing, lip-liner and mascara. The 1990s may eschew vulgar display but, in the female of the species at least, dressing for the occasion is only polite.</p>

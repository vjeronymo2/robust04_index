			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Buwayz: Syrian-Israeli Talks Have </F> Not Reached Points of Agreement"]    [Excerpt] Beirut, AL-HAYAH -- Foreign Minister Faris  Buwayz received a message from the U.S. Department of State  yesterday. It was conveyed by U.S. Charge d'Affaires in Lebanon  Vincent Battle. It deals with the outcome of Secretary of State  Warren Christopher's recent talks in the Middle East on  reactivating the Syrian-Israeli negotiation track.    Buwayz said that "the Syrian-Israeli-U.S. talks are still  remote from the possibility of quickly reaching points of  agreement, even though they are serious and broaching  fundamental issues." He expected "further rounds of talks to be  held before a call for resuming the negotiations crystallizes."    He described the "view that settling the Syrian file is  bound  to reflect positively on the Lebanese and Jordanian file as  realistic."    He stressed that contacts are continuing between Beirut and  Damascus, "and we are closely following what is happening with  regard to the Syrian-Israeli negotiations. And if necessary,  direct meetings (between Lebanon and Syria) are not difficult to  hold." [passage omitted]</p>

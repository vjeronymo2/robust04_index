			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> LUXURY STORES HELP CUSTOMERS LAUNDER MONEY, U.S. AGENTS FIND  </P> <P> Undercover agents said Thursday that a nine-city investigation shows it is  ridiculously easy to launder money by buying cars, jewelry and other luxuries  for cash from stores that ignore reporting laws.  </P> <P> "I think this is the most shocking testimony I've heard in my 12 years in the  U.S. Congress," Rep. Beryl Anthony Jr. (D-Ark.) said at a House hearing after  congressional investigators had delivered their report.  </P> <P> Real estate salesmen, rug sellers and other dealers in high-cost items proved  willing to help them get around a law requiring a report to the Internal  Revenue Service of any cash transaction over $10,000, investigators said.  </P> <P> They told a House Ways and Means panel that they posed as purchasers with cash  and a passion for anonymity, arranging to buy items worth $4.2 million from 79  businesses in nine states over five weeks.  </P> <P> Agents Barney Gomez and Leigh Jackson said they always insisted they did not  want their names sent to the IRS.  </P> <P> "The overall results of our investigation were quite astonishing and indicated  to us a blatant and knowing disregard for the filing requirements," Gomez said  at the oversight subcommittee hearing.  </P> <P> "Representatives from 76 of the 79 businesses we visited expressed both a  willingness to accept cash in excess of $10,000 for the sale of an item and not  report it to the IRS and to register the sale under a false name, a company  name or as a 'cash sale,' " he said.  </P> <P> Under questioning by subcommittee Chairman J. J. Pickle (D-Tex.), Gomez said  that just three reports of cash transactions in excess of $10,000 have been  filed thus far this year in the cocaine-plagued District of Columbia. By  comparison, 200 have been filed in Virginia and 209 in Maryland.  </P> <P> "The results of this investigation are appalling," Pickle said.  </P> <P> "We have a whole category of people who are willing to take cash for almost  anything," Rep. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.) said. "This is shameful."  </P> <P> During the investigation, they visited businesses in Atlanta, Boston, Denver,  Detroit, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, New York, San Antonio and the nation's  capital.  </P></p>

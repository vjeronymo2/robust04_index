			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEMOLITION DRIVE TARGETS STREET HAWKERS, TOO;  </P> <P> KENYA CLEANUP STRIKES SQUATTERS  </P> <P> When the bulldozers came to demolish her shack of cardboard and mud, it was all  Grace Nduta could do to place a sheet of cellophane over her 8-month-old son  before fleeing with him into the downpour outside.  </P> <P> She and two other women found a night's refuge in a nearby nuns' residence  before venturing out again to erect new shacks about 100 yards from the first.  Then they went back to work, gathering scrap paper to be converted into  newsprint and toilet paper.  </P> <P> Consider Nduta and the other victims of this city's longstanding war between  permanence and transience: The scene played out not long ago in the shanty  village of Kanaro, a collection of huts and paper shacks deep within Nairobi's  industrial district, has been repeated in dozens of places across town.  </P> <P> Bulldozers have mounted lightning strikes not only on these shanties but on the  tin-and-wood kiosks of tens of thousands of street hawkers. Around the time  that Nduta was being evicted, about 4,000 hawkers were marching on City Hall to  protest a 9 a.m. raid that had demolished dozens of open-air stalls located  around the city's busiest intercity bus station.  </P> <P> In a statement, the hawkers noted that they had been fixtures at the bus  station for 20 years. "We have lost close to a million shillings (about  $55,000) through these inhuman demolitions of our stands and the confiscation  of timber, clothes and other merchandise."  </P> <P> Squatters and street hawkers scarcely rank as the fringe of Nairobi's  population. As many as 45% of the estimated 2 million people here live in  illegal housing -- that is, homes that are substandard or erected on public  land.  </P> <P> About 40,000 hawkers ply their trade illicitly in a city where licenses are  available for only 6,000. So the latest cleanup drive has further menaced the  already precarious existence of hundreds of thousands of people.  </P> <P> Like all the previous drives, moreover, this one is doomed to fail. Its victims  are all part of the same phenomenon. Every year, in cities all across Africa --  whether Nairobi, or Lusaka, Zambia, or Kinshasa, Zaire -- the city's chimerical  promise of jobs lures hundreds of thousands of people off the land and into the  squatter villages.  </P> <P> Kenya simply does not have the money to finance the construction of the  hundreds of thousands of low-income housing units needed to accommodate its  squatters. Also, attempts to regulate the hawkers -- providing centralized  market centers or standardized stalls for them -- have foundered in the face of  their numbers and unwillingness to subject themselves to the regulatory  bureaucracy.  </P> <P> "Again and again, it's the same phenomenon of trying to control that which you  can't control," said Richard Martin, a housing and development consultant in  Nairobi with the U.S. Agency for International Development. "Nairobi is a big  city, and most people don't have the time or ability to go through proper  channels."  </P> <P> Many end up in a purgatory of unemployment and landlessness.  </P> <P> "I don't know where I came from," says Lucy Nyoki, 23, who with Nduta found  brief shelter in the local Roman Catholic residence, cradling her 2-month-old  son. "But now I'm too old to return."  </P> <P> The remark is as telling in a psychological sense as in a geographical sense,  notes a Roman Catholic pastor whose church abuts the site of Kanaro, the shanty  village. "They come here looking for work and stay on even if they find  nothing," he said. "Meanwhile, back in their villages the family land's been  sold, or cultivated. Their families have moved on. They couldn't go back even  if they could find their old village."  </P> <P> Nairobi's demolition drives are recurring events, often erupting when the city  is putting on a grand event of one sort or another. A U.N. women's conference  in 1985 and the 1983 annual meeting of the Organization of African Unity both  brought on large-scale demolition.  </P> <P> The latest sweep coincides with an unprecedented boom in commercial and  high-grade residential construction in the city.  </P> <P> At the same time, the government has embarked on a cleanliness campaign  connected with celebrations at the end of last year of the 25th anniversary of  Kenya's independence and the 10th anniversary of President Daniel Arap Moi's  administration.  </P> <P> Municipal authorities often say they are clearing the land to make room for  more-substantial housing, but the new structures are invariably too pricey for  the dispossessed.  </P> <P> "The high-rises that get built simply push these other groups farther out to  the margin," said Ezra Mbogori, deputy director of the Undugu Society, which  sponsors educational and shelter programs for slum youth.  </P> <P> Moreover, as in many African cities, the line between the temporary and the  permanent is often a capricious one. Some illegal kiosks are sufficiently  established to boast telephone service, which is often lacking in the newest  and grandest office blocks and homes.  </P> <P> Similarly, some of Nairobi's largest and grittiest slums have achieved a sort  of substantiality that belies their origins as agglomerations of mud and paper  sheds. One of the largest, the Mathare Valley, was the target of repeated  demolition assaults in the 1970s. In the end, officials gave up, and Mathare  now supports a population that includes thousands of artisans.  </P></p>

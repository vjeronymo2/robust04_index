This  was disclosed recently by Zhu Yuli, president of the China  Aircraft Industry Corporation. According to a Chinese military  source, the new-model jet fighter to be developed has been named  "Super 7." China is said to plan to use in principle technology  it has obtained from Soviet-built MiG fighters, but it intends  to introduce Western state-of-the art technology to develop it.  The new-model jet fighter will be developed under the "Takeoff  Plan" the corporation has drawn up as a long-term strategy  through the end of this century. The plan calls for the  production of both military and civilian aircraft. According to  ZHONGGUO HANGKKONG BAO [the China Aviation Newspaper], the plan  calls for 1) developing China's capability to develop and  manufacture turbo jet engines for use in military aircraft; 2)  creating a research and development system to build helicopters  domestically; 3) aggressively importing loading equipment,  particularly electronics technology, and 4) developing China's  capability to design and build a large-type airliner.    According to the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, China built a total of  256 aircraft in 1993, an increase of 24 percent from a year  earlier. The production of aircraft engines grew 27 percent  while the production of missiles increased 53.9 percent. China's  aircraft trade in the year amounted to approximately $1 billion  with imports standing at $850 million. The "Takeoff Plan"  envisions China's aircraft trade at $3 billion in the year 2000.</p>

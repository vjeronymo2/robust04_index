			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Busmen get a ticket to ride on road to riches - A look at Stagecoach's offer for Busways Amid the tea mugs and chip butties in Busways Sunderland depot canteen, bus driver Mr Stephen Fox is poring over a sheet of neatly pencilled tax calculations. At the back of Mr Fox's mind are a new car, satellite TV and a holiday in the States. At the forefront is how to minimise the tax liability he will attract by taking up the offer from Stagecoach, the quoted bus group, to buy the shares he and his 1,700 colleagues hold in Busways, an Employee Share Ownership Plan business. 'Most people want to take the cash', says Mr Fox, whose six years with Busways would entitle him to Pounds 8,500 gross. 'You can't turn it down.' 'It's an offer you can't refuse', agrees fellow driver Mr John Robinson. The 1989 management and employee buy-out of Busways from the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Authority turned Mr Fox and his colleagues into shareholders, but there was no external market for their shares. Suddenly, that has changed; to clinch its recommended share offer for Busways, announced last month, Stagecoach is offering to buy employees' shares, valued at around 62p each until now, for Pounds 4.58 each. The employees, who can choose cash, Stagecoach shares, loan notes or a mixture of all three, are being balloted by post; Busways management, which holds 51% of the share capital, has accepted, but an overall 75% acceptance is needed by July 21 if the deal is to proceed. Among the Sunderland bus drivers, who earn between Pounds 175 and Pounds 244 gross for a 39 hour week, there is no question whether the deal will be accepted; the offer of between Pounds 4,500 and Pounds 13,500 in cash, depending on length of service, has settled that. 'Four weeks ago they were going to fight to the end', says one driver, arguing there should have been a vote first, without a cash offer attached, on the principle of the takeover. 'The money's swung it. Some would sell their grandmother for a bag of sweets.' 'It's called the bird in the hand', says another driver, Mr Keith Bevans. 'Underneath all this they are frightened of what Stagecoach will do. I think the offer is too good.' The implications on income tax and capital gains tax are complex, for Busways shares are held in various employee trusts; KPMG and Arthur Andersen have been brought in to hold advice sessions at depots and man a hotline to explain the calculations to Busways staff. Some drivers may reduce their tax liability by taking some Stagecoach shares, but few seem to be considering any significant holding for its own sake. Loan notes, useful in reducing CGT liability, were felt to be for the management. Taking the cash, spending some and putting some into a high-interest building society account seem the popular option. 'We aren't shares people; we're just ordinary bus drivers', says Mr Steve Hamilton. There are exceptions; driver Mr Colin Johnson expects to take nearly half his Pounds 10,600 in Stagecoach shares. He also has an appointment with his building society to discuss investment. The drivers are intelligent he says, but for most, shares are new territory; many would prefer to have the money, then see what happens. 'It's like having a lucky bag, you just don't know what's going to be there.' Stagecoach has guaranteed maintenance of basic pay rates and bonuses and no compulsory redundancies for three years. Ironically, this has convinced some drivers they should take the money now, lest something nasty happens once the three years are up. 'Where there's a carrot, there's always a stick', says one. Despite this, Stagecoach's Mr Brian Souter, a former bus conductor with a taste for old jeans and red loafers, has impressed the drivers at presentations at their clubs and depots. 'He's amazing', says Mr Robinson. 'He's just like one of us, he knows what kind of hassle we put up with.' Others doubt Mr Souter rose to become chairman of a business with a turnover of nearly Pounds 200m a year by being one of the lads. Mr Souter, says Mr Johnson, is a shrewd businessman. 'He could sell sand to the Arabs.'</p>

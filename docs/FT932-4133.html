			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Italian fraud sparks call for EC-wide investigation THE EUROPEAN Commission has asked European Community governments to investigate the possibility of widespread fraud involving surplus stocks of grain, following the discovery of an Ecu77.7m (Pounds 60m) wheat fraud in southern Italy. The Italian agriculture ministry announced at the weekend that a fraud had been uncovered by 13 commission experts, working with the Italian authorities in a two-week investigation. The commission confirmed yesterday that its team had discovered a shortfall of nearly 260,000 tonnes of durum or hard wheat - worth Ecu77.7m - compared with the figure declared by AIMA, the Italian government agency that paid private silos to stock the grain. The commission's statement coincided with the first day of a two-day European Parliament hearing on fraud in the Community. Yesterday, Mr John Tomlinson, a British Labour MEP and member of the Parliament's budgetary control committee, said fraud could be costing the EC more than Pounds 2bn a year - 20 times Commission estimates. 'The Commission figure is the tip of an iceberg - less than Pounds 100m and of that only about eight pence in the pound recovered,' he said. Mr Peter Schmidhuber the EC commissioner responsible for fraud prevention, will address the Parliament's budgetary control committee today. In its statement on the Italian case, the commission said it had called on all member states holding surplus grain stocks to carry out 'the appropriate inquiries', assisted by commission officials. The commission's inquiry into the Italian fraud centred on stocks held in Puglia, Basilicata, Campania, Calabria and Sicily, all in the south of the country. The commission said yesterday that the exact damage to the EC budget still had to be worked out, because investigations were continuing into other grain stocks not covered by the two-week Commission inquiry. Italy will have to reimburse the community for the sums lost, and the commission added that any other consequences for EC finances would be examined as soon as the results of continuing inquiries had been analysed. The Italian authorities claimed at the weekend that the implications of the fraud would go well beyond the original value of the shortfall, because wheat illegally sold on would distort the EC market. Some silos had also claimed EC subsidies for non-existent purchases of durum wheat, the ministry alleged. The Italian involvement in the commission's inquiry is indicative of the new spirit of co-operation in such investigations under the government of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi.</p>

			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TREND WATCH  </P> <P> Taste A roundup of business developments spotted by other publications. Items  were compiled and edited by Grassroots Research, a unit of the San Francisco  money management firm of RCM Capital Management.  </P> <P> Taste Test: Monsanto's new fat substitute, Simplesse, will debut in Simple  Pleasures frozen dessert late this spring, going up against Breyer's Light and  Sealtest Free Nonfat Ice Cream in a sector that saw sales in 1988 grow 43%,  from $140 million to $200 million. Monsanto is also marketing Simplesse to  other companies as an ingredient for nonfat or low-fat products; Kraft already  has agreed to use it in a mayonnaise. How does Simplesse taste? Comments from a  panel of tasters at the Boston Globe: "Good but not the real thing," "chalky,  slightly furry aftertaste," "tastes like what a synthetic fabric would taste  like if it melted" and "terrific for someone who can't eat ice cream." St. Paul  Pioneer Press Dispatch, Boston Globe  </P> <P> Healthy Chain: The largest-volume, deep-discount drug chain in the United  States, Phar-Mor Inc. of Ohio, is also the fastest growing, with more than 70  outlets scheduled to open in 1990. It has outpaced competitor Drug Emporium and  plans to continue expanding. Flush with a stock offering rumored to have netted  $80.5 million, the company can expand while reducing its bank debt and spending  on general business needs. Chain Drug Review  </P> <P> Irate Shoppers: J. C. Penney's decision to polish its image and go after a more  upscale consumer is beginning to pay off, but now it must placate its  traditional customer, who is older and more conservative. The company received  an avalanche of mail from shoppers irate over flashy new ads and catalogues and  confused by changes at the stores. To keep both sides happy, Penney's  advertising and store ambience must attract a younger crowd willing to pay more  for brand-name goods and still retain products and prices that appeal to its  customer base. Thus far, compromises have been successful, but the real test  will come as Penney attempts to further update its look. Adweek's Marketing  Week  </P> <P> Green Choice: One retail company not afraid of the green market is Loblaw Cos.  of Toronto. Last year, it introduced about 100 "environment- and body-friendly"  house brands under the President's Choice label. The products, some of which  outsell national brands, range from peanut sauce to pet foods, diapers to soda  crackers. While no other major grocery chain has come up with a similar line,  some, including Great Scott! in Chicago and D'Agostino's in New York, are  beginning to pick up some of the President's Choice products. Boston Globe  </P> <P> On Board Again: After airlines raised fares in late 1988, air travel took a  noticeable dive, as would-be fliers waited for prices to drop. Late last year,  however, they became resigned to the higher fares and resumed air travel.  Boardings increased 5% in November and 6% in December. Domestic travel in  December and January showed the greatest jumps since November, 1988. The  increases are also a tonic for the soft hotel and rental car markets.  Pittsburgh Press  </P></p>

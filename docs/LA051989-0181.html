			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BUSINESS PULSE;  </P> <P> SMALL BUSINESS IN ORANGE COUNTY;  </P> <P> BUTCHERS, BAKERS, MICROCHIP MAKERS;  </P> <P> LONE WOLVES ENJOY STATUS BUT STRESS HUNTS THEM  </P> <P> Something has happened in the 33 years since William H. Whyte Jr. wrote "The  Organization Man" and everyone wanted to work for a corporate giant like IBM.  </P> <P> Whyte's paean to big business celebrated the millions of Americans who donned  gray suits and "left home, spiritually as well as physically, to take the vows  of organization." Their middle management values, he wrote, would "set the  American temper" for years to come.  </P> <P> Somehow, in the intervening decades, those values seem to have lost their  luster. In recent years, small-business owners and entrepreneurs have upstaged  Whyte's exemplary executives as symbols of achievement in their own right.  </P> <P> We've evolved from a view that big is beautiful to a belief that small means  satisfaction, innovation, independence. And we have so romanticized the rewards  of small business that we have often ignored the sacrifices of those people who  have turned their backs on security and struck out on their own.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Endless Workweeks  </P> <P> People like Peter Sloan, a lover of literature who found creative fulfillment  by building a stationery business in Costa Mesa. Or Julie M. Caddy of Irvine,  who endures endless workweeks and frequent harassment as she chalks up credits  as an independent film producer. Or William C. Dennis, whose Laguna Hills print  shop provided him with two heart attacks on the road to prosperity.  </P> <P> But even a heart attack can be an acceptable trade-off for true contentment.  "I've had a lot of benefits along the way," Dennis said. "I haven't had to  listen to anybody telling me how to do something, someone in Toledo, Ohio." Or  Tustin, for that matter.  </P> <P> Satisfaction, in fact, is widespread among Orange County's small-business  operators. A hefty 97% of the 522 small-business owners who participated in a  recent poll conducted for the Times Orange County Edition by Mark Baldassare  &amp; Associates said they are pleased with their current business and careers.  A majority of 53% found their current state of affairs "very" satisfying.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rewarded by Independence  </P> <P> And the sense of freedom and pride felt by Dennis are sentiments that stoke the  fires of small enterprise throughout Orange County: 81% of all participants in  the Times Small Business Survey identified independence as a key reward of  owning their own operations; 75% said building a business was a basic  motivator.  </P> <P> But the world of small business is not all roses and romance. To some skeptics,  it represents a modern incarnation of the sweatshop environment that many of  our forebears struggled to escape. Even to its devotees, small business often  means long hours, lots of headaches and little remuneration for owners, and  meager benefits, minimum wages and limited advancement for workers.  </P> <P> So what makes this new breed of businessmen and businesswomen able to endure so  much for rewards so ephemeral?  </P> <P> Studies by the National Federation of Independent Business have found that  small-business owners tend to be "Adrenalin addicts," said Terry Hill,  spokesman for the group. "They have that feeling of control over their destiny  that they don't get working for someone else."  </P> <P> They're also optimists, said Ralph Sabin, a partner and emerging business  specialist at the international accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Whinney.  "Otherwise, they'd never go it alone," he said. "They view the world as how  they want it to be and fervently believe they can force circumstances to be as  they perceive them. They may even be a little bit naive, but that's what allows  them to take on the risks of having their own business."  </P> <P> For the classic entrepreneur, the motivation to build a business is a creative  urge more powerful than the lust for money. Of the participants in the Times  Small Business Survey, only 57% identified financial rewards as a key  motivator.  </P> <P> "It is a desire to build something, to fill a need in the marketplace," said  Arthur Perrone, vice chairman of the Geneva Cos. in Newport Beach, a national  mergers and acquisitions firm specializing in private, mid-sized businesses.  "It's the pride of having the best product that makes entrepreneurs tick."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Studies Put on Hold  </P> <P> Peter Sloan, president and co-owner of South Coast Stationers in Costa Mesa,  was working on a master's degree in English literature when he started his  business. His plan had been to teach, not sell, to immerse himself in books,  not balance sheets. But he had five children to put through college, and his  studies were put on permanent hold.  </P> <P> Twenty years have passed, and South Coast has abandoned its original  900-square-foot warehouse for new 25,000-square-foot quarters and increased its  staff from two to 50. And through the years, Sloan and his partner, Glen  Christensen, have crafted the kind of business for which they always wanted to  work: One where workers are lifelong friends. Where employees and management  spend their spare time together mountain climbing, skiing and camping. Where  there's the time and money to give to and work for local charities.  </P> <P> "Being from a literary background, I see a business as a form of canvas," Sloan  said. "It's a form of artwork, a chance to be creative. You can make it up  pretty much any way you want to."  </P> <P> But there's a price to be paid: A full 60% of surveyed small-business owners  said they work more than 45 hours every week; 15% work more than 60 hours per  week, leaving them with precious little leisure time or energy.  </P> <P> Four in 10 survey respondents said they have experienced health or stress  problems because of their work. A third have run into financial troubles, and a  quarter have had problems with their families or marriages because of  commitments to the business.  </P> <P> Julie M. Caddy, president and owner of JMC Video &amp; Film Production in  Irvine, acknowledges that her workweek typically stretches to 60 hours, often  over 7 days. She talks about the weeks on location without a day to herself,  and the pride she's felt in watching her company grow and gain a reputation for  quality.  </P> <P> But she's reluctant to discuss the toll it takes. "Um, it definitely puts a  hamper on your personal life," she said, delicately skirting the issue,  pausing, then turning the conversation back to profits and prestige.  </P> <P> "For anything good you have to make some sacrifices," she finally said of the  life that has left her alone and, at times, vulnerable. "It's hard being in the  business world. I'm single. People hit on you. It's hard to wear the tie and  blue suit when you're a female."  </P> <P> William C. Dennis is less coy. But at age 62 and with two heart attacks behind  him, he knows that small business can bring big hassles. He is president and  owner of Dennis Printers Inc. in Laguna Hills, a company started by his father  and grandfather the year before Dennis' birth. Other than a brief stint as a  box boy when he was 12, Dennis has worked for the family firm his entire life.  His son, Larry, now runs the day-to-day operations.  </P> <P> Dennis Printing was originally in Santa Ana on a site that a local charity  wanted to acquire so it could expand its operations. That was in late 1977.  Months went by. The charitable organization kept vacillating. The stress kept  building. In early 1978, Dennis said, the group decided that it wanted the site  -- immediately. Heart attack No. 1 struck. "A year later, I had my next one, 2  months before we moved the business," Dennis said. "As the doctor said, it was  specifically stress-related. It had to do with our work."  </P> <P> But would Dennis have done it differently? Would he have fled small business  for a secure office somewhere in a cozy corporate complex? Traded in his  entrepreneur's spurs for the organization man's three-piece pinstripes?  </P> <P> Like 97% of the small-business owners polled by The Times, Dennis' answer is a  resounding "No."  </P> <P> By thinking small, he said, "You're the master of your own destiny. You do it  yourself, or you ask only one person. And the worst he could say is, 'Oh, Dad,  that's a terrible idea.' "  </P> <P> Times staff writer John O'Dell contributed to this report.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MAJORITY SATISFIED  </P> <P> Satisfaction  </P> <P> "Overall, how satisfied are you with your current business and career?"  </P> <P> Not at All: 3%  </P> <P> Somewhat: 44%  </P> <P> Very: 53%  </P> <P> </P> <TABLE CWL="3.54IN:1.56IN:2.00IN:2.22IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW>

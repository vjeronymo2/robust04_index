			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Rolls-Royce The entire aerospace industry is whistling to keep its spirits up in the long dark night of recession, so it is hardly surprising that Rolls-Royce is having a hard time. Rolls' tale of stalled civil engines and military orders in a tail spin has a grim familiarity about it. There is also a sense of deja vu about its expectation that spares orders must pick up eventually. At least the management is now realistically cautioning that civil aircraft are not about to take off. Rolls has also cut its cost base according to its business, and there was a commendable improvement in stock turn and lowering of working capital over the past year. Still, for all Rolls' self-help, others are cutting just as hard, and savings may simply be lost to the market in lower prices. Shareholders may also wonder why the rights issue was needed given that average daily borrowings were less than Pounds 100m last year. Perhaps a combination of Trent engine development costs, corrosive restructuring provisions, and the need to help finance industrial power projects demanded a strengthened balance sheet. If so, extension of the logic suggests that the company might do better as part of a much larger whole. Certainly the low returns to shareholders since flotation argues that there is a need for alternative methods to finance the needs of such long-term capital intensive industries.</p>

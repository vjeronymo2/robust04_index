A regular round of Russo-Latvian talks began here on Monday.    The two delegations reached an agreement on social welfare  guarantees for the retired Russian military. According to the  agreement, those of them who permanently resided in Latvia as of  January 28, 1992, are "guaranteed the right to unhindered  residence in Lithuania and use of their movable property and  real estate".    The agenda for the current round of talks includes  discussions of an agreement on Russian troop withdrawal from  Latvia and an agreement on legal status, conditions, terms and  order of work of the Russian radar station in Skrunda.</p>

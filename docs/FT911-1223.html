			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Indian Elections: Caste struggle strangles poor, corrupt Bihar - State administration has broken down and violence is a threat to the election DRIVING through the relentless heat of Bihar, one is soon made aware how much this part of the northern Hindi belt has been engulfed in a power struggle between castes, one that has already led to breakdown of the state administration and which now threatens to drown India's election in violence. At Masaurhi, north of the Ganges and close to Muzaffarpur, a group of harijans (untouchables) point to their bamboo and thatched homes that were burnt down by local landlords a few days before. The harijans say they were seeking an increase in their wages of Rs 3-10 (9-30p) a day. Nearby landlords of the Bhumihar caste - the dominant upper caste in the Muzaffarpur area - unite in a conspiracy of silence and say they know nothing of the incident. In Muzaffarpur itself, most colleges and universities - as elsewhere in Bihar - are closed because teachers have not been paid for three or four months. The Bihar state government, which has the reputation of being the most corrupt and ill-managed in the country, has run out of funds. Returning to Patna at night, we are regularly stopped by police checking for arms. The local papers are full of reports of booming business among village arms makers ahead of the election. Since campaigning began there have been at least 50 political assassinations, which has raised the question of whether the state will be brought under direct rule from Delhi before the elections, due to take place during the week of May 20 to May 26. 'There is no administration in Bihar, no law and order,' says Mr Raganath Pandey, a local Brahmin and former transport contractor who is the Congress party's candidate. 'Nobody is safe.' His opponents laugh at this profession of righteousness from a man who in the past has faced criminal charges and whose election strength lies largely in the support he has from the region's underworld bosses. The founding fathers of Indian independence had hoped that caste differences would melt away under the impact of development and modernisation. But in Bihar, as in much of the Hindi-speaking belt of north India, the competition for jobs and resources has hardened caste divisions. The big battleground is between the traditionally dominant upper castes of Brahmins, Bhumihars and Rajputs - and the increasingly aggressive farmer castes of Yadavs, Kurmis and Keoris who are challenging their control over the power and patronage of government. This power struggle was intensified last year by former Prime Minister V P Singh's announcement that 27 per cent of central government jobs would be reserved for these so called 'backward castes'. Job reservation for the poor  -a term used to embrace all the lower castes, untouchables and Moslems - has since become the central plank of his Janata Dal party's election campaign. This has earned Mr Singh the hatred of the upper castes. A second factor that has deepened caste conflict in Bihar is that a backward caste leader has taken over as chief minister of the state. In the year he has been chief minister, Mr Laloo Prasad Yadav has openly deployed the power and patronage of the state to his community's advantage. Dr CPN Thakur, a leader of the Bhumihar community in Muzaffarpur, sums up upper caste fears and resentments by saying: 'Everything is at stake. Life, prestige and property.' Muzaffarpur is a test case of this power struggle between castes because it is a prestige constituency. It has sent national leaders to the parliament in the past and has been the breeding ground of several national movements. Mr George Fernandes, the former industry and railway minister and the Janata Dal politician who most sees himself as a revolutionary, has held the seat in three of the last four elections. He is contesting it this time and is thought likely to win. Muzaffarpur - part of the fertile region between the Himalayas and the Ganges - is also a stronghold of the Bhumihar caste, who claim to have the same status as Brahmins. They account for 25 per cent of the population. Yadavs, the most militant of the backward castes, are the next largest community - thus sharpening the rivalry between the two. For the first time since independence, however, Mr Singh's success in making job reservation the central issue here means voting is expected to be polarised on caste lines. Upper castes are backing the Congress and the backward castes the Janata Dal. Previous elections have been characterised by considerable voting across caste lines, with many Bhumihars supporting the Janata Dal party and lower-caste groups the Congress. Growing caste tensions have been accompanied by rising violence. Rioting by upper-caste youths against job reservation did more damage in Muzaffarpur than in any other city in Bihar. Unemployment is so high in Bihar that only 20 per cent of graduates find jobs. Backward castes also appear to have been indulging in the killing of upper-caste boys. Dr Thakur cites seven recent cases of Bhumihars being stopped on country roads and shot after revealing their caste. The hope of the upper castes is that a Congress government in Delhi would overthrow the Bihar state government and slow the pace of reservation. The Yadavs and backward castes look to a Janata Dal victory to accelerate what they call 'social justice'. They do not seem to be much concerned at the damage which growing caste conflict is inflicting on the state's economy or its education system. 'Nobody is thinking about that. Nobody bothers,' says Professor Arun Kumar Sinha, a local Janata Dal leader. 'We are deep in a social struggle.'</p>

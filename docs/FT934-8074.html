			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: GA at Pounds 206m but shares fall GENERAL Accident, the Perth-based composite insurance company, provoked a negative response from the markets yesterday, despite reporting pre-tax profits of Pounds 206.1m for the first nine months of 1993. The result, which compared with losses of Pounds 35.1m at the same stage last year, disappointed some expectations and the shares closed 33p lower at 658p. 'People have got used to forecasts being regularly beaten by GA. This is the first set of figures to disappoint,' said Mr Steven Bird, analyst with Smith New Court, the securities house. The fall was mainly due to market perceptions, added Mr Bird, pointing out that GA has been trading with the biggest premium to net asset value of any company in the insurance sector. Mr Nelson Robertson, chief executive, said GA was 'pretty pleased with the result. The market will have to make up its own mind.' The dominant feature of the result was a turnround in the UK where underwriting profits of Pounds 27.7m (Pounds 133.1m loss) were achieved by a combination of higher premiums and more selective underwriting. Premiums have stopped increasing in motor and household insurance, but continue to rise by between 10 per cent and 15 per cent in commercial lines business. Underwriting profits of Pounds 24m were recorded on personal lines business in the third quarter when GA posted an operating ratio (claims plus expenses as a percentage of premiums) of only 72.27 per cent on its homeowners' business. Overseas, results in Canada were adversely affected by losses of Pounds 10m from rainstorms affecting Winnipeg and Manitoba in August. Worldwide general business premium income amounted to Pounds 3.12bn (Pounds 2.86bn). Income from long-term business amounted to Pounds 607m (Pounds 555.4m). Investment income less interest on loans amounted to Pounds 354.1m (Pounds 329m). Underwriting losses fell to Pounds 173.3m (Pounds 374.4m), long-term business profits rose to Pounds 30.9m (Pounds 22.4m) and estate agency losses fell to Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 12.1m). GA has transferred ownership of its life company from General Accident Fire and Life Assurance Corporation, the group's principle non-life insurance subsidiary, to the parent company. The transfer will increase the reported current solvency margin worldwide by about eight percentage points. Before the change solvency amounted to 52.7 per cent. See Lex</p>

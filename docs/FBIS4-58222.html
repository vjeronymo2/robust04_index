			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yusuf Bin-'Alawi Bin-'Abdallah, minister of </F> state for foreign affairs, by Husayn 'Abd-al-Ghani in Muscat;  date not given]    [Excerpts] ['Abd-al-Ghani] Some Arab states have  criticized the fact that you have hosted a meeting of the Water  Committee including an Israeli delegation for the first time in  an Arab Gulf state. Some have accused you of trying to drag or  persuade the Gulf states to normalize relations with Israel.  What is your reaction to these charges?    [Bin-'Abdallah] That criticism did not come as a surprise to  us. On the contrary, we see it as something natural and  expected. We are aware of the phrases used in that criticism.  We view it as a part of the serious thinking about the peace  process. That criticism was made because of these states'  interest in establishing peace. [passage omitted] As I said,  we are not annoyed by such criticism which we believe is  natural. It will not affect our relations, links, and absolute  support for the other Arab states, especially Syria, Lebanon,  Jordan, and the Palestinians. We do so despite the fact that  the press in these states criticized the presence of an Israeli  delegation in Muscat as part of the international working team  within the Water Committee. We do not have a complex about such  criticism. I believe that the fraternal states adjacent to  Israel have to say these things because their cricumstances and  political positions on the peace process necessitate such  statements by them.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] You have held direct meetings with the  Israeli delegation.... It has been claimed that Oman might  start establishing bilateral relations with Israel gradually,  say by exchanging delegations, particularly in the spheres of  water and agriculture. Has an agreement to that effect been  reached between you and Israel, and have you kept a channel of  contact open?    [Bin-'Abdallah] The talks with the Israeli delegation did  not go beyond the multilateral negotiations. We were crystal  clear and meant to be so. In my interview with the Israeli  press and television I stated very clearly that the Israeli  leaders should not expect such steps by the Arab states before a  comprehensive and lasting peace is established with the  neighboring Arab states. I believe there is no room for  confusion or misunderstanding at all. We explained clearly that  neither Oman, the Arab Gulf states, nor any other Arab state  would be willing to establish any kind of diplomatic contacts  with Israel before the latter honors its commitments under the  peace process and before withdrawal (from the occupied  territories) and implementation of the Security Council  resolutions agreed upon in the context of the peace process.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Oman got the Water Committee's approval for  it to set up an international center for the development of  water desalination technology. Will you permit the presence of  Israeli experts in it or the use of Israeli research and  technology in its activities before the political peace process  through the bilateral committees is completed?    [Bin-'Abdallah] It is going to be an international water  research center. All the Arab and other states in the Middle  East will benefit from it. We do not expect results regarding  that center in the immediate future. There are separate  advanced research activities in the United States, Japan,  Russia, and Western Europe. It has also been reported that  there are advanced desalination researches in Israel and South  Africa. I mean that the advanced industrial states have  researches in this fields and we intend to benefit from all that  and turn the theoretical part of them into applied technology.  If there is some useful research in Israel then that would be a  scientific issue and has nothing to do with politics, and we  separate scientific issues from political issues. I believe  that this matter will take some time and we expect the peace  process to be completed before we can get these separate  technologies. [passge omitted]    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Are there any differences within the Gulf  Cooperation Council [GCC] over the question of some states  hosting meetings of multilateral committees with the  participation of Israeli delegations?    [Bin-'Abdallah] I will not be saying anything new in this  connection. It had been understood in the Madrid context that  Israel wished the meetings to be held in the Middle East but the  Arab states were not convinced. Then there was an understanding  that the multilateral negotiations could be moved to the Middle  East once practical steps were taken in the bilateral  negotiations. It was not specified whether such steps should be  taken collectively on all fronts or separately. When the  Declaration of Principles between the PLO and Israel was signed,  that was seen as a positive step in the right direction in the  direct negotiations...and it was seen as a pointer and as a step  on the basis of which multilateral negotiations could be moved  to the Middle East, and that is what happened. [passage omitted]    There are no differences on this matter but perhaps the  willingness to host such conferences in the presence of an  Israeli delegation within the committees differs from one state  to another because of different circumstances and concepts but  there is absolutely no disagreement within the GCC on the issue  of hosting multilateral committees.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] The question of your relations with Israel  is linked to the vision of the region's future you once  outlined, which was quoted by an Egyptian paper, to the effect  that the Arabic language, Arabism, and the Arab system were  finished and that the geographical reality which should be  addressed was now the Middle East. Does this mean that you now  seek abolition of the Arab regional system and institutions such  as the Arab League and wish to replace them with a Middle  Eastern system including non-Arab states such as Iran, Israel,  and Turkey?    [Bin-'Abdallah] First of all, what the Egyptian paper  AL-JUMHURIYAH published in the name of its editor did not quote  me accurately. The Arabic language exists. It is the language  of the Koran. Nobody can deny that, but what I said then was  that our use of the Arabic language was not up to the ideal  level, and if we maintain that the Arabic language is the  leading ideological and political language then we use it better  in order to be able to express ourselves clearly like the other  now international languages. AL-JUMHURIYAH confused the Middle  East concept with the Arabic language concept.    What I mean to say is that the Middle East concept does not  negate the Arab concept. On the contrary, the Arabs own the  Middle East but we should not appear to be racist, and Arab  nationalism or Arabism should not appear to be a racist  phenomenon. [passage omitted]    ['Abd-al-Ghani] In other words, you are not calling for the  abolition of the Arab League?    [Bin-'Abdallah] The Arab League is still the right  institution for the Arabs. We all agree on that but it may not  be able to fulfill Arab needs in the next century in view of the  international groupings. Although we established the Arab  League over 40 years ago, we have been unable to create common  interests for the Arab League. The Arab league was originally  formed for the liberation of Palestine. [passage omitted] Now  that the Palestinian question and the Middle East conflict are  on their way to a settlement in harmony with the new world, the  Arab League should not remain within the confines of the past,  otherwise it would be ineffective once the Palestinian question  and the Arab-Israeli conflict are resolved. The Arab League  would be ineffective if it does not develop.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] You have agreed to lift the indirect boycott  of Israel at some levels. Have you in Oman actually begun  abolishing the the second and third degree boycott measures? Do  you believe that interests should replace pan-Arab links in the  region and that your relations with Israel, for instance, should  be on an equal level with your relations with the Arab states if  the interests were the same?    [Bin-'Abdallah] First of all, interests should be the basis  of relations between states, even between the Arab states,  because common interests are the basis of the links between them.    Second, the issue of the second- and third-level boycott has  no direct connection with Israel. These were measures taken by  the Arab states to underscore their dissatisfaction with the way  other states treated Israel. But the situation now is quite  different. The Western states, the United States, and the  industrial states in general have now passed legislation  forbidding all industrial and commercial establishments from  responding to the second and third Arab boycott levels. That  means that if we maintain the second and third boycott levels  against foreign companies which deal with Israel, we would be  halting the wheel of development in our own countries. That  would be highly detrimental to our countries. We are developing  countries whose industrial progress depends primarily on the  machines, equipment, and expertise we import from the major  industrial states. So we have had to respond to the  legislations introduced in these states.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Oman's position on the situation in the  Gulf region is known, particularly the need to reconsider the  position on Iraq. How do you now view Iraq's chances of getting  approval for a gradual lifting of the sanctions imposed on it,  particularly as it has complied with most UN resolutions and  renounced its claims to Kuwait?    [Bin-'Abdallah] The lifting of the sanctions against Iraq  falls within the jurisdiction of the Security Council and we  know that the power there is in the hands of the permanent  members. Lifting the sanctions requires a Security Council  resolution. It is quite clear that the members are not prepared  to lift the sanctions in one go before Iraq fully complies with  all the resolutions and conditions of the Council. [passage  omitted]    It is true that Iraq has indicated in one way or another  recently that it no longer considers Kuwait to be a part of  Iraq, but is that enough, politically? It may be important to  understand that such statements are perhaps seen as politically  insufficient to end the existing differences between the GCC  states and Iraq. We believe that Iraq should do more. We do not  wish to get into an argument as to which comes first, the cart  or the horse.    Kuwait is an independent sovereign state with  internationally  recognized borders confirmed by the Security Council. These  matters are not open to discussion or argument and cannot be  questioned or reconsidered. Iraq should realize that its  protection from the various dangers which they call "foreign  plots" would depend on Arab support for Iraq. Such support  appears to be nonexistent at present. Iraq should fully  reconsider its Arab policies and its concept of inter-Arab  relations. If it does that and if it commits itself to new  policies toward the Gulf states and the other Arab states, Iraq  would then be able to feel that the Arab states could provide it  with the cover that might help it avert the so-called foreign  plots. [passage omitted]    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Some people believe that the Arab states  have not done enough to prevent what appears to be  "international tampering" with Iraq's unity. Do you in Oman  have any worries regarding the Kurdish government in northern  Iraq? Have you received or met with any Iraqi opposition  delegations?    [Bin-'Abdallah] The first responsibility falls on the  shoulders of Iraq and not the Arab states. That is why we say:  If Iraq reassesses its Arab relations and policies in a manner  that would make the Arabs trust these policies and not see them  as just tactics, we believe that the Arab states would then  become an element of strength in that respect. As regards the  Kurdish issue, it is full of complications, and views on it  differ. True, if northern Iraq is separate from the country,  the matter would not stop there, it would continue, particularly  as there are various minorities in the region, but nobody would  feel happy about anything of that kind. Iraq's current  circumstances, however, mean such matters are to be expected.  If it did occur, it would not occur easily and would lead to  new tragedies.    We in the GCC have, in every session, declared that we are  against any violation of Iraq's unity and territorial integrity.  That is a firm principle. As regards the Iraqi opposition, the  firm principle in the general policy of the Sultanate of Oman is  that we do not interfere in the internal affairs of others even  if we disagree with them. [passage omitted]    ['Abd-al-Ghani] There has been no improvement in  Iranian-Gulf relations. That expectation for which you in Oman  made great efforts, has not materialized. In fact, there may  have been a deterioration since the islands crisis with the  United Arab Emirates [UAE].    [Bin-'Abdallah] The GCC states and Iran always express a  genuine desire to develop bilateral relations to levels that  would be in their mutual interests. That is the constant  policy. As regards differences between GCC states and Iran,  that is normal. Differences do occur between neighboring states.  What is important is the ability to prevent it from reaching  the point of explosion. On all the disputed issues between the  GCC states and Iran, there is a desire to settle them by  peaceful means and at bilateral levels. So, there is no  deterioration, but the agreement that every state should tackle  its issues with Iran bilaterally perhaps gives the impression  that there is no collective action.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Do Oman's decision to withdraw its members  from the military committee in Yemen and your statement after  the Salalah meeting between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and  his deputy 'Ali Salim al-Bid mean that the Sultanate is washing  its hands of the attempts to resolve the Yemeni crisis? Will  you support the Egyptian-UAE initiative?    [Bin-'Abdallah] It is not true that Oman has washed its  hands of helping to resolve the Yemeni crisis. We have never  said that. It was a press allegation. We ended our work in the  military committee because that work was completed. That is a  Yemeni committee which continues to exist but the work left for  it to do is up to the Yemeni side. There is no longer a need  for the presence of Oman and Jordanian officers. [passage  omitted] We would support any Arab efforts by the brothers in  Egypt, Oman, or any other country. What is important to us is  that Yemen should remain united and stable.

			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A COACH TO BASH ONE  </P> <P> Regarding Alma Kenyon's challenge to all of Terry Donahue's detractors to take  up coaching and see if they could do better, I quote Samuel Johnson on  criticism: "You may scold a carpenter who has made you a bad table, though you  cannot make a table, it is not your trade to make tables."  </P> <P> It doesn't take an Al Davis to realize that Donahue has the motivational skills  of a piece of toast (dry).  </P> <P> And if Terry needs some laughs, I taped the Arizona game.  </P> <P> SCOTT ANSELL, Los Angeles  </P></p>

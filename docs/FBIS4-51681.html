			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 27 KYODO -- Japanese companies plan to  cut their capital spending for the third straight year in fiscal  1994 but the declines are shrinking, the government said  Wednesday [27 April].    The quarterly Economic Planning Agency report also found  growing hopes of an economic recovery, but an official cautioned  that it would be hasty to read the survey as showing the economy  hitting bottom in its longest postwar recession.    Companies plan to cut their spending on plant and equipment  by 9.2 percent to 40 trillion yen in the fiscal year that  started this month, the third year of declines in a row but  narrowing from the fiscal 1993 cutback of 10.3 percent, the  survey found.    Manufacturers' capital spending plans were down 17.6 percent  for the third straight drop, compared with the previous year's  18.7 percent decline, while nonmanufacturers plan a second  straight cutback, with the decline narrowing to 5.0 percent from  5.5 percent.    The agency canvassed 4,550 companies with capital of at  least  100 million yen on March 1, with 4,304 responding.    The agency's Business Survey Index found sentiment on the  economy registering minus 3 for the April-June quarter, an  improvement from the previous quarter's minus 22 reading.    "Cautious opinions among corporate managers about the  domestic economy are easing and expectations of recovery are  again emerging," the report said.    The index subtracts the percentage of companies seeing  declines from those citing improvement.    The outlook for the quarter starting in July rises to plus  13, but the official noted that projections for two quarters  ahead have been positive since late 1992 even as the economy  continued to slump.</p>

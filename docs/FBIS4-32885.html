			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 27 May (EFE) -- Enzo del Bufalo, minister  of the Central Office of Coordination and Planning, today  resigned in what appears to the beginning of a crisis in Rafael  Caldera's government.    Del Bufalo has become the first minister of Caldera's  government to resign from his post in the 114 days of the  current administration. Nevertheless, it has been pointed out  that in the coming hours other officials will leave the cabinet  team.    Christian Democrat Caldera is preparing to make important  changes in his government team, which in the eyes of his  political adversaries, has offered an image of contradictions  with regard to his policies, particularly in the economic field.  The changes, it appears, are an attempt to revitalize his  government, which appears trapped between the severity of the  crisis and social demands.    Today, the Venezuelan press points out that all the  ministers  will place their posts at the president's disposal, thus making  it easier for Caldera, who assumed power on 2 February, to make  the changes he may deem necessary.    The opposition has accused Caldera of offering a  contradictory image with regard to the policies that he insists  on applying, and his ministers have found themselves in  seriously contradictory positions. Nevertheless, it is a  tradition of the old-time politician, who already governed  Venezuela between 1969-74, to make his decisions under total  secrecy until he decides to inform the nation, such as when he  designated his cabinet a few hours before assuming the  presidency.    The departure of Transport and Communication Minister Cesar  Quintini has been reported by the Venezuelan media as a fact,  although he has denied his resignation. Quintini is accused of  maintaining a tolerant attitude with regard to corruption in his  ministry.    Rafael Irribarren, deputy minister of transport and  communication, resigned one month ago from his post after  accusing Quintini of obstructing his efforts to dismantle the  complex network of corruption that functions in that ministry.  Irribarren charged that in his ministry, licenses, permits, and  other official documents are sold and that commission fees are  charged for granting concessions.    Local political sources claim that Quintini's continued  presence in his post has created serious doubts about Caldera's  will to struggle against corruption, one of the electoral  banners that took him to the presidency. Other ministers are  unhappy because they believe they have not received the support  they need for a successful start to their duties.    In almost four months of government, Caldera has had to face  a grave economic crisis, with a fiscal deficit of more than $4.5  billion. The devaluation of the bolivar has become a pressing  problem for Caldera. The dollar, which at the beginning of the  month had been valued at 127.15 bolivares, this past Wednesday  was valued at 175.    It appears that Development Minister Luis Carlos Palacios  and  Agriculture Minister Ciro Fonseca Anez could also leave the  government.</p>

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Ethiopia goes to the polls Ethiopians are pictured examining election posters during Sunday's election for 547 members to a constituent assembly, Reuter reports from Addis Ababa. Officials said 90 per cent of registered voters turned out for the assembly elections, an important stage in entrenching democracy after centuries of feudal rule followed by Marxist dictatorship. 'It was a smooth sail all the way. We are happy about the way it was conducted,' said Mr Samson Gethahun, legal affairs head of Ethiopia's Electoral Board. A total of 15m of Ethiopia's 50m people were registered to vote. Provisional results should be known later this week. A main issue in the draft constitution to be debated by the elected members is whether it should include a provision on the right of Ethiopia's regions to self-determination. Some opposition parties, which draw most support from the Amhara ethnic group in the capital, boycotted the polls because they believe the new constitution could fragment one of Africa's most ancient empires. The Red Sea province of Eritrea seceded last year after opting overwhelmingly for independence in a self-determination referendum after years of civil war. President Meles Zenawi and his then-guerrilla movement, the Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Force, overthrew the dictatorship of Mengistu Haile Mariam in May 1990.</p>

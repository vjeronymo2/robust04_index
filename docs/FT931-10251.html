			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Shell sells bulk of Colas division for Pounds 72m SHELL UK has sold its road services and building materials subsidiaries to a management-led buy-out vehicle backed by Charterhouse Development Capital. The subsidiaries form the main part of Shell's Colas division. They include one of Europe's leading manufacturers of road markings and have been sold for Pounds 72m, which includes Pounds 20m of net cash. The purchase price is close to asset value, the company's advisers said. The road services business trades under names such as Prismo in the UK and Prosign in France. The building materials company manufactures roofing felts and flooring adhesives in the UK. The subsidiaries acquired employ about 1,400 people. Charterhouse underwrote the Pounds 30m equity portion of the deal. The former management will take a small stake. The debt portion of the transaction, equal to Pounds 22m before working capital, was arranged by Morgan Grenfell and underwritten by the Bank of Scotland. Shell was advised by Lazards. Two other companies within the Colas group, road surfacer Colas Limited and civil engineer Colcon, were not for sale and will remain within Shell UK.</p>

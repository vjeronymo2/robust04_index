			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRAGER ON ISRAELI-ARAB CONFLICT  </P> <P> What the Arab-American community had feared the Persian Gulf crisis would  precipitate -- anti-Arab racism -- has ominously begun to emerge in the Op-Ed  pages of The Times.  </P> <P> Prager's article represents the type of anti-Arab racism that the community had  hoped could be avoided.  </P> <P> To lump together all Arabs and Muslims, of which there are almost 1 billion  Muslims and of which Arabs comprise maybe one-quarter of that figure, is racism  in its most invidious form.  </P> <P> Furthermore, to claim that Arabs and Muslims hate democracy is absurd and  fallacious. Muslim Pakistan had a democratically elected woman prime minister.  The Arabs, on the other hand, have never had the opportunity to develop  democratic traditions. Every single state in the Middle East, including Israel,  is the product of French, British and American imperialism over the last two  centuries.  </P> <P> What is ironic is that Prager advocates that the U.S. and the international  community undertake a military effort to obviate the threat posed by Saddam  Hussein. The irony is that this military intervention is precisely the same  technique that fomented the present circumstances he condemns: Western  militarily imposed undemocratic governments which perpetuate the anti-Western  feelings among the Arab people.  </P> <P> The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee believes that the United  Nations should be allowed to resolve the conflicts in the Middle East, not U.S.  military forces. The ADC endorses an international peace conference under the  aegis of the United Nations.  </P> <P> ARCH MILLER, Board Member, American-Arab Anti-Discrimination, Committee, Los  Angeles Chapter  </P></p>

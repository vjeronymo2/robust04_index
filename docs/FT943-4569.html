			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Code should be adopted Sir, With reference to your article, 'DTI rejects Labour plea' (September 7), one wonders whether the Department of Trade and Industry is the best forum to investigate cases such as Lord Archer's Anglia Television share dealings. Consideration should be given to whether an independent body, such as the Institute of Business Ethics, comprising well-known people with practical experience, would not deal more competently and speedily with these matters. It is unlikely they would need five months to decide no further action should be taken. The Institute of Business Ethics has recently issued a code of conduct, which should be universally adopted. Sigmund Sternberg, chairman, Isys, Hyde House, The Hyde, Edgware Road, London NW9 6LH</p>

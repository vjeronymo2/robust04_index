			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance coordinator Gianfranco </F> Fini by Stefano Caviglia in Rome; date not given: "Fini,  Running for Government"]    [Text] Rome. "The center-right axis has no future without  the National Alliance." MSI [Italian Social Movement] Secretary  Gianfranco Fini is watching the movement between the Northern  League and Forza Italia and waiting, but he is not anxious. He  has made plans to meet with [Forza Italia leader] Silvio  Berlusconi in the near future and fully intends to conclude the  electoral accord on which he has set his sights.    [Caviglia] Deputy Fini, Bossi now seems to see a better  chance of an electoral accord between yourself and Forza Italia.  Is this a real overture?    [Fini] In my view, the fact that Bossi has told Berlusconi  to handle the south, means that he is well aware that this means  an accord with the National Alliance. Berlusconi has the votes  and can form a consensus -- I do not question that -- but, if he  wants his followers to be elected, he must build a relationship  with us. Therefore, in my opinion, the accord is both numerical  and logical.    [Caviglia] But what type of accord can there be between you  and Forza Italia if Berlusconi signs a binding pact with the  League?    [Fini] Clearly no hidden accord. We do not like the idea of  stepping down, where one candidate refrains from running for  election in order to do a favor to the other. If there is to be  an accord, it will be made out in the open. Otherwise it would  be like cheating the voters. On the other hand, neither can  there be a political and program accord after the boost that  Bossi has given federalism.    [Caviglia] Does that means you are setting conditions for  potential allies?    [Fini] I am simply saying that Bossi's attitude has made any  chance of a political accord impossible. We cannot accept the  prospect of federalism.    [Caviglia] So how can you reach an agreement?    [Fini] I think there is room for a clearly stated electoral  agreement between the National Alliance and Forza Italia in the  south.    [Caviglia] With both symbols, one beside the other?    [Fini] That is one possibility, but not the only one. I  repeat, in my view the need for this accord lies in the numbers.  And the result would also be very important because of its  indirect effects. If an accord is reached between Berlusconi and  the League in the north, and between Berlusconi and the National  Alliance in the south, can you imagine how many constituencies  Segni [Pact for Italy leader] and Secretary Martinazzoli (PPI  [Italian Popular Party]) would win?    [Caviglia] You tell us.    [Fini] Maybe Stintino [Segni's home in Sardinia], where  Segni would succeed in getting elected even if he were a pirate,  and not many more. As for the rest, they will have to be  content with about 20 deputies elected through proportional  representation. And it would be the best change for the Italian  political scene.    [Caviglia] It seems that the Center has become your chief  adversary.    [Fini] The Center is the great uncertain factor of Italian  politics, and the sooner the field is left clear, the better.  The "old" at this moment is represented by Segni par  excellence, because he is preventing Italy from having a perfect  bipolar system, in which there are only two alignments. But I  do not think this will last for long. After its predictable  election debacle, the PPI and its allies will embrace the PDS  [Democratic Party of the Left].    [Caviglia] Actually, Segni and Martinazzoli keep on  repeating that they are an alternative to the leftist cartel.    [Fini] That is in their nature. That is why the PPI has  remained entirely in the hands of people like [PPI Veneto  Regional Secretary] Rosy Bindi and [PPI Sicily Regional  Secretary] Sergio Mattarella, who are very keen to reach an  accord with the PDS. And that is why the real centrists like  Casini, Mastella, and D'Onofrio left the party. They understood  that the PPI was not even a real center because it was suffering  from an acute pull to the left. At that point they had to  choose and they are now trying to build a center-right alliance  with us.    [Caviglia] A result that still seems a long way off.    [Fini] Well, the election campaign is clearly not the ideal  moment, because each party roots for its own flag, proclaims its  own identity. But building this alignment is part of our vision.    [Caviglia] Isn't yet another step forward required?    [Fini] From the point of view of values absolutely not. We  have stated that Fascism is a part of history. What more would  you have us do?    [Caviglia] A little self-criticism perhaps as the communists  did..    [Fini] It is not a matter of self-criticism, but of  recognizing the fact that those things have been superseded.  That there is no longer any sense in splitting into Fascists  and anti-Fascists. Nor is there any sense in our being an  alternative to the system, because the system no longer exists.  We want to be able to be elected to power and make an alliance  with the Center, but one thing must be clear: I remain a man of  the Right.</p>

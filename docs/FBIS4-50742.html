			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 19 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Chinese  Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said today that there is  no such thing as jamming of the Voice of America.    At today's press conference, a ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE reporter  asked: According to a NEW YORK TIMES report, a senior U.S.  official who accompanied Christopher on his visit to the Middle  East said that China had agreed with the U.S. side on sending  technicians to discuss measures to stop the jamming of VOA. The  report says that this is another major concession made by China  to win the MFN renewal. Could you please confirm this?    Wu Jianmin replied that the Chinese side has agreed with the  United States to send technicians to China to talk about  technical matters, such as the question of overlapping  frequencies. The study of the technical problem of broadcasting  frequency overlapping by the experts from the two sides has  nothing to do with the most-favored-nation trading status.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by reporter Si Liang (1835 5328): </F> "Detailed Regulations on Land Value-Added Tax To Guarantee  Profits for Investors"]    [Text] Hong Kong, 24 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--News from  different quarters shows that the detailed regulations on the  implementation of the land value-added tax, which are to be  adopted soon, will be more liberal than the "Interim Regulations  on Land Value-Added Tax" and will respond to the rational views  of domestic and overseas investors. The upper ceiling for  investment return and the land value-added tax rate set by the  detailed regulations are likely to be around 50 percent, which  is lower than the original ceiling, and thus guarantees that  investors will make profits.    When China issued the "Interim Regulations on Land  Value-Added Tax" at the end of last year, there were strong  repercussions among real estate investors at home and abroad.  Property developers in Hong Kong and Taiwan, in particular,  poured out endless grievances and reacted strongly, with  numerous queries and criticisms. They pointed out: By setting  the value-added tax at 30-60 percent and collecting income tax,  property investment companies will have to pay 73 percent of  taxes at the high end or 53 percent at the low end, which makes  business practically unprofitable. Over the past few months,  both developers and professionals have raised many views with  the mainland authorities through various channels. Many  property developers in Hong Kong and Taiwan said: Property  investment involves high risks, a huge volume of investment, and  a long cycle of investment. If the mainland authorities  overlook developers' loan interest rates, inflation, and other  factors and deliberately bring down investment returns, it will  be difficult to attract foreign capital.    According to many overseas property developers and  professionals, the speculation and huge-profit-making activities  on the mainland property market are primarily caused by man-made  factors. Taking advantage of their positions to seek private  gains, some local officials collude with businessmen eager for  quick success and instant profits. As a result, the phenomena  of indiscriminately enclosing or approving lands for property  development and speculating on building lots have emerged in  some localities. Even the practice of obtaining "building lots  through favors or brief informal notes" has been observed. This  phenomena has significantly contributed to the dramatic loss of  state-owned land revenue. These problems cannot be solved by  relying exclusively on the collection of land value-added tax,  but should be restricted and standardized by strict measures and  regulations.    On a public occasion the other day, Ma Kewei, deputy  director  of the State Land Administration Bureau, admitted that there  were indeed serious cases of non-observance of the law in the  mainland property market. He said: Most of those speculating  on building lots and making huge profits are those who have  backgrounds, connections, and brief informal notes. These  people can speculate on building lots without using capital. Ma  also pointed out: Some local officials are eager to develop the  economy and have an inappropriate understanding of land.  Thinking that the economy can be developed by releasing land,  they approve vast pieces of land at extremely low prices, thus  providing some foreign businessmen with an opportunity to make  huge profits.    Since the beginning of the year, the relevant department  officials have repeatedly stated that the aims of introducing  the land value-added tax are as follows: First, we must  stabilize land and property market development and suppress  speculation and profiteering so that the real estate industry  can develop in a healthy manner and so that only the best  survive on the market. Second, we must rationally regulate land  appreciation earnings by returning to the state the portion of  natural land appreciation belonging to the state, i.e. the  portion of land appreciation due primarily to government  investment in the infrastructure; and third, to protect the  legitimate business of investors and ensure the legitimate  profits of developers. Although mainland officials are prudent  about the detailed regulations, they have explicitly indicated  that the regulations will fully embody the rational views of  developers and professionals and try as far as possible to make  tax burdens fair and rational, so that developers can make  profits.    As the detailed regulations for the implementation of land  value-added tax have yet to be made public, there is still some  uncertainty. For the first three months of this year, overseas  developers have been adopting a wait-and-see attitude. This has  prompted local governments and Hong Kong and Taiwan developers  to call for the early release of the detailed regulations, lest  it dampen investment enthusiasm and hinder the normal growth of  the property market, which is still at an early stage of  development.</p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Norwegians suffer blackout amid arctic night There is no part of the world, it seems, untouched by World Cup madness and the financial leverage such madness brings, reports Nicholas Woodsworth from Reine, Norway. Earlier this week, north of the Arctic Circle, in Norway's Lofoten Islands, the villagers of Reine received a nasty surprise. Just days before Norway was to play its first World Cup Group E match - against Mexico, tomorrow, Norway's first World Cup match in 56 years - NRK, the Norwegian national television network, went on strike. Down by the docks, in the Gammelbua bar and restaurant, there have not been such rumblings since the introduction of the EU cod quota. (The flairful Norwegians were partly responsible for the England team's failure to qualify for this year's World Cup finals). 'It is absolutely disgusting,' said Bent Henriksen. Like most villagers here, Henriksen owes his addiction to soccer to the six-month-long arctic night. 'The timing of this strike is no mistake. The last time NRK did this was the World Cup in Italy; we had no sound until the semi-final. But when your own country is involved, that is dirty play.' How much does soccer mean to an isolated arctic island of fishermen? A lot, says Henriksen. The season is short, and the Reine junior team have to dig their pitch out of the snow in May. In Bodo, 3 1/2 hours away by boat, the grass in the municipal stadium grows only because of electrically-heated cables beneath the sod. The Bodo team hold the Norwegian First Division Cup. No mere strike, then, is going to stop Reine from watching World Cup action. In case NRK's pictures do not arrive, the Gammelbua bar and restaurant has sent off an order to the mainland for the express delivery of a large screen and satellite dish to receive German television. The management is confident that large crowds of desperate fans - plus increased beer sales - will cover the cost. Most Norwegians believe that if their team can overcome Mexico in their opening match, they may even stand a chance against Italy next Thursday. The real fear, though, is that the satellite dish will not arrive on time. If that happens, there will be little warmth or cheer in the midnight sun of Reine this summer. The team doctor said that, as things stand now, all 22 of Norway's players should be in shape for their opening game, despite an injury scare after midfielder Oyvind Leonhardsen injured his right knee in training on Thursday.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Shim'on Schiffer and </F> Tunis correspondent Orli Azulay-Katz]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres were thoroughly briefed last  night about the outcome of the talks in Tunis. It has been  learned that the sides decided on a series of measures to  protect the Palestinians and increase their sense of security in  the wake of the massacre in the Cave of the Patriarchs.    These are the understandings reached so far:    -- An international presence in Hebron, apparently a unit  made up of a few dozen observers from Norway.    -- The establishment of a Palestinian police unit consisting  of several hundred troops which would deploy in Hebron and would  be under joint Israeli-Palestinian command.    -- Joint patrols to be conducted by Israel, the  Palestinians,  and the foreign observers.    Palestinian observers in Tunis report on the following  understandings which have not yet been confirmed by Israel:    -- Seven days after the delegations reach a final agreement,  an armed Palestinian police force will enter the West Bank and  begin its operations to impose order.    -- The trailer neighborhood in the Jericho area will be  evacuated at once. Three months later, Jewish settlers will be  evacuated from the heart of Hebron and relocated elsewhere,  apparently in Qiryat Arba'. Israel has categorically denied  that it agreed to evacuate the settlers from Hebron.    -- All Palestinian deportees will be allowed to return to  Jericho.    -- The PLO leadership will arrive in Jericho a month after  the deployment of the Palestinian police force. PLO  administrative personnel and a task force would arrive in the  area earlier to make all the arrangements for the arrival of the  leadership. [passage omitted]</p>

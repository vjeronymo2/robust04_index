			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Observer: Burning issue While parliament quibbles over who should pay for restoring the burnt-out ruins of Windsor Castle, MPs might give a little thought to their own fire precautions. According to today's report on same from the National Audit Office, the Palace of Westminster has been without a fire certificate since 1979 when an inspection declared the provisions inadequate. It could be as long as three years before the Home Office Fire Service Inspectorate is able to issue new documentary approval. As if that were not bad enough, the Treasury also lacks a fire certificate. Several departments share the Great George Street building, and there was apparently confusion over which of them was responsible for making the application. Officials say they're looking forward to receiving the necessary paper any day. But given the record of Treasury forecasters, it would probably be wise to pack a wet blanket in your briefcase when going to 1 Great George Street . . . especially if visiting permanent secretary Sir Terry Burns.</p>

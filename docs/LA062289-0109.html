			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS VOTE TO ARM WELFARE INVESTIGATORS  </P> <P> Ventura County supervisors voted this week to allow the county's welfare  investigators to carry guns on a job that they say has grown increasingly  dangerous.  </P> <P> The Public Social Services Agency hopes to have the welfare officers armed in  July, said agency Director James Isom after the board unanimously voted Tuesday  to equip the county's 14 investigators with guns if they meet the agency's  safety and proficiency requirements.  </P> <P> Supervisor Jim Dougherty said he supported the agency's request because of a  public perception that welfare investigators are law-enforcement officials and  because of the investigators' past experience as police officers.  </P> <P> Isom, who has supervised the county's welfare investigators for 14 years, said  the request for side arms is nothing new, but several recent incidents  involving investigators finally spurred his push for guns.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Last-Ditch Chance'  </P> <P> "I thought rather than wait until someone gets hurt or killed to give them a  last-ditch chance for protection," Isom said.  </P> <P> The investigators, who try to track down suspected welfare cheats, say they  have had some close scrapes. They have reported threats and assaults. One  complained that he was nearly run down by a four-wheel-drive truck. Others  report seeing weapons in the houses they enter for investigations.  </P> <P> "I don't want to categorize all welfare recipients as criminals," Isom said. "I  don't know why, but there seems to be more criminal behavior than there was  before. We're not talking necessarily about the recipients themselves, but some  of the people who may associate with them."  </P> <P> Isom said the welfare investigators, 12 of whom are retired police officers,  must pass rigid proficiency and safety tests and attend a course on the legal  aspects of using deadly force before the agency will issue the weapons. The  investigators will then be required to attend regular follow-up sessions, he  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pleased by Decision  </P> <P> Mike Skaggs, president of the Union of Peace Officer of Ventura County, which  represents the welfare investigators, was elated by the decision. Skaggs, a  welfare investigator himself, said that with only a radio for protection,  investigators often feel unsafe on the job.  </P> <P> "We spend about seven hours a day in the field and contact a lot of people. A  radio may not always be enough," he said.  </P> <P> Los Angeles welfare-fraud investigators working with the Department of Public  Social Services do not carry guns, according to a department spokesman. But, he  said, welfare investigators in the district attorney's office do carry guns and  handle potentially more dangerous situations, such as serving search warrants  to suspected violators.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gianfranco Fini, Italian Social Movement and </F> National Alliance leader, by Stefano Caviglia; place and date  not given: "Now We Will Attack Center" -- first paragraph is  L'INDIPENDENTE introduction]    [Text] Rome -- "First, sweep away the center in order to  defeat the cartel of left-wing forces. The rest will follow."  Gianfranco Fini said that he has never believed in either  opinion polls or horoscopes but is going to war in the belief  that he will return home with a fine booty of votes. The  National Alliance leader is so confident as to be challenging  [Northern League leader] Bossi on the latter's own territory:  "Last Sunday [27 February] I was in Bergamo for a rally. It  was extremely cold, but there were a lot of people there... The  League leader will suffer a rude awakening after the elections."    [Caviglia] Let us take things in order. Why must the defeat  of the center precede that of the left?    [Fini] Because it will signify the end of any  misunderstandings. If [Pact for Italy leader] Segni and  [Italian Popular Party (PPI) Secretary] Martinazzoli are still  able to deceive the Italian people and to grab a handful of  votes, then we will have a situation of ungovernability, with  every possible attempt at clumsy pacts and institutional  governments. Or perhaps a new edition of the center-left which,  because of the new balance of forces, will be called the  left-center and have a nonconfessional rather than a Catholic  leadership. This is the surest way to recycle old faces such as  [lower house speaker] Napolitano or [Prime Minister] Ciampi, who  is a man for all seasons. I see that he has now set his sights  on the Quirinale Palace [president's office]. I think that the  time has come for him to retire.    [Caviglia] So do you also think, as many others do, that the  next parliament will be more ungovernable than ever?    [Fini] No, no, on the contrary. I believe that a  center-right numerical majority can be achieved. But in order  for it to become a political majority, it needs to see whether  the League will accept the points that we consider fundamental,  such as national identity and solidarity. This was discussed in  past weeks, but no answer has ever been received.    [Caviglia] Such an agreement seems very unlikely at the  moment. Bossi still attacks you at every opportunity...    [Fini] It is the voters who will decide on this, too. I  expect an adjustment of the balance among the forces immune to  [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary ] Occhetto, a  result that will scale down the League's presumptions by  reducing its vote. The League formed an alliance with Forza  Italia partly in order to conceal its electoral decline. But  the result will be very apparent in the proportional quota.    [Caviglia] You surely do not expect to have deputies and  senators elected in the League's north?    [Fini] I certainly do. How many there will be, I cannot tell  you, but you can be sure that the National Alliance will not be  a force enjoying electoral support only in the south. This,  especially since Bossi is still doing his utmost to make his  rude reawakening even more painful for himself. By attacking us  and the center-right, he is repelling the very voters who have  hitherto voted for the League because they had nothing else.    [Caviglia] At the moment there is talk about a League prime  minister, perhaps with the National Alliance in a position of  external support, or about a minority government. What do you  think?    [Fini] A League prime minister? No, that is impossible for  several reasons, not least the League's representation solely in  the north. It is unreasonable to entrust the government to a  politician who is unknown in two-thirds of Italy.    [Caviglia] So whom do you see as prime minister? [Forza  Italia leader] Berlusconi?    [Fini] To name individuals now means not only to ruin their  prospects, but to set the cart before the horse. This will be  discussed after the elections, in the light of the results.    [Caviglia] In your latest confrontation with Occhetto,  Berlusconi was virtually the sole topic of conversation...    [Fini] Well, Occhetto did indeed always return to that,  perhaps because he felt uncomfortable talking about substantive  matters. Berlusconi deserves credit for having ruined the plans  of the left, which was already savoring victory and which is now  terrified. This is why he is being diabolized.    [Caviglia] Are you as confident about the opinion polls,  which for weeks have been forecasting a victory by the  center-right?    [Fini] Opinion polls never excite me nor depress me. But it  is true that I am confident. There is a new awareness on the  part of the public, and I believe that very few people can still  believe in the center alignment. It is enough to consider the  business of Segni's votes. He is not gathering votes because he  no longer enjoys people's confidence.    [Caviglia] The latest front in the conflict is education...    [Fini] Yes. It is a good test. The left has started talking  about church schools. We are in favor of freedom of choice  between public education and private education.    [Caviglia] You will be competing with [Radical] Marco  Pannella in Rome's constituency 24. How do you view this  contest?    [Fini] I really do not think about it. I will tell you that  I will spend only two of the 25 days of the election campaign in  Rome.</p>

The spokesman stressed in a statement, as the first official  reaction from the presidential side, that "the State Duma (the  lower house of the parliament) becomes a participant in  lawlessness."    "The responsibility for this act of moral violence fully  rests on the State Duma, primarily the parties that initiated  and supported the blasphemous deed for the first time in the  history of world parliamentarianism," Kostikov said.    Khasbulatov and Rutskoy as well as four other opposition  leaders, who were arrested in the bloody attack on the  parliament building, or White House, in early October last year,  left Moscow's Lefortovo Prison Saturday afternoon, in accordance  with an amnesty decision adopted by the State Duma last  Wednesday.    The presidential spokesman said that "it is an outrage upon  justice and a rejection of public opinion and the opinion of the  president elected by popular vote."    "Haste and insistence with which the State Duma worked to  achieve the immediate implementation of its resolution, and  actually to conceal the evil done to Russia, testify to its  encouragement of political extremism instead of striving for  civil peace and accord," he added.    Kostikov stressed that "the Russian president reserves the  right to act in accordance with his constitutional powers in the  illegal situation which has shaped up."</p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Tokyo department store sales fell 7.8% in March SALES at Tokyo department stores fell last month fell by 7.8 per cent last month compared with March 1991, in an indication that the economic slowdown is spreading from industrial to consumer markets. The decrease was the biggest since 1965, except for some months in early 1989 when the normal pattern of sales was disturbed by the introduction of a consumption tax. Economists warned that the figures are an imperfect guide to consumption levels because about 20 per cent of Tokyo department stores' business is accounted for by corporate buying of gifts and luxuries for offices. These purchases have been badly hit by the slump in the financial markets. However, economists say the data cannot be dismissed entirely since it showed declines in sales across the board - by 6.3 per cent in clothing, 4.7 per cent for personal effects, and 12.7 per cent for household goods. Sales of sundry goods, which includes many luxuries bought by companies, dropped 19.4 per cent. Food sales rose 1.1 per cent. Meanwhile, debts of bankrupt companies have reached a record high because of the slump in the financial and property markets. Teikoku Data Bank, a credit research agency, reported that debts of bankrupt companies with liabilities of over Y10m (Pounds 43,200) soared 122 per cent in the year to March to Y7,773bn. This was well above the previous annual record of Y4,340bn, posted in 1985. The number of bankrupt companies rose 64 per cent to 11,767. The biggest debt was the Y410bn left behind by the collapse of Egawa, the Osaka restaurant operated by Ms Nui Onoue, the central figure in a loan fraud scandal. The agency said bankrupt property-related companies left debts of Y2,447bn and insolvent financial investment groups Y1,478bn - both record figures. Tokyo Shoko Research, another agency, reported a similar trend, saying that the debts of bankrupt companies rose 148 per cent to Y8,138bn. One piece of good news came in a report from the Bank of Japan showing that wholesale prices in March fell 1.4 per cent, the seventh monthly decline in a row.</p>

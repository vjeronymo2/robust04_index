The (justice minister's advisory)  Legislative Council is now working on a revision to the  Commercial Law, and as part of the law's revision, is planning  to allow businesses to purchase their own stocks in an effort to  reduce the volume of issued stocks. Under the policy, companies  would be allowed to buy up to 3 percent of their own outstanding  shares on condition they cancel the shares within six months.  The Finance Ministry intends to prepare rules on procedures for  and disclosure of the purchases. The Justice and Finance  Ministries are expected to work out new rules before February.  The ban that prohibits the purchase of a corporation's own  stocks is expected to be rescinded in April 1995 after a  revision of related laws.    Industrial circles and securities firms have been calling  for  the stimulation of the stock market through lifting the ban.  The bill revising the Commercial Law will have provisions to  allow companies to buy their own stocks for cancellation or  distribution to employees.    The Legislative Council has been studying measures for  partial liberalization of the ban, noting: "A full  liberalization will threaten companies' financial status because  it entails returning money to shareholders."    The funds used by a company to purchase its own stocks will  be limited to dividend funds, and the purchase will have to be  approved in advance at the shareholders' general meeting. The  maximum volume of purchases will be set at 3 percent to prevent  management attempts to strengthen its control over the company,  and to avoid ill effects on the stock market.    Companies that buy their own stocks will have to cancel them  within a certain period. To minimize the possibility of  influencing the shareholders' general meetings, the period for  which a corporation will be permitted to possess its own stocks  will be set at a maximum of six months. When purchased stocks  are canceled, companies will again be allowed to buy their own  stocks, up to 3 percent.    Stock purchases for distribution to employees is planned  because stock purchases by employees often causes instability in  stock prices. Stock purchases for cancellation is planned to  improve the balance between demand and supply of stocks. Many  companies increased their capital during the bubble economy  boom, and the resulting stock oversupply is regarded as one of  the reasons for the stock market's prolonged slump.    In line with the preparatory work for the Commercial Law's  revision, the Finance Ministry will develop rules to govern a  company purchasing its own stocks. The ministry plans to make  it mandatory for businesses wishing to buy their own shares to  do so through the stock market and to disclose their purchases  before and after the transaction. The ministry is trying to  restrict the scale to which a company will be able to purchase  its own stocks to avoid ill influences on the stock market --  this is aimed at investor protection.    As tangible measures, the Finance Ministry intends to  control  the quantity of purchases through the following restrictions:  1) The volume of purchases per day should not exceed 25-30  percent of the average volume of transactions in the market; 2)  purchases must be done through one securities company; 3)  purchases should not be done immediately before the close of the  market; and 4) company purchases of its own stock should be  prohibited when doing so might push the price of the stock to an  unprecedented level.    Regarding disclosure measures, the Finance Ministry is  expected to urge companies to clarify at the shareholders'  general meetings when, how many, and at what price it purchased  its own stocks. Even after the purchase, companies will be  urged to report when and how many stocks they purchased and at  what price.</p>

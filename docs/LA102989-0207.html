			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMES FLANIGAN: NO NEW TAXES MEANS MORE BORROWING  </P> <P> Crises, while they sometimes call forth strength, can also reveal weaknesses in  a society -- as for example, the government's difficulty with California  earthquake relief.  </P> <P> The story for now has a happy ending -- relief funds are on their way to the  Bay Area because President Bush signed the law that will allow the Treasury to  borrow the money needed to shore up roads and bridges and to care for people  living in tents.  </P> <P> The Treasury must borrow, of course, because the federal government is already  way over budget. In fact, there was some dithering over relief while the  Administration and Congress tried to devise a way to raise the money without  further violating Gramm-Rudman deficit limits.  </P> <P> But in the end, it was decided that it had to be in the budget, so the  $3.5-billion relief program will add to the $100-billion government deficit.  "It will add to the deficit. Is that preferable to a tax increase? Yes," is how  White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater stated the policy.  </P> <P> On earthquake relief as on other matters, said a White House aide, "the  President's position is clear: No new taxes."  </P> <P> Which sounds like a battle cry, but is really a cop-out. Because no new taxes  means more loans from abroad to fund the deficit. Last year foreign investors  in U.S. Treasury bonds and bills loaned the U.S. government about $48 billion  -- roughly 40% of the deficit (with Japan, the leading lender, accounting for  roughly $24 billion). Foreign investors will fund relief for victims of the  earthquake and Hurricane Hugo in South Carolina. The money has to come from  somewhere.  </P> <P> Which raises a question: If no new taxes is merely an excuse for borrowing --  and creating new interest payments -- are we kidding ourselves? And if so, are  we paying a price?  </P> <P> Increasingly, people understand the answer is yes. But false economy goes far  beyond Washington. According to the Government Finance Officers Assn., a  12,000-member organization of state, county and municipal treasurers and budget  directors, America faces an overdue bill for infrastructure repair amounting to  $100 billion. Infrastructure is a big word meaning roads and water mains,  bridges and tunnels, sewers and freeways.  </P> <P> And the bill for their upkeep is overdue because, like railroad companies years  ago, the cities have deferred maintenance. When voters turn down bond issues  and new taxes, explains director Jeffrey Esser, of the Government Finance  Officers, you use available funds for schools and police and fire departments  and cut maintenance to stay within budget. "It's something you can get away  with -- for a while."  </P> <P> But now neglect is catching up. In Chicago, Transit Authority trains must slow  to six miles an hour in the Loop because the track system can't take the  vibrations of greater speed. Water mains are corroded in New York, and there  are potholes on superhighways all over America.  </P> <P> What is being done? Some intelligent solutions -- voters approved more public  works initiatives in 1988 than in previous years. But state legislatures still  prefer the easy way out. Lotteries and other public gambling schemes have  become a mania -- 32 states have lotteries, Oregon has legal poker machines,  Iowa has riverboat casino gambling. Lotteries alone raise almost $20 billion.  </P> <P> But it's a wasteful way to raise public money. The state keeps only 37% of  gambling proceeds. Taxes raise money more efficiently -- and do it fairly. The  odds on state lotteries, say professional gamblers, are a rip-off -- the bettor  risks too much for too little potential reward. And gambling takes  proportionately more from the poor than the better-off. A voluntary activity,  gambling might be all right if it were only to raise money for extras. But when  the state makes suckers of its citizens to fund schools and safe water, it's an  injustice.  </P> <P> What can be done? We can pay our way. If they had the political will, the  President and Congress could have funded earthquake relief easily with a  temporary 10-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax, which would have brought in $10  billion in one year.  </P> <P> For the long-term, tax experts are thinking of a super-sales tax that would  exempt all savings, tax all spending and encourage business investment. The  intent, says John Shoven, head of economics at Stanford University, would be to  lower the cost of capital for U.S. industry.  </P> <P> Still, you say, the economy is puttering along and inflation is low. Do we  really pay a price for the budget deficit? The answer has just been supplied by  the Federal Reserve, which reports annually on America's wealth -- the value of  all its homes, goods and businesses, minus how much is owed on them. The new  Fed survey, taking a 10-year look, shows that America's wealth increased more  slowly in the 1980s than in any previous decade, because of the buildup of  public debt -- which all Americans must now work to pay off.  </P> <P> Maybe in the next decade we'll stop kidding ourselves with phrases like "No new  taxes" and return to an earlier American boast: "We pay our way."  </P></p>

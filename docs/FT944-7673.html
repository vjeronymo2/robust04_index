			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Survey of Mexico (9): Reducing costs, boosting profits - Multinational profile: Cementos Mexicanos Over the past three years, Cementos Mexicanos has gone from being a local cement producer to becoming arguably Mexico's leading multinational company. In 1992, it was responsible for Mexico's largest ever international acquisition - the Dollars 1.85bn purchase in 1992 of Spain's Sanson and Valenciana - and since then has acquired other significant cement operations in South America and the US, and has raised more debt in the international markets than any other Mexican business. Earlier last month Cemex formally accepted its multinational status by reorganising its Mexican operations. In what may be the first move of its kind by a Mexican company, Cemex established a separate Mexico division with its own chief executive and staff, which, like Cemex divisions in other parts of the world, will report to company chairman Lorenzo Zambrano. 'This is third stage in the development of the modern Cemex' said Hector Medina, who will manage Cemex Mexico. The first two stages of development - acquiring dominant market share in Mexico and buying up cement companies worldwide - have given Cemex total worldwide cement capacity of over 40m tonnes, and a market value of about Dollars 8bn. The new organisation will lead to some cost-cutting as Cemex merges its three regional Mexican divisions into one headed by Mr Medina. With Mr Medina taking day-to-day responsibility for the Mexican operations, the reorganisation will free Mr Zambrano and Mr Gustavo Cabellero, the finance director, to concentrate on the overall global strategy of the group. Mr Medina is confident that Cemex Mexico will remain the centre of the group's activities in coming years. Mexico suffers from an acute shortage of housing and roads, power stations and other cement-intensive projects, and demand for cement will grow by at least twice the annual increase in GDP over the next five years. Cemex already has about 63 per cent of Mexico's cement market, and plans to invest in new production mainly to maintain this share, than to increase it substantially. Such a strategy appears motivated partly by the company's desire to avoid over-capacity and spark off a price war with Apasco, its rival which is majority owned by Holderbank, the Swiss cement group. Cemex's plans of maintaining its dominant market share in Mexico may be threatened by Grupo Carso, Mexico's large conglomerate controlled by Mr Carlos Slim. Carso bought a small regional cement company plant earlier this year, leading to speculation that it might seek to take on Cemex, either by building new cement plants or by acquiring existing ones. Mr Medina dismisses the threat from Mr Slim: 'The industry is in a very competitive position,' he says. 'He would need a lot of money - of course, he has it. But there are other investments more profitable and less risky. Would a logical investor invest his money in such a well-positioned industry? I doubt it.' If Cemex can avoid a price war or greater competition in its home market, then it will be in a strong position to expand internationally. The company's Mexican operations generate about Dollars 900m a year in cash, of which about Dollars 700m are taken up by debt-service and Mexican investment obligations, according to Mr Caballero. Mr Caballero says Cemex plans to use the spare cash to invest in high growth areas outside Mexico, especially in Latin America, but not exclusively so. As part of that strategy the company this year agreed to buy Vencemos, Venezuela's largest cement company, Cementos Bayano, Panama's largest cement company, and more cement plans in Texas. Cemex paid Dollars 1.85bn for Sanson and Valenciana, giving it about 30 per cent of the Spanish cement market. Cemex believes that the world cement industry is consolidating around a few global giants, and that international expansion is the only way it can survive in the long term. But it also argues that it has been able to reduce substantially costs and increase profits of the companies it has taken over. With Cemex executives having worked on four acquisitions in as many years, they are able to see were costs can be cut, says Mr Caballero.</p>

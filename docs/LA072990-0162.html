			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WEST FIGHTS BACK INTO CONTENTION;  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEGION: DEFENDING CHAMPION, WORKING ITS WAY THROUGH THE LOSERS'  BRACKET, ADVANCES TO 6TH AREA FINALS.  </P> <P> After a first-round loss to Claremont, Woodland Hills West was faced with  having to win five games in a row if it was to capture its second successive  American Legion 6th Area championship and earn a berth in the state playoffs.  </P> <P> And now, a determined survivor working its way through the  one-more-loss-and-you're-out losers' bracket, West is only two games away from  another trip to Yountville.  </P> <P> West snapped back to defeat Santa Monica in the second round Friday, then took  a doubleheader Saturday, defeating Culver City, 11-5, and Conejo Valley, 13-8,  at UCLA's Jackie Robinson Stadium to claim a berth in today's championship  finals against Claremont.  </P> <P> Claremont, which is undefeated in the double-elimination tournament, advanced  with victories in the first two rounds. Should West win the 9 a.m. game today,  a second game will be played at 3 p.m. to determine the championship. Claremont  (38-9) won the 6th Area title in 1988.  </P> <P> "We're confident," West Coach Don Hornback said. "We're really on a roll now.  We're really hitting the ball. It would take a supreme pitching effort to stop  our bats tomorrow."  </P> <P> The statistics lend credence to Hornback's boast. West (26-5) combined for 34  hits in both games Saturday and shelled Santa Monica for 16 on Friday, bringing  West's 6th Area playoff total to 63 hits in four games.  </P> <P> "What can you say about Woodland Hills? They hit the ball," Conejo Valley Coach  Craig Sturges said. "You throw it high, they hit it; you throw it low, they hit  it; you throw it behind them, they hit it."  </P> <P> West cleanup hitter Jason Cohen and No. 5 hitter Bobby Kim connected often.  Cohen, after going two for three against Culver City, ripped Conejo Valley  pitchers Bryan Corey and Nick Brown for four hits in five at-bats and knocked  in two runs, pushing his tournament RBI total to 11.  </P> <P> Kim collected three hits in four trips to the plate and drew a walk in each  game. He finished with four RBIs.  </P> <P> Kim, a catcher who played at El Camino Real High in the spring, said that after  the Conquistadores' disappointing loss to Chatsworth in the City Section 4-A  Division title game at Dodger Stadium, baseball didn't seem as much fun any  more . . . until now.  </P> <P> "I told the guys after (we lost at( at Dodger Stadium, I didn't think baseball  was fun any more," Kim said. "How many times in your life can you play in  Dodger Stadium?"  </P> <P> Now, Kim &amp; Co. are on Cloud 9.  </P> <P> "Now that we're here at UCLA, it's just great," Kim said.  </P> <P> West also got solid performances from pitchers Corey Bromberg (6-1) and Terry  Morrow (4-0).  </P> <P> Against Culver City (13-3) Bromberg went the distance, striking out five while  allowing 10 hits and three earned runs. Morrow, making his first appearance as  a position player in six weeks after suffering a shoulder injury, surrendered  12 hits and had five strikeouts against Conejo Valley through 8 1/3 innings. He  yielded to Paul Geller in the ninth.  </P> <P> Conejo Valley (24-11) was sparked by Brian Sturges. Sturges went three for  three, including two doubles and five RBIs.  </P></p>

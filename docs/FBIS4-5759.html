			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Hisahiko Okazaki, former Japanese ambassador to </F> Thailand: "The Future of the Japan-U.S. Alliance: Inevitable  Risk Sharing"]    [Text]Lessons From the Anglo-Dutch War    The breakdown of the recent Japan-U.S. framework talks  should  be taken seriously.    More than anything else, the international situation had an  adverse effect on the talks. There has always been Japan-U.S.  trade friction, but during the Cold War period, they had somehow  been tided over through the principle that a good Japan-U.S.  relationship is the first consideration.    The recent situation of the Japan-U.S. relationship is  surprisingly similar to that of the Anglo-Dutch relationship.  While Great Britain was fighting a life-and-death battle with  Spain, the Netherlands accumulated wealth. And, although there  was serious economic friction between Great Britain and the  Netherlands concerning fishing, merchant shipping, textiles, and  others, Great Britain's fate hinged on the maintenance of the  alliance with the Netherlands. However, with the end of  religious confrontation following the conclusion of the  Westphalia Treaty in 1648, a navigational law was soon  promulgated in 1651. And, due to the Anglo-Dutch War, which was  fought three times since 1652, the world trade empire of the  Netherlands was ruined. If the Netherlands had accurately  grasped the moves of the British parliament and Britain's public  opinion and had made the necessary concessions ahead of time, it  could have avoided the war. Japan made an early mistake,  although it was in the international environment where it should  have learned the historical lessons from the Netherlands.    Of the three agendas of the framework talks, an agreement  had  already been reached on global cooperation matters. If Japan  had fully satisfied the U.S. with economic stimulus measures  that are of major importance, the setting of numerical targets,  which are of minor importance, would have been postponed since  it raised the question of propriety in the United States also.  Because Japan had made a mistake in the management of major  problems, it had stiffened the U.S. attitude toward minor  problems.    It is of course necessary for Japan to make efforts to  improve the situation through such measures as liberalization  and deregulation. Due to Japan's recent mistake, however, it  should be prepared to face the fact that U.S. demands will  become higher once the United States clears the current hurdle.  For the time being, however, I will leave economic issues to  economic specialists since it is necessary to ascertain the U.S.  Congress' future moves. I would like to think of measures to  prevent a crack in the Japan-U.S. alliance with regard to  political and security aspects.    First of all, I do not think that the recent breakdown will  immediately shake the foundation of the Japan-U.S. alliance. At  least, there is no such fear from the Japanese side. One may  square one's shoulders by saying "For the first time, the word  `no' was uttered," but no one is uttering this phrase with  determination to confront the United States in the future.  Rather, one is merely patching up affairs with such an  expression, because no one has the nerve to square up to the  mistake of having given a blow to national life by delaying the  Japanese economy's recovery through the breakdown of the talks.  <H5>  What Is To Be Feared Is Emotional Public Opinion </H5>   When viewed in perspective, what is to be feared is public  opinion in the United States. That is because a view is sure to  surface that is emotionally appealing, although it has a leap in  logic: "Why should we defend a country that is giving a blow to  the U.S. employment situation without rectifying its trade  surplus with the United States?"    Between Japan and the United States there exists a strong  brake that can be applied to such a view. That is the mutual  trust that exists between military personnel of the two  governments, which was fostered during the Nakasone-Reagan  period. For the last 10 years, which decided the Cold War  issue, the two men fought through the war with the Soviet Union  together by digging up Japan's financial resources, which were  the only strategic reserves left in the West at that time.    In addition, such professionals of both countries have a  persuasive belief in the support of a firm Japan-U.S. alliance.    In the near future, Asia will be in a state of flux and  transition, if not in a critical state. The DPRK (North Korea)  has not only the nuclear problem, which is a critical issue at  the moment, but also the problems of succession, maintenance of  the establishment, and unification. In addition to the  succession problem, China has problems in Hong Kong, Taiwan, the  South China Sea, Tibet, Xinjiang, and other places. It will  take 10 years for Russia's internal conditions to become calm.  In such a transition period, the Japan-U.S. alliance is the key  to stability in the Asian-Pacific region. The U.S. bases in  Japan are the ones where the U.S. Forces can be maintained with  the least cost and the most efficiency in the world, through  Japan's cooperation. These bases are more indispensable for the  U.S. role in preserving the international order after the Cold  War than just for the preservation of Japan's security.    However, the United States is a country of public opinion.  Even if there are supporters in the United States who are in a  reliable relationship with Japan and who know Japan's strategic  importance, it is not easy to ask them to fight against a  powerful enemy, public opinion, unless they are supplied with  enough weapons.    Japan should bear in mind that it will have to show an  attitude that makes U.S. public opinion think that Japan is a  truly reliable ally in the face of a situation where the true  worth of the Japan-U.S. alliance is tried. Japan should make  constant preparations for this purpose. In making the necessary  preparations, we may as well set up two hypotheses.    One is peace-keeping operations [PKO]. The United States,  which remains the only country in the world holding supreme  power after the Cold War, is forced to bear the responsibility  for maintaining the world order because no other country is  willing to take the responsibility. However, since the United  Nations is functioning at the moment, it is possible to maintain  world order under the umbrella of the United Nations with the  United States as leader. The question is to what extent can  Japan contribute to such an endeavor.  <H5>  PKO's Come With Sacrifices </H5>   Japan's participation in the PKO in Cambodia was successful.  The operations were a great success because they were  accomplished completely within a limited time period and with a  minimum of victims, which was an exceptional case in the history  of UN PKO's.    What was most significant for Japan was the breakdown of the  myth that the Southeast Asian nations are wary of the Japanese  Self-Defense Forces' [SDF] participation -- this myth was  originally a domestic dispute in Japan and was exported overseas  during the eighties. Concerning SDF participation in PKO's,  there were no criticisms in the utterances of prominent people  or in the press comments in Southeast Asia. Rather, the only  criticism was that the SDF units placed a dangerous task on  other countries, always finding shelter in a safe place.    However, future participation in PKO's will not always be  as successful as the one in Cambodia. First of all, there is no  guarantee that PKO's will always be successful. There are cases  where PKO's will have to be conducted from humanitarian and  international viewpoints at the risk of failure. PKO's will not  always be accomplished in a short time. Cyprus is a case in  point. However, now we can highly evaluate the PKO in  Palestine, although they were thought to have to go on  indefinitely. And, at any rate, no PKO can guarantee that there  will be no victims. Even Prime Minister Goh of Singapore, a  country which is more wary of Japan's military role than any  other in Southeast Asia, told Japan, "PKO's are no picnic."    PKO's are not wars. Therefore, there is no political risk  that holds sway over the destiny of a country that participates  in PKO. Concerning the safety of PKO personnel, they are no more  placed in a dangerous situation than policemen and firemen are.  If Japan refuses to take such a risk, it can never become a  partner in preserving the international order.    Japan should immediately unfreeze the PKO forces that have  been put in deep freeze and get rid of the excessive restraints  that annoy countries that assume duties in company with Japan.  And, when the international community, including the United  States, bears the responsibility for the maintenance of the  international order, Japan should be prepared to face failure or  danger with the world community.    An important test case of the Japan-U.S. alliance is an  emergency in the Far East. The critical situation in the Korean  peninsula is causing the greatest concern at present. Japan is  expected to give immediate and full cooperation in case of the  mobilization of the U.S. Armed Forces. Probably even the  present coalition cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party can  give their cooperation. Otherwise, more than half of the reason  for the Japan-U.S. alliance's existence would be lost, and that  is evident to everyone. However, the problem will go beyond  that, depending upon the development of scenarios. In case of  war on the Korean peninsula, U.S. public opinion will call for  Japan's participation. However, as far as national feeling in  South Korea is concerned, Japan's military assistance will be  rejected so long as U.S. and South Korean Armed Forces can cope  with the situation. However, on the supposition that U.S. and  South Korean Armed Forces face the danger of being driven into  the sea as in former times, if Japan, which has 200 F-15 fighter  planes, remains an idle spectator despite a joint U.S.-South  Korean request for Japan's assistance, the Japan-U.S. alliance  will never hold out.    Can Japan afford to destroy the Japan-U.S. alliance and lose  the peace, stability, and prosperity of Japan by adopting a  theory which is quite unintelligible outside Japan and which 99  percent of the Japanese people have never heard of: Japan has  the right of self-defense but is not allowed to have the right  of collective-defense? I think that the Japanese are a realistic  people and that they will cope with the situation realistically  at such a time.  <H5>  Seek the Middle Path </H5>   After the end of the Cold War, everyone tried to guess what  the future world would be like. A U.S. academic society  proposed two options: Japan will either become a military  superpower in the future or it will play a nonmilitary role  globally. Comparison of the two options is unproductive work  because they do not exist. In the foreseeable future, Japan's  choices are extremely limited. One option: a country that  dispatches PKO personnel but makes them hide behind the French  Army in case of danger and remains a country that thrusts danger  on the armies of other countries; or an ordinary country that  shares sacrifices with other countries. Another option: a  country that says it has the right of self-defense but not the  right of collective-defense, and remains a country that leaves  to fate whatever happens to its allies, the "American boys."    If the choice is limited to these two narrow options, all  U.S. intellectuals will no doubt opt for Japan's becoming an  ordinary country.    A militaristic country is not an ordinary country; it is a  strange country. It is a strange country if it participates in  PKO's but refuses to shed its blood for the operations and  thrusts sacrifices on other countries. Japan should become an  ordinary country and should be prepared for the time when the  proof of the alliance is necessary. This is the only  alternative to saving the Japan-U.S. alliance.    When I gave a lecture in Thailand, I was asked: "For the  Southeast Asian countries, Japan is exactly the right country to  balance with China. Why did Japan advance in the past believing  in militarism and why does it shut itself up now believing in  pacifism? Japan cannot be a helpful country to us under such  circumstances."    I am fully aware that the middle-of-the-road is difficult to  tread. Then the right thing for the Japanese to do is to seek  the middle-of-the-road. The coalition cabinet, including the  Social Democratic Party of Japan, may be a gift from Heaven for  that.</p>

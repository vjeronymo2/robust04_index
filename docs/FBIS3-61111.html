			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article, unsigned: "Divide and Rule: Are You for the </F> President?"]    [Text] In recent past, we used to be asked: "Who is  marching out of line?" Dissent, if it existed at all, was not  welcome and was cut at the root. Thus, we should not blame  universal conformity and unanimity on the lingering collectivist  mentality. There used to be a well-oiled machine to ensure that  the cogs served the system reliably. Remember those endless  party staff meetings, party and economic leadership meetings,  directives circularly and instructional seminars?    Apparently, the Presidential Service misses those  unforgettable days of democratic centralism of the Communist  Party, the time when those who carried out party and government  policy diligently gathered in former Ordzhonikidze Street to  hear the usual pep talk from the head of the department of  propaganda and agitation. How else can you explain the  appearance of this interesting document which fell into the  hands of the NEZAVISIMOST? Here is the slightly abridged text of  a directives circular sent out to local presidential  representatives. We hope that the readers will draw their own  conclusions.    In light of the Ukrainian Supreme Council decision to  hold early Ukrainian Supreme Council and presidential elections  in Ukraine, it has become necessary to analyze the current  disposition of forces among the participants of the political  process in Ukraine and to identify areas of possible cooperation  with them during the election campaign.    The following citizens' organizations are the subject  of study of this letter, drafted by the Presidential Service on  Domestic Policy Issues:    political parties;    trade union organizations;    veterans' organizations; and    religious organizations.    The stated positions are not final and may change under  the influence of circumstances.  <H5>  Political Parties Before the Elections. </H5>   At October 1993, the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice  registered  29 political parties.    Based on territorial division of political influence,  political parties can be generally divided into three groups;    The first group consists of right-wing parties,  the parties of the so-called national, nationalist and  ultra-nationalist orientation, together with their satellite  organizations; their influence extends to the western region  (Ivano-Frankovsk, Ternopol, Lvov, Volyn and Rovno oblasts).    They are the Ukrainian Republican Party (URP), the Ukrainian  Peasants Democratic Party, the Democratic Party of Ukraine, the  Ukrainian Christian-Democratic Party, the Ukrainian National  Conservative Party, the Popular Movement (Rukh) of Ukraine  (V.Chornovol, leader), the civic and political organization  National Movement (Rukh) of Ukraine (L.Skoryk, leader), the  Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine, the Congress of Ukrainian  Nationalists and the Ukraine National Independence.    In addition to the western region, the above-mentioned  associations of citizens have smaller affiliates in central  Ukrainian oblasts, whereas in eastern and northern regions their  political potential barely rises above zero.    The other group is comprised of center and  left-of-center parties whose activity and political influence  cover the central region of Ukraine, as well as some eastern and  northern oblasts.    They are the Green Party of Ukraine, the Party of Democratic  Renewal of Ukraine, the Social Democratic Party of Ukraine, the  Ukrainian Beer Lovers' Party, the Liberal Democratic Party of  Ukraine, the Ukrainian Justice Party, the Ukrainian Solidarity  and Social Justice Party, the Constitutional Democratic Party  and the Labor Congress of Ukraine.    The remaining political parties have a left and  radical left orientation. They include the Socialist Party of  Ukraine, the Peasant Party of Ukraine, the Citizens' Congress of  Ukraine and the Communist Party of Ukraine. They mainly dominate  the eastern and northern regions, or share their influence there  with local parties such as the People's Party of Ukraine  (L.Taburyanskyy, leader), the Liberal Party of Ukraine (Donetsk;  I.Markulov, leader), the Labor Party (Donetsk; A.Azarov,  leader), the Party of Economic Renewal of the Crimea and the  Party of Ukraine National Salvation (Dnepropetrovsk Oblast).    The main characteristic traits of the political  parties' activity today are:    the dominant position and role of party leaders in defining  the political course of each party and in the decision making  process;    the dominant confrontational mentality resulting from the  tough ideological and political struggle which is sustained by  the parties themselves; and    the activity of the the political parties is concentrated  exclusively around power structures and is not directed toward  bolstering their popular support. It is limited to congresses,  conferences, discussions of their own programs to overcome the  crisis and reactions by means of statements and declarations to  various events in the political process.    There are two main forms of party activity in the country:    a. rallies and demonstrations; and    b. opposition to local authorities, demands and attempts to  replace them.    The relative strength of different political parties, their  political behavior, their attitude toward main events of the  political process in Ukraine and their attitude to the political  course of the president provide the basis for  differentiating among political parties from the point of  view of the prospects for their cooperation with the  president. Potentially open to such cooperation are parties  of a moderate center-left orientation (the Green Party of  Ukraine, the Social Democratic Party of Ukraine, the Labor  Congress of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Justice Party and the Labor  Party), as well as center parties (the Liberal Party of Ukraine,  the Ukrainian Beer Lovers' Party, the Constitutional Democratic  Party and the Ukrainian Solidarity and Social Justice Party).  Excluded from this group are the Liberal Democratic Party of  Ukraine and the Party of Democratic Renewal of Ukraine, whose  leaders, having joined forced under V.Chornovol, have recently  displayed a slant against the president.    Great difficulties are presented by the task of finding  common ground with candidates and leaders of left-wing parties,  such as the Communist Party of Ukraine, the Citizens' Congress,  the Union of Ukraine Communists, the Socialist Party and the  Peasant Party. At the same time, it should be noted that the  political initiative of the president on the Economic Union of  the CIS, as well as his position on the Masandra agreements,  were welcomed by them and their affiliated organizations as a  sign of the ability and willingness on the part of the president  to display political will and assume the initiative and  responsibility for resolving very difficult political problems.  This also reduced the likelihood of attacks on the president  from the left. Given the responsible change of political course  by the president, certain goodwill on the part of left-wing  political forces, in particular from the Socialist and Peasant  parties, can be expected during the pre-election period.    The Rukh, the Ukrainian Peasant Democratic Party, the  Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine and Memorial base their  election platforms on opposition to the president; they should  be considered as the core of a possible unified  anti-presidential bloc on the right.    Ultra-radical nationalist groups, the Ukrainian Conservative  Republican Party, the National Independence of Ukraine, the  Ukrainian National Conservative Party and the Congress of  Ukrainian Nationalists are moving toward opposition to the  president.    The election campaign, which has in effect already begun,  will cause changes in the structure of political blocs. It  should be noted that the form and makeup of possible electoral  blocs among parties at the regional level and at local centers  may not always follow accords and agreements at the leadership  level of those political parties.    Existing political parties have real influence on a  relatively small portion of the electorate. For this reason, the  election campaign will be informed by the actions of other  political and economic groups: trade union organizations,  associations of entrepreneurs and producers, economic managers  and managers of the agricultural sector.  <H5>  Trade Union Organizations </H5>   Thirteen national trade union organizations exist in  Ukraine.  The largest of them is the Federation of Trade Unions of Ukraine  (FPU), headed by O.M.Stoyan; it is comprised of 40 all-Ukrainian  industry trade unions and 26 organizations from oblasts, the  Crimean Republic, and the city of Kiev, as well as  inter-industry (regional) associations.    Considering that the FPU has some 20 million members and  possesses an extensive organizational network and considerable  material and financial resources, it can be predicted that that  trade union organization will have a considerable impact on the  electoral campaign. Overall, the position of the FPU on the  current government and political issues is moderate.    Unlike some other trade union associations and strike  committees, the FPU in its activities does not go outside the  law. Under pressure from grass-root organizations who want the  FPU leadership to act more decisively in providing social  protection to workers, the position of the FPU has become more  radical in recent months. The second FPU congress, which took  place at the end of August 1993. severely criticized the Supreme  Council, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and the president  for the policy of "robbery of the population." A resolution was  approved demanding an early dissolution of the Supreme Council  and a referendum (in September 1993) on the socio-economic and  political structure of the state, on the form of state  government and on the confidence (or no confidence) for the  president of Ukraine.    The FPU welcomed the decision of the Supreme Council to hold  early Supreme Council and presidential elections and considered  them "to some degree satisfactory."    In the new Supreme Council, the FPU intends to create its  own  trade union faction.    The FPU pursues the policy of constructive cooperation with  the structures of presidential authority both in the central  government and locally.    However, leaders of some trade unions in the FPU have a  determined, non-constructive attitude toward the president.    This primarily refers to trade union leaders in Odessa and  Kharkov oblasts, the trade union leadership in the coal industry  and some others.    The leaders of those trade union organizations are opposed  to  the current policy of the FPU and its leadership.    The FPU maintains contacts with political parties of  different orientations, but as of now it has not yet concluded  any agreements of cooperation in the election campaign with any  of them.    It can be predicted that an active part in the election  campaign will be played by the All-Ukrainian Association of  Labor Solidarity (VOST), which has often supported political  forces of the right. There are signs that that association,  together with the Independent Trade Union of Ukraine Miners  (NPG) and some other small trade unions, may join the coalition  of political forces behind V.M.Chornovol and his supporters.    However, the latter trade unions have small membership and  lack a broadly based organizational network, so that their  influence in the regions in insignificant.    Leaders of the strike committees in the Donbass maintain  their opposition to the president. At the same time, strike  committee leaders have criticized the position of O.R.Mril, the  head of the NPG, for his intent to ally himself with  V.M.Chornovol. In the election campaign, the strike committees  may support such political parties as the Liberals and Labor.  Strike committee leaders intend to run for the Supreme Council  themselves.    The position of the strike committees, due to their  influence  in the miners' collectives in Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts, will  probably be reflected in the results of the elections in the  Donbass.    The analysis of the situation in Ukraine trade union circles  ahead of the election campaign suggests that the position of the  trade union organizations will largely determine the results of  both the Supreme Council and presidential elections. A strategy  for the pre-election period should be developed with this in  mind.  <H5>  Veterans' Organizations </H5>   Despite the lack of organizational unity among veterans'  organizations in Ukraine, all those different groups and  associations of veterans have absolutely identical political  sympathies, with the exception of those who rally around the  radical interpretation of the national idea. This similarity in  evaluating socio-political processes in Ukraine reflects several  factors; principal among them are common life history, tied to  the building of "socialism" in the USSR and extreme financial  difficulties experienced by older people.    However, when discussing the pre-election mood of older  people, we should not overestimate their conscious  adherence to various political forces. A highly defined  political orientation is typical mainly to those veterans who  are actively cooperating with the nationalist forces or who had  been actively involved in the implementation of the "communist"  idea. As a whole, the masses of veterans are open to a widest  variety of political influences.  <H5>  Religious Organizations </H5>   The post-totalitarian period of development in Ukraine has  been characterized by an extremely high level of politicization  of the church. The existence of conflict situations between some  religious organizations is being used by a variety of political  forces and their leaders to further their own ends, which in  effect informs the participation of the church in the election  campaign.    In particular, the Congress of National Democratic Forces  counts on the strong support from the Ukrainian Orthodox Church,  Kiev Patriarchate; plus the Congress continues to rely on the  Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in Galicia, although with less  certainty. Thus, attempts by some Congress leaders to establish  the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, Kiev Patriarchate, as the  national church, in fact a state church, make it doubtful that  believers belonging to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church would  continue to support that political movement.    The Ukrainian Orthodox Church, Kiev Patriarchate; the  Ukrainian Autocephalian Orthodox Church and the Ukrainian Greek  Catholic Church are the most politicized among religious  organizations and they generally adhere to the ideas of radical  nationalism. However, those religious organizations have only  regional influence and make up only one third of all religious  organizations, and even less than that in terms of the number of  adherents.    The least politicized are such churches as the Ukrainian  Orthodox Church (the largest in Ukraine in number of parishes  and followers), the Protestant Church and the Roman Catholic  Church. Religious organizations of ethnic minorities will most  likely look to the left and center-left forces, which do not  share the idea of establishing a single national church.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["France Accused of Aggravating Situation on Korean </F> Peninsula"]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 19 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic  People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Saturday [18 June] accused  France of aggravating the situation on the Korean peninsula by  supporting sanctions against the DPRK, the local newspaper  NODONG SINMUN reported today.    It was reported that the French Foreign Ministry recently  favored a decisive measure against the DPRK and manifested its  official stand to support a UN resolution on sanctions.    "Such moves of France are aimed at preventing the 'nuclear  issue' which has become an international focal point from being  solved through DPRK-U.S. talks... goading Northeast Asian  countries onto a conflict and thereby fishing in troubled  waters," the paper quoted a spokesman of the DPRK Foreign  Ministry as saying.    "The situation in our country now has become extremely  tense," he said, adding that "our people are making full  prepartions to defend the dignity and sovereignty of the  country."    "We have already declared more than once that in case any  'sanctions' should be imposed on us, not only the parties taking  the van in enforcing them but also those who back them would be  held responsible," the spokesman noted.    "The French authorities must know that our warning is not an  empty word," he warned.    The spokesman pointed out that as a permanent member of the  UN Security Council, France "should help toward a peaceful  solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through  dialogue and negotiation."</p>

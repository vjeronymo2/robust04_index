			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Views" column: "Disastrous Mistake"] </F>   [Text] It would be a disastrous mistake by the  international community to decide to dispatch Turkish troops as  Blue Helmets [UN forces] to Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Enough mistakes have been committed thus far, the primary  mistake being the breakup of Yugoslavia. Europeans played a  pioneering role in this breakup, which opened the road to  bloodshed and the current deadlocks.    It would be a disastrous mistake, because in no case should  any other Balkan country become involved in the Balkan crisis  and, moreover, a country which had a historic involvement and  expansionist designs.    It is obvious that Turkey does not seek a peacemaking role  in  the Yugoslav crisis. It seeks to be present and exert influence  in the former provinces that were enslaved by the Ottoman Empire.    Therefore, it would be a provocation for all the Balkan  peoples if their former oppressor returned allegedly as  peacemaker.    Turkey is seeking a role in the Balkans and without any  loss,  as is always the case. It seeks this role at a time when the  Turkish economy is threatened with a collapse since all its  exchange reserves have been exhausted. In addition, Turkey is  also facing a lot of internal problems with open fronts in the  Kurdish areas.    The United Nations and, above all, the European Union cannot  ignore the elements of the Yugoslav crisis and throw oil on the  Bosnian fire when the danger of a more general conflagration is  obvious.    It is precisely because of this danger that there is an  unwillingness by many countries to send the Blue Helmets to  Bosnia-Herzegovina. In spite of this, there is an offer  sufficient to cover the needs by countries that have no  connection with the Balkans.    Greece ought to persist firmly on its stance and prevent by  all means the dispatch of Turkish or other troops from any  Balkan country.    Lack of forethought by the international community could  turn  back the clock of history and cause a conflagration with  unpredictable consequences.    So, they must study history and the peculiarity of the  Balkan  region before making any offhand decision. They have done  enough that is not to their credit regarding the bloodshed and  deadlocks in the former Yugoslavia.</p>

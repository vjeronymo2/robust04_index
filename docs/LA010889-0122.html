			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS;  </P> <P> JONES SHOOTS 72 BUT UPS LEAD TO 2 AT LA COSTA  </P> <P> Weather has become a factor in the 37th MONY Tournament of Champions at La  Costa.  </P> <P> It was windy, cold and damp on Friday and it was just plain nasty Saturday,  when a mid-afternoon rain made playing conditions difficult for the leaders.  </P> <P> Still, there were no real surprises on the leader board, although Steve Jones  said he was surprised that he was still leading.  </P> <P> Jones started the day 6 under par, with a 1-stroke lead over Chip Beck. He was  still 6 under par at the finish.  </P> <P> For a while, though, Jones fell 3 strokes behind Beck, his playing partner.  However, Jones birdied the 14th, 15th and 16th holes, bogeyed the 17th and came  in at 72.  </P> <P> Beck faltered with a 40 on the back 9 for a 74 and a 54-hole total of 213, the  same as Sandy Lyle. Jones, at 210, has a 2-stroke lead over Ben Crenshaw and  Lanny Wadkins.  </P> <P> Also in contention going into the final round today are Bob Lohr, David Frost,  Jay Haas and Jeff Sluman at 214; Bill Glasson and Greg Norman at 215, and  Curtis Strange, Tom Sieckmann and Mark Calcavecchia at 216.  </P> <P> So there are 13 pros within 6 shots of the lead.  </P> <P> "I'm surprised that no one has made a move up to now," Jones said. "Tomorrow,  someone will probably make a move, and I hope it's me."  </P> <P> Jones, a first-time qualifier for this tournament, has held up under the  pressure, even though he has only one career victory on the tour, the AT&amp;T  Pebble Beach Pro-Am last year.  </P> <P> He made a comeback on the back side after his driver betrayed him.  </P> <P> "The driver is no longer in my bag," said Jones, who changed drivers Saturday  and used the club only 5 times.  </P> <P> He has 3 drivers with him and has already used 2 without any appreciable  results.  </P> <P> "I've hit it straight, I've hit it to the left and I've hit it to the right,"  Jones said of his errant drives. "I just didn't know where it's going."  </P> <P> Jones said that driving is usually the strongest part of his game, so he's  compensating with solid iron play and chipping.  </P> <P> For example, he chipped into the hole from about 40 feet for his birdie on No.  16.  </P> <P> "Overall, I'm happy. I'm getting a lot out of my game," he said.  </P> <P> Crenshaw and Wadkins, both veterans, are in a favorable position. Crenshaw shot  a 2-under-par 70 Saturday after taking a triple-bogey 8 on the par-5 17th hole  Friday and winding up with a 72. Wadkins has been steady with rounds of 71, 70  and 71.  </P> <P> Glasson had the best round of the day, coming in at 67, and finishing just  before it began to rain.  </P> <P> He was 5 under par for the last 5 holes. He birdied No. 14 and 15 and then got  an eagle on the par-4, 423-yard 16th with a driver and a 4-iron that took one  bounce on the green and went into the cup.  </P> <P> Glasson had a par on No. 17, missing a 6-foot putt for a birdie, and then sank  a 20-foot birdie putt on No. 18.  </P> <P> However, he said it was an unusual par on No. 13, after 2 successive bogeys,  that got him going. His drive landed against a tree. So, on his second shot, he  turned his 8-iron over and hit it left-handed 100 yards down the fairway. Then  he hit a wedge to the green and made the par-saving putt.  </P> <P> It's not inconceivable that Strange could be challenging for the lead. He has  made startling charges in previous years.  </P> <P> Strange, the PGA player of the year and the leading money-winner in 1988, had a  77 Thursday when he 4-putted on the first hole. Then he shot a 70 and a 69 and  is just 6 strokes behind Jones.  </P> <P> Crenshaw said that mud was a problem Saturday on second and approach shots,  making a swing an unexpected adventure.  </P> <P> Mud was his undoing Friday when he put successive shots in a lake bordering the  17th fairway.  </P> <P> "As the joke goes, it was a good 8," Crenshaw said of his triple bogey.  </P> <P> Wadkins said he thought he was dressed too warmly at the outset of his round,  when the sun was shining. But he appreciated that comfort on the last 3 holes  when rain drenched the leaders.  </P> <P> "It was just cold, windy and damp, and the ball picks up a lot of mud," he  said. "Patience is the big thing this week."  </P> <P> Wadkins, who won the Tournament of Champions in 1982 and 1983, was fairly  satisfied with his round of 71, which included 3 birdies and 2 bogeys.  </P> <P> "I didn't think I played that great, but I hung in there," Wadkins said.  </P> <P> That seems to be the key word for this tournament, with the weather being so  capricious.  </P> <P> Andrew Magee, the first-day leader at 68, hasn't been able to hang in there. He  has had successive rounds of 75 and 79.  </P></p>

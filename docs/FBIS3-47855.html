			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Beijing-based correspondent Pak Song-chun] </F>   [Text] According to a reliable Beijing source, North Korea  has decided to declare to its people and to the world that it  would conclude the nuclear issue before March or April and  announce a PRC-style opening policy. Hwang Chang-yop, chairman  of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the North Korean Supreme  People's Assembly, unofficially arrived in Beijing on 15 January  for an eight-day visit to discuss this, the source said.    Hwang, who was appointed chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly--a position which  actually controls the North Korean nuclear issue and foreign  affairs--in December 1993 among high-ranking North Korean  officials, will also discuss President Kim Il-song's visit to  the PRC with the PRC side, according to the source.    It is known that through Kim Il-song's visit to the PRC,  which is expected to immediately follow Hwang's PRC visit, Kim  Il-song will make a final discussion with high-ranking PRC  officials on North Korea's PRC-style opening policy which has  already been decided by himself.    The PRC-style opening policy decided by North Korea will be  the special economic zone-style adopted by the PRC. North Korea  has decided to make Najin and Sonbong region the first special  economic zone and already concluded legislative procedures for  the opening of the region in relation to the development of the  lower Tumen river.    In relation to the opening-up policy decided by North Korea,  Hwang, who began his unofficial visit to the PRC from 15  January, is scheduled to visit Guangzhou and Shenzhen which are  special economic zones in southern PRC.    The Beijing source also said that the ROK Government is  known  to be aware of the trend of North Korea's policy and is  considering to open a liaison office in Najin or Sonbong through  the UN Development Program after North Korea announces its  opening up.    The source said that in a meeting attended by Kim Il-song,  North Korean authorities already made such a decision to declare  a PRC-style opening up policy as a result of an internal  discussion on the choice of policy direction after the  resolution of the nuclear issue, and that North Korean  high-ranking authorities already began drawing up plans to  implement the opening-up policy for the era after the resolution  of the nuclear issue.</p>

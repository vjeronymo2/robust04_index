			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By diplomatic correspondent Boris Krivoshey] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 15 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- The peacekeeping  operation in Abkhazia can begin only after a positive decision  to that effect is made by the Federation Council of the Russian  Federal Assembly. This view was expressed at a briefing today by  Mikhail Demurin, deputy head of the press and information  department of the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry.    He said that a reconnaissance group of generals and officers  from the Russian Defense Ministry has been in Abkhazia since 14  June with the aim of organizing the deployment of a Russian  contingent which would be part of the joint peacekeeping forces  in the Abkhaz- Georgian conflict zone.    "Analysis of the situation has shown that any further delays  in the deployment of peacekeeping forces may lead to  unpredictable consequences," Mikhail Demurin said.</p>

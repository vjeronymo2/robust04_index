			<p>DEA   <F P=102>   PY1904231194 Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS in Spanish 9 Apr 94 p 1 </F> <F P=103> PY1904231194 </F> <F P=104>  Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] La Paz -- The Bolivian Armed Forces commander,  General Fernando Sanjines Yanez, energetically condemned reports  on the virtual "submission" of the Bolivian institutional system  to the DEA and the violation, according to several reports, of  national sovereignty.    Shortly after the end of a ceremony to celebrate the Army  Engineering Command's 33d anniversary, Gen. Sanjines Yanez  categorically stated: "It is our duty to see that the Bolivian  institutions or foreign organizations established in our country  respect our Constitution and demand that they all, with no  exceptions, respect the country's physical integrity and  national sovereignty."    Sanjines added: "The Armed Forces will never tolerate the  violation of our country's integrity or sovereignty; this cannot  be and less still will the Armed Forces allow it."    The Armed Forces' commander made this statement shortly  after  the DEA created a big scandal in Bolivia and Costa Rica due to  its anti-drug operation procedures involving Edgar Fernandez  Lazcano, right-hand man of alleged drug trafficker Isaac  Chavarria, aka Oso, who is regarded as the key witness to  clarify charges that the Movement of the Revolutionary Left has  "links to drug traffickers."    So far, Government Ministry authorities have not come up  with  an explanation on the flight or abduction of Fernandez, in which  the DEA appears directly involved together with Bolivian  security forces and, particularly, the Special Antinarcotics  Force [FELCN].    Government Minister German Quiroga and Foreign Minister  Antonio Aranibar Quiroga both asserted that the DEA did not  abduct Fernandez, that he "escaped" on his own. Information  from abroad, especially Costa Rica, however, state the opposite.  That is, that Fernandez arrived in and left Costa Rica  accompanied by DEA agents.    This complex situation prompted opposition legislators in  the  last few hours to summon the government minister to Congress to  give an official and detailed report on the developments in  order to definitely determine the DEA's participation in the  investigations into "narcolinks" that, without much evidence,  FELCN reported involved top-ranking MIR leaders.    In the meantime, several institutions, such as the Armed  Forces and others, condemned the charges of DEA intervention and  demanded that President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada call for  "greater respect for Bolivian dignity" in view of "U.S.  interventionism."</p>

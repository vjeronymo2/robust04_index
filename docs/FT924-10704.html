			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / TUC to organise series of rallies THE Trades Union Congress yesterday said that it will organise a series of rallies in the five regions which contain the 10 pits left on British Coal's closure list, Jimmy Burns writes. The rallies will aim to draw on the broadest possible coalition of political and church groups. The next stage of the TUC's campaign, aimed at keeping up the pressure on the government and garnering public support on the coal issue, will culminate in a lobby of parliament in January to coincide with the end of the review. Meanwhile Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has agreed to meet TUC officials on Tuesday to discuss ideas for promoting economic growth. Agreement to the meeting comes five months after the government announced it was winding up the tripartite National Economic Council. A High Court hearing of an injuction application by the National Union of Mineworkers against British Coal has been postponed until Tuesday.</p>

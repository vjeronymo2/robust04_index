			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Russia to resettle miners Fifty thousand Russian coalminers and their families will be resettled by the government as their mines in northern Siberia are closed, senior coal industry officials said yesterday. The miners live in settlements where the pits are the only source of employment, and have little possibility of finding alternative employment if the government resists pressure to bail out failing state enterprises with inflationary soft loans. Mr Yuri Malyshev, head the state coal producers' association, said 50,000 miners and their families from the settlement of Vorkuta and the northern region as a whole would be resettled over the next few years. However, so far only 500 families have been resettled in more hospitable southern areas. Russian coal production was down 12 per cent in the first half of this year compared with last year. Two thousand Russian farmers, members of the Agrarian party, and communists demonstrated yesterday against President Boris Yeltsin and his government, saying ill-conceived reforms were wrecking agriculture and rural life.</p>

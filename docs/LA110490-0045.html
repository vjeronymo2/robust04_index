			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: NONFICTION  </P> <P> CELEBRATING FIFTY By Karen Blaker (Contemporary Books: $17.95; 192 pp.). This  collection of conversations with women who hover near 50 reads, sadly, like the  tepid outtakes of Barbara Raskin's novel, "Hot Flashes."  </P> <P> Karen Blaker's subjects suffer from an unfortunate homogeneity both of  circumstance and attitude. Most are moms of almost-grown children, or  grandmoms; hasn't Blaker noticed that there's about to be a generation of  50-year-old women whose kids are still in elementary school? Most are  economically comfortable, educated, naturally reflective women -- just the ones  for whom turning 50 is likely to be easiest. The book suggests that a woman of  50 needs to be her own best advocate, refusing to accept the received wisdom  about what can, and should, be an energetic period in her life. But Blaker does  little to empower the reader. Her subjects are too glib, her questions too  bland. It's hard not to get angry, reading this effort. Blaker's intended  audience deserves more than tea and sympathy.  </P></p>

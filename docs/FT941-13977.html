			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Decision soon on Independent future The future of Newspaper Publishing, the publisher of the Independent and Independent on Sunday, may be decided next week. A board meeting scheduled for Thursday is becoming an effective deadline for the submission of formal bids and offers. There is a growing realisation that further delay could damage both the credibility and future of the newspaper group which is believed to be currently losing about Pounds 1.5m a year. At the same time, considerable efforts are being made to calm staff fears about the editorial implications of Mirror Group Newspapers taking a substantial minority stake in the group. The plan being negotiated by a consortium led by the paper's principal founder, Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, envisages MGN taking a 40 per cent stake. The continental investors, El Pais and La Repubblica, would increase their stake to 51 per cent with the founders holding the remaining block. The deal would consolidate the position of Mr Whittam Smith who would remain editor-in-chief. To remove fears of editorial interference it is believed that MGN has agreed that it will not vote on either the removal or appointment of editors. The proposed board structure would also give MGN only two directors out of seven. El Pais would have two directors as would La Repubblica. The final directorship would go to a founder of the company, almost certainly Mr Whittam Smith. If a deal is finally agreed with MGN, a proposal will go forward to Thursday's board meeting. Mr Ian Hay Davison, Newspaper Publishing chairman, has made it clear he hopes to be able to put an alternative offer on the table for the future funding of the paper. Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers group is expected to confirm a bid for up to 29.9 per cent of the company. The Irish group, which has only tiny newspaper interests in the UK, would probably have less problem getting early agreement from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission than MGN, which already owns three national newspapers in the UK. Mr Vincent Browne, editor and a minority shareholder of Dublin's Sunday Tribune newspaper, in which Independent Newspapers has a 29.9 per cent stake, has been ousted following a board meeting on Thursday, writes Tim Coone. No reason was given for his dismissal, which is bad publicity for Mr O'Reilly, but the paper has been suffering from declining circulation and mounting losses.</p>

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Fall in US new home sales figures SALES of new homes fell slightly in the US last month, but the drop did not appear to cloud prospects for an economic recovery significantly. The Commerce Department said it had recorded new home sales at an adjusted annual rate of 613,000 in February, down 2.7 per cent from January's figure of 630,000. But the decline only took the edge off an 11.1 per cent rise in sales in January. Sales of existing homes have shown signs of revival: the National Association of Realtors reports a 9.3 per cent rise in February. The department reported that the stock of new houses for sale fell 4 per cent in February to 269,000, its lowest level since 1983. This stock represented only 5.2 months of sales, it said. Median sale prices, however, dropped in February to Dollars 117,000 (Pounds 67,630) from Dollars 123,000 in January, lower than a year earlier. The recession-hit north-east showed the most vitality, with new home sales rebounding 14 per cent in February after seasonal adjustments to a level 40 per cent up on a year ago.</p>

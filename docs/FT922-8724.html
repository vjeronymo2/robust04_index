			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Resolution of Maxwell insurance claim nears PROTRACTED negotiations over unresolved insurance claims connected to the mysterious death of Mr Robert Maxwell last November appear to be reaching a final phase. It emerged yesterday that Mr Roger Rich of loss-adjusters Rich Wheeler &amp; Company, who is acting on behalf of the insurers, had travelled abroad to complete his final investigations into Mr Maxwell's death. It is thought that Mr Rich may be in Villefranche-sur-Mer, on the Cote D'Azur, where the Lady Ghislaine, Mr Maxwell's boat from which he fell overboard on November 5, is for sale. A group of insurers, including Lloyd's syndicates and London market companies, stand to pay Pounds 20m if it can be shown that Mr Maxwell died from accidental causes. Mr John Fisher, claims manager for Lloyd's syndicate 782, which led the policy, said that the insurers had met last week with Hextall Erskine, the solicitors, and that the matter was now in their hands. Six months of negotiations involving the insurers, the Maxwell group of companies, and Arthur Andersen, the Maxwell administrators, have failed to lead to an agreement, with neither side providing conclusive proof as to the cause of death, In February, Lloyd's made an initial announcement saying that they were not prepared to pay up the policy as, in their view, there was no liability. An earlier report by Rich Wheeler concluded that the evidence suggesting Mr Maxwell took his own life was 'more compelling than any other cause'. Since Mr Maxwell's death the Lady Ghislaine has been moved from Gibraltar to Mallorca and on to Antibes in a continuing attempt to find a buyer. It is understood that Camper &amp; Nicholson, the agents, have reduced the initial asking price of Dollars 24m (Pounds 13.5m) for the 55m yacht.</p>

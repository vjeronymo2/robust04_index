			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (24): Discount became a loss - Hindsight / Even a small-print reader may trip over the rules and they are not all set by sharks or fraudsters. Even innocent transactions can take great bites out of your investments, if you are not careful. Hard-won investment gains have a habit of seeping away through management, dealing and other charges. Attention to detail and a willingness to read the small print helps. But even that is not proof against unexpected loss. Mr Ron Boyce, a part-retired civil engineer from Hayling Island, is a small-print reader. He is well-informed and has a healthy degree of scepticism when it comes to trusting other people with his money. Yet Mr Boyce and his wife, Sheila, still managed to see a large chunk wiped off part of their investment portfolio during what should have been a routine investment operation. Mrs Boyce had held unit trusts managed by Prolific for four years when she and her husband decided to switch the investment into a personal equity plan (Pep) in February. Yet the deal ended up wiping 8.7 per cent cent off the value of their investment, even after a special discount from Prolific. The Boyces did not make any serious errors, and Prolific did not rip them off. They were just the victims of what can often be costly inefficiencies in the investment markets. At the root of the problem is the fact that it is not possible to transfer existing investments into Peps - they have to be sold and bought back. Also, under Financial Services Act rules, there has to be a seven-day 'cooling off' period after a Pep application is received, to give potential investors a chance to change their minds. Taken together, these rules caught out the Boyces. Their application was received by Prolific towards the end of February, and their units (in the company's High Income and Extra Income unit trusts) were sold on 21st. The money was then held for seven days, before being used to repurchase units within the Pep. During that time, the Boyces were out of the stock market - an unfortunate week to be in that position, as the market surged. According to figures supplied by Prolific, this led to a 4.3 per cent rise in the unit price of the High Income fund and 3.6 per cent for the Extra Income. Buying the units back was therefore a lot more expensive. A close reading of the small print in Prolific's Pep brochure does not make this market risk altogether clear. It explains the seven-day rule. It does not explain, though, that existing units will be sold immediately by the company, rather than at the end of the cooling-off period, giving rise to the market risk. Prolific has since told the Boyces that the seven-day rule is no longer required, and that it is reconsidering its policy in this area. Also, it says it sees nothing wrong with its literature and no reason to change it. That accounts for part of the Boyces' 'loss'. The rest resulted from an aspect of unit-trust pricing that, again, even the most careful reader of the small print might not expect. The Boyces expected to sell units at Prolific's bid price, and buy them back at the offer price. The loss that resulted from paying the spread between bid and offer prices would largely be recouped by a 4 per cent discount offered by Prolific (3 per cent available to all clients who switch, and 1 per cent for taking out a Pep). Prolific's Pep brochure gives illustrative figures for what the spread is likely to be. At the start of this year it was 6 per cent (generally in line with other unit trusts). The spread could get wider, though: there is a maximum permitted spread of 8.2 per cent for the High Income unit trust, and 7.9 per cent for the Extra Income fund. The Boyces ended up suffering virtually the biggest spreads permissible  - 8.1 per cent and 7.8 per cent respectively. Why was the spread so big? Because, explained Prolific, of a change in the basis of pricing the units during the week between the sale and repurchase. There are two different ways of pricing units. The choice of method depends on whether a unit-trust manager is selling more units to investors than he is buying back (in which case he is creating new units), or buying back more units than he is selling (in which case he is cancelling surplus units). In the first case, a 'creation price' is calculated, to reflect the costs of creating new units. This is the price at which they are offered to investors. In such cases, a unit trust is said to be priced on an offer basis, and the price moves towards the top end of its permitted range. When the manager is a net buyer of units, on the other hand, it calculates a 'cancellation' price, to cover the cost of selling the underlying shares. In such cases, the unit trust is priced on a bid basis, and the price moves to the lower end of its range. So the pricing can change a lot, depending on the manager's situation at any particular time. The Boyces fell foul of this process. Between the time their units were sold and repurchased, Prolific switched from pricing its units on a bid basis to pricing them on an offer basis. That meant that the Boyces sold at the low cancellation price, but had to buy back at the high creation price. In all, these factors left the Boyces with 1,671 units in the High Income trust (compared with the 1,793 they started with) and 1,126 in the Extra Income trust (compared with 1,232). That equates to a capital loss of Pounds 247.96 (the pre-loss value of their investment had been Pounds 2,853). It takes time and and care to build up investments. Such losses can take a long time to recoup. Given the current rates of income on the Prolific unit trusts, the switch to the Pep will save Mrs Boyce Pounds 28.63 a year in tax. That means it will be nearly nine years before the tax savings from the Pep more than make up for the cost of switching in the first place. 'We should have known better,' says a rueful Mr Boyce. He had always been distrustful of Peps, aware of the high management charge that can wipe out any tax advantages. But the discount offered by Prolific helped to persuade him and his wife that the switch was worth the effort. If careful and well-informed investors can lose a substantial amount from what should be such a simple transaction, what hope is there for others?</p>

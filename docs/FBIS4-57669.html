			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Morning Information Review" newscast] </F>   [Text] On this Sunday morning, the total UN trade embargo  against Haiti sponsored by the United States went into effect.  This is an attempt to pressure the Haitian military coupists  into giving up power.    The sanctions include intensifying the embargo on crude oil  and military products and equipment, in addition to an  interdiction on all financial and commercial transactions with  the Haitian military regime.    According to some observers, the embargo, to which the UN  Security Council agreed on 6 May, could have disastrous  consequences not only for the country's economy but also for the  Haitian people.    Politicians and journalists in several countries continue to  ponder how much longer the United States will be able to wait  before it resorts to any pretext in order to justify a military  invasion. Meanwhile, U.S. President William Clinton has signed  an order barring all U.S. corporations from any type of  commercial transactions with Haiti.</p>

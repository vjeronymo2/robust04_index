			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu by </F> unidentified reporter, "upon his arrival in Buenos Aires  accompanied by Uruguayan Finance Minister Ignacio de Posadas for  a Mercosur, Common Market of the South, meeting;" date not given]    [Text] [LA PRENSA] Minister Abreu, what are your  expectations for this Mercosur meeting?    [Abreu] The objective of this meeting is to evaluate matters  of importance for the integration of the four Mercosur  countries. One of the more significant matters is the progress  of the technical studies on the common external tariff. Another  very important topic is a Brazilian proposal to create a  free-trade zone in South America. We will evaluate those  topics. Even though this meeting is not being held to meet any  formally established deadline, we can also evaluate the progress  made in all the integration processes.    [LA PRENSA] What points are creating most disagreement among  Mercosur members?    [Abreu] The Treaty of Asuncion divides the integration  process into three major parts: The commercial liberalization  program, which is being implemented in close compliance with the  agreed terms and deadlines; the common external tariff is also  on schedule, although a technical definition is still pending --  one of the reasons for this meeting is to evaluate studies on  this last point. A third controversial point refers to  macroeconomic policies and the consolidation of the integration  process with liberalization in four areas: goods, services,  capital, and labor. This last point is held up by the  asymmetries of the four countries. It will undoubtedly be  evaluated to see what adjustments and political decisions can be  introduced to fulfill the terms of the treaty.    [LA PRENSA] Among the four countries there are problems like  the harmonization of the macroeconomic policies and the common  external tariff. Do you think it will be possible to agree on a  common external tariff by June?    [Abreu] There are disagreements but it should also be noted  that we have complied with the commercial liberalization  deadlines. This is a really important matter because 82 percent  of tariff reductions have already been accomplished and the  number of exceptions has dropped, as was expected. External  tariff levels are now being studied, as I was telling you, and  it should be noted that a consensus has already been reached on  85 percent of the cases to which the common tariff applies.  There are pending decisions on fields that can be considered  sensitive, in petrochemicals, informatics, and capital goods.  We believe by June we will have a technical and political  decision on the work and on the fulfillment of deadlines on this  particular point.    [LA PRENSA] What will be the Uruguayan position with respect  to Mexico?    [Abreu] Uruguay will adopt a very clear position. We want an  additional regulation for Article 44 of the LAIA [Latin American  Integration Association] -- which regulates LAIA's concessions  on agreements reached with third parties -- not just in the case  of Mexico but for all those countries that want to establish  relations with nations outside LAIA. We want to be sufficiently  realistic, from a political viewpoint, in order to acknowledge  this situation. From the legal viewpoint we propose providing an  appropriate framework for integration under an umbrella that  also includes LAIA.    [LA PRENSA] Does Uruguay want to relieve Mexico from the  commitments it assumed with LAIA?    [Abreu] This does not apply just to Mexico. It is an  additional regulation for countries that grant concessions to  third countries outside LAIA and which engage in negotiations  with their partners to compensate for the commercial distortions  that may result from agreements signed in the region. It is an  additional juridical document that will, or may, apply to those  countries which, like Mexico, make deals with countries outside  the region.</p>

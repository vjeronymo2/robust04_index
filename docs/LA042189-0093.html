			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> B OF A'S 1ST-QUARTER PROFIT SETS RECORD AT $275 MILLION  </P> <P> BankAmerica's remarkable recovery gathered momentum in the first quarter of  this year, with profits rising to a record $275 million and solid progress  reported in key areas.  </P> <P> The parent of Bank of America said Thursday that its first-quarter profits were  152% higher than in the same period of 1988 and $10 million higher than in the  last quarter of that year.  </P> <P> Although one-time gains helped boost the bottom line, real improvements were  posted in net interest income, domestic loan quality and expenses.  </P> <P> As a reward for their role in the turnaround at the nation's third-largest  banking company, B of A provided about 50,000 employees with 10 shares of stock  each during the quarter at a total cost of $19 million.  </P> <P> "Line by line, it performed better than I expected and, by the time you get to  the bottom line, it was quite a bit better overall," said Donald K. Crowley, a  bank analyst in the San Francisco office of the Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods  investment firm.  </P> <P> Plagued by loan losses and operating problems, BankAmerica was deep in the red  for three consecutive years, culminating in a $955-million loss in 1987. But  last year the company rebounded with profits of $726 million.  </P> <P> The first quarter indicates that the pace of the progress is picking up at the  San Francisco banking company. And Frank N. Newman, the chief financial  officer, said he sees no reason for the fundamental progress to slow in the  coming months.  </P> <P> The most impressive aspect of Thursday's report was the sheer size of the  profits. The $275 million was higher than in any quarter in bank history, even  during the salad years of the 1970s when Bank of America was the world's  biggest bank.  </P> <P> The chief component of the increase was a 26% hike in net interest income,  which rose to $987 million from $779 million in the first quarter of 1988.  </P> <P> Interest income got a boost from $46 million in interest from Brazil, which  counted as a one-time item because the Brazilian loans are still listed as  non-performing. But even without that interest, the income was up $162 million  over last year.  </P> <P> Tax credits associated with previous losses added another $67 million to  profits in the quarter.  </P> <P> Another sign of progress, analyst Crowley said, was a strong increase in fees  from service charges on deposit accounts, such as the new fees for automated  teller transactions. The increase helped boost noninterest income to $436  million from $424 million a year ago.  </P> <P> While the increase was small, it reversed several quarters of flat or declining  noninterest income that had resulted from the bank's sale of revenue-producing  assets to cope with its losses.  </P> <P> On the credit quality side, net loan losses dropped to $27 million from $30  million, reflecting $127 million in loan losses and $100 million in recoveries  from loans previously written off as lost. The figure has been low for several  quarters because the bank has been recovering substantial amounts from loans  previously written off, and Newman acknowledged that recoveries are likely to  decline in future quarters.  </P> <P> Analyst Stephen Berman of County NatWest Securities in New York said his  calculations showed that BankAmerica's domestic problem loans dropped $200  million in the quarter, the best among the nation's biggest banks. In contrast,  he said, Citicorp in New York added $400 million in real estate construction  loans to its list of non-performing loans in the quarter.  </P> <P> Noninterest expense, which covers such items as staff and equipment, was $949  million, up $16 million from the first quarter of last year. Without two  one-time costs, expenses would have declined $38 million, largely through the  elimination of 4,400 jobs in the last 12 months.  </P> <P> One of the special items was the $19 million for stock awards to employees. The  other was an additional set-aside of $35 million to cover potential losses from  the bank's role in problems related to $1.4 billion in student loans.  </P> <P> Nine of the world's largest banks sued B of A this week, charging that it is  responsible for losses as high as $650 million because federal guarantees on  the student loans were voided by mismanagement.  </P> <P> B of A set aside $80 million to $90 million for the problem in the fourth  quarter of 1988. The bank actually set aside more than $35 million in the first  quarter of this year, but declined to disclose the total sum, which included  recoveries from other lawsuits. Analysts estimated that the bank has provided  close to $150 million so far to deal with the problem.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vitaliy Portnikov report in the "Ukraine" column: "Will </F> Aleksandr Moroz Become a `Ukrainian Rybkin'? Victory by the  Socialist Leader Has Been Forecast"]    [Text] Observers in Kiev increasingly tend to compare  Aleksandr Moroz, newly elected Supreme Soviet chairman, to  Russian State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin: evolution, they imply,  is inevitable, and the political transformation that has  occurred with the State Duma chairman will also happen to the  Ukraine parliament speaker. Especially since their political  backgrounds are so similar: neither Moroz nor Rybkin succeeded  in the upper echelons of the old party nomenklatura, and both  became leaders of left forces when their former leaders, who had  top-level approval, grew disillusioned with these forces. The  Moroz case is especially indicative: he entered big-time  politics when it began to seem to party leaders that a  "grassroots" deputy was needed to play the role of a party  faction organizer while the real orchestrators were to stay in  the shadows, but after the Ukraine Communist Party was banned,  the former majority leader not only did not sit in the shadows  but launched vigorous efforts to rescue the left forces which at  the time appeared marginal: this was how the Ukraine Socialist  Party emerged which appeared to be communist until a real  Ukraine Communist Party came along.    Both during the years of his leadership in the notorious  "Group of 239" and after the emergence of the Socialist Party  Aleksandr Moroz really showed himself as a fairly flexible,  open-minded and often pragmatic politician: as is known, when a  person is elected to a high post, such qualities only grow.  Moroz, however, is a representative of a small faction, owing  his success primarily to support from communists. Still the  lineup of forces in the Ukraine Supreme Soviet is unlike in  Russia's, and Ivan Rybkin has considerably more room for  maneuver than Aleksandr Moroz. Especially since an argument in  favor of Rybkin's flexibility is a strong president. And what  is the argument in favor of Moroz' flexibility? Presidential  elections?    The very first days of the new parliament showed that  Aleksandr Moroz will have to repay the debts to the strongest  faction in the Supreme Soviet. When he was already enjoying the  position of a virtual head of parliament, presiding over its  session which discussed the fate of deputies elected in  uncontested constituencies, Moroz behaved rather tactlessly, in  a partisan manner, with respect to a leader in the Interregional  Reforms Bloc, Vladimir Grinev, and yet another deputy from the  non-left camp, Pavel Kudyukin. A new scandal emerged after  Moroz was elected Supreme Council chairman: the opposition  wrecked the session, apparently fearing that Communist Party  representatives would be elected deputy speakers.    The realignment of forces in the new Supreme Council is  strikingly reminiscent of the situation that existed in the  first days of the old, still very Soviet, parliament: the left  can do everything but the opposition can thwart a session.  Therefore agreement will have to be reached with it. However  the aggravated situation around Crimea and the need to resolve  the fate of the upcoming 26 presidential elections, whose  cancellation is so actively sought by Leonid Kravchuk, could  prevent the opposition from boycotting parliament indefinitely.  Agreement may have to reached immediately, in haste, and only  temporarily: that is, of course, unless Aleksandr Moroz  transforms into an Ivan Rybkin faster that the parliamentary  balance of forces allows him to.</p>

			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> DYSART TO BAR: 'MORE FREEBIES'  </P> <P> Richard Dysart, who plays a senior partner on NBC's "L.A. Law" television  series, encouraged real-life Kentucky lawyers to do more volunteer legal work.  </P> <P> Dysart, who plays Leland McKenzie on the series, was the keynote speaker Friday  at a banquet for the Kentucky Bar Assn.  </P> <P> Dysart also played McKenzie in a 30-second public service announcement taped  Friday for the KBA. Dysart did the tape free in hopes lawyers will follow suit  and perform more volunteer legal work.  </P> <P> "I say if it gets one Kentucky lawyer to go out to a senior citizens center and  show someone how to fill out a government medical form, it's worth the effort,"  Dysart said.  </P></p>

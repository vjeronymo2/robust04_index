			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BUSINESS PULSE;  </P> <P> SMALL BUSINESS IN ORANGE COUNTY;  </P> <P> BUTCHERS, BAKERS, MICROCHIP MAKERS;  </P> <P> ENTERPRISES THRIVE IN AN ECONOMIC GREENHOUSE  </P> <P> All around the country, in growing numbers, people are closing their eyes,  gritting their teeth, mortgaging their homes, cashing in their retirement  accounts and taking the biggest crap shoot of their careers by starting their  own businesses.  </P> <P> And nowhere is the entrepreneurial urge more evident than in Orange County,  where nearly 100 new businesses were begun each working day last year.  </P> <P> Orange County, in fact, has become a hotbed of small-business activity, a petri  dish culture of cutting-edge capitalism. And the rich mix that fertilizes  business development here is expected to produce bountiful growth for years to  come.  </P> <P> "This is a breeding ground for new business," said Chapman College economist  James Doti. "We have the colleges and a core of high-technology firms and they  throw off people who start their own businesses, and those businesses create  the need for service businesses. And it goes on and on."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Dominant Industry  </P> <P> Of the more than 80,000 operating businesses in Orange County, 96% have 50 or  fewer employees and 64% have no more than five workers. Those proportions  aren't unusual, business statisticians say. Small firms make up the bulk of the  business base of most communities.  </P> <P> What is different about Orange County is that there is no big oil cartel or  monolithic auto industry dominating the local economy, as in Houston or  Detroit. Instead of a collection of similar concerns all feeding into and off  of a single industry, Orange County's business base is made up of a little bit  of just about everything.  </P> <P> The federal government recognizes 970 different types of businesses, and at  least 720 of them are present in Orange County. In most regional economies, the  presence of even 500 different types of businesses would be remarkable,  according to specialists like Terry Hill of the National Federation of  Independent Business.  </P> <P> It is this diversity that has helped the county's economy remain strong through  several recessions in the last 2 decades.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Post-Industrial Landscape  </P> <P> And it is this diversity that economists and sociologists cite in  characterizing Orange County as a leading example of a new post-industrial  landscape, in which tens of thousands of small, constantly changing enterprises  coalesce to deliver goods and services far more efficiently than America's  aging industrial giants and corporate conglomerates ever could.  </P> <P> Management guru Tom Peters, in a recent speech, called the Orange County area  "the most exciting economy on Earth."  </P> <P> And Alan J. Scott of UCLA, an economic geographer and urban analyst, cited  Orange County as a model for "the new patterns of industrialization and  urbanization that are now being laid down on the American economic landscape."  </P> <P> Both said they find the county exciting because of its dynamic community of  small businesses which, by necessity, are able to rapidly adapt to a changing  environment.  </P> <P> Local business owners seem to agree with that assessment.  </P> <P> In a recent survey of 522 small-business owners conducted for the The Times  Orange County Edition by Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates, 88% of the  respondents rated the county good or excellent as a business location.  </P> <P> But a vibrant economy like Orange County's is sure to experience its share of  growing pains, and the Times Small Business Poll reflects a few rough spots in  the local landscape.  </P> <P> Predictably, the problems tend to be linked directly to the phenomenal growth  and development -- Orange County's population has soared from 650,000 to 2.2  million in the past 3 decades -- that has helped make the county such a fertile  place for business formation.  </P> <P> Traffic congestion and the inadequacy of the surface transportation system  topped the list of troubles, with 46% of the survey respondents calling it a  big problem for their businesses and 37% saying it is somewhat of a problem.  </P> <P> The soaring cost of homes -- and the lack of sufficient housing to satisfy  demand -- ranked second on the list of problems adversely affecting county  businesses, followed by the cost of commercial land and rents, the cost of  labor, the supply of labor, and difficulties in dealing with local government  regulations.  </P> <P> Despite the problems, 51% of the respondents said they expect to expand their  facilities in the county over the next 5 years, while a whopping 86% said they  expect to increase employment within the same period.  </P> <P> But why is the small-business community so strong here? And what has made the  county an incubator for innovative enterprises?  </P> <P> Simply stated, the county has an infrastructure geared to support business,  said Michael D. Ames, a professor of management at Cal State Fullerton and  director of the university's Small Business Institute.  </P> <P> Ames defined that infrastructure as "physical assets, plus people, plus  mechanisms for improvement" and cited the planning of prezoned industrial parks  in communities like Irvine as a major factor in the business boom that has  given the county a $60-billion annual economy.  </P> <P> The county also tends to attract people from higher socioeconomic strata, Ames  said. That, in turn, has created a financial and educational base to support  new businesses and a cadre of trained or easily trainable workers and managers  to run them.  </P> <P> Ames and other business specialists agree that the county has entered an era in  which traffic congestion, the high cost of housing and the increasing labor  shortages are eroding some of the area's attractiveness.  </P> <P> "But we haven't done too shabbily so far," Ames said, "and we have the  mechanisms for improvement to help address things like land costs. We have  people who are clever in designing products people really want and in designing  efficient ways to make them so we can squeeze more out of each square foot,  often with fewer employees."  </P> <P> While the infrastructure is important, the county's role as a business  incubator is equally dependent on two factors that aren't man-made: climate and  location.  </P> <P> Industrial psychologist Michael Anthony, deputy director of the Orange County  Business Development Center, said the county has prospered precisely because  this isn't Council Bluffs, Iowa, or Mandan, N.D.  </P> <P> "Orange County began as a vacation spot, then became a choice living place for  executives, and then they started bringing their businesses down from Los  Angeles with them," Anthony said.  </P> <P> James G. Rourke, a partner in the law firm of Rourke &amp; Woodruff in Orange,  has been in Orange County since 1956. "The semi-rural life style appealed to me  then," he said, "and I have to admit that I didn't foresee that it wouldn't  last long. But the trade-off has been the development of other amenities, so  you don't have to go to Los Angeles for entertainment like you did 35 years  ago. And without that growth, we wouldn't have the vibrant economy that makes  this one of the most excellent places in the country to have a business."  </P> <P> The county's position between Los Angeles and San Diego counties, with their  stables of large aerospace and defense contractors, have also been of  considerable importance in developing a healthy small-business community, said  Frank Swain, author of the Small Business Administration's annual report on the  state of small business in the United States.  </P> <P> The final ingredient is the presence a large number of educational  institutions, including several 4-year colleges, eight community colleges and a  major university.  </P> <P> They have provided the basis for the latest wave of small-business formation:  the electronics and medical and biomedical research firms that have helped turn  the county into a leading technology center, said Chapman College's Doti.  </P> <P> And that makes Doti sanguine about the future, despite the complaints about  traffic congestion, air pollution, expensive housing and labor shortages.  </P> <P> "This has become a high-priced area, and the higher wage rates that are needed  argue against some specific types of firms being here," he said.  </P> <P> "But the county is attracting companies in the business services and  high-technology areas," Doti said. "And these companies tend to offer higher  pay and are highly specialized, so we get diversity and a lot of new employment  of people who can afford to live here."  </P> <P> </P> <P> O.C.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any new or reconstructed sources would be required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adhere to the compliance schedule in &sect;63.6(b) of subpart A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the general provisions. For new or reconstructed sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whose startup date is before the effective date of the rule,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the compliance date would be the effective date of the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For new or reconstructed sources whose startup date is after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the effective date of the rule, the compliance date would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the startup date. A new unaffected area source that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increases its emissions (or potential to emit) such that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> becomes a major source would be required to comply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately upon becoming a major source.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many shipyards in California have been complying with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VOC limits equal to those in the proposed BACM since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> September 1991. Hence, coatings that meet the limits should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be readily available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Selection of Compliance Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would allow affected sources to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> choose from five options for demonstrating compliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the VOHAP standards. Regardless of the option(s) chosen,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for each coating, affected sources would be required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first determine: (1) its coating category in Table 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e.g., general use, air flask, antenna, etc.), (2) the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable VOHAP limit, and (3) the VOC (or VOHAP) content  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for each manufactured batch of coating. The VOC (or VOHAP)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> content of the batch would be determined through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification as explained in part III.D. (It is in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> best interest of affected sources to use manufacturers that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certify their coatings.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For options 1 through 4 involving VOC content  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determinations, the compliance method is the Agency's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Method 24. Affected sources would be allowed any of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods described below to avoid testing every container.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ultimate referee method, however, is Method 24.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Option 5 involves VOHAP content determinations; the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance method has to be approved by the Administrator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and comply with EPA requirements for sample preparation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule does not specify compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures for the handling, transfer, and storage standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each affected source would be required to develop and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include specific compliance procedures for their facility in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the initial notification to the Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An affected source would be allowed to select any of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the following methods for compliance and may choose to use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only one of the options for all coatings at the facility or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use a combination of options.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Option 1. Certification of Each Container or Coating, As-Applied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Procedures for certifying the quantity of VOC emitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by paints, ink, and other coatings are combined in the EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication 450/3&hyph;84&hyph;019 (revised 6/86). Compliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the VOHAP content limits would be achieved by sampling,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing, and certifying the VOC content of each container of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coating, as applied. If the as-applied VOC content is less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than or equal to the VOHAP limit in Table 1, the coating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Option 2. Coatings To Which Thinning Solvent Will Not Be Added  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If thinning solvents will not be added to the coating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under any circumstances, the affected source may demonstrate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the VOHAP content limit by certifying the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as-applied VOC content by manufacturer's batch. The as-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied certification may be based on a coating that has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been certified by the manufacturer as to the as-supplied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> content and simply requires documentation that no thinning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solvent was added to the coating. No additional testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All painters would have to be notified that no thinning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solvent may be added to the coating before application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notification may be accomplished through a label  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affixed to each container in the batch or through another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> means of notification specified in the source's initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification that is required in &sect;63.9(b) of subpart A of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the general provisions. Other means of notifying painters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may include use of a bar coding system or posting of a list  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of coatings that should not have thinning solvents added.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This option is the least burdensome to affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources, but it may only be used for coatings that will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be thinned. However, any Method 24 tests on individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containers of coating, as applied, that show noncompliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the standards would take precedence and indicate a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Jose Marrero Camacho, member of </F> the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba and  president of the Provincial Assembly of the People's Government  in Vuelta Abajo, Pinar del Rio Province, by Guillermo Cabrera in  Pinar del Rio -- live]    [Text] [Cabrera] The country is seriously trying to  streamline internal finances and especially to make the economic  policy more effective. What is Pinar del Rio doing in this  regard?    [Marrero] Well, as you said, what Pinar del Rio is doing,  and  what we did initially, is to try to be more effective in our  production, especially taking into account the fact that we have  lost millions in our agriculture, in our Sugar Industry Ministry  [Minaz], in our production. The first measure to adopt, and  which we are doing, is discussing in each workers' meeting the  process being carried out jointly with the Cuban Workers  Federation, the workers' parliament in the workplace, discussing  the things that can be done there to reduce production costs, to  be more effective in our activities. These are the main measures.    [Cabrera] Excuse me, Marrero, how much did Pinar del Rio  lose  last year?    [Marrero] Some 400 million [currency not specified] taking  into account the losses in the agriculture and construction  sectors, the Minaz, and even the expenses incurred by the  people's government. According to the latest figures we have  been assessing, the loss totals approximately 389 million  [currency not specified]. We must also mention other measures,  as you said, which are being adopted. But the essential ones  are: how to produce more and how to produce more effectively.  And at what level are we taking these measures? We are taking  them at the level of the people's council. This a subject being  discussed at the people's council. We can see how our president,  the members of our council are participating in each of these  centers, evaluating suggestions, seeing what can be done, and  where are our failures, seeking to solve these problems. If we  manage to reduce our loss by 50 percent this year, it will be  200 million [currency not specified], and 200 million with other  measures. But this is not easy to achieve. However, we see that  50 percent is due to inefficiency in production. We are seeing  this in an essential sector. We are seeing this in the  agricultural area, especially that having to do with tobacco. We  are getting ready for a historical harvest. The climate is good,  but we can see that salary cost in the tobacco field is 50  percent of our salary costs in other places. We can better  employ our labor force, we can reduce the daily movements of  workers; we can better organize our battalions, and the Basic  Cooperative Production Units [UBPC] will work more efficiently.  So, there is an economic awareness which is leading people to  see where they are spending each centavo, where are our  resources are invested to make our production more efficient.    [Cabrera] How is the government working to....    [Station announcer] Well, we have lost our communications  with Pinar del Rio Province. We are going to try a new contact  later through Radio Guama.</p>

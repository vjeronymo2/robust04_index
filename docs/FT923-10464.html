			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Latin American Debt Crisis: 'A great deal was at stake' - Jacques de Larosiere / The Key International Personalities / Ten years ago next month the Latin American debt crisis broke - and threw the world financial system into turmoil. On these pages writers who followed the story for the Financial Times from the outset analyse how the crisis was handled. And they pose the question: Is there life after debt? ALL the ingredients of a systemic crisis were present when the international debt crisis broke out in August 1982. The combined foreign debt of the three largest Latin American countries alone came to nearly Dollars 230bn and the portion of this debt owed to commercial banks stood at Dollars 150bn. Comparing this figure to the capital of the international banks that had the greatest exposures in Latin America, we can see that their financial structures were in no way capable of withstanding unilateral and chaotic suspension of payments by the three leading Latin American debtors. It was calculated that, in 1982, the claims on Mexico alone accounted for 44 per cent of the capital of the nine largest US banks. In August 1982, the debtor countries were faced with an acute liquidity crisis. The maturity structure of their external bank debt had become much shorter, at a time when the economic climate was marked by recession, high interest rates and falling commodity prices. A great deal was at stake for all the parties concerned. For the banks with the largest exposures, their very survival was in question. The fact that these banks played a key role in the international financial system meant that the system itself was ultimately in jeopardy. You can imagine what the consequences of a failure of the financial system would have been. The stakes were equally high for the debtor countries, even though the risks they incurred were less obvious to some. A unilateral breach of contractual commitments would have led to a loss of credibility. This would have cut them off from sources of international finance for a very long time, in view of the importance of external capital for these countries' long-term economic development. It was clear to me that it would have been a major mistake for them just to stand by and let the crisis develop without taking any action. The strategy drawn up in August 1982 was simple; it has been developed and further refined with the passing years. It was based on the idea that there are two parties to each debt problem - the debtor and the creditor - and that both parties should be part of the solution. As the problem mainly seemed to be one of liquidity, and not solvency, the solution was to: 1 - Ask debtor countries to adjust their economic policy so as to eliminate the sources of the deficit that led to the debt in the first place. This called for strong macro-economic stabilisation measures, involving fiscal and monetary policy, and structural adjustment policies aimed at making their production system more flexible by freeing prices, opening markets to international trade and privatising industries. 2 - Ask creditors to give these tighter economic policies and adjustment programmes time to work. This assumed that the banks and public sector creditors would agree to reschedule principal repayments, and even supply new money, so that the debtors could meet their interest payments, which must never be interrupted. This strategy had at its hub the International Monetary Fund, which was to play a crucial role in reaching agreements with debtor countries on adjustment programmes, backed by IMF resources, and in arranging and catalysing the finance needed for the transition period, whether it came from creditor states, banks or development institutions. One of the fundamental rules applied to the approach chosen was that each problem and each country had its own individual characteristics. Therefore, it was not a matter of finding a universal and uniform solution, but of addressing the problems on a case-by-case basis. Most of the ideas I have just spelled out seem self-evident today. At the time, though, they were hotly contested in some circles, particularly among academics. It was said that the problem was so intractable that it called for universal solution of debt relief or forgiveness, but nobody would say just who should come up with the financing needed. Furthermore, it was predicted that a 'cartel' of defaulters would be created and the programmes negotiated by the IMF were seen as too harsh. For once, events actually moved in a constructive and favourable direction. The success in the handling of the crisis was due to four main elements: a good concept (diagnosis and treatment), strong leadership, speed in execution, and intensive co-operation among different players. Mr de Larosiere, governor of the Bank of France, was managing director of the International Monetary Fund in 1978-86.</p>

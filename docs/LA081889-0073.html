			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S ASHES TO ASHES FOR PERKS WHEN CONGRESSMEN DEPART  </P> <P> While Claude Pepper lived, his office was a five-room suite, among the best on  Capitol Hill. With Pepper gone and no successor in place, his staff is winding  up his work in two storerooms with an air shaft for a view.  </P> <P> "Our quarters are so cramped, we figured the animal rights people would be  protesting," said Rochelle Jones, longtime press secretary for the Florida  congressman.  </P> <P> The experiences of Pepper's staff undoubtedly differ little from those of Reps.  Jim Wright and Tony Coelho, who resigned, and Mickey Leland and Larkin Smith,  who were killed in recent plane crashes.  </P> <P> Pepper, the champion of the elderly, enjoyed the power and perks that grow with  seniority, and his staff shared them, too. When he died, the perks died for his  staff as well.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'It's Over With'  </P> <P> "When a member dies, it's over with," said Ray Colley, the deputy clerk of the  House who supervises the transitions when a congressman leaves and another  takes his place.  </P> <P> When Pepper staffers returned from his funeral in June, there was a message  from the clerk's office: The telephone should no longer be answered  "Congressman Claude Pepper's office." It was to be "18th Congressional District  of Florida."  </P> <P> At about the same time, Jones recalls, a procession of congressmen and their  staffs came by to look over Pepper's office, which was in a prime location in  the Rayburn Office Building -- commensurate with his 27 years in the House.  </P> <P> "They were really ghoulish people looking over the remains," Jones said. "Five  different people put in a bid for the office."  </P> <P> When congressional suites become vacant, other members bid on them and they are  awarded on the basis of seniority.  </P> <P> The visitors included congressmen and others who wanted post-death autographs  on books and pictures -- before the automatic signing pen was put away.  </P> <P> "I can understand the staff's concern about not being able to answer 'Sen.  Pepper' but he's not Sen. Pepper any more," Colley said. Many old-timers on  Capitol Hill still referred to Pepper as senator, since he served in the Senate  for 14 years.  </P> <P> Some of the Pepper perks were gone before the sun set on his grave.  </P> <P> "I had a parking space in Rayburn that was just great -- a few steps from the  elevator," Jones said. "One day I came in and found (Texas congressman) Jack  Brooks using my parking space. It was my notification that the space was no  longer mine."  </P> <P> Pepper died May 30 at age 88. The funeral was June 5 in Florida. His  congressional seat will be filled in a special election Aug. 29, but until then  his staff takes care of district business.  </P> <P> At the end of June, the Pepper staff was told to move into two rooms among  storage spaces on the sixth floor of the Longworth House Office Building next  door -- with a view of an air shaft. The move meant packing up the  congressman's belongings, first for the office switch, then for transfer to the  Federal Records Center.  </P> <P> "Pepper was in office from 1962. He never threw away a piece of paper," Jones  said. "I found personnel files of people who worked there in the 1960s.  </P> <P> "The Rayburn office was filled with memorabilia. It was a living museum,  pictures of Pepper with all the presidents he's known since Roosevelt, pictures  of Pepper with celebrities. One wall was filled just with legislation he had  participated in, from the cross-Florida barge canal to Social Security reform."  </P> <P> Pepper's personal things, including the hundreds of pictures and dozens of pens  from bill signings, will go to the Mildred and Claude Pepper Library at Florida  State University in Tallahassee.  </P> <P> Pepper's office was assigned by the clerk's office to Rep. Dale E. Kildee  (D-Mich.), who is in his seventh term.  </P> <P> "We are very careful to answer the phone '18th Congressional District of  Florida,' " Jones said. "There is usually a pause, then 'is this Congressman  Pepper's office?' People still call up; they need help getting a visa; a  year-old Medicare claim hasn't been paid."  </P> <P> The staff toils on, winding up the Pepper era.  </P> <P> "People have stopped answering our phone calls," Jones said.  </P> <P> That, in Washington, is the ultimate loss of power.  </P></p>

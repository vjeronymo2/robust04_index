			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Bridging the credibility gap - Chris Tighe considers the implications for the regional economy This morning, the chairman and chief executive of Trafalgar House, the engineering and property conglomerate bidding for Northern Electric, will pose for photographs beside the Tyne Bridge. In choosing this backdrop, the most evocative and immediately recognisable symbol of Tyneside, Trafalgar is acknowledging the importance of regional identity in its fight to buy the north-east of England's regional electricity company. Trafalgar's choice of photo location is a bold attempt to emphasise its local links. In 1982 it took over Dorman Long, builder of the Tyne Bridge, and it now owns 14 companies in the region. These include Cleveland Structural Engineering, successor to the company which built two of the Tyne's other big bridges. Local control is an important issue in a region pre-occupied by the problems of high unemployment, being geographically peripheral, the paucity of locally-based quoted companies and the need to maintain quality jobs for its university graduates. 'This isn't about Trafalgar House, it's about the loss of control of a regional company,' said Mr Doug Henderson, Labour MP for Newcastle North. He wrote yesterday to the Office of Fair Trading, urging an investigation. Mr Henderson is worried that the bid could trigger rapid concentration of rec ownership, reducing competitiveness and technological edge. It could also cost the region much needed jobs, especially if the rec's headquarters lost decision-making autonomy. North-east England has only 24 plcs with local headquarters, of which Northern Electric is the largest. Despite some new listings this year, this figure has remained fairly static. 'It's sad that as soon as we tend to get them, a lot get taken over,' said analyst Mr John Dickinson, a director of stockbrokers Wise Speke, based round the corner from Northern's Newcastle headquarters. Yesterday, Mr Arthur Foord, the Confederation of British Industry's northern region director, while stressing that he was not criticising Trafalgar, expressed concern at the loss of headquarters from the region. 'It's important that management expertise at the senior level is held within the region because that influences investment in plants.' Newcastle-based Mr Mike Darrington, managing director of Greggs plc, Britain's biggest bakery chain, shares Mr Foord's apprehensions. 'I don't like seeing businesses based in the north disappearing. I don't think it's good for the north, the power is moving away.' Mr Darrington, whose company spends Pounds 4m a year on electricity from a number of recs, including Northern, added: 'As a customer I can't see any advantage to our business.' He is concerned about investment plans under Trafalgar and the possible loss of competition between recs. Emerging into the December chill from the showroom attached to Northern Electric's headquarters  - a showroom adorned with 'Buy now, pay 1995' posters  - fireman Mr Ken Gurling voiced similar concerns. 'Trafalgar House have their fingers in so many pies. 'Electric companies should be electric compan-ies.' Mr Gurling and others questioned outside the showroom were unimpressed with Trafalgar's offer of Pounds 20 off their first electricity bill after the takeover. Loyalty to Northern was coupled with some opposition to the privatisation of the electricity industry. Some feared further job losses. 'I've had dealings with Trafalgar House; they're commercial, profit orientated. There would be job cuts,' said interior designer Mr Richard Rycroft. The Pounds 20 was, he said, a 'sweetener'. Labour's chief whip, Mr Derek Foster, was blunter still, calling it the 'bribe of the century' offered in an attempt to 'hijack' one of the north's leading companies. Sale of the National Grid shares, added Mr Foster, could bring Pounds 325m into Northern's coffers. Unions representing Northern's 4,000 employees are committed to fighting the bid. 'The board is saying they also wish to retain independence, but our concern is that money talks,' said Mr Dave Harrison, chairman of the joint unions. Although the unions have been critical of Northern's plans, still under negotiation, to shed 800 jobs, they would prefer, he said, to see the company retain its independence. 'It's a case of better the devil you know.'</p>

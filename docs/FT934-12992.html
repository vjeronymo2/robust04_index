			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: National lottery The creation of the national lottery is likely to lead to some significant shifts in consumer spending patterns. If Mr Peter Brooke's predictions prove correct, the British public may splash out Pounds 1.5bn on tickets a year. Some estimates suggest this could climb as high as Pounds 3bn. The stock market is already speculating about the winners and losers in this furious flutter. Football pools are bound to be hit. For stock market investors, the main worry concerns Ladbroke. But Vernons represents a relatively small proportion of Ladbroke's total profits. Pub and club operators, such as Rank and Bass, may lose money from slot machines. Other forms of gambling may not suffer so badly. The regulars who bet on the 2.30 at Kempton doubtless believe this is more a matter of skill than chance. Newspapers, magazines and confectionery may lose sales. The government could lose much of its premium bond revenue. The consortia scrambling to operate the lottery will surely see their returns limited by political considerations. But retailers who sell lottery tickets may do nicely by keeping perhaps 5 per cent of the price with minimal outlay on their part. Television companies, too, can expect to win advertising revenue. But the real prize will go to the advertising agency which wins the contract for what is likely to become the UK's biggest consumer product.</p>

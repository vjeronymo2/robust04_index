			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Zagreb, March 3 (AFP) -- The commander of UN  troops in the former Yugoslavia, General Jean Cot, on Thursday  [3 March] asked the United States to rush troops to  Bosnia-Herzegovina to consolidate the ceasefire, particularly in  Sarajevo.    The UN Secretary General's special envoy for the region,  Yasushi Akashi, meanwhile criticized the international community  for its "lukewarm and negative response up to date" on the  urgent need to send reinforcements to Bosnia. He said the UN  Protection Force (UNPROFOR) needed an additional 10,650 troops  immediately, 4,600 of them to be deployed in Sarajevo and the  remainder to monitor a ceasefire agreement between the Moslems  and Bosnian Croats in central and southern Bosnia.    Cot echoed Akashi's criticism saying that NATO's readiness  to  send troops to Bosnia only after a global peace accord is  reached "was a funny and not very courageous idea." "They can  all change their mind and send troops tomorrow if they wanted,"  he said. "I really wish the United States could dispatch ground  troops tomorrow.    "What I need are troops immediately and the nations that can  send send these troops immediately can be counted on one hand --  the Americans, the British and the French."    He said NATO initially was considering sending 100,000  additional troops to Bosnia but the number had been reduced by  half, to 50,000.    "Today, I'm asking for 10,000, and if they don't want all  the  headway we've made in Sarajevo to fall through, we need these  troops immediately," Cot warned. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile in Britain, a serious clash is looming between the  British Government and defence chiefs over the government's  refusal to send more troops to Bosnia, the DAILY TELEGRAPH  reported Thursday. Military service chiefs say the 2,300 troops  there are so thinly spread that they could be dangerously  exposed if the war worsens, it said.</p>

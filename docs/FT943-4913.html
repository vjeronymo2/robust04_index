			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Reynolds meets Sinn Fein as Major halts talks with Paisley: Unionists condemn Dublin discussions - PM refuses to hear DUP protests Seventy years of Irish history were turned upside down yesterday as Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, shook hands in Dublin with the Sinn Fein leader, Mr Gerry Adams, and Mr John Major ejected Mr Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, from a meeting in Downing Street. Mr Reynolds' meeting with Mr Adams marked the re-emergence of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, as a mainstream party for the first time since the Irish civil war in the 1920s. The meeting was attended by Mr John Hume, head of the mainly nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, and in a statement the three leaders said: 'We are at the beginning of a new era in which we are all totally and absolutely committed to democratic and peaceful methods of resolving our political problems.' The meeting was condemned by rightwing Conservative MPs and Unionist leaders, who claimed that Dublin had broken an agreement not to meet Sinn Fein leaders for three months after a permanent ceasefire. However, Mr Major refused to listen to protests from Mr Paisley, the most popular Unionist politician in Northern Ireland, during a meeting at Downing Street. As Mr Paisley attempted to read a prepared statement, Mr Major three times demanded an assurance that the DUP leader would accept his word that no secret deals had been done. When Mr Paisley refused to give such an assurance, Mr Major abruptly ended the meeting. The confrontation followed a meeting of senior British ministers, chaired by Mr Major, which agreed that the government would continue to demand guarantees of a permanent IRA ceasefire before entering talks with Sinn Fein. The government's approach was broadly endorsed by Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, and Lord Holme, the Liberal Democrat spokesman on Northern Ireland, marking a cross-party rejection of the Irish government's desire for fast progress towards all-party talks. Mr Blair said the government was 'right to be cautious and not to engage in direct negotiations until a proper period has passed so that we can gauge whether the cessation of violence is indeed permanent'. British officials said Mr Reynolds' meeting with Sinn Fein was 'premature'. However, they said the meeting would not interfere with progress towards a framework agreement on the next stage of the Northern Ireland peace process, which the two governments hope to produce before Christmas. The continued caution in London contrasted sharply with the optimistic tone of the Dublin statement, in which the three nationalist leaders said their objective was to build upon the IRA ceasefire announcement last week to achieve 'an equitable and lasting agreement' for Ireland's future. They appealed to Unionists in Northern Ireland to join in talks. Mr Reynolds said Mr Major wanted an assurance 'that it is for real; that it is over'. He said: 'I hope that our statement here today, representing the sense of the meeting, will indeed help him along that road.' He challenged his critics, saying: 'To those people who say 'Why so soon?' my answer has to be - it is never too soon to save a life, and never too soon to stop the killing.' Unionist leaders reacted angrily. Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, said he was 'astonished' the Dublin meeting had taken place. 'Mr Adams has at his back a private army still with thousands of weapons, still with tons of munitions at his disposal,' he said. 'For an Irish prime minister to meet with the leader of a subversive organisation who has got his private army intact is really quite astounding.' Mr Andrew Hunter, chairman of the Conservative backbench Northern Ireland committee, said the meeting was 'a disastrous miscalculation by the Irish government, and potentially it has most damaging consequences'. He said there was 'grave concern that the Irish government is scuppering the process by bending over backwards to appease the IRA'. In Belfast yesterday Republican sources indicated that the IRA had no intention in the medium term of being more specific about the meaning of its ceasefire. 'We have entered an unarmed stage of our struggle for self-determination for the Irish people,' a Republican source said.

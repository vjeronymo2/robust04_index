			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Survey of Information Technology in Europe (1):  The barriers are falling - Europe's expansion as an increasingly unified trading area is fuelling hectic competition among information systems suppliers. At issue is how much of this market will be served by local industries and how much by the US and Japan THE European information technology industry is looking forward to a number of benefits from the creation of a single European market. It assumes that: The market will spur demand for information and communication systems capable of spanning national borders as barriers fall and businesses take advantage of the enlarged market. Corporations will rely more on information systems to disseminate information across the wider business networks. Financial institutions will boost their IT capability to provide pan-European banking and other financial services. Demand for mobile telephones will surge as travel throughout the EC increases and as users become able to communicate with the same mobile handset from anywhere in the Community. Manufacturers will be encouraged to adopt computer-integrated manufacturing, computer-assisted design and other systems as competition in many sectors intensifies. This, at least, is the rosy picture being painted by the IT industry. It has lured the world's leading IT manufacturers, from the fast-moving computer groups of the US to the large, integrated electronics giants of Japan, to set up bases within the EC. Europe will be the largest market in the world and foreign manufacturers have been making huge investments to take advantage of the opportunities on offer. European manufacturers, for their part, are struggling to regain the initiative in the marketplace, fearful of losing their growing home market to outside competition. As the foreign presence within their borders has come to be felt even more strongly than before, European electronics and computer manufacturers have been forced to accelerate moves to turn ailing businesses round. They are being forced to question the narrow insularity that has made it difficult for companies from one European country to collaborate closely with those from another and to examine the barriers of custom and practice that have made it virtually impossible for a whole range of information technology products to find a Europe-wide market with the economies of scale that implies. The Community has, however, faced a growing dilemma over whether to continue to support an interventionist approach that aims to create national or European 'champions' or to opt for strategies based more on commercial and business considerations. The signs from Brussels are that patience is growing thin with organisations that look for subsidies as an aid to competitiveness. Pumping money into uncompetitive businesses or merging weak European partners is now recognised as unlikely to produce an effective champion. European companies, too, have often seen greater benefits for themselves in alliances with the stronger technologies of US or Japanese companies. In the semiconductor industry, hopes for the formation of a strong European manufacturer through the merger of a number of leading groups were abandoned when Siemens of Germany agreed a memory chip venture with IBM. The remaining groups were left to seek strategic alliances and partnerships to suit their own particular needs. Late last year, Bull, the French computer maker, also reached a partnership deal with IBM. Thomson, the French electronics group, meanwhile, is being compelled by its government owner to take a rather odd turn down the industrial policy route. It is threatening to force it to merge with CEA-Industrie, the state nuclear and fuel business. Despite this particular setback, Europe's indigenous capability in IT is still being sought in a less dramatic way by manufacturers throughout the Community as well as the Commission. Partnerships between semiconductor manufacturers have been formed, such as that between SGS-Thomson and Philips on the next generation semiconductor technology and between SGS-Thomson and GEC Plessey in semi-custom chips used by the telecommunications and computer industries. The European-owned computer manufacturers are striking a variety of deals and alliances to give them, first, access to technologies which are not available from European suppliers, and second, expanded markets for their products. Volume sales are now critical for computer companies which have seen the profit margins on their systems collapse, driven by the widespread availability of industry-standard components and a trend to 'downsizing' - using smaller, lower costs systems to carry out tasks previously carried out by mainframes or minicomputers - among their customers. Siemens, of Germany a powerhouse of the European electronics industry, is the owner of Nixdorf through the joint venture Siemens-Nixdorf Information Systems, but has an alliance in mainframes and supercomputers with Fujitsu of Japan. It has recently sold its share in Comparex, which distributed Hitachi mainframes and other computing equipment in Europe, to its co-owner BASF. Groupe Bull of France, a heavy loss maker in recent years, is beginning to regain credibility with its broad ranging deal with IBM - it gets access to IBM's advanced chip technology for personal computers and workstations which in turn gives IBM greater sales potential for its chips. Olivetti of Italy has yet to seal a wide-ranging alliance with either a US or Japanese supplier, but it works closely with the major technology suppliers including Intel and Microsoft and supplies Digital Equipment of the US with personal computers. Joint R&amp;D efforts under pan-European programmes such as Esprit and Eureka continue under the umbrella of the EC's 'framework programmes,' which receive a budget covering five years work from the Commission. The latest framework programme was agreed last month with a Community budget that will be worth Ecu86bn annually. Meanwhile, the European Commission itself has had to balance the demands of the interventionists and its commitment to the rules of competition and free trade. The situation has, at times, resulted in an uneasy compromise. Pressure from manufacturers and concern about building a European capability in high definition television (HDTV), for example, led the Commission to set up a standard and agenda for HDTV that aims to further the European industrial cause. As a result, the European HDTV programme has been delayed unnecessarily and the Commission's goal of nurturing indigenous industry could prove to be at the expense of the consumer. In the end, with or without intervention, 'the market itself will determine success or failure,' a point recognised by Dr Joan Majo Cruzate, adviser at the Commission. It is in the enlarged European marketplace that IT manufacturers will have to face most directly their overseas competitors, many of whom react with frank scepticism to continued talk in Europe about investment aid from the Community and national subsidies. 'Subsidies and government support are not what make winners,' says a US semiconductor group. How fast the single market in information and communication is realised will depend largely on the willingness of the individual governments to implement the necessary changes. There are still substantial obstacles to be overcome before the full benefits of integration can be enjoyed. As competition in the European IT industry intensifies over the next few years it could yet trigger renewed cries for protection from the region's beleaguered manufacturers. That, in turn, could delay the benefits to the Community.</p>

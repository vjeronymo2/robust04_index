			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURATEURS TWICE-CHALLENGED TO HELP THE NEEDY  </P> <P> Orange County restaurants were given two challenges this week to help the  needy. One was from Rex Chandler, owner of Rex Restaurant and the Oyster Bar  &amp; Grill in Newport Beach. A five-year board member of the county's American  Red Cross chapter, Chandler has asked fellow restaurateurs to designate  Saturday as "Nov. 4 for the Red Cross" and to donate 10% of the day's receipts  to the Red Cross disaster fund.  </P> <P> The fund, Chandler said, has been seriously depleted by Red Cross services to  Bay Area residents after the Northern California earthquake and to victims of  Hurricane Hugo.  </P> <P> Those wishing to participate may contact Chandler at (714) 675-2566.  </P> <P> The second challenge came from Jean Forbath, director of Save Our Selves in  Costa Mesa, a nonprofit, all-volunteer agency that responds to the emergency  needs of the county's poor.  </P> <P> SOS has "a tremendous need" for prepared food for the homeless, Forbath said.  </P> <P> County restaurants, caterers and food services already donate excess foods to  SOS, she noted.  </P> <P> But, she added, more food is needed, all year long.  </P> <P> Some catering trucks bring food in to SOS at day's end. Other contributors  include the test kitchens at Grace Restaurant Service in Irvine and  Showley-Wrightson in Newport Beach. And some restaurants, according to grateful  SOS personnel, "just bring food by, without identifying themselves."  </P> <P> SOS is at 661 Hamilton St., Costa Mesa. For information, call (714) 642-3451.  BEVERLY BUSH SMITH  </P></p>

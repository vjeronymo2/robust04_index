			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Leader balloting rules clarified The Labour party will elect its next leader by single transferable vote after taking advice from its solicitors following the confusion which arose over interpretation of rules passed by last year's annual conference. Rule 2(c) states that a candidate must receive half of the votes cast in the election in order to win. If this does not happen on the first ballot, 'further ballots shall be held on an elimination basis'. This could have been interpreted as meaning the party would have to hold a series of ballots and go back to the electorate involved each time. The party's lawyers have recommended to the ruling National Executive Committee that this can be interpreted to cover ballot voting with electors giving preferences among more than two candidates. The NEC is expected to decide when to hold the leadership election at a meeting on May 25. The choice is between proceeding quickly, with the result announced at a special one-day conference by the end of July, or waiting until the party's annual conference in early October.</p>

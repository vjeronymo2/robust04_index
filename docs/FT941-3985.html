			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Business TV hunts for cash rescue Accountancy Television, the financially troubled training service for accountants, is urgently seeking Pounds 500,000 after its shareholders refused recent approaches to provide additional support. Details emerged as all the remaining original supporters were preparing to write off their investments in the service, which was launched two years ago as a late-night encoded subscription service transmitted on the BBC. Sir Michael Lickiss, chairman of Accountancy Television, said the company needed at least Pounds 200,000 to survive. But he was optimistic over discussions with a venture capital company. He said: 'I am very optimistic that in the very, very short term I will be able to make a satisfactory announcement.' The three institutes of chartered accountants covering the UK and Ireland, and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants are expected to write off shareholdings totalling Pounds 500,000. Last year the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants, BBC Select, which provides the encoded transmission service, and BPP, the training company, wrote off their investments. The original business plan, which Sir Michael described as 'grossly optimistic', projected that the company would break even later this year. He said it was now on target to break even next year under plans drawn up last autumn. He said that the service had 1,200 subscribers, about equally split between the TV service and a video service using some of the same material, which was launched last year. He added that he was discussin plans to introduce 'down-loading' of training programmes by video. Accountancy Television, described by one insider as 'a poisoned chalice', pitched its commercial backers against those from the professional accountancy bodies. In the past few months the chief executive of the company has left and the post has been temporarily filled by one of the remaining four staff. Recent requests for several hundreds of thousands of pounds in additional money were rejected by the accountancy bodies, which had provided a second injection after their initial investment in 1992.</p>

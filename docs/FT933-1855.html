			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Pounds 150m satellite deal takes BBC TV into Japan MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday praised a Pounds 150m deal between BBC World Service Television and Nissho Iwai, the Japanese trading group. The prime minister said: 'From next spring, Japanese viewers will be able to experience for themselves the excellence of BBC programmes specifically tailored to their own interests.' He was speaking at a reception in Tokyo to announce formally that BBC World Service Television would be launching its 24-hour news and information channel in Japan next year. Talks have been going on for months with Nissho Iwai on launching the channel which will be available 24-hours a day in English. There will be a separate Japanese translation broadcast from London for four hours each evening. The English and Japanese audio will be transmitted in stereo so that viewers can choose how much of each language to hear. The deal, worth Pounds 150m to BBC World Service Television over 10 years, provides important finance for the service launched two years ago using subscription funds raised from the BBC's entertainment satellite service in Europe. The launch was delayed because the government refused to provide any money and said the BBC could not use licence money. Critics, such as Independent Television News, say the service is subsidised by the licence fee because it calls on BBC resources. The deal increases the reach of World Service Television, which is available on the Star satellite system in Asia broadcasting to 34 countries. The service is also available in Europe, Africa and on cable television networks in Canada. In Japan, World Service Television will compete with Mr Ted Turner's Cable News Network International which is already available on cable systems and on satellite with segments of Japanese language programming. The BBC service will be distributed and managed in Japan through Satellite News Corporation, a company set up by Nissho Iwai. Revenue will come from advertising and distribution to hotels, schools, offices and direct to viewers. The BBC said yesterday that it was also in discussions with prospective partners in the US, South America, Australia and New Zealand. Sky News, the satellite television channel, will be seen in Africa from the beginning of next month. The South African Broadcasting Corporation has agreed to transmit more than 12 hours a day.</p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / How To Spend It: Crochet out of Africa ANYBODY WHO has been to Zimbabwe will remember the rows of crocheted cushion covers and bedspreads spread out in all the places where tourists gather. Crochet work is endemic, but the quality varies from the crude and inexpertly executed to the extremely finely wrought. Geraldine Jackson, who comes from that part of the world, has brought to the UK a selection of very fine quality crocheted linens. All are made by hand - which means that no measurements or designs are identical - and all use 100 per cent four-ply ecru cotton yarn. They are made by groups of Zimbabwean women gathered together by a local farmer's wife, who was distraught at the hardship caused by the drought of the last few years and who felt that truly beautiful work ought to have a ready market overseas. She insists on the highest standards and the work I have seen is very fine. Prices seem extraordinarily reasonable, given the skilled handwork. A queen-sized bedspread in the 'Bubble' (Mapuda) design, 100 in by 100 in, is Pounds 103.50. King size, 100 in by 125 in is Pounds 120 and 21 in by 15 in cushion covers are Pounds 11.75. Geraldine Jackson is preparing a full-colour catalogue of all the designs which should be ready in a couple of weeks. She has a cache of bedspreads arriving shortly but some designs may have to be made to order, which will means a wait of a few weeks. All are available from Geraldine Jackson, Pink Flamingo, 4 Cheyne Row, Thorncombe Street, Bramley, Surrey, GU 50 LU.</p>

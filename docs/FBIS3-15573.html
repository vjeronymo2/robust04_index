			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy, leader of </F> the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, by 24 CHASA Moscow  correspondent Violeta Veselinova in Moscow; date not given:  "NATO Should Be Eliminated, As It Is an Insignificant Bloc"]    [Text] Zhirinovskiy no longer wastes his time with  journalists without getting money for it. He chases them away  unless they pay in hard cash -- one minute with him costs a  newspaper $100, and a television station -- $1,000. However,  the politician who is now in the limelight made an exception for  169 CHASA so as to show that he loves the Bulgarians, even  though they have had no luck with their president.    [Veselinova] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, has the episode with Zhelev  cooled your warm feelings toward the Bulgarians?    [Zhirinovskiy] What can you do? This is what the political  struggle is like. Someone has whispered wrong things about me  into your president's ear, and he immediately took such measures  against me -- that is not nice! To expel the leader of the  party that won the elections in friendly Russia! At one time in  the past they expelled Georgi Dimitrov from Germany for alleged  subversive activities, but to expel me from Bulgaria, which I  love so much and which I was visiting as a private person....  This is how spies and smugglers are dealt with. I cannot  comprehend how freedom of speech is being suppressed in a  democratic country. They expel someone because he had allegedly  said something that the president did not like. This is stupid.  They say Prosecutor Nestor Nestorov wanted to take me to court  because of my words. This again is something monstrous. Is it  possible that Zhelev will expel everyone who has said something  against him? Thousands of Bulgarians are dissatisfied with his  rule! Will he banish all of them? Then he will be left in  Sofia on his own, together with three police departments that  will constantly repeat that he is a marvelous president.    At home in Russia, people shout "Down with Yeltsin!" every  day, yet he does not expel anyone, neither Russians nor  foreigners. I appealed through our embassy in Bulgaria against  the ultimatum ordering me out of Bulgaria within 24 hours that  your Interior Minister Viktor Mikhaylov signed, but I have not  yet been told how far the matter has gone. Everyone whom I told  how the Bulgarian president treated me has reacted with  disapproval. Not only I, but Todor Zhivkov and the Moscow  Communists also said that Bulgaria will be a Transdanubian  province and a 16th republic [of the Russian Federation].  Bulgaria and Russia should help each other and they should live  together in harmony.    [Veselinova] Why is your voice so hoarse?    [Zhirinovskiy] You journalists are to blame, you have  shattered me with your interviews. Instead of gratitude for  this, you scare the world by saying I am a fascist. How can I  be a fascist when they murdered my uncle?! (He puts on the  dress uniform jacket of a captain that he wore on Soviet Army  Day.) See, now I am in the uniform of an officer of the Soviet  Army that fought against fascism. (He chases away some BBC  journalists.) Why should I talk to you? You do not pay  anything. I will allow some time for German journalists,  because they paid me $30,000 in cash. (Yeltsin rings him on the  telephone.)    Russia has always been hedged round with enemies. (Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy roams over a map of the world using a pen light.  This is a miniature version of the terrible "Elipton" weapon  with which the chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party is  frightening the world. The ballpoint-pen-like instrument has  three buttons. If you press the first button, the laser beam  acts as a pointer. If you point the second, the other person  will collapse unconscious on the floor within three seconds. If  you press the third button, you can remove your target from the  land of the living.) Our enemies are everywhere, all around us  there are enemies, enemies.... We have been at war for 90  years. Our nation's self-confidence is due to our strong army.  We have states around us that lay claim to parts of our  territory. Finland wants Karelia, the Germans want Kaliningrad,  the Poles dream about Lviv, the Romanians want Chisinau, China  -- our Far East, Japan -- the Kuril Islands.... As for our  friends the Arabs -- Iraq, Syria, the Turks are the most  impudent -- they insist on taking the whole of the Caucasus,  Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and all the land as far as  the Altay. You see what impudence this is? Look where  Kazakhstan is. What is the result? It is that I was born  abroad. Perestroyka ruined everything.    [Veselinova] According to Nostradamus, world war III is  supposed to start any moment.    [Zhirinovskiy] There will be no war, never fear. However,  the West must take heed of our desires, and we will allow them  to keep their existing borders. We have no intention of moving  toward the West. The south is what concerns us; here is where  the war is. We are only interested in Turkey, Iran, and  Afghanistan. The Germans should not oppose us, because they too  are troubled by the Turks. If a different situation is created  in the south regarding Turkey, this will be to Germany's benefit  as well. We are ready to improve our relations with the  Germans. Why not restore the Berlin-Warsaw-Minsk-Moscow axis?  The Poles already have specific proposals in this context.  Then, later on, we can extend this axis to the Far East. The  Japanese would approve of this idea, they would even invest  money in it. How do they transport their goods now? They make  a circuit of the globe. (He draws a circle on the map with his  pen light.) It will be more beneficial for them if there is a  route to the Far East across our territory, and Russia will  receive money from the route passing through its territory.    [Veselinova] Are you afraid that NATO will stand behind  Turkey?    [Zhirinovskiy] You are mistaken if you believe that the  Turks are invulnerable because they are members of NATO. NATO  is a weak bloc. The states that are members of NATO have never  fought a war, except for Germany, and it does not want to fight.  Who will fight if they have to? The Danes? The Norwegians?  The French? The Italians? We, on the other hand, have fought  the Turks 30 times and beaten them every time. We have no  worthy opponents anywhere in the world. NATO is an  insignificant bloc, and it should be eliminated. The same goes  for the United Nations.    However, Russia is a peaceful country. We will not attack,  but we will defend ourselves if necessary. We prefer to win by  economic means instead of military ones. Anyone who imagines  that Russia is economically weak is making a serious mistake.  Russia has always been strong. Now it is simply sick -- states  fall sick just like people. However, Russia got over its  illness on 12 December 1993. Now we intend to pull ourselves  upwards by our bootstraps. In two or three years everything  will be OK with us, whereas in Germany, for example, the  situation will worsen. The rabble that has flooded in -- Turks,  Arabs, Gypsies, Romanians, the whole mafia of Eastern Europe --  will all settle there. If the Germans ask for help when things  get really bad for them, then we will come running.    The wars will continue in the world without us. We will sit  and wait; we will not meddle in the conflicts. Russia issues no  orders to anyone. We merely state our position. However, we do  not permit anyone to interfere in our own affairs, as we do not  interfere in the affairs of Spain, let us say. They have their  Basques and Catalans -- let the Spaniards themselves decide what  to do with them. Nor do we stick our noses in Britain's  troubles, despite the fact that Ireland has been drowning in  blood for 25 years now. Why, then, should they interfere in the  Slavs' problems?    [Veselinova] How did you scare NATO into not dropping bombs  on Sarajevo?    [Zhirinovskiy] It is true that the people in NATO were very  frightened. Russia's intervention happened mainly because of  the influence of our faction in parliament. When I was in  Bulgaria and Serbia, I told the journalists that if the NATO  pilots dare to bomb Serbian towns, this will mean a declaration  of war on Russia. If French pilots drop bombs, this will mean  war between France and Russia, and if German pilots do so, it  will mean war between Germany and Russia. My words had a  sobering effect on NATO. You saw that no war started. This  means I am right that NATO should dissolve itself. The United  Nations has also become outdated. We must form a new  organization -- a League of European States. Why do we  Europeans need an international organization like the United  Nations? It is a collection of states from the age of the ox  cart. Africa, Latin America, Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia  -- why should I be interested in their problems? They are at  the other end of the earth. The League should be formed between  Western and Eastern Europe. Let us solve our own problems and  leave them to solve theirs!    The Bosnian conflict is an example of the effectiveness of  the old principle of divide and rule. In three years,  Yugoslavia has been brought to its knees. The foreign  businessmen -- the Italians, French, and Germans -- have an  interest in ruining Yugoslavia's economy, just as they have in  ruining Bulgaria's. Then their goods will be bought up, because  no others will be available, and the enterprises of Serbia and  Bulgaria will go bankrupt. This is a war of the markets.    [Veselinova] Why is the world supporting the Muslims in this  conflict?    [Zhirinovskiy] This is the nub of the problem, that the  Muslim card is being played again. They allege that the  Orthodox Serbs are terrorizing the Catholics and the Muslims.  The Serbs are the most numerous. If they are destroyed or  scattered over the Balkans, there will be no one left to resist.    For five centuries the Ottoman Empire oppressed the Balkan  Slavs. Now the Turks are not only living on Bulgarian territory,  engaging in trade, and owning Turkish enterprises, but on top of  everything they are even creeping into parliament. It is to the  West's benefit to let the Slavs and Turks squabble among  themselves. It is high time the Slavs ceased being the object  of attacks. To save the Bulgarians from the Turks, they should  form an alliance with Russia. We are ready to send a division to  the Bulgarian-Turkish border. Bulgaria should not sell its land  to the Turks. It is better for Russian enterprises to purchase  this land, in return for settlement of debts. Southern Bulgaria  is a vacation zone. The miners of the Donbass will like it.    [Veselinova] Demirel is not very fond of you.    [Zhirinovskiy] I do not burn with love for him either, but  what is to be done? It is impossible for all the leaders of  parties and states to feel sympathy for one another.    [Veselinova] Why did the Austrian prostitute publish such  disgusting lies about you?    [Zhirinovskiy] I saw the article, it was published in a  German journal. Now I will sue this woman. I demand damages of  $100,000. The whole thing is a pack of lies. The lawsuit is in  progress in Germany. The aim was to undermine my reputation, to  blacken my name. Look, I spent two days in Sveti Vrach, and the  Bulgarian newspapers printed nothing compromising about me. The  Bulgarians are my friends. We only spent one evening in Vienna.  However, their intelligence service is powerful and still  operates. They certainly forced this girl to give an interview,  even though I have never set eyes on her. There is nothing  strange in the fact that they bribed her. In Bulgaria the  intelligence service has been abolished -- there is no one to  organize provocations against me, although no one in your  country is trying to throw any dirt at me. I found out that some  party gave 20 German marks each to the Turks who catcalled me at  the Memorial to the Tsar Liberator. However, we are well  practiced in using camcords and cameras, and now we have  photographs of all the participants in this paid demonstration.    [Veselinova] How is your party financed?    [Zhirinovskiy] The electors finance it. If each of our  voters donates 1,000 rubles -- the price of two packs of  cigarettes -- we will receive 12 billion. Our party has  already bought many buildings in Moscow. These will house the  offices and clubs of the Liberal Democratic Party.    [Veselinova] You are more interesting to the world than any  Hollywood star. Are you paid for your performance?    [Zhirinovskiy] I have introduced a tariff so that people  leave me in peace -- I am already extremely tired. If anyone  cannot pay to talk to me, let him go on his way! A minute's  conversation with me costs a newspaper $100, while a television  station has to pay $1,000.    [Veselinova] How does your wife react to the fact that you  are always busy?    [Zhirinovskiy] Badly. I very seldom show up at home. She  is naturally unhappy about it. We quarrel. I see my son once a  week.    [Veselinova] Is Yeltsin afraid of you?    [Zhirinovskiy] I do not insist that he should vacate the  president's office immediately. There is still time before the  elections. Yeltsin loves to give orders. Maybe he sometimes  makes mistakes -- that is only human. However, he is what he  is. Gorbachev, on the other hand, promised to improve life, and  look at what a mess he made of the country. He ruined  everything and then ran away, the coward. He is now counting  the dollars that he has been given for a job well done.    [Veselinova] Why did you not meet Clinton when he was in  Moscow?    [Zhirinovskiy] He asked for a meeting, but I refused,  because the invitation was addressed to the Liberal Democratic  Party of Russia. It should have been addressed to me personally  -- to Liberal Democratic Party Chairman Vladimir Zhirinovskiy.  If I were to send him an invitation, I would address it "to  U.S. President Bill Clinton," not to the party that nominated  him.    However, the chance of Clinton and me meeting has not been  lost. My adviser will soon fly to the United States and arrange  this in March or April. We will play golf and go to a ranch.  We will have a rest and get to know each other better. After  the United States I will probably visit Canada, Australia, and  New Zealand.    [Veselinova] What is this "Elipton" weapon?    [Zhirinovskiy] It is my personal weapon. I completely  destroys buildings and people, not by fire, but with a laser  beam that destroys all targets.    [Veselinova] Can you destroy the world with this weapon?    [Zhirinovskiy] Of course I can, but I do not want to. It is  important that we possess such a weapon. If any danger  threatens us, in the case of extreme necessity there is nothing  strange about us using it in certain regions -- for defense.</p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Lautro probes high-income ads Lautro, the self-regulatory organisation for the life assurance industry, yesterday told its members to send in advertising and marketing material for high-income products, so it could investigate whether investors had been misled. Its guidance said that where an investigation confirmed that investors might not have fully understood the product they bought, then companies must take remedial action, which might include sending further information. The move follows advice to members earlier in the week from Fimbra, the self-regulating organisation for financial advisers, and a similar guidance note a few weeks ago from Imro, the regulator for the fund management industry. Fimbra's guidance did not mention the prospect of an inquiry, and the organisation is not calling in marketing material from members. It is, however, expected to take action next week against one of its members. Following an intermediary's distribution of misleading marketing material, Fimbra is likely to insist that a correction and advice to customers about what steps to take are published prominently in the clients' newsletter. Regulators are particularly concerned that misleading comparisons may be drawn with the rates of return from forms of savings such as building society accounts. One of the reasons high-income products have become popular is that investors have looked for ways to replace the income they have lost as interest rates on personal savings have fallen. But some products will not repay capital in full unless conditions - such as stock market growth - are met. The differing and overlapping responses from regulators to this issue will reinforce the argument for the single regulator in this area - the personal investment authority - which is scheduled to start next year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The two main leaders of the Senegalese opposition  have been held in custody since yesterday. Abdoulaye Wade and  Landing Savane were arrested at their homes, and are now being  questioned on their possible involvement in last Wednesday's  violence, which caused the death of six people, including five  policemen in Dakar. The very next day [17 February], Interior  Minister Djibo Ka said that the meeting organized on the same  day by the CFD [expansion unknown], a coalition of opposition  parties, had encouraged violence. Abdoulaye Eliname Kane, the  communications minister and government spokesman, this evening  confirmed this version. Among other things, he told Nicolas  Ballique why the two opposition officials were arrested:    [Begin Kane recording] During the meeting, several speakers,  either directly or by interrupting those who had the floor,  called on the crowd to march on the palace. The organizers did  not discourage them. What we fear is that....[pauses] A  communique says that the organizers understand the  demonstrators' decision to march to the palace.    Given this, I believe that it is the duty of the relevant  authorities to look for a link between these tragic events and  this organization. This movement did not come from nowhere. It  came from the meeting that took place on 16 February on the  Avenue du General de Gaulle. On the route taken by the  demonstrators, several instruments were found. The basic  purpose of these instruments was to kill, to injure, to  massacre. They rule out the thesis of spontaneity. [end  recording]    Abdoulaye Wade's party, the Senegalese Democratic Party, is  suspected of involvement. The movement has reacted and  denounced what it called the continuation of the government's  drift toward authoritarianism. As for the Muslim organization  Aira [as heard], Moustarchidines Wal Moustarchidate, which was  banned by the authorities the day after Wednesday's violence, it  has denied any involvement in the riots.</p>

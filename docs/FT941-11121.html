			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Motoring: Attempts to halt 'jungle' drivers The bare facts are chilling: road accidents are the main cause of accidental death in Britain among all people aged from 15 to 24. One-third of males and one in four females whodie between those ages are highway casualties. Male drivers between 17 and 20 are nine times more likely to be killed, and seven times more likely to have an accident, than middle-aged male drivers. They are also twice as likely as young female drivers to be killed. So, you can see why insurance premiumsfor drivers in their teens and early 20s, especially if they fancy a GTi-type car, have headed for the stratosphere; and why Ford has just pulled the plug on its XR2i and XR3i models, which personify cars the young lust after. Against this background, I give full marks to the BBC and the Department of Transportfor undertaking a safer driving initiative. The first of the six-part Drive series went out on BBC1 last week and 10-minute episodes will be screened every Friday at 8.50pm over the next four weeks. They feature the alternative comedian Alexei Sayle, who pulls motorists up short by exposing bad driving habits. He believes young drivers in particular adopt a jungle approach to driving. 'Here we are . . . late-20th century homo sapiens at the very pinnacle of the evolutionary tree; yet, the second we step on the gas pedal (sic), we become territorial, predatory animals,' he says. Few would quarrel with that; certainly, not I. But is the Drive series really going to put the message across to those road users most in need of it? The series features Sayle, a very funny but far from youthful Liverpudlian, getting into (and out of) motoring scrapes at the wheelof a 26-year-old Rover saloon. What kind of role model is this for 18-year-olds, many of them influenced by articles in go-faster magazines that persistin treating motor-ing as a sporting activity? Is he going to convince them that their attitude toward driving is all wrong and make them eager to become caring, responsible motorists? Or will he be dismissed as a wrinkly with a setof antique wheels who is out of touch with life on the roads in 1994? Iwatched the first episode, missed the second and aim to see the rest. I hope I am wrong and that Sayle's message gets across to those most in need of it. But Iam not optimistic. Would it not be better for a television road safety series directed at young drivers to feature a young hero of the grand prix racingcircuit - 28-year-old Damon Hill, for example? Someone like him could put across to the teens and 20s the difference between competitive driving and normal motoring. In making the point that only immature and exhibitionistic idiotsconfused the two, he might also make some converts and help to save young lives.</p>

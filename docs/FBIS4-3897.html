			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By special reporter Shi Lei (4258 4320): "Democratic </F> Activist Wang Jiaqi Fled to Hong Kong and Is Granted Political  Asylum by the United States"]    [Text] Democratic activist Wang Jiaqi, who has fled from  Mainland China to Hong Kong, will go to the United States in the  near future after a brief stay in Hong Kong. It is said that  the U.S. Government has already approved Wang Jiaqi's request  and granted him political asylum.    An informed source said the department concerned of the Hong  Kong Government had a contact with Wang Jiaqi last week and  asked him to keep a low profile during his stay in Hong Kong.  Wang agreed to do so.    It is said that Wang Jiaqi is now staying on Lamma Island in  Hong Kong, and he is maintaining contact with the outside  through a non-government organization.    The Mainland Chinese government is quite concerned about  possible leakage of secrets due to Wang Jiaqi's flight, and  Mainland Chinese agencies in Hong Kong are busy in detecting  Wang Jiaqi's move.</p>

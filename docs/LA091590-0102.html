			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> William Reedy testified in court in Port Crane, N.Y., that he did not drive the  pickup truck in which Billy Martin was killed last Christmas but lied to  officials to protect Martin, whom he claimed was driving.  </P> <P> The Detroit bar owner, accused of driving while intoxicated during the fatal  wreck that killed Martin, choked back tears when recalling how the five-time  New York Yankee manager did not respond after the crash.  </P> <P> "I said to Billy, 'If you can get up, I'll push you out of the window,' " Reedy  said of the crash's aftermath. "Billy's back was against the wall and his head  slumped forward."  </P> <P> Reedy, a longtime friend of Martin's, testified for 1 1/2 hours.  </P> <P> In previous testimony, an FBI expert said that an analysis of the hair on the  windshield of the truck appeared to show that Reedy was in the driver's seat.  </P> <P> If convicted, Reedy faces a mandatory fine of between $350 and $500, revocation  of his driver's license for at least six months and a possible jail sentence of  up to a year.  </P> <P> S AUTUMOBILE ACCIDENTS -- NEW YORK (STATE)  </P></p>

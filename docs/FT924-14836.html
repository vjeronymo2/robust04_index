			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Blueprint for Hong Kong: China angry at lack of prior agreement CHINA accused Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten of irresponsibility yesterday over his proposals for sweeping democratic changes to the colony in the last years of British rule, a Beijing-controlled news agency reported, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. In its initial response, the China News Service (CNS) quoted a spokesman for the Hong Kong branch of the Xinhua news agency, as saying that any plans for political reform should be discussed with Beijing before being announced. Xinhua is Beijing's de facto embassy in the colony. Beijing is deeply suspicious of political reform in Hong Kong, especially after hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong citizens took to the streets to demonstrate against the 1989 Beijing massacre of student democracy protesters. Earlier, Mr Patten disclosed proposals which would drastically increase the power of Hong Kong people to elect the colony's legislature, the Legislative Council (Legco), at the next elections in 1995. Legislators elected in 1995 will win four-year terms, taking them well past Hong Kong's 1997 handover to China. 'As the 1995 election is related to a smooth transition (to Chinese rule), it should be discussed between both sides and a mutual agreement reached before it is announced,' the spokesman said. China had asked for this to happen but the British side had ignored this request, he said. 'It is very irresponsible and imprudent. The Chinese side will not be responsible for any arguments caused.' It was not clear in Hong Kong last night whether the Xinhau response was China's definitive view, or simply an initial reaction. The Xinhua spokesman said the reforms could breach the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, under which Britain agreed to return Hong Kong to China in 1997. 'If major changes to Hong Kong's political system are made during the transitional period, thus leading to a weakening of the executive-led administration, it is a breach of the Joint Declaration,' the spokesman said. Britain and China have agreed that under Hong Kong's system of limited democracy, the politicalsystem should be executive-led, withthe legislature having only limited powers. China has implacably opposed British efforts to raise the number of directly-elected members and analysts say Mr Patten appears to be trying to boost Hong Kong democracy while still sticking to the letter of Chinese demands.</p>

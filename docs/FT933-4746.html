			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Surprise at Thorn disclosure SURPRISE among leisure analysts over how Thorn EMI chose to deliver what was seen as a subtle profits warning hung over the shares yesterday. The possibility of an official inquiry was under consideration by London Stock Exchange officials last night. Thorn shares had opened sharply down yesterday as SG Warburg, the company's broker, lopped Pounds 18m off its profits forecast. The broker was reacting to a letter sent by Thorn to shareholders on Friday  - and lodged with the Stock Exchange that day - detailing the sale of the group's lighting division. However, at the end of the letter Thorn warns that profits from its security and electronics business are unlikely to be greater than 1992's Pounds 1.5m. Analysts had pencilled in Pounds 15m profits for 1993. But with the exception of Warburg, no other broker seems to have received a copy of the circular until after the market opened yesterday, following which a swathe of downgrades hit the stock. Profits are believed to have been hit by the deferment of certain defence contracts. GEC broke off negotiations a month ago over buying the defence side of Thorn's electronics business. Last night a spokesman for Thorn said: 'I can understand the consternation among some analysts - however, this was not a profits warning but an updated trading statement.' He added that additional information of the bright start made by the music and rental divisions bore this out. He also pointed out that a statement from the Exchange on Friday said the official letter referring to the lighting division was available at the Exchange, and that copies were available from the company or its broker. Thorn shares finished yesterday's session 21 down at 983p. Turnover was a healthy 1.8m.</p>

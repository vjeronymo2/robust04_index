			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> RETAIL SALES BOUNCE BACK  </P> <P> Retail sales generally rebounded in April as consumers returned to stores to  shop for Easter and spring items, several of the nation's biggest retailers  reported today.  </P> <P> Many retailers who had a dismal March posted better results last month.  </P> <P> Woolworth Corp., whose sales plummeted in March compared to a year earlier, had  a 21.1% sales gain in April.  </P> <P> Shoppers again spent most of their money on apparel and lower-priced items  while generally shying away from more expensive purchases. Consumers remained  burdened by high installment debt and were again cautious about major  expenditures.  </P> <P> Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., the nation's largest retailer, reported a 3.1%  increase over April, 1989. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. again outdistanced other  retailers, reporting a 7% increase. J. C. Penney Co. Inc. had a disappointing  month after a much stronger March. Its sales fell 2.8%.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NORTH HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL WIN TURNS TO TRAGEDY  </P> <P> A 17-year-old boy was shot to death at a doughnut shop across from North  Hollywood High School, where more than 100 students had gathered to celebrate  their football team's victory, police said Saturday. The students' elation  Friday night over the Huskies' 31-20 victory against the Monroe High School  Vikings ended in screams and tears when a gang member killed Glen Richard  Avila, said Sgt. John Stilo of the Los Angeles Police Department's North  Hollywood Division.  </P> <P> Police were seeking Louis Arturo Velarde on suspicion of murder, Stilo said.  About 15 minutes after the game ended, the gunman approached Avila in the  parking lot of the Yum Yum Donuts shop, muttered a slogan and shot him in the  chest before running away, Stilo said.  </P></p>

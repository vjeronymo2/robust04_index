			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Bridging the culture gap between west and east - Tackling Asia's tigers / TI Group hopes to gain entry to the Chinese market by forming links in Singapore With sales of Pounds 100m and 2,000 employees in its own or associated companies across the Asia Pacific, TI Group is no stranger to the region. But it recognises the advantages of a helping hand to develop its position still further. In February, it found one in the shape of Sembawang Group, a big Singapore-based industrial conglomerate in which the Singapore government indirectly holds a majority stake. The two companies signed a memorandum of understanding to develop business opportunities together in the region, focusing initially on Singapore and China. As such, the deal represents yet another recent initiative by a UK engineering company to tackle the booming regional market. But by linking with Sembawang, TI is also participating in the regional thrust which the Singapore government is encouraging among local companies. TI's businesses have long been active in the region. The John Crane seals business established its first operations there 27 years ago, and its seven-year-old joint venture in Tianjin is China's largest seals manufacturer. Bundy, which makes automotive tubing and systems, has a number of ventures in the region and both the TI companies are well-known names. The newest addition to the TI fold, Dowty, has the region's only independent service and repair facility capable of handling landing gear from wide-bodied jets. Recently expanded, it is close to Singapore's Changi airport. TI believes the region offers strong growth opportunities for all three of its core businesses, and in recognition of this has created a new full-time post of executive director - Asia Pacific. This kind of post has rapidly become a typical feature of UK engineering companies' approach to the region. The first incumbent, Mr Mark Ellsmore, took up the post in May, to pursue the Sembawang initiative and ensure group resources are allocated to other strategic opportunities in the region. At first glance, the TI-Sembawang group would seem to bring together two very odd bedfellows - a tightly-focused UK specialist engineer and a huge industrial conglomerate with interests ranging from shipbuilding to warehousing. But there are striking similarities in the energetic qualities of the deal's two architects - Sir Christopher Lewinton, TI's chairman, and Mr Philip Yeo, who is chairman both of Singapore's influential Economic Development Board and Sembawang Group. Successful meetings between the two men in London and Singapore clinched the deal. Now the deal is completed, it is up to top executives in the region to make it work. One of them is Mr John Wilson, president of Singapore-based John Crane Asia Pacific. 'We have knowledgeable people here, and all three divisions have exposure to China,' he says. 'But the link-up with Sembawang gives us extra knowledge and a different approach to the market.' 'We are able to draw on a pool of Chinese speakers. And Sembawang are able to take an objective view of our businesses, because they are not experts in them. We bring that expertise.' Singaporeans are very acceptable in all parts of China, he says, not only because they speak Mandarin, but because Singapore is seen as a success achieved by ethnic Chinese people. On top of that, the Chinese business culture is very different from that of Taiwan, Hong Kong or Singapore, he says. Guanxi - the Chinese for relationships, contacts, networking - was important throughout the business world but probably more important in China than any other aspect of doing business, and establishing such relationships was easier between Chinese. Mr Chun Loong Lai, president of Sembawang Industrial, agrees that knowing the culture and the language helps bridge the gap between west and east. 'We have proven that we can convert western technology and management systems into the regional environment, and are able to guide the western company and the receiving party for the technology in the region,' he says. The close working relationship between TI and Sembawang is functioning well, and in its early days is focusing very much on China, as discussions on activity in Singapore are still in an embryonic stage, says Mr Wilson. None of the projects can be identified yet, but the collaboration with Sembawang is aimed at allowing John Crane to expand its operations in China into other industrialised provinces beyond the Tianjin region, while Bundy wants to enter the Chinese automotive market in conjunction with Sembawang. Executives from Bundy and John Crane have visited China together with Sembawang officials, and Mr Wilson envisages more manufacturing of mechanical seals in China, and of automotive tubing systems by Bundy - which needs to manufacture close to its customers so that it can deliver its brake and fuel line systems on a 'just-in-time' basis. In Bundy, says Mr Lai, 'TI has one of the top names in tubing, and the automotive industry in China is growing. It makes sense to examine the business, bring the parties together, and participate with them in going into China.' Both sides stress that the agreement does not limit them to China and Singapore, and Dowty could become part of the deal at some time in the future, says Mr Wilson. But neither TI nor Sembawang has unlimited resources, and a focused approach to a manageable number of projects, rather than a large number of shallow collaborations on a broad front, is important and necessary, he says. 'We've picked a handful of projects where we believe we can be winners, he says. Once we've got a couple of successes under our belts, who knows where it will go?' Mr Lai suggests one result of the collaboration could be a TI design centre in Singapore, which would attract Singapore tax incentives. Mr Wilson believes both John Crane and Bundy are ahead of their competitors in exploiting the Chinese market. 'There are no other international mechanical seal companies with substantial joint ventures in China,' he says. 'It was a somewhat enlightened view in 1987 by TI to go into the venture, which had taken four years to negotiate.' Bundy's competitors in China are mainly Japanese companies, which are 'sniffing around,' says Mr Wilson. But in a customer-led business Bundy has a strategic advantage as most of the foreign car manufacturers in China are European or US, which know Bundy well. With Sembawang, Bundy has visited Volkswagen, Citroen and Peugeot plants in China, says Mr Lai, and more visits were planned. Even with this strong position, the deal with Sembawang would enable TI to move its plans forward faster and more effectively, particularly in China, says Mr Wilson. In any case, though, he believes both TI divisions can achieve growth in the region significantly ahead of average GNP growth of 7 per cent. 'A number of developing markets are moving from lower to higher technology, which is good for our products,' he says. In seals, environmental issues and the need for greater efficiency and consistency in process industries makes mechanical seals increasingly preferable to the cheaper packings, while Bundy has not only the lure of serving the region's automotive industries but, subsequently, the prospects of supplying tubing to the region's refrigerator industry. Economic growth suggests this will grow rapidly - after a TV, a refrigerator is the next thing that gets bought by households as living standards rise, says Mr Wilson.

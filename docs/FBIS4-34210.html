			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 15 Jun (EFE) -- More  than six of Cuban President Fidel Castro's bodyguards had to  cram into a station wagon today to flee a group of reporters,  who were seeking an explanation as to why the bodyguards had  earlier attacked several cameramen.    Reporters and bodyguards exchanged strong insults and even a  few blows while the Cubans' station wagon quickly pulled away  amid jeers from the reporters. The reporters had tried to film  and interview the bodyguards after they attacked a group of  cameramen who tried to talk with Castro at the entrance of the  Hilton Hotel in Cartagena, where guests attending the Fourth  Ibero-Ameican Summit are lodged.    The incident started when Nicaraguan President Violeta  Chamorro stopped to make statements at the foot of the stairs,  which were being descended by the heads of state who had just  held a number of bilateral meetings before the second session of  the summit. At that moment, one of the television reporters  brought a microphone close to Castro, who was waiting behind  Chamorro, but Castro's bodyguards reacted violently, and,  according to eyewitnesses, a fracas ensued, first with an  exchange of insults, then blows.    From amid a maelstrom of Cuban security agents and  reporters,  one Argentine cameraman shouted in anguish: "You must not hit  reporters. You must not hit reporters." The incident took place  in front of several astonished and concerned presidents, foreign  ministers, and Colombian officials.    When the situation calmed down and the presidents left for  the Cartagena Convention Center, the reporters went looking for  the bodyguards and chased them down -- cameras and microphones  in hand -- in the vicinity of the Hilton. Finally the group of  bodyguards, some of whom were accused of having caused similar  incidents at previous summits, hastily got into a station wagon  amid shouts of "This is not Cuba; reporters are respected here."    Reporters covering the Ibero-American Summit have  encountered  difficulties because of security measures that have been  described as excessive. On Tuesday, they complained to the  Colombian authorities who, nevertheless, refused to modify the  strict rules concerning access to the leaders.</p>

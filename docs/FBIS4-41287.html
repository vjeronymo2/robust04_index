			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Mart Laar, commenting today on  Russian President Boris Yeltsin's decree of 21 June on Russia  unilaterally demarcating the Estonian-Russian state border, said  that this is an unprecedented case internationally. According  to the prime minister, it is particularly regrettable that this  step was taken at a time when talks between Estonian and Russian  representatives are in progress. Laar thinks that this is  probably a case of Russia putting pressure on Estonia in order  to achieve concessions with regard to resolving the issue of  Russian military pensioners who live here.    At the same time, Laar stated that Estonia will firmly  retain  her position and continue to call for the Russian troop  withdrawal by 31 August of this year. Estonia will definitely  approach international organizations in order to resolve the  conflict that has resulted from this strained situation, Laar  emphasized.</p>

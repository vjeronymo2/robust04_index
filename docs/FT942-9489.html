			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Bentsen gives assurance on dollar Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, said yesterday the feeling that Washington was content to see the dollar drop in value was a 'misrepresentation,' Reuter reports from New York. 'There was a misinterpretation that we wanted to see the dollar go down,' Mr Bentsen told CBS television. He said the Clinton administration 'saw no value in undervaluing the dollar'. While Mr Bentsen did not say outright that the administration opposed an increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, he said it should be determined 'by the market and underlying economic factors'. He said that he felt short-term interest rates would be up one-half point by the end of the year to 4 per cent. Referring to the Federal Reserve's two recent quarter-point rate increases, Mr Bentsen said: 'It seems we have reached a point where no good (economic) numbers go unpunished.' On Friday, Mr Bentsen said he shared the Federal Reserve Board's goal of promoting low-inflationary economic growth. 'Let me just say that Alan Greenspan (chairman of the Federal Reserve) and I share the goal of steady, well grounded, low inflationary growth,' Mr Bentsen told the Business Council, a meeting of top business executives. 'I think that's what we have and the Fed is just being cautious to make certain it stays that way,' he added. Financial markets have been on edge anticipating more interest rate rises by the US central bank. Mr Bentsen acknowledged that long-term interest rates have moved up in the past few months. 'But it's worth noting that what's behind rates is growth,' he said.</p>

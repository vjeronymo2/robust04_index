			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NUCLEAR ACCIDENT RISK FROM SHUTTLE SATELLITE PLANT IS SMALL, NASA SAYS  </P> <P> NASA officials said Friday the risk of a nuclear accident will be only slight  when it launches an interplanetary satellite containing a plutonium power plant  later this year from the space shuttle Atlantis.  </P> <P> In an environmental impact statement required by law, the space agency said  health and environmental consequences of the "most probable" of accidents -- a  1-in-10 million chance -- would be small.  </P> <P> The inch-thick document was released by the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration and an abstract was to be published in the Federal Register.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 50 Pounds of Plutonium  </P> <P> The electric generator, holding nearly 50 pounds of plutonium oxide, will be  aboard the Galileo spacecraft scheduled for launch from the shuttle in October  for a two-year study of Jupiter.  </P> <P> According to one estimate, if that amount of plutonium were released into the  atmosphere it would have about 10 times the radioactivity of the Soviet spy  satellite that crashed into Canada in 1978. Plutonium is used in nuclear  weapons as well as nuclear reactors.  </P> <P> The environmental impact statement calls for public comment over the succeeding  45 days before a final statement is issued.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Very Small Health Risks'  </P> <P> "An intensive analysis of the proposed action indicates that the possible  health and environmental consequences of launch or mission anomalies pose small  risks," the statement says. "The accident estimated to be the most probable  would pose very small health risks and very small probability of environmental  contamination."  </P> <P> A nuclear generator has not been carried aboard a space shuttle before,  although the devices have been used on space probes and manned flights to the  moon.  </P> <P> On the Galileo mission, the generator would be used to provide electricity to  the space probe. The satellite does not have solar panels because it will  travel too distant from the sun to draw energy.  </P></p>

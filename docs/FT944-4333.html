			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures had another volatile day, with early gains eradicated in later trading as Wall Street opened lower, writes Jeffrey Brown. The FT-SE 100 December contract stood at 3,007 at the close of pit trading, down 15 points for a two-day decline of 34 points, wiping out nearly the whole of Monday's strong rise. At the official 4.10pm close there was a discount to the cash market of almost five points. For fair value the December contract needs to stand at a two-point premium. Trading was again average at best, with 17,453 lots traded, but within this total more than 5,000 were spread trading as investors rolled over into the March contract. The session started strongly, with a steady premium to the cash market building to around five points. But there was never any real attempt to lead cash equities upwards and when Wall Street opened the mood turned sour. The premium to cash equities was quickly replaced by a discount, and having touched a day's best of 3,047 during the morning, December was down to 3,002 at one time just before pit trading ended. Traded option volume was also slow, falling from Tuesday's 43,188 lots to 33,407. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE business was some 22,000 lots. National Power was the most active stock option, with 973 contracts dealt.</p>

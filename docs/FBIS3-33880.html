Chavan, has said that  Pakistan has no moral right to raise the issue of alleged human  rights violations in Kashmir, because Islamabad is mainly  responsible for creating the present problem in the valley.  Addressing a news conference in Jammu this afternoon, he said  the recent call by Pakistan for a general strike is another  proof of its support to the militants. The home minister said  that Pakistan totally forgets that the worst kind of human  rights violations have been perpetrated by its forces in its own  province of Sindh and other areas. Mr. Chavan said that steps  have been taken to counter the Pakistani disinformation campaign  on the issue. Nonofficial organizations from India will be  visiting different countries to put the record straight, he  said. The home minister said that the Army has ordered an  inquiry into the recent incident at Kupwara. Its findings will  be made public. Replying to questions, Mr. Chavan said the  government does not propose to appoint political advisers in  Jammu and Kashmir. He said elections will be held in the state  at an appropriate time. Government is prepared to hold  negotiations with any group in the valley which is willing to  discuss the matter within the framework of the constitution and  is prepared to give up violence. Mr. Chavan said he has had  discussions with different political parties separately adding  that he may call a joint meeting of all parties on this issue.    The home minister today completed a three-day tour of Jammu,  Doda, Kishtwar. During his visit, he met a large number of  people and leaders of political parties. He said the people  have appreciated the induction of additional security forces in  the area where some foreign mercenaries have also become active.  Mr. Chavan also reviewed during his tour the financial problems  of Jammu and Kashmir at meetings with the state governor and  senior officials.</p>

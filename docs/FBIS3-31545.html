			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ante Gugo: "Solution Even Without Pale"] </F>   [Text] The Saturday meeting in Frankfurt of Croatian  Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Dr. Mate Granic with  Haris Silajdzic, prime minister of the government of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Muslims, could, in the future, be interpreted  as an event that marked the turning point in the war on the  territory of former Yugoslavia. In brief, it is evident from  the statements given by Ganic and Silajdzic that, for the time  being, the two still-warring sides have drawn closer. Analyzing  the factors that lead to such a turnabout, one should, among  other things, examine a visit of Clinton's envoy Charles Redman  to Zagreb, which lasted several days. If we view Clinton's  address to the nation within this context, it becomes clear that  the United States has assumed, without the possibility of a  deferment, responsibility for bringing this war crisis to an  end. One could also examine the influence of Zhirinovskiy and  some other factors here, however, for the time being, the  relation between the Croats and the Muslims is the most  important, as it will ultimately determine the situation that  will prevail from the Alps to the Ionian Sea.    None of the statesmen wishes to say a word about Redman's  initiative. However, by analyzing the statements of Granic and  Silajdzic in Frankfurt, it will not be difficult to grasp the  contents of this possible solution. Dr. Granic reiterated  Croatia's stand on the need for cooperation with the Muslims and  on the possible cooperation of the future states, which has  already been contained in President Tudjman's peace initiative.  Dr. Silajdzic did not repeat his previous stand. On this  occasion he spoke in favor of something entirely new, from which  it can be concluded that the alliance of the two peoples in  Bosnia-Herzegovina is possible. The Bosnia-Herzegovina prime  minister said that there are still differences regarding the  nuances of the internal constitution, but that this can be  overcome and that the model of relations between  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia should be discussed afterward. As  opposed to earlier views that nothing can be solved without the  Serbs, even though it was Izetbegovic who was saying it most  frequently, on this occasion, the Muslim side put forward a  proposal that the doors be left open to the Serbs for this type  of regulation of internal relations. Therefore, one can  conclude that it will be a Serbian problem whether they accept  it or not. The Muslims, so it seems, are willing to enter a  joint state without the Serbs.    This was all agreed in the presence of U.S. envoy Redman and  the leading people from the European Union. The only question  remaining now is what kind of a state will this be without the  Serbs who are situated in the west of Bosnia-Herzegovina?  Bearing in mind that this is evidently an U.S. initiative,  which has also produced threats of air strikes, the possibility  that they could carry out this threat should be borne in mind.  It means that Clinton's preparation of the nation for military  engagement does not mean preparation for the liberation of  Sarajevo, but has much wider dimensions. The Serbs will perhaps  want to leave Bosnia-Herzegovina, but it might prove awfully  expensive for them. On the other hand, if the world returns to  the old and realistic geo-strategic divisions, the Croats and  the Muslims could prosper well together. The precondition for  this is the safeguarding of human rights for both peoples on the  principle of reciprocity and with the supervision and guarantees  of the international community.    The Russians, as a very interested side, have realized too  late what is happening. Sending 400 of their soldiers to  Sarajevo will not bring some great change in the present U.S.  plans. The leap westward of the traditional geo-strategic  positions would be a gain for Yeltsin and the generals who  should be placated. However, if nothing, or less than expected,  materializes out of this, and if at the same time the failure is  paid for in cash for the restoration of the economy, the  Russians could be very satisfied. For that reason, the fact  that European Union representatives were also present at the  talks in Frankfurt beside the United State is also encouraging.</p>

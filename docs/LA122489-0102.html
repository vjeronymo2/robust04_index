			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BATTLING SQUATTERS TAKES TIME, ENERGY  </P> <P> It is an hour before dark and the action at the corner of South LaSalle Avenue  and 27th Street, just west of the USC campus, is just heating up.  </P> <P> Several shabbily dressed men and two thin-legged women are standing in front of  a boarded-up, two-story fourplex, using hand signals to direct a steady stream  of foot traffic.  </P> <P> "What ya need?" one of the women asks a man who walks up just as Kerman Maddox,  president of the LaSalle/Adams Block Club passes by with a visitor. The  customer's answer is lost in the wind, but the man rushes inside the derelict  building with the woman trotting behind.  </P> <P> During the next hour, a reporter watches as more than a dozen people either  drive or walk up to the corner and enter the fourplex and leave minutes later.  </P> <P> "And this is a quiet day," Maddox said wearily.  </P> <P> He then recounted the days when drug trafficking is so heavy that it is  difficult to pass through the clusters of people blocking the sidewalk, or  worse, days when drug deals go bad and gunfire erupts.  </P> <P> For a year, Maddox and other members of his group have been battling to rid  their normally quiet four blocks of neatly kept wood-frame houses of what they  refer to as "the 24-hour drug supermarket," a vacant building that has been  taken over by squatters who deal crack cocaine inside.  </P> <P> The block club's battle illustrates how much energy -- and patience -- it takes  for even a well-organized group of homeowners to rid their area of a problem  property, even when they have the support of police and government agencies.  </P> <P> Many property owners caught in the middle of the city's crack cocaine plague  complain about the high cost of evicting squatters and repairing the damage  they have caused.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Police Department's South Bureau, at the request of the block  club, has officially identified the boarded-up fourplex in the 2600 block of  South LaSalle as a crack house in need of special attention or "abatement."  </P> <P> The building has been the subject of numerous police raids, narcotics arrests  and scores of neighborhood complaints, said Officer Robie McIntosh of the South  Bureau Abatement Unit. The special four-man team is assigned solely to pressure  landlords into cleaning up their properties and evicting drug-dealing tenants.  </P> <P> Scores of people who live near the LaSalle property have signed declarations  that police hope to use in a court case to force the owner to rid the building  of drug dealers or face stiff fines.  </P> <P> According to Maddox, the building is a blight on the neighborhood. Gang  graffiti have been spray-painted on sidewalks and nearby buildings, and a rash  of car thefts and burglaries have occurred. After someone fire-bombed the  building in September, some -- but not all -- of the drug trade moved across  the street, he said.  </P> <P> The owner of the fourplex, Norma Jones Harvey of Los Angeles, said the fire was  the last in a long series of setbacks that have kept her from rehabilitating  the property she inherited when her mother died last year. The building had  been vacant and trouble free for years, Harvey said, until her mother in 1987  rented to a man whose wife and daughter were addicted to crack.  </P> <P> Harvey, who said she was out of work most of last year and now survives on a  clerical worker's salary, said that as a result of complaints from Maddox and  his neighbors, and at the suggestion of the police, she evicted all the  tenants, boarded up the building and hired an on-site caretaker. If drugs are  dealt from the building now, she said, she knows nothing of it and it is not  her responsibility.  </P> <P> "I've been within the law," Harvey said tearfully. "If someone is in there,  they have no business being there. I can't go over there and make them leave,  and the caretaker doesn't have a gun."  </P> <P> Harvey said she cannot go to check on her property during the week because she  works and would not be caught there at night.  </P> <P> "The people who live on the block who knew my mother have begged me not to come  there after dark," she said. "They said I might get my head blown off."  </P></p>

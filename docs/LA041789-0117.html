			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHASTISES TEAMMATES;  </P> <P> STRAWBERRY LETS METS KNOW HE'S NOT HAPPY  </P> <P> In case the New York Mets did not quite get the message from Davey Johnson's  postgame meeting Sunday following their 5-3 loss to the Cardinals, Darryl  Strawberry made it as unmistakable and emphatic as the two home runs he ripped  in the game. Strawberry followed Johnson's outburst with a coarsely worded  session with reporters in which he charged that his teammates are not taking  their jobs seriously.  </P> <P> "A lot of guys here act like we're in Little League," Strawberry said. "Just  because we won last year can't help us this year. Some guys have got to start  sacrificing. We're here to play ball, not play cards and golf. . . . You can  play cards and all the golf you want in the winter. Maybe that's fine for  relaxing, but when you're a last-place team, you should be thinking about  getting the job done on the field."  </P> <P> Johnson and Strawberry exploded after the Mets had sunk to last place and five  games out seemingly without any concern. The team is hitting .223, but when the  Mets had an off day in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, nobody showed for extra  hitting. Instead, several players hit the golf course, just as they had done  after a short workout Monday. Many of them played as many as 45 holes.  </P> <P> And their clubhouse before each game has the look of a back room to a poker  hall, with games of casino, hearts and solitaire to be found for all. Fully  one-third of the team are regular card players.  </P> <P> "He (Johnson) has got a right to be (ticked) off," Strawberry said. "We didn't  play well in spring training. Some guys didn't take spring training seriously.  They took it as a joke. The same thing . . . is happening in the regular  season. It's no joke.  </P> <P> "It's time to do something. . . . How embarrassed do you feel to be in last  place after being National League East champs a year ago?  </P> <P> "It's just a matter of how we approach the game. We feel intimidated. Guys feel  like they can't get a hit. That's what it seems like. We should have won the  last two games.  </P> <P> "It's kind of like everybody's looking for me to do it all the time. Other guys  have got to come through."  </P> <P> Strawberry has hit three home runs in the past two games and is batting .282.  He does not play cards or golf.  </P></p>

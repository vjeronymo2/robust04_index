			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Washington tries to allay Gatt fears AGREEMENT in the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation is more likely following meetings this week in Brussels, according to Mr Rufus Yerxa, US ambassador to the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. His comments came during a response to fears voiced in the Gatt's latest review of US trade policy that Washington was retreating from its commitment to liberal world trade. The Gatt review argued that US efforts to seal preferential regional trade arrangements - such as with Mexico in the North American Free Trade Agreement - could lead to 'the erosion of basic Gatt principles by regionalism, bilateralism, unilateralism or various forms of managed trade'. Mr Yerxa disputed that the US drive for regional trade accords weakened its commitment to the multilateral trading system. Regional economic integration would benefit the western hemisphere and lead to a more open trade environment worldwide, he said. On the US-EC farm trade negotiations, which have for so long stalled progress towards a Uruguay Round trade accord, Mr Yerxa said fresh proposals from US president George Bush, presented in Brussels this week to Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, were 'a good faith effort on our part' to give the EC new ideas for resolving differences. Mr Delors was to reply yesterday to Mr Bush's letter, but its contents have not been revealed. EC officials were meanwhile trying to dampen hopes of a breakthrough. Trading partners' criticisms of the US during the Gatt review included US anti-dumping and countervailing duty actions, the automatic Dollars 1bn (Pounds 585m) boost to farm export subsidies under the 1990 Farm Act if there is no Uruguay Round accord by June 1992, and bilateral and managed trade deals.

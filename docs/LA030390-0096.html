			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH COURT TO REVIEW LEGALITY OF TAX INITIATIVE  </P> <P> In a far-reaching test of the voters' power to raise taxes, the state Supreme  Court has agreed to review the constitutionality of Proposition 99, the  landmark tobacco tax initiative passed in 1988.  </P> <P> The justices said they will hear an appeal by a Glendale tobacco distributing  and wholesaling firm that contends that the measure violates provisions of  Proposition 13 prohibiting "any" new state tax without approval of two-thirds  of both houses of the Legislature.  </P> <P> The high court, in a brief order filed Thursday and signed by all six  participating justices, said it will review a ruling last December by a state  Court of Appeal upholding the legality of the initiative.  </P> <P> The justices did not set a date for a hearing, but they are expected to resolve  the issue quickly because of the hundreds of millions of dollars in annual  revenues at stake and the broad implications of the case for future attempts to  raise taxes by statutory initiative. For example, backers of the  "nickel-a-drink" increased tax on alcoholic beverages hope to place their  initiative on the November ballot.  </P> <P> Proposition 99, approved by 58% of the electorate, imposed on wholesalers and  distributors a 25-cents-a-pack tax increase on cigarettes and tax hikes on  other tobacco products. The initiative, in an era of scarce revenues, is  expected to generate about $600 million a year for state health, educational  and environmental programs.  </P> <P> Lawyers for the tobacco firm in the case, Kennedy Wholesale Inc., argue that  the voters lack authority to enact a statutory tax increase in the face of  constitutional limits on new taxes imposed under Proposition 13, the 1978  property tax-reduction initiative.  </P> <P> Company attorneys also claim that the tobacco tax measure, by providing funds  for some programs they say are not really related to smoking, violates  constitutional provisions limiting initiatives to a "single subject."  </P> <P> State lawyers respond that Proposition 13's restrictions were intended only to  limit the Legislature's taxing powers and not to intrude on the long-held  initiative powers of the voters. All of the tobacco measure's provisions are  reasonably related to countering the wide-ranging problems resulting from  smoking -- and thus do not violate the "single-subject" rule, the state says.  </P> <P> State Deputy Atty. Gen. Floyd D. Shimomura refused Friday to view the high  court's action as a signal that it disagrees with the appeals court ruling  upholding the initiative.  </P> <P> "We feel fairly confident that the Supreme Court is going to uphold the tobacco  tax and the people's right to increase revenues through the initiative  process," he said.  </P> <P> Shimomura said also that even if the initiative is invalidated, it was not  assured that all tobacco distributors would be entitled to refunds of taxes  already paid. Unlike Kennedy Wholesale Inc., most such firms did not file  protests when they paid their taxes, and thus might not be eligible for any  refunds, he said.  </P> <P> Carolyn B. Kuhl of Los Angeles, an attorney representing the Kennedy firm,  declined comment on the case.  </P> <P> The initiative took effect on Jan. 1, 1989, and two days later, Kennedy paid an  increased tax of $50,510.49, and simultaneously filed for a refund with the  State Board of Equalization. The board denied the request and the firm filed  suit.  </P> <P> The Court of Appeal, in its ruling Dec. 14, held that Proposition 13 was not  intended to repeal the voters' right to enact statewide tax increases by  statutory initiative.  </P> <P> "If the people had wanted to abrogate their right of statutory initiative in  this area or to impose upon themselves a (two-thirds) majority requirement, we  are confident that they would have expressly done so," Appellate Justice Rodney  Davis wrote in an opinion joined by Justices Robert K. Puglia and Frances  Newell Carr. "The enactment of the tobacco initiative was well within the power  of the electorate."  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> TWO PERFECT 'PARENTS,' DESPITE THE SCRIPT  </P> <P> In "Parents" (citywide) -- Randy Quaid and Mary Beth Hurt make a perfect pair  of all-American '50s gargoyles: the suburban mom and dad from hell.  </P> <P> They play Nick and Lily Laemle, two Indiana suburbanites whose distraught tot,  Michael (Bryan Madorsky), watches the murderously sunny facade of his home life  crumble into bloody madness. The movie crumbles too, into narrative anemia. But  the surreally ordinary Quaid and Hurt help keep the facade sunny and murderous,  chirpy and loathsome.  </P> <P> They also keep the lawns clipped, the kitchen sparkling, the dining table  bounteously heaped with mysterious leftovers. Everything is shiny, shiny . . .  except at night, when Michael hears sinister chompings and gurglings.  </P> <P> What goes on in the dark? Quaid, immaculately dull, waggling a golf club, has  the supercilious smirk of a secretly naughty football coach, the menacingly  modulated charm of "Leave It to Beaver's" Ward with a bloody cleaver. Hurt  looks a bit like a Celeste Holm-Betty White clone on perky pills. She has stiff  skirts that flounce and bounce and the stiffer white smiles of a Frigidaire  saleswoman with a body in the freezer.  </P> <P> You don't really need the collection of '50s oldies on the sound track, from  "Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White" to "Moments to Remember," to set the  period. These two actors, plus art director Andris Hausmanis and costume  designer Arthur Rowsell, nail the '50s to the wall immediately.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, screenwriter Christopher Hawthorne hasn't nailed down anything.  He's just flung another high-concept dart into space, one more marketing hook  in search of a movie. The concept has promise. These evilly immaculate parents  are symbols of the greed and immorality that can lurk beneath a middle-class  facade, the cancer cells of the Eisenhower era, the rot beneath the frozen  smile. There's also the shaggy corpse of a psychological drama about troubled  childhoods buried in here somewhere.  </P> <P> The script makes sense only on its own symbolic level; strip away the symbols  and the story becomes scatterbrained. Why hasn't Michael suspected his parents  before? Why are they so careless now? Why does the consummate opportunist Nick  forbid his son to play with the daughter of his boss? Why does Sandy Dennis'  nosy, blowzy social worker march into the Laemle's home and go prowling around  upstairs and down? Why is Michael so careless with a telltale stolen  instrument?  </P> <P> First-time director Bob Balaban gives "Parents" an attractively flashy surface  and voluptuously askew camera angles; it was Balaban who dreamed up the idea of  setting it in the late '50s. But "Parents" looks like the work of bright,  well-intentioned people who've seen a lot of vacuous, predictable horror movies  and become convinced that they could make a vacuous, predictable horror movie,  too -- with a sociological point.  </P> <P> Unhappily enough, they've succeeded . . . completely. Those who prefer their  sociological points without vacuous horror movies attached, may walk out  famished. "Parents" (MPAA rated R for mature theme and violence) is all  leftovers, despite the tasty little tidbits that Quaid and Hurt keep  sporadically cooking up: Dad's spotless collars and loopy grin, Mom's brittle  Cutex-lacquered claws.  </P> <P> 'PARENTS'  </P> <P> A Vestron Pictures/Great American Film Limited partnership presentation.

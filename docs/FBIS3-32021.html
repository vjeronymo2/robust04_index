In a news release issued 26 January,  Senator Ebrane Cadet reminds Robert Malval and the members of  the resigning government that they must limit themselves to  dealing with day-to-day matters.    The legislator, a member of the Alliance for Parliamentary  Cohesion, accuses the government of continuing to compromise  national sovereignty. Sen. Cadet quotes the letter from Colin  Granderson, seeking logistic measures in view of the return of  about 30 UN/OAS observers to the country.</p>

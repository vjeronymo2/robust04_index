			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Seppo Saastamoinen report: "Kaariainen Seeks New Trading </F> Rules"]    [Text] Trade and Industry Minister Seppo Kaariainen  (Center) is leaving today for Moscow for a meeting of the  chairmen of the Finnish-Russian Commission of Economic  Cooperation. His main objective will be to clear up the rules  for trading between Russia and Finland. Kaariainen thinks that  the rules need to be revised with regard to fiscal issues,  including the recent unexpected road-toll problems. "We hope,  of course, that the Russians will come up with solutions to  these problems as quickly as possible, and I have no reason to  doubt their goodwill in this respect. But we also have to be  realistic with regard to the timetable," Kaariainen said.    Kaariainen will carry out an initial review of his  objectives  with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Economic Relations  Minister Oleg Davydov, Kaariainen's opposite number as head of  the Russian delegation to the economic commission, while  Kaariainen leads the Finnish one. Today's meeting between the  two chairmen will be brief and formal, but it has been long  expected. The work of the economic commission has been at a  standstill for more than a year due to the inability of the  Russians to appoint a chairman for their delegation. Following  Davidov's appointment to the chairmanship it is now believed  that the economic commission will be able to resume its work.  One of the objectives of the meeting between the chairmen will  be to prepare the commission's next session.    "The most essential thing, of course, is that the two  chairmen of the commission are now able to meet after a long  pause. This shows that there is a will on the part of the  politicians and authorities in both countries to stimulate the  expanding trade," Kaariainen added. Kaariainen's positive  expectations are also understandable considering that today's  meeting can be held in spite of Davidov's various other  commitments. It was still uncertain on Monday [25 April]  morning whether Davidov would be home in time for Thursday after  his long foreign tour.    The official agenda of the chairmens' meeting includes  topics  such as financing trade and transportation plus the specific  company projects discussed during Russian Prime Minister  Chernomyrdin's trip to Finland in March. "I am now going to  review progress on these specific issues," Kaariainen said. The  topics discussed during Chernomyrdin's visit included projects  put forward by Metra, Outokumpu, and Rautaruukki.    Kaariainen's visit to Moscow will not, however, involve  anybody from these or any other enterprises. TT [expansion  unknown] President Georg Ehrnroth will perform the function of  joint chairman representing these companies. The chairmen are  also expected to fix a date for the commission's next meeting,  to be held in Helsinki. Kaariainen thinks that it may take place  before midsummer.</p>

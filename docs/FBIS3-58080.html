			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Netherlands Works on Treaty for </F> Return of Group of Vietnamese"]    [Text] The Hague -- The Netherlands Government is hoping to  sign shortly a treaty with Vietnam on the return of 300  Vietnamese asylum-seekers. In return for economic support from  the Netherlands, the Vietnam authorities would guarantee that  their fellow countrymen were not persecuted following their  return.    Foreign Minister Kooijmans and State Secretary of Justice  Kosto hope to send the details of the agreement to Parliament  next week for its assessment. "The talks with the Hanoi  government are ongoing, but we hope to conclude them," the  Foreign Ministry said.    Two years ago the question of the Vietnamese asylum-seekers,  who ultimately were refused asylum, led to great commotion when  the group went on a hunger strike to protest against approaching  extradition. The group was afraid of persecution in Vietnam,  because they had traveled from Czechoslovakia to the Netherlands  without the Vietnamese authorities' permission.    According to Inlia, the church group which took care of  them,  some 300 of the original group of 350 are still in the  Netherlands. Most of them have found shelter in low-rent  accommodations in various villages, Inlia said. The other 50  have probably traveled to other European countries.    Refugee Work [a refugee support group] said that the new  treaty should offer straight guarantees that nothing would  happen to the asylum-seekers when they returned to their own  country. If Vietnam gave that guarantee, the Netherlands  Government should demand effective local monitoring to ensure  that the promise was respected.    The treaty should also offer a solution for Vietnamese  asylum-seekers who were sent back against their will, Refugee  Work said.    Germany and Vietnam have already made an agreement on the  return of asylum-seekers in return for economic support.  However, in Hanoi, Vietnamese people who return from Germany  involuntarily have been put back on the plane to Germany.    The talks on the Netherlands-Vietnamese treaty, which have  been dragging on for two years, have been made possible by the  improved economic and diplomatic relations between the two  countries.    At the end of last year, a trade delegation led by State  Secretary Van Rooy visited Vietnam. A few weeks ago the  Netherlands Embassy in Hanoi reopened.</p>

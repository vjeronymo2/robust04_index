			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Consumer borrowing remains buoyant CONSUMER borrowing remained buoyant last month, pointing to a gradual recovery in confidence and reflecting the rise in retail sales. Official credit business figures showed that consumers borrowed a net Pounds 118m in May. This was below the levels of the two previous months which - at more than Pounds 190m in both March and April - were the highest for nearly two years. In spite of the slowdown, May was the eighth consecutive month that consumers borrowed more than they paid back. The increase in borrowing was generated by finance houses, which lent a net Pounds 180m to consumers in May. This was offset by net repayments of Pounds 56m on credit card loans, and Pounds 6m on unsecured building society loans. New credit advanced to consumers fell in May to Pounds 4.2bn, down from Pounds 4.4bn in April. The Central Statistical Office said this mainly reflected lower advances on credit cards. Although the figures account for only about 15 per cent of private-sector debt - mortgages are not included - they provide a useful snapshot of the state of consumer activity. The CSO said net lending had been rising since about August last year. This suggests that consumers are not as cautious about accumulating debt as they were in the recession, but monthly figures have yet to reach levels that were common at the end of the 1980s. In the three months to the end of May net lending to consumers rose to Pounds 508m from Pounds 341m in the previous three month period. Confidence about UK exports has slipped slightly in the latest quarter according to a survey of directors carried out by Gallup for DHL, the freight company. The survey showed that exporters are less optimistic than three months ago but 47 per cent have high expectations for orders in the next three months. Orders will be good or excellent in the coming year, 62 per cent believe.</p>

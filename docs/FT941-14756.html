			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Scottish industry in upbeat mood The mood of businesses in Scotland is continuing to improve as the Scottish economy emerges gently from recession, says the latest quarterly Scottish Chambers Business Survey. The manufacturing and wholesale sectors reported the fastest rises in demand in the last quarter of 1993 compared with the previous one. The construction industry also showed increased optimism, while retailing and tourism were more cautious about prospects. Orders taken by manufacturing companies rose, especially from the domestic market, a further sign that the Scottish economy is improving. Scotland suffered far less than southern England in the recession. Unemployment, now 9.2 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis, fell below the UK average two years ago for the first time since records began in the 1920s. It remained lower last year. The survey, which is analysed by the Fraser of Allander Institute of Strathclyde University, the economic forecasting body, showed investment by manufacturers in plant and machinery continuing to rise. Employment fell in most sectors in the fourth quarter of 1993 and recruitment also dropped, though this is normal for the time of year. There was even evidence that companies had difficulty recruiting labour in some sectors, and little sign of them increasing their training provisions. The downward trend in employment in the financial sector, which has been consistent over the past three years, became steeper in the last three months of 1993. The decline in employment affected full-time staff much more severely than part-time or temporary staff, the Fraser of Allander Institute said.</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Property groups worth over Pounds 1bn seek listings Several private property companies are in discussions for a Stock Exchange listing in the new year with a potential total market value of about Pounds 1bn. The moves are being fuelled by investor enthusiasm for the property market, the slow recovery of which earlier this year has accelerated rapidly in recent months. Expected to lead the way is Pillar Properties, the former fund management vehicle which has property investments totalling some Pounds 200m. Analysts said a further Pounds 100m is likely to be added before flotation. Argent Group is also said to be taking soundings from stockbrokers and advisers. It has substantial investments totalling Pounds 230m in central Birmingham and elsewhere. Several other smaller companies are said to be in discussions. Growing direct institutional investment in selected properties has been matched by investor appetite for listed property companies. Many shares have reached, and in some cases passed, their pre-recession highs. Mr Elliott Bernerd, chairman of Chelsfield, the property company which is seeking a listing, said investor enthusiasm for property issues remained strong. 'In all our presentations prior to the offer, the attitude of investors was extremely enthusiastic.' However, with banks remaining cautious over lending on other than the most prestigious and secure developments, private funds for the property market remain limited. 'The only way forward for the medium-sized private company is to float,' said one analyst. Mr John Slade at Richard Ellis, the property agent, said: 'They are positioning themselves for the next boom, and now is the ideal time. It is the only way they will get bigger.' As the market has recovered, the listed companies have taken advantage by raising extra funds through rights issues. More than Pounds 1.5bn has been tapped from shareholders this year. 'Private companies being denied this facility have not had the same flexibility of investment.' Mr Peter Freeman, chief executive of Argent, said: 'The banks have been quite willing to borrow on properties with long leases, strong rental stream and blue chip tenants, but beyond that they are still relatively unreceptive.' He added that if a property company wanted to go outside that remit and consider developing, other sources of finance had to be considered. Demand for the well-let central London office block remained strong, with institutions particularly keen to use it as an alternative investment to bonds. Shopping centres, as well as small prime shop units offering good yields were also being targeted. Mr Brian Jollee, managing director of Capital and Counties, the property arm of TransAtlantic, the insurance concern, said he was not surprised at the level of interest in companies seeking a listing. 'The stock market is valuing property companies at a premium to their net asset values at the moment after being at a huge discount earlier this year.' Mr Jollee denied market rumours that his division is to be floated. Mr Humphrey Price, chairman of Pillar, said yesterday that a flotation was 'one option under review,' but declined to give any other details.</p>

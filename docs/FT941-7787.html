			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Guardian Royal Careless talk costs money, as Guardian Royal Exchange found yesterday when it suggested that the UK insurance market showed signs of softening. The resulting 7 per cent fall in the shares was probably more than was warranted in the short run. But it is testimony to the way investors fear competition will develop now that balance sheets have been repaired and capacity increased. This time the insurance cycle could be tougher than usual. Direct Line telephone insurance has put additional pressure on pricing. With sluggish economic recovery, consumer demand for insurance is also likely to remain subdued. GRE, of course, simply intended to signal it was aware of the dangers and would proceed with caution. But insurance companies always say that sort of thing. The real test will be how they behave as the competition actually develops. GRE has one disadvantage in that it has come late to telephone selling. To justify the costs, it will need additional volume in what looks like a buyer's market. Then there is its weakness in life insurance, where operating profits of only Pounds 23m compare with Pounds 359m in other categories. Pressure on this side is bound to intensify as the Nationwide tie expires. At least GRE has rebuilt net assets without recourse to shareholders. That still leaves the question of how the capital will be deployed to earn a decent return. Unless it can find an answer GRE might have done better to follow recent banking examples and increase its dividend by more than 8.6 per cent. Perhaps it wants a bulwark against difficult times ahead. It needs more than that to justify a yield which, at 4.4 per cent, remains substantially below most of its peers. 3i 3i is in danger of becoming something of a tease. Talk of its imminent flotation seems to come around with the spring tides or the periodic low water marks of its owners' liquidity. Presumably advisers are happy to continue collecting fees for doing the same work time and again, but the banks' age-long indecisiveness risks undermining 3i's credibility and boring the market. Assuming that this is not a drill, one can understand the banks' desire to move now. Investment trust discounts to net assets are at their lowest for more than a generation. 3i would have a good shanty to sing about prospects for its wide spread of unquoted company investments. With recession and the working capital squeeze passing, small businesses may well be an attractive play. Certainly more so than two years ago when the clearers wanted to sell 3i as practically their only asset not damaged by flood. In the past year the FT-SE SmallCap index has handsomely outperformed the rest of the market. The risk, however, is that the pedestrian banks will miss the top of the cycle. Sagging bonds are already hinting at the mortality of the current bull run. And at these kinds of discount, investment trusts hardly count as cheap assets.</p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Rouble probe says fears caused fall The official investigation into the reasons for the more than 20 per cent fall in the value of the Russian rouble last week points to fears about the underlying weakness of the economy and not to subversive or criminal manipulation of the market, as senior Russian officials, including President Boris Yeltsin, initially suggested. Mr Mikhail Zadornov, a member of a special investigation into the currency collapse, said yesterday that rising inflation, lower bank interest rates, a new tax on bank deposits and a presidential decree ordering all transactions of more than Dollars 10,000 (Pounds 6,329) to be reported to the tax police came together to produce a flight from the rouble. The probe is being led by Mr Oleg Lobov, the secretary of the Security Council, which reports to Mr Yeltsin on matters of national security. The immediate cause of the rouble run, said Mr Zadornov, was 'weak co-ordination' between the Finance Ministry and the Central Bank. He said the bank, which had drawn heavily on hard currency reserves which stood at only Dollars 5bn on August 1 during trading in August and September, had ceased to intervene last week and precipitated the crash. The findings of a report by the commission investigating the currency fall, which has not yet been officially released, was confirmed yesterday by leading Moscow bankers. Mr Vladimir Vinogradov, president of Inkombank, said yesterday that a lack of financial products in which money could be invested  -apart from short-term Treasury bills - meant that fears of inflation and the drop in interest rates sent investors fleeing from the rouble into the dollar. 'Why can't the Central Bank develop a range of products as others are learning to do?' asked Mr Vinogradov. Fears of a further sharp fall in the rouble in trading yesterday were not fulfilled. The Russian currency fell by only eight points to end the day at Rbs2996 to the dollar. The currency fell to Rbs4000 to the dollar on 'Black Tuesday' last week, to recover after bank intervention to Rbs2888 last Friday. There is, however, less unanimity on the successor to Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the Central Bank chairman who resigned after what was said to be a frosty meeting with Mr Yeltsin last Friday - or even if his resignation is constitutionally in order. Mr Zadornov, chairman of the parliament's budget committee, said his committee believed the resignation, accepted by Mr Yeltsin, should be debated by parliament and suggested that Mr Gerashchenko should be re-appointed acting chairman until another candidate is found. Mr Vladimir Gusinsky, head of the Most financial group and vice-president of the Association of Russian Banks, said that the chairman 'must be a professional, not a macroeconomist' - a comment which indicated that the bank chiefs are against the appointment of either Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former finance minister, or Mr Yegor Gaidar, the former prime minister. The NTV independent TV channel - which Mr Gusinsky owns - reported on Sunday that Mr Gaidar would be appointed as head of the bank. However, his office said yesterday that Mr Gaidar would make no comment. Mr Fyodorov said that the rouble's fall was engineered by the Finance Ministry and the Central Bank to 'patch up the holes in the budget' by artificially lowering the rate of the rouble. He said the incident showed that the government had no defined economic policy and that there was 'insufficient political will' to continue economic reforms.</p>

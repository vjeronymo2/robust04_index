			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNFAIR PROPERTY TAX BASE  </P> <P> The true reason why "young people under 35 cannot afford to own their own homes  these days unless they have double income or they could get financial aid from  their parents" ("This Generation Gap Is Built on Real Estate" by Ellen Goodman,  Op-Ed Page March 29) is: Because, "Over the past 15 years, income fell behind  inflation and houses sped ahead" (as Ms. Goodman stated), but not because their  hard-working parents built "their good fortune by investing their savings into  real estate."  </P> <P> Twenty years ago, the average annual income was one-third of the average house  price. Today, average annual income is only one-tenth of the average house  price. Our government should face the fact of this "inflation" and raise the  minimum wage to $15 per hour. Then, competitive business employers will raise  their employees' average annual salary to the level of $100,000, or one-third  of the average house price "these days."  </P> <P> Trying to squeeze "parents' good fortune" to solve the problem, as Ms. Goodman  suggests ("tax more of the capital gains that came to those who rode the  real-estate boom"), would be an incorrect method to solve the fundamental  economic problem, just as our government has tried and failed, without facing  the true cause "over the past 15 years."  </P> <P> MIZUE D.

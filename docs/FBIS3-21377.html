I refer to President Clinton's  recent pronouncement on the Punjab. Personally he may not know  the distance between Tarn Taran and Timbuctoo but he has a large  embassy in New Delhi which must keep him informed of the ground  realities of the Punjab of today. And the ground reality is that  terrorists who had been losing ground have been wiped out.    They forfeited the little sympathy they had among the  peasantry as they degenerated from being politically or  religiously motivated to gangs of thugs bent on loot, murder and  rape. More than the Army or the police, it was the peasantry of  the Punjab which barred their doors against them.    I have no doubt that there must have been incidents of  police  high-handedness and violation of human rights, as they would be  in the best organised societies in the world faced by goons who  have no respect for laws or norms of civilised behaviour.    In the Punjab they were not on so large a scale as to invite  censure from the head of a friendly state. More unpardonable  than ignorance of the changed situation in the Punjab is the  White House lending ear to the culmination of a handful of  emigrants styling themselves as the Council of Khalistan.  Whatever support there was for Khalistan has eroded leaving one  man with a tiny office in Washington publishing grossly  exaggerated stories of anti-Sikh repression by the Punjab police  and para-military forces. This one man financed by a rich farmer  in California has, however, established contacts with members of  the American Congress and Senators and raised funds for them. In  return they make anti-Indian noises in Congress and the Senate.  It may not be too bad an idea for our Government to extend  invitations to these American politicians to visit the Punjab,  talk to the people including erstwhile terrorists and see things  for themselves.

			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / EU and US try to remove trade hurdles: A race against time to open up public purchases to competition European Union and US officials are meeting this week to try to agree concessions central to fleshing out last year's accord in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to liberalise the world's public procurement markets. If they succeed, they will give a big boost to plans to open up to international competition contracts worth more than Dollars 300bn a year. But if they fail to resolve differences over market access, fresh trade tensions could erupt even before the agreement takes effect at the start of 1996. The EU and the US have already joined other industrialised powers in agreeing to bring public procurement of goods and services more firmly within Gatt and have made offers to open their markets further. Though the offers cannot be withdrawn, the two have yet to agree to extend the full benefits to each other. This week's talks, in Brussels, aim at securing improvements covering procurement by utilities and buyers below central government level. Such improvements would, in principle, also be offered to other signatories of the Gatt procurement code. But time is running short. Though public procurement is not formally part of the Uruguay Round, the US insists a deal with the EU must be reached by April 15 to be approved under the 'fast track' voting procedure, under which Congress votes on trade pacts without amendment. But though US-EU negotiations to date have made some progress, hurdles remain. Both sides believe last-minute horse-trading will be needed by Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, European trade commissioner, at this month's Gatt ministerial meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco. If no agreement is reached there, Brussels fears the EU could become an early target for unilateral US trade sanctions under its recently revived Super 301 provision for retaliation against unfair trade practices. Washington denies it is threatening such action. The Clinton administration is pressing the EU to end rules which favour European suppliers in tenders for telecommunications and power generation equipment. The rules give European companies a 3 per cent price preference and allow bids with less than 50 per cent EU content to be ignored. The US believes its suppliers are particularly competitive in these industries and says EU markets are more closed than its own. It claims European manufacturers have 13 per cent of the US public telephone exchange market, while US suppliers have only 1.5 per cent of Europe's market. But Brussels insists it will drop the preferential policy only if the US first does more to liberalise public procurement by individual states. Washington last week went some way towards this goal by increasing from 24 to 36 the number of states which, it says, are prepared to drop rules which exclude non-US - and, in some cases, all out-of-state - companies from bidding for public contracts. However, the EU wants more. As well as demanding that still further states be added to the list, it is stepping up pressure on the Clinton administration to phase out restrictions on state procurement imposed by the Buy American provisions of US law. The provisions, a relic of 1930s protectionism, exclude foreign suppliers from contracts for federally funded state public works programmes, such as highway and mass transit projects. However, the US has so far shied away from committing itself in a congressional election year to repeal legislation which guarantees orders for domestic industries. Its growing defensiveness has encouraged Brussels to believe it has gained the initiative in negotiations. 'The US cannot reasonably criticise us over preferential rules while so much of their market remains closed to foreign suppliers,' an EU official said.</p>

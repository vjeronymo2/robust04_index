			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Books: Life on the Red Planet RED MARS by Kim Stanley Robinson HarperCollins Pounds 14.99, 501 pages NO shimmering light in the night sky has exercised the human imagination so tirelessly as Mars. Al-Qahira, Ares, Harmakhis, Mangala, Nirgala, Aquakuh, Huo Hsing are a few of the haunting names by which the red planet has been known. Only since the Mariner probes and the Viking lander missions of 1976, however, has it been possible to speak accurately about the planet's surface and geography. In a tiny but significant way, humankind has even begun to modify the surface of Mars, as the photos of shallow trenches in the red dust scooped out by the Viking landers demonstrate. Now Kim Stanley Robinson has written the first novel about the prospective colonisation of the crimson planet. Mars itself, in its many moods, is the central character in this curiously absorbing book. If Mars is ever colonised, then it will surely happen very like this. The novel's chronology sets the first manned mission as early as 2020. The sheer weight of detail concerning the geography, geology and climatology of Mars which the author has assimilated is impressive, and the efforts of the colonists to transform the planet's poisonous carbon dioxide atmosphere and harsh extremes of temperature into an environment fitted to human life are fascinating because utterly plausible. Mars has, for instance, a canyon system as extensive as the entire US, cliffs 20,000 ft high, and volcanoes three times as tall as Everest. The planet's Great Escarpment is marred by old craters, overrun by lava, broken into hummocks and karsts and ridges, channels caused by giant floods from underground seas which burst onto the surface and flowed at rates ten thousand times that of the Mississippi. Kim Stanley Robinson has said that solitary travelling in wilderness territory provided the inspiration for many of the descriptive landscape scenes of this work, and it shows. Red Mars, the first volume of a planned trilogy, is the product of a imaginative love affair between the author and the Earth's nearest planetary neighbour.</p>

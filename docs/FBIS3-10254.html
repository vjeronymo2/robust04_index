I just heard a great phrase:  [When it comes] to research, information is more important than  labs. It is impossible to do research, no matter how many labs,  without information.    We are going to speak about information with engineer Carlos  Guerrero from the Biotechnology and Medical-Pharmaceutical  Industry Information and Consultation Center [Centro de  Informacion and Consultoria para la Biotecnologia y la Industria  Medico-farmaceutica], popularly known as Biotech.    [Guerrero] Biotech's goal is to provide logistic support to  every center and institution in the western scientific hub. The  support takes two main forms. The first is the preparation of  directories. For example, we created the Biotech International  Directory which has over 7,000 entries and includes 120  countries -- it lists the most important companies in this  sector in the world. It is available in printed form and on  compact disk, CD-ROM. It is undoubtedly one of the best  directories in the world on this subject. We also have other  directories such as the one on Cuban biological sciences, which  lists all the institutions working in biotechnology and the  medical-pharmaceutical industry in Cuba.    Another important Biotech line of work is analysis reports.  We prepare market reports, company profiles, product  performance, studies on issues such as cancer, optic diseases,  or others requested by our customers. We have another very  important product: The Biotech Guide for Export to Cuba. It  includes all the customs and noncustoms regulations, as well as  technical regulations for exporting biotechnology and medical  and pharmaceutical products to Cuba.    The information services Biotech provides to researchers are  also important. We have over 50 data bases available to  researchers. These include commercial and specialized  information for consultation at our libraries and center.    [Gonzalez] Are these Biotech services also available to  foreign companies or enterprises?    [Guerrero] Of course. It is not that we put our services on  the market, but that we have important customers abroad who use  our services.</p>

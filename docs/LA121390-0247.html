			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WYCHE ASSAILS TEAM PRACTICE FOR RAIDERS  </P> <P> Coach Sam Wyche gave a tongue-lashing to his Cincinnati Bengals players for  what he perceived as a lackluster preparation for Sunday's game against the  Raiders in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "There are a couple of players who aren't happy with me right now," Wyche said  following a private session with his players after Wednesday's practice.  </P> <P> "I hope they're so mad they'll play better."  </P> <P> "Maybe, as much as anything, we need to get ourselves back on track for the  Raiders game," Wyche said.  </P> <P> Quarterback Boomer Esiason said Wyche was pretty upset with some members of the  team.  </P> <P> "In some respects, it was long overdue," Esiason said. "I don't blame him. The  coaches aren't paid to be our friends. They're paid to be our critics."  </P></p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Working Life: Ingredients are paramount at Granita - Eating Out There is nothing remotely fussy about Granita. The austerity of its large plate-glass window, its plain wooden floor and the unadorned walls and tables announce that nothing will distract from the enjoyment of food and, yes, of chattering. For this is the legendary Islington dinner party writ large. The place hums with animated but not overbearing conversation from a smart and relaxed crowd which can be expected to include actors, lawyers, journalists and politicians. The celebrated Tony Blair-Gordon Brown dinner seems not to have gone to its head and there was friendly and efficient service from a young and enthusiastic team. Granita's no-nonsense approach finds further expression in the understated but attractive presentation of the Mediterranean-inspired dishes and the adequate size of the portions. Prices are reasonable and the main courses come complete, so there are no extras to inflate the bill. The restaurant, in Upper Street, Islington, concentrates on the three essentials of successful cooking - ingredients, ingredients, and ingredients. Only the best will do, it seems, and there is nothing flashy in the preparation. It is all so deceptively simple you might flatter yourself you could serve something similar on your stripped pine table - if you could only face the trek to Steve Hatt's for the fish, to Chapel Market for the veg, and on to Olga's for the oils and the dried tomatoes. But even with the culinary skills you would be missing another vital ingredient - chef and owner Ahmed Kharshoum's confidence and ingenuity in combining and contrasting flavours to such original effect. Oak smoked salmon (Pounds 5.95) came with dill and sour cream - nothing too surprising there - but the accompanying onion pancake was a neat touch. Main courses are a mouthful - and that's just on the menu. 'Roasted chump of new seasons lamb (pink), provencal potato gratin, lemon thyme, olives, steamed runner beans (Pounds 9.95)'. The meat, topping a mound of the other equally succulent items, was a treat. My friend was delighted with her fillet of yellowfin tuna (Pounds 10.25), peppered and chargrilled to bring out the fullest flavour. It came with lime butter for extra zest and was accompanied by mange tout, red pepper and garlic potatoes. There was still room for a remarkable combination of apricot and cherry crisp with egg nog ice cream and, for me, a smooth luxurious blackberry fool with hazelnut biscuits (both Pounds 3.50). Wines are reasonably priced with Chile, Australia and New Zealand well represented. There is an intriguing range of dessert wines. The short menu, typically four starters, four main courses and a pasta option, changes every Tuesday. Granita, 127 Upper Street, London N1 1QP, tel 071 226 3222. Open Tue-Sun for dinner, Wed-Sun for lunch. Set lunch Pounds 11.50 for two courses, Pounds 13.50 for three. Nearest Tube: Highbury and Islington.</p>

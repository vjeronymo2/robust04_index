			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow finds jobs figures a damp squib Wall Street A REASONABLY positive set of October employment figures failed to set US stock markets alight yesterday and share prices finished near their opening values, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 3.78 at 3,240.06, having spent the entire day no more than five points either side of Thursday's close. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.76 at 417.58, while the Amex composite was 0.57 higher at 383.26 and the Nasdaq composite 2.73 higher at 616.81. NYSE turnover was 206m shares, and declines ran almost neck and neck at 893 to 865, respectively. The keenly-awaited October employment report was a damp squib. Although the 27,000 rise in non-farm payrolls (49,000 if the effect of the special summer jobs programme were excluded) and the one percentage-point decline in the national unemployment rate to 7.4 per cent suggested labour market conditions were moving in the right direction, the figures were not bullish enough to produce much of a reaction from equity investors. Neither were they bad enough to prompt another cut in interest rates from the Federal Reserve. Enthusiasm was also dampened by the reaction of the bond market to the jobs data. The benchmark 30-year bond dropped three quarters of a point, pushing the yield to 7.75 per cent, after the figures were released. Stock market investors have been worried that the steady rise in long-term Treasury market rates since the end of summer will slow the already sluggish economic recovery. Among individual stocks, McDonnell Douglas fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 55 7/8 after Moody's Investors Service, the big ratings agency, said it was putting the company's debt under review for a possible downgrade. Eljer Industries rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 10 5/8 after the company said that an appeals court had upheld its decision favouring Eljer in a suit filed by two insurance companies. Woolworth firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 33 7/8 after the retailing group revealed that it might sell some of its 500 stores in Germany. Foodmaker dropped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 12 1/8 after the securities house, Lehman Brothers, cut its rating on the stock because it believed the share price may have peaked for the immediate term. On the Nasdaq market, Food Lion plunged more than Dollars 3 to Dollars 6 in early trading after an unfavourable television programme. The shares later recovered some of their lost ground to end Dollars 1 lower at Dollars 8 1/4 in turnover of 8.8m shares. Canada TORONTO stocks ended the week sharply lower, depressed by a slide in gold shares following a drop in bullion prices and renewed fears that Canada's Bronfman family empire was once again in trouble. Based on preliminary figures, the TSE-300 index fell 28.85 points, or 0.86 per cent, to 3,310.91. Declines led advances 321 to 249, volume of 39,442m shares was above Thursday's 36.589m shares, and trading value was CDollars 337.3m against CDollars 366.1m. On the week, the index lost about 25 points.</p>

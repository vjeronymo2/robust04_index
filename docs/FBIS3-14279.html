President Hafiz al-Asad led those who received President  Salih on the tarmac. [passage omitted] The two presidents held  a meeting at Tishrin Palace attended by the official Yemeni  delegation, Vice Presidents 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam and Muhammad  Zuhayr Mashariqah, Prime minister Mahmud al-Zu'bi. [passage  omitted]    Upon arrival in Damascus, President Salih made a statement  to  the SYRIAN ARAB NEWS AGENCY, in which he said: I am glad to  visit sisterly Syria to meet with my brother President Hafiz  al-Asad and to discuss with him all issues that concern our two  fraternal countries and our Arab nation at the present stage.  For us, the visit will be an opportunity to acquaint brother  President Hafiz al-Asad with developments and the situation in  our country and efforts to overcome the political crisis and  implement the accord document, signed in Amman, in order to  maintain unity and build the modern Yemeni state. We in the  Republic of Yemen cannot do without the role of the brothers in  Syria, led by brother President Hafiz al-Asad. They have always  been with us. They have always embodied the sincerity of the  pan-Arab position toward their brothers in Yemen and have been  eager to maintain Yemeni unity, which is a pan-Arab gain before  being a Yemeni gain. Preserving this unity is an Arab  responsibility, because it is an important factor for  consolidating security, stability, and peace in the region. It  is also an advanced step toward realizing the pan-Arab unionist  objective that strengthens Arab power and meets Arab aspirations  for progress.    Undoubtedly, our talks will deal with developments in the  Arab arena and issues that concern our Arab nation, foremost of  which are developments in the Palestine question and the  Arab-Israeli peace negotiations.    We reiterate our country's position that supports the  efforts, led by steadfast Syria, to realize a just and  comprehensive peace in the region based on the restoration of  Arab rights, foremost of which is the Palestinian Arab people's  right to return to their land and set up their independent state  on their national soil, and Israel's withdrawal from occupied  Arab territory in the Golan and south Lebanon.</p>

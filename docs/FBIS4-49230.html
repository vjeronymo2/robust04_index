			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Flor Wang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 27 (CNA) -- The Ministry of Foreign  Affairs Wednesday [27 April] formally announced the itinerary  for President Li Teng-hui's trip to Central America and Africa.    Li will first head to Managua, Nicaragua next Wednesday on  board a China Airlines chartered flight. He will then visit  Costa Rica and South Africa, where he has been invited to attend  presidential inauguration ceremonies on May 6 and May 8,  respectively.    Prior to his return to Taipei on May 15, Li will also visit  Swaziland on May 12, the Foreign Affairs Ministry reported.    Li will seek to strengthen and consolidate cooperative ties  and friendly relationships with the four countries, Presidential  Spokesman Raymond Tai said.    He said the trip is part of the Republic of China [ROC]'s  strategy to play a more active role in the international  community -- a policy it is pursuing as payback for the help it  received from other countries during its own course of  development.</p>

			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KID BEAT: TWO VARIED PRODUCTIONS AT THE WEST END PLAYHOUSE  </P> <P> "The Wonder Faire" at the West End Playhouse is a treat for children and  adults. The one-man Dance-on-Wheels production features Gideon Potter in 45  minutes of mime and comic nonsense, much of it involving the audience.  </P> <P> Potter, a long-jawed, highly physical performer, not only resembles actor John  Cleese, but brings a Monty Python-like (non)sensibility to his offbeat  children's show.  </P> <P> In a sketch about the right way to eat -- sandwich first, then dessert -- a  lunch box takes on a surprising life of its own. A tale about an old man, a  fish and a bird adopting a wolf with criminal tendencies is told with masks and  humorous body language.  </P> <P> When chubby toddlers and whimsical adults from the audience are invited on  stage and threaten to run away with the show, Potter maintains control, while  adding to the levity offstage and on. It's over all too soon.  </P> <P>  At 7446 Van Nuys Blvd. in Van Nuys, indefinitely, Saturdays at 2 p.m. Tickets,  $6; (818) 990-5807. LYNNE HEFFLEY  </P></p>

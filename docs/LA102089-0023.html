			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> American Brands Inc.: The Old Greenwich, Conn., consumer products company with  three core businesses -- tobacco, distilled spirits and life insurance --  posted a third-quarter record profit of $166 million, up 13% from a year  earlier. Revenue totaled $3.1 billion, down 2%. The results were attributed to  the absence of Southland Life, which was sold in March, and the impact of the  stronger U.S. dollar on overseas results.  </P></p>

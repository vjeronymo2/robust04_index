			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / How To Spend It: Male Order - What is the perfect gift for a man? The best way to find out is ask ..a man. The answers may be surprising James Hawke Artist Object of desire: Jack Russell 'If I could have anything, I would have a 'Jackie' Russell and I'd buy her a Hermes collar (by special order).' Matt Idiens Entrepreneur Object of desire: wooden backgammon board 'I've got everything a boy could want: a motorbike, car, mobile phone and a gorgeous girlfriend.  The only thing I might want is for a long lost and very rich uncle to give me a fortune, or failing that, a beautiful wooden backgammon board.' Bill Sermon Director and Design Consultant Object of Desire: CD-Rom 'With the pressures of work, there's less time to go out.  A CD-Rom short-circuits the hassle of getting to places.  It's exploration at my desk.  It means I can visit the National Gallery, for example, before going there.  It has now become a bit of a cult with lots of small companies producing CD-Rom magazines.' Julian French Corporate Finance Solicitor Object of Desire: 1965 Ford Mustang Coupe 'Well, obviously it's because it's economical to run and easy to park - probably Freud would have had something to say about it.' David Lance Alvarez Senior Sales Officer and Futures Specialist Object of Desire: IWC Schaffhausen-Portugieser 'It's the definitive gentleman's watch.' Alex Novi Tanker Chartering Manager Object of Desire: Custom Sail 'For the hell of it, to fly, to get off the ground.' Massimo Cagnoli Managing Director Objects of Desire: Sharp IQ 8920 personal organiser and the GSM International mobile phone 'I can't cope with a diary any more and I'm fed up with finding girls' numbers with no name in my pockets, so I must have a personal organiser.  I would also like an international mobile phone because it's very stressful when I am abroad to have to keep an eye open for phones.</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Portals at Pounds 14m and mills working at full capacity PORTALS GROUP, the special-ist paper and environmental protection and control products group, yesterday reported a 9 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits and said a strong inflow of orders meant that its mills were working at full capacity. Pre-tax profits grew from Pounds 12.4m to Pounds 13.5m in the six months to June 30, on turnover from continuing operations of Pounds 91.2m (Pounds 83.9m). Discontinued operations added another Pounds 7.23m to turnover in the comparable period. Earnings per share, fully diluted, increased by 9 per cent to 14.89p (13.68p) and the interim dividend is raised to 5.25p (5p). Mr John Lloyd, managing director, said Portals was pleased to have increased sales and profits in what remained a challenging commercial environment. Within papermaking he said orders were strong, but noted that 'there is a production challenge to meet this demand'. The benefits of last autumn's devaluation had been used to improve competitiveness and boost volumes, rather than margins, which already stand at about 20 per cent. As a result there had been strong order inflows at all three papermaking companies. In particular Portals (Bathford) won three new overseas contracts and was recently awarded the DSS contract to produce high security covers for pension and other allowance books, and JR Crompton, the round tea-bag maker, had had 'an excellent first half'. The security and specialist papermaking operations raised operating profits by 4 per cent to Pounds 9.9m on sales up by 10 per cent to Pounds 51.6m. Results from the protection and control division were more mixed. The division lifted operating profits by 14 per cent to Pounds 3.6m on sales of Pounds 39.6m, an increase of 7 per cent. Margins were higher than in the first half of 1992, but below the exceptionally high levels of the second half, while orders were maintained. The two core businesses within the division, Houseman and Computer Technology, performed well, but elsewhere the effects were felt of the increasingly difficult market in continental Europe. The downturn in the French car market hit Ermeto's diesel tube business, while Vacuumatic suffered from the impact of the German recession. Portals ended June with net cash of Pounds 7.1m, an improvement of Pounds 9.9m in the period, although net cash fell to Pounds 1m on July 1 after payment of the 1992 final dividend. The improvement in the cash position came after relatively low capital expenditure of Pounds 4.3m, the Pounds 1.8m acquisition of Sonoco Packaging Tapes, which manufactures the security threads found in banknotes, and a Pounds 1.6m increase in working capital, which were offset by the disposal of Airoil-Flaregas for Pounds 3.9m.</p>

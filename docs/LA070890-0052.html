			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WILLIE BROWN DENIES CONNECTION WITH SILBERMAN  </P> <P> Assembly Speaker Willie Brown on Saturday emphatically denied allegations that  he may have funneled into his law practice money from businesses with an  interest in bills considered by the Legislature.  </P> <P> Brown, a San Francisco Democrat, said the charges, attributed by the FBI to  convicted San Diego businessman Richard T. Silberman, are "totally and  completely unsupported."  </P> <P> "It's an irresponsible allegation made by a sick man who's been convicted,"  Brown told The Times in an interview on the Assembly floor.  </P> <P> Silberman's comments were reflected in notes taken by an FBI agent in April,  1989, when Silberman was arrested on charges of laundering money characterized  by an undercover agent as drug-trafficking profits. Silberman, once the top  aide to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., was convicted June 28 of violating  federal currency law and awaits sentencing.  </P> <P> At the time of his arrest, according to the FBI, Silberman sought leniency by  offering to set up Brown and others he said he had helped establish foreign  corporations to launder money.  </P> <P> Notes of the meeting, taken by FBI agent Charles Walker, indicate that  Silberman described Chula Vista City Councilman David Malcolm as Brown's  "bagman" and that Brown's San Francisco law office had a connection to  legislation involving the state unitary tax law and the proposed merger of  Southern California Edison Corp. and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co.  </P> <P> Part of the notes read:  </P> <P> "7/83 -- Jap. meeting re unitary tax"  </P> <P> "25K 'legal fee' -- millions in savings"  </P> <P> After leaving former Gov. Brown's staff, Silberman lobbied the Legislature on  behalf of Japanese business interests seeking to overhaul the state's unitary  tax law, which involves the way the state assesses multinational corporations  that do business in California.  </P> <P> In 1986, the Legislature revised the system in a way more favorable to foreign  corporations.  </P> <P> Brown, speaking after the Assembly completed a rare Saturday session  deliberating on the state budget, said he had "no connection at all" to any of  the businesses Silberman represented.  </P> <P> "I'd really like to have him go through my client list and tell me which one of  those non-Japanese were involved in the unitary matter," Brown said. "I  represent developers and movie stars and record executives and that's it. I  don't have any other clients."  </P> <P> Brown also said his law firm has never been connected to Southern California  Edison. And he said he had "no idea" why Silberman would describe Malcolm as  his "bagman" -- a term used in political circles to describe a person who acts  as an intermediary for illicit payments from special interests to elected  officials.  </P> <P> Brown has twice appointed Malcolm to the state Coastal Commission, but he said  he first did so at the recommendation of local officials and members of the  Legislature.  </P> <P> "I rejected Malcolm twice," Brown said. "I rejected him because he was a  Republican. They kept sending him back. (State Sen.) Lucy Killea (D-San Diego)  and (Assemblyman) Pete Chacon (D-San Diego) and all the Republicans in this  house and Democrats in this house lobbied me to accept the recommendations, and  I did and I'm really glad I did.  </P> <P> "David's turned out to be a first-class guy. I wish I could get him to raise  money for me."  </P> <P> Despite his denials, Brown said he could understand why Silberman, desperate to  escape prosecution, would try to finger him.  </P> <P> "I practiced law for a long time, and every time I've represented anybody who's  gotten nailed, the first thing they start asking me about is, is there some way  we can give them (the police) somebody," Brown said. "They say we'll give them  somebody who can't get back at us, and we'll give them somebody they might  believe.  </P> <P> "Why Willie Brown? I have no idea. I have no connection at all."  </P></p>

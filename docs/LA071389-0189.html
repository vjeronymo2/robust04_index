			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A BOWL FULL OF BASKETS OF DELIGHTS;  </P> <P> 68TH SEASON'S OPENING NIGHT IS FIRST CLASS ALL THE WAY  </P> <P> There are some things that improve with age: The Hollywood Bowl is one. Tuesday  night was heaven. For the opening night of the 68th Bowl season, the skies were  friendly -- only one helicopter. As twilight took its sweet time about becoming  night, the silhouette of lined up trees on the hill behind the bowl was a  painting worthy of Sotheby's.  </P> <P> It was all first class. The official Steinway. Schramsberg champagne. Beluga  caviar. Lobster bisque. Silver goblets. Blue Willow china. The green wicker  picnic baskets that everyone used to get with Blue Chip Stamps scattered  throughout the Garden and Terrace box areas.  </P> <P> And there was Nancy Reagan in Box 1131. A memorable Tchaikovsky finale  conducted by Yuri Temirkanov. Orrin Howard's program notes. Polite parking  attendants.  </P> <P> Was it going well? "When hasn't it?" Philharmonic executive director Ernest  Fleischmann quipped, noting that Russian emigre Vladimir Feltsman would be  starring as pianist in Beethoven's Concerto No. 4 in G, and that Feltsman's  wife, Anna, had the artist's box.  </P> <P> That was Box 1131, where the lookouts were posted waiting for Nancy Reagan. She  and son Ron Reagan and his wife, Doria, were the special guests of the  Feltsmans because of aid in getting them out of the Soviet Union. "For us, they  are the best people; we love them," Anna said, throwing her arms around Nancy  Reagan. (Former President Ronald Reagan was in Anaheim, co-announcing the  All-Star game with Vin Scully.)  </P> <P> In their corner box, where they hosted Dody and Otis Booth, Carol and Mike  Inman spread black and white plaid place mats, flew black and white balloons  and set their hook-on trays with herb bouquets and white narcissus.  </P> <P> It took both Judy and Steaven Jones to carry the load of their green hamper  filled with goodies Judy had concocted from recipes in the Los Angeles Junior  League Cookbook. Daryn and Bill Horton were waiting for them with "a little  Schramsberg."  </P> <P> Elsewhere, Colette and Charles Witt had pate from the Biltmore Hotel out for  Louise and Tom Jones. Maury and Carolyn De Wald and Carla and Rudy Rehm were  eating Brie before the beef tenderloin and lemon bars. Dee and Bob Wilson set  up blue agapanthus and red and white roses for Gretchen and George Gibbs before  presenting Veuve Clicquot.  </P> <P> Brian Panosian wore his yellow suspenders and sat in the $4 top-row seats (the  better to see the stars), dropping by twice to see his parents, Vera (chairman  of the Hollywood Bowl Volunteers) and Howard Panosian in their box.  </P> <P> Marian and Stanley Brown had moved that day into the Mirabella condos on  Wilshire. But the Bowl, with Terry and Diane Mullin as their regular opening  night guests, is a tradition. The picnic went on.  </P> <P> Speaking of tradition, Norma and David McIntyre always serve lobster bisque;  enjoying were Janice and Bob Carpenter.  </P> <P> Where did she want to go for her 19th birthday? Lindsey Kozberg said the Bowl,  and parents Joanne and Roger Kozberg obliged, bringing along Andrea Van de  Kamp, whose husband, John, was off campaigning for governor.  </P> <P> Alan (he's Philharmonic board secretary) and Nancy Wayte opened the Bristol  Farms chervil chicken for Judge William and Julie Masterson.  </P> <P> The Bowl calls for a best effort. Whitley Collins did just that. He invited  John Roberts, Hayden Eaves and Scott Kerslake to sit in his parents' box. With  youthful gusto, they chowed down on sandwiches.  </P> <P> RELATED STORY: Calendar, Page 1  </P></p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / President calls for further rate cut by Fed PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday called on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates further, on the grounds that the risk of renewed inflation was now very slight. His remarks, and a fall in US durable goods orders, helped to provoke a sharp fall in the dollar yesterday. The dollar closed in New York at its lowest level against the German D-Mark since January 8. The president's concern about the sluggish rate of economic recovery received some validation yesterday with the report that durable goods orders in May fell sharply by 2.4 per cent, after revised increases of 1.9 per cent and 2.1 per cent respectively in April and March. Although the monthly durable goods figures are notoriously volatile, the figures for last month were worse than the markets had expected and led to a decline in long-term Treasury bond rates. The Commerce Department said the drop in orders for transport equipment, especially aircraft, and for defence goods accounted for most of the overall decline - but no important industrial sector recorded an increase. 'I don't think the argument that lowering the rates will stimulate the long term - shoot the long-term rates up - is valid any more,' Mr Bush said in an interview with the New York Times. Inflation was not 'the big problem now.' In the interview, Mr Bush expressed political frustration that the statistical improvement in the economy this year had not been reflected in the public opinion polls. These still show a popular perception of continuing decline and a lack of confidence in his ability to manage the economy. He insisted he had to be 'a little careful about Fed bashing', but 'I don't know of any president that would like to advocate higher interest rates - and certainly I'm not one.' The central bank, however, has preferred a cautious approach. It last lowered the overnight federal funds rate on April 9 to 3.75 per cent from 4 per cent. In December it had cut the discount rate by a full percentage point to 3.5 per cent. It was reported to have decided on a neutral stance at the last meeting of its open market committee, in May. Mr Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, told Congress last week that considerable progress towards price stability had been made, but that the bank 'fully intends to guard against re-igniting inflation'. Mr Bush's economic and political advisers are known to be concerned about the halting economic recovery. It is axiomatic that the president's re-election chances hinge in good part on a more vigorous US expansion. The jump last month in unemployment - to 7.5 per cent - was precisely the sort of economic statistic that the president does not need at present. Currrencies, page 35</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [passage omitted] 'Inflation has been pushed  back, from 67 per cent in 1991 down to 17.5 per cent in 1992 and  only 5.2 per cent in 1993. [passage omitted]    'The external economic relations have been broadened in the  line of diversification and multilaterization. We have overcome  the consequences of the sudden [words missing] of our  traditional market, widened the interflow with new partners, and  increased the export value by roughly 20 per cent annually. Up  to the end of 1993, we have granted 836 licences for direct  foreign investment with a total registered capital of 7.5  billion USD recorded initial successes in attracting more  development assistance and loans on preferential terms from  governments and reestablished normal relations with  international financial and monetary institutions.    'The economy has started to yield internal accumulations,  albeit small. The life of the majority of the population has  been improved.    'A multi-sector economic structure is taking shape. Initial  steps have been taken to re-arrange and re-register state  enterprises. The number of long-time loss-making enterprises  has been largely reduced. The number of efficient business  units has increased. In general, the state economic sector has  kept developing and continues to hold key areas and a leading  role in the national economy its share in GDP has grown from 34  per cent in 1990 to 39.9 per cent in 1992. Since the 5th plenum  of the Central Committee, the agricultural cooperatives have got  a more clearly defined orientation for renewal the autonomous  role of the peasant households has been confirmed. New forms of  the cooperative aconomy have appeared. Wuth the land law  formally granting peasants the right to use land has got  additional development motive. The individual economy on a  stable and durable basis, the peasant household economy and  private capitalist economy have developed considerably. There  have emerged a growing number of stock holding enterprises and  joint ventures with investments from various forms of ownership.    'The market mechanism under management by the state and with  socialist orientation is becoming the operational mechanism of  the economy. The amendment of laws and the continous renewal of  the mechanism and policies related to planning, pricing,  exchange rates, finance, banking, labour, remuneration, land...,  have created a more favourable environment for the enterprises  to bring into full play their dynamism, autonomy and  self-responsibility in production and business.    'The state has accumulated more experience, and made  progress  in the macro-management and administration of the national  economy...    'The second most important achievement is that we have  maintained and consolidated political stability.    'Thanks to the many-sided achievements of renewal,  especially  socio-economic achievements, thanks to the firm leadership of  the party and the political awareness of the people and armed  forces throughout the country, we have surmounted the recent  political upheaval in the world. The party's leading role has  been consolidated, the state's management effeciveness has been  heightened, democracy has been broadened, national defence and  security have been secured, the people's confidence in the  party, the state and the renewal process has been strengthened,  and the mass movement in certain economic and social fields has  been some development...    'The third achievement is that our external relations have  been expanded, our country's prestige in the world has been  heightened, and a favourable international environment has been  created for our efforts in national construction and defence.    'The 7th congress defined the task related to our foreign  policy which is to maintain peace, broaden relations of  friendship and cooperation, create favourable international  conditions for national construction and defence, while actively  contributing to the common struggle of the world people for  peace, national independence, democracy and social progress.  The congress emphasized the open character of our foreign  policy: 'Vietnam wishes to be a friend of all nations in the  world community, endeavouring for peace, independence and  development.'    'In the face of the new developments of the world and  regional situation after the 7th congress, the third plenum of  the central committee concretized and developed that line. We  have taken the initiative and actively expanded our external  activities, and have recorded very important results.    'We have restored normal relations with the People's  Republic of China and initially developed relations of  friendship and cooperation with it, 'strengthened and  consolidated our relationship of special solidarity with the Lao  People's Democratic Republic, signed and strictly implemented  the Paris Agreement on Cambodia, and established friendly  neighbour relations with the Kingdom of Cambodia.    'We have improved and opened a new stage in our relations of  cooperation and friendship with ASEAN vountries and with ASEAN  as an organization and expanded our relations with other  countries in Asia and the Pacific.    'We have preserved and developed our traditional relations  with Cuba, India and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.    'We have maintained and promoted our existing relations of  cooperation with the Russian Federation, other countries of the  former Soviet Union, and Eastern European countries.    'We have accorded continuous support to the just cause of  the  peoples of Palestine, other Arab nations and South Africa,  broadened our relations with developing countries in Asia,  Africa and Latin America and contributed actively to the  consolidation of the Non- Aligned Movement and the promotion of  its role in the new situation.    'We have improved our relations with countries of Western  Europe, Northern Europe and the European Economic Community,  with Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and newly  industrialized countries. We have restored normal relations with  international financial and monetary organizations. The process  of struggle to get the United States lift the embargo and  normalize relations with Vietnam has made certain progress'.    On weaknesses and and newly emerging issues, the report  says:    'The ecomomy retains the character of a backward  agricultural  economy. Industries remain minor and infrastructure facilities,  underdeveloped. Not much has been achieved in the construction  of the material and technical basis. Accumulation from within  the economy and develophent investments are still limited and  not given adequate attention. Although the economy has known a  fairly high growth rate, productivity, quality and efficiency  remain very low. Not much production capacity has been added up  as a reserve force to be utilized in the time to come, leaving  negative effects on the growth tempo of the coming years.    '... Certain achievements have been recorded in the cultural  and social fields, but here, many major and urgent problems  remain unsolved.    'Total or partial unemployment in both urban and rural  areas,  especially among young people coming of labour age, remains  aburning question and one of the basic causes of social evils.    'The policies related to social equity have not been  properly  implemented. Beside people who get rich by lawful means, there  are not a few who have got rich quickly through illicit  businesses. Meanwhile, many families who made great sacrifices  and suffered great losses duging the wars of resistance, or who  rendered great services to the motherland, are still beleaguered  with difficulties. The number of persons living in poverty and  food shortage is still high. The people's living standards are  still very low in many areas, especially on the highlands, in  out-of-the-way places, and localities inhabited by ethnic  minorities...    'In the political situation, there remain many complicated  factors not to be slighted.    'The party and state agencies and offices are not yet really  pure and steady. Political security is still indequate and  social order yet to be secured'...    Part ii on the main tasks for the coming period, the report  points out:    'Our people are faced with acute challenges as well as great  opportunities.    'The challenges are: the danger of our economy falling  further behind other countries in the region and the world due  to our low starting point, our still low and unstable growth  rate and to the fact that we have to develop in an environment  of tough competition the possibility of our going astray from  the socialist orientation if we fail to correct errors in the  conduct of the implementation and our failure to repel  corruption and other social evils the scheme and acts of  'peaceful evolution' by hostile forces.    'However, we also have many fundamental advantages: our  party  has set out a correct line, is of one mind and united our people  are diligent, intelligent and patriotic, possessed of a firm  character and a staunch revolutionary will, and confident in the  party leadership, the armed forces are absolutely loyal to our  party's and people's revolutionary cause, our successes in the  cause of renewal are giving the country a new posture and  strength to more forward the development of the scientific and  technological revolution and the tendency toward broad  cooperation for development in the world and the region are  providing us with possible additional resources of  importance...[as received]    Following are the main tasks:    'To encourage the economic restructuring along the line of  industrialization and modernization...    'To consistently effect policies for the development of a  multisector economy, create more motivations and favourable  environment for the economic sectors and businesses of all forms  to make fast development and achieve high efficiency...    'To build synchronously the market mechanism under state  management and with socialist orientation...    'To care for cultural and social matters: the guiding idea  threading through the party and state decisions and policies in  the cultural and social fields is to care for, foster and  promote the human factor as both motive and objective of the  revolution. Outstanding problems in this work now are  employment, social justice, improvement of the people's  intellectual level, making the society wholesome and preserving  and promoting the national cultural identity...    ...'Fighting against corruption is a burning and pressing  problem at present. It must be carried out in a resolved and  thorough manner throughout the apparatus at all levels and in  all branches from the centre to the grassroots...    ...'To ensure national defence and security.    'To continve broademisg external relations'.    We will broaden relations of friendship and cooperation with  other countries on the principles of equality, mutual benefit,  peaceful co-esistence, respect for each other's independence,  sovereignty and territorial integrity, settling disputes by  negotiations, and maintaining stability, security and  development...    'To build a law-governed Vietnamese state of the people, by  the people and for the people... And...'To renew and streamline  the party, consolidate the relationship between the party and  the people...'.</p>

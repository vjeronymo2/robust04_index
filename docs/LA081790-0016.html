			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELECTION ISSUES: S&amp;LS, ABORTION  </P> <P> So Wilson is being challenged by Feinstein to vote against the confirmation of  Souter if Souter isn't a firm proponent of abortion rights.  </P> <P> If justices are to be placed on the court according to their stance on this one  issue, can we say Feinstein would fully support Souter if he was a proponent of  abortion rights, yet legally inept? Would she have a pro-choice court, even if  the justices couldn't tie their own shoelaces?  </P> <P> PETER LEFEVRE  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

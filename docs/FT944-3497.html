			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Arts: Goldschmidt premiere - Concert For all the confrontational nature of much of its art, the 20th century has given us a surprisingly large number of accessible violin concertos by composers as diverse as Bartok, Britten, Prokofiev, Shostakovich and Walton. At its first British concert performance on Thursday at the Royal Festival Hall, 40 years after its completion, Berthold Goldschmidt's Violin concerto was given every chance to succeed as well: the interpretation, at least, seemed everything the composer could have wished for. Such belated premieres are nothing new for the Jewish refugee who settled in England, where he abandoned composition entirely. Recently Goldschmidt's fortunes have changed and he has resumed composing. CDs of both his earlier and later music are proliferating and his two operas have recently been staged in Germany. The Violin concerto offers no grandiose world-view such as one might expect from a composer who was instrumental in getting Mahler's music recognised in Britain. It owes more to Stravinsky and Hindemith, an attractive four movement work, new-classical in outline but shot through with darker undercurrents. The fourth movement is perhaps less convincing than the first three, which are beautifully crafted and idiomatically written for the violin. The first, in particular, shows Goldschmidt at his finest: rhapsodic in form, one idea generates the next in a succession of episodes which embrace a gamut of moods from bitter-sweet lyricism to turbulent polyphony. My only doubts lay with the quality of the work's raw materials. The gestures are all in place, but are the melodies memorable enough? The young Canadian violinist Chantal Juillet certainly tried to convince us that they were, dispatching the often fiendish solo part with heroic aplomb. Charles Dutoit and the Philharmonia Orchestra provided firm, colourful support, on top form after opening with a reliable but solid account of Bizet's Second L'Arlesienne Suite. In spite of the obvious attractions of the Goldschmidt, however, it was a magisterial account of Prokofiev's Fifth Symphony which provided the most nourishing experience of the evening. Even though the orchestra's guest leader, Hugh Bean, collapsed dramatically during the first movement (he was later reported to be comfortable in hospital), the orchestra responded with playing of great power and warmth, fully at one with Dutoit's broad, romantic conception and firm structural command of a work which can all too easily sound protracted and coarse - a fine tribute to the Philharmonia's professionalism and Dutoit's consummate artistry.

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Lamont firmly defends ERM policy MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, insisted yesterday that a devaluation of sterling would not achieve lower interest rates. The only way to low inflation, healthy growth, more jobs and higher living standards was to maintain the pound's membership of the European exchange rate mechanism at the present central rate of DM2.95. 'There is no alternative,' Mr Lamont said, borrowing an old slogan from the recently ennobled Baroness Thatcher. Although his speech was directed at jittery foreign exchange markets and nervous Tory backbenchers, it was also a response to reports that the former prime minister had warned of a 'financial accident' in the event of unchanged policies. Mr Lamont said yesterday's news that the inflation rate had fallen to an annual 3.9 per cent in June represented a 'significant breakthrough'. For the first time since 1986, UK inflation was lower than the European Community average. But beating the average 'should not be good enough', he told the European Policy Forum in London. Other countries were also cutting inflation and two-thirds of UK exports went to countries with inflation rates lower than Britain's. The UK must aim for permanently low inflation, he said. Although Mr Lamont is sceptical about plans for European economic and monetary union, his speech was a forceful rejection of any other option for the UK than the existing monetary policy robust response to Tory concerns, like those attributed to Lady Thatcher, that high interest rates are choking recovery. After a week in which sterling fell through its theoretical lower limit in the narrow band of the EMS grid, he repeated that the government would in due course move the pound into the narrow bands at its current parity. Mr Lamont said there was no painless, cost-free route to higher growth with low inflation. He then proceeded to reject the arguments in favour of other options. Cutting interest rates immediately by two or three percentage points in the ERM was not a serious option, he said. France had tried to cut interest rates to below German levels last November but had to reverse the move quickly in spite of having a stable parity for five years. Britain's membership of the wide EMS bands gave it no extra leeway. An upwards realignment of the D-Mark was 'simply not on the agenda'. No other European country was prepared to sacrifice hard-won credibility by allowing its currency to be devalued against the D-Mark. A devaluation of sterling in the ERM would put interest rates up as financial markets would demand a risk premium for the pound. Leaving the ERM and cutting interest rates would persuade markets that Britain had given up on the fight against inflation and gone 'back to our bad oldways'. Quite soon interest rates would have to go back up again 'to much higher levels than they are today'. Leaving the ERM and setting interest rates according to domestic monetary targets offered no guarantee of lower interest rates. The 1980s had suggested the opposite because 'inside or outside the ERM, we could not ignore the level of interest rates in continental Europe', he said. He insisted that the current policy was the 'right one for the long-term health of the British economy'. If the UK could combine the improvements in the economy's performance achieved in the 1980s with permanently low inflation, it could build a 'world-class economy'.

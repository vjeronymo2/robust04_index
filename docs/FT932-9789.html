			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Pilkington suspends executives at US arm THE PRESIDENT and two top executives of Libbey-Owens-Ford, the US subsidiary of Pilkington, have been suspended during an internal investigation of 'discrepancies', the glass group said yesterday. The three are Mr Ron Skeddle, president and chief executive officer, Mr Ed Bryant, executive vice-president operations, and Mr Darryl Costin, executive vice president technology. They were suspended on Monday after it was discovered that the three 'appeared to fail to follow corporate procedures', Pilkington said. Mr Trevor Jones, chairman of LOF's board, is taking charge of the business until the investigation is com-plete. Pilkington denied market rumours that the FBI had been called in, saying that no 'outside agency' was involved in the investigation. The shares fell 5p to 128p with the market closing before Pilkington responded to the speculation. Pilkington stressed that the problem did not involve 'a major financial loss' and said LOF's customers and operations were not affected. Pilkington bought LOF in April 1986 and in 1989 sold a 20 per cent stake to Nippon Sheet Glass. In the 1991-92 year, LOF contributed Pounds 511.5m to group turnover of Pounds 2.6bn, and operating profits of Pounds 10.8m out of Pounds 182.5m.</p>

			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Republic of Slovenia (5): An awkward period - Banking THESE are tough times for Slovenia's banks. They are tough because the banking system has inherited a peculiarity of the Yugoslav federal banking system in which enterprises could establish their own banks. In doing so, the enterprise managers could simultaneously be represented on the board of their banks. The result was that the local bank manager could issue credit to his or her own enterprise. There was little or no accountability. The banking system was devoid of checks and balances. In late 1989, the Yugoslav federal government, then headed by Mr Ante Markovic, attempted to start a process of restructuring which was aimed at breaking the incestuous relationship between the banks and enterprises. But there were too many interests at stake in cutting off credits lines from the enterprises. Enterprises were in no position to stand on their own feet without credits. Moreover, they had been spoiled by soft budget constraints, consisting often of 'soft' loans extended by the banks to the enterprises, as well as inter-enterprise loans. Any immediate axeing of the credit lines would lead to insolvency, bankruptcy and more unemployment. Against this background, Slovenia's banks are now in the process of restructuring. It is not going to be easy because the republic's banks, in particular, the Ljubljanska Bank, is saddled with bad debts. This is because it largely monopolised the republic's banking system. About 60 per cent of all enterprise loans are on the bank's books at its headquarters in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, and when its dozen or so subsidiaries are taken into account, the Ljubljanska Bank network holds between 80 per cent and 90 per cent of the republic's enterprise loans. 'What else would you expect when this bank had the monopoly,' said Mr Marko Kranjec, former finance minister and now the vice-governor of the republic's central bank, who believes in implementing a tight monetary policy. 'However, this does not mean that the Ljubljanska Bank is 90 per cent contaminated. It is in bad shape. But the bank can obtain credit lines without problems. Throughout the republic, we have only one illiquid bank. In fact, most of the banks will be able to survive,' he added. It is difficult to gauge the precise figure for non-performing loans because loans are divided into five categories: normal loans repayable within a few days; loans payable within 60 days; loans payable between 60 and 180 days; loans payable between 180 days and one year; and those loans which exceed one year. However, banks officials reckons that non-performing loans exceed DM1bn  - and that is excluding inter-enterprise loans and other means of financing to the enterprises. The questions now preoccupying Slovene bankers are how the banks can be restructured and how enterprises can start exercising financial discipline. Mr Stanislav Valant, assistant managing director of the Ljubljanska Bank, describes restructuring as 'a long process.' 'Some enterprises started to restructure two years ago when they saw how the political developments were going to affect their exports to other parts of Yugoslavia. Then there are others who are involved in debt-equity swaps. It is a case-by-case process,' he said. But like Mr Kranjec, Mr Valant believes that the board of directors of banks must no longer be net debtors. 'The relationship between enterprises and banks has to be changed. The legislation exists. It just has to be implemented,' said Mr Valant. Mr Valant sees the problem of restructuring the banks in terms of a transition. Because there has been no financial discipline to speak of, and because there are no financial institutions in place such as pension and investment funds, so as to provide additional sources of financing, the rug cannot be pulled from under the feet of the enterprises overnight. If most of the banks are burdened with non-performing loans, there is another problem facing the banks, namely the claims against the National Bank of Yugoslavia (NBY), which is based in Belgrade, the federal capital and capital of the republic of Serbia. In the past, any foreign exchange deposits made by Slovenes to the banks in Slovenia were transferred to the NBY. Most of the deposits of Slovene citizens, which exceed Dollars 1.2bn, had been originally placed in the Ljubljanska Bank. Because of Slovenia's declaration of independence - which Serbia and the NBY opposed - the NBY's (and Serbia's) desperate need for foreign exchange reserves, and Belgrade's unwillingness to open up negotiations with Slovenia on the question of foreign exchange deposit accounts, the NBY has not released these deposits to Slovenia. As a result, the deposits have remained technically frozen although some economists in Slovenia believe the deposits have been spent. A similar picture exists for those foreign exchange deposits held by Croat citizens in the Ljubljanska Bank in Zagreb, capital of neighbouring Croatia. They amount to Dollars 454m. Mr Valant says the banks' claims against the NBY will probably be purchased by the Slovene government. 'The Slovene government will have to negotiate these claims and, probably, the Slovene government will guarantee these deposits. The Prime Minister (Mr Lojze Peterle) said the government would issue a letter of intent and would purchase those loans from us,' said Mr Valant. Were this to happen, he believes public confidence in the banking system in Slovenia would be fully restored.</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: UBS Union Bank of Switzerland's board is still on probation. The narrowness of its proxy battle victory suggests that arguments put forward by Mr Martin Ebner, UBS's largest shareholder, struck a chord with some other investors. Mr Ebner may not have produced a compelling blueprint for how the bank should be run. But he was right to prod it to improve its returns. Now that the distinction between registered and bearer shares is to be abolished, the effective premium enjoyed by the former should shrink - unless Mr Ebner's legal challenge proves successful, that is. The bearer shares may also tumble. By most yardsticks, UBS is expensive relative to other Swiss and European banks. Unless the board is provoked by the narrowness of its victory to sweat its capital harder, the premium rating will be unjustified.</p>

			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Citicorp to sell Arizona branches and assets CITICORP, the largest US commercial bank, yesterday said it had agreed to sell to Norwest, a regional US banking group, 59 branches and most of its assets in Arizona. Citicorp said the sale of the branches, Dollars 2bn of deposits and Dollars 2.3bn of assets in Arizona was the result of an evaluation which determined that owning Citibank Arizona was no longer strategically necess-ary. Terms of the trans-action were not disclosed, but the bank said the deal would have 'no mater-ial financial impact.' Citicorp did say it would take some 'modest write-offs' as a result of the deal. The Arizona interests, once part of Citicorp's ambition to develop holdings across the US, were bought by Citicorp in two stages in 1986 and 1988. In 1988, Citicorp acquired assets from the United Bank of Arizona from Standard Chartered Bank of the UK for between Dollars 200m and Dollars 250m. Citibank of Arizona, based in Phoenix, is engaged in retail and community banking activities.</p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Letter: Relational contracts are a matter of culture Sir, As a consultant on negotiation to several banks and corporations, I agree with the thrust of Professor John Kay's article on 'relational contracts' ('The unwritten code of lasting business', March 29). Two points require comment. Firstly, Prof Kay says that 'UK banks were ready to discard such (relational) contracts with their customers . . . in the pursuit of a more commercial, performance-oriented transactional style of business'. The banks were not the only parties pushing in the transactional direction. Many companies, particularly the larger ones, have been out bargain-hunting for financial services, playing the banks off against each other and using their buying-power to get the best deals. It is not difficult to characterise this as cut-throat short-termism, but there is surely merit in questioning what may have become over-easy relationships. Secondly, Prof Kay rightly points out that, while relational contracts can yield competitive advantage, 'each party is exposed to the risk of opportunistic behaviour by the other'. There is an implication that the risk is equal on both sides; but in many cases the relationship is far from equal. Big firms are buying from minnows, who live in constant fear that the big fish will turn out to be sharks. Part of the problem here is the frequent mismatch between company policies and behaviour on the ground. The official corporate philosophy may be to establish mutually beneficial, long-term 'win-win' relationships with suppliers. But individual buyers frequently regard this as so much flannel. This is hardly surprising when buyers are judged by the level of discount they achieve or by margin improvement. Nor should the big fish be surprised if the small fry seem sceptical about their real intentions. The moral is that big companies need to work harder at achieving consistency in the messages they send within their organisations. Prof Kay is certainly right in pointing to the cultural aspects of relational contracting. I imagine he would agree that it is a matter of corporate, as well as national, culture.

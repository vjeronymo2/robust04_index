			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Arts: Montreal musicians - London has been playing host to distinguished foreign orchestras and singers. Our critics report Charles Dutoit and the Orchestre symphonique de Montreal rounded off their latest European tour at the Royal Festival Hall on Wednesday night. Any appearance here by this first-rate ensemble is an event: despite several tours to these shores, Dutoit and the orchestra (he has been musical director since since 1977) remain best known on this side of the Atlantic for their superb series of Decca recordings. Their 13-city tour took them to most European musical centres - including the homes of their Vienna and Berlin rivals - and as far afield as Ljubljana and Warsaw. Even though this London performance followed straight on from two consecutive nights in Poland, the players showed no sign of fatigue. Indeed, what sets the Montreal orchestra apart is the poise and precision of its playing. It is not remarkable for an idiosyncratic sound, rather for performing as one instrument, with articulation rare in such a big band. Dutoit is a flexible but authoritative conductor. His obvious rapport with the players was clear from the invigorating performance that opened the evening, Stravinsky's Jeu de Cartes, a ballet score written for Balanchine. All the acerbic wit came across with bracing clarity, but Dutoit also made every quirky note entrancing and beautiful. Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 25 in C, K. 503, was luminous, with the internal balance carefully judged. The orchestra had an equal partner in the masterful Stephen Kovacevich, who tempered the work's majesty with humour and pathos; only in the slow movement did a certain emotional depth elude the players. The orchestra was on its most familiar territory in the second half. Dutoit conjured up a swirling, seductive performance of Debussy's Iberia, the middle movement ('Les parfums de la nuit') sultry, the outer movements fiery, painted with vibrant brush strokes. Ravel's La Valse is a good orchestral showpiece - Dutoit set atmospheric pianissimos against great surges of sound - but it seldom sounds as heady and exhilarating as it did here.

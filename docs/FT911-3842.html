			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: Institutions attempt to install new management at Budgens - Board considering a number of options for future A GROUP of institutional shareholders is attempting to remove Mr John Fletcher as chairman of Budgens and install a new management team at the troubled grocery chain. IEP Securities, Electra Investment Trust, and Gartmore Investment Trust, which together hold 27 per cent of the shares, have put a proposal to the board 'concerning the future direction of the company'. This is understood to involve the appointment of three new directors including Mr John von Spreckelsen, and two associates, Mr Christian Williams and Mr Graham Rigby. Mr von Spreckelsen is credited with having rejuvenated KAFU-Wasmund Handelsgesellschaft, a supermarket chain which is based in Bremen, Germany. The group's proposal is said to be 'under active consideration' by the Budgens' board although the company stated that it was also reviewing a number of other options for developing the business. In recent years, Budgens has recorded poor results having suffered from high borrowings and the disruption caused by setting up a new distribution centre. Yesterday one analyst described the performance of the company as 'utterly disastrous'. Earlier this year, the company announced a severe drop in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.71m to Pounds 505,000 and analysts suggested it might only make Pounds 1.5m in the full year. Budgens, formerly known as Barker &amp; Dobson, runs a chain of 95 neighbourhood grocery stores. It has faced stiff competition from Marks and Spencer and is seen as being under further threat as J Sainsbury and Tesco again express interest in developing their high street outlets. Mr Fletcher, who became chairman and chief executive of Budgens in 1985, failed to consummate a planned merger with Wm Low, the Scottish-based supermarket chain, in 1989. This followed a highly ambitious but ultimately abortive attempt to buy Dee Corporation for Pounds 2bn. Budgens has recently strengthened its board through the appointment of Mr Derek Pretty as finance director in December 1989 and Mr Keith Clarke as managing director in April 1990. Budgens' shares, which have fallen sharply during the past two years, closed 2p higher yesterday at 47p.</p>

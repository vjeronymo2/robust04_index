			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Golden Vale sees turnover of IPounds 500m Golden Vale, the County Cork-based dairy products company, reported pre-tax profits of IPounds 9.14m (Pounds 8.64m) for the six months to June 30, against IPounds 7.75m. Turnover advanced from IPounds 155.8m to IPounds 184.5m reflecting the inclusion of Dairy Produce Packers for the first time. The figures do not include three large purchases announced in the period, Leckpatrick, 33 per cent of A/S Vejle Margarinefabrik in Denmark and the ongoing acquisition of Vonk in the Netherlands and Poland. The company said that by next year it expected turnover to be about IPounds 500m. In the first half there were increases in volumes in dairy spreads, processed cheese and industrial sales whereas sales of primary products continued to decline as a result of the company's ongoing strategy. Net interest payable fell to IPounds 890,000 (IPounds 956,000). The company said there was a significant reduction in interest on core borrowings but this was offset by the inclusion of DPP borrowings. Earnings per share were 4.66p (4.35p). The interim dividend is raised to 0.6p (0.5p).</p>

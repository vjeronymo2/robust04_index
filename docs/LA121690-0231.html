			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUSTICE IN DISTRESS: A SPECIAL REPORT;  </P> <P> A TRIP THROUGH THE SYSTEM  </P> <P> Arrests and Bookings  </P> <P> 1. A trip through the labyrinth of criminal justice in Los Angeles begins when  an arrestee is "booked" -- a process in which he is fingerprinted, photographed  and jailed. By law, a suspect in California can be held no longer than 48 hours  without being formally accused in court of having committed a crime. That  leaves the police two days, excluding weekends, to prepare and present their  case to either the City Attorney or District Attorney for possible prosecution.  </P> <P> * Misdemeanors, usually punishable by no more than a year in county jail, are  submited to the City Attorney.  </P> <P> * Felonies, more serious crimes that carry possible prison terms, are  prosecuted by the District Attorney.  </P> <P> * Some crimes known as "wobblers" can be tried as either felonies or  misdemeanors.  </P> <P> Hearings and Trials  </P> <P> 2. If prosecutors decline to file charges, the suspect is usually freed  immediately. But if charges are filed, the suspect becomes a "defendant" and is  "arraigned" in municipal court, where he is formally told of the accusations  against him. A "preliminary hearing" then is scheduled and normally held within  10 working days.  </P> <P> During the preliminary hearing, a municipal court judge hears evidence from the  prosecution and defense, then decides whether there is sufficient reason to  believe that the defendant is guilty of a crime. If the judge decides there is  insufficient evidence, the defendant is released. More often, judges finds in  favor of "the people" or prosecution, and the matter is "set for trial."  </P> <P> Defendants are legally entitled to a "speedy trial." In misdemeanors, the trial  must begin within 45 days of arraignment, if the defendant has been released on  bail or on his "own recognizance." If the defendant has remained in custody  after being arrested, the trial must begin within 30 days.  </P> <P> All felony trials must begin within 60 days of arraignment in Superior Court.  </P> <P> Defendants in both misdemeanor and felony proceedings often "waive time,"  meaning they agree to postpone trial to give their attorneys more time to  prepare a defense. Far more plead guilty and avoid trial in exchange for  lighter sentences -- a process known as "plea bargaining."  </P> <P> Serving Time  </P> <P> 3. JAIL: Because of overcrowding, defendants committed to Los Angeles County  jails serve less than half of their court-ordered sentences. With various  credits given to each inmate, a maximum one-year sentence translates to 155  days.  </P> <P> PRISON: Except for murderers and others who receive life sentences, convicted  felons sent to state prison since 1976 have served what are known as  "determinate" sentences. A judge imposes the low, mid-term or high term  prescribed by state law. Sale of cocaine, for example, carries a minimum  punishment of three years, a mid-term of four years, and a maximum of five  years. A prisoner who does not cause trouble and agrees to work while in  custody is rewarded with having his sentence reduced by one day for every day  he serves. A three-year term in prison typically is reduced to about 1 1/2  years.  </P> <P> Release  </P> <P> 4. FROM JAIL: When jail inmates are released, nearly all are placed on  probation, typically for one-to-three years. In that time, they must abide by  certain rules and regulations or run the risk of being locked up again. Most  are put on "formal" or supervised probation, in which probation officers are  supposed to monitor their behavior.  </P> <P> FROM PRISON: When a prison inmate is released, he is placed on "parole" and  must answer to a state agent. If he does not behave himself, he can be returned  to prison for as much as one year for every parole violation.  </P></p>

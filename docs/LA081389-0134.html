The girl told  authorities that six to eight men taunted her during the assault and made  comments such as "when's it going to be our turn?" Singer David James Parker,  26, and band technician Gary Chris Saunders, 22, both of New York, and  bodyguard Christopher Elias Tsipouras, 26, of Union, N.J., were charged Friday  with first-degree criminal sexual conduct. LL Cool J, whose real name is James  Todd Smith, was not involved in the incident after Wednesday night's concert,  police said. LL Cool J, short for Ladies Love Cool James, is among the best  known rappers.  </P></p>

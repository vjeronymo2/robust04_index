			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters opposed the proposed tabular format, asserting that funds should have the flexibility to present the information in other formats. The Commission believes that the tabular format affords ample flexibility for funds to present the information they believe is important, while providing the advantages of a uniform format. The Commission is adopting the proposed item with one change from the proposal: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the summary table requirement, as adopted, also applies to proxy statements for multiple class funds containing multiple proposals affecting different classes. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Subparagraph (a)(3)(ii) of item 22. The table would not be required if the proxy statement solicits a vote or votes on the same proposal or proposals from all fund or series shareholders. To assure that shareholders are not confused in casting their vote, a separate proxy card is required for each fund, portfolio, or class.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Multiple class funds issue more than one class of securities, with each class typically subject to a different distribution arrangement, but representing interests in the same portfolio of investments. Currently, funds must obtain exemptive orders to implement these type of arrangements. The Commission recently proposed rule and form amendments that would permit a fund to issue multiple classes of securities without the need for an exemptive order. Investment Company Act Rel. No. 19955 (Dec. 16, 1993) [58 FR 68074 (Dec. 23, 1993)].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission proposed in paragraph (a) of item 22 definitions for certain terms used in item 22. The definitions are adopted substantially as proposed with some modifications to reflect comments on the scope of two of the definitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, the definition of ``fund complex'' has been modified. The proposed amendments would require disclosure of certain information if a fund director serves as director of more than one fund in a ``fund complex,'' including, for example, the aggregate compensation paid to a director who serves on a number of boards in a fund complex. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As proposed, item 22(a) defined a ``fund complex'' as two or more funds with a common investment adviser (or which have advisers that are affiliates) or, with respect to open-end funds, a common principal underwriter. The Proposing Release requested comment on whether the definition should include groups of funds with common administrators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See infra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  section I.D. The term ``fund complex'' also is used with respect to disclosure of other directorships of a director.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See infra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 23 and accompanying text.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes it is important to define fund complex in a manner that will result in disclosure of information about directors (particularly concerning compensation) serving on the boards of related funds. As some commenters pointed out, many funds may have common principal underwriters or administrators that solely provide services to the fund but are otherwise not associated with the fund, and therefore would not be commonly understood to be part of a group of related funds. Other similar definitions of ``group'' or ``family'' of investment companies address this issue by specifying that the funds hold themselves out to investors as related companies for the purposes of investment and investor services, in addition to sharing a principal underwriter. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission has decided to define fund complex as two or more funds that hold themselves out to investors as related companies or that have a common investment adviser. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission believes the information about directors on the boards of funds that are marketed to investors as related funds (regardless of whether they have a common principal underwriter or administrator) is important to shareholders. In addition, the Commission believes that an investment adviser typically has such an important role in a fund's activities that the definition of fund complex should include funds with common investment advisers regardless of whether the funds hold themselves out as related companies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 11a-3 [17 CFR 270.11a-3] under the 1940 Act (``group of investment companies'') and General Instruction H to Form N-SAR [17 CFR 274.101], which is the semi-annual reporting form for funds (``family of investment companies'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Subparagraph (a)(1)(v) of item 22.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

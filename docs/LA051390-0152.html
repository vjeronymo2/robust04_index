			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> COUPLES' 75 LETS NORMAN AND STEWART THROUGH  </P> <P> Greg Norman came back from a long rain delay to finish a three-under-par 69 and  took a one-stroke lead when Fred Couples botched the final hole in Saturday's  third round of the Memorial tournament at Dublin, Ohio.  </P> <P> Couples, who led through the first two rounds of this weather-troubled  tournament, held a share of the top spot when he went to the 18th tee in the  gathering twilight.  </P> <P> As the last player on the course, Couples hooked his drive into a little creek,  had to take a drop and went on to a double-bogey six.  </P> <P> It finished a three-over-par 75 that dropped him two strokes off the pace with  one round to go.  </P> <P> Norman completed three rounds at even-par 216 and was long gone from Jack  Nicklaus' Muirfield Village Golf Club course when Couples finished in a cold  rain.  </P> <P> Norman didn't know he would end up as the 54-hole leader when he said he  "wasn't real happy with the way I played. I didn't really play that well on the  back," although that's where he made up eight shots on Couples.  </P> <P> With Couples' last-hole collapse, Payne Stewart took over second place at 217  after shooting a 69 in a tournament that was raked by gale-force winds  Thursday, then subjected to cold, steady rain that caused a 2-hour, 10-minute  delay Saturday.  </P> <P> Stewart, who has won two of his last three starts, hopes he will have another  chance to make up some ground.  </P> <P> "I was trying to get up there around the lead, get the lead, because there's a  definite possibility the golf tournament can be rained out, canceled tomorrow,"  he said. "All I can do is hope we can play tomorrow."  </P> <P> The forecast was for continued rain through this morning.  </P> <P> Couples, who lost four shots to par over the last five holes and played the  back nine in 41, dropped into a tie for third at 218 with Don Pooley, Brad  Faxon and Mark Brooks.  </P> <P> Pooley, the 1987 winner of this event, had a 74. Brooks and Faxon each matched  par 72.  </P> <P> Peter Jacobsen (71) and Bill Sander (72) were at 219.  </P> <P> Terry Dill sank a 40-foot eagle putt on the 18th hole to take a two-stroke lead  over Mike Hill after the second round of the Southwestern Bell tournament at  Oklahoma City.  </P> <P> Dill's three-under 69 left him at 139 and put him in position to win his first  PGA Senior Tour championship today -- his 51st birthday.  </P> <P> "I didn't hit the ball nearly as well today as I did yesterday, but I hit a lot  of good shots," said Dill, a former law professor who has won $122,000 since  joining the Senior Tour last year.  </P> <P> Hill, the second-leading money winner this year, had six birdies and three  bogeys in a round of 69. He is virtually assured of finishing in the top 10 for  the eighth time in 10 starts this year.  </P> <P> Dottie Mochrie shot a career-low 65 to take a seven-shot lead after the second  round of the LPGA Crestar tournament at Chesapeake, Va.  </P> <P> Her seven-under-par round gave her a total of 132 and the largest second-round  lead of the year on the tour.  </P> <P> Rosie Jones was second at 139 after shooting a 70, with Chris Johnson (67)  another stroke back.  </P> <P> Patty Sheehan shot a 71 and was tied with Deb Richard and Vicki Fergon at 141.  Richard shot 69 Saturday. Fergon had a 71.  </P></p>

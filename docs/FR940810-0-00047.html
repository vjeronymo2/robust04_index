			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this final rule, based upon the record evidence, OSHA is adopting certain regulatory recommendations made in the earlier rulemaking, is rejecting other recommendations, and is issuing other provisions which are based on, but are altered versions of yet other recommendations in the earlier rulemaking. In addition, new, different and expanded provisions also have been urged for adoption by participants in this rulemaking. These participants represent labor, public interest and industry interests. The Agency is adopting, rejecting and changing these recommendations as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A large portion of this preamble is devoted to the Agency's explanations of these regulatory decisions. OSHA believes that its reasons when it has adopted or has not adopted recommended provisions are well supported by the evidence and that the reasons for its choices are stronger than the contrary arguments. In general, OSHA believes that the extent of its burden to refute claims of benefit for a recommended provision depends on the extent of the supporting data. If the data are valid and extensive, OSHA's burden is greater. If however, the claim of benefit is based on opinion, refutation by OSHA need not be grounded in data, but may be based on OSHA's well reasoned and expert contrary opinion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In sum, OSHA's decision not to adopt recommended provisions to reduce asbestos related risk reflects the Agency's expert judgment, often where available data creates considerable uncertainty, that the provisions would not offer more than de minimis benefit in reducing a still significant risk. Many recommendations were unsupported by data showing benefit. For example, it was recommended to prohibit high speed burnishing of asbestos-containing floor tile. However, the data do not show a measurable reduction of airborne asbestos fiber levels, based on actual fiber counts using such practices. Other recommended provisions simply do not reduce a still significant risk. For example, requiring very low clearance samples (analyzed by transmission electron microscopy) to deregulate all ``regulated areas'' to assure that EPA/AHERA level of 0.01 f/cc is met does not appear to be necessary to reduce a significant risk to employees. There is an extremely low (although speculative) risk of asbestos related disease estimated at such clearance levels, and, there is evidence that immediate clearance sampling does not predict later concentration levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA discusses the recommendations made by participants in the preamble sections which cover the recommended provisions. The following is a list of the major recommendations made by public which are discussed later:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Recommendations for a mandatory building inspection program: Recommended by BCTD (Ex. 143, Att. A); Gobbell Hays Partners, Inc. (7&hyph;149), Service Employees International Union (SEIU) (Ex. 144);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, (AFSCME, Ex. 141); ORC, or assume it is asbestos (Ex. 145), SBA, limited to employers whose work duties involve contact with ACM shall assure that all ACM in workplace is identified, need not inspect building areas constructed since 1980.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Mandatory notification to OSHA by employers of all removal, renovation, and abatement work: Recommended by BCTD, (Ex. 143, Att. A at 3), The Courdith-Roberts Group, (L7&hyph;185); Gobbell Hays Partners, Inc. (7&hyph;149).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Mandatory use of negative pressure enclosures in regulated areas, except for small-scale, short-duration operations and other limited circumstances: Recommended by BCTD, (Ex. 143 Att A at 5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Mandatory procedures for deregulating regulated areas including mandatory clearance sampling. Recommended by BCTD, (Ex. 143, Att. A at 6); AFSCME (Ex. 141).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. OSHA accreditation of training and OSHA designated detailed training curricula. Recommended by BCTD (Ex. 143 Att. A at 8)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

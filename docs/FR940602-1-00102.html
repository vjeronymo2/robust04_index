			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the last item in this section of Appendix I, EPA is proposing to move existing item L.7.d. to L.8.e. This item describes revising the final operating conditions to reflect the results of the trial burn. Changes in the final permit should reflect the operating conditions under which the facility met the required performance standards during the trial burn. EPA does not propose changes to the wording of this item.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Requirements Regarding the Trial Burn  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Purpose and Applicability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purposes of this section of the proposed rule are (1) to make the permitting procedural requirements for interim status combustion units more equivalent to current permitting requirements for new units, particularly with regard to trial burns, and (2) to clarify some administrative permitting procedures for combustion units. In addition, this section contains proposed requirements that will provide for more public involvement opportunities, both earlier in the combustion permitting process and at key points throughout the process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirements in this section apply only to combustion units at both interim status and permitted facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Summary of Proposed Approach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing today to create a new &sect;270.74, which will contain permitting procedural requirements for interim status combustion units. This proposed new section is a consolidation of &sect;&sect;270.62(d) and 270.66(g), which currently contain permitting procedural requirements for interim status incinerators and BIFs, respectively. Proposed &sect;270.74 is virtually identical to &sect;&sect;270.62(d) and 270.66(g), except where EPA is proposing additional permitting procedural requirements for interim status units. EPA intends the additional requirements to make the procedural requirements for interim status units more equivalent to the permitting procedural requirements for new units, and to expand public involvement opportunities during the trial burn phase. The flow chart shown in Figure 2 indicates the points in the permitting process where the proposed activities would occur. For instance, the administrative procedural changes EPA is proposing in &sect;270.74 will require interim status facilities to submit a trial burn plan with their initial Part B applications. Section 270.74 further states that the permitting agency must approve the trial burn plan before the facility conducts the trial burn. These proposed explicit requirements will ensure that interim status facilities conduct trial burns in accordance with approved plans, as do permitted facilities, and do not perform the trial burns before submitting their applications. In another permitting procedural change, EPA proposes to clarify the Director's authority to allow additional trial burns and to deny a permit to an interim status unit if the Director does not believe that the unit is capable of meeting performance standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4725 -->  <IMPORT>  <!-- PJG importformat s,d639 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> E:GraphicsEP02jn94.003 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </IMPORT>  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;C <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing a new regulatory requirement, not addressed in previous regulations, which pertains to post-trial burn conditions at interim status combustion facilities. EPA is proposing that, upon completion of the trial burn, interim status facilities must operate only under conditions that passed and were demonstrated to meet the performance standards of &sect;264.343 (for incinerators) or &sect;&sect;266.104 through 266.107 (for BIFs), and only if the successful trial burn data are sufficient to set all applicable operating conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Concerning public involvement, the Agency is proposing additional public participation opportunities in the combustion permitting process by requiring public notices at key points in the trial burn process. The Agency would like to build on the public involvement requirements in today's proposed rule and expand them to the trial burn stage. The Agency believes that public involvement opportunities should continue beyond the initial permit application stage and throughout the permitting process. For instance, the proposed rule requires the permitting authority to give public notice of the actual trial burn for both interim status and new combustion facilities. It is important to inform the public of the pending burn and give members of the public an opportunity to participate in this later phase of the permitting process. As mentioned previously in the public involvement segment of the preamble, expanded public participation in the RCRA program and decision-making process is a high priority for the Agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

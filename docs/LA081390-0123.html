			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> LUCAS LOOKS AT TUSKEGEE AIRMEN  </P> <P> George Lucas, creator of the "Star Wars" and "Indiana Jones" movie series, is  planning a film about the Tuskegee Airmen, the famed all-black World War II  fighter squadron.  </P> <P> The story of "Red Tails," named for the red paint found on the squadron's  planes, will be the first in a long-term deal Lucas plans to cut with a studio  yet to be determined.  </P> <P> "I'm sure to encounter resistance," he said. "But I'm one of the few people who  can get this film made. I see the movie less as a race picture than as an  aerial action-adventure. 'Top Gun' proved there's an audience for that."  </P> <P> The Tuskegee Airmen, formed from a select group of 926 blacks trained at  Alabama's Tuskegee Army Flying School, was created after the Army Air Corps was  ordered by Congress to lift a color ban in 1940.  </P> <P> The squadron flew 1,578 support missions from bases in North Africa and Europe  without losing a single bomber to enemy fire.  </P> <P> "Red Tails" also will focus on the pilots' lives once they returned to civilian  life, only to face continued racism and segregation, screenwriter Kevin  Sullivan said.  </P> <P> "Overnight, they went from heroes to second-class citizens," Sullivan said.  "It's a story that somehow got lost in our history," he said.  </P></p>

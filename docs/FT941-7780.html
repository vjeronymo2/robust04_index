			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Shake-up costs limit Unilever profit Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and detergents group, has launched a restructuring programme costing Pounds 490m worldwide over the next three years. The programme will lead to 7,500 job losses, of which up to 1,000 could come in the UK. The annual savings would amount to about Pounds 240m, Unilever said. However, the charge pulled down full-year profits to Pounds 1.94bn before tax, a fall of 4 per cent. In underlying terms, profits were up 11 per cent, half the rise being due to the weakness of sterling. The cost-cutting is further evidence of the pressures felt by branded goods manufacturers in the developed world. Last July Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever's dominant competitor in the US, took a charge of Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1.02bn) to cover 13,000 job losses and the closure of 30 factories. Unilever chairman Sir Michael Perry said two-thirds of the restructuring charge would be a cash cost, the rest being the write-off of plant. Over the past five years, he said, Unilever had spent some Pounds 600m on restructuring. The same underlying rate of spending was likely to continue. But the strength of the business allowed an acceleration of the programme at present. Unilever's last big restructuring exercise was launched three years ago in preparation for the European single market, at a cost of Pounds 305m. The programme, now three-quarters complete, was producing annual savings of some Pounds 150m, the company said. This time the blow will be heavier in the US, where Unilever has been badly buffeted in detergents wars with Procter &amp; Gamble. Of the total cost, 37 per cent will be incurred in north America and 57 per cent in Europe, still Unilever's biggest field of operations. Sir Michael played down suggestions that branded goods were coming under pressure from low-cost competition in the US and Europe. Most comment on the subject had been over the top, he said. While Unilever had been forced in the UK to cut the price of its tea brands, this was an isolated example. The latest job losses amount to 2.5 per cent of the 300,000 workforce. However, Sir Michael said, this did not imply that the workforce was falling, since Unilever was also expanding in other markets. Despite the fall in earnings, the full year dividend was raised 17 per cent to 25.03p. The shares fell 38p to 1162p.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      RESTRUCTURING: THE DETAILS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Net charges:                    Pounds 490m after Pounds 518m costs and                                            Pounds 28m disposal proceeds Job losses:                            7,500 jobs out of Pounds 300,000 Operations affected:                        60 projects in 20 countries Annual savings:                          Pounds 240m within three years Worst hit:                                         detergents in the US  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Explanation:                      'Four years of recession in the major                                  economies have intensified competition                                  and made it imperative to operate with                                      the highest level of efficiency to                                     protect margins, hence the need for                                               restructuring every year'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Lex, Page 22; Details, Page 26</p>

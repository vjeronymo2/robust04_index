			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hideki Takabayashi: "Extraordinary Event in </F> Industry Cooperation--`Desperate Battle' of Auto Industry, Which  Presses Moribund Blast-Furnace Companies To Cut Prices"]    [Text] The steel industry has fallen into a crisis  situation, with major blast-furnace companies facing losses and  suspension of dividends. The auto industry, which has staked its  survival, is leveling demands at the steel industry for price  cuts. But behind that severity lies unexpected "understanding."    "The situation is that plant and equipment built for autos  is  not operating. Management of every steel company is suffering  because of that depreciation burden," "We have not once received  a guarantee from users saying `We will buy X number of vehicles  next year'"... This kind of offense and defense is being fought  between steel and autos.    Toshio Kokure, Kawasaki Steel Corporation vice president (in  charge of operations), was astonished at being pressed by the  president of a major auto company who said, "For vehicles which  emphasize price, like light cars, 80 percent of the steel can be  replaced by imported material."    At present, 100 percent of the steel used by the automakers  is procured from domestic blast-furnace companies. Since the  summer of last year, automakers have been requesting price cuts  on steel materials, against the background of a resolve that is  even prepared to reduce that.    The beginning was a revolt of companies that make auto  parts.  From 1992 into 1993 complaints gushed forth from parts makers:  "Why do we have to buy expensive domestic steel despite being  asked to lower costs by units of 1 yen and 1 sen?" No matter how  much parts makers push ahead with lowering of processing costs  by self-help efforts, it is very hard to make progress in  lowering costs if material costs, which account for about  one-half of all costs, do not become lower.    A system of "centralized procurement" of steel has been  established in the auto industry. It is a system by which  automakers also buy in one lot from steelmakers the steel used  by parts makers, and supply it to them. For the automakers, the  price was less by buying in one lot, and it was effective in  controlling their keiretsu; for the steelmakers, it had the  advantages of the number of companies to negotiate with being  reduced and of price and volume being stable.    But, starting the year before last, the market price became  less than the price of steel purchased in a centralized manner  and supplied to parts makers. For example, in contrast to the  fact that cold rolled steel could be purchased on the market for  about 65,000 yen per ton, the supply price was 90,000 yen, a big  gap.    The phenomenon of reversal had also occurred a number of  times in the past, but it was temporary and soon reverted to the  former state. The cause lay in disorder in the supply volume  among domestic producers, so it could be solved by adjustment  among steel companies, which are predisposed toward cooperation.  But the cause of the current drop in the market price was  imported steel, such as that made in South Korea. If it were a  domestic problem, "consultation" would operate. But it does not  happen that way when overseas entities are involved.    Automakers judged that "the price reversal is not a  temporary  phenomenon; it will continue in the future as well," so starting  last year they began asking steelmakers to lower prices.    Although this matter has not yet been settled, it worked out  that, beginning in April, auto companies lowered the price at  which they supply steel to parts makers by 5,000-7,000 yen.    Steelmakers say "it is a price between automakers and parts  makers, so it has nothing to do with a price reduction with us."  But, actually, there is a strong possibility that the  steelmakers' price for autos will also drop by about 5 percent.  <H5>  Automakers' Own Device Prevents Them From Reaping the </H5> Strong-Yen Benefit    Because of the strong yen since last year, automakers'  profits have declined by a total of about 1 trillion yen.  Therefore, they accelerated cost reduction, but they became  irritated by the fact that it is very difficult to restore  material that gains the strong-yen benefit. Steel is a typical  example of that.    However, the automakers' production system itself had  factors  which hinder reaping the strong-yen dividend. Japanese  manufacturers have adopted the just-in-time (JIT) production  system. Deliveries must be made a number of times each day at  established times. It is arranged that the storage and delivery  for that purpose are the role of the steelmakers. Even if the  auto companies tried to use imported steel, it would be  impossible in the present situation, in which there are no  overseas blast-furnace companies which employ a delivery system  which conforms to JIT.    Automakers also recognize this situation, so the question of  how much extra cost there is because of conforming to JIT has  become an issue in the negotiations on lowering of costs.    One more thing which stands in the way of imported steel is  the question of quality. Japanese cars use a lot of high-grade,  expensive steel, such as corrosion-resistant steel plate, which  does not rust easily; high-tensile steel plate, which is strong  and thin; and steel that can withstand complicated pressing.  Japanese blast-furnace companies have responded to automakers'  severe demands by this technology. One could not use imported  material for that kind of high-performance steel, even if one so  desired.    But the highest performance steel that is used in autos  accounts for about 40 percent. Aside from that, one can use  imported steel if one so wishes. Furthermore, in promoting the  inexpensive building of cars, automakers are trying to lower the  proportion of expensive steel that is used.    Japanese automakers bought Chrysler Neons, which appeared on  the market at a miraculously low price, and inspected them  thoroughly to find out why they can be made cheaply. Among other  things, they were also deeply impressed by the way of using  steel. Japanese cars have to use expensive steel because of  complicated surface design. In contrast to that, by making  curved surfaces gentle, so that they are easy to press, it has  been arranged that inexpensive grades of steel plate can be used  on the Neon.    At present Japanese automakers are competing fiercely in how  to make cars inexpensively. Therefore, means are being devised  by which even inexpensive steel will serve the purpose. If that  happens, it will mean that preparations will have been made for  being able to use imported material, or electric steel, which is  not used now because of unstable quality.  <H5>  Cooperation Crumbles Before Survival </H5>   Automakers are indebted to steelmakers for more than  development of technology. In order to increase the ratio of  local procurement for cars produced in the United States, they  replaced the steel which had been exported from Japan, with  products of U.S. blast-furnace companies that received  technology from Japanese blast-furnace companies. The drastic  reduction in steel exports is due in part to a ruling on  dumping, but it is said that "even if it had been an acquittal,  the reduction in exports would have been delayed by only one to  two years" (major auto company).    Moreover, the fact that parts makers extricated themselves  from centralized procurement because they were unable to endure  the price difference means that the amount purchased decreased,  so automakers' power to negotiate with steelmakers became  weaker. Because of these reasons, although the auto industry  pressed for price reductions, the pressure to lower prices is  weaker than that from such large-demand users as shipbuilding  and electrical appliances, which opened the door to imported  steel.    There is an understanding that 1) the lowering of prices  until they correspond to the international price will be done in  stages for the next three years, when restructuring of the steel  industry will progress; 2) the rate by which prices will be  lowered will be greater for low-grade steel and less for high  value-added steel, for which the cost of developing technology  has not been recovered; and 3) models up to the year 2000, when  depreciation of production plant and equipment will end, will  not cause rapid reduction in the use of high value-added steel.    Perhaps that is why an impression such as "I thought that in  negotiations on price cuts the auto industry deals with things  more reasonably than shipbuilding and so on, which seek drastic  price cuts" (Kawasaki Steel Corporation vice president Kokure)  leaked from the steel side.    The one exhibiting this kind of action which most  understands  the steel side is Toyota Motor Corporation, which is famous for  severity in lowering costs.    Behind this transformation lies the installation of Toyota's  chairman, Shoichiro Toyoda, as chairman of Keidanren (end of  May). One can easily imagine that it avoided a clash with the  steel industry, which up to now, as the representative of  industry, has produced any number of Keidanren chairmen. But to  judge this phenomenon as Toyota having come of age is too great  a leap of logic without going into the essence. It is being  demanded that Japanese business reform, from its closed nature  within Japan to internationalization, and from the cooperation  of collusion to rational competition. Can we not say that to  have chosen, in spite of that, to maintain a system of industry  cooperation and a doctrine of giving preference to the domestic  scene, is a compromise which sees only what is under its nose?    The price and system determined by negotiation between the  champions, Toyota and Nippon Steel Corporation, will probably  have a strong effect on both industries, just as up till now.  But that does not mean that the shakiness toward steel of lower  ranking automakers, whose operation is suffering, will have  ended. "From our standpoint, even the price cut that is soon to  be decided on will still not be low enough. It is also possible  that we will get imported material in the future. We have no  leeway to be considerate just because steel is having a hard  time" (Mitsubishi Motor Corporation executive director Shigeru  Nakagawa, who is also director of the Purchasing Division).    A person in charge of purchasing for an automaker says "We  are working with the feeling that the (currently existing) 11  automakers may not all survive. Unless we get the blast-furnace  companies to also think that the present six companies will not  necessarily all survive...."    Even if the two top companies, Toyota and Nippon Steel, try  to preserve the current setup, there is no doubt that it will  gradually crumble in the face of free competition.</p>

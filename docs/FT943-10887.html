			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Bank warns of need for rate rise: Government told underlying inflation may exceed 2.5% target in early 1996 The Bank of England yesterday warned that unless base rates are increased in the next few months the government could fail to meet its target of reducing underlying inflation to a 1-2.5 per cent range by the end of this parliament. In its quarterly inflation report, published yesterday, the Bank forecast that underlying retail price inflation, which excludes mortgage interest payments, would peak at over 3 per cent in the first quarter of 1996. The Bank, however, clearly signalled that there would be no rise in base rates, currently 5.25 per cent, before September 7 when its governor, Mr Eddie George, next meets Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer. The report acknowledged that inflation had been lower than the Bank had previously forecast and it also reduced the Bank's short-term outlook for underlying inflation. Speculation about an imminent base rate increase reached a peak last Friday, when the Bank accepted bids for Treasury bills at rates of up to 5.75 per cent. Yesterday, however, the money markets were relieved by the tone of the report. Short sterling, the futures market's means of speculating on interest rate changes, rose on the news, indicating a decline in expectations of an interest rate rise. The three-month interbank offered rate fell back to 5 9/16 per cent, from 5 3/4 per cent on Monday. No date has been chosen for a rate move but the Bank estimates the average lag between changes in rates and those of inflation at around two years. It would therefore have to tighten policy no later than the first quarter of next year if it were to bring underlying inflation below 2.5 per cent in the second quarter of 1997 - the latest date for the next general election. 'The stance of monetary policy must be set on the basis of a judgment of where inflation will be in some two years or so,' said the report. 'This is especially important at turning points in official interest rates.' The Bank added three more inflationary risks to the three outlined in its May inflation report - money supply growth, a rise in average earnings, and inflationary expectations in the financial markets. The report says that new dangers are recent rises in commodity prices, the prospect of a rebound in corporate profit margins and the risk that the economy is closer to its full growth potential than previously thought. The Bank warned that 'the pressures for higher inflation in the future may be building up even as the published inflation rate for the past continues to fall. It is possible, though not yet certain, that the United Kingdom is entering this phase'. Analysts said the arguments in the report would provide some useful ammunition for the governor if and when he tried to persuade the chancellor to increase base rates. Labour was quick to criticise the Bank's statement, claiming that a tightening of monetary policy would threaten economic recovery. Mr Nick Brown, a Labour Treasury spokesman, pointed out that UK short-term interest rates were already higher than in the US and Japan. 'On top of the biggest tax hike in history, and rising utility prices, homeowners can now expect a rise in mortgage rates, too,' he said. Mr Malcolm Bruce, the Liberal Democrats' new Treasury spokesman, said the authorities needed to raise rates now.

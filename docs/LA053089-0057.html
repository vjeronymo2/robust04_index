			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR VIETNAM VETERANS, OLD HOTEL IS A HEALING PLACE  </P> <P> On July 4, 1976, the night of the American Bicentennial, Vietnam veteran Bill  Leed drove his pickup truck onto the railroad tracks and headed toward the  white light of the oncoming train.  </P> <P> Leed had left Vietnam in 1969, a decorated combat veteran, but for the next  seven years he kept his war record a secret. He burned his uniform. He did not  tell friends he had been in the service. He tried to bury all thoughts about  Vietnam.  </P> <P> But the patriotic fervor of the Bicentennial celebration, the drinking and the  fireworks, brought back many painful memories. That night he headed for the  train, "because I couldn't take it anymore . . . all this anger I had at my  country, all these problems I had got totally out of control."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hitting Bottom  </P> <P> He ended up parking on the tracks and hopping out just before the train  obliterated his truck, but his life "bottomed out" after that July 4. He became  an alcoholic and a drug addict. He could not hold a job. He served time in  jail. Finally, like tens of thousands of other Vietnam combat veterans, Leed  became homeless.  </P> <P> But while many others have nowhere to turn but the local rescue mission, Leed  heard about a shelter for homeless Vietnam veterans in Santa Barbara, the only  one of its kind in the country, according to the local Veterans Administration.  </P> <P> Last month, Leed, 40, was living in an abandoned trailer and drinking heavily.  Today he is sober, living in a renovated hotel with other Vietnam veterans and  working for the city's parks department.  </P> <P> "I used to drink myself into oblivion to feel some sense of safety," Leed said.  "But I feel safe here, like a tremendous burden has been lifted off my  shoulders. There's a lot of people around here who know what I'm going through,  who I can ask for help."  </P> <P> The nonprofit hotel, which opened earlier this month, is operated by the Santa  Barbara chapter of the Vietnam Veterans of America. John Darlington, president  of the local VVA, said projects like the hotel can redress some of the wrongs  Vietnam veterans have endured during the last two decades.  </P> <P> "In some ways, programs like this are 20 years too late," said Darlington, who  manages the hotel. "Guys left Vietnam changed forever, but society didn't give  a damn. Because so many weren't helped then, we're seeing them on the streets  now."  </P> <P> Shortly after Vietnam veterans returned home, the American public began hearing  about the "flipouts and arrests" of maladjusted veterans, Darlington said. Then  came reports of alcoholism, drug abuse and mental disorders.  </P> <P> Now the problem of homeless veterans is finally being recognized, Darlington  said. About one third of all homeless people are veterans, with Vietnam-era  veterans making up the largest single group, national studies indicate.  </P> <P> "Some of the veterans have had the whole range of problems and ended up on the  streets, but this is where we want to stop it," said Darlington. "We've lost  two members of the VVA in the last year to suicide. We don't want to lose any  more."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reaction to Trauma  </P> <P> There are a handful of homeless shelters for Vietnam veterans throughout the  country, but the Santa Barbara program is the only one designed for veterans  suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, said Denver Mills, director of  the local Veterans Administration center.  </P> <P> The disorder is a delayed emotional reaction to the trauma of combat and  symptoms include flashbacks, nightmares, emotional numbing, panic and  depression. Many with the disorder also have histories of alcohol and drug  abuse.  </P> <P> Although most of those who served during the Vietnam era have long ago  readjusted to civilian life, a significant number are still struggling. Vietnam  combat veterans are widely believed to suffer from higher psychological  casualty rates than in any other modern American war, said Jack Crane, head of  the Homeless Veterans Project, a local referral and service group.  </P> <P> The soldiers in Vietnam were younger than American veterans of other modern  wars, Crane said, faced a higher percentage of combat situations, were forced  to fight a guerrilla war and had little time to adjust to civilian life.  </P> <P> Residents of the Santa Barbara hotel receive counseling for stress disorder or  drug and alcohol problems. Those with serious substance abuse problems can be  treated at VA hospitals and then return to the hotel. Job counseling and  referrals are provided by a variety of local agencies.  </P> <P> "We've found that homeless veterans seem to fare better when they're living  with other veterans than those who live alone," Crane said. "There's a certain  healing process for them in that community life."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Landmark Saved  </P> <P> The program is a success on many levels. In addition to aiding the veterans, an  important architectural landmark was preserved. The hotel where the men live is  not just another grim downtown shelter. Designated by the city as a "structure  of merit," the Hotel de Riviera, built in 1915, is a quaint redwood and stone  structure with large bay windows looking out onto rose gardens, winding stone  pathways and arbors covered with bougainvillea.  </P> <P> When the property was offered for sale last year, many local residents feared  for the future of the landmark hotel. But this is a city that has a tradition  of architectural preservation. The Santa Barbara Community Housing Corp. raised  enough local, state and private funds to purchase the hotel and then leased it  to the VVA.  </P> <P> Residents, who are accustomed to sleeping in bushes or on cots at rescue  missions, say they appreciate the landscaped gardens and elegant environs of  the hotel.  </P> <P> "This ain't some flophouse," Leed said. "It feels like home."  </P> <P> Leed, like many veterans at the hotel, adjusted fairly well immediately after  leaving the Army, but years later began having problems related to his Vietnam  experience. Leed, who earned eight Air Medals, a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star  as a helicopter door gunner, attended college for a few years after leaving  Vietnam and then worked as a roofer.  </P> <P> But one afternoon, as a neighbor was burning trash in a 50-gallon drum in his  back yard, Leed grabbed his uniform from his closet and tossed it in the fire.  </P> <P> "I guess it was some vain attempt to bury something I felt I could never  explain to anybody," Leed said. "I wanted to forget the whole insane experience  in Vietnam and pretend I was normal."  </P> <P> For seven years, Leed said, he succeeded. But after the night of the  bicentennial, Leed, who was living in Michigan at the time, realized "I  couldn't bury it anymore." The images of friends being killed or maimed and the  atrocities he had seen began to plague him. His nightmares became more frequent  and more grotesque. He began waking every night in terror, screaming, punching  the walls.  </P> <P> Leed became afraid to sleep, so he took amphetamines to stay awake. Eventually  he began injecting methamphetamines and developed a serious drug habit. Leed  could not hold a job and lost his apartment. He began sleeping in his car or  spending all night nursing coffee at Denny's.  </P> <P> "I didn't know what was wrong with me," Leed said. "I didn't want to live, but  I was too scared to die."  </P> <P> He checked into a Veterans Administration hospital, where doctors eventually  diagnosed him as being 50% disabled as a result of post traumatic stress  disorder and awarded him a $426-a-month pension.  </P> <P> Many Vietnam veterans are critical of the VA for refusing for years to  acknowledge the high incidence of psychological problems among Vietnam  veterans. It was not until 1980 -- seven years after major American involvement  in the Vietnam War had ended -- that the Veterans Administration and the  American Psychiatric Assn. approved criteria for diagnosing post traumatic  stress disorder.  </P> <P> "The Army discharged my ass 20 years ago and that was that," Leed said. "They  didn't recognize my problems, and, for a long time, neither did I. So I wasted  years of my life. It's pathetic." He shakes his head and briefly closes his  eyes. "I'm 40 years old and I'm just learning how to take care of myself."  </P> <P> But those who run the veterans hotel hope that many of the residents will be  self-sufficient within a year, move into their own apartments and turn their  rooms over to other veterans.  </P> <P> The hotel can accommodate about 50 people, and the monthly cost of a double  room is $260 a month. Funds are available for veterans while they are looking  for work or awaiting social service benefits.  </P> <P> Because the hotel receives state funding, it is prohibited from turning away  non-veterans, but the majority of the beds are designated for Vietnam veterans.  The hotel is expected to be full within a month; currently there are 30  residents, 25 of them veterans.  </P> <P> The huge number of Vietnam veterans among the homeless is helping change the  perception of homeless people as simply bums and winos. Of about 2 million  people who are homeless at some time during the year, up to 700,000 have served  in the armed forces. About 40% of these veterans served during the Vietnam era,  VA surveys show.  </P> <P> When servicemen returned from Vietnam they faced scaled-back GI educational  benefits and a stagnant economy. Because many veterans were poorer and less  educated than those who avoided the war through student deferments, they were  more vulnerable during the 1980s when many industrial jobs were eliminated and  federal funding was sharply cut for low-cost housing. And those veterans with  drug and alcohol problems and psychological disorders had an even harder time  staying off the streets.  </P> <P> Veterans' advocates argue than many of these men made great sacrifices for  their country and deserve some compassion and assistance in return. But many  homeless veterans do not qualify for the narrow pensions and health programs  offered by the VA. A Los Angeles study several years ago found that only 2% of  the homeless veterans were receiving veteran's benefits, although many could  qualify if they applied.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fighting Bureaucracy  </P> <P> "The VA seemed inaccessible to a lot of veterans when they returned from  Vietnam," said Crane of the Homeless Veterans Project. "There was so much  bureaucracy and red tape, and the people who worked there acted so patronizing.  A lot of the troubled vets couldn't get the help they needed."  </P> <P> In response to these complaints, VA officials say, the agency has established  outreach centers, known as Vet Centers, throughout the country for Vietnam  veterans. The Vet Centers offer counseling, group therapy and job referrals,  said Denver Mills, head of the local Vet Center. The Santa Barbara center,  Mills said, now works closely with the veterans' hotel.  </P> <P> "In the past it was very difficult for us to offer homeless vets any real  counseling," Mills said. "If a guy comes in with no food and no job and no  place to sleep, we're not going to say to him: 'Tell me about Vietnam.' But now  that we have a safe place to send them we can begin talking about the traumatic  experiences that led them to the streets. . . . We can begin talking about  Vietnam."  </P></p>

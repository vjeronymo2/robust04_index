			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE GENERAL excitement in the equity market that was kindled by developments in the property sector underpinned trading in the derivatives, though volumes remained thin, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, trading in the June contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 2,869 with sentiment boosted by the strong overnight performance on Wall Street. But selling shortly after the opening brought about a temporary retreat in June and it fell to the day's low of 2,863. However, the positive mood generated by the developments in the property sector and continued speculation of a cut in interest rates in both the UK and German combined to bring about a recovery in the fortunes of the June contract. A firm gilts sector also assisted trading during the afternoon and June reached the day's high of 2,879 just after 3pm. Following a bout of profit-taking in the dying minutes of the session, June finished at 2,865, in line with the underlying cash market. Volume remained poor reaching 6,270 at the official close. The turnover in the traded options remained low in spite of showing a significant improvement. Total volume was 22,974 lots against 14,683 on Tuesday. Just over 5,400 contracts were dealt in the FT-SE 100 and Thames Water, which reported figures yesterday, was the busiest stock option with a day's total of 3,460 contracts.</p>

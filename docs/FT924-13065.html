			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Yeltsin sets up council of republican leaders RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin yesterday proposed that the meeting of the full Russian parliament - the Congress of Peoples Deputies - be postponed from its scheduled date in December to next spring. At the same time, he has created a new level of power, whose authority is unclear - a Council of Republican Leaders, bringing together the presidents of the autonomous republics and regions within Russia. The leaders, meeting in Moscow on Thursday, called for unity among the Russian peoples, and for decentralisation of powers to the republics. The president warned of attempts to create 'parallel structures of power', not just at regional level but also in the centre. He cited the so-called National Salvation Front, made up of patriotic and nationalistic organisations, as a particular threat. The proposal to delay the Congress, backed by republican leaders, is an effort to avoid the crisis which would result from the likely vote of no confidence in the government from the Congress deputies, most of whom are against the economic reforms. Mr Yeltsin said yesterday: 'We will be able to strengthen the state, provide stability, ensure a transformation, only if we have a solid guarantee of the stability of the institutions of power.' Speaking at a session of the Constitutional Commission, which he heads, the Russian president said the constitution must be carefully revised in order to be acceptable to all republics in Russia.</p>

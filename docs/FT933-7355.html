			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Motoring: A reminder of lost youth TOYOTA'S new Supra is a Lexus among super-sports cars. A Lexus? Let me explain. The Lexus LS400 is Toyota's prestige luxury saloon; a 4-litre, V8-engined, top management car that by common consent is quieter than a Rolls-Royce. The Pounds 37,500 two-plus-two Supra has much of the urbanity of a Lexus as well as being ultra rapid. Its twin turbocharged, 3-litre, straight-six engine puts out 326 horsepower at 5,600 rpm and 90 per cent of that at only 1,300 rpm. When I drove it in Germany last week it was still accelerating hard when the speed limiter cut in at 155 mph (250 kph). Without a limiter, Toyota says, it would be good for a shade over 180 mph (290 kph). Far more importantly, it cruised gently on country roads at one-third of that speed. Pick-up was swift without changing out of top. But the effect of dropping down to third and flooring the accelerator was like firing a gun. Buyers are offered a six-speed gearbox, jointly developed by Getrag of Germany and Toyota, or a four-speed automatic for the same price. Good though the manual Supra is to drive, the two-pedal version is much better. With an avalanche of power on tap from 2,000 to 5,000 rpm, who needs six gears anyway? The smooth automatic lets you concentrate on enjoying the Supra's peerless handling in the country and makes for greater relaxation in town traffic. Though it has far more power than any six-cylinder rival it is undemanding to drive. A traction control system eliminates wheel spin when accelerating and maintains the Supra's courtly manners on wet and slippery curves. The Supra rides with much the same comfort as a sporty saloon because the suspension is soft although heavily damped. Only very low speed driving in former East Germany's down-at-heel villages made it feel harsh. The short sidewalls of tyres less than half as high as they are wide cannot absorb the shock of rolling over cobblestones that have not been relaid since the days of horses and carts. Closest rivals of the Supra are the Nissan 300ZX (Pounds 33,230 in Britain) and Mitsubishi 3000GT (Pounds 38,329). It is far cheaper than a Pounds 58,000 Mercedes 300-24v SL, which is the best seller in the sporting high-performance class, less than half the price of the magnificent 3-litre, V8-engined 500 SL I am driving at present. But I do not see them as competitors. Cars of this class are bought as an indulgence, or perhaps to recapture lost youth. (A typical buyer is at least 45 years old and may drive his Supra, SL or Jaguar XJ-S sedately, which is perhaps just as well). They are cars for making a personal statement about their owners rather than for tearing around in. Supra and SL convey different messages. Settling behind the Supra's wheel is a pleasure in itself; the instrument and control layout is faultless. Everything one needs is standard equipment - twin airbags, air conditioning, a front spoiler that drops down at 56 mph (90 kph) and retracts below that speed, leather trim, cruise control, power-adjusted driver's seat and an elaborate anti-theft system. There is only one optional extra; a one-day course on and around Silverstone Circuit with the John Watson Performance Driving School. It will cost Supra buyers Pounds 260. They may feel it is worth every penny because it will be the only chance they will ever have of discovering what their new toy will do.</p>

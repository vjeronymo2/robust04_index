			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Mr Balladur in retreat The doggedness with which the French have stuck to an exceptionally rigorous monetary policy through the present recession commands a certain respect. So, too, does the surprisingly docile response of most of the French people in the face of economic stagnation and rising unemployment. Yet the oddly persuasive combination of patrician calm, monetary rigour and tactical retreat in the face of special interests with which Mr Balladur has confronted his public is finally losing its appeal. This week the French prime minister's approval rating in the polls fell below 50 per cent for the first time. As the OECD's latest survey on France points out, the policy of competitive disinflation could readily be justified until about mid-1992. Since then it has looked increasingly questionable. The defence of the franc within the exchange rate mechanism and the extreme caution that has prevailed since the widening of the ERM bands last year have resulted in high real rates of interest that are not justified by domestic economic conditions. Last year output is estimated to have fallen by  3/4 per cent, unemployment rose to 12 per cent and exports, which were an engine of growth until mid-1992, have fallen. The OECD estimates that the low point of the cycle was reached in the second quarter of 1993, but expects domestic demand to remain weak this year while unemployment continues to grow to a peak of 12 1/2 per cent. The problem is that the French, having entrusted monetary policy to the Bundesbank, are now hostage to external fortune. Given the weakness of demand, a flagging money supply and an underlying inflation rate of 2 per cent or less, a further easing of monetary policy is clearly needed. Yet the Bundesbank is caught on the hook of its own money supply numbers, which continue to run way above target. Further rate reductions may prove to be painfully slow. This seems a high price to pay in pursuit of the uncertain goal of monetary union. The more Mr Balladur's government continues to wait for something to turn up in the macroeconomy, the more it undermines its attempts to address the problems of the supply side. There is a significant structural component in a general government deficit that has been running at 5.8 per cent of GDP; and while measures have been taken to reduce the cost of the state pension system, more still needs to be done to cope with the impact of an ageing population on both pensions and healthcare. That is difficult against a background of recession. Much the same can be said of labour market reform and industrial restructuring. Air France is now to receive another substantial capital injection after its rationalisation plans have been softened to placate the workforce and public opinion. The tough parts of the privatisation programme  -notably Renault where the unions remain militant - will almost certainly be deferred until after the presidential election in 1995. All this is worrying, given the French economy's poor performance in generating new jobs. The risk must be that, if the rest of the European economy does recover, France will merely enjoy jobless growth. If it fails to recover fast, the OECD's alternative prescription of a change in policy mix to launch a renewed assault on the budget deficit looks a political non-option. The French authorities are, then, taking a monumental gamble at the macro-, microeconomic and political levels. The risks inherent in the alternative gamble of seeking to reduce short-term interest rates to below German levels may be less great than perceived. But the political investment in current policy is huge. It will take a a commensurately large shock to change it.</p>

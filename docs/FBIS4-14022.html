			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hamdi Rizq] </F>   [Text] AL-MUSAWWAR has learned that the Prisons Department  last week moved 50 extremists led by Hasan al-Hillawi, who  declared their breakaway from the al-Jihad Organization, from  the al-Istiqbal Prison to the Mazra'at Turrah Jail after  repeated clashes with the old al-Jihad members led by 'Abbud  al-Zumur and Ayman al-Zawahiri inside the al-Istiqbal Prison and  because the security agencies fear killings inside the prison in  light of threats between the two groups. This measure was taken  after the extremists in Ward A and Ward B in al-Istiqbal  rejected the entry into their wards of members belonging to  Hasan al-Hillawi.    A joint statement released inside the prison by the  leaderships of the al-Jihad Organization and the Islamic Group  accused al-Hillawi of supporting the security agencies,  deviating from the consensus, and of being traitors and spies.  They sanctioned their murder. They took this measure to  prevent other members from joining al-Hillawi, who declared his  rejection of acts of violence prevailing among the extremist  groups.    Al-Hillawi used the hospital in the al-Istiqbal Prison as a  shelter for himself and his 50-member group and sought a  dialogue with the leaders of the Islamic Group, particularly  Najih Ibrahim. The latter, however, rejected al-Hillawi and  accused him of being a traitor and spy. Heated arguments took  place between al-Hillawi and members of the al-Jihad  Organization and they were about to engage in fistfights and  hand-to-hand fighting. But policemen intervened, disengaged  the two groups, and decided to move the al-Hillawi followers to  the Mazra'at Turrah Prison.    The recent crisis, the second disturbance in the al-Jihad  Organization after the Muhammad al-Makkawi dissension from  al-Zawahiri, who is living abroad, began when a fax reached Arab  and foreign newspapers signed by Hasan al-Hillawi. Al-Hillawi  is a prominent figure in the al-Jihad Organization and  participated in military sedition in 1977. The fax urged the  extremist groups to exercise self-restraint, stop acts of  violence, lay down their arms, and hold a dialogue with the  government to ease restrictions on detainees. He expressed  readiness to hold this dialogue and declared that it is  inadmissible to oppose the ruler and form groups opposed to the  regime. Although the fax caused confusion among al-Jihad  Organization ranks abroad and raised questions about  al-Hillawi's role in the al-Istiqbal Prison, a lawyer on the  detainees' defense panel asked to meet al-Hillawi on  instructions from abroad to discuss his call and make sure that  he appeared, particularly as he is considered to be an important  intellectual leader in the al-Jihad Organization. The lawyer  met al-Hillawi and asked him what he wanted. Al-Hillawi  answered: I urge the groups to give up acts of violence and I  will undertake a dialogue with the government. At the meeting,  which was also attended by Ahmad Rashid Muhammad Rashid, one of  the most important figures in the Vanguards of Conquest, the  lawyer accused al-Hillawi of trying to get out of jail by any  means, that he was weakening, and that he no longer put up any  resistance. The lawyer advised the group members abroad on the  details of the meeting. Despite the threats that the al-Jihad  members inside the prison made to al-Hillawi to return to the  fold, he rejected them and gained the support of 50 extremists.  He thus established an independent organization and began  making calls denouncing violence and calling for dialogue. The  groups inside the prison considered these calls to be a  deviation from the course by a leading intellectual figure who  played a major role in the military sedition and the  reorganization of the al-Jihad Organization (Case No. 401 of  1977). They feared that his influence might spread to the rest  of the groups and create problems with other members. Bloody  clashes would have occurred had the prison administration not  intervened, saving al-Hillawi and his group from certain death  by moving them to the Mazra'at Turrah Prison.    Disputes continue, involving the leaderships of the  extremists abroad and Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Jihad leader abroad,  and Muhammad al-Makkawi, who is accused in State Security Case  No. 401, known as the reorganization of the al-Jihad  Organization. Attempts by members of the group in Egypt,  particularly lawyers, failed to resolve the dispute despite  reports that al-Zawahiri traveled to Europe and that al-Makkawi  left Pakistan and joined tribes on the border fearing manhunts  by the Pakistani authorities of Arabs there.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Athens urged to attack inflation GREECE'S central bank yesterday urged the government to keep up its fight against inflation, despite political pressures to relax austerity ahead of next spring's election. Mr Efthymios Christodoulou, central bank governor, said before presenting the bank's annual report that year-on-year inflation, still almost four times the European Community average, would 'show a swift decline' later this year. He said a drop in inflation, together with a fall in interest rates and increased public investment, would set the stage for economic recovery, 'but anti-inflationary policies must be strictly upheld even in an election year'. Inflation rose from 14.4 per cent at the end of last year to 16.4 per cent in March. The central bank said price rises for utilities and fuel, together with a jump in food prices as a result of bad weather, caused the increase. The economy ministry hopes to bring inflation down to single digits by the end of the year. However, the government's election campaign organisers are already demanding an additional wage increase for civil servants, limited by the budget to 4 per cent in 1993, and the lifting of restrictions on public sector hiring. The central bank's exchange rate policy also aims at trimming inflation, by slowing down the drachma's decline against the Ecu. In the first quarter of this year, the Greek currency fell by 1.4 per cent against the Ecu, compared to an overall 8.3 per cent drop during 1992.</p>

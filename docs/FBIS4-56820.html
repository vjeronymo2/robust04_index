			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Tomas Borge, member of the FSLN National </F> Directorate, by Noel Irias on 29 April; place not given]    [Text] [Irias] What are the political tasks facing the  Sandinist National Liberation Front [FSLN]?    [Borge] We could say that we are placing all our hopes on  the  FSLN coming out of the congress united, unified, and ready to  prepare a strategic plan for the new situation that will emerge  with the Congress.    The Sandinist Congress represents the culmination of one  phase and the beginning of another during which we must persuade  the Nicaraguan people that we are the best choice for governing  the country and finding solutions to the many problems and  demands that have proliferated in recent times.    [Irias] Is there a threat of division in the FSLN?    [Borge] In all the departments, the rank and file is  demanding unity. Any attempt to break this unity will clash  with the iron will of the Sandinists.    The struggle must be directed against divisionist maneuvers,  if they ever appear, and against attempts to deform the FSLN and  create a different party. The struggle must be directed at  preventing an FSLN sector from installing a different tent and  waging a struggle against the Sandinist Front.    The majority of the Sandinists favor unity. This explains  why an overwhelming majority does not favor endorsing tendencies.    Tendencies can produce division. However, I favor free  debate within the FSLN. Nevertheless, I think that debate must  take place within the party's confines.    We must try to avoid division. Some months ago several  companeros who belong to a specific tendency asked me to run for  secretary general of the FSLN.    I told them: "I do not belong to your tendency. Why are you  inviting me to be your candidate when you have your own cadres?"  They insisted on their offer for some time.    I saw that as a cheap political maneuver aimed at dividing  the historic cadres of the FSLN, specifically speaking: to  produce a confrontation between me and the secretary general of  the Sandinist Front.    I did not fall for that. It was wrong, incorrect, and  opportunistic. Had I run for secretary general, I would not  have been the candidate for unity, as I could have been  ticketed, but the candidate for division.    [Irias] Are you saying that if Henry Ruiz were to run as  candidate for secretary general of the FSLN he would be creating  conditions that would lead to division in the FSLN?    [Borge] What I say about myself perhaps could be said about  another person, but as everybody knows, I prefer not to mention  names. I am mentioning mine so that my case can serve as an  example of what may happen to other companeros.    [Irias] What kind of leadership does the FSLN need?    [Borge] I have always favored collective leadership. Some  reason that the collective leadership was weakened by the  current historic situation. In wartime, power and leadership  must be centralized.    In my opinion, the collective leadership should cover a  broad  spectrum.    The limitations placed on the National Directorate as leader  of the party resulted from a collective decision. The  Directorate decided to centralize authority in the government,  in particular, and those who are now criticizing this decision  are the ones who endorsed it then.    The Directorate handed its authority over to the government,  to the executive, and no one protested at that time.    In existing circumstances we need as secretary general of  the  FSLN -- without detriment to the collective leadership -- a  companero with historical authority, one who has already  demonstrated unselfishness, the ability to go evereywhere, and  the firm decision to lead.    The FSLN rank and file has already chosen this cadre.    On the other hand, everybody has the right to aspire to a  position in the Directorate for the sake of collective  leadership and shared authority, without detriment to the  establishment of hierarchies. I favor the FSLN having a  president and a secretary general.    The presidency, a position to which I aspire, should be  considered a representative of the FSLN, a companero and close  adviser to the secretary general, and his substitute.    Why do I seek this position? It is not because of any  craving for personal ambition or fame, which I do not need, but  because I believe that in this way I would be better able to  contribute to a revolutionary leadership, in addition to  historical reasons.    [Irias] Aren't you afraid that your statements on eventual  candidates for the post of secretary general could increase the  contradictions surrounding this debate?    [Borge] I hope there is no internal division over this  problem. This is why I reported that an effort was made to lure  me in the same way that others have been courted in the search  for a secretary general.    I am mentioning this example to invite militants and leaders  not to do anything that would contravene the FSLN's internal  unity.    [Irias] Would you support Commander Daniel Ortega as  candidate for the post of secretary general?    [Borge] I have said that I prefer not to mention names, but  I  will in this case say that I believe that in the framework of a  collective leadership, Daniel Ortega is the most suitable person  for the post of secretary general.    I have been very critical of Daniel Ortega, much more than  others in the National Directorate and in private.    This critical posture has yielded fruits in recent times. I  have found Daniel receptive to criticism. I never sweet-talk  him, as some people who now criticize him and challenge him did  in the past.    I will never stop being a critic, an adviser, and a  nonservile supporter. I will always tell Daniel Ortega the  truth as I see it.    Of the current cadres, he is the companero most inclined to  criticize. In addition, with the undue will to accommodate him  that we demonstrated in the past, we gave him the intransigent  and authoritarian image he now has.    I think this is over. Vertical leadership is not possible  now. I think that because of his experience, backing, and open  ears, the person most suited to be FSLN secretary general is  Daniel Ortega.</p>

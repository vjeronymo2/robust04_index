			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EARNINGS;  </P> <P> LOWER PRICES CUT SHELL PROFITS  </P> <P> Lower oil prices in the first half of 1990 bit sharply into Royal Dutch/Shell  Group's profits, slicing net income by 40%, the Anglo-Dutch oil giant reported  today.  </P> <P> The sharp rise in crude oil prices after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait a week ago  is not reflected in Shell's latest figures but is expected to influence results  for the full year.  </P> <P> Prices were weak in much of the first six months of the year because OPEC  overproduction glutted the market.  </P> <P> Net income for the first six months of 1990 fell to $2.59 billion from $4.29  billion in the same 1989 period.  </P> <P> "The outlook for the full year is obviously extremely uncertain and almost  entirely dependent on how events in the Middle East unfold," Shell said.  </P></p>

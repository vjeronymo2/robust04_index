			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Javier Gabarrete] </F>   [Text] Chiriqui Grande (Bocas del Toro) -- Early yesterday,  officials of the Bocas del Toro Province Circuit Court, National  Police units, and agents of the Police Investigation and  Information Department (DIIP) seized about 3,000 pounds of pure  cocaine.    The drugs were found at a residence under construction in  Patillo, Chiquiri Grande District.    The drug seizure was made after officials of the Public  Prosecutor's Office in Cocle Province alerted Bocas del Toro  Province authorities on the possible existence of a drug depot  in that district.    Agents of the Judicial Technical Police (PTJ), during field  testing conducted at Bocas del Toro, confirmed that 63 boxes  containing pure cocaine were found during the seizure carried  out by the Bocas del Toro Circuit Court and the Drug Secretariat.    A police report revealed that the raided residence belongs  to  Juan Bautista Gomez, who was arrested on 24 June in Cocle  Province, while transporting 136 boxes containing 2,156 kg of  pure cocaine valued at about $50 million on the international  market.    The drug seized in Bocas del Toro was packaged in small  brown  wrappers for distribution on the black market.    The authorities also arrested two Panamanians who were  guarding the drug. Seven others were arrested later.</p>

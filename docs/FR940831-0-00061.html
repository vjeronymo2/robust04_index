The NPR proposed conditional approval of an enhanced I/M program based upon certain contingencies. The formal SIP revision was submitted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on November 5, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Specific requirements of the Pennsylvania enhanced I/M program and the rationale for EPA's proposed actions are explained in the NPR and will not be restated here. No adverse public comments were received on the NPR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Final Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is conditionally approving the enhanced I/M program as a revision to the Pennsylvania SIP based on certain contingencies. The conditions for approvability are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) By December 31, 1994 a notice must be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pennsylvania Bulletin  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> by the Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PADOT) which certifies that the enhanced I/M program is required in order to comply with federal law, certifies the geographic areas which are subject to the enhanced I/M program (the geographic coverage must be identical to that listed in Appendix A&hyph;1 of the November 5, 1993 SIP submittal), and certifies the commencement date of the enhanced I/M program. This notice must be submitted to EPA as an amendment to the SIP by December 31, 1994;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) By December 31, 1994 the Commonwealth must submit to EPA as a SIP amendment, the amendments to the Pennsylvania I/M regulation, 67 Pa Code &sect;178.202&hyph;205, which require EPA approval prior to implementation of any alternate purge test procedure and incorporate the transient emission standards for Tier 1 vehicles, the Phase 2 standards for all vehicle types and model years, and the transient and evaporative purge test procedures found in the final version of the EPA document entitled ``High-Tech I/M Test Procedures, Emission Standards, Quality Control Requirements, and Equipment Specifications'', EPA&hyph;AA&hyph;EPSD&hyph;IM&hyph;93&hyph;1, April 1994,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Within one year from September 30, 1994, the Commonwealth must submit the PADOT procedures manual for motorist compliance enforcement program oversight as an amendment to the SIP and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Within one year from September 30, 1994, the Commonwealth must submit the PADOT procedures manual for quality assurance as an amendment to the SIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The contingencies for approvability are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) If penalties are assessed against the contractor under the Contractor Responsibility Program in lieu of the penalties in 67 Pa Code &sect;178.602(b) of the Pennsylvania I/M regulation, the penalties must be equal to or more stringent than those in the Commonwealth's I/M regulation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The present contractor or any future contractors for the Pennsylvania I/M program may not have any business interest in a vehicle repair facility anywhere in the continental United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action makes final the action proposed at 59 FR 33709. As noted elsewhere in this notice, EPA received no adverse public comment on the proposed action. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator has reclassified this action from a Table 1 to a Table 3 under the processing procedures established at 54 FR 2214, January 19, 1989.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action has been classified as a Table 3 action for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by October 31, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule for the Pennsylvania enhanced I/M SIP revision does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Wuhan, June 22 (XINHUA) -- Central China's Hubei  Province has launched a "giant program" to restore its prestige  as an industrial base of the country and raise its overall  economic strength.    Some 79 big industrial groups selected from 11 sectors,  including the machine building, metallurgical, chemicals,  textiles, power and petrochemical industries, will be the main  participants in the program.    These groups are now the mainstay of the provincial economy,  including the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, the Dongfeng Motor  Vehicle Company, the Jinmen Petrochemicals Plant and the  Hanchuang Power Plant.    The provincial government will adopt preferential policies  for these enterprises in technical upgrading and implementing  reform measures in a bid to increase their market share.    It plans to increase their sales by an average of 1 billion  yuan (about 120 million U.S. dollars) each year.    The province's fixed industrial assets have come to more  than  80 billion yuan (about 10 billion U.S. dollars).    A committee made up of members of the provincial economic,  planning, finance, banking, taxation and science departments has  been set up to coordinate the implementation of the program.</p>

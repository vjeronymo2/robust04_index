			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (43): New ways to reduce errors - Claire Gooding examines the problem of questionable data lists Sources of Information A COMMON complaint among all the companies interviewed on the subject of database marketing was that there was too much data, rather than not enough. Worse, the quality of the data bought in from list brokers is often questionable. Dick Booth, managing director of Coggon Computer South is used to giving advice to the companies who buy in data to run with his Salesnet system. 'We have done checks on imported data, using telesales techniques, and I would say that about 30 per cent of the target data proves to be inaccurate,' he says. Before asking whose fault this might be, it is worth reflecting on the ways that list brokers and market researchers come by their data. Sometimes - as with NOP - they simply ask, and people are only too happy to tell. But often, data derives from forms which people fill in for other purposes, such as applying for a mortgage, a controlled circulation magazine, or entering a trade exhibition. All too often, the varieties of spelling, abbreviation, and titles, in the name alone, result in multiple records and duplicates. The stories here are about companies whose main product is data - either the collection of it, or the refinement and delivery of it, using computer techniques. It is now possible to buy data on CD-ROM, but a lot of work has to be done on analys is and presentation. Ironically, the area which most needs addressing is that of data capture, still limited by the vagaries of handwriting, and the inevitable errors in transcribing or punching information. Here, computer aided interviewing, CATI, may eliminate the most error-prone part of the loop. One market research company, Ronin, has developed an even more sophis ticated tool, ESBIS, the Expert Based System Interviewing Software, which was recently used in an international survey of IT managers. The system follows the logic by expanding on certain areas with more detailed questions if the respondent showed interest. Most people have become wary of filling in detailed forms: they realise now they might be inviting unwanted mail offers. But even if you try to remain anonymous, or, like Ronin's IT managers, feel 'over-surveyed,' then the profiling systems will still find you. You can't hide from the postman, but you don't have to open the mail.</p>

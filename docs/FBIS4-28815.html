			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in  Japanese in its "Sunday Discussion" (Nichiyo Toron) program at  0000 GMT on 12 June begins broadcasting a live, 60-minute  roundtable discussion on the current political situation in  Japan. The program is moderated by NHK commentator Takashi  Yamamoto. Participating in the discussions are Kozo Watanabe,  acting Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) secretary general, and  Kansei Nakano, secretary general of the Democratic Socialist  Party (DSP), who are at the NHK studio. They are joined by  Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social Democratic Party of  Japan (SDPJ), and Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP), who are linked to the studio via remote  hookup.    Prior to the discussion, the program briefly describes the  current, unstable political situation with the current Diet  session scheduled to adjourn late in June. At 0230 GMT,  Yamamoto asks Mori whether the LDP still plans to submit a  no-confidence motion against the administration of Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata. Mori says that the plan has not been  changed and stresses that the minority government of Prime  Minister Hata should hand over power to the LDP. He states:  "With the passage of the FY 1994 budget, the Hata administration  has finished serving its purpose."    In response, Watanabe says that sensible members of the LDP  and the SDPJ do not really favor Hata's immediate resignation  and that "should the LDP persist in submitting the no-confidence  motion for no due reason, the SDPJ, as well as the general  public, would oppose it."    When asked what he feels about the LDP asking that power be  turned over because Hata currently leads a minority government,  Nakano replies that even though a minority government is not a  normal situation, "it is not sufficient reason to propose a no-  confidence motion."    Asked how he feels about the same matter, Kubo answers:  "There must be a good reason for a no-confidence motion. It is  also irresponsible to turn out a government without the next  administration that will replace it having a sound plan about  what it intends to do." He emphasizes that the party has no  intention of submitting a no-confidence motion right away.    As for the possibility of the SDPJ's returning to the  coalition, Kubo says that the party does not intend to return to  the coalition right away and that it is only considering that  possibility by holding further policy consultations -- not from  the point where the party left the coalition immediately  following the formation of the Kaishin parliamentary group but  rather back when the coalition parties drew up policy accords on  22 April.    Asked to comment on Kubo's remarks, Watanabe states that it  is necessary for the SDPJ to return to the coalition.    Nakano agrees and says that the DSP will do its part to try  to convince the SDPJ to return to the coalition.    Mori says that although it is up to the SDPJ to decide  whether to return to the coalition, all the parties concerned  should look back at what caused the SDPJ to leave the coalition,  and he states that power should be turned over to the LDP  because both Prime Minister Hata and former Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa have advocated creating a political structure  under which political forces can take turns ruling whenever this  is appropriate.    Watanabe says that the LDP can naturally return to power if  it can win a majority of seats in the next general election that  would be held under a new electoral system. He urges the LDP to  support the Hata administration for the time being because the  economy finally seems to be headed for a recovery and because  there is the current need to deal with the DPRK nuclear issue.  Watanabe adds that the LDP should then take on the coalition in  a general election after these problems have been solved.    Mori notes that the LDP has already offered the coalition  sufficient cooperation.    Asked whether the SDPJ plans to propose a no-confidence  motion if the Hata administration fails to resign voluntarily,  Kubo answers that the party is not out to topple the  administration just for the sake of toppling it but rather that  the party is prepared to offer its full cooperation toward  forming a new coalition government. He adds that a general  election following the dissolution of the Diet is an option.    The discussion then continues on the issue of the SDPJ's  possible return to the coalition.    At 0027 GMT, Kubo explains topics on which agreement needs  to  be reached between the SDPJ and the coalition parties as a  condition for the SDPJ's return to the coalition. Nakano  emphasizes the importance of thorough discussions toward this  end, and Watanabe reiterates this.    Concerning possible policy consultations between the LDP and  the SDPJ, Mori says that under the current conditions, it would  be difficult for the two parties to hold concrete consultations.    At 0039 GMT, Yamamoto asks Kubo about the SDPJ's view  regarding the consumption tax. Kubo replies that the government  should make greater efforts to make the people understand the  need for a consumption tax increase, rather than having the  government just say that this is necessary because of expected  revenue shortfalls. Watanabe explains that the coalition  government is currently working on tax reforms which fully  consider the SDPJ's suggestions.    Asked about the situation within the LDP on the issue of  submitting a no-confidence motion against the Hata  administration, Mori denies that the party is divided over this  issue, saying: "When I spoke to Mr. [Toshiki] Kaifu the other  day, he said that his intentions were not necessarily being  conveyed accurately. Mr. [Hiroshi] Mitsuzuka said that the  party should not submit a no- confidence motion while knowing  that it will be defeated. Of course, it goes without saying  that the party needs to listen to such opinions from both within  and outside the party."    At 0048 GMT, Yamamoto shows an illustration which portrays  the courses of action if a no-confidence motion were to be  submitted and what might happen if the motion were not  submitted. Discussions continue on the issues of a  no-confidence motion, a dissolution of the Diet, and the next  general election.    After lengthy discussions, the program ends at 0100 GMT.</p>

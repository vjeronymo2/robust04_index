			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Fear overcomes greed in the US - The prospects for government bonds after last week's turmoil FEAR, at last, overcame greed in the US bond market last week. After a fortnight of uncertainty about how much longer the bull run could last, the bears emerged triumphant, triggering the biggest sell-off the bond market had seen since prices began their climb a year ago. By the end of the week the fall in prices had driven up the yield on the benchmark 30-year government bond to 6.2 per cent, a level last seen in August during its long journey downwards. The blood-letting also spilled over into the equity markets, where worries over the prospect of rising interest rates prompted a bout of heavy selling. Warning signs of the bond market sell-off had been building up as government figures increasingly pointed towards a strengthening of economic activity. Investors typically regard such data as a threat of rising inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-interest securities. Already unnerved, the market last week gave up its resistance when confronted by yet another barrage of figures pointing towards economic growth. The October index of manufacturing activity turned out to be higher than expected; construction spending was up; new home sales showed the biggest monthly increase in seven years; and strong October car sales confirmed that consumers were in a spending mood. The week ended with publication of data showing that payrolls expanded by 177,000 jobs last month - considerably more than the 150,000 or so that had been expected - and that manufacturing employment had ended a seven-month slide. The result of all this good news was that, by Friday's close, the long bond had shed nearly 3 1/2 points to 100 1/2 over the week - and investors were looking anxiously ahead to key announcements to be made this week on the October figures for inflation and retail sales. Few are predicting any reversal in the bearish trend, at least in the short term. The spate of buoyant economic indicators has come as a sharp reminder that inflation may not stay low for ever. Also, with the year-end looming, portfolio managers are grappling with the inevitable temptation to realise their gains by selling. Meanwhile, the short end of the yield curve is being influenced by a heavy supply of government debt: Smith Barney Shearson, the Wall Street brokerage firm, estimates that Treasury issues of securities with maturities of three years or less will gross nearly Dollars 175bn in November, raising Dollars 39bn in new cash. In addition, the market is concerned that the Federal Reserve Board, mindful of the economic pressures, will make its next interest rate move upwards rather than downwards. Even so, nothing is forever - and in this case, analysts do not believe the bond market bears will predominate for long. Mr Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities' New York office, points out there is a distinct feeling of deja vu about all the good economic news. The US saw much the same pattern last year - a weak first half followed by a strong second half - only for things to start slowing down again as the new year began. Mr Brusca thinks that bond yields will keep on edging upwards to reach 6.5 per cent by the end of the year. But he is not alone in the belief that the bulls will be back. After all, there are still plenty of negative factors threatening to restrain economic growth. The decline in defence spending is not going to go away; the effects of the Clinton administration's tax increases will begin to bite next year; and the cost to employers of the planned reforms in the health care system could suppress employment growth. Many analysts believe it will not be long before yields are back below the 6 per cent mark. The economic fundamentals have not fundamentally altered. 'The big picture for inflation is still very favourable,' says Mr Brusca, 'but there are going to be some bumps along the road.' Last week, it seems, was just one of them.</p>

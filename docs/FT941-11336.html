			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: Paribas confirms upturn with estimated 58% gain Paribas, one of France's leading banking groups, continued its recovery last year with a 58 per cent increase in estimated net profits to FFr1.4bn (Dollars 237.2m) from FFr886m in 1992. Mr Andre Levy-Lang, chairman, said the group had benefited from a very good performance in market trading, where it made strong gains during this summer's European currency crisis. It fared well in its North American and Asian banking activities. He forecast another profit increase this year saying that Paribas, which has been recovering from its poor performance in 1991 when it made its first loss, 'should be able to continue the improvement in its results during 1994'. However, the group's shares yesterday fell by FFr8 to FFr581 following Wednesday's rise of FFr26 to FFr589 on speculation that Paribas was about to announce the sale of part of its stake in Navigation Mixte, the industrial group with which it has a cross-shareholding agreement. Mr Levy-Lang yesterday sought to squash the rumours by stating that Paribas had no plans to reduce its stake in Navigation Mixte. He said it had raised FFr1.5bn by selling 12 per cent of Poliet, the building materials concern, and FFr1bn from the sale of 5 per cent of Ciments Francais, the cement company. Paribas estimated that its total operating income rose to FFr33.3bn in 1993 from FFr29bn with gross operating income rising to FFr13.5bn from FFr11.3bn. However, it was forced to make FFr9.2bn of new net provisions against FFr7.7bn in 1992 partly due to the problems of the French property market. Mr Levy-Lang said that commercial property was still depressed, but the situation was improving in residential property. Paribas is the first of the big French banks to publish estimated results for 1993. The announcement coincided with a one-day strike by banking workers in protest against lack of consultation on job losses and government plans for longer opening hours. Meanwhile, the government is in the throes of negotiating a complex recapitalisation package worth between FFr3bn and FFr4bn for Credit Lyonnais, another big bank, in preparation for its privatisation.</p>

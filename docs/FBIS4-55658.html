			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Olga Prekopova: "Still Marxist-Leninist"] </F>   [Excerpts] Levice--The welcoming of delegations of  communist and workers parties from the Czech Republic, China,  the DPRK, Vietnam, Poland, Hungary, Austria, Russia, Ukraine,  and Cuba marked the opening of the First Congress of the  Communist Party of Slovakia [KSS] in Levice on 14 May. The KSS  was established in 1992 through the merger of the KSS '91 and  the Union of Communists of Slovakia.    KSS Chairman Vladimir Dado stressed that the party's  membership base has considerably increased of late, with many  young people joining the party. According to Dado, 6,123  members are working in the party's more than 200 primary  organizations. The congress approved the preservation of the  party's orientation toward Marxist-Leninist principles and  subscribed to the program of the Lubochna congress [of  Marxist-Leninist Social Democrats from Slovakia] of 73 years  ago. The KSS regards itself as a party of workers, farmers, and  the intelligentsia and relies, in particular, on "the workers'  class and the youth." It assesses the post-1989 development as  a path of class-motivated revenge and the restoration of  capitalism by force. Vladimir Dado regretted the unwillingness  of the Party of the Democratic Left, the Social Democrats, and  the Association of Workers of Slovakia to set up a left-wing  bloc with the KSS. "If we do not succeed in forming a bloc, we  will go into the elections independently," he said. During the  debate, the media came repeatedly under heavy fire because they  supposedly refuse to provide scope to the party. [passage  omitted] The delegates to the two-day congress approved the  party's program and statutes and reelected Vladimir Dado as KSS  chairman.    [Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 16 May on page 2  carries a 300-word TA SR report on the First KSS Congress. The  report notes that the newly approved party statutes include "one  major change in that the Executive Committee has been replaced  by a 15-member Presidium" as the party's steering body. The  report also mentions that "Ladislav Jaco was elected KSS central  secretary."]</p>

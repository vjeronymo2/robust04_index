In his interview with Interfax Mamedov expressed  opinion that the tripartite Russian-American-Ukrainian agreement  on nuclear weapons withdrawal from the Ukrainian territory is  one of the major results of the U.S. President Bill Clinton's  visit to Moscow. "We have all grounds to be satisfied," he said.    Mamedov specially stressed that Russian President Boris  Yeltsin was initiator of the proposal to hold a tripartite  meeting in Moscow.    According to Mamedov, "the uranium contract" which has also  become one of the major results of the Moscow summit would not  have been signed if we had failed to agree with Kiev.    When asked about the scale of compensation which Russia  would  pay to Ukraine for the nuclear weapons to be withdrawn from its  territory, Mamedov answered that "on the whole this problem has  been coordinated." "The agreement signed in Massandra (Crimea)  fixes the volume of the compensation, cost, sums, etc. The  Americans have repeatedly declared about their support to the  Massandra agreements. One can view the Moscow agreement as their  further development," he said.    As Mamedov said, a compromise formula was agreed "primarily  not at the tripartite Russian-American-Ukrainian talks in  Washington but between the Ukrainian leadership and us."    "The thing is that we are withdrawing nuclear weapons from  Ukraine to Russia, dismantling it, extracting uranium, and  selling fuel uranium to America. A part of these funds with the  exception of expenditures attributed to transportation, storage,  and re- processing of uranium Russia will hand over to Ukraine  as compensation," he continued.    Mamedov does not rule out possibility that at first Russia  would give uranium to Ukraine as fuel for its atomic power  stations. "We shall probably retain part of this fuel for  ourselves. Nobody is going to rob us," he noted.    Mamedov also reported that the Moscow summit had discussed  "very interesting proposals regarding the fact how one can re-  focus international package of assistance to Russia given our  difficult economic situation." "The Americans understand quite  well that Russians should feel that democracy gives something to  them that it is not just a trap into which they have been  pushed," her said.    As an example Interfax interlocutor mentioned the following:  "Russia delivers oil to its neighbors, former Soviet republics.  We increase the prices to the world ones. But it can occur  that our partners will not be able to procure oil in our  country. Then we shall be deprived of markets. They can be  occupied by rich oil producing countries which can offer more  beneficial conditions. What has America done? - The Americans  have persuaded the "G-7" and International Monetary Fund to  grant subsidies to our neighbors so that they would continue to  buy Russian oil. It's an absolutely new form of partnership."</p>

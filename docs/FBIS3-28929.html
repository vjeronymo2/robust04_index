The  official, requesting anonymity, said he "favors exchange rates  that reflect economic fundamentals."    The dollar fell more than 2 yen to sink below 106 yen in  Tokyo after Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President  Bill Clinton failed to reach an agreement on the framework trade  talks at their weekend meeting in Washington.    Rejecting possibilities of an overall review of the trade  talks, the official said both sides decided on "a cooling-off  period" but "the July deadline is unchanged."    Aside from the issue of "objective criteria" which lead to  the failure of the summit, the official said the insurance field  was "near agreement," and stressed that Japan would continue  promoting deregulatory steps and other measures.</p>

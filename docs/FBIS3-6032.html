Inoue, 69, is believed to be one of several Diet members  that  leading contractor Kajima Corp. asked to exercise their  influence to help block an accusation by the Fair Trade  Commission (FTC) against a bid-rigging scheme involving Kajima  in Saitama Prefecture.    By questioning Inoue, prosecutors aim to prove a statement  by  Kajima's former vice president, Shinji Kiyoyama, 67. He claimed  he asked several Diet members, including Inoue and former  Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura, to help his company.    Nakamura, 44, was arrested Friday on suspicion of taking a  10  million yen bribe from Kajima in January 1992.    Nakamura is suspected of taking the money for exerting his  influence as deputy head of an antimonopoly lobby to help block  the possible accusation by the FTC.    The sources said soon after the FTC made on-the-spot  inspections on companies involving in the bid-rigging scheme in  May 1991, Kiyoyama asked Inoue how to evade the accusations.    Afterwards, Inoue met then-FTC Chairman Setsuo Umezawa, 62,  at his Tokyo office and asked whether the antimonopoly watchdog  would file a criminal complaint over the bid-rigging scheme, the  sources said.    Inoue admitted he had met Kiyoyama but declined to comment  on  whether he was asked about ways to evade the FTC's accusations  because investigations are still underway.    The FTC announced in May 1992 that it would not file an  accusation with prosecutors due to a lack of evidence and  instead ordered the contractors to stop the collusive activities.    The present chairman of the FTC, Masami Kogayu, told  reporters Friday that the commission was never influenced by  outside forces on decisions involving cases violating the  antimonopoly law.    Inoue, former vice construction minister, is known for his  close ties with the construction industry. He became director  general of the National Land Agency in December 1993 under then  Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of the LDP.    Kiyoyama, who is now on trial on charges of sending bribes  to  former Ibaraki Governor Fujio Takeuchi, was rearrested Tuesday  for allegedly sending the bribe to Nakamura.    Meanwhile, attorneys who met Nakamura at the Tokyo Detention  House told reporters that he had denied all the allegations  against him when he was questioned by prosecutors.    During a 20-minute meeting on Saturday morning, Nakamura was  quoted by the two attorneys as saying he has no complaints about  the treatment he has received and that he had slept well.</p>

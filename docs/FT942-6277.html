			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Survey of the Computer Industry - Battle for the Desktop (4): Strategic shift by top companies / The move to client-server technology is generally acknowledged as one of the key issues for business in the 1990s More than 40 per cent of top companies anticipate a shift to client-server computing in the next few years, according to a survey conducted by computer industry analysts at International data Corporation. Companies view this change as more important than open systems, outsourcing or facilities management, the survey claims. Client-server technology breaks computer systems down into front-end 'client' workstations and back-end 'server' processes. In most cases, this means client personal computers used to access centralised, corporate server systems across a network. Attention has, so far, focused on the 'client' side of client-server systems. The advantages of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are now widely acknowledged and few companies would consider building new systems without them. The server side, however, tends to be hidden from the user and has received less attention. This is likely to change as the importance of server computers grows over the next few years. Part of the reason for the lack of attention to server systems is that many of them are direct descendants of the previous generation of systems. Many companies have replaced their 'dumb' terminals with PC workstations - but have held on to their old mainframe or mini computers to act as server systems. While this is not necessarily the most efficient technological approach, it is certainly more practical given the large investment that many companies have in their so-called 'legacy' systems. This could change, however. The economies of scale which once lay in large systems have been transferred to chip manufacture and a new breed of special-purpose server computers are beginning to emerge. These servers can use the same mass-market, commodity chip technology which has brought down the cost of PCs. At the same time, traditional mainframe and minicomputer suppliers are moving their underlying technology in the same direction to gain the same advantages. 'Evolution is the key word and the transition that is taking place is more to do with distributed computing than necessarily client-server,' says Mrs Jolanta Pilecka, client-server programmer manager at Hewlett Packard in the UK. 'We have to work out what we expect a server system to do and tie it back to the business need. This means using different types of server to solve different problems,' she adds. 'At one level, you might need a database server for departmental use. At a higher level, you need an enterprise-wide server which has different characteristics.' Mrs Pilecka sees a future both for traditional servers based on proprietary computers at the enterprise level and for 'open' servers at the departmental level. Other established manufacturers agree - 'there are three levels to client-server systems: the desktop client, the departmental server and the enterprise server. We are using a range of technologies to meet the demand,' says Mr Philip Crawford, UK managing director of Bull. 'This includes everything from Intel's Pentium chip to the proprietary enterprise systems. What is important is to reduce the cost of ownership of the server technology for companies and you can do this with all kinds of technology,' he adds. Bull is now working on three fronts to produce server technology. It is using the Intel Pentium chip to build low-level servers. It is devising new multiple processor technology to improve the price/performance of its proprietary systems. And it is working with IBM on a joint development touse the PowerPC risc chip to create a new generation of server systems based on the Unix operating system. 'We are trying to give our customers the option either to stick with improved proprietary systems for their foundation applications or to move to new technologies where it is appropriate,' explains Mr Crawford. IBM is taking a similar approach - but points out that there are significant advantages in proprietary server systems based on traditional mainframes - 'the mainframe has some characteristics which are especially suited to the enterprise environment. Most companies who are looking at real busines applications have taken an evolutionary path,' says Mr Steve Craggs, CICS business manager at IBM UK. 'You start by taking the mainframe application and put a GUI front end on it to deliver productivity to the desktop. You can then start deploying local servers to act as a gateway to the mainframe and off-load some of the processing overhead.' Surprisingly, computer builders with a PC background also agree with this approach: 'What we are saying to our customers is that client-server is not all about technology and cutting costs; it's about putting a better user-interface in front of the user and backing it up with good quality services,' says Mr Steve Wanless, product marketing manager at Sequent UK, the multiple-microprocessor systems builder. 'If you have a well-defined interface between the client and the server, it doesn't matter what the server is. It can just as easily be a legacy mainframe as a new multiple processor system. You run the legacy server while it is economic and then replace it with newer technology.' Manufacturer's with a PC background do, however, have an advantage over established mainframe suppliers: they can design their server technology from scratch without having to worry about existing systems - 'the big manufacturers have many different interests to reconcile - new frontiers to explore and old ones to defend. We can design our server technology without reference to the past,' says Mr James Minotto, marketing director at UK PC builder, Elonex. While he accepts that the mainframe server has a strong place in the enterprise network because of its large capacity and power, Mr Minotto sees a growing market for servers based on PC technology at the local level - 'of course, the PC does not have the range of the mainframe, you have the capability to produce 'state of the art' management information and you can distribute the power to manipulate data with low-cost servers,' he explains. One thing is clear: there will be plenty of choice for companies when they come to select new server technology - whether it comes from the evolution of mainframes or the new special-purpose servers now being developed by PC-based manufacturers.</p>

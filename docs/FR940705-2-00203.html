			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Appendix G&hyph;III&hyph;L. Biological safety cabinets referred to in this section are classified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as Class I, Class II, or Class III cabinets. A Class I is a ventilated cabinet for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel protection having an inward flow of air away from the operator. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exhaust air from this cabinet is filtered through a high efficiency particulate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air/HEPA filter. This cabinet is used in three operational modes: (i) with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full-width open front, (ii) with an installed front closure panel (having four 6-inch  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diameter openings) without gloves, and (iii) with an installed front closure panel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipped with arm-length rubber gloves. The face velocity of the inward flow of air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through the full-width open front is 75 feet per minute or greater. A Class II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cabinet is a ventilated cabinet for personnel and product protection having an open  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> front with inward air flow for personnel protection, and HEPA filtered mass  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recirculated air flow for product protection. The cabinet exhaust air is filtered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through a HEPA filter. The face velocity of the inward flow of air through the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full-width open front is 75 feet per minute or greater. Design and performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifications for Class II cabinets have been adopted by the National Sanitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Foundation, Ann Arbor, Michigan. A Class III cabinet is a closed-front ventilated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cabinet of gas tight construction which provides the highest level of personnel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection of all biosafety safety cabinets. The interior of the cabinet is protected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from contaminants exterior to the cabinet. The cabinet is fitted with arm-length  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rubber gloves and is operated under a negative pressure of at least 0.5 inches water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gauge. All supply air is filtered through HEPA filters. Exhaust air is filtered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through two HEPA filters or one HEPA filter and incinerator before being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharged to the outside environment. National Sanitation Foundation Standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 49. 1976. Class II (Laminar Flow) Biohazard Cabinetry, Ann Arbor, Michigan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix G&hyph;III&hyph;M. Biosafety Level 1 is suitable for work involving agents of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unknown or minimal potential hazard to laboratory personnel and the environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The laboratory is not separated from the general traffic patterns in the building.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Work is generally conducted on open bench tops. Special containment equipment is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not required or generally used. Laboratory personnel have specific training in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures conducted in the laboratory and are supervised by a scientist with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general training in microbiology or a related science (see Appendix G&hyph;III&hyph;B).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix G&hyph;III&hyph;N. Biosafety Level 2 is similar to Level 1 and is suitable for work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involving agents of moderate potential hazard to personnel and the environment. It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differs in that: (1) laboratory personnel have specific training in handling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pathogenic agents and are directed by competent scientists; (2) access to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratory is limited when work is being conducted; and (3) certain procedures in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which infectious aerosols are created are conducted in biological safety cabinets or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other physical containment equipment (see Appendix G&hyph;III&hyph;B).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix G&hyph;III&hyph;O. Office of Research Safety, National Cancer Institute, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Special Committee of Safety and Health Experts, Laboratory Safety Monograph: A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Supplement to the NIH Guidelines for Recombinant DNA Research, NIH, Bethesda,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Maryland 1978.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix G&hyph;III&hyph;P. Biosafety Level 3 is applicable to clinical, diagnostic, teaching,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> research, or production facilities in which work is conducted with indigenous or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exotic agents which may cause serious or potentially lethal disease as a result of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure by the inhalation route. Laboratory personnel have specific training in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handling pathogenic and potentially lethal agents and are supervised by competent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scientists who are experienced in working with these agents. All procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involving the manipulation of infectious material are conducted within biological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety cabinets or other physical containment devices or by personnel wearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate personal protective clothing and devices. The laboratory has special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engineering and design features. It is recognized, however, that many existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities may not have all the facility safeguards recommended for BL3 (e.g., access  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> zone, sealed penetrations, and directional airflow, etc.). In these circumstances,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable safety may be achieved for routine or repetitive operations (e.g.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diagnostic procedures involving the propagation of an agent for identification,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> typing, and susceptibility testing) in laboratories where facility features satisfy BL2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendations provided the recommended ``Standard Microbiological Practices,''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Special Practices,'' and ``Containment Equipment'' for BL3 are rigorously followed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The decision to implement this modification of BL3 recommendations should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made only by the Principal Investigator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

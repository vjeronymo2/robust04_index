			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Louise Marsland] </F>   [Text] The boundaries of towns and suburbs in and around  Johannesburg are to be redrawn in a bid to create new nonracial  municipalities for the region, but recommendations put forward  by the statutory and political bodies involved differ  substantially. A common theme in creating the new towns,  however, is that emphasis has firmly been placed on  socio-economic and demographic considerations. The new  municipal areas have to be economically viable and represent a  fair population mix of both rich and poor, thereby equally  distributing the burden of reconstruction, according to sources  within the Central Witwatersrand Metropolitan Chamber  negotiating forum.    A transitional metropolitan council (TMC) for the central  Witwatersrand area is due to be in place within weeks to oversee  the creation of non-racial town councils in the area and prepare  for local government elections next year. Johannesburg and  Soweto are one of several major urban areas which will have a  metropolitan council to assist in the integration and  co-ordination of urban economies. It will legislate over the  town councils in its metropolitical jurisdiction.    The Metropolitan Chamber negotiating forum is busy drawing  up  the internal and external boundaries of the TMC, which will  legislate for the present areas of Greater Johannesburg and  Soweto.    In the next few weeks there will be intense debate on the  proposals handed in by the city and town councils, and on the  proposals to be handed in next week by the ANC and its alliance  of civic organisations.    There are two major points of departure that have to be  ironed out before a final constitution for the TMC and its  metropolitan substructures (municipalities) is mapped out. One  is the power to be vested in the metropolitan authority,  including who gets to redistribute the revenue generated in the  region, and the other is the size of the new municipalities.    The statutory side have proposed that the present racially  fragmented system of local government in the province be  rationalised by establishing eight local councils on the basis  of redrawn boundaries. The approximate size of each new  municipality would be 400,000 people per local council, although  they would differ in size.    Dr Harry Formanek, who represents several Randburg ratepayer  and resident federations and sits on the Metropolitan Chamber  committee responsible for investigating new boundaries, warns  that the maps being released now are merely scenarios and will  still change significantly. "There are maps floating around all  over the place and everyone has a different idea. These are  proposals based on economic reality and boundary reality," he  says.    The city and town councils also want future local councils  to control their own budgets, subject to the obligation to  deliver the minimum standards of service set out by the  metropolitan government; separate administrative infrastructure  for the metropolitan government and the local councils to  perform the powers and functions allocated to them; and a single  metropolitan-wide property valuation roll.    It is known that the non-statutory bodies on the  Metropolitan  Chamber believe that all revenue generated by the new municipal  areas should be given to the TMC on the basis of one  municipality, one tax base, to redistribute the money where  needed.    The ANC and its alliance partners in the Metropolitan  Chamber  are expected to table the creation of more than 12 new  municipalities under the Witwatersrand metropolitan council,  each with about 200,000 people within their boundaries. They  also want "all powers currently exercised by apartheid local  authorities and bodies to the immediately transferred to the  TMC". The ANC and its partners also believe that attacking  poverty and deprivation will be the first priority of the TMC.    The statutory side also propose that "administrator bodies"  be appointed for the existing local authorities to oversee the  transfer of assets, rights and obligations to the TMC and  relevant local councils, oversee budgets and ensure the  continuation of services while the existing segregated councils  are being dissolved. It has also been proposed that a  reconstruction and development programme be agreed on for  immediate implementation and a strategic management team be  appointed to look after the metropolitan change-management  process.    Once the transitional metropolitan and municipal structures  are in place in the Witwatersrand area -- hopefully before the  end of the year -- the boundaries will be finalised and  preparation for elections will begin. The holding of elections  and the setting up of final structures is expected to take place  in the second half of next year.    The statutory bodies propose that 30 members be nominated by  the Central Witwatersrand Metropolitan Chamber negotiating forum  for each local council in the transitional phase and 60 members  nominated for the TMC, with 10 elected for the TMC executive  committee.    Formanek urges all community organisations to get themselves  involved now by attending the Metropolitan Chamber subcommittees  on boundaries. "We need meaningful input and there is a  distinct lack of community-based organisations on these forums.  We need people to become involved now."</p>

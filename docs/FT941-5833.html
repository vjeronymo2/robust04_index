			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Vital element in pensions regulation Sir, In your interesting history of the regulators' involvement in controlling pensions transfers, one aspect was missed - the practitioner's input. One of the main reasons for any damage that will come to light over the next few months will be the technical inadequacy of the individuals advising the public on this most complex of subjects. These inadequacies were present in the regulators. On my appointment to the Fimbra council in December 1991, I persuaded colleagues of the need to address the pension transfer issue. In early February 1992 I consulted with OPAS, the Society of Pensions Consultants and NAPF, and produced a note on best practice which Fimbra published. Lautro worked alongside us and published its guidance at the same time. Evidence points to an improvement in compliance from that date. The technical competency of regulators is improving dramatically, but they cannot be expected to have the same in-depth knowledge of every aspect of financial services as practitioners. The public could well be damaged again by those who seek to exclude practitioners from participation in regulation at the highest levels and those calling for the easy-ride option of statutory regulation. Hopefully, PIA will ensure that experts, rather than politicians, from the financial services industry have a direct influence on policy. This form of self-regulation should ensure the consumer will not get fooled again.

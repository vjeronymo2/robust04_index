			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Roberto Reyes from Hernan Acosta Mejia Air Force </F> Base in Tegucigalpa -- live]    [Text] [Reyes] General Luis Alonso Discua, chief of the  Honduran Armed Forces, [words indistinct] We are going to try  to interview the top military chief now that he is preparing to  receive a report by Air Force authorities. Good morning,  General, this is HRN [Voz de Honduras Network] [words  indistinct], and we want to ask you about the latest reports  [words indistinct] in the country. We are now trying to  interview Gen. Discua at the Air Force base.    General, we would like to ask you about the action by....  [pauses] It is impossible. Security is not letting us talk to  Gen. Discua. Following Discua's car, we see President Carlos  Roberto Reina's car approaching. We are going to try and wait  for the president to arrive to learn his views. The general did  not want to talk. He flatly refused [words indistinct] to  answer our questions. The president's car is approaching Hernan  Acosta Mejia Air Force Base. Gustavo Torres seems to be helping  us improve the sound quality from the base. We are going to  interview the president, if he is ready to make a statement, if  he wants to talk to the media. The president's white car is  reaching the area where he will get out. We will try to carry  his remarks on HRN, as he is now getting out of his car.    Good morning, Mr. President. HRN is voicing the people's  concern over the reports of a plot against you.    [Reina] I think this is a warning for anyone involved in  public life or governing the state. Deep down, these are  criminal activities by mobsters; that is my impression. Nobody  is immune to those dangers. I have the support of the majority  of the people, to whom I am grateful for their tremendous  demonstration of support in the wake of this development, which  we all must express regret over and condemn. These are no  longer [words indistinct] Mexico has recently become the victim  of this kind of turmoil, which, of course, forces us to be very  careful with these criminals.    [Reyes] We are going to listen to the president.    [Reina] I give it no credence. I am saying this is something  to be condemned, rejected, but real [words indistinct].    [Reyes] Different sectors of society have supported you  [words indistinct], but some have said this may be [words  indistinct].    [Reina] There are always those who have different opinions,  which I respect.    [Unidentified reporter] Why [words indistinct], Mr.  President?    [Reina] These are criminal acts. Any public official....  [pauses] And reporters should be careful too.    [Reporter] Politics have nothing to do with this, Mr.  President?    [Reina] No, no. These are criminal acts.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct].    [Reina] Out of courtesy, and because we are friends [passage  indistinct]. Some calls of support and solidarity [words  indistinct] for the president of all Hondurans.    [Reyes] Have you ruled out politics?    [Reina] Yes, I have.    [Reyes] These were remarks by President Reina from Hernan  Acosta Mejia.</p>

			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Mirror staff may leave NUJ THE NATIONAL Union of Journalists (NUJ) was threatened with a split yesterday after one of its largest office branches voted to leave the union. Members of the 288-strong Daily Mirror chapel decided by 94 votes to 76 not to stay in the NUJ. They will decide their next move on Wednesday. One possibility is that they will join the British Association of Journalists, which is being set up by Mr Steve Turner, a former Daily Mirror journalist, who was dismissed as general secretary last year after clashes with the union's executive. Many Mirror journalists are angry about the way Mr Turner was treated, and some believe a breakaway organisation would attract journalists at other newspapers because of dissatisfaction with what are perceived as the NUJ's leftwing policies. Union breakaways usually struggle to win large memberships in the face of difficulties in gaining affiliation to the Trades Union Congress and resistance to change from members of the organisation. Leaders of the Nupe public-service union yesterday won the backing of their annual conference for plans to merge with the Nalgo and Cohse public-service unions. The merger would create a 1.5m-strong union. Assuming the annual conferences of Nalgo and Cohse also agree to the merger plans later this month, members will be asked to vote on the issue later in the year. The merger would go ahead in July next year.</p>

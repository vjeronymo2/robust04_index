			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE RESISTANCE AT KMEX-TV TO UNIVISION'S 'CUBANIZATION'  </P> <P> As a Chicana, it is inconceivable to me, after all the discrimination we have  suffered, that some Latinos might want to deny a share of the American Dream to  newer Hispanic minorities.  </P> <P> For Mexican-Americans to gripe about the achievements of Cubans, Central  Americans, Puerto Ricans, etc., is an embarrassment.  </P> <P> Hard work, unity and a generosity of spirit are commendable; anything else  makes us no better than those who discriminate against us.  </P> <P> Shame on you, KMEX petition signers.  </P> <P> MERCY MENDEZ  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Observer: Home to roost A fresh challenge to animal trainers has just been thrown down by the Church of England's general synod - how to house-train bats. Protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act, they are also favoured by vicars who mostly like to have them in their rafters, if not belfries. Alas the welcome they've been given is now coming home to roost, with worshippers complaining of the fall-out. The 'unpleasant excretory consequences' are a growing problem, the synod was informed by Canon Michael Saward of St Paul's Cathedral.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Cable's calming message Judging by the 4 per cent rise in its shares, yesterday's annual results from Cable and Wireless were a successful exercise in investor reassurance. But it is too early to conclude that the shares deserve more than a limited re-rating following their 15 per cent underperformance this year. After the abortive AT&amp;T talks and fumbled senior management changes, C and W needs to do more than remind the market that its main businesses have unusual scope for growth. Management must now convert that into profits. The figures were marred by a Pounds 70m exceptional charge which held the pre-tax rise to 6 per cent. Thanks to the collapse of the Jamaican dollar, the charge was Pounds 18m higher than expected. Nevertheless, the 12.3 per cent full-year dividend increase was more than adequate compensation, and the one-third jump in Mercury's trading profit to Pounds 155m was a welcome bonus. With global alliances ruled out as insufficiently profitable, C and W's strategy is to concentrate on basic telecoms and mobile telephony, using the lucrative business market as a bridge. That will require annual investment of Pounds 1bn for the next three years, while gearing will rise to around 40 per cent this year. The weak dollar remains a hindrance; each one-cent movement against sterling affects the bottom line by Pounds 3m. All the same, either Mercury or Hong Kong Telecom should be enough to give C and W a competitive advantage. If the sluggish UK economy fails to push Mercury along, Hong Kong Telecom's link with China should oblige. It is hard to deny the group's long-term attractions.</p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / International Company News: Death of a legendary Wall St partnership - Joseph Perella's departure from the deal-maker he co-founded THE departure on Thursday of Mr Joseph Perella, co-founder of Wasserstein Perella, to 'seek new challenges', breaks up a legendary Wall Street partnership. Suddenly, for the firm that created such seminal 1980s deals as the creation of Time Warner and Philip Morris' takeover of Kraft, the future looks far from settled. Perella, a 51-year-old accountant, has always portrayed a low-key image, both inside and outside the firm. It was Bruce Wasserstein, the former lawyer and renowned deal-maker, who stole the limelight. The two had worked together for 16 years, turning First Boston in to the top US mergers and acquisitions adviser before leaving to set up on their own five years ago. Perella's departure will further shake up what has become a seriously weakened advisory business. The failure of a number of the highly-leveraged deals it helped put together, such as the Campeau department store chain, has undermined the firm's reputation in a shrunken market. To some, 'Wasserella' has become synonymous with all the worst excesses of the takeover boom. During the first half of this year, the firm ranked a lowly 35th in the league table of advisers to US M&amp;A transactions, with just seven transactions valued at Dollars 270m to its credit, according to Securities Data. This is a far cry from its 1989 heyday as the third-ranked adviser in the biggest ever US takeover boom. Perella's split with Wasserstein has been in the air for some time, according to people close to the firm. One former top executive who recently left says: 'Personally, they were always very close. Joe was extremely effective at winning business; Bruce was good at doing deals. But particularly in the last couple of years, when things started to go awry, there have been a lot of arguments.' He says Perella has grown increasingly angry at the adverse publicity the firm has attracted, which he blames on Wasserstein. He is given to frequent outbursts of temper, much of it directed at his long-standing partner. As the firm's chairman, he also had to deal with growing pressures created by the decline in advisory work and growth of other businesses. This has been particularly true of the trading of junk (sub-investment grade) bonds, a business which first boomed and collapsed with the leveraged buy-out boom of the late 1980s, but which has made a come-back on Wall Street. According to one inside estimate, Grantchester, the firm's junk bond trading arm headed by William Begley, has made operating profits of between Dollars 20m and Dollars 25m a year in the last two years. 'As always happens on Wall Street, as Begley's group did better, they began strutting around,' says the former executive. The demands for more power and a larger share of the firm's profits are reported to have angered Perella. The management shake-up following Perella's departure could help to ease these tensions. Begley was named deputy chairman yesterday, while two other top executives - Charles Ward and Gary Parr - were appointed co-presidents. Wasserstein himself has become chairman. However, Perella's departure will intensify pressure on the firm's M&amp;A business. While Wasserstein built up an unrivalled reputation in the late 1980s for his robust deal-making, Perella was the relationship banker, bringing in new business and maintaining links with big US companies and, increasingly, those abroad. James Van Meter, chief financial officer of Georgia-Pacific, the US's biggest paper group and among Wasserstein Perella biggest customers, said: 'There is absolutely no way an organisation of which Joe Perella is a part can help but be substantially weakened by his departure - he is a premier banker.' The departure also raises questions about the firm's ownership. The two founding partners are understood to have held a majority of the shares before a Dollars 100m investment by Nomura, which took their stake down to close to 40 per cent. Of this, Wasserstein is understood to hold the largest portion, with Perella's interest between 15 and 20 per cent. A spokesman for Wasserstein Perella says the 20 per cent stake held by Nomura is locked in by agreement for at least another three years. Nomura, though, says the original five-year agreement runs out next month, and that any extension beyond that has only been a 'gentleman's agreement'. With questions hanging over two big shareholdings, the future for a former Wall Street legend remains far from clear.</p>

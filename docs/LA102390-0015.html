			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN JOSE;  </P> <P> STUDENTS SUSPECTED IN DORMITORY FIRE  </P> <P> Several suspects have been identified as responsible for a fire that swept  through a San Jose State dormitory, critically injuring two students and  sending 19 others to hospitals, officials said. "The suspects university police  are looking at are all San Jose students," university spokesman Dick Stanley  said.  </P> <P> Stanley said the suspects in Friday's fire, whose names he did not release, are  believed to have moved a couch in front of a dormitory room and ignited it. One  student, unable to breathe because of the thick smoke that filled Andrew  Moulder Hall, suffered a back fracture in a jump from a third-floor window.  Other students trapped by the flames leaned out windows, screaming for help as  firefighters set up ladders to rescue them. Rescuers led other students down  stairways to safety. More than 30 firefighters put out the blaze at the hall,  which houses 178 residents.  </P></p>

Foreign news agencies have reported at least  66 dead and more than 160 injured in the explosion.    In a statement released on Saturday evening, the ministry  said that "this criminal act, which follows an earlier  established pattern, is a heavy blow to the peace process."  "We appeal to all factors of the peace process not to permit  any political or media manipulation of this tragic event and to  invest firm and unbiased efforts to establish the truth, prevent  any obstruction of the peace process and show determination in  the effort to reach just and lasting peace in former Bosnia-  Herzegovina," the statement said.</p>

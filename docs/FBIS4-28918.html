			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta -- ETHNIC Chinese-owned business groups in  Indonesia together with the country's security authorities, have  launched a campaign to improve their image and their relations  with the public, say executives of Chinese-owned companies.    The move follows outbreaks of rioting and public criticism  in  recent months over the gap between the rich and poor, and which  culminated in rumours of violence two weeks ago.    Informal meetings have been held in several cities between  military leaders and businessmen, focusing on observing the  legal minimum wage and improving the treatment of employees.    Companies also agreed last week to take part in a community  development programme.    Ethnic Chinese business leaders have welcomed the army's  promise to protect them from any violence.    The companies have made commitments to pay the minimum wage,  with many noting that when transport, food and medical payments  are included, many workers receive more than the minimum.    In Surabaya, for instance, where minimum wages are 3,200  rupiah a day, workers normally receive an additional 2,500  rupiah in allowances plus annual bonuses. The companies say the  government accepts that a minimum wage of 7,000 rupiah a day  would not be economic.    Meetings have stressed the need for the ethnic Chinese-owned  companies to pay salaries on time and to treat indigenous  Indonesians with respect, in a polite and professional way.    Military and local government officials are also  establishing  a programme of social and community involvement under which  companies are seen to be publicly supporting the community,  especially its poorer members.    Projects will include supply of bathroom and toilet  facilities in poor villages, building of kindergartens, and help  with medical items such as spectacles for the poor.    Companies have been told that they must involve themselves  in  charitable and sponsorship activities so that they are not seen  as only interested in making profits.    Company executives, who remain cautious about the  possibility  of outbreaks of violence, say that the measures are a positive  way to reduce the perception of unfairness.    "The behaviour is the important thing," says one company  chairman. "We are all Indonesians working together for our  company and good work should be rewarded with good pay and  professional treatment. "    Younger ethnic Chinese executives say they have integrated  too deeply into Indonesian society to consider leaving, even if  there is racial trouble.    "We have to be patient, and take a low-key approach," says  one business leader when asked about allegations of arrogance by  wealthy ethnic Chinese displaying their success with big houses  and luxury cars.</p>

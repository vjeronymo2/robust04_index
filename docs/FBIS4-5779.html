			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 14 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Russia  on Thursday agreed to handle the issue of North Korean loggers  in Russia from the approach of humanitarianism and in deference  to their personal wish.    The agreement was reached in a Moscow meeting between  visiting South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and his  Russian counterpart, Andrey Kozyrev.    The two ministers also discussed the question of President  Kim Yong-sam's planned visit to Moscow in June.    Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong said in Seoul that  during  the meeting, Minister Han asked Kozyrev to give positive  assistance in case those North Korean loggers who had escaped  Pyongyang-run logging yards in Siberia wish to come to South  Korea.    "Minister Han also stressed that escaped North Korean  loggers  should not be repatriated to North Korea against their will,  asking Russia to see to it they remain under Russia's legal  protection," Hong said.    The vice minister said Minister Kozyrev made it clear that  Russia will positively cooperate in having North Korean loggers  lawfully go to a country or countries of their choice.    They also agreed on the need to obtain cooperation from the  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) so as to  buttress the fairness and objectivity of the way North Korean  loggers will be handled.    On President Kim's official visit to Russia, the two  ministers in effect confirmed the time of his visit, June this  year, and discussed the agenda topics of a Korea-Russia summit  meeting to be held during kim's visit, Vice Minister Hong said.</p>

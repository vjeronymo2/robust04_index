			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / High-tech goes hands-on: New biometric weapons against fraud Losses through fraud at automated teller machines are small change compared with the broad sweep of plastic card fraud which cost Britain's banks Pounds 165m last year. But winning the battle against all card fraud is the chief aim behind an impressive range of technological weapons being developed by financial institutions and their technology suppliers. Sending transaction details from the ATM, or point-of-sale device, to the bank is now thought to be secure thanks to 'black boxes' which encode the information and self-destruct if tampered with. The greatest problem is verifying that a card holder is the person that he or she claims to be. Customers in future may have to present a finger tip or an entire hand for inspection by an electronic 'eye' incorporated in the ATM. ('Fingerscan' rather than 'fingerprint' is the preferred term these days among bankers concerned about possible complaints of infringement of civil liberties.) Facial structure, voice, the pattern of blood vessels in the hand, or the back of the eye are all fair game for the emerging science of biometrics, which reckons to make positive identifications of individuals through unique measurements. Video cameras no larger than a computer chip make such measurements a practical proposition. To inspire confidence in both retailers and cardholders, however, a system of biometrics would have to be both convenient and reliable. None of those so far tested meets the banks' minimum standard  - of not more than one false diagnosis in 100,000 transactions. More stringent criteria may be needed in future. According to Mr Paul Rogers, UK product manager for NCR, the US company which leads the world ATM market (but designs and makes them in Dundee, Scotland), the UK banks will continue to rely on the familiar and inexpensive magnetic strip cards and personal identification, or Pin, numbers, but are likely to add a biometric element. Measurement of hand dimensions is a popular option because the details can be stored in the card itself. 'Smart' cards, containing a microprocessor, are difficult to forge and can hold substantial amounts of information about the cardholder including, say, an electronic facial image. They cost, however, several pounds, compared with pence for a magnetic stripe card. Customers leave more than fingerprints when they shop. Banks in the US are already using pattern recognition software which detects changes in a customer's shopping habits. If a habitual teetotaller seems suddenly to start buying red wine, for example, it could indicate that a stolen card is being used for the purchases.</p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / International Company News: Kleinwort Benson in Indian fund venture Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank, is joining forces with Tata Group, India's largest private sector conglomerate, to establish a new fund management company. The joint venture, Tata Asset Management Company, is 20 per cent owned by Kleinwort and 80 per cent by Tata Sons, the group holding company, and Investment Corporation of India, also a Tata company. The venture is taking advantage of a liberalisation in the Indian fund management business which until recently was dominated by the state-owned Unit Trust of India. About 20 companies are planning fund management arms, some with foreign backing. The new venture plans to launch a closed-end mutual fund during the first quarter of the year. Mr Derek Condon, a Kleinwort executive who will be managing director based in Bombay, said the venture would be aimed principally at the domestic Indian market, particularly the growing middle class population. Kleinwort estimates that economic reform is producing an increase in the number of new retail investors of between 2m and 3m people per year and that they are increasingly turning to the capital markets.</p>

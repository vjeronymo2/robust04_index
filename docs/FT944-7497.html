			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / National Grid raises payout to recs 17% The National Grid, the England and Wales power transmission company, is to increase its interim dividend to the regional electricity companies (recs) which own it by 17 per cent to Pounds 54m. The Grid is expected to be floated on the stock exchange next summer. The rise is in spite of a 6 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 285.3m to Pounds 267.1m. The profits fall was partly the result of a Pounds 33.3m premium paid on the early redemption of Pounds 300m of government debt. Analysts warned against drawing strong conclusions about the full-year dividend. However most said the results were in line, or slightly above expectations, after taking one-off factors into account. Most analysts were impressed by a 10 per cent cut in controllable costs at the core business. The flotation price of the company will depend on how much debt the recs put into the National Grid but one analyst said Pounds 4.2bn seemed the base figure with the likelihood that it could be as high as Pounds 5bn. The recs are discussing flotation plans with the government, which holds a golden share in the National Grid, and are likely to announce details of a flotation within the next few months. The flotation is likely to take the form of a demerger whereby shareholders in the recs would be given new shares in the Grid. The recs are expected to load the company with debt of about Pounds 750m to help pay a Pounds 1bn tax bill and consumer rebates of more than Pounds 200m. Mr David Jefferies, Grid chairman, refused to comment on the flotation, saying no decisions had been made. In the six months to September 30, operating profits rose from Pounds 310.1m to Pounds 322m on turnover of Pounds 674.9m (Pounds 686.9m). The company said that if the debt redemption premium and its effects were excluded from the results, the underlying increase in pre-tax profits was 4.1 per cent. Capital expenditure was Pounds 186.9m, up Pounds 13m on last year, and of this Pounds 89m related to Energis, the telecommunications company being built by the Grid. The comparable spending on Energis last year was Pounds 30m. Energis made a loss during the period of Pounds 19.2m, against a loss of Pounds 4.8m. Staff numbers, excluding Energis fell 8.8 per cent to 4,612. Mr Jefferies said about 4,300 was likely by the year-end. Net debt was Pounds 135.4m at September 30.</p>

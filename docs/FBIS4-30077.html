			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- Leaders of Japanese  small-business groups on Thursday [23 June] urged the government  to take strong remedial measures against the unabated strength  of the yen against the dollar, a Trade Ministry official said.    The latest surge of the yen is chilling the sentiment of  managers at small companies at a time when the Japanese economy  is showing signs of picking up, the leaders of the four groups  told International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata, the  official said.    The four groups, including the National Federation of Small  Business Associations, made the request during a breakfast  meeting with Hata and other top officials at the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry (MITI).    The groups called for strong dollar-buying market  intervention by Japan and other major countries as one way to  help arrest the yen's upswing, the MITI official told reporters.    Hata told the business leaders he is gravely concerned about  possible serious effects of the strong yen on small companies.    MITI will do its best to help small firms tide over the  strong yen, Hata was quoted as saying.</p>

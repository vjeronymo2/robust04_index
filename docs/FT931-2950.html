			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / International Company News: Tungsram fails to shine for GE - Nicholas Denton finds the US investment has yet to produce results GENERAL Electric of the US paved the way for western investors in eastern Europe when it took over Hungary's Tungsram lighting maker in 1990. Relishing its coup at taking over one of the region's few industrial stars, GE ran advertisements boasting of being part of a 'brilliant future.' Three years later, the brilliance remains a distant prospect. It is obscured by three annual losses at the Hungarian venture which have wiped out Tungsram's equity and prompted yesterday's announcement of a further Ft17bn (Dollars 195m) capital injection. The infusion will take GE's investment in Hungary over Dollars 500m - far more than the US company envisaged when, in 1990, it broke the path for western investors in eastern Europe by paying Dollars 150m for an initial 50 per cent stake in Tungsram. Tungsram's losses jumped 70 per cent to Ft9bn in 1992, on an unaudited international accounting basis, the largest in Hungarian corporate history. There is little prospect of a swift improvement. Fresh capital will allow Tungsram to ease its international borrowings of Dollars 200m and interest burden. But GE forecast the unit would remain in the red this year. GE says the 1994 target is to match the operating margins of Philips and Osram, the market leaders in European lighting. But the company refuses to make a forecast about a return to overall profitability for Tungsram. 'We've got a hill to climb here,' admits Mr Charles Pieper, chief executive of GE Lighting Europe. So what has gone wrong? GE said restructuring was to blame for the deterioration in the results. Cost inflation cancelled out the benefit of productivity growth of 14 per cent in 1992 which saved Ft3.5bn. Tungsram took in roughly equal measure charges from its withdrawal from non-core businesses outside lightmaking, accelerated layoffs, a write-off of old, bad Russian debts and increased borrowing costs because of the build-up of losses and debt. Tungsram has also been caught up in the economic crisis in eastern Europe. Its regional market has shrunk by 90 per cent with the disintegration of Comecon, the communist trading bloc, while the recession in Hungary has left domestic demand stagnant. But, most painfully for an exporter like Tungsram, the Hungarian government has encouraged the Forint to appreciate in real terms to tame inflation. Tungsram has been a prime mover within the Hungarian Association of International Companies, the multinational investors' lobby group, for accelerated devaluation. But no other western investor is as dependent on exports as GE is with Tungsram, and so it is difficult to mobilise support. To cap it all, prices for lighting products in Tungsram's main market of western Europe, where it has a 6 per cent to 7 per cent share, have until recently been falling, depressed by recession and fierce competition from rivals Philips and Siemens's Osram. The gloomy environment makes GE's move to recapitalise Tungsram, which will take the US company's investment from Dollars 350m to over Dollars 500m, all the more striking. The infusion is a token of GE's commitment to Tungsram, say executives. GE points to its achievements of the last three years at Tungsram as the reasons for its continuing faith in the company's future. Productivity has improved dramatically since GE took over. Sales have risen by half since 1989 to Ft31bn in 1992, while the number of employees has fallen 18,000 to 10,200. GE forecasts further improvement in productivity of 20 per cent in 1993 after 14 per cent growth last year. GE has also hived off peripheral businesses, halved the number of levels in the hierarchy, and halved the turnround time between order and delivery. The new owners have also taken investment from 1 to 2 per cent of sales to over 5 per cent. GE has built a Dollars 30m greenfield plant in Nagykanizsa in western Hungary to concentrate worldwide production of compact fluorescent lamps. Impressed with researchers at Tungsram, GE Lighting has established in Hungary four of the division's nine technology centres around the world. GE has even overcome the initial cultural gap within the management, most notably appointing Hungarian Mr Miklos Csapody to head technology for the whole of GE Lighting Europe, which includes Thorn of the UK as well as Tungsram. What could have been done better? 'We could have gone faster,' admits Mr Charles Pieper, chief executive officer of GE Lighting Europe. Now GE has pressed the accelerator pedal. The company has put Mr Pieper in direct control of Tungsram and sidelined the former chief executive officer. He recently announced 900 additional job losses and a drive to reduce prices charged by suppliers. Mr Pieper characterises as 'aggressive patience' the attitude of Mr Jack Welch, the GE group's chief executive. GE can only hope that Tungsram's future is brilliant enough to be worth the wait.</p>

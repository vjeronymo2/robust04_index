			<p>BFN     [Text] After May 30 Russian strategic nuclear-armed  missiles will not be targeted against sites situated on the  territory of the United States and Great Britain,  Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Strategic Rocket Forces  Colonel General Igor Sergeyev reported to Interfax on Thursday.    In his words, the missiles which were earlier targeted  against the United States and Great Britain, will not be  targeted against any site in the world. Sergeyev reported that  earlier the command considered the possibility of re-targeting  strategic missiles at points in the open sea. "However, we have  chosen not to target them at any point," he said.    Sergeyev pointed out that non-targeting of Russian missiles  is being implemented in accordance with the Declaration on  Organization of Daily Activity of Strategic Nuclear Forces with  Non-Targeted Missiles signed by Russian and American Presidents  Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton on January 14, 1994 in Moscow.  On February 14 Boris Yeltsin and British Prime Minister John  Major signed a joined statement on joining this Declaration.    Sergeyev expressed conviction that by May 30 American and  British strategic missiles would "not be targeted against  Russian sites either."    "This will raise the threshold of nuclear security in the  world," Sergeyev asserts.</p>

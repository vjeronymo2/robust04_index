			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Environmental Protection Yuriy </F> Kostenko by Oleksandra Oksanchuk; place and date not given:  ``Nuclear Lobby Begins `Rebuilding Communism;''' -- first  paragraph is VECHIRNIY KYYIV introduction]    [Text] The edict by the Ukrainian president from 23  February ``On Urgent Measures To Develop Nuclear Power Industry,  To Set Up Nuclear Fuel Cycle in Ukraine,'' which VECHIRNIY KYYIV  has already reported on, generated many responses and questions  by our readers. How unsafe will the development of nuclear power  plants be? The Chernobyl tragedy is still our current problem,  it has not fallen into oblivion. We asked Minister of  Environmental Protection Yuriy Kostenko to comment on this issue.    Kostenko: First, I state that this presidential  edict was adopted without any cooperation with the ministries  and departments -- the Ministries of Health and Environmental  Protection, the State Committee for Problems of Consequences of  the Chernobyl Catastrophe, and the State Committee for Control  Over Nuclear Power Industry -- which are responsible for the  state of the nuclear, radiological, and ecological safety. This  edict is a vivid example of how the executive power -- our  president -- violates the Ukrainian legislation and is under the  nuclear lobby's thumb. The edict itself is absolutely  inexpedient from both economical and ecological viewpoints.    I will begin with the economy. A lot is being written and  said about the nuclear power industry being much cheaper than  the electric one. As practice shows, electrical energy produced  by the U. S. nuclear power plants is 1.5 times more expensive  than the energy produced by thermal power stations. Why? For  the first thing, high demands concerning nuclear safety  considerably increase the costs and main expenses. For the  second thing, companies which own nuclear power plants  participate in special funds for establishing nuclear waste  sites. For the third thing, each nuclear plant should be closed  down and neutralized after having worked to the end of its  operating life. To implement these conditions, a special fund  should be established which will have to include tariffs for  electric energy costs. Finally, any state which has nuclear  power plants should establish a national nuclear waste site  which is an extremely expensive undertaking. In the United  States, costs for carrying out scientific research for drafting  criteria for establishing such waste sites stood at over $1.5  billion, while building costs of the nuclear waste site were  estimated at more than $6 billion.    One more important point. According to the concept of the  development of the nuclear power industry in Ukraine, we are  planning to begin using ``KANDU'' nuclear reactors produced in  Canada. They are safer than Russian ones. In addition, they can  use the natural uranium and we can stop buying the concentrated  uranium in Russia. Why should we build imperfect reactors? Is  this advantageous for someone?    Oksanchuk: However, deliveries of Russian nuclear  fuel to Ukraine is one of the conditions for our disarmament,  one of the provisions of a tripartite Moscow agreement.  Currently, only we are keeping to this agreement....    Kostenko: This is the thing. Though, we have  delivered 120 warheads to Russia, we are still waiting for  Russian deliveries of the concentrated uranium. When the  Supreme Soviet discussed disarmament issues, the matter of  establishing a joint enterprise for dismantling armaments and  the further use of the concentrated uranium for the nuclear  power industry was raised. This would have been more  advantageous for Ukraine than obtaining nuclear fuel from  Russia. For example, the costs of an enterprise -- which  ``General Electric'' promised to build with us -- to dismantle  ammunition and transform the highly concentrated uranium to the  low concentrated variety would have stood at $25-35 billion.  The United States' financial support for our disarmament could  have been used for this purpose. Therefore, it would have cost  nothing for Ukraine to set up such a joint enterprise. If the  Ukrainian nuclear power industry begins operating ``KANDU''  reactors, we will have enough nuclear fuel -- extracted from  warheads -- for over 150-200 years. Currently, we give back  everything and receive only partial compensation which will  cover our demands for only three-five years.    In my opinion, no economic crisis can justify the operation  of the second Chernobyl reactor. God forbid the next accident!  Otherwise, this portion of the Ukrainian soil will forever  become a radiological cemetery.    In Zaporozhie, where the sixth nuclear reactor will be put  into operation soon, the nuclear power plant is located close to  the thermal electric plant. Discharges from the thermal  electric plant mix with an enormous quantity of steam discharged  from the nuclear power plant and cause oxide rains. This region  which is very important in the production of agricultural  products is experiencing a serious ecological crisis because  oxide rains devastate everything. It is necessary to estimate  what is cheaper: operating a nuclear plant or producing high  quality agricultural products.    The Rovno nuclear power plant was probably built on  karstenite cavities. Expenses to underpin the foundation of  this nuclear plant have already exceeded the planned expenses of  this site by 40 percent.    The aforementioned presidential edict also includes a clause  which foresees putting into operation a new block at the South  Ukrainian nuclear power plant. To put it into operation, a big  reservoir should be built because the low water in the Yuzhnyy  Bug River does not allow the effective cooling of the reactor.  This reservoir will cover large territories. This situation  has already been discussed twice by sessions of ecological  experts: The first one was held in the time of the former USSR;  the second one -- recently, by our ministry. Both inspections  stated the inexpediency of setting up one more reservoir because  picturesque landscapes will be covered with water and the  ecological balance will be disturbed. In general, all this can  lead to the death of the river. The situation will likely  resemble that of the Dnieper cascade, where reservoirs turned  into stinking bogs.    Therefore, I state that the implementation of this edict  will  have one result: Ukraine will be economically ruined and the  ecological situation in the Republic will be greatly aggravated;  if we continue operating our nuclear power plants, the  consequences can become really unpredictable.    Oksanchuk: You opposed and are opposing our  president. However, I will vote for you and my next question is  as follows: If my Supreme Council candidate cannot do anything  now when he is a minister, what will he do in the Supreme  Council?    Kostenko: I am sincere: I owe everything that I  have done within the ministry only to my deputy status. I have  always opposed antiecological decisions. (A minister who  opposes the government is not welcome there.) Do you remember  the situation when Lanovyy began opposing the president, and was  immediately dismissed? I used my deputy status to oppose the  passing of the antiecological law by the government. However,  there are limits to everything. Currently, it is difficult to  speak about any results when the state management of the  environmental protection branch has not undergone any reforms.  Reforms will be possible when the Supreme Council adopts  corresponding decisions. Therefore, I am running in the  elections because the office of the minister does not enable me  to proceed with ecological reforms. I am pinning my hopes on  the new Supreme Council which -- if our people make the  appropriate choice -- will first and foremost think about the  future strong and independent Ukraine with clean fresh winds and  water, green forests, and a healthy population.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Ushuaia, 27 May (NA) -- Tierra del Fuego  Governor Jose Estabillo (MOPOF) [Tierra del Fuego Popular  Movement] emphasized today that "there is no chance of a social  explosion" in the province. He said the conflict that provoked  the mobilization of hundreds of metalworkers will be resolved  before 30 May.    Estabillo said: "We do not have 1,700 people thrown into the  streets as some newspapers said." The governor recognized,  however, that "there is a problem, but it is limited to two or  three companies."    He said: "Workers and managers are discussing the situation.  The government is mediating, doing its best to find a solution."    The governor added that the metalworkers "did not respect  the  order of compulsory conciliation decreed by the Labor Ministry,"  after the Ushuaia Branch of the UOM [Metalworkers Union] decided  to stage an indefinite strike. [passage omitted]    Estabillo recognized: "The climate in the province is tense"  because the factory sector is very important -- it employs  nearly 5,500 people, adding that "other supporters gradually  joined the demonstration."    Regarding the case of workers who took over a factory,  Estabillo said: "This incident involved the Crown company  following the dismissal of 15 workers." The governor urged  workers to respect a court ruling.    Estabillo said that despite the important increase in  production of color television sets -- from 300,000 sets in 1990  to 1,600,000 last year -- there is a crisis in the industry due  to "commercial factors and the increased demand during the run  up to the world soccer competition, which is not up to  entrepreneurs' expectations."    Estabillo said: "Entrepreneurs have complained about the  policy permitting the unrestricted import of electronic  products, which is producing strong competition for national  industries in Tierra del Fuego."    The governor added: "Industrial retooling takes time and  effort," stressing "the political willingness of the economy  minister to change the tax burden on Tierra del Fuego  entrepreneurs."    The governor denied asking the Border Police to intervene,  assuring that "the situation is being controlled by the  provincial police."</p>

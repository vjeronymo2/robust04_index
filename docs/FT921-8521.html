			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Musawi killing likely to promote Shia extremism THE killing of Sheikh Abbas Musawi, the leader of the Lebanese Hizbollah, by Israeli helicopter gunships yesterday is likely to favour the re-emergence of more extreme elements in the Shia Moslem movement and destabilise the fragile political consensus in Lebanon. Sheikh Abbas, who acceded to the leadership of the 'Party of God' in May of last year, presided over the Hizbollah through the denouement of the western hostage crisis. Unlike his predecessor, Sheikh Sobhi Tofeili, he said the hostage-taking had been a mistake. In recent interviews he spoke of the possibility of participating in mainstream Lebanese politics, even saying he could envisage the day when Hizbollah would elect deputies to parliament and have cabinet ministers to defend the interests of Lebanese Shia. Only last month, Sheikh Abbas defused a crisis between the Lebanese army and Hizbollah, personally visiting army officers in Tyre after pro-Israeli Maronite Christian officers ordered the arrest of Hizbollah fighters during a funeral service for guerrillas killed in southern Lebanon. A soft-spoken cleric, born 38 years ago in the Bekaa Valley village of Nabihsheet, Sheikh Abbas wore the black turban of a sayyid or descendant of the prophet Mohamed. Like his mentor, Sheikh Mohamed Hussein Fadlallah, he studied in the southern Iraqi city of Najaf, seat of Shia theology. A photograph of Iranian president Hashemi Rafsanjani sat on the desk of his office in Beirut's Bir-El-Abed district. Asked in a recent interview whether it was true that Hizbollah had broken links with Hojatolislam Ali-Akbar Mohtashemi, the former Iranian minister of the Interior who founded the Lebanese movement, Sheikh Abbas responded: 'Our links are with the government of Iran - not with individuals.' Mr Rafsanjani's government negotiated the release of the last remaining British and American hostages; Mohtashemi's parliamentary faction is known to have opposed the resolution of the hostage crisis. On the question of the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon and the continued imprisonment of more than 200 Shia Moslems by Israel in Khiam prison in southern Lebanon, Sheikh Abbas was implacable. He constantly demanded the liberation of Sheikh Abdul-Karim Obeid, the Hizbollah cleric who was kidnapped by Israeli troops in July 1989. 'Our hatred for Israel will never change,' he said. While the Lebanese government disarmed other militias last year, he obtained a special status for the Hizbollah by convincing the Lebanese and Syrian governments that Hizbollah was a 'resistance movement' which could not be disbanded before Israel ended its occupation of southern Lebanon. Sheikh Abbas came close to claiming the October 1983 attacks against US Marines and French paratroopers of the multinational force. 'The greatest achievement of Hizbollah during this period was to evict the multinational force from Lebanon,' he said. Under Sheikh Abbas, Hizbollah improved its sometimes confrontational relationship with Damascus, and Syria is certain to be enraged by his murder. By encouraging the Hizbollah to attack the Israelis and their proxy militia forces in southern Lebanon, the Syrians retained a valuable bargaining card in their negotiations with Israel. In the aftermath of Sheikh Abbas's death, Israel stands little chance of retrieving the bodies of several servicemen still missing in Lebanon or of obtaining the freedom of Israeli airman Ron Arad. Arad was captured by an Amal militiaman when his aircraft was shot down over Sidon in 1985. When the militiaman defected to the rival Hizbollah, he took his Israeli prisoner with him. Sheikh Abbas's killing can only worsen the security situation in Lebanon. A leading member of Islamic Jihad, a Hizbollah offshoot, predicted last autumn that attacks against western interests would resume if the Israelis continued to kidnap Shias in southern Lebanon. Six men were abducted by the Israelis from Sheikh Obeid's village of Jibsheet last month, three of whom were later released. Sheikh Abbas Musawi was a relative moderate in an extremist movement. His violent death will provoke demands for revenge. And if the Hizbollah cannot attack the Israelis directly, they may vent their rage on easier targets.</p>

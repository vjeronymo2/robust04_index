			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Canberra raises deficit forecast AUSTRALIA'S federal budget deficit is expected to reach ADollars 9.3bn (Pounds 3.97bn) in the year to the end of June, the government said yesterday. The forecast is nearly double the budget estimate published in August, and ADollars 2.5bn higher than the last revision three months ago. Mr Paul Keating, Labor prime minister, announced the revised forecast during talks with state leaders on planned reforms to financial and administrative links between Canberra and the states. He said the deterioration was caused by a shortfall in tax receipts, and forecast a further rise in the deficit to ADollars 10.5bn for 1992-93. The government expects the budget to return to surplus in 1995-96. The 1992-93 deficit will be the biggest in cash terms since the mid-1950s. However, at about 2.4 per cent of gross domestic product, it will fall far short of the record 4.75 per cent deficit accumulated by the last Labor government in 1974-75. The government said the revision reflected a shortfall in tax revenue caused by administrative changes, poor forecasting, and a slower than expected recovery from recession. Mr John Hewson, the federal opposition leader, said the revision would increase pressure on Mr Keating to hold the election by the end of this year; it must be held by mid-1993. Mr Keating told state premiers that the deficit increase would not permit a reversal of cuts in federal transfers which the states blame for their aggregate debt of ADollars 7bn. He also rejected proposals for a guaranteed share of federal tax revenues, and told the states to ease their financial problems by increasing efficiency and cutting costs. However, the government agreed to consider increasing the predictability of state funding by switching to a three-year financing regime. The two sides will produce a joint study of state finances before the next round of talks in June.</p>

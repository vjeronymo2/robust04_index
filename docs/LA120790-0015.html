			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRADE BETWEEN U.S., MEXICO  </P> <P> As the author of the Americas Watch Report on Human Rights in Mexico referred  to in the interview with President Salinas (Opinion, Nov. 25), I would like to  correct a misleading impression left by him concerning improvements in human  rights conditions in his country.  </P> <P> Certainly the creation of a National Human Rights Commission and the proposing  of new legislation to reduce the incidence of torture by police are positive  developments. But the case President Salinas selected to illustrate the human  rights improvements made by his administration in fact reveals that these  improvements are more cosmetic than real.  </P> <P> The case involves Mexican attorney Antonio Valencia Fontes who was arrested in  Mexicali on Nov. 22, 1989, by federal judicial anti-narcotics officers. He  alleges that he was tortured and coerced into confessing to crimes he did not  commit. The attorney general has denied that Valencia was in federal custody  prior to Nov. 27. The Human Rights Commission investigated Valencia's case and  determined that the earlier arrest date was probable. It called on the attorney  general to investigate whether his human rights had been violated by the  police. Enrique Alvarez del Castillo refused.  </P> <P> Valencia Fontes remains in jail, the police officers who illegally detained and  tortured him are still on duty.  </P> <P> It is time for President Salinas to demonstrate that he is serious about  halting human rights abuses. He must insist that the recommendations of his  National Human Rights Commission be carried out -- even when that means  releasing alleged criminals whose human rights were violated during their  arrests. He must punish police officers and their commanders who engage in  torture, incommunicado detention and other serious abuses. And, having hinted  that he has done so already, he should immediately take steps to ensure  Valencia Fontes' release.  </P> <P> ELLEN L. LUTZ  </P> <P> California Director, Human Rights Watch  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

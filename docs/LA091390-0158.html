			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTCHESTER MARKS 50TH YEAR;  </P> <P> RESIDENTS SAY SMALL-TOWN VALUES STILL PRESENT IN THEIR CITY  </P> <P> In the midst of hog farms and fields of beans and barley back in 1940, four  developers began to build houses on a 3,000-acre tract that bordered a small  airstrip called Mines Field.  </P> <P> A real estate ad a short while later described the area as "climatically  perfect . . . only a few minutes' drive to the beaches (and) only one-half hour  to downtown." Two-bedroom houses, complete with garage, paved streets and  "sewers to every lot" sold for $3,840 -- with $95 down.  </P> <P> But that was then. Subdivisions bearing such names as Kentwood and Westport  Heights have long since grown together to become the sizable community of  Westchester, where homes generally cost $300,000 and up. The little airstrip  has grown up too -- it's now Los Angeles International Airport.  </P> <P> To mark its 50th anniversary, Westchester has launched a yearlong celebration  that began last weekend with a children's parade. Titled "Growing Up in  Westchester," Saturday's parade drew more than 500 youthful participants -- on  decorated bicycles, on roller skates, on foot and in strollers. The 10-minute  parade stopped traffic as it ran from Loyola Marymount University down Loyola  Boulevard to Westchester Recreation Center.  </P> <P> Some residents cited the parade as evidence that the small-town values of the  1940s are alive and well in Westchester.  </P> <P> "We are a family community -- like a little town in the Midwest, except we  happen to be attached to Los Angeles," said resident Karen Jacobs, whose family  has lived in Westchester for three generations.  </P> <P> "We've managed to keep a sense of community even though we're the gateway to  one of the largest airports in the world," said Mary Lou Crockett, a member of  the 50th anniversary committee.  </P> <P> "You can't go anywhere in Westchester and not see someone you know," added  Barbara Wetcel, who said she stayed in Westchester so her son could go to  Westport Heights Elementary, the school she attended.  </P> <P> Events commemorating the golden anniversary include a Pumpkin Fest, the annual  Jet to Jetty 5-K and 10-K race, and a Thanksgiving community worship service in  which local churches will gather for one service.  </P> <P> A silent auction and memorabilia exhibit will be held in January, and a country  fair is scheduled for May, when another parade of collector cars, bands and  drill teams will reverse the route of the children's parade. A movie marathon  of 1940s films and newsreels will be presented in June.  </P> <P> Artifacts and pictures of Westchester's history will be displayed in a special  room at the Loyola Marymount University library. At the end of the celebration  next September, a time capsule will be buried at a site yet to be chosen.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The quake that shook the San Francisco Bay area Monday was predicted by U.S.  Geological Survey scientists, said a USGS seismologist in Menlo Park. "We knew  there would be an earthquake here," said Al Lindh. "Honest we did." He said he  and his colleagues foresaw that a mile-long stretch of the Calaveras Fault was  due for a 9.5-kilometer-deep quake with a magnitude of just over 5, because  stress was building. The quake was slightly weaker than they expected. The USGS  measured it at 5.0, while University of California seismologists read it at  4.4. No major damage resulted and no injuries were reported.  </P></p>

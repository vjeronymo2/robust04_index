			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Hunt for Thames chief continues THAMES WATER confirmed yesterday that missing chairman Sir Roy Watts had known he was suffering from Parkinson's disease for two months, as the search for him entered its fourth day, Bronwen Maddox writes. Colleagues in the water industry said that he had been depressed following diagnosis of the illness, which many had suspected for months. Sir Roy, 67, has not contacted his family or Thames Water since his driver left him at his Battersea flat at 2pm on Tuesday. Police divers were reported to have searched the River Thames near his flat yesterday but found no trace.</p>

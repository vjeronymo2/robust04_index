			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BILLY SMITH TO RETIRE AS N.Y. GOALIE  </P> <P> Billy Smith, whose goaltending helped the New York Islanders to four straight  NHL titles, announced today that he is retiring as an active player to become  the team's goaltending coach.  </P> <P> Smith, 38, the league's oldest player last season, was an original Islander,  having been selected from the Los Angeles Kings when the team was formed in the  1972 expansion draft.  </P> <P> He had a career record of 305 wins, 233 losses and 105 ties and a goals-against  average of 3.17. His victory total ranks eighth on the NHL's all-time list.  </P> <P> On Nov. 28, 1979, Smith became the first NHL goalie to be credited with scoring  a goal when he was the last Islanders' player to touch the puck before a  Colorado player put it into an empty net.  </P> <P> Smith was known for his tough play around the net, amassing 484 penalty minutes  in 17 seasons.  </P> <P> "I thought Bill did a real fine job with our young goaltenders last season, and  we look forward to working with him in the future," General Manager Bill Torrey  said.  </P></p>

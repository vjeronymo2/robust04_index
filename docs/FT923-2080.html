			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Silver lining for dollar in clouds over the ERM THE MELTDOWN of the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) has shaken confidence throughout Europe, but left many US investors feeling more, rather than less, secure. The consensus view of Wall Street analysts is that the dollar has turned. The strong gains registered in the past week are widely seen as just the beginning of a sustained, if sometimes bumpy, recovery for the US currency. The Bundesbank's agreement last weekend to a quarter-point cut to 9.5 per cent in the Lombard rate is seen as the turning point. 'The principle was established that the Germans would respond to pressure,' says Mr David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey Lanston, the New York broker. At the meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries in Washington today , Mr Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, is expected to press hard for further cuts in German rates. Speaking in Washington yesterday, Mr Brady said lower interest rates in Europe were 'inevitable if that continent is to return to growth'. On Wall Street, the turmoil in the ERM is seen as bringing forward the timing of cuts in European rates. 'The breaking apart of EMS (European Monetary System) discipline will force larger interest rate cuts in Europe sooner than would otherwise have occurred,' says Mr Robert Giordano, chief US economist for Goldman Sachs, the investment bank. 'The dollar's appreciation reflects the fact that people are now more optimistic about German interest rate cuts,' agrees Mr Philip Suttle, an economist who follows European developments for JP Morgan, the New York bank. In the short run, exchange rate chaos in Europe has also served to enhance the dollar's status as a 'safe haven' currency. Ahead of tomorrow's French referendum on the Maastricht treaty, the future of European economic and monetary integration hangs in the balance. By contrast, a huge, politically stable, unified American market for exports and investment can be taken for granted. The safe haven argument for the dollar should not be exaggerated, however, because the US is facing one of the most open presidential elections in recent history. Financial analysts, moreover, are shifting to the view that Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic contender, will win. Normally, the prospect of a political shift from right to left would send tremors through financial markets and undermine the dollar. Such fears, however, are balanced by a recognition that it would be hard for Mr Clinton to perform less well economically than the incumbent. Mr Bush has not only presided over the slowest growth since Herbert Hoover, he has also lost control of federal spending and run up even larger budget deficits than did his predecessor, Ronald Reagan. The dollar is unlikely to appreciate without setbacks, however. US economic figures this week were weaker than expected, raising fresh doubts about the momentum of the domestic recovery. Retail sales and industrial production both fell by 0.5 per cent last month. There were mitigating circumstances: production was affected by Hurricane Andrew and the fall in retail sales was partly balanced by upward revisions for July. Nonetheless, these were hardly figures to inspire confidence. And some analysts think there is worse to come. Mr Geoffrey Dennis, a US-based economist for James Capel, the UK stockbroker, predicts very weak employment figures for September. The combination of soft economic numbers and the dollar's rebound is widely seen as increasing the pressure for US interest rate cuts. Early this month, the Federal Reserve shaved short-term interest rates by a quarter-point to 3 per cent, but was prevented from easing more aggressively by dollar weakness. Mr Jones at Aubrey Lanston thinks there is a 50:50 chance that poor employment figures would persuade the Fed to complete that easing move by signalling a half-point cut in the discount rate to 2.5 per cent early in October. The case against another cut, however, is that the Fed would not want to look politically partisan so close to an election. Without a prior easing of interest rates in Europe, a unilateral Fed move would also threaten another bout of instability on currency markets. Looking beyond current uncertainties, most US forecasters expect the US recovery to gather momentum next year. US interest rates are thus expected to begin firming within six months or so. At the same time, many US analysts believe European - and especially German - economic troubles are deeper than previously suspected. Perhaps naively, many expect German intransigence on interest rates to recede as recessionary forces become more evident. How much might the dollar rise in such circumstances? Mr Giordano at Goldman Sachs says that he would not be surprised if the dollar rose to DM1.60 within a few months. Purchasing power parity comparisons of relative price levels suggests the potential gains could eventually be much greater. In any case, movements against the D-Mark may understate the dollar's underlying strength. If the de facto outcome of this week's turmoil is a revaluation of the D-Mark in Europe, the dollar will appreciate faster against weak European currencies, such as sterling and the lira, than against the D-Mark. Whatever happens, another roller-coaster ride seems in store for the world's currency markets.</p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Belgrade's army fights in Bosnia Regular Yugoslav troops are being deployed in Bosnia, United Nations officers on the ground confirmed yesterday. In a week in which the international community has been criticised by senior UN officials for failing to stop the war in Bosnia, Norwegian Captain Jantora Strandas with the Nordic contingent, yesterday verified that Yugoslav army paratroopers are routinely engaged in hostilities in Bosnia. His comments refute claims by Serb leaders that they have not supported Bosnian Serb forces, who control 70 per cent of the republic. It also undermines demands this week by Belgrade for the lifting of sanctions, imposed 19 months ago over the violent partition of Bosnia. Observers and local residents have confirmed the long-term presence of Yugoslav army paratroopers and vehicles in northern and eastern Bosnia. 'Just stand in Zvornik (on the Bosnian-Serb frontier) and watch the Yugoslav army cross over,' Capt Strandas said yesterday at the UN Pancevo base, near Belgrade. His remarks follow a scathing denunciation of the UN by outgoing commander of UN Protection Forces in Bosnia, Belgian General Francis Briquemont, for a 'fantastic gap' between resolutions and the political will to carry them out. By way of illustration of the powerlessness of Unprofor against Serbian intransigence, Capt Strandas pointed to 11 German-made Leopard tanks. For three months, the tanks with their 105mm guns, have stood idle in an open shed, even though 'they need exercise,' he said. Bosnian Serb leaders reneged on their pledge to allow the Leopards to cross frontlines to support UN troops in Tuzla, a government stronghold in north-eastern Bosnia, surrounded by Serb forces. So, instead of a three-hour trip, the tanks will go on a three-day rail journey from Pancevo, through Hungary, Austria, and Italy, a sea voyage across the Adriatic to Croatia and then a drive through disputed territory in central Bosnia. What's more, the UN is being asked to pay Dollars 1m to Belgrade for their passage through Serbia.</p>

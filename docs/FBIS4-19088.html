			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F> Basak Dogru in Istanbul on 12 April -- recorded, in English with  superimposed translation into Turkish]    [Text] [Dogru] What can you say about the current level  of relations between Turkey and Israel?    [Peres] I think they are full of promises for the future. I  have many hopes for the future, not only for our countries, but  also for the Middle East. We can work together in every field.  There is a broad potential for this. We can develop  cooperation especially in the economic, technological,  agricultural, defense, and tourism fields.    [Dogru] How do you see the future of the Middle East peace  process?    [Peres] I hope that the negotiations between the PLO and  Israel will be concluded by the end of this month and  implementation will begin at the beginning of May. The  implementation of the framework agreement will constitute the  first step toward a new Middle East.    [Dogru] There is a big massacre in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I  would like to hear your views on this subject.    [Peres] One must not approach the incidents in Bosnia as a  Muslim-Christian conflict. The only discrimination the  civilized world is allowed to do is the one between those who  are killed in this war, that is the victims, and those who cause  this shame. Civilized communities should side with the innocent  people who are killed for no reason. They should defend those  who do not even have the right to defend themselves because of  the embargo. We feel deep sorrow for the victims of this war.    [Dogru] What kind of a future awaits our world, which is  changing at a head-spinning pace? How can you describe Turkey's  place in this changing world?    [Peres] Turkey must leave the past behind and prepare for  the next century with its young population. The coming days  will be accompanied by many problems such as terrorism and the  environment. No country can look forward to a future without any  problems. We need more educated people to resolve these  problems. We must all invest more in educational institutions  and scientific research organizations.</p>

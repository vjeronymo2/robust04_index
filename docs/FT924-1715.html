			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Jubilee Line talks disappoint minister MR STEVE NORRIS, minister for transport in London, said yesterday he was 'disappointed' that agreement had not yet been reached between the government and the private sector on funding for the Jubilee Line extension. He emphasised in the Commons that there was 'good faith' on both sides in the negotiations. Mr Norris was responding to MPs' concern over the future of the plan to extend the London Underground line south-east to London's Docklands. He said: 'One of the stumbling blocks is that we are now dealing with a desperate bunch of people . . . American banks, Canadian banks, European banks . . . I hope to be able to have happier news in due course.' The 11 banks backing the scheme are pledged to provide Pounds 400m of the Pounds 1.8bn total cost with the government providing the rest.</p>

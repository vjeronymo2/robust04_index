			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "The Voz Andes Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Luis Trujillo, president of the Chamber of Commerce,  has said that the blockade, which ended yesterday after the Army  stepped in, caused losses to agricultural firms because they  were unable to take their products to markets. Trujillo said: We  have asked companies to inventory their losses. We can  anticipate that the economic losses exceed $200 million.    Many cities did not have communications for over one week  during the strike staged by the Confederation of Indian  Nationalities of Ecuador, Conaie, to protest the recent approval  of the agrarian reforms law. The blockade caused lack of food  supplies in some cities and it led to clashes between  demonstrators and residents who were affected by the blockade.  As a result of these clashes, four people were killed and 10  were wounded.    Trujillo says there is concern among businessmen about the  losses they have sustained. We want to make sure the country has  the necessary guarantees to allow the companies to operate, he  said.    President Sixto Duran Ballen, who declared a state of  military emergency on Tuesday to quell the Indian  demonstrations, said the Army will stay on the streets. We will  maintain troop mobilization as long as necessary, Duran Ballen  told newsmen. Duran Ballen said that the Army reopened highways  where many people were trapped for several days and that the  public forces had truly reestablished the flow of vehicles.    The president said it is necessary to maintain the state of  militarization because of the threat by several organizations  joining the Indian movement. The president said that other  organizations had announced strikes in support of the Indians.    The country's largest labor organization has called for a  general 24-hour strike this coming Tuesday to support the Indian  protest movement. The United Workers Front, FUT, called a strike  to demand that the government meet the demands of the workers,  the Indians, and peasants. A FUT communique says it demands the  repeal of the agrarian law, among a list of demands to improve  the living standards of the people.    President Sixto Duran Ballen said the law cannot be  repealed,  because it was approved by the executive and legislative  branches jointly and its elimination would leave all  agricultural activities without a regulation framework.    Conaie President Luis Macas said the Indian organizations  will continue to protest the new law, which they consider  harmful to their interests. According to several Indian  organizations, the new law eliminates agrarian reform  achievements and authorizes the government to confiscate  properties currently held by Indian to turn them over to wealthy  landlords.</p>

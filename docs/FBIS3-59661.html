			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The heavy particle beam cancer therapy device  (HIMAC) which was built by the National Institute of  Radiological Sciences (NIRS, Mr. Hirotoshi MATSUDAIRA, director)  of the STA has been completed and will be opened to related  researchers on the 13th. This equipment is a facility equipped  with the world's first medical dedicated use accelerator that  will irradiate cancer-afflicted areas by accelerating helium and  argon ions. Construction has been completed with a total  contribution of investments of &yen;32.6 billion since FY87. In  the future adjustments will be made to the beam line, and this  highly advanced device will go on line from March 1994, when  clinical therapy will begin.    Cancer therapies include surgery, chemotherapy and radiation  therapy, and while these aim at extermination of the cancer,  they are still not decisive. This new device represents the most  advanced technology for radiation therapy, and it can treat  cancer while sparing normal cells by narrowing the target to the  cancer-afflicted portion only. Currently, the Heavy Particle  Beam Therapy Network Conference, of which NIRS is a participant,  is making progress in planning for the treatment of cancers  afflicting specific areas, and treatment of the brain will begin  in March. Next, manuals for the treatment of the lungs and the  central nervous system will be made, and actual treatments for  all three areas will begin in FY94. In 1998, it is hoped that  there can be treatment for cancer afflicting 10 different areas.    For this purpose, the STA has plans to construct a custom  hospital which will be an approximately 100-bed facility that  has five stories above ground and one below ground. The STA  expects to invest &yen;12.9 billion in this, and begin  construction in FY94. Also, a Heavy Particle Beam International  Clinic Joint Use Center that aims at international joint  research will be completed by FY96 with the intention of  providing an international base for heavy particle beam therapy.    Design funds for the Center will be appropriated in FY94,  and  construction will begin in 1995. The plans are to encompass 150  researchers at all times by providing a conference room, joint  research labs and individual research labs. Along with this, in  FY94 the NIRS will begin heavy particle project research which  will heighten the therapeutic results of this equipment. Studies  are being conducted to initiate four research groups: a three  dimensional CT development and heavy particle beam therapy  research group; a diagnostic research group; a research group to  physiologically investigate the mechanisms for the treatment of  cancer; and a physics and engineering research group to  physically investigate these mechanisms.</p>

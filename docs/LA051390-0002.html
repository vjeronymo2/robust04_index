			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COVER STORY: THE GREATEST NBA PLAYOFF GAME EVER  </P> <P> With the National Basketball Assn. in the midst of its annual two-month long  tournament to crown a champion, TV Times commenced an informal survey of NBA  announcers to determine the greatest game ever played during an NBA playoff  series. The verdict: Game 6 of the 1985 NBA Finals between the Lakers and  Boston Celtics.  </P> <P> First a bit of history.  </P> <P> Before 1985, the Lakers and the Boston Celtics had met eight times for the NBA  title. The Celtics won each of those championships.  </P> <P> Included in that stretch: a seventh game loss in 1962 (when Frank Selvy missed  a 10-foot shot at the buzzer before Boston won by three in overtime); two point  seventh game losses in 1966 and 1969, and another seventh game loss in 1984.  </P> <P> But it was the following year, when the Lakers and Celtics met again for the  NBA title, that left thousands of Southern Californians delighted and made for  what many consider the most memorable playoff game ever in the National  Basketball Assn.  </P> <P> The Celtics began the series with a 148-114 win in a game dubbed "The Memorial  Day Massacre." But the Lakers responded to win games two, three and five.  </P> <P> That set the stage for the memorable Game Six.  </P> <P> "To me that carried the most drama of any game," said CBS' NBA play-by-play  announcer Dick Stockton, who will again call this year's finals with analyst  Hubie Brown.  </P> <P> "I said to myself, 'If this gets any better, there ought to be an  investigation,"' said Pat O'Brien, who hosts "At the Half" and "The Basketball  Show" for CBS. "I couldn't believe the intensity. I was sitting courtside and  there were goose bumps on my arms because it was so thrilling."  </P> <P> It was a Sunday, June 9. It was hot in Boston -- the Lakers were so concerned  about the heat at the Boston Garden that they took oxygen into their locker  room.  </P> <P> More foreboding than the conditions was the knowledge that the Celtics had  never lost a deciding game in the championship series on their home court.  </P> <P> The Lakers' chief nemesis turned out to be Celtics forward Kevin McHale, who  finished with 32 points before fouling out with 5:21 left.  </P> <P> "McHale was great, and we never found an answer to him, but he didn't beat us,"  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar said after the game.  </P> <P> McHale had 13 points in the first quarter, but the Lakers led 28-26. At  halftime, the game was tied, 55-55, and McHale's total had grown to 21.  </P> <P> The Lakers began the second half making their first five shots, four by the  38-year-old Abdul-Jabbar, and took the lead, 65-61. After Larry Bird sank a  jumper to bring the Celtics to 65-63, the Lakers quickly moved to a 73-63 lead.  </P> <P> Abdul-Jabbar (the series' most valuable player who had a team-high 29 points  that afternoon) scored on a drive; James Worthy dunked off an assist by Magic  Johnson. Then Byron Scott, a non-factor for the first five games, made his  presence felt.  </P> <P> Scott dropped a jump shot from the baseline, then stole the ball from McHale, a  play that led to Kurt Rambis tipping in a missed shot, giving the Lakers their  10-point margin.  </P> <P> "From that point on, it was ours," coach Pat Riley said after the game.  </P> <P> Boston did have one spurt left, coming as close as 86-82 with 8:56 left. But  two free throws each by Abdul-Jabbar and Worthy and a Rambis lay-up rebuilt the  lead to 92-82.  </P> <P> "That's what broke their backs," Rambis said, as the closest the Celtics would  come for the rest of the game was five points.  </P> <P> As Michael Cooper dribbled out the clock for the final seconds of the 111-100  win, listeners to the Lakers radio broadcast heard Chick Hearn proclaim, "At  last, the suffering is over!"  </P> <P> O'Brien had the difficult assignment of going into the Celtics' locker room.  </P> <P> "They were not too pleased," O'Brien recalled. "There was a hush over Boston  Garden. The ghosts of the Garden were scared off by that one."  </P> <P> Following the broadcast, O'Brien went into the Lakers locker room.  </P> <P> "Magic was sitting by himself in the trainer's room saying, 'I did it, I did  it,' " O'Brien said. "They were so happy to get it done."  </P> <P> A season later, the Lakers were upset by the Houston Rockets in the Western  Conference finals, and the Celtics won another title. But in 1987, the Lakers  again beat Boston in the finals at the Forum.  </P> <P> In 1988, the Lakers became the first team since the 1968-69 Celtics to win  consecutive titles, and with their five titles of the decade, earned the  billing as the team of the '80s.  </P> <P> But to at least two who were there, that Sunday afternoon in Boston was  special.  </P> <P> "That game really started them on their way," Stockton said. "Who knows what  would have happened if Lakers hadn't won that one?"  </P> <P> "That's always the best," Johnson said recently. "A tremendous feeling that  you'll never forget."  </P></p>

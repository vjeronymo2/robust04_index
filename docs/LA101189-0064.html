			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROCKET HITS BUS STATION IN KABUL; 23 REPORTED KILLED  </P> <P> A rocket hit a crowded bus station in the Afghan capital of Kabul on Tuesday,  killing 23 people and injuring an undetermined number, Radio Kabul reported.  </P> <P> The official radio, monitored in Islamabad, described a grisly scene of blood,  fragmented bodies and people crying.  </P> <P> It said five surface-to-surface rockets in all hit Kabul on Tuesday, the eve of  the Afghan celebration of the birth of the Muslim prophet Mohammed.  </P> <P> "People, including children, women and old men, were returning home from work  or shopping" when the rocket exploded, the radio said.  </P> <P> It said the rocket was fired "most probably" by mercenaries helping Muslim  guerrillas fighting to topple the Soviet-backed, Communist Afghan government.  </P> <P> Also on Tuesday, Western diplomatic sources in Islamabad said an estimated 2  million people in Kabul face a winter of scarce food and fuel unless the  Communist government changes its priority of supplies.  </P> <P> The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said most of a massive  Soviet airlift to the city consists of weapons instead of food. Western  diplomats reported a similar situation in autumn, 1988, followed by a severe  food shortage.  </P></p>

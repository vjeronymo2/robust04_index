			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Observer: Piccolo Pekkulo An Italian residing in Brussels is today savouring a magnum of Dom Perignon, thanks in part to the FT. It's his prize for winning a bet that he could succeed in having published another in a series of multilingual hoaxes against newspapers, including this one. His score in the FT this week purported to stem from one Manko Pekkulo, of Finland's Brussels embassy. The putative author explained that 'Finlandisation' - being under Moscow's thumb - was not so bad, but added that it was probably inevitable that Finland would now be annexed by another empire, the European Union. The Finnish mission quickly disavowed the letter; the FT published its disclaimer. But 'Manko Pekkulo', using a variety of pseudonyms, claims to have long plied the letters column of the Belgian daily, Le Soir, with spoof letters, including a joke at Japanese Emperor Akihito's expense during his visit to Brussels last September. Yesterday's Italian daily L'Indipendente said that 'the Financial Times had fallen to the pen of Zorro . . .Even the great can err'.</p>

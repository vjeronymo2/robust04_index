L. 102&hyph;240). The objective of the private sector involvement program is to encourage State highway agencies (SHA's), when using Federal-aid highway funds under the grant-in-aid process, to increase their use of contracts with private sector consulting firms for engineering and design-related services when it would be cost-effective to do so. Upon appropriation of funds to be allocated and solicitation of applications, each SHA may submit a request for funding under the new private sector involvement program together with required documentation, as specified in this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  January 17, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Donald J.

Subpart B describes the procedures and criteria that the FHWA would use to evaluate applications from States for the purposes of selecting States to receive funds under the private sector involvement program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Part 172 describes the acceptable procurement methods contracting agencies are permitted to use when acquiring engineering and design services using Federal-aid highway funds. Subpart A retains the existing procurement methods with a technical correction and an addition to the Definition section. Subpart B has been added to establish the private sector involvement program and the procedures to be used to implement the provisions of section 1060 of the ISTEA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1060 authorizes $5 million per year for this program to fund engineering and design services contracts for program management, construction management, feasibility studies, preliminary engineering, design engineering, surveying, mapping, or architectural related services as described in 23 U.S.C. 112(b). The authorized funds are to be appropriated for this program through fiscal year 1997. Funds for the program were not appropriated by the Congress for fiscal years 1992 through 1995. Funds appropriated are to remain available for use until expended. The FHWA will allocate these funds annually, after the funds are appropriated, to at least three States which the FHWA determines have implemented the most effective programs for increasing the percentage of funds they have expended for contracting with private sector consulting firms for engineering and design services to carry out Federal-aid highway projects. These private consulting firms include small business firms and small business firms owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals as defined in 49 CFR part 23.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The program established in subpart B of part 172 sets forth the procedures and criteria used in soliciting applications from States and in evaluating the States' engineering and design programs for purposes of allocating funds under the private sector involvement program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Funds received by a State under this program shall be used only for awarding contracts for engineering and design services in accordance with the provisions of subpart A of 23 CFR part 172 and on projects and activities for which Federal-aid highway funds may be obligated under title 23, United States Code.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These amendments will implement the new private sector involvement program while retaining all the needed requirements of 23 U.S.C. 112(b). This rule describes the various steps the FHWA will use to evaluate, select, and annually allocate funds to not less than three SHA's under the private sector involvement program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> General Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FHWA received comments from fifteen State highway agencies, six professional organizations, and seven private sector firms. General comments were provided by five State highway agencies, six professional organizations, and seven private sector firms in support of the private sector involvement program as proposed in the NPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The five State highway agencies supported the additional funds to be provided under the program. Each indicated that the additional $5 million per fiscal year to be allocated to at least three States would be an incentive for a State to consider applying for an allocation. Also, these States noted that contracting for engineering and design services was in transition and use of consultants was expanding to handle workload peaks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Five of the SHA's, three professional organizations, and four private sector firms offered comments and suggestions regarding the consideration of cost effectiveness in contracting for engineering and design services and in the selection of States to receive allocations under the private sector involvement program. One State asked that cost effectiveness be defined, two other States asked for an indication of the meaning of cost effectiveness, and two other States suggested that the cost effectiveness of States' use of private sector firms be considered in selecting States to receive allocations under the program. Other commenters offered observations, opinions, and information generally supporting the use of private sector firms for engineering and design services as productive and effective means to provide service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Numerous factors are considered in a State's decision to use consultants for engineering and design services and all relate to cost effectiveness considerations. Factors such as quality of work, timeliness, nature of engineering services needed, complexity of the undertaking, available expertise and resources, and current and long term program requirements are all relative cost considerations which may apply in deciding whether States choose to contract for engineering and design services with private sector firms. Use of these factors in decisionmaking varies from State to State. The intent of Congress in authorizing the program was to encourage the use of consultants when the SHA's find it to be cost effective. The Congress did not intend that the FHWA specifically apply cost-effectiveness as a criterion in selecting SHA's to receive an allocation of funds under the private sector program. Therefore, the FHWA has not included cost-effectiveness as a criterion in considering applications and will leave the determination of cost-effectiveness of using consultants in a particular State to the SHA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

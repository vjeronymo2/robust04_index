			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kevin Drew: "Last-Place Slovakia Is Hoping to </F> Gain Ground in Foreign Investment"]    [Text] Bratislava -- If foreign investment is seen as the  engine of growth for the post-communist countries of Central  Europe, Slovakia has sputtered in a wobbly start.    The republic lags far behind the other Visegrad countries  (Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic) and Romania in the  total amount of foreign investment it has attracted since the  revolutions of 1989. And tiny Slovenia, a former member of the  Yugoslav federation, is quickly catching up with Slovakia.    By the end of 1993, 10.8 billion Slovak crowns (Sk), or $366  million, in foreign capital had come into the country. More than  half that -- $220 million -- was made while the republic was  part of Czechoslovakia. After the Czechoslovak split at the  beginning of 1993, foreign investment dropped by 10 percent  compared to the previous year.    All of this is despite the fact that Slovakia offers a  well-trained labor force that is 10 percent cheaper than the  Czech Republic's and 40 percent cheaper than Poland's.    Slovakia's problem is the image of political instability and  stagnating economic reforms that have been created by widespread  bureaucratic inefficiency and accusations of corruption in the  privatization field that arose during the regime of recently  ousted Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar. Government attempts to  woo foreign investors by offering tax incentives and favoring  trade sales over voucher privatization have not solved those  problems.    But a new wave of optimism is filling the offices of  government ministries. Many here hope that a turnaround in  foreign investment can be put on track by year's end, thanks to  a new government, headed by Jozef Moravcik, that has made  economic reform the centerpiece of its policies.    "A lot of people thought our economy would collapse by now,"  said Anna Jostiakova, deputy minister in charge of foreign trade  in the Economics Ministry. "It hasn't, and we think we're about  to bottom out and begin to go forward."    The Moravcik administration's program makes foreign  investment a cornerstone of its economic policies, said Marcela  Sajtlavova, director of economic strategy and policy for the  Economics Ministry. And to increase foreign investment, more  companies must be privatized and released from government hands.    "The new economic program will be difficult to follow, but  it  is our best chance to attract foreign investors," she said.    The new government will get a chance to show off its  programs  in June, when about 20 leading U.S. business executives will  tour the country under the auspices of the Overseas Private  Investment Corp. (OPIC), a semi-official U.S. agency aimed at  spurring investment in developing economies.    Until now, Slovakia's biggest investors have been its  closest  neighbors: Nearly half of all foreign investment comes from  Austrian and German enterprises, and the Czech Republic and  Italy have invested more money than the U.S. into the republic.    The portfolios differ by country, as well. Austrian  investment has for the most part focused on small and  medium-sized enterprises. Most of the American money comes from  the retail giant Kmart.    "The countries closest to us know us the best," said Michael  Mraz, sales executive for the Slovak National Agency for Foreign  Investment and Development. "The further away businessmen are,  the more swayed they are by the country's image."    Mraz said foreign investors are beginning to consider doing  business in Slovakia again. "The quantity and quality of  foreign inquiries has been improving the past four months," Mraz  said. "Investors are looking at long-term projects that will  mean jobs for Slovaks." But Mraz added that despite the  government's commitment to more foreign business, his office is  painfully understaffed, causing a backlog of foreign inquiries.  "We can't sit here in Bratislava and write letters and hope  investors will come. If we are to attract the world, we will  have to go to it."</p>

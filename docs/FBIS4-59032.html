			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentary Group] </F>   [Text] Dr. Velayati, our foreign minister, and his  accompanying high-level diplomatic delegation, who are on a  visit to Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, were accorded a warm  welcome yesterday by the Bosnians. These people had gathered  around the president's house hours before the arrival of the  Iranian delegation, expressed their appreciation for Iran's  selfless compassion and the unstinting assistance of our people.    During the visit by 'Ali Akbar Velayati to  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the first Iranian ambassador was introduced  in Sarajevo, and brief talks were held between the officials of  the two countries. In his meeting with Dr. Velayati, President  Alija Izetbegovic said: Had it not been for the support of the  Islamic Republic of Iran, the struggles of the Bosnian Muslims  would certainly have had a different fate.    In this meeting, Dr. Velayati described the resistance of  the  people of Bosnia-Herzegovina as inspiring pride. He added: The  Islamic Republic of Iran is on the side of the Bosnian Muslims  with all its might. It may be mentioned that the visit of the  Iranian delegation lasted 10 hours in all and at present, Dr.  Velayati is in Zagreb, the Croatian capital.    In his first round of talks with the Croatian prime  minister,  Velayati stressed the common stances of Tehran and Zagreb as  regards the need for greater seriousness on the part of the  United Nations for resolving the crisis in the Balkan region and  he criticized the procrastination and inattention of the  Security Council. Dr. Velayati described the UN's  procrastination and failure to implement the Security Council's  resolutions on Bosnia-Herzegovina as unprecedented in the  history of the organization.    Dr. Velayati also participated in a press conference along  with the Croatian prime minister. The latter hailed Iran's  support for a federation between the Bosnian Croats and Muslims  and expressed his appreciation for Iran's efforts to resolve the  Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. In this press conference, Dr.  Velayati referred to the Croatian prime minister's visit to  Tehran last week and deemed the tripartite session of  Tehran-Zagreb-Sarajevo, useful and effective for the  establishment of peace and security in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    It may be mentioned that last week, on the invitation of  Iran, two high-level delegations from Bosnia-Herzegovina and  Croatia had visited Tehran and important talks had taken place  to resolve the crisis in the Balkan peninsula. The current  visit by the Iranian diplomatic delegation to this area is in  fact considered a continuation of the talks in Tehran.</p>

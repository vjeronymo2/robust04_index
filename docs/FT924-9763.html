			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / The Maastricht Vote: Business organisations demand end to uncertainty BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE: want Yes vote to help end the damaging decline in business confidence. Richard Brown, British Chambers director of policy, said: 'Uncertainty has proved unsettling to the extent that even exporters have not taken advantage of the devaluation of sterling and confidence levels are at their nadir. The vote must be a step towards ending that uncertainty. 'A two-speed Europe has only two gears: forward and reverse. Ratification of the treaty will, on balance, be supremely beneficial'. Failure to ratify, Mr Brown said, will leave Europe without a clear long-term strategy for economic and political stability. ENGINEERING EMPLOYERS' FEDERATION: is looking for 'a clear Yes' tonight, underpinning a firm commitment to Europe. Mr Neil Johnson, federation director-general, said the UK - which last year sent 63 per cent of its engineering exports to the rest of Europe - 'simply cannot afford to send the wrong signals to our European partners. 'Maastricht may have its shortcomings but they pale into insignificance compared with the problems we could face if we reject it. Being temporarily outside the ERM is one thing; being permanently outside the mainstream of the Community is altogether something more serious.' The UK should develop Maastricht, not reject it. BUILDING EMPLOYERS CONFEDERATION: believes a vote rejecting the government motion would inflict incalculable harm on Britain and provoke a political crisis further damaging confidence, according to Sir Brian Hill, its president. Sir Brian said a No vote would mean Britain was 'putting its head in the sand' when it needed to play an active part in the development of Europe. 'It is vitally important for industry that urgent decisions are taken which will set the British economy on course for growth,' he said. With construction facing its worst recession since the 1930s, further political upheaval must be avoided, he added. INSTITUTE OF DIRECTORS: today's vote is a constitutional oddity and an unnecessary distraction from detailed debate on Maastricht. The IoD queries the government's urgency to ratify, given the recent disarray in the exchange rate mechanism, which is central to the Maastricht programme. It views the debate more as a battle for survival by Mr John Major, and it believes he has stuck his head above the parapet unnecessarily. Mrs Ann Robinson, head of the IoD policy unit, says: 'We do not need this debate. It has had its second reading and should proceed to the committee stage, where all its imperfections and ambiguities can be properly examined.' SOCIETY OF MOTOR MANUFACTURERS AND TRADERS: warned Tory MPs that the re-emergence of the UK as a successful car manufacturing nation would be seriously at risk if the government was defeated tonight. The optimistic medium-term outlook for UK car producers, according to Sir Hal Miller, chief executive of the SMMT, 'would be undone should we be faced with a two-speed Europe or the break-up of the single market'. Urging Tory MPs 'not to put Britain into Europe's slow lane', the SMMT warned that EC competitors would seek 'any excuses to prevent UK car exports by Japanese car manufacturers operating in Britain'. CONFEDERATION OF BRITISH INDUSTRY: director-general Mr Howard Davies said ratification of Maastricht was vital to Britain's national interests and for a revival of economic confidence. Failure to back the treaty would leave Britain's EC partners to resurrect it or to construct something like it. 'The government will need to make some difficult decisions in the coming months if we are to right the balance in our economy and secure recovery,' Mr Davies said. 'Without the authority it will gain from completing the ratification process, it will be unable to make those tough decisions stick, with damaging consequences for the nation as a whole'.</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Italy party accused over tax ITALY'S Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) has been embarrassed by revelations that it failed to declare some L400m (Dollars 260,000) to the tax authorities on a property deal. The discovery led to the imprisonment over the week-end of Mr Marco Fredda, in charge of property at the PDS, and Mr Primo Greganti, a former official of the party when it was the Italian Communist Party (PCI). This is the first time the PDS is accused of being involved in illicit party financing. PDS officials have insisted no illegal party financing is at stake like that of the other main parties. However, the admission the party had knowingly kept funds which should have been declared to the tax authorities has shown the PDS as anxious as the rest to maximise its revenues.</p>

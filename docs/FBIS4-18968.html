			<p>BFN     [Text] Replying to questions about the U.S. raid in  Gorazde, government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said the facts  are not yet clear. The spokesman also stressed that we must  seek a just, quick, and viable solution of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina problem based on respect for international  law and the decisions of international organizations.    Replying to another question, Venizelos said Greece was not  informed of the raid beforehand and added that not every NATO  country is informed before similar acts. There is no provision  for any similar process involving deliberations, he said, adding  that the order was given by Akasi, meaning it was actually an  order by the UN secretary general.</p>

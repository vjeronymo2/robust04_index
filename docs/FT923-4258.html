			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Letter: Efficacy of EC proposals to open up banana markets challenged Sir, The letter from Oxfam and Christian Aid (September 1) and your articles on the subject of the proposed EC banana regime (Commodities and Agriculture: August 28 and 20), raise important issues. However, they fail to address the key point of how to protect and transform the economies of uneconomic banana producing countries, without sacrificing the interests of the consumer. As the member of the Fruit Importers Association deputed to represent its views on this subject, I would point out that the question is not whether the EC should sacrifice the African, Caribbean and Pacific, and Community producing countries for Latin American bananas. We accept the need to honour legal and moral commitments to historic suppliers, but strongly challenge the efficacy of the current proposal in being able to deliver its other stated objective of gradually opening the market to free trade for the benefit of consumers. The current Commission proposal appears to seek a 10-year transition to free trade, but wrongly proposes that arrangements based on quota with some tariff support will provide the best opportunity for success. Transitional arrangements dependent on quota have never been successful in other produce areas. Import licence, which marches hand in hand with quota, enables holders to maximise profit at the expense of consumers, producers and disadvantaged competitors. UK banana experience demonstrates the undesirable results of quota-constrained imports organised through a very small number of advantaged traders. Artificially high profits for the owners of licence distort trade in related products, and a cosy lack of competitive activity penalises consumers while failing to encourage the very transition that is sought. The apparently conflicting objectives of opening up the market to the benefit of consumers, while defending the economies of traditional suppliers, can best be achieved by a transition based on tariffication with income support and structural change being funded by the tariffs. This would have the added benefit of being acceptable to the principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. If, finally, it is still proposed to introduce a quota-based system, it is vital that consumers are not disadvantaged by quota volumes that fail to recognise current consumption and consumption trends. It would also be of considerable benefit to consumers and the trade if the necessary import licensing arrangements did not extend the current UK oligopoly, caused by a 'Catch 22' licensing system that effectively prevents distributors from importing bananas, unless they have a track record of importing bananas.

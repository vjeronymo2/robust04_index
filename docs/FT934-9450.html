			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Austria (1): New voters hold the key - The coming year will see a national election, four provincial elections and probably a referendum on EC entry. Not since the 1950s has the country been faced with the prospect of such profound change within such a short period of time AS A rule, things do not happen abruptly in genteel Austria. But people may well look back in a couple of years and be surprised by how much and how quickly the country has changed. By then, Austria could be a member of the European Community and an active participant in pan-European security organisations and United Nations peacekeeping efforts. By then, the cosy political alliance between the Social Democratic party (SPO) and the conservative Austrian People's party (OVP) may have collapsed, as a new generation of voters appears to be abandoning traditional loyalties. The country's leading industries and banks could be fully privatised and freed from the stifling practice of having to assign top jobs on the basis of political suitability. The industrial structure will certainly have changed, as low value-added businesses are forced to migrate east. By then, Vienna, a sleepy and marginal city since the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire in 1918, could again be a vibrant centre of a vigorous central European region. Not since the 1950s, when it managed to see off the four occupying allied powers, has Austria faced the prospect of such profound changes within a short period of time. The country's new coming of age dates symbolically from the retirement of Mr Kurt Waldheim as national president in July, 1992. As long as Mr Waldheim, who concealed his service in a German Wehrmacht unit that was implicated in second world war crimes, was in office, Austria was diplomatically crippled. His successor, Mr Thomas Klestil, a former senior diplomat, has moved rapidly in the past year to re-establish ties with countries that boycotted Austria, and the government has assumed a higher profile generally in international affairs. In June, Vienna hosted the UN human rights conference, and earlier this month it welcomed leaders from 32 countries to a summit meeting of the Council of Europe. Also in June, Mr Franz Vranitzky, the chancellor, became the first Austrian head of government to visit Israel; and he made clear that this was 'an important and significant signal to the world of how we Austrians see ourselves and our history.' In another landmark move, Mr Werner Fasslabend, the defence minister, went to Brussels last month to discuss Austria, hitherto rigidly neutral, taking observer status in the Western European Union. Now the country faces a year of momentous political decisions, with a national election, four provincial elections and probably a national referendum on EC entry in prospect. Both Austrian and EC leaders are publicly committed to completing negotiations on EC entry by early next year. The idea is that an agreement could be approved by the European Parliament before that body dissolves in the spring, and then could be submitted to the Austrian people in a referendum later in the year. The timing of the referendum is a delicate matter. Opposition to the EC is still strong, so if the national election is held before the referendum, EC entry could become a prominent and divisive issue in the election campaign. On the other hand, if the referendum is held first and a majority rejects EC membership, the ruling coalition, which is solidly in favour of membership, would be crippled heading into the election campaign. It is by no means clear that the grand coalition can survive the next election, anyway. Recent elections and polls indicate that the popularity of both the SPO and the OVP continues to fall, while the three smaller parties, the right-wing Freedom party, the Greens and the new Liberal Forum, are gaining ground. 'Anything can happen,' says Mr Erhard Busek, vice-chancellor and leader of the OVP, junior partner in the coalition. The OVP's vote share tumbled from 41 per cent in 1986 to 32 per cent in 1990, and Mr Busek is resigned to further losses next year. But he believes the coalition will survive. 'The combination of the other parties could not make a government, either in numbers or in ideology,' he says. The ever-cautious Mr Vranitzky says only, 'Some Sunday night in October we will see.' Since the last election, the main political issue in Austria has been immigration, as people have become more and more anxious about the flood of immigrants and refugees from eastern Europe. Immigrants and refugees, both legal and illegal, now account for about 9 per cent of the Austrian population, and are concentrated mainly in Vienna and other cities. Mr Jorg Haider, leader of the Freedom party, has won immense popularity by demanding that the government get tougher on immigrants. His party's share of the vote in recent provincial elections has risen to nearly 20 per cent, double its mid-1980s appeal. However, it looks as if the Haider advance has stopped. His petition campaign in January, aimed at forcing the government to outlaw immigration, was soundly defeated. A month later, he was further embarrassed when a few of his more liberal-minded colleagues defected to set up the Liberal Forum. In recent months, the government has taken the remaining wind out of his sails by putting a temporary freeze on immigration, ostensibly because of the slump in the economy. The next indication of the strength of the immigration issue and of Mr Haider's popularity will come in March, when he contests the provincial election in Carinthia, where he used to be governor. In spite of the proximity of all these votes, there is as yet little evidence of a pre-election atmosphere in Austria. Perhaps the rather dull outlook for the economy has put a damper on political sentiment. In its latest forecast on October 1, the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO) said the economy would contract by 0.7 per cent this year and grow by only 1.5 per cent next year. 'It does not appear that the bottom of the economic cycle has been reached,' WIFO reported glumly, pointing to continuing weakness in the vital German market for Austrian exports. Another source of disappointment has been dramatic reverses recently in the nationalised industries. Austria Metall, the aluminium group, looks set alone to lose a numbing Sch13bn by the time its affairs are restored to order next year. The silver lining to these reverses is that the government has at last become committed to selling off its still vast holdings in leading industrial and banking groups, and to creating fair and open capital markets. The Austrian business community has warmly embraced these policy changes. A new generation of ambitious, outward-looking managers is emerging, eager to compete in open markets for both business and investors. Within a couple of years, it will be interesting to see how well they are doing.</p>

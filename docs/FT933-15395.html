			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Mexican inflation at 21-year low MEXICO has achieved its long awaited goal of single-digit inflation, with annual inflation to June falling to 9.8 per cent, from 10 per cent the previous month. This is the first time Mexican inflation has fallen below 10 per cent since 1972. The annual rate was running at 159 per cent as recently as 1987. Inflation for the month of June was 0.5 per cent. The government has made cutting inflation central to economic policy, and greeted yesterday's news with relief. A senior government official said that if it stayed under control there might be room to loosen fiscal policy.</p>

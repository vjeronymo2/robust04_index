			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Brewers droop and spirits are lower, too - Drink / But prospects for the industry over the next year are far from gloomy Given the volume of drinks sent, received and consumed by the City at this time of year, it is no surprise that the beer and spirits indices normally outperform the market in November and December. After all, the upsurge of activity must be benefitting somebody's bottom line, personal or corporate. This year, though, they have not - for only the second time since the 1987 crash. Since November 1, the breweries sector of the FT-SE Actuaries All-Share index is down 1.5 per cent against the market and the spirits sector is down 3.4 per cent. The problem with spirits was clear from the recent results of Guinness, Grand Metropolitan and Allied Domecq, the three largest spirits groups in the world. Slow economic recovery in many of their country markets makes it very hard for them to raise volume and prices. Analysts also had some specific niggles with Grand Met and Allied when results fell short of forecasts, and many downgraded their estimates for this year. The case of the drooping beer index is a little harder to fathom. For the first time since the recession, brewers and pub owners expressed some modest confidence as they announced their results over the past month. Profits matched forecasts and analysts nudged up their estimates. An unexpected excise duty increase in chancellor Kenneth Clarke's mini-Budget soured investor sentiment, but the index's weakness is more relative than absolute. Brewers' earnings will grow this year, but probably at a slower rate than earnings of the overall market. Yet, the sector is still on a prospective market rating and is, relatively, a touch too expensive. All the medium-term trends for brewers and publicans are still at work: beer volume will be down about 1 per cent this year; premium brands and cask ales are growing strongly; people are drinking less in pubs and more at home; trade discounting is deep and widespread; and pubs that push food and amenities are increasing their trade. Some of those factors came through strongly in the results. Good summer weather in parts of the UK stimulated beer sales and many brewers said the upturn continued during the autumn. Premium brands proved particularly strong for Whitbread. Its sales of Heineken Export, Stella Artois, Boddingtons and Murphy's showed percentage growth in the teens for the six months to end-August. The best news on pubs came from Scottish &amp; Newcastle, which has reaped more than expected from its Pounds 703m acquisition last year of the Chef &amp; Brewer chain. But its plans to spend even more on developing its various pub formats, mirrored by many other companies' plans, raises an awkward question for the sector. Is too much money chasing the same development sites and pub themes? 'Its quite frightening that everybody seems to have read the same Henley Centre report on eating out,' says one analyst. If any of the forecasts are slightly wrong, a lot of people will be caught out. Differentiating its own brands of, say, food-serving pubs from those of a rival will be a challenge for any of the brewers. Whitbread is acknowledged as the best at the game, and Bass the one with the most still to do to segment its estate into brands. Picking a beer stock is a matter of taste. Whitbread has the proven record in premium beers and pub branding, but its price reflects that. Scottish &amp; Newcastle offers growth from its pubs and leisure interests. Bass is the biggest gamble, while Greene King is the regional brewer recovering from the lowest base. Similarly, the choice varies among the spirits stocks, although none looks alluring given their modest earnings outlook. But when volumes and prices do begin to rise, perhaps late next year, the effect on profits will be dramatic. One leading analyst estimates that a 1 per cent rise in prices adds Pounds 20m to the pre-tax profits of Guinness, while 1 per cent on volume adds Pounds 13m. Of the three companies, Guinness has the best array of premium brands should drinkers start to move back up market. Moreover, its beer profits exceed those of Bass, Scottish &amp; Newcastle and Whitbread combined. Allied Domecq, hurt by a Mexican downturn in its latest results, will take time to derive benefits from its purchase of Domecq, a leading Spanish and Latin American spirits producer. But, of the three, it is the most narrowly focused on spirits. Grand Met's spirits division, IDV, needs a long list of minor repairs and renovations, judging by the omnibus re-structuring charge the group has just taken. And it is still trying to plug the gap left by losing the Absolut vodka franchise in the US. For any investor spoilt by the choice of drink stocks, perhaps the best approach would be to try the products of each company over the next 10 days  -in moderation, of course.</p>

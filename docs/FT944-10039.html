			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Tomorrows Leisure restructures to cut debt Tomorrows Leisure, the USM-quoted leisure group which has been struggling to extricate itself from a Pounds 16m debt mountain, yesterday announced a financial and management restructuring intended to transform its prospects. The cornerstones of the new package are a Pounds 8.9m placing and rights issue, the conversion of Pounds 4m debt to equity and a link-up with Wiggins, the property developer, which, with parties acting in concert, is to take a 29.42 per cent stake. It is also proposed to subdivide the 20p shares into one 5p ordinary and three 5p deferred. Three Wiggins directors, including Mr Oliver Iny, the chief executive, will take stakes and become non-executive directors. Mr David Edwards, managing director of Scottish &amp; Newcastle's inns division, will become managing director. Mr John Sanderson, Leisure's founder and current chairman, will step aside from day to day management, becoming life president and executive director responsible for asset development. His stake will drop from 36.8 to 5.9 per cent. Under the partnership proposal Wiggins will develop Leisure's 1,000 acres of surplus land through an profit-sharing venture while Leisure will have the opportunity to operate leisure facilities within Wiggins' property developments. Leisure is also acquiring a site in Lincoln with planning permission for leisure facilities from Wiggins for Pounds 2.1m. Wiggins believes Leisure, where interest charges at present exceed operating profit, is undervalued due to uncertainty over its future. The new board's intention is to keep gearing at conservative levels. Mr Peter Dawson, a non-executive director, will become non-executive chairman. He said: 'It's not an exaggeration to say it's a new dawn.' Barclays Bank, currently owed Pounds 15.2m, has agreed to write off Pounds 2m and convert Pounds 4m into a revolving term loan and Pounds 3.5m into shares. A further Pounds 5.7m will be repaid from the placing and rights proceeds. Some 75m shares are being placed with a right issue of a further 24.1m share on a 2-for-1 basis both at 10p. The balance of the proceeds will be used for working capital and acquisitions. For the year to March 31 Leisure reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 538,000 (Pounds 5.79m) on turnover of Pounds 9.32m (Pounds 9.73m), including Pounds 1.13m (Pounds 1.45m) from discontinued activities. Losses per share were 1.8p (45.5p).</p>

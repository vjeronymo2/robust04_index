			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold back above Dollars 360 an ounce THE GOLD price climbed above Dollars 360 a troy ounce yesterday for the first time since it plunged on selling by US computer-controlled funds on September 7. Dollar weakness encouraged early commission house buying as the price was driven to Dollars 361.50 an ounce at one point. But with expected upside resistance looming at Dollars 362 the rise ran out of steam and the price retreated to Dollars 360.25 an ounce, up Dollars 3 on balance, at the London bullion market close. Silver, which led the precious metals rally last week with a 26-cent net rise, put on another 2 cents to close at 434.5 cents an ounce, just below last Thursday's high. In New York early commission house buying lifted Commodity Exchange (Comex) silver prices to the highest levels in a month and a subsequent back-off was slowed by some emerging investment fund buying, dealers told the Reuter news agency. The platinum market, which took part only half-heartedly in last week's rally, was again the laggard, with its price closing in London at Dollars 363.40 an ounce, up Dollars 1.65 on the day.</p>

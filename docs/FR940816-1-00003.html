The proposed amendment parallels recent changes by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to that agency's regulations on insider loans. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Written comments must be received on or before October 17, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  All comments should be addressed to Robert E.

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act (the FRA) (12 U.S.C. 375a) prohibits member banks from making extensions of credit to their executive officers except to the extent authorized by that section. Section 22(h) of the FRA (12 U.S.C. 375b) prohibits member banks from making extensions of credit to their executive officers, directors, principal shareholders, or to a related interest (any company or political or campaign committee that is controlled by an executive officer, director, or principal shareholder), except to the extent authorized by that section. Section 18(j)(2) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the FDI Act) (12 U.S.C. 1828(j)(2)) provides that both sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the FRA are applicable to insured nonmember banks in the same manner and to the same extent as though they were member banks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FDIC regulation which implements sections 22(g) and 22(h) for insured nonmember banks is 12 CFR 337.3. Section 337.3(a) currently provides that insured nonmember banks are subject to the restrictions contained in Subpart A of 12 CFR Part 215, Regulation O (Regulation O), the regulations promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the FRS) to implement sections 22(g) and 22(h) for member banks, to the same extent and to the same manner as though they were member banks, with the exception of &sect;&sect;215.5(b), 215.5(c)(3) and 215.11.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 22(g)(2) of the FRA provides that a loan secured by a first lien on a residence of an executive officer may be made in any amount. Section 22(g)(3) of the FRA provides that loans to finance the educations of executive officers' children may be made in any amount. These requirements are implemented respectively by 12 CFR 215.5(c) (1) and (2). Such loans do, however, count toward the general individual and aggregate lending limits applicable to executive officers, directors,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principal shareholders, and their related interests under 12 CFR 215.4 of Regulation O. See 12 CFR 215.5(d)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

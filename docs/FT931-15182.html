			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Technology: Wooing the customers with automation - Self-service banks are taking on more responsibilities in a bid to cut costs Under fire for their attitude towards customers and desperate to cut costs, banks are turning increasingly to automation as a solution to their problems. Not only are branches expensive to run, but many customers do not like using them. According to a study by Bo Hedberg, a professor at Stockholm University, most customers in Sweden go to banks to get cash, pay bills or deposit money. Only 17 per cent go to make an inquiry. Thus he asks provocatively: 'If the bank branch did not exist in its present form, would anyone bother to invent it?' Many UK banks are asking themselves the same question and looking at ways of cutting branches and staff without losing customers: TSB Bank will shortly introduce self-service machines allowing customers to pay bills, transfer payments between accounts or find out about loans and mortgages. The machines, in some Tyneside branches, will be linked to Teleservice, its telephone-banking project. Users will be able to pick up a phone and ask for more information. The idea is that even at fully-automated 'remote lobbies' customers will be able to speak to someone. At a few larger branches, customers will even be able to see a video image of the employee they are talking to. TSB will close a few of its 22 Tyneside branches, but increase the hours when services are available. If the Teleservice project is successful, it will be adopted nationally. Charles Mears, TSB's Tyneside area director, says market research showed customers 'no longer wanted to be held captive by branch banking hours and a trip to a branch to complete a simple transaction'. Barclays Bank is also cutting branches and plans to increase its use of self-service machines. For the past year, it has assessed customers' reaction to interactive self-service terminals installed in 12 branches. These NCR machines, which Barclays calls Touchbank, offer instant statements, lists of direct debits and standing orders, bill payment and transfer of money between accounts. In addition, they can provide calculations for loan and mortgage repayments or instant insurance quotations. Andrew Bailey, manager of self-service banking at Barclays, says: 'We were surprised that customers were happy to collect so much account information themselves.' In 1993, the bank will test a revised final prototype of the machine for possible national use. The National Westminster Bank is to shut 35 of its 90 branches in London's West End and move back-office work (such as processing cheques and loans) to two types of regional processing centre. NatWest says the money saved will be spent on redesigning other branches to give them more space for automatic teller machines and for interaction between staff and customers. In addition to using ATMs from NCR, the bank is trying out self-service machines around the country, including bank-statement printers. It also uses some self-service machines for share dealing and mortgage information. Gunnar Enroth, Digital Equipment's market development manager for retail banking, expects more banks to cut branches, centralise back-office processing and use more self-service terminals. Costs per transaction with self-service machines are only a quarter of the cost of using staff, he says. And machines could easily carry out the most common banking transactions. Customers also want better access to services, as the success of the Midland Bank's 24-hour telephone banking service, First Direct, has shown. Paul McDermott, systems marketing manager at NCR, says: 'Customers want service when they want it, and they usually want it immediately.' This helps explain why banks increasingly take their services to the customer through ATMs in company offices, petrol stations, supermarkets, department stores and shopping centres. Some 200 Barclays cash machines - 10 per cent of the total - are located away from banks; Lloyds has 300 non-bank cash machines. But machines have limitations. Cost savings vary according to how heavily they are used. Jerry Whitmarsh, head of technology planning for NatWest's branch network, says: 'One problem in providing a lot of services on the same self-service machine is that it slows down the throughput of customers. But apart from cash, it isn't usually practical to dedicate a machine to a single product.' However, a growing number of dedicated machines are becoming available. Enroth says some ATMs which dispense cash in less than 15 seconds have been installed in Russia, Germany and France. Customers are also reluctant to use machines for some services like depositing money. However, a new ATM from IBM being tested by some US banks can display an image of cheques fed into it. This may help reassure customers that the money really will end up in their accounts.</p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Warburg buys more BT shares SG WARBURG, global co-ordinator of the British Telecom public offer, has paid Pounds 384m to buy an additional 91.5m shares from the government to meet international demand. The purchase, at the offer price of 420p, puts the number of shares taken by foreign investors up to 579.5m, against 732m sold in the UK public offer. The total number of British Telecom shares sold by the government now comes to 1.31bn. Warburgs said that although the purchase marked the end of the 30 day stabilisation period, at no stage had there been a need to support the share price.</p>

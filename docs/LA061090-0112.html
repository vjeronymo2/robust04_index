			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE LAST TO GO BY RAND RICHARD COOPER (AVON: $7.95)  </P> <P> Rand Cooper uses a series of overlapping vignettes to present a sort of Cubist  portrait of a disintegrating upper-middle class marriage. Dan and Mary Ellen  Slattery seemed like an ideal couple: Their divorce shocked everyone who knew  them.  </P> <P> Cooper scrapes off their sleek veneer and examines the gradual erosion of love  that transformed devoted partners into strangers and, ultimately, enemies. The  story is divided among several narrators, but these characters sound too much  alike for the switches to be very effective. Toby, the Slattery's son, who  watches his parents separate (and never forgives his father for leaving), is  the most credible observer; the version of the separation recounted by a  heretofore unmentioned neighbor near the end of the book reads like an early  draft of a different story.  </P></p>

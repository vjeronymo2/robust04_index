			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> National Football League players have no right to sue the league under  antitrust laws because the labor laws that govern collective bargaining  supersede them, a league attorney told a federal appeals panel in St. Paul,  Minn.  </P> <P> If a three-judge panel of the U.S. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals sides with the  owners, the players' union could not proceed with its claim that the NFL's  free-agency system restricts competition and suppresses wages.  </P> <P> But if the panel decides not to rule on the league's request, or rules in favor  of the players, the union could proceed with a trial, scheduled for November  before U.S. District Judge David Doty in Minneapolis, said Paul Tagliabue, an  NFL lawyer.  </P> <P> The appeals panel took the case under advisement and did not say when it would  rule.  </P></p>

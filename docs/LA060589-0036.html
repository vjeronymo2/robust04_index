			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES: PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS OVERPLAYS ITS STRENGTH  </P> <P> The Pursuit of Happiness is no revolutionary rock band, but it is one worth  rallying around for listeners who think that a catchy melody and a hammering  beat is a pop fan's inalienable right. The strength of the Canadian band's show  on Saturday at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano was its ability to send  time and again a capsule of captivating melody into orbit on the shoulders of a  booster-rocket instrumental surge.  </P> <P> But by overplaying its strength, TPOH turned it into a flaw. Like space  launches, those catchy pop blast-offs became a little routine with successful  repetition, no matter how magnificent they might be individually. It would have  helped if the band, which plays again Tuesday at Bogart's, had slowed the pace  from time to time during the 80-minute set, instead of making nearly everything  hurtle ahead at full thrust.  </P> <P> If The Pursuit of Happiness can be criticized for following a formula, it's  only fair to appreciate how much fun that formula is, with bright,  Bangles-quality female backing vocals cushioning the propulsive attack and  propping up Moe Berg's Everyman lead voice. Berg's songs about "Love Junk" --  the title of TPOH's debut album -- address matters of the heart and loins from  shifting perspectives that ranged from crude to offbeat to winsomely innocent.  The five new songs confirmed old strengths rather than pointing toward new  directions. MIKE BOEHM  </P></p>

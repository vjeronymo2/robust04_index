			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Singapore (12): Widening the island's mental horizons - Profile: Role of the SIF ONE thing Singapore cannot be faulted for is planning. Long before the government announced its policy to develop a fully fledged external economy and encourage Singaporeans to invest overseas, the ground was being prepared. The Singapore International Foundation (SIF) was founded in 1991 with the specific goal of encouraging Singaporeans to think internationally. Dr Chan Heng Chee, former university lecturer and most recently Singapore ambassador to the UN, is SIF's director. Though government played a role in bringing the SIF into being, Dr Chan stresses that the SIF is an independent, non political organisation. 'We aim to help Singapore in its efforts to go global. This should benefit others and benefit Singapore as well. 'We have organised voluntary service schemes and now have Singaporean professionals helping in various countries. At the same time we try to stay in contact with Singaporeans overseas, to tell them about developments here.' Dr Chan feels much has changed in Singapore - not just the physical landscape. 'Singapore has opened up. If you read the newspapers today compared with a few years ago they are very different. There is more willingness to criticise. 'The arts and theatre scene has changed. It might have a certain innocence and perhaps it lacks sophistication. But I tell people there are tremendous opportunities in Singapore, especially for the young.' The SIF estimates that up to 100,000 Singaporeans are now living abroad, a sizeable proportion of Singapore's 2.8m population. Dr Chan says that there is concern about a brain drain and one of the aims of the SIF is to keep in touch with Singapore's overseas talent. She denies any suggestion that her organisation is out to keep tabs on its citizens. 'I don't have lists of names or dossiers - there is no Big Brother motive.' Dr Chan feels Singapore has a lot to offer the world. 'Singapore is a good brand name. We work hard, we are efficient, we get jobs.' The SIF seeks to help Singaporeans to internationalise, while maintaining what's considered to be a distinct Singaporean identity. According to Dr Chan that identity is made up of various elements. Insecurity is one of them. 'Insecurity is part of the psyche of Singapore. Our history has taught us that we are vulnerable. We are a paradox. We always have to balance the needs of creativity with the requirements of building a state, a nation.' But as more and more Singaporeans seek opportunities overseas, they will have to loosen up. 'That will be a challenge to our identity.'</p>

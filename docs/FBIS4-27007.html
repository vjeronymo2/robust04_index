			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 28 KYODO -- The Chinese Government has  approved basic criteria for industrial projects eligible for  fixed assets investment, a move aimed at further controlling  credit in China's booming economy, a state newspaper reported  Tuesday [28 June].    According to the new regulations titled "the economic  standards and scale of fixed assets investment projects," banks  must now give loans and funding priorities to the industries  listed by the State Council, the CHINA SECURITIES DAILY reported.    Such industries, after further approval of the State  Council,  or China's cabinet, will also be eligible to raise funds by  issuing stocks and bonds, the paper said.    The first group of industries which will enjoy investment  approval and priority include those involved in the production  of refined oil, electrolytic copper and aluminum, polyamide and  polyester fiber, ethylene and polyethylene fiber, video  recorders, engines and motor vehicles, it said.    The industries listed by the State Council will be subject  to  change, the paper said, while it refrained from detailing what  recourse healthy companies in other sectors of the economy can  take to assure credit or investment funds.    The Chinese Government has largely blamed an overheated  economy marked by high inflation, massive speculation, huge  losses and giant profit taking on high fixed assets investment,  which grew by an average of 75 percent between 1990-92 and 47  percent last year.</p>

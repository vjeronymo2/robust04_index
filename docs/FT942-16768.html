			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Channel 5 must bow to technology Sir, As the association of UK consumer electronic manufacturers, we would normally support additional programme services. However, we are against the proposal to go ahead with a Channel 5 licence using existing technology. First, the frequencies proposed for Channel 5 have been used for 15 years for interconnecting signals from domestic video recorders to television receivers. Interference problems if a Channel 5 service commences will be enormous, involving the retuning of video recorders and TV equipment in 3m to 5m homes; moreover, there will be a huge problem of cost (perhaps Pounds 50 per household), and problems of access to domestic installations. Second, the development of digital TV broadcasting technology is moving very fast, and offers the prospect within three to five years of providing six to eight TV channels of normal definition in the frequency spectrum used by a single conventional Channel 5. Such digital services would cause much less of an interference problem with conventional domestic installations. Also, with the passage of time, such problems would be lessened by the increasing number of domestic installations employing interconnection of domestic video recorders and TV, using the eurosockets now fitted to virtually all video recorders and table model colour television receivers. In BREMA's view, the case for Channel 5 has now been overtaken by technology.

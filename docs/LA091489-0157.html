			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: FOUNTAIN VALLEY;  </P> <P> SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO;  </P> <P> CREW RAZING GAS STATION SEVERS TELEPHONE CABLE  </P> <P> A backhoe operator demolishing a gas station Wednesday morning accidentally cut  two telephone cables, leaving more than 500 Pacific Bell customers without  service until evening.  </P> <P> The backhoe was being used by a work crew to unearth the station's three large  gasoline storage tanks at Del Obispo Street and Camino Capistrano, according to  telephone company officials.  </P> <P> "One of the cables got really chewed up," said George Travieso, a member of the  the repair team that worked throughout the day to splice an estimated 1,000  pairs of broken wires that stuck out of the 4-foot-deep hole left by the  backhoe.  </P> <P> Service to customers along Del Obispo, between Camino Capistrano and Ortega  Highway, was restored at about 7 p.m., Pacific Bell spokeswoman Linda Bonniksen  said late Wednesday.  </P> <P> Paul Carnes, another Pacific Bell representative, said the accident occurred  because the contractor for the Southland Corp., which was supervising the  demolition, had failed to notify utilities 48 hours ahead of time of its plan  to unearth the tanks. Carnes said the fine for failing to report digging  operations can be up to $5,000.  </P> <P> Tony Manos, vice president of MacIntosh Construction, said he had neglected to  notify the telephone company and conceded that the phone line was clearly  marked.  </P> <P> "It was just an accident," he said.  </P></p>

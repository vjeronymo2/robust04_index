			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: FILLMORE;  </P> <P> START OF RECYCLING PROGRAM DELAYED  </P> <P> The Fillmore City Council has delayed the inception of the city's first  curbside recycling program.  </P> <P> The council is waiting for the disposal company that proposed the program to  come up with a fee schedule that allows people with small amounts of trash to  pay less than those with large amounts.  </P> <P> The proposal by Santa Clara Valley Disposal Co. is modeled on a recycling  program in the city of Ventura.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, at least 1,000 Fillmore homes would participate in a  simplified recycling program that does not require separation of materials.  </P> <P> A single plastic barrel would be provided to participating households. The  barrels would be used for plastic containers marked "CA Redemption Value,"  glass and aluminum cans. Newspapers could be placed on top of the mixed  material.  </P> <P> City Manager Roy Payne said the program was delayed pending the opening of a  center where recyclable materials can be stored for marketing.  </P> <P> "Recycling easily becomes a habit," Payne said. "I think we'll see good  participation."  </P> <P> The program could start as soon as July 1, Payne said. JANET BERGAMO  </P></p>

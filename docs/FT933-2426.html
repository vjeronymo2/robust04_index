			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Markets: Something nasty in the long grass - London LIKE an autumn gardener stumbling over a rake, the markets this week received a sharp, unpleasant blow from a long forgotten source. The culprit, inflation, had vanished from sight over the summer. Hidden by long grass and the yellowing heaps of analysts' circulars, it had lost its power to frighten. The artificially low 'headline' figures for the retail price index, held down by the cuts in interest rates, showed annual inflation of 1.4 per cent in July. Such exceptionally low numbers flattered the figure for underlying inflation, helping to create the belief that prices were headed remorselessly lower. This expectation was one of the factors behind the summer rally in bond and equity markets. The effect is captured in the chart, which shows the markets' measure of expected inflation (derived by subtracting the yield on index-linked gilts from the yield on their conventional counterparts). This line, in steady decline for most of the past year, is mirrored by the rise in the equity market. In recent days, however, both lines have moved the other way. The reversal of trend was particularly abrupt on Wednesday, when the August inflation numbers appeared, showing a noticeably faster rise in prices than the consensus expectation. Headline inflation had jumped to 1.7 per cent. The official measure of underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage interest payments, had risen from 2.9 per cent to 3.1 per cent, its highest level since March. And on a still more pessimistic measure of the price level - adjusting for the continuing impact of the shift of local taxation - the figure is 3.6 per cent. Because it was so unexpected, this fairly small rise in inflation had an exaggerated impact. The government bond market had its worst day since the pound left the ERM exactly a year before; the yield on 10-year gilts rose from 6.86 per cent to 7.04 per cent. The FT-SE 100 index also suffered, dropping 38.6 points to 2,989.4, its largest one-day fall for seven months. By the end of the week, with the markets unsettled also by the expiry of the Footsie futures contract, equities had recovered somewhat. The FT-SE 100 index ended on Friday 3005.5, a drop of 31.5 points on the week. It was safely back above 3,000, and the scale of the setback was only modest; but the tone of analysts' comments had changed. The most famously bullish of their number, Nomura's Nick Knight, was admitting to a 'more hesitant stance in the short term', which is analyst-ese for 'Excuse me while I back-pedal'. Bearish commentators, such as Panmure Gordon's Robin Aspinall, had cranked the tone-knob further towards gloom: UK equities were 'dangerously exposed,' he said, offering at best a long period of poor performance, 'and the worst does not bear thinking about.' An analysis couched purely in British terms would miss an important part of the week's news, however. London was not the only equity market to suffer a sharp setback on Wednesday: Paris fell 2 1/2 per cent, Frankfurt 1 per cent, Amsterdam 2 per cent. One common influence on all these markets was the outlook for long-term US interest rates, which moved back above six per cent this week after their headlong fall throughout the summer. Although the scale of the US reversal was not great - less significant, to a chartist's eye, than the move in the UK  - it too was influenced by inflation worries and it left investors understandably nervousness. Was the turn in the US interest-rate cycle at hand? Chris Golden, who watches worldwide bond markets for Lehman Brothers in London, thinks the worry is overdone. 'People have a gut feeling: 'My God, these rates are really low,'' he says. But adjusted for inflation, yields are safely above their long-term average of around 2 1/2 -3 per cent. And UK yields are in real terms among the highest. Still, this week's inflation flurry has given investors reason to shift their attention from the relative yields on stocks and bonds - a comparison that helped to propel the equity market to its summer highs. If there is a little more uncertainty than there was over the future direction of long-term interest rates, that serves to heighten the scrutiny given to UK earnings. The flow of results and trading comments this week have not stood up well to such inspection. On Thursday, in particular, there were worrying announcements by two big companies. LIG, the condom-maker, made its second profits warning in seven months; Tony Butterworth, its chief executive, announced that he would be retiring early. Earlier this year, analysts had been expecting annual profits of about Pounds 40m. After this week's news of poor trading in the photo-processing division, they had slashed their forecasts to Pounds 18m, and the shares fell 63p to 140p in response. On the face of it the big corporate result of the day, interim figures from United Biscuits, was more cheerful. Despite recession and fierce price competition, UB had managed to keep pre-tax profits before exceptionals moving ahead, even though the gain was only 1 per cent. Investors were not in a mood to be cheered however: UB shares dropped 37p on the week, closing at 351p. The results highlighted a margin squeeze at the McVitie's biscuits division, one of British industry's most famously well-run businesses. Market share had come under pressure in the first quarter; the division won it back in the next three months but had to sacrifice profitability to do so  -and lower margins were likely to persist for the foreseeable future. This is not the sort of news that a stock market selling at 20 times earnings likes to hear.</p>

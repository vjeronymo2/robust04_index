Two Johannesburg-based newspapers reported  on Friday [25 March] morning the former Vlakplaas operative had  gone into hiding, apparently in Europe.    One newspaper reported he left on a flight from Cape Town on  Tuesday evening to Frankfurt, and then onto another destination  in Europe. The report could not be confirmed.    News of his departure from the country comes amid a report  in  another newspaper that the Goldstone Commission has discovered a  Swiss bank account used to fund third force activities. The  newspaper said information about the fund was one of the cards  Mr Justice Richard Goldstone was holding back as he prepared for  an all out confrontation with Police Commissioner General Johan  van der Merwe.    It said Judge Goldstone was also in possession of a  video-tape incriminating several of the people named in its  latest report.</p>

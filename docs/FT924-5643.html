			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Hopes rise for meeting between Mandela and Buthelezi PROSPECTS for a meeting between South Africa's two rival black leaders, Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom party, brightened yesterday as delegations from both sides attempt to set up top-level talks. Officials of the two sides said senior delegations from the ANC and Inkatha would meet 'as soon as possible' to finalise arrangements for a bilateral meeting between the two leaders. But officials of the National Peace Committee, which worked towards a meeting for weeks said it could still collapse. Asked whether the ANC had dropped pre-conditions it earlier set for meeting Chief Buthelezi - including agreement on fencing migrant workers' hostels and banning so-called traditional weapons such as clubs and spears, conditions rejected by Inkatha - the chairman of the National Peace Committee, Mr John Hall, said the preparatory teams would have to work this out. Mr Hall and other intermediaries, including western diplomats, have for months tried to persuade Mr Mandela and Chief Buthelezi to meet to address the problem of worsening township violence which has left 3,000 people dead this year alone. Mr Hall said he believed prospects for a meeting were better now than at any time in the recent past. The two men last met bilaterally nearly two years ago, but failed to reduce the level of violence between their supporters. Mr Hall said a meeting of all signatories to the National Peace Accord, including main political groups in South Africa, would also be held soon, adding this could pave the way for the resumption of multi-party talks on a new constitution. The ANC yesterday confirmed its more moderate position in those talks when its national executive committee endorsed power sharing in a government of national unity, even after a post-apartheid constitution is in place.</p>

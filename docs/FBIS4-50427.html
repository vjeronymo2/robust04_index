			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Trade Minister Optimistic on 1994 Exports"] </F>   [Text] Despite higher export costs, the nation's foreign  trade posted a sound performance in the first quarter.    "Exports did not slide as in the corresponding period last  year, and imports did not spin out of control," said Wu Yi,  Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec) .    Exports grew by 18.7 per cent over the first quarter last  year and imports grew by 18.2 per cent, according to Customs  figures.    Wu stressed that China plans to achieve a virtual balance  between its imports and exports by the end of this year, with  total foreign trade standing at around $200 billion.    China suffered a deficit of $12.2 billion last year, partly  because of a booming domestic market that drew resources away  from exports.    Wu said the unification of the two-tier foreign exchange  rate  system presents China with an unprecedented opportunity to  develop exports.    However, higher export costs threaten to offset almost all  the benefits brought by the foreign exchange reform.    Exports prices are being driven up by rising costs,  especially of raw materials, as foreign countries lower their  purchasing prices for imports in the wake of the renminbi's  devaluation. The standardized exchange rate now is 8.7 yuan per  dollar, compared with 5.7 yuan before.    The prices of raw materials have risen in part because of  the  unexpected growth in investment in fixed assets. This has made  it difficult for the central bank, the People's Bank of China,  to keep a cap on capital spending.    Analysts said that the recent move by the State Council to  cancel some of the country's futures trading markets would also  help slow the price spiral.    In particular, the steel futures trading market was stopped  to prevent the price of steel, the most sought-after product in  the investment expansion, from soaring.    Economists maintain that unchecked speculation by futures  traders has unjustifiably forced up the country's overall price  level.    The new Import and Export Bank will also benefit Chinese  exporters of value-added machinery and electronics.    "It seems that China's exports are facing a bundle of  lurking  problems, but they are progressing steadily," said a senior  government economist.    Another major threat to exports is unchecked competition  among domestic exporters, who tend to slash their prices to win  foreign market share but at the expense of national interests.    Wu Yi said China is intensifying its efforts to bring order  to exports.</p>

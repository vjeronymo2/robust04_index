			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Company News: Blockbuster in first payout after 62% advance BLOCKBUSTER Entertain-ment, the fast-growing US video-retailing group, yesterday reported a 62 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings. It also began paying quarterly dividends with a payout of 2 cents, Bloomberg reports. Earnings for the quarter rose to Dollars 25.7m, or 15 cents a share, from Dollars 15.9m, or 10 cents, in the same quarter last year. Revenue rose to Dollars 253.9m from Dollars 176.7m. Mr H. Wayne Huizenga, chairman, said: 'With the company's substantial cash flow, we are in a position to pay our shareholders dividends and to continue to fund the company's aggressive capital requirements.' He attributed the improved results to expanded market growth, gains in same-store revenue, continued emphasis on cost control and increased productivity. Blockbuster became the world's largest home video retailer following its acquisition earlier this year of City-vision, the largest home video operator in the UK. Partly as a result of that acquisition, Philips Electronics invested Dollars 93m in Blockbuster common stock. Philips, a Dutch company, also holds an option to acquire 5m additional shares of Blockbuster stock before December 15. If Philips exercises the entire option, it would hold about 7.1 per cent of the video company's outstanding shares, Blockbuster said. At the end of the quarter, there were 2,829 Blockbuster video stores, of which 1,805 were company owned and 1,024 franchised.</p>

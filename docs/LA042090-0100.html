			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $400-MILLION PROJECT NEAR MARINA APPROVED  </P> <P> Channel Gateway, a $400-million high-rise office, condominium and apartment  project next to Marina del Rey, won unanimous approval Thursday from the Los  Angeles City Planning Commission after neighborhood leaders praised the massive  development.  </P> <P> The 16-acre project, planned by developer Jerome Snyder and associates, will  include 512 condominiums in two 16-story towers, 544 apartments in clusters of  four-story buildings, a 314,000-square-foot office building, and parking for  more than 3,460 cars.  </P> <P> Although the project will dramatically increase density in the already  congested Lincoln Boulevard corridor, Venice community leaders said the largely  residential development is a vast improvement over a shopping center and office  complex once planned for the property.  </P></p>

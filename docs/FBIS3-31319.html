			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jagodina, 17 Feb (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik,  president of the assembly of the Srpska republic, today  expressed optimism with regard to the international community's  standpoint that the question of demilitarization of the Sarajevo  area be resolved by diplomacy rather than by bombardment, as  envisaged under a NATO ultimatum.    I am optimistic -- Krajisnik said in his statement today to  Jagodina Radio -- as I believe that the international community  will realize that the Serbs have accepted everything that is  required of them.    "We have agreed to the proposal that Sarajevo be placed  under  UN administration; we have accepted an agreement on the future  organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina; we have signed with the  Croat side an agreement on the cessation of hostilities until  political solutions are found; we have agreed that our aircraft  should not fly over Bosnia-Herzegovina; and finally, we have  agreed that our weaponry be placed under UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] control."    "All this must be enough for the international community to  realize who is cooperative and which side wants to put an end to  the war as soon as possible. This is why I am positive that the  European Union [EU] and the United Nations will find a  diplomatic solution which will avert NATO's threat to bomb Serb  positions. Otherwise such an act would be the grossest crime in  the 20th century in Europe, as aggression would be committed at  a time when the two warring parties, the Serbs and Muslims, have  signed a cease-fire, and when there are no combat actions in  this area."    Asked whether heavy weaponry would be removed 20 kilometers  from Sarajevo or placed under UNPROFOR control, Krajisnik said:    "NATO demands that we withdraw our heavy artillery by 20  kilometers from Sarajevo is in fact demanding that Serb units be  disarmed. At the same time this means that the Serb side should  abandon its centuries-old ethnic lands and hand over Sarajevo to  the Muslim republic. We do not accept this as this amounts to  capitulation. We are nevertheless willing to allow UNPROFOR  representatives to control our heavy weaponry, which would  guarantee that there would be no combat activities from our  positions," Momcilo Krajisnik told Jagodina Radio.</p>

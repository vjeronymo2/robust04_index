			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KREMLIN WARNS U.S. OF TOUGH WEAPONS TALKS  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who arrived here Tuesday for four days  of negotiations with Soviet leaders on arms control issues, will find the  bargaining tougher than the United States has come to expect from President  Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Kremlin officials warned.  </P> <P> While hopeful that progress can be made on agreements reducing the two  superpowers' strategic arsenals and cutting back conventional forces in Europe,  Soviet officials said that Gorbachev has gone about as far as he can without  significant U.S. concessions.  </P> <P> "The era of the cheap compromise is over," a senior Soviet foreign policy  specialist said, "and we have already done about all we dare do unilaterally.  The next moves will require some difficult decisions for both sides."  </P> <P> While denying that Gorbachev has buckled under pressure from the Soviet  military and conservatives within the Communist Party leadership, Soviet  officials acknowledge a new firmness -- much commented upon in the West -- in  Moscow's approach to arms control negotiations.  </P> <P> "We have spoiled the Americans in arms control, and they now expect endless  unilateral concessions," Leonid Dobrokhotov, a senior party official, commented  in advance of the Baker visit. "But we have reached the bottom line, the line  beyond which unilateral moves cannot be made, the line at which the United  States will have to match us."  </P> <P> The outlook for Baker's talks with Gorbachev and Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the  Soviet foreign minister, is consequently more somber than at previous rounds of  negotiations, and the success of the summit meeting between President Bush and  Gorbachev in Washington starting May 30 is at stake.  </P> <P> While promising "flexibility" and readiness to move on key issues, a senior  U.S. official traveling with Baker said the U.S. side would be "bitterly  disappointed" if these talks did not restore agreements that American  negotiators believed they had won on sea-launched and air-launched cruise  missiles only to find that Moscow had apparently retreated.  </P> <P> "This is a major litmus test by any standard," the U.S. official commented,  asking not to be quoted by name. "It would be very disturbing if they were not  willing to go back to what we had in February."  </P> <P> For both sides, the restrictions to be placed on the sea- and air-launched  cruise missiles -- the number each side may have, how they will be counted,  what range they may have -- are central to the conclusion of a strategic arms  reduction treaty.  </P> <P> There are also serious differences over mobile missiles with multiple warheads  and on heavy, land-based missiles.  </P> <P> Agreement also must be reached on means to verify each side's compliance with  the proposed treaty, which itself is a highly complex and sensitive issue.  </P> <P> Soviet officials in recent days have seemed less apprehensive than their U.S.  counterparts about the possibility of falling well short of even the reduced  goals they have set for the arms talks.  </P> <P> "We will go as far as we can in these talks, and it may not be that far because  we will not go for an agreement for its own sake," a Soviet arms specialist  said. "Then, at the summit, we will seek what agreement we can on the  outstanding issues and perhaps on principles for the next stage. A smaller  agreement is better than a bad agreement."  </P> <P> U.S. officials, expressing hope that some issues can be resolved here this week  and others agreed to in principle at the summit, said that the strategic arms  negotiators for the two countries will resume work in Geneva on Monday and will  continue through the summer.  </P> <P> Also on the agenda for the Baker visit are the negotiations in Vienna between  members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact on  reducing conventional armed forces in Central Europe and future arrangements  for European security after the unification of Germany.  </P> <P> "We cannot simply let Germany slide by -- for us it is key," commented Andrei  Kortunov, a foreign policy specialist at the United States of America and  Canada Institute here. "We know we are not going to war and can assume that a  strategic arms agreement will be worked out. That is an issue left from  yesterday.  </P> <P> "The future of Germany, the shape of the new Europe and its security structure  -- these are the issues of tomorrow. They are also issues we feel much more  now."  </P> <P> In addition, U.S. and Soviet officials will discuss a wide range of other  questions -- human rights, trade, regional conflicts, space cooperation and  international issues, including terrorism and narcotics trafficking -- to  prepare the agenda for the Bush-Gorbachev summit.  </P> <P> The secession efforts by the Soviet Union's three Baltic republics -- Estonia,  Latvia and Lithuania -- will also be discussed, U.S. and Soviet officials said.  </P> <P> Their drive to recover the independence they enjoyed between the two world wars  has added to the domestic crises facing Gorbachev and has become a potential  issue in Soviet-American relations.  </P> <P> "To ensure success in Washington in two weeks, there must be real progress in  the talks with Baker," a Soviet Foreign Ministry official said. "These talks  will have a big, even decisive role."  </P> <P> Who must move first and who must make the greater concessions to achieve  last-minute compromises are naturally contentious issues in themselves, and  each side is maneuvering to place the onus on the other.  </P> <P> "We have serious expectations for a series of agreements on disarmament," a  senior Soviet foreign policy official said in advance of the Baker visit,  requesting that he not be quoted by name, "but the current U.S. proposals do  not take into account our national security. They are fine for the U.S., but  not for us. There is no balance. . . . We thus are placing great hopes on the  talks with Baker."  </P> <P> Although many factors are involved, the Soviet Union's multiple crises --  economic, political and ethnic -- have restricted Gorbachev's ability to  maneuver and put him under mounting pressure to ensure the country's national  security, according to senior Soviet officials.  </P> <P> In the view of many Gorbachev supporters, including senior officials in the  government and party, the Soviet president must balance himself and all he does  very carefully to ensure the success of perestroika, his program of political  and economic restructuring, and his own survival as a political leader.  </P> <P> "For Gorbachev, just as for Bush, any agreement we reach must be ratifiable,"  said Dobrokhotov, the senior party official. "That means it must be clearly in  our national interests, and our security must be enhanced by it. The cost --  what we give up -- moreover, must be balanced and fair, for us as well as to  the United States, and it must be perceived that way. . . ."  </P> <P> The point, made repeatedly by Soviet officials, is that Gorbachev must win  approval not only within the party's ruling Politburo and its Central Committee  but from the Supreme Soviet, the country's legislature, before any arms control  treaty is signed, and an agreement perceived as one-sided will face strong  opposition.  </P> <P> "People in the United States should remember that Gorbachev is not a ruler in  the Stalinist mold, that he has constituencies, that he must deal with  contending forces," Prof. Vitaly I. Goldansky, director of the Soviet Academy  of Sciences' Institute of Physical Chemistry and a Gorbachev adviser on arms  control, said in an interview Tuesday. "He let that genie of democracy out of  the bottle, and he has to take into account the views of others."  </P> <P> Those views now include outspoken, even harsh criticism from the far right and  from some ranking officers of the Soviet military of much of Gorbachev's  foreign policy, including the unilateral troop reductions now under way, the  withdrawal of Soviet troops from Czechoslovakia and Hungary and some of the  terms already agreed upon in the strategic arms reduction talks.  </P> <P> "Gorbachev has had to show increased firmness to deal with our multiple,  compounded crises, and you cannot be tough in one sphere and soft in another,"  one Soviet political commentator remarked.  </P> <P> "And, as much as we want better relations with the United States and arms  control agreements, the future of perestroika and Gorbachev's continued  leadership take precedence because they are the key to everything else."  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> FLA. TRIES TO REMOVE S&amp;L CHIEF  </P> <P> State Comptroller Gerald Lewis today began legal action to remove David L. Paul  as chairman of CenTrust Bank of Miami, claiming Paul has used Florida's largest  savings and loan to support his "opulent life style."  </P> <P> Lewis filed an administrative complaint that seeks removal of Paul as chairman  of the thrift. Paul has 21 days to either contest the complaint through a state  hearing or comply with it.  </P> <P> "Paul maintained an opulent life style largely at the expense of the  association and generally treated a federally insured financial institution and  public company as it if were his own public piggy bank," Lewis said in the  complaint.  </P> <P> The complaint was filed 11 days after federal regulators, also citing  CenTrust's lavish spending practices, ordered the institution to stop  squandering its assets on fine art, sailboats, excessive executive salaries and  other personal expenses.  </P> <P> Terence McElroy, spokesman for the comptroller's office, said the action today  was highly unusual.  </P> <P> "But it's a fairly unusual institution," McElroy said.  </P></p>

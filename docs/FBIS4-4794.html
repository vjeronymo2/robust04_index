			<p>BFN     [Text] The Vietnamese Government is developing a strategy  for the gradual development of the railway service system.  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet said that in 1994 priority should be  given to investment in upgrading and step by step modernizing of  the Vietnam railway.    He said expenditure on rail infrastructure would be above  and  beyond the system's operation aimed at paying for itself. The  railway service would be formulating development goals to be  achieved in the years 2000, 2010, and 2020 respectively.</p>

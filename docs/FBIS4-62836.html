			<p>BFN     [Text] Flight personnel in Khabarovsk did not support the  appeal of the strike committee to start a strike on May 18.    Chief of the Far East Civil Aviation Department Technical  Service Gennadiy Kobets told INTERFAX that the flight personnel  of the Khabarovsk Single Aviation Unit would not participate in  the strike on May 18. He suggested that their decision was due  to the telegram received from the Russian Air Transport  Department which considered the strike illegal. Moreover, the  telegram stated that the demands put forward by the strike  committee would be discussed by the Russian Labor Ministry on  May 19.    The participation of flight personnel of Kamchatka in the  general strike is still under question.    Kamchatavia Enterprise General Director Nikolay Nedviga told  INTERFAX that they were following closely the response from  Moscow and were maintaining contacts with the aviation  department. A telegram was received stating that an agreement  had been achieved on practically all aviators' demands.  However, the issue on pensions, it pointed out, must be decided  by the legislative bodies.    Strikers have insisted on implementation of all their  demands. This means that the strike is likely to take place and  Kamchatka air crews will participate in it.</p>

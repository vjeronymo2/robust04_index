			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Moti Bassok] </F>   [Text] An Israeli delegation headed by 'Oded 'Eran,  Foreign Ministry deputy director general, is currently in  Morocco discussing ways to improve economic relations between  the two countries.    Jerusalem believes that despite the fact that King Hassan is  still hesitant to establish diplomatic relations with Israel, in  his meeting with Foreign Minister Peres last week he agreed to  take energetic steps to improve economic relations between the  two countries.    The Foreign Ministry delegation left for Morocco to prepare  for Israel's participation in the talks of the working group on  Middle East economic development in the framework of the  bilateral talks. The deliberations of this committee will open  in the Moroccan capital of Rabat next Thursday and will last  three days. This will be the fifth round of talks for this  committee, and it will be attended by 30 delegations, 14 of  which will come from Arab countries.    The talks will mainly focus on the development of regional  transportation in the Middle East, and cooperation between the  countries on issues of tourism and agriculture. An effort will  be made for the first time to informally discuss the  institutionalization of cooperation.    The Israeli delegation will be headed by Prof. Ya'aqov  Frenkel, Bank of Israel governor, and Uri Savir, Foreign  Ministry deputy director general. It will also include  representatives of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], the Foreign  and Finance Ministries, and the Bank of Israel. The delegation  will also be accompanied by a group of Israeli reporters.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hohhot, April 20 (XINHUA) -- The Inner Mongolia  Autonomous Region in north China has trained a large number of  experts, indicating the formation of a multi-disciplined  scientific and technological system.    In the late 1940s Inner Mongolia had not even the capability  to produce nails or matches.    But since the founding of the People's Republic of China in  1949 the central government has sent experts to help the region  set up universities, and natural and social sciences institutes  there.    By the end of last year the total number of scientists and  experts of various disciplines was 455,000.    The number of experts from minority nationalities is 96,000,  some 61 percent of the region's cadres from ethnic  nationalities. They have achieved remarkable successes in the  fields of veterinary science, medicine, forestry, and new  building materials.    Li Donggen, a professor of the Korean nationality, has  applied remote-sensing technology to forestry resources.    Xu Gorigan, a scholar of the Mongolian nationality, is now  president of Inner Mongolia University. He produced the world's  first test-tube goat and has made new progress in animal  fertilization tests. He received a doctorate in Japan for  research on techniques of external fertilization of sheep.    Female scientists account for almost half of the total. They  are engaged in research into medicine, mechanics, wool spinning  and steel making.    Zhang Jiahua, a professor at the Inner Mongolia Institute of  Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, won a scientific progress  prize for her new polyploidy beet breed.</p>

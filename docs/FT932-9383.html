			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Danish Referendum: Pro-Maastricht tide buoys the Yes campaign - Quiet optimism that the vote will be carried this time MORALE was high at the Copenhagen offices of the pro-Maastricht European Movement, where young volunteers were busy stuffing envelopes and preparing for a final effort to ensure a Yes vote in next Tuesday's second Danish referendum on the treaty. 'We are better organised this time and we have better co-operation among the political parties,' said Mr Lars Bech Pedersen, an organiser of the movement's 150 volunteers campaigning in the capital. 'We are more on the street this time, we have got closer to the public.' Those urging a Yes vote have drawn encouragement from opinion polls less than a week before polling day showing a significant lead for their camp  - comparing favourably with last June when the outcome was a 50.7-49.3 victory for the Noes. The painful memory of that unexpected result has induced a nervous reluctance among Yes campaigners to assume that they will win this time and lift the cloud of uncertainty that has hung over the European Community since the first vote. But two factors have given them hope. First, they can argue that most of the Danes' objections to Maastricht have been overcome by the agreement at last December's Edinburgh summit. This allowed Denmark to opt out of the treaty's provisions on defence co-operation, a common EC currency, Community-wide police co-operation and union citizenship. Second, a change of regime in January putting the country's largest party, the Social Democratic party, at the head of the government has increased the prospect of left-of-centre voters supporting the treaty. Last June, more than 60 per cent of Social Democratic supporters voted No, in defiance of their leadership. This time, opinion polls suggest a majority of them will vote Yes. Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Liberal party leader and foreign minister for 10 years until the change of government, negotiated the Edinburgh opt-outs despite his personal belief that Denmark should accept Maastricht without them. 'I was the one who could persuade the other countries to give us the opt-out deal because they knew that when I said it was necessary, it was true. But, to be honest, it is the Social Democrats who can deliver a Yes on Tuesday.' The seven of parliament's eight parties who are campaigning for a Yes are all doing so individually, often citing very different reasons. Nevertheless, there is a common emphasis that Denmark should remain a core member of the European club, where it can retain an influence on Europe's future. Ms Margrethe Auken, a priest and member of the left-wing Socialist People's party, who was trying to persuade her often doubting colleagues at the party's annual congress last weekend, put it this way: 'If Maastricht falls because we vote No, at worst European co-operation will break up altogether, and at best, even if it doesn't, Denmark will be without any influence on Europe.' The young campaigners for the European Movement say that an objection they often meet on the street is that the political superstructure of Maastricht will submerge small countries like Denmark. Said Mr Bech Pedersen: 'We say that if there is a No vote you would get a super union of Germany and France and perhaps the Benelux countries, which would not be good for Denmark. That would be precisely the strong Germany that Danes are afraid of.' Last year the Yes campaign made some wild warnings about the economic consequences of a No, which proved counter-productive, he said. This year, the pro-Maastricht campaigners have played down the scare tactics, but, all the same, the economy is clearly an important issue. One opinion poll indicated that the decisive factor for most Yes voters is that it will lead to a better climate for the economy at a time when unemployment is running at 12 per cent. 'What it comes down to for most people is economic prosperity versus fears of a loss of independence for Denmark,' said Mr Pedersen's co-campaigner, Mr Niels Kristensen. Recognising the potency of the fears about independence, the prime minister, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, has turned the argument on its head. 'As members of the European Union we shall be adding a dimension to our independence. We must not duck this challenge,' he tells his audiences. 'So if you are worried about independence, vote Yes]' Supporters of the treaty have some confidence that the vote will go their way, but they are not taking anything for granted. 'My credibility as a forecaster was severely damaged last year,' said Mr Ellemann-Jensen. 'I think it will be a Yes this time. But somebody could still goof, and we know, too, that many voters only make up their minds at the last minute.'</p>

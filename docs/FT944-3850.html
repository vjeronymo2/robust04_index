			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Growth): Celltech Celltech Group was founded in 1980 but acquired entrepreneurial zest only when new top management joined a decade later. The company has a strong pipeline of drugs in development, but has not captured City imagination in the way that publicity-adept British Biotech has. Celltech shares have perked up only in recent days as investors realised its burn rate was cushioned by revenues from a manufacturing arm and a series of corporate partnerships. Celltech's disease areas are not good. Asthma, for example, is already quite well treated and it takes a long time for patients to show benefit or otherwise from a new treatment. The company also depends heavily on a technology called monoclonal antibodies, which has not lived up to the expectations held for it in its early days.</p>

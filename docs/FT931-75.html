			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: Malbak rises 12% to R170m for first half MALBAK, the industrial arm of South Africa's Gencor group, increased earnings by 12 per cent to R170m (Dollars 53.6m) for the first half to February, from R152m a year earlier. The company said that the country's difficult political environment and ongoing recession continued to dampen demand in most areas of its business. As a result, turnover rose by 9 per cent - less than the rate of inflation - to R5.39bn from R4.96bn, with operating income 8 per cent up at R388m, compared with R360m. Lower gross margins were offset by productivity improvements and working capital efficiencies. Lower interest charges were largely neutralised by a higher tax charge, leaving attributable earnings 12 per cent up at R170m, compared with R152m. Earnings per share were only 1 per cent higher at 55.5 cents, against 55.1 cents, owing to a larger number of shares in issue. The interim dividend was maintained at 12.5 cents a share. Mr Grant Thomas, chairman, said all the group's seven divisions - food, packaging and paper, healthcare, branded consumer products, international, investments and corporate - had performed solidly. The two largest contributors to earnings - 19 and 17 per cent respectively - were food and packaging and paper. Both increased earnings despite declining volumes. Further progress was made in the reorganisation and rationalisation of SA Druggists, which resulted in considerably improved profits, albeit off a low base.</p>

Sergiyevskiy, candidate of military </F> sciences]    [Text] A result of rapid scientific and technical  progress is the involvement of increasingly new fields of  scientific knowledge in improving weapons. These fields include  those which earlier had practically no military application.  Thus, research in the field of the environment has intensified  foreign armies recently.    An important goal in improving weapons and military  equipment  is to make them independent of climate and weather conditions,  time of day, or time of year. The effectiveness of automated  target search and identification systems and high-precision  weapons, which have become widespread, depends on proper  consideration of the characteristics of the environment and  increases the importance of this factor for success in  conducting combat operations.    Decreasing the visibility of objects in the primary physical  fields entails studying the fine, previously insignificant  mechanisms of their interaction with the environment --  characteristics of the vapor and turbulence trail in the  atmosphere and changes in its chemical and physical properties  on the flight route of airborne vehicles, characteristics of the  fine structure of surface wave action of an ocean wave and its  temperature characteristics, background noise of the ocean and  its bioluminescence, characteristics of passage of acoustic  signals in sediment layers of the ocean bed and shelf, and so  forth. Work in these directions should lead to the creation of  new, nontraditional systems for detecting low-observable and  camouflaged objects.    Knowing the characteristics of the environment makes it  possible to create secretive jamming of signal and  electro-optical intelligence gathering, communications,  navigation, and weapons guidance equipment that is perceived as  the effect of natural geophysical factors.    Promising directions include the use of artificial or  natural  phenomena as elements of military systems. Thus, the property of  the ionosphere to reflect a radio wave of a certain band has  found application for organizing long-range HF communications  and over-the-horizon detection. Nonuniformity of the troposphere  also plays an important role. The task of using artificially  created disturbed areas in the ionosphere for military purposes  is on the agenda. Such areas with an increased concentration of  electrons could serve as sort of mirrors that can be used to  increase the range of reconnaissance, communications, and  electronic warfare. The area of ionosphere excited by an  electromagnetic field of an HF band on two nearby frequencies  can be a very effective source of radio waves of a band of  extremely low frequencies (1-20 Hz) necessary for communicating  with submerged submarines. Other artificially modified areas of  the earth's ionosphere and magnetosphere -- for example,  artificial northern lights -- are also promising for electronic  warfare.    The importance of military applications of astronomy has  increased again. The U.S. Air Force is studying, on a conceptual  level, a system of navigation-time support using radio-frequency  emission of quasars.    In 1990, environmental research in the interests of  optimizing the characteristics and methods of combat employment  of means of warfare (weapon system environics) was recognized  for the first time as a "critical military technology" of the  U.S. Department of Defense. It became one of 20 (later 21) such  technologies and was given the name "Weapon System Environment."  Thus, the importance of this research was noted for achieving  long-term goals of U.S. military-technical policy and its  ability to radically (three-fold or more) improve the functional  characteristics of weapons systems.    With the adoption of the new "national defense" policy in  1992 and the new principles of creating weapons and military  equipment, changes were made to the methodology of structuring  and evaluating advanced military technologies. The latter began  to be called "key" technologies. The new list includes 11 such  technologies, but more capacious ones, since each combines three  to five "critical technologies." "Weapon System Environment" was  included on that list without changes, having a high priority  for all potential areas of scientific and technical  breakthrough.[.sup]1[/]    In connection with the increase in the sensitivity of each  new generation of sensors, weapon systems and methods of their  combat employment increasingly depend on accurate knowledge of  the conditions of the environment (weather, time of year,  terrain relief). Bringing to light the dependence and potential  opportunities for more effective use of armament on these  conditions will help accomplish the task of optimizing the  specifications and performance characteristics of existing and  new systems. Elements of the technology include a whole network  of remote sensors with a wide field of view and high resolution  and new systems for obtaining information.    The technology of taking into account the properties of the  environment of weapons employment differs from other "key  technologies" by the fact that, as a rule, it does not require  development of special equipment. Its inclusion on the list of  priority military scientific research and development is the  result of the fact that it is necessary for the selection,  development, and employment of preferable weapon systems when  accomplishing such tasks as antisubmarine defense, battlefield  reconnaissance, communications, and others.    The basic directions of development of this technology  include: Forecasting the condition of the atmosphere, modeling  ocean conditions, underwater acoustics, environment scenarios,  and remote sounding.    The importance of the environment in employing weapons and  military equipment should increase for three main reasons: A  future military conflict will not be long -- success in the  first battle may be decisive; countering quiet enemy submarines  and stealth aircraft and missiles requires the most accurate  information about the environment; low-intensity local conflicts  increase the demand for information about the environment on a  real-time basis.    Modeling shows that using reliable information about the  environment will make it possible to increase the probability of  acoustic detection of submarines by 30-40 percent, the range of  first detection by 20-80 percent, and the duration of  maintaining contact with the submarine by 20-40 percent. This  will be a decisive factor for repelling an attack by low-noise  enemy submarines and restoring the level of superiority achieved  by the United States in antisubmarine warfare.    Modern high-precision weapons demonstrate an unacceptably  high level of false actuations during testing in various  meteorological conditions. Consideration of environmental  factors already in the weapon designing stage may significantly  decrease this shortcoming.    Electromagnetic disturbances of the ionosphere cause  disruptions in work and errors in target coordinates determined  by over-the-horizon radars. They cause disruptions in  communications (especially HF communications in high latitudes)  and also decrease the probability of detecting stealth targets  (especially at night). At the same time, artificial changing of  the parameters of the ionosphere and its modification (creating  local areas with an increased degree of ionization) can be used  to increase the range of communications and over-the-horizon  detection and position finding, and increase the range of  signals intelligence and electronic intelligence collection and  conducting electronic warfare. Disturbances of the ionosphere  also affect the work of magnetometric instruments for submarine  search and magnetic sensors for minesweepers.    Assigning targets and planning missions, including selecting  weapon systems and tactics, to a large degree depend on the  condition of the environment in which the systems will be used.  Methods of weather forecasting were developed to evaluate target  signatures, background signatures, and atmospheric effects. The  information obtained enables a tactical echelon commander to  select the weapon system and tactics of engaging a target in the  expected weather conditions.    Forecasting the State of the Atmosphere. The  physical processes occurring in the mesosphere at altitudes of  500-800 km have generally been studied well enough to begin  creating forecasting systems designed for supporting tactical  decisions about the combat employment of weapon systems.  Experiments on modeling atmospheric processes on the scale of a  combat operations area confirm the sufficiency of computer  capacities and numerical methods for obtaining the data  necessary for developing forecast models. It is planned to  develop models of the atmosphere on a tactical scale with high  resolution in order to combine data obtained in an individual  combat operations area with regional and global data. This will  provide tactical echelon commanders with forecasts of weather  conditions on the battlefield for a period of three to 48 hours.  Highly accurate forecasts of precipitation and visibility  conditions and propagation of IR-band emissions will be combined  directly with terrain relief models, which will make it possible  to compile forecasts of mobility conditions in the interests of  tactical planning, forecasts of infrared, visual, and  electro-optical signatures of possible targets, and also the  condition of the background for optimum selection of weapon  systems.    Modeling of Ocean Conditions and Underwater  Acoustics. Rapid progress is observed in the development of  models of ocean structures and circulation of its masses, which,  however, is significantly complicated by the huge expanses and  the need to have available means of collecting data about the  underwater and surface situation.    Hydroacoustics comprises the bulk of modeling of ocean  processes, the purpose of which is the successful creation and  employment of means of observing the underwater situation,  combat weapon systems, and countermeasures that are part of  antisubmarine warfare [ASW] systems. The missions accomplished  by this technology include increasing the effectiveness of  detecting, determining the location, and tracking enemy  submarines possessing high technical characteristics. In doing  so, main efforts are concentrated on developing systems of  active sensors, systems designed for use in the Arctic, and  seismic sensors. Models of acoustic beam dispersion and  reverberation are the main components of active systems  associated with hydroacoustics. They are to support both  multipositional hydroacoustic systems of warship groups and  low-frequency active acoustic complexes. Determining the  characteristics of directed acoustic vibrations in the ocean  with a high resolution is of great importance for the  functioning of high-precision active and passive hydroacoustic  systems. New methods of registering data about large expanses  and dynamic statistics are being used in developing modern  hydroacoustic systems.    Environment Scenarios. Measurements and modeling  of dynamic electromagnetic and seismoacoustic processes taking  place on the earth's surface and in the layer of atmosphere  adjacent to it make it possible to simulate the real situation,  which is necessary for evaluation of the characteristics of  prototypes of guided weapon systems and automatic target  identification. Simulation makes it possible in the development  stage, based on a small amount of experimental data, to  formulate additional requirements for weapons systems and  possible scenarios of their use.    Remote Sounding. Today, main efforts in the area  of remote sounding are concentrated on studying the changes in  individual parameters of the environment (for example, wind  velocity and direction, temperature, and humidity) using lidars  and radars, as well as such passive sensors as infrared devices.    Underwater sensors that do not generate a target image make  it possible to obtain additional information necessary for  developing and supporting the operations of future weapon  systems. However, until acoustic technology is successfully  used, the effect of the environment on propagation of acoustic  waves and the "noise-to-signal" ratio must be studied.    The "key technology" in question relates virtually to all  aspects of the U.S. Defense Department's investment strategy,  since all armament and combat operations with its employment  depend on factors of the environment. It has been noted  repeatedly that systems designed without taking into account the  conditions of their employment have demonstrated major  shortcomings.    Today, the following major programs are being implemented  within the framework of the "Weapon System Environment"  technology:    --supporting studies of acoustic factors of the environment  in the interests of antisubmarine warfare (obtaining more  complete operational and design data for close and long-range  acoustic surveillance systems);    --forecasting the acoustic situation (improving acoustic  tactical and technical characteristics of ASW systems based on  forecast models of the ocean state);    --forecasting the interaction of the atmosphere with the  ocean (improving weather forecasting at sea by recording data  about the mutual effect of these means);    --developing new shipborne equipment designed to collect and  disseminate data about the state of the atmosphere and ocean;    --developing tactical-level auxiliary weather support  systems  (increasing the capabilities of individual weather stations  thanks to a more complete combination of regional data with data  coming in from central institutions in accordance with developed  forecasting models).    Navy systems being developed in accordance with these  programs include a highly sensitive hydroacoustic antenna array  and an active low-frequency hydroacoustic system for  antisubmarine warfare.    Data about the atmosphere, space, and the earth's surface  are  taken into account when creating automatic target identification  devices and high-precision weapons for the U.S. Army and Air  Force (appropriations in the amount of about $100 are million  planned for them in the next few years), and also in  developments within the framework of the Strategic Defense  Initiative Organization under plans for deployment of the  first-phase ABM system. To ensure successful collection of data  from many sensors and expansion of the capabilities for making  independent decisions, consideration of environment factors in  the early stages of designing these devices and optimization and  study of the results of their testing take on special importance.    American specialists are developing a weather station for  providing tactical echelon commanders forecasts and information  making it easier to plan combat operations and select the  appropriate weapon systems. When they enter service, models of  weather forecasts in the combat operations areas for a period of  three to 48 hours will be used. They are necessary for taking  into account weather factors during daily planning of combat  activities. These stations will operate in various command and  control echelons and be operated by subunits and meteorology  specialists from the Air Force.    The Defense Department is cooperating closely with other  U.S.  government departments in developing this technology. The  National Agency for Meteorology and Oceanology bears primary  responsibility for conducting observations and disseminating  weather reports and weather forecasts in the United States. It  also finances the program for creating a prototype of a regional  meteorological system designed for studying environment factors  in the areas of armed conflicts. Studies of atmospheric and  oceanic processes are being conducted under the aegis of NASA,  the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency,  the National Science Foundation, and the Department of  Agriculture (Forest Service). NASA and the National Science  Foundation organize limited oceanographic research, and the NASA  program in the area of remote sounding evokes much interest in  the U.S. Defense Department.    Scientific research and development in industry is quite  limited in nature and is basically concentrated on construction  and monitoring of polluted environment. It should be noted that  the technology base of means of monitoring the atmosphere and  ocean in the United States is basically dependent on federal  appropriations. For example, investments of industrial firms in  independent research and development on geophysics are less than  five percent of the appropriations allotted to the Air Force for  this purpose. (By comparison, appropriations of firms for  research and development in the area of electronics exceed 500  percent of the level of similar appropriations to the Air Force).    Agreements concluded by the United States with NATO and  other  western countries are normal in environmental research. The  global nature of the atmosphere and oceans predetermines the  need for international cooperation. For example, there is an  agreement with the FRG on interpretation of synthetic aperture  radar signals reflected from the sea surface. The experience  gained makes it possible to understand the essence and build a  model of complex conditions of a tactical situation and its  dynamics. Today, scientific research and development being  conducted in other countries is aimed at accomplishing the  following tasks: Underwater acoustic research, primarily  associated with collecting bathymetric data; accurate weather  forecasts for individual regions; effective integration of  remote sounding data; improved modeling and simulation of the  dynamics of environmental conditions.    The European Center for Medium-Term Weather Forecasts is the  world's most authoritative institution providing highly reliable  and accurate weather forecasts for a period of 3 to 5 days.  However, little-studied phenomena and subtle changes in the  layers of the atmosphere, which are critically important for 3  and 48-hour forecasts, particularly over oceans where data  collection is limited, continue to pose a serious problem even  for this center.    NATO has a large scientific laboratory (La Spezia, Italy)  which conducts work in the field of oceanography in the  interests of improving antisubmarine defense. In the research  that has been conducted, emphasis was placed on antisubmarine  defense in shallow-water basins, which is of exceptional  importance for NATO allies of the United States.    The U.S. Defense Department has an agreement with Canada on  exchanging data on atmospheric phenomena. It also cooperates  with other NATO countries in conducting full-scale testing of  optico-electronic and infrared sensors in various weather  conditions.    As the role of remote sounding using satellites increases,  data collection and processing systems will improve and expand.  India, China, Brazil, and other countries are actively  developing technologies of various levels in connection with  this.    Several scientific research groups that are part of the NATO  Military Research Committee (especially groups for optics and  infrared technology) are forming a potential mechanism for  sharing the results of fundamental research on problems of  oceanography, the atmosphere, and meteorology. The program of  cooperation on technology issues creates conditions for  accomplishing a number of tasks associated with underwater  systems and radio wave propagation in the atmosphere.    The branches of the U.S. Armed Forces are sharing with other  friendly countries problems concerning them within the framework  of NATO. Main emphasis is on oceanography, underwater acoustics,  the effect of the atmosphere on infrared sensors, and radio wave  propagation. Programs being carried out by the United States  jointly with France and Great Britain are aimed at studying  atmospheric electricity and the electromagnetic effect on flying  vehicles.    Various aspects of base problems of the physics of the  atmosphere and functioning of sensors are included in an  exchange agreement signed between the U.S. Air Force and NATO  and also in a program of cooperation on technology issues.

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Cigarette cloud over BAT's 35% increase SIR Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries, warned yesterday, that the US cigarette price war 'is hurting us and its effects will continue to be felt into 1994 and beyond'. His comments came as the tobacco and financial services group reported a 35 per cent increase in first-half pre-tax profits from Pounds 672m to Pounds 906m. During the six months, the impact of the US cigarette price battle was largely confined to a Dollars 75m (Pounds 50.3m) fall in the trading profits of Brown and Williamson, BAT's US subsidiary, due to stock reductions. However, BAT is to cut the price of its premium brands in the US next month to match the discounting of Marlboro by Philip Morris and of Winston by RJ Reynolds. Overall trading profits from the tobacco business rose from Pounds 518m to Pounds 623m on turnover of Pounds 5.63bn, against Pounds 5.51bn. Excluding a one-off gain of Pounds 135m from the recent cigarette brands swap with American Brands, profits declined 6 per cent, reflecting depressed economic conditions in a number of international markets. The group was also hit by unexpected losses at Eagle Star, its general insurance subsidiary, on mortgage indemnity policies - covering mortgage lenders against losses on sales of repossessed property - underwritten between 1988 and 1990. These losses amounted to Pounds 57m, offsetting profits of Pounds 45m from other areas of Eagle Star's general and life insurance business. 'The surge in mortgage claims took us by surprise both in terms of number and cost,' said Mr Martin Broughton, chief executive. Other areas of Eagle Star's general business showed improvement as a result of a fall in weather and recession-related claims and rises in premium rates. The group's home and motor insurance lines both recorded underwriting profits. The improvement was in spite of expected claims of Pounds 24m from the Bishopsgate bomb in the City of London. Allied Dunbar, the group's UK life insurance arm, and Farmers Group, its US subsidiary, helped boost profits from financial services to more than Pounds 300m. Earnings were helped by a low tax charge of 29.6 per cent, following high take-up of the enhanced share alternative to the cash dividend. Earnings per share grew 66 per cent from 11.8p to 19.6p; and the interim dividend is raised 8 per cent to 7.9p Lex, Page 16; Details, Page 18</p>

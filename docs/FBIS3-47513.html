Quoting a related Seoul source, the YOMIURI SHIMBUN pointed  out that the move to merge Najin and Sonbong is thought to  symbolize North Korea's strategy to ease the economic  difficulties it faces by partially opening its economy.    The Najin and Sonbong region is the core region of the Tumen  River Development Plan launched by the UN Development Program.  In December 1991, North Korea named the region a "free economic  and trade zone," North Korea's equivalent to a special economic  zone.</p>

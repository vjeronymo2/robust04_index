			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: E Europe targeted for growth Caterpillar, the world's largest producer of construction equipment, aims to become the industry's leading force in eastern Europe, said Mr Vito Baumgartner, chairman of Geneva-based Caterpillar Overseas. 'We are very bullish long-term about eastern Europe. Short-term, these countries have very important challenges to overcome. But they will succeed, and that will bring opportunities,' Mr Baumgartner said. Caterpillar does not give turnover figures for eastern Europe, but Dollars 200m of its Dollars 1.6bn European sales last year came from direct sales to the Commonwealth of Independent States. It has no immediate plans to set up construction equipment plants in the region. Mr Baumgartner said that would depend on how sales developed. However, several of its independent dealers in western countries had already established dealerships in the east, with the US company's encouragement. As a result, Caterpillar had dealerships in every eastern European country, except Latvia, and that would be 'taken care of', he said. 'Business has been very good,' said Mr Baumgartner, 'but the Czech Republic was out of the blocks the quickest. Hungary has also done well and we have high hopes for Poland.' Caterpillar's position had been bolstered by Dollars 340m spent streamlining and upgrading European manufacturing facilities - part of the Dollars 1.8bn 'Plant with a Future' programme completed last year.</p>

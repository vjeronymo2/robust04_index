			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Movie Tickets Shoot to $7.50: A major movie theater chain said it will charge  $7.50 a ticket on weekends in its Manhattan theaters, a new national high for  film admissions. Cineplex Odeon, the Toronto-based chain that owns six theater  complexes in New York and New Jersey, said the $7.50 admission price will be in  effect Friday nights and all day Saturday and Sunday. The price represents an  increase of 50 cents a ticket, or 7.14% -- less than the 8.3% increase in the  consumer price index for the same period in New York, according to a Cineplex  statement. Film admissions in most American cities range from $5 to $7.  </P></p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC 'green' currency proposal may not satisfy Germans THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday approved plans to adjust its 'green money' rules, although it was not clear whether by enough to appease Germany, which is demanding protection for its farmers against income losses that would result from further rises in the D-Mark. Brussels wants to widen the margins of currency fluctuation within which the 'green' rates at which EC farm price supports are translated into national currencies are not changed. This would render revaluations of other green currencies at the expense of German farmers less likely. Extra EC pay-outs, moreover, would only be made after the green currency for which adjustment was sought had been down by a sufficient amount for 12 months, although the member state seeking the farm price increase could pay out an advance to its farmers, but out of national funds. All changes in the green money grid have been frozen for the past five weeks as a sop to Germany. Previously they were triggered when the weakest and strongest currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism drifted apart from their central rates by an aggregate of over 4 per cent in total. That total would now be 5 per cent under the commission proposal. Through these modest adjustments, which will be laid before the EC council of farm ministers next Monday in Luxembourg, Brussels is trying to resist German pressure to restore the costly 'switchover' mechanism. Under this arrangement farm prices in all member states would be lifted to follow the rise of the strongest EC currencies. The commission calculates that the turmoil in the exchange rate mechanism from September last year to August 2 - when all currencies in the grid were floated within wide bands - cost the already strained farm budget an extra Ecu1.5bn (Pounds 1.16m) as a result of switchover. Brussels estimates that restoration of switchover would cost an additional Ecu1.6bn in 1994-98 for each 1 per cent revaluation Its own proposals, which call for the member states to finance half of any green adjustments nationally, would cost less than half this. Germany's ability to apply pressure is constrained on two fronts: First, if EC farm prices are re-linked to the D-Mark, this will erode the nearly one third cereal price cut made in last year's reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Those price cuts are aimed at getting EC produce prices down to world market levels after three years, and at minimising the extent to which the EC will have to comply with the 21 per cent curb on subsidised food exports over six years demanded as part of the EC/US Blair House accord for the Uruguay Round farm chapter. France still refuses to accept the Blair House agreement, but a return to the 'switchover' mechanism would make their eventual acceptance of a Uruguay Round deal involving farm trade even more difficult. Second, east German cereals farmers have planted some 350,000 hectares more than they are entitled to under the production restraints in the CAP reform, an overshoot of nearly 10 per cent. Bonn is seeking flexibility from Brussels given the parlous state of the east German economy, and the commission will be seeking flexibility from Germany in the agri-monetary dispute, officials say.</p>

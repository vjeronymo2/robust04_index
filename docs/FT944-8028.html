			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / People: NFC's Ian Barr hits the road Ian Barr, 44. has lost his job as NFC's human resources director following a decision to slim down the London head office of Britain's largest road transportation group. Barr is the second NFC executive to go within the past three months. At the end of August Peter Sherlock, 49, the chief executive, quit after only 18 months in his job and a month later NFC announced that James Watson, 59, the company's chairman and former finance director, intended to retire on December 19. Watson, who joined the group in 1968, took over as chairman in 1991 from Sir Peter Thompson, the man who masterminded probably the most successful employee buy-out of a nationalised industry. However, Watson did not inherit his predecessor's luck. NFC's profits have disappointed, its shares have performed miserably since last year's Pounds 263m rights issue, and the decision to recruit an outsider as chief executive has demoralised what once was a highly motivated workforce. Sherlock, a former director of Bass, was the most senior executive to be brought into NFC's close-knit top management team. Barr, who joined NFC from Chloride in 1989, was the only other outsider. His departure at the end of the year reduces the number of NFC executive directors to four - Robbie Burns, 46, Trevor Larman, 49, Denis Olliver, 50, and Graham Roberts, 44. They are all NFC veterans and have been with the group for an average of 27 years. The timing of Barr's departure - following a review of the corporate head office role - is unusual since NFC is still looking for a new chief executive. However, it is understood that Sir Christopher Bland, who takes over as chairman next month, is already playing an important role behind the scenes at NFC. His next big test will be to find NFC's next chief executive. Robbie Burns is thought to be the most favoured internal candidate but there is some concern that NFC's top management remains too inbred.</p>

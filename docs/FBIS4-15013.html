			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 5 Apr -- "According to the information we  have from the flight recorder, it has been established that the  son and the daughter of a member of the crew, who were flying as  passengers, were on the flight deck. Contrary to the  regulations, he had been demonstrating and explaining the  principles of flying the aircraft". This sensational, and  unfortunately, very sad, news about the reason why the airbus  A-310 fell from the sky was confirmed in an exclusive interview  for an ITAR-TASS correspondent at the public relations  department of the Russian Ministry of Transport. These findings  were based on a first study by members of the government  commission on 4 April of the results of the decoding of  parametric information registered by the on-board recorders.    The Moscow-Hong Kong flight SU-593 of the A-310 aircraft  came  to a tragic end on 22 March near Mezhdurechenck in Kemerovo  Oblast. Seventy-five people died in the crash.    It has been established that the flight from Moscow to  Novokuznetsk was going according to schedule. There were no  indications of any malfunctions of the aircraft, its engines or  systems.    Four minutes after passing Novokuznetsk, as a consequence of  what happened on the flight deck, the airbus "banked to the  right more than it should have done, causing it to descend  steeply and to strike the ground."    A document presented to ITAR-TASS this evening points out  that the actions of the crew and the disaster situation  procedures are being investigated by highly qualified  specialists.    The commission is continuing its work.</p>

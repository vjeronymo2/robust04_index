The part of the Constitution that  states its postulates and dogma will remain untouched, however.    The pact signed by Carlos Menem and Raul Alfonsin, according  to its most enthusiastic defenders, will ensure, "for the first  time in Argentina, a representative, democratic, and historic  Constituent Assembly." This future assembly, say those who are  negotiating the basic premises of the reform, has "legal and  political" guarantees that previous ones lacked.    According to the text approved by the Senate on 21  September,  the delegates to the Constituent Assembly will be elected by the  D'Hont system of proportional representation. Each province and  the Federal Capital will elect a number of delegates equal to  the total number of legislators it sends to the Congress of the  Nation, and in the same proportion: 303 members all together.    The requirements for being a delegate are the same as those  for being a national deputy. Any public official may go to the  Constituent Assembly, except for members of the judiciary. The  delegates will enjoy the same privileges and receive the same  expense allowance as legislators, from the day they are elected  to the date the assembly concludes.    As for duration, the Senate draft says that the assembly  will  begin work within 60 days of the election of delegates, and must  complete its work within 120 days, with no extensions.    The senators also want the assembly to be held in the Entre  Rios city of Parana. Although the final word has not been said  on this matter, the provincial deputies from Santa Fe, for  example, at the insistence of the Progressive Democrats,  approved a draft Thursday requesting the National Congress to  put the assembly in their jurisdiction. They argue that the  province has a historic right to host the assembly: the  Constitution of 1853 was drafted there.  <H5>  Step by Step </H5>   After Congress passes the law calling for reform, elections  will be held to elect delegates to the assembly, although no  date has been set. The timing of the elections depends, among  other things, on the duration of the tug-of-war between the  negotiators of the Justicialist Party (PJ) and the Radical Civic  Union (UCR).    Alberto Garcia Lema, counsel to the Treasury and a member of  the PJ drafting team that has been working on the wording of the  reform pact, says that "if things keep going the way they have  been so far," the election of delegates will take place in  January, February "at the latest." The vacation will be spiced  up by a short election campaign. In March (or April), the  Constituent Assembly will begin its work.    After it has been convened for a fixed date, the assembly  must decide how it is going to operate. Constitutionalist  Ricardo Monner Sans indicates that "all constituent assemblies  have regulated themselves. In other words, they elect their own  officers according to their own criteria; they decide on  internal regulations, the operation of committees, and what kind  of committees they will have."    He gives examples: The 1949 assembly, for example, elected  Col. Domingo Mercante chairman pursuant to a decision by the  Justicialist bloc. At the 1957 assembly, however, Socialist  Nicolas Repetto was elected because he was the oldest delegate.    The schedule will be as follows:     -  Election of officers and approval of provisional rules of  procedure. This will be done at one or more so-called  "preparatory" meetings.    -  Approval of rules of procedure. This  will be done at the first plenary session of the assembly, which  may also involve several meetings.    -  Formation of committees.  There were three committees in the 1957 Constituent Assembly:  Powers and Regulations, Drafting, and General Business. In the  1949 assembly there was also a Constitutional Revision  Committee. One of the tasks of the Powers Committee is to  identify how many members each committee will have and what its  mandate will be.    -  Plenary-session debates on constitutional  amendments. During these debates, delegates will speak  individually, but in the name of the party delegations.    -  Voting  on the new Constitution. At this point, the assembly may also  pass a number of transitory provisions that will indicate, for  example, how the the oaths of allegiance to the new basic law  will be administered.    -  The assembly delegates will swear  allegiance to the new Constitution.    -  The oath will be repeated by  the top authorities of all the branches of government. The first  to swear allegiance will be the president of the nation, who  will then administer the oath to the cabinet ministers. The  presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies will also  take the oath, and will then administer it to all  legislators.       With respect to the judiciary, the transitory provisions  approved by the Constituent Assembly of 1949 provided for the  reappointment of the Supreme Court and all judges. The legality  of their terms was suspended, because the new Constitution  revamped the entire justice system.    According to the draft now being discussed, the Constituent  Assembly does not have sovereignty. It can, however, reject the  reforms proposed by Congress, although in no case can it carry  out reforms, repeals, or additions that have not been specified  by Parliament in its passage of the law calling for  constitutional reform and setting forth the sections to be  amended.    It is clear to everyone that this is a key issue, because if  the Constituent Assembly were declared sovereign, it would  acquire the range of an eagle. Radical Deputy Jorge Vanossi, who  is a constitutional specialist, believes that the Constituent  Assembly "cannot be a mere echo of Congress." Even though the  Menem-Alfonsin pact guarantees a consensual reform, "not all  assembly delegates will give their unquestioning approval."    The last election of Constituent Assembly delegates was in  1957, and it was called by the military regime that in September  1955 had overthrown the government of Juan Domingo Peron. It is  true that that year the delegates were elected under the D'Hont  system for the first time in Argentina, which allowed small  groups (such as the Communist Party and the Labor Party) to be  represented. But Peronism was prohibited, and the vast majority  of Peron supporters cast blank ballots.  <H5>  [Box, p 9] </H5> <H5>  X-Ray of the Constituent Assembly </H5> <H5>  How It Is Elected </H5>    -  Voting is mandatory and by secret ballot. All Argentine  citizens over the age of 18 can vote.    -  As in legislative  elections, the voters choose a slate of assembly delegates by  party.   <H5>    Who May Be a Delegate </H5>    -  Any a native-born or naturalized Argentine citizen over  the age of 25 may be listed on the slate of candidates.    -  Each  delegate must represent a party, as either a member or a  nonmember.    -  As in deputy elections, each province elects its  delegates.    -  All public officials may be delegates, except for  members of the judiciary.    -  The assembly will have 303 delegates,  equal to the number of national deputies and  senators.    -  Privileges: Assembly delegates will enjoy the same  immunity as legislators, from the day they are elected to the  end of their mandate.    -  Expense allowance: Delegates will receive  the same allowance as legislators.   <H5>    Inauguration, Duration, and Operation </H5>    -  Session will open 60 days after the election of  delegates.    -  Session will last 120 days. The assembly may conclude  its deliberations prior to that time, but not after it.    -  Quorum:  Half plus one of the delegates; but the assembly may adopt its  own rules of procedure.   <H5>    Powers </H5>    -  The assembly is free to accept or reject the reforms  proposed by Congress.       Note: The law to be passed by Congress calling for  constitutional reform may modify some of these points.  <H5>  [Box, p 9] </H5> <H5>  It Is Written in History </H5>   Since the Constitution of 1853 was enacted, seven  Constituent  Assemblies have been convened, although only five were actually  held: in 1860, 1866, 1898, 1949, and 1957.    Radical deputy and constitutionalist Jorge Vanossi wrote in  the magazine TODO ES HISTORIA [Everything Is History] that the  1860 Constituent Assembly (held in Santa Fe) "formalized and  made viable" the incorporation of the "State" of Buenos Aires  into the "State" of the Argentine Nation.    Between 1853 and that year, two entities with different  territories, populations, and governments existed side by side:  the Argentine Confederation, which was governed by the  Constitution of 1853, and the State of Buenos Aires, which was  governed by its own Constitution of 1854.    The Constituent Assembly of 1866 (also held in Santa Fe)  introduced a partial amendment to Article 4 of the Constitution,  which dealt with export duties. "No official record of that  assembly's deliberations remains," says Vanossi.    In 1898, this time in the Federal Capital, another assembly  was held to make partial amendments to the Constitution.    In 1949, Congress passed a law declaring that "the revision  and reform of the National Constitution" were necessary "in  order to eliminate, modify, add, and correct its provisions to  better defend the rights of the people and the welfare of the  nation." It was, in fact, a total reform, and among other things  it led to the reelection of Juan Domingo Peron in 1951.    That election of assembly delegates followed the provisions  of the Saenz Pena Act, which provided for a majority and a  single minority. The UCR, the minority, left the site of the  assembly claiming that the convocation of the Constituent  Assembly was "legally nonexistent."    The military government of Gen. Pedro Eugenio Aramburu,  which  overthrew Juan Peron in September 1955, convened another  Constituent Assembly in 1957.    With Peronism banned and Radicalism divided into two  factions, the UCR of the People led by Ricardo Balbin and the  Intransigent Radical Civic Union (UCRI) led by Arturo Frondizi,  the assembly merely reflected the profound divisions in  Argentine society.    The UCRI, which was the political group with the most  delegates in the assembly, showed up for the sole purpose of  impugning the assembly. Having achieved that objective, it left  the assembly hall. A few days later, several representatives of  the UCR of the People also left. Finally, a dozen conservative  delegates left as well.</p>

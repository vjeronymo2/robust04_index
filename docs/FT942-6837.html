			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (15): Keep the workers in the picture - Staff transfers In the marriage of labour and capital, the partners are unequal. Staff are usually the last to know about a crisis that can sometimes lead to divorce. The decision to relocate is often signed, sealed and ready to deliver before anyone gets around to telling most of the people affected. Few companies will then drop the whole idea if a workforce decides not to play. In fact, some are quite happy to leave them behind. 'While costs and better premises are the main factor in moves, some relocators see a definite advantage in shaking up working practices and getting rid of dead wood among staff,' says Ms Caroline Rawson-Gardiner, of property consultants Hillier Parker. They still need to persuade a core group to move, however, and most are shocked by the depth of feeling generated. They appear blind to the feelings of people whom they should know intimately. For instance, one company questioned in a Hillier Parker study was threatened with an action before the Equal Opportunities Court by women workers. They had mobility clauses in their contracts but still felt they could not move because their husbands were primary breadwinners. Three-quarters of relocating staff with a working spouse are concerned about their partner finding work and loss of double income, according to a survey by Black Horse Relocation (BHR) and the CBI. Yet only a third of employers saw this as a problem. The same gap is evident over education of children, which worries 90 per cent of relocating parents but never crossed the minds of two-thirds of company decision-makers. As the typical relocator is a 38-year-old middle-manager with two children and a working spouse, the potential for disruption and loss of key staff is obvious. Even when feathers have been smoothed and workers won over by promises of help, employers still appear to get it wrong. Few staff polled by Black Horse/CBI claimed to have seen information on help for 'trailing' spouses. Almost 40 per cent believed there was no non-financial assistance. Most problems boil down to lack of communication. 'Just knowing someone is there to answer questions can make all the difference,' says Mr John Carolan, managing director of BHR. Many companies use relocation specialists in some way during moves, which means staff should have access to counselling services. Trained advisers can provide information on buying and selling homes, jobs for spouses and details of potential schools in the target area. Some agencies allocate personal counsellors who take responsibility for particular individuals. But only half of all relocators stump up the extra cost for staff counselling. Most relocators tend to call for help from consultants too late, adds Hillier Parker. This is usually once they realise the dissatisfaction among staff - by which time the damage has been done and relationships have been soured. Avoiding hurdles before they appear requires careful planning. The first requirement is a formal relocation policy so staff at least know where they stand. 'Correct timing of a relocation announcement is vital,' says Mr Steve Abbley, managing director of PHH Homequity. 'No company should make known its intentions before establishing its relocation strategy and in particular its policy for employees.' Most major groups have already thought of this: 90 per cent of those with an annual turnover of more than Pounds 500m have a written policy, says BHR. Unfortunately, hardly any include non-financial assistance in these statements. Trouble can flare even when there is a written policy. 'Support from the workforce will only be achieved if the information is believed and trusted,' says Mr Abbley. Companies must also stand their ground once a decision has been taken to move - even if this comes as a shock to workers. Confusion and wavering over whether a relocation will go ahead can be even more harmful to staff relations than the threat of losing key workers. That means doing an exhaustive study about why - and whether - to move. Bringing workers into decision-making can be the glue that holds staff together, says Mr Abbley. Briefing key staff early on about the support available gives them a feeling of importance. The tenor of the follow-up approach is crucial, however. 'We see the workers as our clients nowadays rather than the employers, and treat them accordingly,' says Mr Andrew Finney, managing director of Hambro Countrywide Reloc- ation. That means counselling and advice for whole families rather than just cramming workers into a hall for a lecture. 'All too often, an employee's family is the real source of discontent,' says Mr Abbley. Hillier Parker found that almost half the country's top 500 companies intend to cut costs by relocation. During the recession staff have been forced to tag along. But as the economy revives, alternative job opportunities will emerge. So employers will face twin pressures of needing to rationalise and move but greater difficulty in holding on to key workers. Unless they make greater efforts to improve communications, the divorce rate between capital and labour could soar over the next decade.</p>

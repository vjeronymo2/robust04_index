			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (2): Hopeful signs on the radar screen - Commercial jet makers see a recovery after the turmoil THE world's commercial aircraft industry is confronted with a dichotomy: in the short term it continues to face considerable turmoil but in the longer term it remains optimistic that demand for airliners will recover and growth will be strong. Historically, the industry has always been highly cyclical. But the latest down cycle has been particularly fierce and caused by a unique set of circumstances. It was preceded by a record breaking binge of new aircraft orders by airlines in 1987, 1988 and 1989. A total of Dollars 90bn worth of new jet orders were booked by western manufacturers in 1989 alone. Even after a drop in the number of bookings last year, the total industry backlog of orders at the end of 1991 amounted to Dollars 191bn and 3,158 aircraft. Such a trend was clearly unsustainable. It was followed by economic recession in North America and several parts of Europe which had an inevitable impact on airline profits and new aircraft orders. The situation was exacerbated by the Gulf crisis last year and its profound impact on air travel. In the middle of all this, the end of the Cold War provoked a decline in the defence aerospace market forcing companies to rely increasingly on the commercial side of the business. All this has created huge uncertainty in the jetliner market. Financially pressed airlines have deferred orders and significantly cut capital spending. Some 725 aircraft are lying idle in the Arizona desert. Aircraft manufacturers have been forced to adapt to this new market situation by reducing production of some of their jet programmes and cutting jobs. Even on the most optimistic assumptions of longer term growth, manufacturers now have more than sufficient capacity to meet future demand, says Mr Larry Clarkson, vice president of planning and international development at Boeing, the world's biggest manufacturer of commercial jets. 'Air travel may experience much stronger growth than we now project, but our best guess today is that there is no foreseeable shortfall to 2010 in the world's ability to manufacture commercial aircraft,' he noted recently. 'The problem of excess capacity is even more troubling when you consider what's happening on the military side of aerospace ..sophisticated industries are in place and millions of jobs are at stake,' he added. The contraction in the defence industry is expected to spawn new ventures in commercial aerospace even though the market remains soft. 'It seems clear that the growing problem of excess capacity and defence conversion will have a huge impact on our industry over the next five to ten years,' Mr Clarkson said. 'Within the next decade, we will probably see a change in both the composition of the airframe manufacturers and the types of relationships they have with suppliers,' he forecast. One of the biggest problems facing the industry is the financing of new aircraft orders. In its latest review of the world airline market, Boeing says that airlines will have to turn increasingly to international capital markets to finance future aircraft purchases. More innovative financing will be required to fund future airline jet requirements, especially since Japan, a significant source of aircraft financing, has become reluctant to continue investing heavily in aircraft. Indeed, the contribution of Japanese banks, trading companies and equity investors in aircraft leases is expected to drop from between 55-65 per cent of total commercial aircraft financing to barely 8-12 per cent over the next few years, according to Boeing. Despite all these difficulties, all three leading commercial aircraft manufacturers - Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and the European Airbus consortium  -remain confident of the longer term outlook for the industry with a recovery of world air travel requiring some Dollars 850bn worth of new aircraft between now and 2010. 'We estimate that to meet the demand for air travel some 12,000 new airplanes will have to be delivered between now and 2010, at an average rate of 500-600 aircraft per year,' says Mr Jean Pierson, the Airbus chairman. But this market will be strongly dependent on airlines being willing to replace part of their existing fleets. Mr Pierson expects that of the 12,000 new aircraft deliveries between now and 2010, about 7,000 will involve replacement of old aircraft. After world air travel declined last year for the first time in the history of the jet aircraft, the manufacturers are now expecting it to grow by between 4-5.5 per cent a year to the turn of the century. This growth coupled with congestion problems on the ground at airports and in the air because of inadequate air traffic control systems is expected to boost demand especially for larger widebody aircraft. Boeing is already well into the development of its new widebody twin engine airliner, the 777, while the new Airbus A340 four engine long range aircraft is due to enter service next year. While orders for smaller narrowbody aircraft have fallen sharply during the last year, demand has been more sustained for larger aircraft. All three leading manufacturers are also studying plans to develop ultra-large aircraft capable of transporting 600 to 800 passengers to enter into airline service early in the next century. Up to now, the jumbo market has been dominated by Boeing with the 747 series of airliners. But both Airbus and McDonnell Douglas are planning to challenge Boeing in this niche with new jumbos. 'I believe the design and development of these giant aircraft represents the next great challenge for commercial aviation,' Mr Adam Brown, the planning director of Airbus, told a aviation conference earlier this year. Boeing is studing the possibility of stretching its 747 or building an entirely new extra large aircraft. McDonnell Douglas has already announced its intention to develop a double-decker four engine jumbo, the MD-12, if it can find partners to invest in the project and sufficient airline launch customers. Airbus has also been talking to airlines, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, about a super jumbo. All three manufacturers agree that the costs of developing a new generation of large aircraft are so high that it is bound to involve widespread international cooperation. All three have been seeking to interest Asian aerospace companies to participate in the eventual development of ultra large airliner programmes because the biggest market for such aircraft is expected to be in the Asia-Pacific region, where air traffic is forecast to continue showing above average growth. McDonnell Douglas has been striving to negotiate an equity investment agreement with Taiwan Aerospace, while Boeing and Airbus have been discussing cooperation with the three Japanese manufacturers: Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Fuji Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. The manufacturers, however, are also looking at the smaller end of the airliner market. Boeing is expected to start later this year consulting airlines on a new design of its 737 twin engine narrowbody jets which is expected to involve a new wing and new engines. Airbus is studing the possibility of launching a smaller 125-seat version of its A320 narrowbody aircraft called the A319. McDonnell Douglas also has plans to develop a new medium sized airliner to expand its family of commercial airliners. But their long term expectations remain firmly fixed on the large airliner market. All three are predicting that the average size of jets operated by big international airlines will rise from around 174 seats to 241 seats over the next 20 years. In the Asia-Pacific region, this is likely to be even higher, to around 334 seats. In turn, this is expected to require the delivery of substantial numbers of aircraft very much larger than anything flying today.</p>

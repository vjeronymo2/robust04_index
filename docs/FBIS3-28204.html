The conference took into account the great achievements that  we have scored two and a half years following the seventh party  congress and the fine results that we have obtained in the  framework of the renovation policy adopted by the sixth party  congress. The delegates maintained that we have overcome the  socioeconomic crisis to a very important extent. The national  economy has not only surpassed many difficulties but has also  reached a considerably high growth rate in many domains and  begun to develop dynamically. Continued efforts have been made  to firmly maintain and consolidate political stability,  strengthen the party's leadership role, enhance the work  efficiency of state managment agencies, broaden the  democratization process, and guarantee national defense and  security capabilities. The people's confidence in the party,  state, and the renovation undertaking has been consolidated a  step further. The mass movement to participate in socioeconomic  development has made many changes for the better. Diplomatic  relations have been expanded. Our country's position and  prestige in the world have been enhanced. The international  situation has been improved and developed to the advantage of  our people's national construction and defense cause.    The above-mentioned outstanding achievements have created  necessary conditions for our country to gradually shift to a new  development stage and accelerate the national industrialization  and modernization program. Realities over the past years  testify to the correctness of the party's major renovation  policies and to the appropriateness of its steps. The  resolutions of the sixth and seventh party congresses have been  applied to life.    While taking into account past achievements, our party has  also realized weaknesses, shortcomings, and new problems and  hence has worked out practical policies and solutions to  successfully implement the Seventh Party Congress Resolution.    Lying ahead of our people are great challenges and great  opportunities. Our country is facing great challenges, namely  the danger of lagging further behind economically compared with  many countries in the region and other parts of the world, the  danger of deviating from the socialist path in case we fail to  overcome irregularities in direction for implementation, the  danger posed by corruption and smuggling, and the danger created  by the hostile forces' peaceful evolution strategy and  subversion and military invasion schemes.    Nonetheless, our country is enjoying favorable conditions.  Our party has a correct line and displays unity and  singlemindedness. Our people are hard-working and intelligent,  maintain a steadfast revolutionary stance, and have confidence  in the party's leadership. The achievements of the renovation  undertaking are creating a new source of strength for our  country to move forward. The development of the  scientific-technological revolution and our efforts to integrate  our economic activities in the world economy, broaden our  cooperative ties with the world community, and contribute to  peace in the region have created more important sources of  strength for our nation.    Generally speaking, over the past two and a half years, we  have realized to an important extent the general objectives --  especially economic goals -- set by the seventh party congress.  In the remaining years of the seventh party Central Committee's  term, it is necessary to motivate our entire party, people, and  army to make concerted and outstanding efforts to exploit  favorable opportunities to the full extent, overcome dangers,  and surpass challenges to successfully make our goals come true.    The new economic progress and achievements on the diplomatic  front require us to pay attention not only to problem-solving  methods but also to strategically important policies and  solutions to secure not only more stability but also higher and  steadier economic growth rate.    Therefore, the time has come for us to devote efforts to  accelerating the national industrialization and modernization  program a step further, regarding this move as a strategic task  of primary importance on the economic front. It is necessary to  adopt uniform measures to implement the multisectorial economic  development policy. One the one hand, steps must be taken to  create more favorable conditions for various economic sectors  and business establishments to develop quickly and effectively.  On the other hand, continued efforts are needed to strengthen  and develop the state business sector so it can operate  effectively, assume a key role in the national economy, and  serve as a mainstay in directing and assisting other economic  sectors so they can develop according to socialist orientations.    Continued efforts must be made to renovate the economic  structure, bearing in mind the need to link economic growth with  social progress and social justice. Corruption constitutes one  of the dangers that cause the masses to lose their confidence in  the party and state and that restrain the national renovation  process. The anticorruption struggle constitutes the most  burning and most urgent task at present. Resolute and full  measures must be taken to deal with corruption in the entire  mechanism as well as from the central down to local and  grass-roots levels.    While discussing measures to accelerate economic  renovation, the conference asserted the necessity to renovate  the political system, revamp the party, build a law-governed  state under the party leadership, strengthen relations between  the party and people, enhance the all-people unity bloc, and  strive to improve national defense, security, and diplomatic  activities.    While integrating efforts to build socialism -- our  forefront  task -- we must strive to carry out national defense tasks;  protect our national independence, sovereignty, national  integrity, security, socialism, and the peaceful life of our  people.    Efforts must be made to firmly grasp and satisfactorily  carry  out the common task in national defense and security, firmly  grasp the guiding concepts set by the party Central Committee's  Third Plenum.    Against the background of the complicated situation in the  world and the region, our relations with foreign countries have  increasingly broadened. It is necessary to say that hostile  forces at home and abroad are attempting to carry out their  schemes of peaceful evolution, rebellion, and overthrow using  dangerous and decisive tactics in various forms with the goal of  eliminating socialism and violating our national independence  and sovereignty.    We must strive to build the all-people national defense and  security while upholding the revolutionary vigilance of our  entire party, the armed forces, and people. Efforts must be  made to strengthen and consolidate the political base and the  movement to defend national security, build the people's combat  plan in close association with the all-people national defense  task, build firm and strong defense zones and people's security  frontiers, and strengthen defense plan at various key areas,  thereby firmly defending our national severeignty and  territorial integrity in the sea, the airspace, and at the  border areas. We must strive to firmly maintain our internal  security, detect and curb sabotage activities at home and  abroad, strengthen state management over social security, and  oppose crimes and social vices. Efforts must be made to  renovate the party leadership, enhance the state management over  national defense and security, improve the quality of agencies  and cadres responsible for national defense and security tasks,  and help sectors and echelons to carry out national defense  tasks in accordance with their functions. The ministries of  National Defense and Interior must strive to satisfactorily  carry out their functions and tasks in accordance with their  authority.    Efforts must be made to institutionalize the state laws,  lines, and policies on strengthening national defense and  security; perfect the laws on national defense and security and  on defending the border and sea areas; and supplement and revise  the law on military obligation and other legal documents.  Efforts must also be made to promote the enforcement of the  promulgated laws, integrate efforts to build the people's armed  forces and the revolutionary, regular, seasoned, and modern army.    To triumphantly implement the party resolutions, we must  strive to enhance our political background, the party leadership  and its combat capabilities, enhance the working class'  characteristics and the party's vanguard nature, correctly  implement the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism and Ho  Chi Minh thought on party building task, thereby helping the  party to strengthen its political, ideological, and  organizational background. Efforts must be made to review tasks  and achievements, conduct theoretical studies and researches on  pressing issues, uphold the spirit of independence, sovereignty,  and self-reliance; create unanimity within the party on the  renovation process. We must ensure that all party members have  a firm political stand and are loyal to the party's ideals and  the people's just cause. Efforts must be made to criticize and  overcome deviated concepts and illusions, strive to oppose such  phenomena as opportunism, rightism, revision, dogmatism, and  conservatism; heighten vigilance, and struggle against sabotage  activities of the hostile forces. It our struggle, we must  adopt a correct concept and measures while refraining from using  conservative and dogmatic concepts to oppose opportunism and  revisionism. Reality in the renovation process calls for great  efforts and correct actions. In practice, however, there are  shortcomings in the implementation of the renovation process.  We should strive to promote enthusiasm in implementing this  process to encourage everyone to strengthen their correct  concept and develop their intelligence to contribute to building  the party while hightening vigilance to resolutely oppose  hostile allegations and criticize erronous concepts.    The party's correct lines and resolutions have set new  orientations. However, the effective implementation of these  orientations depends on the creativity and intellegence of each  cadre, party member, echelon, sector, unit, and locality. This  is because truth is concrete and revolution is creative.    Each cadre and party member must strive to firmly grasp the  party and state's lines and policies. They must base on the  political task and the reality of their unit and locality to  study and formulate best measures to fulfill the political  duties while striving to draw on experiences and contribute to  developing and triumphantly implementing the party lines in the  renovation process and in building and defending the socalist  fatherland.</p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (3): Power policy starts to emerge - Private investment is seen as the key to much-needed improvements in electricity supply Pakistanis will find it hard to forget this year's long hot summer. Up to six hours of power cuts in many urban areas caused huge production losses for businesses and industries. In Karachi, Pakistan's business capital, some wealthy residential areas were left without electricity for several days. The cuts were a repeat of widespread black-outs in the early 1990s, at a time when the gap between supply and demand was widening rapidly. Yet while, for many Pakistanis, this year's experience may have been dispiriting, the country's new energy policy aims to improve the electricity supply by attracting private investment. A series of complicated bureaucratic layers, which served only to delay new projects, has been replaced by a 'one window' operation in Islamabad, capable of processing all inquiries and problems. Businessmen and western economists have generally welcomed, too, a generous rate of return being offered to investors. 'There has never been a power policy in this country,' says Mr Shahid Hasan Khan, the prime minister's adviser on economic affairs, and head of a special committee which recommended the new incentives - 'the thrust is now on the private sector,' he says. Investors will, in other words, be expected to take their cue from the fresh ground that the government believes it has broken with its new policy. The government is claiming the credit for commitments worth more than Dollars 12bn, which have been made since its announcement early this year. These include a Dollars 8bn coal-fired power generation project being undertaken by Mr Gordon Wu, the Hong Kong-based business leader, and almost Dollars 3.5bn of investment promised by American businesses. 'We've actually reached a point where a lot of people are very conscious of Pakistan, and see it as a place in which they can look for investment opportunities,' says Mr Daniel Michael Woodroffe, chief executive of the Karachi-based Hub Power project - a joint venture, with Xenel group of Saudi Arabia and National Power of the UK among the largest sponsors. The 1,292MW hub-power project, the largest private sector power project in the developing world, was first conceived eight years ago, and is likely to begin producing in 1996. Despite the optimism from many sides over the schemes that have been put in the pipeline this year, Pakistan still faces the challenge of ensuring that most of these projects are successfully completed. Many prospective investors, able to provide between 20 and 30 per cent of the full costs, are aware of the difficulties involved in arranging full financing by such means as loans. 'For every four to five dollars of demand worldwide, there's only one dollar that can be raised. You've got to be very competitive,' says one American businessman. 'Some (proposals) will fall by the wayside, because they are not well thought through or because there are problems funding them, but a significant proportion will come through,' says Mr Woodroffe, who is optimistic about the future. However, other businessmen and some officials are less certain. Part of the concern is tied to the extent to which Pakistan can improve its ailing transmission infrastructure, to improve the quality of power supply, so that all power generated reaches consumers. The government now plans to invite offers for new contracts worth up to Dollars 5bn for investment in transmission lines and related facilities. Power tariffs, however, will need to be increased - by some estimates, between 40 to 50 per cent - in order to pay for the overhaul of the system. 'It is difficult for a political government to raise these in one go,' says one senior official privately. He explains that a detailed plan to introduce higher rates, to be phased in over a period of time, will be the most important element in the success of the new initiative. Some officials are also concerned that up to 80 per cent of the added load is expected to come from central and northern parts of the province of Punjab, at least 1,000 km away from the port city of Karachi. They argue that new projects set up close to the coast, to avoid breakdowns in the supply of fuels, could face power losses by the time that the transmitted energy reaches its destination. Despite such concerns, most officials and businessmen are convinced that the energy initiative stands at the top of the government's economic agenda, and that the recent incentives have improved prospects for new investments - 'the population of investors in private power has decided that Pakistan is a good place to look (for opportunities),' adds Mr Woodroffe, describing the mood of prospective investors after the new energy policy.</p>

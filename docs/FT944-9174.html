			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (12): Staggering growth of a product here to stay - Equity derivatives: the futures market has increased in importance since the crash of 1987 The recent furore about the dangers and misuses of derivatives has left equity futures and options untouched. Equity derivatives were blamed by some for the stock market crash of 1987. But the recent derivatives problems have been concentrated in the bond market, where speculation on lower interest rates caused some corporations and hedge funds to come unstuck. In fact, the equity futures market has increased enormously in importance since the crash. In London, for example, turnover in the FT-SE 100 Index future has increased from 458,000 contracts in 1987 to 3.1m last year. While the UK leads the rest of Europe in terms of futures use, it still lags behind the US where equities futures turnover is 10 times the volume of the cash market. Often, the futures markets will be portrayed as leading the cash markets up or down, although in practice this is probably an unreal distinction. Nowadays, the two markets are inextricably entwined. A purchase of the index future, for example, is likely at some stage in the chain to result in purchases in the cash market to hedge the transaction. Furthermore, arbitrage keeps the two markets from getting far out of line. Many investment institutions, which 10 years ago might have looked askance at the idea of using derivatives, have come to embrace the market. 'Most equity investors are, by definition, involved in a certain amount of risk. They realise that derivatives can be used to reduce that risk,' said Mark Rushton, a director of the investor coverage group at Swiss Bank Corporation. If an investor wants to put Pounds 100m into the equity market in a quick and efficient manner, then the Footsie future is probably the most suitable vehicle. Options are widely used, but most institutions tend to buy, rather than write (sell). Buying puts is a common means of insurance against a fall in the market or in an individual share. Some institutions do write calls, which gives them extra income but limits the upside on the security. Writing puts, where the downside is unquantifiable, is much more rare. But SBC's Mr Rushton said: 'Some institutions write puts when they have a pot of cash which they are waiting to invest when the market falls.' Over-the-counter options are often used when institutions need to hedge in advance of a particular date, such as a review of their portfolio, which does not fit in with the fixed contract terms used on the exchanges. Institutions may also use over-the-counter options to hedge against an overseas risk, where their portfolio is not particularly correlated with an index future, for example, if their US exposure mostly consists of small stocks not within the S&amp;P 500. The problem with OTC options is, of course, the lack of liquidity, which may encourage all participants in the market to pay close attention to the credit risk of their counterparties. The use of derivatives has also gained a boost from the popularity of 'guaranteed' equity products. These products, sold to private investors, combine an element of equity exposure with a guarantee that the original capital will be returned, normally after five years. Institutions which offer such products usually hedge their exposure via the derivatives market. The past few months have seen a slowdown in the launch of such products, perhaps because of the weakness of the UK stock market, or perhaps because of the rise in bond yields and base rates which started to make other products more competitive. The long-term future of guaranteed products will probably depend on whether the current set of products makes it through the five-year period successfully. If the guarantees are called upon, they must be fulfilled. A product failure would be devastating for private investor confidence. Guaranteed products quietly disguise their link to the world of derivatives. Funds which more openly embrace the derivatives markets have yet to win over the private investor; Fidelity, for example, dropped its futures funds earlier this year. Private investors are slowly warming to the idea of entering the derivatives market directly, through the use of options. One development which may encourage such use is the introduction of rolling settlement, which will put a stop to one of the favourite habits of risk-minded private investors - dealing within the account. Options are a natural alternative for such speculative trading. Of course, such growth carries its dangers, as shown by the reports of private investors' option losses following the crash of 1987. There will undoubtedly be scandals to come, and calls for greater regulation. But the staggering growth of equity derivatives means that few can doubt such products are here to stay.</p>

			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Leading Article: UN killing field 'WE WENT to Somalia to prevent people from starving to death. Now we are killing women and children. It's got to stop.' With those words, Senator John McCain of Arizona last week summed up the dilemma facing the US and other troops participating in the United Nations operation in Somalia. What started as a humanitarian mission has become a military quagmire. What hope the UN ever had of beginning the task of national reconciliation and restoring a semblance of normal administration has been lost. Its troops are locked in a deadly game of cat-and-mouse with Mogadishu's principal warlord, Gen Aideed, and increasing numbers of the capital's citizens are being caught in the crossfire. And for what purpose? Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, blithely insists that the men operating under his flag are engaged in a campaign 'to reconstruct (Somalia's) political, social and material infrastructure', to disarm warring factions, apprehend 'criminal elements' and establish a national police force, prison system and judiciary. That is not how it looks on the ground. Conditions may have improved in the Somali countryside, but the capital risks becoming a killing field. UN officials argue that apprehending Gen Aideed is crucial to their mission and that they cannot allow his shameless use of children as human shields to divert them. But there is at least as great a danger that the onslaught on his fiefdom in southern Mogadishu will simply inflame the situation further. Insufficient effort is being devoted to a political initiative of the sort that alone can give representative Somali leaders a stake in determining their future. Nor do UN officials show much sign of being ready to take on the full civil and administrative responsibilities that their involvement in a country without a government implies. Indeed, they cannot, for their political masters in New York have yet to face up to the consequences of their decisions and make Somalia a UN trusteeship. Their failure to do so leaves the operation in a legal limbo, reliant on a military campaign as open-ended as it is inadequate, and shorn of political legitimacy among Somalis themselves. It is time for Mr Boutros Ghali and for the Security Council to take direct control and reappraise what they are trying to achieve. If they conclude that a broader-based initiative involving political reconciliation and administrative reconstruction is feasible and affordable, they should undertake it without delay. If not, they should pull out. Doing so would not necessarily make it any harder to deliver humanitarian aid than it has already become. And any harm the UN would thereby inflict on the credibility of its peacekeeping operations elsewhere would be small compared with the damage it will do by sinking further into the quagmire.</p>

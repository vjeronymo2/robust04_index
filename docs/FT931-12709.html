			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Japan under pressure to lift economy THE JAPANESE government is under mounting pressure to stimulate the stagnant economy, after a clutch of official figures published yesterday which show that consumer confidence is still deeply depressed. Government figures show that household spending in November rose by just 0.2 per cent from a year before, after adjusting for inflation. Household spending rose by 0.5 per cent in the first 10 months of last year, compared with the same period in 1991, as consumers slashed spending on furniture, household appliances, electronics and gifts, according to figures from the Management and Co-ordination Agency. Prospects for an economic recovery largely hinge on a revival in consumption, which accounts for about 57 per cent of gross national product. The continued weakness of consumer sentiment is fuelling pressure on the Bank of Japan to cut official interest rates and on the government to pledge to cut income taxes this year. Mr Tsuneo Wakai, chairman of the Federation of Bankers' Associations, added his weight to recent calls by other employers' leaders for an income tax cut. Ministers emerging from a regular cabinet meeting acknowledged the mounting pressure for further moves to resuscitate the economy. Mr Hajime Funada, the head of the economic planning agency, said cuts in housing-related taxes were being considered alongside a straight income tax cut. Mr Yoshiro Mori, the trade and industry minister, said the Bank of Japan was seriously considering a further cut in interest rates. However, the Finance Ministry is still holding out against a tax cut which would lead to a rise in government borrowing. The ruling Liberal Democratic party yesterday agreed to a Finance Ministry medium-term plan which envisages the government's dependence on bonds falling from 11.2 per cent of the budget this year to 4.9 per cent in 1995. The economy is likely to remain depressed for the first half of the year, according to the economic planning agency's index of leading indicators which forecast the state of the economy three to six months ahead.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marina Denisova, IZVESTIYA: "Reuters Gives </F> Molchanov Carte Blanche"]    [Text] The largest television companies of the world have  already been introduced into our television. Only the Reuters  agency was left. In April on Channel 1 a program will be aired  which for now has the conventional name "Post Scriptum." Thanks  to the Ostankino television company, Reuters will finally break  into our information field.    On Saturdays there will 50 minutes about all over the world.  It will be an information vinaigrette made up of video materials  on any subject: from fires in the forests of the Amazon to the  Oscar ceremonies--the topics for the program will come from 130  Reuters bureaus scattered throughout the world.    The agency's Moscow office receives "pictures" from all over  the world 24 hours a day. Then the short subjects are sold to  television companies--each takes a maximum of two minutes. And  90 percent of the items are not used. "Post Scriptum" will work  with this material. Initially they wanted to call the program  "The World and Us." Incidentally, this name reflects the subject  matter of the program better, but it sounds fairly hackneyed for  our TV.    Ostankino is placing great hopes in this program. The deputy  chairman of the television and radio company, Grigoriy Shevelev,  at a news conference devoted to the grand new project proudly  emphasized that in principle Russian journalists could create  such a program even without help from Reuters. The problem is  that, as always, we lag behind in technology--both the  production of programs and technical support. Cooperation with  Reuters, which can offer fantastic possibilities for our  television--from the organization of television bridges from any  point on the planet to live interviews with the Queen of England  or Bill Clinton--is extremely advantageous for Channel 1. On the  other hand, Ostankino's image, in Shevelev's opinion, is costing  a great deal. True, this can be debated. At the present time the  television company has lost its best information personnel in  Yevgeniy Kiselev, Tatyana Mitkova, Mikhail Osokin, and other  stars, and the news programs on Channel 1 are regularly  withering before our eyes.    Representatives of the Reuters agency have not spoken about  the project's commercial advantage for their side but they have  not insisted on being called patrons either.    The Ostankino leaders are hoping for the project to be  incredibly successful also because the extremely popular  television journalist Vladimir Molchanov has agreed to host the  program. According to the contract he will not only draw on the  information agency's bottomless well but also will be able to  order Reuters material himself. This is a privilege that none of  our television journalists has ever had before. He will have  complete freedom and independence in selection. And we will be  able to see and judge the results ourselves.    Most likely Reuter's topics will acquire a Russian  interpretation on Vladimir Molchanov's program.    This project is just the beginning of cooperation with  Reuters, which even today is thinking about taking the next  step--creating a joint news program.    "Post Scriptum" will be an information program, but it is  not  intended to have anything in common with "Itogi," "Namedni" or  "Voskresenye." In turn, Molchanov announced that his program  would not be political. Perhaps the viewers will actually see  normal present-day life and not reminiscences of the accursed  past or somber thoughts about a gray future. Looking at the last  authorial programs of the popular journalist and host, many  people were about to decide that Molchanov was "finished." It is  no wonder that his journalist colleagues ask themselves if they  were seeing a dying Molchanov. But we still did not forget that  Vladimir Molchanov is a high-class professional and his  remarkable information-entertainment program "Before and After  Midnight" became a lively political program after the fourth  broadcast. At the same time the lyrical Molchanov cannot get  used to live broadcasting and the fast pace: In times that are  now long past he hosted the "Utro" and "Vremya" programs.    Vladimir Kirillovich himself thinks that the program will be  devoted primarily to the main aspects of the life of  civilization: "We have become very gloomy people. I am afraid  there may not be any people in all the world gloomier than those  in Russia and the former republics of the Soviet Union. So we  want to recall that the world lives not only with problems of  murders, gangsterism, poverty, and racketeering. We hope that  many of our programs will deal with special subjects. Perhaps  the very first program will be devoted to the world of the press  and television."    But fans of the "early" Molchanov should not foster  illusions  about a revival of "Before and After Midnight," which so many  loved. The more so since the old team (Irina Zaytseva,  Aleksandra Livanskaya, and Aleksey Denisov) have their own work  and programs. Moreover, Molchanov does not want "Post Scriptum"  to be called his program.</p>

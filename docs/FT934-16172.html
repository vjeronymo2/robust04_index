			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Government Bonds: Bunds hit highs on Bundesbank chief's comments THE GERMAN government bond market climbed to new highs again, spurred on by heavy futures buying by traders, hedge funds and short-term accounts. The market took cheer from a newspaper interview with Mr Hans Tietmeyer in which the Bundesbank president said he could not rule out further cuts in short-term interest rates, as money supply growth was slowing and inflation was likely to ease. With the Russian crisis abating, dealers said the market is focusing on economic data, in particular the money supply and inflation figures which are due out in the third week of October. The Bundesbank yesterday raised the lowest accepted rate for its variable-rate 35-day repo by one basis point to 6.71 per cent, but the announcement failed to ruffle the bund market. 'It was a tight repo, but it's basically a sign the Bundesbank is pressing the pause button,' said Ms Alison Cottrell, economist at Midland Global Markets. 'The long end has had its run, but the short end of the European markets haven't discounted the likelihood of rate cuts in Germany and France yet,' she added. The bund futures contract opened at 99.45 and reached a high of 99.79, before slipping back to 99.62 by late afternoon. FRENCH government bonds came off their highs, but closed up on the day. The futures contract settled 14 basis points higher at 124.16, against a high of 124.28. One dealer pointed out: 'Both 10-year German and French government bonds are yielding around 6 per cent and there is strong resistance at those levels.' UK government bonds took their cue from Germany, gaining about a quarter of a point. 'The gilt market continues to look firm, taking the view that interest rates are pointing downwards,' said Mr John Kendall, economist at Baring Sterling Bonds. The Liffe gilt futures contract traded in a range of 113.24 to 114.05, and ended at 114.00, a gain of 0.09 on the day. Dealers noted some unofficial supply of gilts by the Bank of England as the market reached the higher levels. RUMOURS of unexpected new supply dealt a blow to the Japanese government bond market, pushing cash and futures prices sharply lower in the afternoon trading session. Dealers said rumours swept the market that the Ministry of Finance had contacted a Japanese banks about the question of additional financing through the bond market. The December futures contract, which had traded in a range of 113.38 to 113.51 in the morning session, fell to a low of 113.02 after lunch on the rumours, before closing at 113.07 in Tokyo. According to Toyo Trust International, 'a scenario of tax cuts of about Y7,000bn to be met with about Y5,000bn in deficit financing, with spending cuts and a small rise in consumption tax looks likely. The market . . . should be preparing to receive an extra Y300-Y400bn in bond issuance per month'. US Treasury prices were little changed in light trading yesterday as market participants continued to trade cautiously before tomorrow's important jobs data. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was unchanged at 103 11/32 , yielding 6.003 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was up  1/32 at 100 1/16 , to yield 3.825 per cent. Prices edged higher at the opening, but failed to hold on to their gains, and for the second consecutive day trading activity on the bond market was restrained by an unwillingness among dealers and investors to commit funds ahead of the September employment report, which is due to be published by the Labor department tomorrow. Analysts are expecting an increase in non-farm payrolls of about 150,000, but concern that the data could include a surprising number, as happened last month when the August figures were released showing an unexpected decline in payrolls, kept many players on the sidelines.</p>

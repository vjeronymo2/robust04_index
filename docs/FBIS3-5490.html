			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- Japan is looking to export  surplus ethylene manufacturing facilities to China in a bid to  help China's chemical industry develop and at the same time ease  a glut in domestic facilities, a government official said Friday  [4 March].    The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is  dispatching a trade mission jointly with petrochemical concerns  and trading houses to China to sell the idea, a ministry  official said. The mission is to meet Chinese Government  officials during a visit from next Thursday through March 13,  the official said.    Japan is ready to provide Chinese firms with low-interest  loans from the Export-Import Bank of Japan if the two sides  reach agreement on the deal, the official added.    Japan has an ethylene-manufacturing capacity of some seven  million tons a year, way above the five million tons needed  domestically every year. Ethylene is a key petrochemical  material used in a wide range of industrial resin products.    China now faces a shortage of petrochemical products such as  resins as it industrializes, according to the official.</p>

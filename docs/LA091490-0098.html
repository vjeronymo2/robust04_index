			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRADE FOR COOK FILLS A NEED  </P> <P> In strengthening their bullpen and guarding against a depleted starting  rotation, the Dodgers acquired left-handed pitcher Dennis Cook from the  Philadelphia Phillies Thursday for catching prospect Darrin Fletcher.  </P> <P> Cook, 27, had an 8-3 record with a 3.56 earned-run average in 13 starts and 29  relief appearances for the Phillies in his second major league season.  </P> <P> Even though he was 5-2 as a starter, with a shutout, two complete games and a  3.59 ERA, he was moved to the Phillies' bullpen because they had three other  left-handed starters.  </P> <P> He is expected to contend for a starting spot with the Dodgers next spring and  could be a starter again as soon as Tuesday in Atlanta, if Mike Hartley's sore  left side does not improve.  </P> <P> "The trainers have told me that there is certainly some doubt as to Mike's  ability to make his next start," said Fred Claire, Dodger vice president.  "Ironically, Dennis last pitched on Tuesday, when Mike pitched, so he could  fill a role for us right away."  </P> <P> Fletcher, who bats left-handed, hit .291 at triple-A Albuquerque with 13 homers  and 65 runs batted in. He was hitless in one at-bat with the Dodgers this  season but had four hits in eight at-bats last year, including a home run and  two RBIs.  </P> <P> The Dodgers could part with him because he had no immediate future with the  club as a backup to left-handed hitting Mike Scioscia. If the Dodgers do not  re-sign Rick Dempsey, next year's backup probably will be right-handed hitting  Carlos Hernandez  </P> <P> "To have two left-handed hitting catchers, that's not a good match," Claire  said.  </P> <P> Claire hopes Cook will nail down a spot either in the bullpen, which lacks  sound left-handers, or in the starting rotation, which is far from set for next  season.  </P> <P> Orel Hershiser and Tim Belcher may not be recovered from shoulder surgery. And  left-hander Fernando Valenzuela, who has engaged in sometimes bitter  negotiations throughout his career, may not be offered the minimum of $2.5  million that it would take to keep him here.  </P> <P> "The question is, can we be deep enough to afford the unexpected?" Claire said.  </P> <P> He would not say if the Dodgers were viewing Cook as a long-term starter or  reliever, admitting only that, "In the short term, his role will be a matter of  need, while in the long term it will be a matter of evaluation."  </P> <P> Manager Tom Lasorda was scouting the Cincinnati Reds in their game against  Houston Thursday night and was unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> "I'm shocked," Cook told reporters about the trade, his second in 15 months.  "But I guess I never fit into (the Phillies') plans down the line. Just to get  into a pennant race is a nice feeling. . . . I don't know how many games behind  (the Dodgers) are, but they obviously think they are still in it.  </P> <P> "Being 8-3 is nothing to sneeze at. I just hope I can go there and pitch well."  </P></p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Guidelines on selection of pupils by ability are eased SCHOOLS will be allowed to accept up to 10 per cent of their intake on the basis of specific abilities under guidelines released yesterday by the Department for Education. Mr Robin Squire, the new education minister, announced that schools which are strong in art, drama, music, sport or technology will be allowed to select up to 10 per cent based on pupils' ability or aptitude in these fields. The education department said: 'A measure of specialisation does not mean selection, which implies choice by the school; instead it means increased choice for parents and pupils.' The inclusion of technology, which is an academic subject within the national curriculum, brought claims that other subjects could be added to the list if the government wished to encourage selection. Mrs Ann Taylor, Labour's education spokeswoman, described 'specialisation' as a code-word for 'selection'. The department said admissions policies should be 'clear, reasonable and objective'. Mr Squire refused to offer encouragement to schools wishing to become grammar schools despite a ruling last week that appeared to show that schools which had opted out of local authority control could make this change without difficulty. He said no conclusions should be drawn from the court decision that Mr John Patten, the education secretary, acted correctly in allowing a school in Penrith, Cumbria, to become selective, even though local consultation had resulted in 55 formal objections to the proposal and only one letter of support. The ruling was justified because the governors supported the proposals, and they were regarded as representatives of their community, the education department said. Under the new guidelines, any school whose character would be changed by selecting pupils on academic criteria will have to undergo a period of statutory consultation.</p>

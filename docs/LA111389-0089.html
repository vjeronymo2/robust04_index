			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> COUNCIL WILL WEIGH REZONING PROPOSALS  </P> <P> The City Council will decide tonight whether a number of properties on the  Balboa Pennisula, around McFadden Square and in West Newport will be rezoned  for low-density residential use.  </P> <P> Most of the properties are currently zoned for commercial or high-density  residential use.  </P> <P> The rezoning, which would be effective 30 days after adoption, would affect new  buildings and renovations to existing buildings. Owners also would be prevented  from subdividing lots.  </P> <P> Some residents have objected to the new zoning because it limits their building  options.  </P> <P> The Planning Commission initiated the rezoning to help limit the areas' density  and voted unanimously in favor of it on Oct. 19.  </P> <P> The council meets at 7:30 p.m. at Newport Beach City Hall.  </P></p>

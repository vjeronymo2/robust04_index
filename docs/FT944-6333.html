			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Arts: Mozart and Schmidt - Concerts At the weekend we had the 25-year-old Mozart's Idomeneo conducted by Colin Davis, now almost venerable, with the London Symphony, and then Mozart's last work and Franz Schmidt's last symphony conducted by young Franz Welser-Most with the London Philharmonic. It was curious to think that Welser-Most is only a year younger than Mozart was when he wrote his Requiem  -whereas 'old' Schmidt was considerably younger than Davis is now. First mention must go to W-M's Schmidt; for the Fourth Symphony is a compact, strangely moving masterpiece, but neither it nor the oeuvre that it crowned is familiar to any London audience. On Sunday most of the well-filled house would have come for the Requiem, and found themselves unexpectedly gripped by the unknown Schmidt. He was a deeply conservative Viennese composer (1874-1939, of mostly Hungarian forbears). Like Mahler - who demanded that Schmidt should play the cello solos whenever he conducted the Vienna Opera - he found his time for composing sharply constricted by his professional commitments. Except in Austria, he was forgotten after the second world war; the music of Schoenberg and his disciples was what excited younger musicians. For this breakthrough alone, W-M deserves kudos. His reading of the Fourth was insistently speedy, of course, and tight-lipped - never quite relaxed or spacious enough to let his players expand with the music (though it was good to hear the Scherzo taken at a bristling Molto vivace at last, unlike any recorded performance I know). But it was intelligent, cogent, even soignee; Schmidt's grave tenderness made itself felt no less than his ingenious, old-fashioned formality. In these post-modern days, the time is ripe for discovering his radiant Third Symphony too, and some luminous chamber music. The time that W-M took for Mozart's Requiem broke all records. Instead of the elevated, slightly disembodied music we usually hear, this Requiem was pressingly dramatic and spikey: the 'Dies irae' became a furious virtuoso exercise. The soloists and the London Philharmonic Choir rose bravely to W-M's frenetic demands. Mozart cannot, surely, have meant quite that - but we were forced to ask ourselves whether the orthodox serene sanctity in this work may not be factitious, even sentimental. At the Barbican the night before, Davis conducted a noble Idomeneo. It is a work close to his heart (he has recorded it twice), and here he had sterling soloists: above all Francisco Araiza's ripely sensitive hero, Susanne Mentzer as his unlucky son (straight-backed, sober, affecting), and Maria Bayo's verdantly pretty voice for Princess Ilia. Nancy Gustafson, whom we know from gentler roles, flashed and snarled as Electra, and Robert Tear weighed in briefly but powerfully as the High Priest. Davis seems untouched by the 'early music' trend - he used a fairly opulent band, and let his singers linger indulgently (and anachronistically) over their recitatives. His sympathetic grasp of the score, however, is second to nobody's. Simon Rattle's memorable South Bank performance a few years back was meaner and leaner; but the gracious breadth of Davis's reading told beautifully in its own terms. In Mozart it is always a special pleasure to hear the music sing with unforced naturalness, whatever debate there may be about 'period' manners.</p>

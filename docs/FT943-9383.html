			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Beales Hunter ahead 18% Beales Hunter, the electrical and refrigeration equipment group which is also involved in the manufacture of men's clothing, lifted pre-tax profits by 18 per cent in the year to May 31. On turnover up from Pounds 47.8m to Pounds 51.6m, including Pounds 1.31m from acquisitions, profits moved ahead to Pounds 2.63m (Pounds 2.24m) pre-tax with a Pounds 117,000 contribution at the operating level from acquisitions. The pre-tax figure was after net interest charged of Pounds 275,000 (Pounds 108,000). Mr David Tittle, chairman, said the results were satisfactory against a background of difficult trading conditions. The refrigeration and electrical divisions had increased profits but the textile side's results 'continued to disappoint'. He said there were continuing signs of a slow but sustained recovery in the economy but indications of an upturn in activity needed to be set against growing pressure for price increases from the group's supply base. Unless that pressure could be resisted or passed on in price increases to customers, he warned that margins would come under pressure. Earnings per share worked through at 19.2p (16.2p) and the dividend for the year is lifted to 9.7p (9.4p) with a proposed final of 7.15p.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Haiti rulers 'to quit today' Haiti's military leader Lieutenant General Raoul Cedras and army chief of staff Brigadier General Philippe Biamby will resign today, a Haitian military spokesman said yesterday, agencies report from Port-au-Prince. Col Jean-Robert Gabriel, on behalf of the Haitian high command, said Lt Gen Cedras would hand over power to second in command Brigadier General Jean-Claude Duperval. Col Gabriel said the plan had been approved on Saturday in Washington by Haitian officers and representatives of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide who is due to return on Saturday. According to some reports Lt Gen Cedras and Brig Gen Biamby were set to leave the country and provisional president Emile Jonassaint would also resign today. Lt Gen Cedras yesterday held separate talks with Mr Jonassaint and Lt Gen Hugh Shelton, the US military commander in Haiti. President Aristide named Brig Gen Duperval to replace Lt Gen Cedras in December 1993 and has given no indication he would withdraw the nomination. Meanwhile, at least 14 people were killed when a suspected paramilitary member drove a truck into a pro-democracy demonstration yesterday in Miragoane, a coastal town west of Port-au-Prince, witnesses said. Twelve people were reported to have been killed instantly and another two were said to have died in hospital. US soldiers blocked off the street and removed the bodies. Demonstrators claimed the driver was a member of the Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti (Fraph), the country's main paramilitary group. It was the second incident in three days of a vehicle driving into supporters of exiled President Aristide. On Friday, a bus drove into a demonstration in St-Marc, killing at least four people.</p>

The BENIN PRESS AGENCY (ABP-BEN) said on Thursday that the  operation, which took place in the high seas, about 20 km off  the Cotonou port, was followed by the landing of troops on the  beaches of the town. Three warships, two French--the "Rhin" and  the "Grandiene"--and one from Benin, the "Patriote", as well as  three French Mirage-F1 jet fighters, took part in the operation,  the agency said.    The planes were moved from the French military base in  Abidjan while the troops were brought in from garrisons in the  Paris area. No incident was recorded during the operation, in  which the French jets destroyed a "target" which was about to  attack the warships. The landing of troops on the Cotonou  beaches to push back an "enemy" attack ended the second day of  the operations.    Observers from Niger, Togo, and Nigerian Armed Forces are  observing the exercise which started Monday. It will end on  Friday.</p>

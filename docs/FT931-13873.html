			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Letter: Further means testing not right route to a modern welfare state Sir, Your leader on Labour's Commission on Social Justice (January 18) poses some of the problems involved in the extension of means-testing, but does not resolve them. Underlying the article is an assumption that the only legitimate aim for a social security system is the minimalist one of relieving poverty after it has already struck; and that the only source of finance for a better deal for people in poverty is the means-testing of so-called 'universal' benefits. But a social security system in a sophisticated modern society should be multi-purpose; and there are far more obvious areas of expenditure (or foregone revenue) which could fund an attack on poverty. Child Poverty Action Group believes that an extension of means-tested benefits is not an appropriate response to the call to 'modernise' the welfare state. First, it would not be able to respond to the current emphasis on individual aspirations. It is very difficult to improve your own situation through your own efforts if you are caught in the inevitable 'poverty trap' caused by withdrawing means-tested benefits as well as paying extra tax and national insurance contributions. Second, further means-testing would inevitably move us further away from individual rights to benefit for women; means-tested benefits are inevitably assessed on the basis of the couple or family unit, in a way no longer considered acceptable for income tax. Third, there seems now to be broad agreement that state help should be enabling, not controlling - yet means-testing gives enormous powers of intervention in the personal lives of the means-tested, and means that even those in work are dependent more on the state's decisions about benefit levels than they are on their own efforts for their financial position. Last but not least, it is difficult, if not impossible, for means-tested benefits to give real 'social security' as a basis on which people can experiment in today's changing labour market patterns, and on which children can rely if their parent(s) move in and out of today's changing family situations. The arguments of today's pro-selectivists are not 'radical', as you claim; they are just wrong. It is a pity that the Financial Times appears to have joined the ranks of the new means-testers.

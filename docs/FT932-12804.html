			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Offers from rivals ease space scramble THE SEARCH for new offices to house the estimated 20,000 workers who have been displaced was helped by offers from suppliers, subsidiaries, and even rivals. The British Bankers' Association said it had been contacted by members with offers to give space in their facilities to other banks and institutions affected by the blast. Daewoo Securities, the Korean securities company, moved its 10 staff into the offices of Coryo International, another Korean company, on London Wall. Bessemer Trust, which occupies 76 Bishopsgate, has moved its 11 staff into Kleinwort Benson's offices. The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan has called on help from Mitsubishi Bank - 'a friendly competitor' - to accommodate its London branch and Dai-Ichi Europe - 'a very close friend' - to accommodate its international branch. Its computer operation is being accommodated in Digital Equipment Company's Tottenham Court Road offices. Surveyors said that the relocation of the occupiers of an estimated 1m sq ft of damaged offices has gone relatively smoothly. 'Compared with last year's explosion outside the Baltic Exchange, the City is better equipped to respond, as many large organisations developed disaster recovery plans for this kind of emergency,' said Mr Robert Calnan of Jones Lang Wootton. The well-laid contingency plans and the glut of empty offices in the City meant that few tenants felt obliged to scramble to find new offices. 'People are not taking swift decisions about the long-term occupation of space,' said Mr Nigel Grice of Drivers Jonas, chartered surveyors. The recession, which has left many companies with surplus space within their own buildings, allowed many to relocate displaced staff in their premises. 'It's been a matter of a judicious use of a shoehorn,' said Willis Corroon, the insurance broker, which has relocated the 500 people who worked in 1 Camomile Street within other buildings in the group. National Westminster Bank and the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation, the two companies that were most affected by the bomb, were able to relocate staff within their existing offices. About 300 of Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's 600 staff were back at work yesterday in two other buildings owned by the bank's parent company HSBC Holdings in Lower Thames Street. The Bank of Scotland, which had three of its offices in the City damaged by the blast, has moved staff temporarily from its chief office in Threadneedle Street and another in Old Broad Street to a third in Bishopsgate. Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett, a US firm of solicitors at 99 Bishopsgate was assessing bomb damage to its offices for the second time in a year. 'This time the damage is more comprehensive,' said Mr Rhett Brandon, a partner. 'But as long as London is a main financial centre, we have to be here.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           WHO HAS MOVED WHERE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Richard Ellis City office,            BPP Bank Training, Berkeley Square House,                142, Uxbridge Road, Berkeley Square                       Shepherd's Bush Green, 071 629 6290                          London W12 8AA                                       081 740 1111  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Tokai Bank, Albert House,             Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett, 1-4 Singer Street, EC2A 4BQ           82-6 Fenchurch Street, EC1 071 283 8500                          071 638 3851  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Daewoo Securities,                    Mitsubishi Corporation Finance, 85, London Wall                       IBM South Bank, 071 638 7207                          76 Upper Ground, SE1                                       071 256 9631  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bessemer Trust,                       Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, 10, Fenchurch Street                  London Branch, Atlas House, 071 256 9200                          1 King Street;  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Osler Renault Ladner,                 International Branch, Broadgate Business Centre,            Dai-Ichi Europe, 199 Bishopsgate                       8-13 Chiswell St 071 256 6444  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Phoenix Securities, 28 Grosvenor Street.

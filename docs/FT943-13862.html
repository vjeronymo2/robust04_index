			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Hospitals 'could cut drug bill by Pounds 50m' National Health Service hospital trusts could save more than Pounds 50m a year by changing their drug purchasing practices, according to a report published today. Hospitals should maximise their use of drugs that have strong competitors and those widely prescribed by general practitioners, says the report from the London office of Roland Berger, a German management consultancy. It says drug discounts average 45 per cent from the list price, but that discounts of up to 95 per cent are possible for drugs that face heavy competition. Drugs that will later be prescribed by GPs when the patient leaves hospital are also offered cheaply. GPs generally prescribe the same drug that a hospital consultant has chosen. Drug companies offer big discounts on such drugs to hospitals and boost profit margins by giving lower discounts to pharmacies which fulfil GP prescriptions, says the report's author Dr Peter Woods. NHS hospitals spend about Pounds 600m a year on drugs and influence much of the rest of the NHS which has a total drugs budget of about Pounds 3bn. The report adds that there are wide disparities between hospitals in the discounts they secure. 'The practices being pursued in the regions where the lowest prices are achieved should be identified and transferred to all the hospital trusts,' says the report. The survey of more than 100 of the UK's trust hospital pharmacists finds that UK manufacturers Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham offer the biggest discounts. Babies born after a pregnancy of less than 25 weeks could be banned from receiving medical treatment because of rising costs, a health authority has warned. Doctors at Sheffield's main maternity unit have been told that if demand for neonatal services continues rising, an 'arbitrary ban' might have to be introduced because of the costs of treating very premature infants and the sometimes disappointing results.

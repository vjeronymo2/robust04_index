			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Arts: Trip a heavy Finn tango - Television MY colleague Christopher Dunkley is away on holiday, so I have been drafted in again to take his place on the historic green sofa. Invariably, people in the gallery world which is my usual beat react with moues of sympathetic disgust when they hear I am switching to pictures that move. In public at least, the super-refined Courtauld graduate still feels it necessary to react as if television was a dirty word. And besides, hasn't everyone heard ad infinitum that British TV is going down the drain? But after a week of square-eying, my impression is that there is an extraordinary amount on the box which rates not just as passable, but as good, even memorably good. Admittedly, the circumstances of a TV critic are special. There, stacked up on the carpet, is the pick of seven days' viewing. The dormouse factor becomes no obstacle to sampling, for example, Tuesday's Donahue, an after-midnight discussion which involved 'a 33-year-old virgin, with a doctor's certificate to prove it, who is looking for a man'. The awesome responsibility of taking on Mr Dunkley's job necessarily means one's tastes become far more catholic. I marvel at what a prodigiously well-stocked mind he must have. All of us construct ring-fences to keep out subjects we believe do not interest us, when in reality it is just a way of keeping some kind of grasp on the things that do. Cut even a modest hole in the fence, and it is amazing the things which clamber inside. Take Finland, a country which I admit ordinarily slips off my mental map - although it edged back on a few years back, after I learned that they have a weekly news broadcast in Latin. But Finland will truly never seem quite the same again after the excellent and howlingly funny Tango in a Minor Key (Saturday, BBC 2), part of the long-running Rhythms of the World. Tango is big in Finland, and has been ever since 1913. Since 1940, it seems tango has become a national obsession, spiced a little with rock for the new generation, but still playing a crucial role in Finnish popular culture - not least, in putting shy Finnish man in touch with Finnish woman. Aki Kaurismaki, Finland's top film-maker, sat hunched beside a birch-tree and a lake, fag in hand. The tango, he assured the interviewer, actually originated in Finland; Argentina only copied it. He uses it in every film he makes - and given Mr Kaurismaki's philosophy of life, they sound like Bergman crossed with Busby Berkeley. He says: 'When you walk on this earth you have to be serious all the time. I hate people who laugh. It goes in my ears. That's why I never laugh.' Tango does not make Finns laugh, or even smile. But on the endless summer nights it attracts Finns to wooden community huts in the forest, ringed by car-parks and hot-dog and booze-stands. Inside, men of all ages sit along on one side on a bench, wearing short-sleeved shirts and expressions ranging from gloom to fury. The women face them on the opposite bench. An electronic display-board announces which sex has the honour of asking for a dance. And you must accept unless the prospective partner is drunk - which is fairly often the case. No one talks. Finns 'are not prone to engage in small talk.' No one laughs. It is not hard to dance the Finnish tango, which is marked lentissimo - like life itself, after all. The lyrics are pretty much the same as popular music everywhere, about love'n'death, except for a particular attachment to songs about following the birds and escaping across the endless water to a blessed isle. An island with palm trees, as it would seem from the painted backdrops. Singers are, if possible, even more lymphatically sad than their audiences. Reigo Tappale used to be a poor wood-chopper, but for decades he has been the king of Tango. His recipe for success is 'not just to stand there thinking of breakfast' and to take the lyrics very seriously indeed. But Tappale does just stand there and belt it out. Gyrating would be seen as unserious. Besides, there is the great example set by the Tango singer of all time, Olavi Virta, who died in 1966. His gift, as an enthusiast explained, was to express the very soul of his native land. Plus: 'he had enormous personal difficulties, also typical of Finland'. It seems that Virta's records still sell in huge quantities. How huge we were not told; if I have a criticism of this glorious programme, it was the absence of figures to back up the claim for tango's dominant position in Finnish cultural life. Do the people who lap up the Latin broadcast, also tune into the tango programmes on Radio Suomi? There was something surprisingly down-beat about Robert Hughes's Barcelona, the Omnibus special (Thursday, BBC 1). This was billed as a personal exploration of the city by Mr Hughes, renowned Australian cultural historian and art critic for Time magazine. He fell in love with Barcelona in 1968. But the tenor of the film suggested that either the love affair has cooled and Mr Hughes would rather be somewhere else, or he has a streak of the Finnish temperament. There was no excitement in what he had to say about Barcelona. The film was lumbered with an over-long historical introduction pitched at the level of the tourist hand-out. Hughes's more idiosyncratic contributions amounted to not a lot, and were dominated by the splenetic reactions of the art critic. He visited a post-modernist night-club where spikey balls are hung under the table to ladder your tights. As proof of Barcelona's 'obsession with design', he evoked the nightly cruising of Barcelonans to admire the neat surgery on the bodies of transvestite prostitutes. He hosted a dinner-party where a miscellaneous bunch of Barcelona intellectuals all spoke at once and rubbished Gaud's church of La Sagrada Familia. Then he left town, pausing to attack the shoddy design and dirty windows at the new airport. Hard to see what makes that a distinctively, revealingly, Barcelonan phenomenon. Two consecutive programmes in the Secret History series (Channel 4, Monday, 9pm) have been well-made and and informative. Last week's dealt with October 17 1961 in Paris. Bystanders, journalists and policemen recalled what happened when police (headed by Maurice Pappon, now under investigation for wartime complicity in the deportation of Jews) brutally attacked Algerian demonstrators. The police fired on the demonstration, made 11,000 arrests, and then continued over days to torture and kill the prisoners. Bodies were found floating down the Seine. It is widely thought that there were 50 deaths, although the official figure remains at only two. However, with the growth of support for Le Pen, the massacre is now beginning to be marked as a day worthy of commemoration. The Last Days of Aldo Moro, this week, was quite as interesting. The extra fillip came from interviews with Red Brigades terrorists who were involved in Moro's kidnap and eventual murder. The executioner spoke from his caged interview room, but the mastermind of operations who wanted to talk, was forbidden to take part by the prison authorities.</p>

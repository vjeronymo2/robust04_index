			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of New Zealand (10): Protection for a unique legacy - Focus on Napier, Hawke Bay province NAPIER, the capital of Hawke Bay province on the east coast of New Zealand's North Island, is a hidden jewel with a tragic history and a glorious, but little known, architectural heritage. The mid-summer sun was shining brightly on February 3, 1931 when an earthquake measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale hit the town without warning, demolishing most of the commercial district. The two and a half minute series of tremors killed 258 people throughout Hawke Bay, including 162 in Napier, then a town of just 16,000, and 93 in Hastings, a few kilometres to the south. The disaster stunned New Zealand, then still a frontier society with less than 100 years of European settlement behind it. But within two years, both Napier and Hastings were rebuilt. The result is one of the best collections of 1930s buildings in the world, including dozens of excellent examples in the Art Deco, Stripped Classical and Spanish Mission styles typical of the decade. Napier is especially valuable because its devastated town centre was rebuilt to a coherent plan by a group of forward-looking local architects for whom the modern styles represented a break with the tragic past. Amazingly, the town's unique architectural legacy was virtually ignored until the mid-1980s, when the proposed demolition of a particularly fine building prompted the formation of an Art Deco Trust to defend the buildings. Mr Robert McGregor, chief executive, says 11 buildings were demolished in the 1980s. A conservation-minded council has introduced planning guidelines to encourage refurbishment, but the threat of further demolition remains. 'Some of the buildings that were knocked down were not greatly important, but our argument is that any building which is lost creates a gap in the smile. It's like losing a front tooth - you still have all your other teeth, but it ruins your appearance,' says Mr McGregor.</p>

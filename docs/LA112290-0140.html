			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SO AIDS PATIENTS DON'T HAVE TO BEAR IT ALL ALONE  </P> <P> As 310 fuzzy teddy bears looked on, Jane Wolff read yet another thank-you note  to her seventh-grade social studies class.  </P> <P> "Your project has brought me a bit of sunshine into my home," she read to 28  beaming pupils from Temple Intermediate School in Rosemead.  </P> <P> Chalk up another success for "Operation Teddy," in which students for more than  three years have raised money to buy teddy bears for people with AIDS.  </P> <P> Students participating in the project, honored recently by the Rosemead City  Council, were to present 400 bears to AIDS support organizations at a school  assembly.  </P> <P> Wolff first brought the AIDS issue into her classroom in 1987, when she told  students about a friend who died of complications from acquired immune  deficiency syndrome. "I saw him die over a period of a year and a half, and  it's awful," Wolff said. "There's nothing you can do. And I knew we had to  educate these kids some way."  </P> <P> Students who saw a People magazine picture of a person with AIDS holding a  teddy bear came up with the idea that led to "Operation Teddy," Wolff said.  </P> <P> Students have raised money by selling candy apples and T-shirts, and by  persuading family members and friends to "adopt" bears for $15 each. Furry  companions bearing names like Vanilla Ice, Honey Bear and George Bush come  complete with adoption certificates signed by "judges" like Ted E. Bare and  "notary publics" like B.Z. Ber and Scarlett O'Beara.  </P> <P> To add some emotional impact to the gift-giving project, students keep the  bears for about one month before handing them to AIDS organizations.  </P> <P> One recipient, All Saints AIDS Service Center, will try to distribute the bears  to patients before Christmas. "It's an emotional experience," said Connie  McCleary, a director at All Saints AIDS Service, a nonprofit agency in Pasadena  that is participating in the project for the second year. "One man, who was in  the hospital and in a lot of pain, said that when he held the teddy bear he  felt like there was less pain."  </P> <P> Another recipient is the Foothill AIDS Project in Pomona. "Because the kids  work so hard to do this, when you look at the bear you think of the child,"  said Allan Ferrill, the project's education director, who received his own  bear, Natasha, last year.  </P> <P> "Even though it's an inanimate object, there's a bonding created because you  think of the child involved."  </P> <P> In addition to "Operation Teddy" -- which has been expanded to other elementary  and intermediate schools in the Garvey School District -- intermediate school  students in gym and science classes receive some information about AIDS, with  an emphasis on prevention through sexual abstinence, said Maureen Bateman,  district supervisor for library/media services.  </P> <P> Richard Gonzalez, 13, who said he wants to become a doctor because he likes  helping people, said he doesn't mind the long hours he puts into "Operation  Teddy" because it's taught him a lot about AIDS.  </P> <P> Gonzalez said that, before attending Wolff's class, interaction with people  with AIDS scared him. "Now I'll go up and shake a man's hand or give a guy a  hug if it's someone I know who has AIDS. It doesn't bother me anymore,"  Gonzalez said.  </P></p>

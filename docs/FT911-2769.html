			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / France to seek co-ordinated EC aid for future refugee crises The French government is to ask its European Community partners to co-ordinate humanitarian aid in future refugee crises in an attempt to speed up and improve the process, writes William Dawkins in Paris. United Nations agencies had moved 'regrettably' slowly to help Kurds fleeing from Iraqi repression, said Mr Bernard Kouchner, French minister for humanitarian affairs and a founder of the charity Medecins sans Frontieres. Mr Kouchner is preparing proposals for EC member states to work together on future emergencies, for debate at the first available meeting of Community foreign ministers.</p>

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / International Company News: Pfizer shares hit by court ruling SHARES in Pfizer fell Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 67 3/8 - about 3.6 per cent - in active trading yesterday morning on news that a California appeal court had opened the door to lawsuits from out-of-state recipients of the company's Shiley heart valve. Pfizer, one of the fastest-growing US pharmaceutical companies, has been trying to put the Shiley litigation to rest for several years. About 50,000 people have received the heart valves made by Pfizer's California-based Shiley unit. The company had appealed against an earlier California superior court decision to allow US recipients of Shiley valves to sue in California, regardless of where they live. That decision has now been upheld by the appeals court. It was decided in the earlier ruling that foreign valve recipients did not have the same constitutional rights to sue in California. Pfizer said it would now seek relief in the California supreme court on the decision. Last year, Pfizer put forward a comprehensive plan in a Cincinnati court which included a Dollars 215m class action settlement and an additional Dollars 300m in reserves to settle fracture claims. The plan, which was accepted by the court, has been appealed and is waiting for a federal appeals court review. Mr Viren Mehta, a partner at Mehta &amp; Isaly in New York, said: 'California courts have an image of being more pro-consumer than other courts. As a result, Pfizer has been trying to keep Shiley out of California, particularly for those patients who are not California residents.' Mr Mehta noted the Cincinnati hearing was more critical 'for the comprehensive settlement of the Shiley saga. If the Cincinnati settlement is upheld by the appellate court, then I think Shiley can be thought of as behind Pfizer even though hundreds of cases are pending'.</p>

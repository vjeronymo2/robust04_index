			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Seven Tories abstain in confidence vote: Clarke in sharp exchange with Lamont - Labour anti-marketeers ignore official party line Seven Conservative backbenchers abstained in the Commons last night when the government secured a majority of 27 in the confidence vote on the bill authorising increased payments to the European Union. A debate dominated by anguished speeches from Tory MPs angered by the government's strong-arm tactics ended with a Labour amendment, describing the bill as unacceptable because of inadequate EU action to combat fraud, being defeated by 330 votes to 303. The government's majority soared to 285 (329-44) when Labour anti-marketeers ignored the party line to abstain and forced a vote against the second reading of the bill. Mr Norman Lamont, the former Conservative chancellor, underlined the risk run by the government in using the confidence weapon. Highlighting the continuing turmoil on the Tory benches over Europe, he called for a redefinition of policy before the crucial EU inter-governmental conferences took place in 1996. The risk that stemmed from making the bill a confidence issue was that it might give the impression that the government would want the Commons to be 'a rubber stamp to whatever is agreed in some European town in 1996'. Mr Lamont reaffirmed his view that Britain should consider all the options, including withdrawal, if it proved impossible to negotiate a special relationship with her EU partners. He clashed with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, over the benefits gained by British taxpayers from the money they provided for the EU. Mr Clarke, who opened the debate on the bill, said that any Tory MP who joined with Labour and the Liberal Democrats in voting for the amendment would be following 'a totally dishonourable course'. He recalled that only Mrs Teresa Gorman, the Conservative MP for Billericay, had criticised the financial agreement made by Mr John Major, the prime minister, at the 1992 Edinburgh summit. Mr Clarke insisted that the cabinet had not resorted to a political 'ploy' in deciding to make approval of the bill - which implemented the agreement - a confidence issue. He said it was obvious that any government which entered into undertakings in an international agreement and required money to support it had to seek the authority of the Commons for the additional expenditure. If the House did not vote for the money increase the government would have 'lost the confidence of parliament'. Britain had joined the EU to increase its influence in the world and add clout to its worldwide policy. He said: 'The Edinburgh deal paid a fair price for those benefits.' While Mr Clarke acknowledged that Britain's net contribution to the EU budget would eventually exceed Pounds 3bn a year, Mr Lamont said that it was the gross figure which provided the true measure of the cost involved. Mr Lamont calculated that the gross contribution, minus the rebate negotiated by Baroness Thatcher when she was prime minister, was Pounds 6bn a year, rising to Pounds 8bn in 1996-97. With support from Tory critics of EU expenditure he said the vast majority of it was spent on projects which would not be chosen by the UK government. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, taunted Mr Major over his failure to open the debate. He said: 'It's rather as if the grand old Duke of York had marched his men up to the top of the hill, made his excuses and then left.' Mr Brown accused the government of seeking a vote of confidence on the eve of the Budget not because the national interest required it but to satisfy the 'imperatives exercised by the bitter feuding inside the Conservative party'. Mr Andrew Smith, in the closing speech from the Opposition front bench, brushed aside ministerial warnings that if the Labour amendment were to be approved Britain would not be able to honour the agreement made at the Edinburgh summit. A government defeat, he said, would result in a general election and the return to office of a Labour government which would be able to introduce a similar bill. Mr David Heathcoat Amory, the paymaster-general, said Labour MPs were voting against a bill even though they were not really opposed to it.</p>

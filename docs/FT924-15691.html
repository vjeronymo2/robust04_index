			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Roche completes record Dollars 275m equity placement ROCHE Holdings, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, yesterday completed the largest stand-alone equity placement in the US market under the Securities and Exchange Commission's rule 144A. The Dollars 275m issue of 10m American depositary receipts (ADRs) was arranged by Merrill Lynch. Rule 144a, introduced in 1990, allows companies not registered with the SEC to place tradable securities with qualified institutional buyers. Roche is also believed to be the first Swiss company to raise fresh equity capital in the US market, according to Merrill. The issue could point to a new trend as Swiss companies become more concerned about the need to look beyond the traditional confines of their domestic market. The 144A offering represents the latest move in Roche's bid to gain a more international investor base. Roche is the only Swiss company to have already adopted international accounting standards, and in July set up a sponsored ADR programme with the Bank of New York. With Dollars 8bn in cash, Roche has no immediate requirement for funding, but is aware of the need to expand its investor base. Only 3 per cent of Roche's revenues come from Switzerland. The company has outgrown the Swiss domestic market and wishes to pave the way for potential funding needs in the future.</p>

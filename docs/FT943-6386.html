			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Ukrainian bid to fight crime Ukraine's president Leonid Kuchma this week moved again to fight crime, with a decree consolidating the country's disparate security services. With crime heading the domestic political agenda, his latest step addresses public concern over what he calls the 'mafiaisation of Ukraine', but carries a potentially high cost in the centralisation of police powers. After authorising police to detain suspects for 30 days without charge last month, Mr Kuchma at the weekend said the general prosecutor, the interior ministry and the security service, heir to the KGB, were to join forces on 'the most difficult cases of crimes in financial and banking services, trade and those committed by public servants'. The move aims to stem the spread of organised crime, but observers are worried that, by centralising investigative efforts in a manner reminiscent of the Soviet period, corruption could be entrenched at high levels, including within agencies charged with fighting it.</p>

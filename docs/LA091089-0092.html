			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAS VEGAS IS BLASE ABOUT PLAN TO MERGE NEWSPAPERS  </P> <P> Usually, a proposal to merge two newspapers into a monopoly evokes all kinds of  protests.  </P> <P> But so far in this desert city, the plan to merge the Las Vegas Sun and Review  Journal, while keeping separate news and editorial staffs, has barely generated  so much as a spark amid the local neon.  </P> <P> Sergio Lalli, managing editor of the Nevada Casino Journal, a trade magazine  covering the gaming industry, has taken out small ads in both papers trying to  raise a protest.  </P> <P> After some trepidation, the local chapter of the Society of Professional  Journalists is meeting to discuss the plan.  </P> <P> The affected unions have complained about the jobs that will be lost in the  consolidation of the business and printing side, but other unions have remained  silent. And one state senator has offered criticism, though the congressional  delegation is in favor.  </P> <P> In contrast, in such cities as Seattle or Detroit, citizens' groups have  demanded and won public hearings and have sued when the local papers proposed  similar so-called newspaper joint operating agreements, which grant special  exemptions to federal antitrust laws under the Newspaper Preservation Act.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Enormous Sway  </P> <P> Still, the concerns raised quietly here are the usual ones: that one newspaper  agency will have the power to dictate advertising rates; that it will smother  potential competition, and that, despite assurances to the contrary, two  newspapers that are business partners cannot truly be editorial rivals.  </P> <P> Some evidence suggests that the papers already have enormous sway over  advertisers, particularly in the absence of much suburban competition. For  instance, both papers already have enough clout to charge hotels a higher rate  for ads than other businesses. And Donrey Media Group owns so much in Nevada --  from the papers in Carson City, Las Vegas and Ely, to one of the country's  biggest outdoor billboard companies, to radio stations and a Reno TV station --  that it already is a force with advertisers.  </P> <P> Smothering competition may be less of a concern. At present, neither paper does  much specialized coverage of suburban areas and thus may be vulnerable to  suburban upstarts. Already since the merger was announced, one suburban weekly  has started up.  </P> <P> As for preserving the editorial spunk of the Sun, some evidence suggests things  could be different from now on. Even Sun President Brian Greenspun admits that  he no longer feels the same animus toward his newspaper rival, nor does he  expect to refer in print to Donrey Chairman Donald Reynolds as "Uncle Piggy,"  as his father did.  </P> <P> "Honestly, that's changed," Greenspun said. "He's saving this newspaper for  whatever his motives."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Studying Plan  </P> <P> One reason for the quiet here is that the Sun is not owned by a large chain, as  the so-called failing paper is in Detroit. Chains, with their great wealth,  usually have a hard time persuading the public that one of their newspapers is  failing, which is what is legally required under the Newspaper Preservation  Act.  </P> <P> Readers in Las Vegas may also be more likely to believe that the Sun is really  in trouble. In a wrinkle that analysts say is unprecedented in the history of  such mergers, the Sun is giving Donrey Media Group $20 million worth of cable  company stock and is taking only 10% of the combined newspaper profits.  Usually, the profit sharing is more equitable.  </P> <P> The Justice Department's antitrust division is now studying the merger plan.  </P></p>

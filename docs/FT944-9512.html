			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Boral wins go-ahead for executive share plan Shareholders in Boral, the large Australian building products company, yesterday forced a poll on two elements of its controversial executive share plan. Although both proposals were subsequently approved by large margins at the annual meeting in Sydney, the shareholder action demonstrated simmering unease among some investors at the proliferation of more generous forms of executive remuneration. Shareholders have expressed fears that the country could be about to adopt US-style reward schemes, while analysts have suggested that - at least in some instances - the conditions designed to give executives incentives through share-based remuneration packages are being made too easy. The first proposal represented an amendment to Boral's executive share plan, allowing the company to pay up to 1 per cent of operating profit before abnormals and tax into a trust, which could be used to acquire shares on behalf of executives. The second concerned the purchase and allocation of shares worth ADollars 225,863 (USDollars 167,306) to Mr Tony Berg, who became managing director of Boral in January. Mr Berg was formerly managing director of Macquarie Bank, the Sydney-based investment bank. Mr Berg's service agreement states that performance incentives and certain entitlement in lieu of superannuation are paid to the executive share plan, and used to buy Boral shares. The permission was sought in relation to incentives/superannuation earned in the period to end-June. Opponents of the motions outvoted supporters at the meeting itself. But both proposals were carried in a poll, with more than 95 per cent of votes in favour. At the meeting, shareholders were told that first-quarter results showed 'a healthy increase' in both sales and profits, and that the full year should be 'a good one'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulaanbaatar, May 26 (OANA-MONTSAME) [dateline as  received] -- The official newspaper "ARDIYN ERH" informs that  the spring session of the Great State Hural has accomplished the  discussion of the draft law on the protection of historical and  cultural monuments. According to the draft law the monuments of  culture and history having been illegally taken abroad should be  declared to be the state-owned property and the responsibility  for their returning home will be born by the Central  Organization of Culture under the jurisdiction of the  government. The law will take force starting 1 September of the  year.    The newspaper publishes an article by an MP T. Sultan [name  as received] devoted to the problem of privatization of houses  in which he is standing for the free turning over the houses to  their tenants. The author provides a number of reasons  explaining his suggestion including that that many old dwelling  houses have already been re-paid, the tenants have to carry out  the repairing at their own expenses and that the state will gain  proper profits in the form of payments for electricity and water  supplies stressing the fact that the city resident has not  mainly got in his possession any other property apart from his  own house where he lives which is the most significant and  strong argument.    According to the newspaper, the former premier of Mongolia  D.  Byambasuren [name as received] has been called to criminal  responsibility as an accused one. The General Prosecutor's  Office charges D. Byambasuren that he when being on the post of  prime minister was well aware of the losses due to banking  arbitrage transactions and did not take proper measures in due  time being thus guilty in irresponsibility in reference to his  official duties which caused great damage to the state.    The newspaper informs that at the invitation of the Great  State Hural a parliamentary delegation from Indonesia headed by  its Deputy-Chairman Surjadi has arrived in Mongolia. The  delegation was met at the airport by the Deputy Chairman of the  Great State Hural of Mongolia J. Gombojab.    The governmental newspaper "DZASGIIN GADZRYN MEDEE" reports  that the president of the country P. Ochirbat will visit the  Dornod Aymag from 25 to 28 May. In the course of the trip the  president will get acquainted with the activities of some border  units and call on the Halhgol and Sumber Somons. Also the Prime  Minister P. Jasray took a working trip to the Dundgobi and  Omnogobi Aymags during which he acquainted with the work of  local enterprises and economic entities and was holding meetings  with the working people.

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Public 'believes profits are used to increase dividends' MOST PEOPLE think a big British company would be most likely to use a large profit to increase dividends and managers' bonuses, according to the latest British Social Attitudes survey. The survey, conducted by Social and Community Planning Research, found 54 per cent believed this would happen, while only 3 per cent thought it should be the company's first priority. A total of 42 per cent favoured investing in machinery, technology, training and research, but only 28 per cent believed it was what the company would do. A more striking variation between beliefs and expectations arose over sharing profits with employees. Only 8 per cent thought a company would improve pay and working conditions as its first priority, while 39 per cent said it should. In the view of 90 per cent of respondents, owners, shareholders, directors and managers benefit most from the profits of British companies - although only 21 per cent think this should be so. Using profits to pay bonuses to top managers - seen by 20 per cent as the most likely course of action - was, says the report, favoured by virtually no one. 'This must cast some doubt on any arguments that Britain has become an opportunity society,' it adds. British Social Attitudes.

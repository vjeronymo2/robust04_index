			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Arts: Opera North stars in the South / Review of 'Gloriana' at Covent Garden With its production of Britten's unlucky Coronation opera Gloriana, Opera North invaded Covent Garden for the first time on Monday. (The company has done several trade-offs with the ENO, but it was never exactly 'Opera North' that we saw at the London Coliseum.) Its moment was well chosen, and so was the piece. This Gloriana - conducted by Paul Daniel, directed by Phyllida Lloyd, designed by Anthony Ward - establishes a new stature for the opera, does that with a whole, committed company, and in so doing reminds us of a path the Royal Opera might have taken 20-odd years ago, but didn't. First, the opera itself (one more London performance on Thursday). By common consent, it bears the restrictive marks of its 1953 origin: semi-official status as 'the Coronation opera', a felt need for pageantry and Englishry - not then Britten's natural inclinations - and a resultant compromise between 'public' music and the intimate kind of music-drama that the composer preferred. Though the crypto-romantic story of Queen Bess and her maverick Earl of Essex (in William Plomer's libretto after Lytton Strachey) seemed to offer both-way opportunities, the final score shifts from foot to foot between Festival of Britain pomp, fey neo-Elizabethan lyricism and darker post-tonal kicks. If those elements are not seamlessly melded in the Opera North show, they are held in a fine, persuasive balance. Ward's stark, effective sets fill up the Royal Opera stage handsomely, glowing in Rick Fisher's light-designs, and his costumes are splendid. Miss Lloyd's staging is clean, cogent, bold, exactly to the purpose: after this production, her Opera North L'Etoile and her London play Six Degrees of Separation, I should trust her with anything. Daniel and his orchestra search deep into the score, and bring it up in high profile with dense, pointed force. The Opera North choruses act as compellingly as they sing. Above all there is Josephine Barstow's Elizabeth I, a marvellous monster of grand feeling and ressentiment, just what Gloriana ideally requires. As usual, she gives us something unique and memorable; if she had been granted a naturally glamorous voice too, she might not have striven (who knows?) to become the great actress-musician that she is. Her Essex is Thomas Randle, whose macho vocal thrust may be inapt for the haunted 'Second Lute Song' but contributes hugely to his developing character, recklessly wild and truculent. On this page last December, Max Loppert praised the production and its principals after its Leeds premiere. I should add only some tributes to Paul Nilon's elegantly sung 'Spirit of the Masque' (which is choreographed to firm dramatic purpose by Kate Flatt, like the courtly dances later); Hilary Jackson's diamond-cut lady-in-waiting; and David Gwynne's ripe Ballad Singer. Opera North cultivates a regular company of such artists, whereas the Royal Opera nowadays keeps only a few third-leads and comprimarios on contract - thus condemning itself (unlike the New York Met, or La Scala or the Vienna Opera) to largely bought-in casts, and leaving the ENO as the metropolitan house where the best British singers can find their feet and develop. That division strikes me as artificial and short-sighted. Just why should London's 'premier' opera house be content to serve as a profitable stop for international stars in transit? The Russian conductor Gennadi Rozhdestvensky has withdrawn from the new Royal Opera production of Massenet's Cherubin because of artistic differences, writes Antony Thorncroft. The romantic opera will open, as scheduled, on Monday, February 14 with Mario Bernardi in the pit. A busy work schedule limited Rozhdestvensky's appearances at rehearsals and some of the young singers in the production, which is directed by Tim Albery, found him difficult to work with. Mario Bernardi has conducted the work at the Santa Fe Opera. Original Gloriana sponsors: Nottinghamshire County Council and the Britten Estate.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, April 23 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai today  started to construct its international textile town--the first  textile new and high technology development zone in China.    Located in Qingpu County of Shanghai City, the town is  planned to occupy 2.13 hectares.    Wu Wenying, president of the China National Textile Council,  said here today that the construction of the town is a new  exploration and will serve as a guide for technological progress  and readjustment of the structure of the textile industry in the  country.    She said that the textile industry is one of the traditional  industries in China. At present, its output value accounts for  14.4 percent of the total output value in the country.    But, she noted, China's textile industry is also facing  development difficulties.    The construction of the textile town is aimed at setting up  an international commodity-oriented industrial town with new and  high technology.    Now the town has signed contracts with its counterparts in  Germany, the United States and the Republic of Korea for  projects with a total investment of 180 million U.S. dollars.</p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Metals finish on a high note Metals markets finished in a buoyant mood this week with the precious sector resuming its earlier uptrend and copper leading a late surge at the London Metal Exchange. Gold reached a 13-month high, copper a 25-month high and aluminium a 3 3/4 -year high. Bullion dealers said the gold market appeared to be bracing itself for a fresh assault on the Dollars 400-a-troy ounce barrier as a Dollars 2.20 rise yesterday took the price to Dollars 396, up Dollars 5.40 on the week. That followed an overnight jump in response to the strength of the New York silver market. In London cash silver ended at Dollars 5.70 1/2 an ounce, up 9 cents on the day and 21 cents on the week. 'People were playing the (silver-gold) spread so gold followed suit,' a dealer told the Reuters news agency. 'A lot of aggressive buying has been done to maximise impact, which argues for caution,' said Andy Smith, bullion analyst as Union Bank of Switzerland. . . Maybe they are right (that the gold price will go to Dollars 400), but they have to take profits sometime.' 'Everybody is bullish and talking about Dollars 400,' said another analyst. 'But all the indicators point to it being overbought.' 'We haven't seen sustained demand like this for years,' commented a dealer. 'It means the rule book goes out the window.' Platinum followed the trend, a Dollars 2.75 rise to Dollars 421 an ounce yesterday taking the advance on the week to Dollars 11.75. For the base metals generally bullish fundamentals were bolstered by bouts of speculative buying as copper and aluminium led an across-the-board rise yesterday. Having consolidated earlier gains, the three months delivery copper price, fuelled by commission house buying that triggered stop-loss orders, broke through resistance to close at Dollars 2,570.50 a tonne, up Dollars 63 on the week and the highest level since August 1992. It moved further ahead in after hours trading. The aluminium market was bolstered by news of a 19,700-tonne fall in LME warehouse stocks, which followed one of 13,675 tonnes announced and took the week's drawdown to 1.4 per cent. The three months price closed Dollars 8 higher at Dollars 1,631.50 a tonne, taking the gain on the week to Dollars 23, after edging back from a peak of Dollars 1,636 a tonne. Zinc, with its continuing overproduction, has been the Cinderella contract at the LME for some time. But it was able to join in the party yesterday following news that Norzink of Norway planned to cut output by up to 20 per cent next year at its 140,000-tonnes-a-year Odda smelter. In response the three months zinc price reversed its Dollars 10 decline over the previous four days to close at Dollars 1,045.50 a tonne, up Dollars 13 on balance. Norzink's announcement was welcomed by Union Miniere, which two years ago closed its 120,000-tonnes-a-year Overpelt smelter. But the Belgian group cautioned that further producer cuts would be needed to reverse the continuing build-up in world zinc stocks. At the London Commodity Exchange meanwhile, coffee futures were moving back towards the 9-year highs reached earlier in the week. By the close the November position was trading at Dollars 4,068 a tonne, up Dollars 23 on the day and Dollars 136 on the week. But that was still Dollars 72 below the peak to which it had been lifted at one point on Thursday by concern about the continuing drought in Brazilian growing areas.  -------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  -------------------------------------------- Aluminium          -19,700 to 2,349,675 Aluminium alloy       -280 to    25,460 Copper              -1,750 to   366,300 Lead                  -925 to   367,075 Nickel              +1,170 to   143,238 Zinc                  +225 to 1,234,200 Tin                   -110 to    32,155  --------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Components side helps lift T&amp;N 14% to Pounds 39m T&amp;N, the motor components and engineering group, boosted first half pre-tax profits by 13.5 per cent to Pounds 39.4m in spite of what the directors described as 'severe recessionary conditions in continental Europe.' Mr Colin Hope, chairman and chief executive, said the group's automotive component businesses had provided most of the increase, although the bearings and friction products divisions had also made increased contributions. He said T&amp;N had improved margins in the period to end-June from 7.8 per cent to 8.3 per cent. Customer demand in Europe was continuing to decline, and it would be some time before a recovery was seen. While the UK would be hampered by the European recession, brighter conditions were seen in North America and the Far East. 'Much potential exists for further market share gains and margin improvement,' he added. Trading profits in North America, where the group now supplies all three Japanese motor makers, were up 50 per cent to Pounds 18.8m (Pounds 12.5m). In the UK, which lifted direct exports by 8 per cent, trading profits were 18 per cent ahead at Pounds 24.5m (Pounds 20.7m). Mr Hope said that elsewhere, in very difficult trading conditions, profits had been maintained at similar levels to last year. Group turnover was 8.7 per cent higher at Pounds 774.5m (Pounds 712m). Operating profits were up by 15 per cent at Pounds 54.2m (Pounds 47.1m) after allowing provisions of Pounds 9.8m (Pounds 8.5m) for claims related to its former asbestos activities. Earnings per share were 5p (4p). The group is proposing an unchanged full-year dividend of 10.85p, payable at the interim, with the alternative of an enhanced scrip dividend valued at 16.275p per ordinary share. Hoare Govett is offering to buy the scrip shares for not less than 98 per cent of face value, or about 15.95p. If all shareholders took the enhanced dividend, T&amp;N said it would save Pounds 50m cash on dividend payments and Pounds 14.5m on advanced corporation tax. T&amp;N completed the DM250m (Pounds 100m) acquisition of Goetze, the German piston ring producer, in June, when the first instalment of DM90m was paid and 21.9m T&amp;N shares were placed to raise Pounds 37m. Rationalising Goetze's activities were on course. Net borrowings at June 30 were Pounds 425.5m, up from Pounds 239.2m at the end of last year and giving gearing of 80 per cent. COMMENT Given the prevailing trading conditions in the motor sector, this is a very good set of results. Raising margins in this climate is a rare feat which shows that the drive to cut costs and boost market share is paying off. T&amp;N has kept its shareholders loyal during a near-decade of restructuring by offering them a high yield. Their cup runs over with payment of an enhanced scrip dividend in full at the interim stage. Holders of the stock this calendar year will enjoy a yield near 10 per cent. Questions remain over who will hang on when the shares go ex-dividend - yield fund managers will certainly start to look elsewhere as they stare at a less prosperous 1994. But it could mark the transformation of T&amp;N from a yield stock to a growth stock.</p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / German Interest Rate Rise: Symbolic increase by central bank THE Bundesbank tightened the monetary screw a little more yesterday, but argued that it had taken care to avoid drawing howls of pain from the rest of Europe while seeking to reduce inflationary pressures in Germany. Only time will tell whether it will succeed. As expected, the 18-man central bank council made no change in the Lombard rate of 9.75 per cent, which sets the ceiling for money market rates. An increase in this rate would have upset financial markets and put pressure on other countries to follow suit. Instead, it raised the cost of commercial banks' refinancing to reduce credit flow to companies and individuals by making it more expensive. This, too, was expected in the form of a rise in the discount rate, but the Bundesbank maintained its capacity for surprise by moving this up by 0.75 percentage points to 8.75 per cent, its highest since 1931. 'We thought the Bundesbank would do something symbolic,' said Mr Dieter Wermuth, managing director of Caisse des Depots et Consignations' Frankfurt subsidiary. 'This is more or less symbolic'. Mr Hermann Remsperger, chief economist of BHF-Bank, went a little further. 'It was another pinprick to emphasise the Bundesbank's restrictive policy'. 'We were seeking a solution appropriate for the domestic situation and which tries to avoid any complications for our partner countries'. He gave no indication the council had been split by the desire to tighten policy further and avoid monetary overkill. There was another modest surprise, in that the bank did not restrict access to its funds to reinforce the interest rate move. The bank reaffirmed its money supply target of 3.5-5.5 per cent for M3, which has been growing at an annual rate of some 9 per cent. Mr Schlesinger again stressed the Bundesbank's anxiety that inflation, recently above 4 per cent, was too high. Its medium-term goal, incorporated into the M3 target, is 2 per cent. He said money supply could not be allowed to continue expanding at recent rates in view of the inflationary pressures which could be exacerbated by next January's one percentage point rise in value-added tax. He was unhappy also about price trends in east Germany, where inflation was around 6.5 per cent (excluding rises in rents from subsidised levels under the old regime). Building prices in the east, where economic reconstruction is getting under way, were some 20 per cent above those in the west. Nor did he like the public sector wage deal which will put east German pay at 80 per cent of the west German level in mid-1993. It is the costs of rebuilding the east German economy that have led to the Bundesbank's problems. But while Mr Schlesinger was pleased at the Bonn government's efforts to curb the budget deficit, he was less happy at the continued spending plans of the regional states, local authorities, and social security bodies. The main problem from unification for M3 has been the rush of lending to finance investments in the east. This is beneficial in broad economic terms. But because corporate investments in east Germany are subsidised, roughly a sixth of all German bank lending to companies and private persons is highly insensitive to interest rate moves. This means rates have to be even higher to affect bank lending, which has risen at an annual 11.5 per cent this year. Mr Schlesinger said the latest M3 growth figure for May was 8.7 per cent, slightly less than the 9 per cent first reported.</p>

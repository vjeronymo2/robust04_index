			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Austria promises to reopen hostels CARITAS, the Roman Catholic charitable agency, says it has been assured by the mayor of Vienna that the city will re-open its hostels to Bosnian refugees within a few days. Mr Helmut Schuler, director of Caritas in Austria, said he accepted the city's decision last Friday to close its crowded hostels temporarily. Attempts were being made to send more refugees to provincial cities and to find suitable winter accommodation for many of those already in Vienna. Mr Schuler feared that some politicians would use the refugee-related troubles in Germany as an excuse to prolong the closure. If so, Caritas would continue to put pressure on the government. 'It is impossible to say that we cannot accept real refugees,' he said. He pointed out that the situation in Austria was not comparable to that in Germany. Half the 50,000 Bosnian refugees in Austria were staying with friends or relatives, and another 25 per cent were in the homes of private citizens. Bosnian refugees arriving in Vienna now faced a 'confused' situation'. The city's hostels were turning them away but charitable organisations were trying to find shelter for everyone. Mr Schuler was critical of other western European countries for not taking more refugees. The Danish minority government faced a critical situation in the Folketing last night, where it appeared to be in danger of defeat over a proposal to send just under 200 Danish soldiers to the former Yugoslavia to help protect UN food convoys, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. The opposition Social Democratic party was insisting that the government could only send volunteers, a restriction which Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, foreign minister in the Conservative-Liberal minority government, described as 'totally unacceptable'. The parties were last night trying to find a formula which could satisfy both sides, but if these efforts fail, a combination of the Social Democratic party, the Radical party and the left-wing Socialist People's party was prepared to defeat the government. The concluding debate on the government proposal was due to start late last night, but Folketing officials said that in view of the critical situation, the debate could be postponed until today.</p>

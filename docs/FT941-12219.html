			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Move to mend banana split - A revised European import regime proposal The European Commission is believed to be considering a plan that would end its row with Latin American countries over access to the Dollars 2.7bn European banana market which might be put before a committee meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade today. It would not be the first solution proposed to end this arcane dispute which has cast a shadow over relations between the European Union and Latin American producers for more than two years. Tempers in the EU rarely run as high as they do over bananas. The complex row, founded in the EU's obligation, under the Lome preferential trade convention, to import bananas from former colonies of Britain and France, has set commissioners against each other and opened divisions between member countries. Germany has made its own complaint to the European Court. Many member countries are critical of the Commission's handling of the dispute but have been unable to hammer out a policy which has their majority backing. At the same time, a rift has developed between the group of Latin American producers over their response to proposals put by the Commission last year. At a meeting in Guatemala on Friday, the group of five Latin American producers along with Ecuador and Mexico failed to reached agreement on ending the stalemate but will meet again in Panama on Saturday. Earlier this month the Latin Americans rejected proposals put by the Commission to allow them a ceiling of 2.1m tonnes of banana imports to the EU this year, breaking down into individual country quotas. These would also be subject to tariff payments. The Commission had put great pressure on the producers to accept its plan - a ceiling of 2m tonnes was imposed last July. But producers have complained to Gatt about the EU banana regime and a condition of accepting the improved ceiling was that they drop that complaint. One of the ways the Commission brought pressure to bear on producers was to threaten to withdraw the offer if the Latin Americans had not accepted it by the time Gatt issued its report on the banana regime. However, the Commission has since extended its deadline for agreement to February 11 which is when the Gatt report will be circulated to all members. The Commission is believed to be looking at improving the latest offer by slightly increasing the overall import ceiling and removing individual country quotas for those that are unhappy with them. Those countries - in particular Guatemala, which objected strongly to the previous plan - would then compete with each other for import access within the overall ceiling. However, the idea of the ceiling still irks the Latin Americans when, in fact, there is strong demand for their bananas in Europe. 'It's a contradiction: they want us to open up to free trade under Gatt on the one hand, but accept restrictions on certain products like bananas,' said a central American ambassador. The African, Caribbean and Pacific countries covered by the Lome convention claim their economies would be devastated if they had to compete freely for EU banana business. Production costs in the ACP countries are much higher than in Latin America where fruit is also of a uniformly high quality. 'Logic dictates that the central Americans which grow the best bananas at the cheapest price should be able to provide the best deal for the EU consumer, but since when has logic ever dictated EU agriculture policy?' said Mr John Wakeley, food and drink analyst at Lehman Brothers. Latin American producers have been supplying up to 2.3m tonnes of the 3.6m-tonne EU banana market in the past couple of years. These so-called 'dollar' bananas can still be sold more cheaply than those from ACP countries even after payment of tariffs since production costs can be a third lower on the more highly mechanised plantations in central America. In a rush to secure market share Latin American producers last year flooded the EU market with fruit. This led to a slump in prices. The market has been further confused by Germany's complaint to the European Court calling for a free market for bananas. The Germans even suggested at a Gatt meeting last week that the EU's Lome commitments on bananas be abandoned altogether. In the meantime, observers suggest that German banana distributors are ignoring the EU rules and continuing to import freely. This could be happening to a lesser extent in the Netherlands, Denmark and Belgium. Banana distributors such as Geest, which has warned it would make a loss for last year, bemoan the political squabbles which have cast a shadow over the market. 'I think it's almost unprecedented in any sphere where government and industry bump against each other,' said Ms Clare Wenner, external affairs director at Geest. 'It makes it extremely difficult to know how to plan for the long term.' The Gatt report on the EU's banana regime has not yet been made public but is understood to criticise the Lome arrangements as not in keeping with its free trade rules. This is, however, a moral rather than a practical victory for Latin American producers as the report will almost certainly not be adopted by Gatt - any member can block the majority needed to adopt the report. The EU could now be forced to apply for an exemption to Gatt rules specifically for Lome. There is even a narrow chance that problems over bananas could hold up the signing of the Uruguay Round accord as they delayed the signing of the Treaty of Rome that created the European Community in 1957.</p>

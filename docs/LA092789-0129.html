			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE / CHRIS PASLES: 'SACRED SOUNDS' TO ACCOMPANY 'HARMONIA' AFFAIR  </P> <P> While Catholic, Jewish, Hindu and Muslim mystics -- including Tenzin Gyatso,  the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet -- are gathering with scientists next week in  Newport Beach for a spiritual conference called "Harmonia Mundi," a companion  evening series has been planned to focus on inspirational music and poetry.  </P> <P> "Sacred Voices, Sacred Sounds" will explore "how music is utilized to transform  consciousness and awareness," says Ronald Wong Jue, founder and president of  the East-West Foundation, which is sponsoring the six-day conference that opens  Monday at the Marriott and Le Meridien hotels.  </P> <P> "Music really elevates people's awareness of spiritual values," Jue said in a  recent interview. "If you want to get in touch with the spiritual, I'd rather  hear Bach than just read about (the subject)."  </P> <P> The evening events are a separate series from the "Harmonia Mundi" daytime  conference. There is an admission charge, but the public does not have to  register for the conference.  </P> <P> Among the artists participating in the evening series, at UC Irvine's Bren  Center, are sarod master Ali Akbar Khan, the David Hykes Harmonic Choir, the  Dimitri Pokrovsky Ensemble from the Soviet Union, and the Tsukusuma Noh Troupe  from Japan.  </P> <P> Poets Robert Bly and Alan Ginsberg also will give readings, but not of their  own poetry. Jue said that they will read "literature of various sacred  traditions."  </P> <P> According to Jue, the arts became a very important component in planning of the  conference.  </P> <P> "We wanted very much to communicate some of the concepts in a different,  non-cognitive way -- ideas such as peace, harmony and compassion. Some of these  religious ideas are difficult to communicate on a cognitive level.  </P> <P> "Music is a wonderful metaphor of harmony, for instance. People playing diverse  instruments get together and play together. That's how the music series began:  Let's look at music as a metaphor for harmony.  </P> <P> "But since we were also trying to go back to the various mythical traditions of  the various religions, we felt that in order to communicate the essence of some  of the teachings, we needed to look at music.  </P> <P> "If you look at all spiritual traditions, you will find that music and sound  have been tremendously important. Not only do many religions have an oral  tradition, but many times they communicate the spiritual through music and  movement."  </P> <P> Some groups were picked, according to Jue, because they "blended East and  West."  </P> <P> The Hykes Harmonic Choir combines Tibetan overtone chanting and medieval  Western melodic material. The Pokrovsky Ensemble blends Russian folk song and  liturgical traditions.  </P> <P> Other participants were chosen because of a particularly illuminating aspect of  the art form.  </P> <P> "One of the things in Japanese music is the use of pauses and different  instruments to symbolize different states of mind," he said. "That gives an  idea of how to communicate a certain concept through music."  </P> <P> Jue is sensitive that some people would describe all this as "touchy-feely" pop  psychology. He recoils from the term "new age."  </P> <P> "I don't even know what (new age) means," Jue said. "We have never thought of  doing it along that genre. If you look at the (daytime) program, you'll see  that we really wanted to look at people who have contributed to the field, who  have some history, who really have written and presented those ideas for a long  time. We were not developing a fad presentation."  </P> <P> The schedule of "Sacred Voices, Sacred Sounds" at UCI's Bren Center:  </P> <P> * Monday, 8 p.m.: Sarod player Ali Akbar Khan, flutist Pt. Hariprasad  Chaurasia, tabla player Swapan Chaudhuri.

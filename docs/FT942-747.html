			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Cementing the evidence of housing recovery: Brick shortages are building up for the first time for six years Brick shortages have begun to emerge in Britain for the first time for six years as the housing market continues its faltering recovery. Butterley, one of the country's biggest manufacturers of house bricks, was yesterday quoting 20 weeks' delivery to builders phoning its Kirton works in Nottinghamshire. This time last year builders contacting Kirton could expect deliveries the following day. In spite of the shortage of house bricks, the industry still has large stockpiles of higher-specification bricks used for offices, shops and public buildings such as hospitals and schools. Prices of house bricks have risen, but manufacturers say they have not yet moved far enough to encourage them to reopen kilns mothballed during the recession. There are also doubts about the pace and strength of the recovery in the housing market which has had a setback following recent rises in taxes and fixed-interest-rate mortgages. So far this has not reduced demand for bricks from housebuilders. They have increased land purchases and building programmes significantly in expectation of better times. During the first four months of this year builders started work on 11 per cent more private homes than during the corresponding period last year. Mr Richard Manning, managing director of the brick division of Hanson, the conglomerate which owns Butterley and London Brick, the country's biggest brick manufacturer, said: 'It is not clear the extent to which companies may be building homes for stock to carry them through the winter. Demand could fall just as we had reopened housing brick capacity.' The absence of an outcry from builders about the length of delivery delays - last encountered at the height of the late-1980s building boom - suggests that supply is more than enough to meet prevailing demand. The rise in sales has led to an increase of about a fifth in the average ex-factory price of housing bricks from a low of about Pounds 100 a thousand in autumn 1992 to about Pounds 120 now. Margins, however, are only just approaching the minimum 20 per cent needed to justify capital investment, Mr Manning said. Manufacturers are thought to have achieved returns of about 50 per cent when house brick prices peaked at about Pounds 160 a thousand during the late 1980s. Prices of higher-specification commercial bricks, which have fallen by about a fifth since the peak, have still to recover. Low demand from commercial and industrial developers, which previously accounted for more than half of all brick sales, means that the industry continues to suffer from over-capacity in spite of higher sales to housebuilders and a stream of plant and kiln closures. Between 1987 and 1989, manufacturers in Britain spent Pounds 200m increasing their capacity from 4.5bn bricks a year to 5bn. Since then, permanent and temporary closures have reduced capacity to 3.45bn. Actual production last year was 2.64bn. Total sales by the industry declined by a third from 4.7bn in 1987 to 3.13bn last year according to the Brick Development Association. Closures meant that the number of workers employed by brick manufacturers fell by almost 40 per cent from 14,000 to 8,500 between December 1987 and December 1993. Predatory pricing, with too much capacity still chasing too few sales, has inhibited price recovery according to Hanson, which believes further rationalisation is needed in the industry following a stream of mergers and acquisitions in the 1980s and early 1990s. Marshalls, a brick and concrete products manufacturer, says some companies over-traded at uneconomic prices in an effort to increase sales. This was adding to shortages and, in the long term, would increase pressure for higher prices as other brick producers sought to fill the gap. The two largest companies in the sector are Hanson and Redland. Hanson controls a third of British brick sales through London Brick (20 per cent) and Butterley (13 per cent). Redland, which acquired Steetley's brick operations two years ago, has about 19 per cent of the market. The next-largest is Ibstock, with a market share of just over 10 per cent. Tarmac, which last year swapped its clay tile business for Marley's brick operations, is estimated to have under just 10 per cent. About 50 medium and small producers share out the rest. The recession in commercial building means that the industry still holds a stock of 900m unsold bricks - enough to build another Great Wall, 6ft high, for 5,300 miles from London to Beijing. Life may be a little easier for brick manufacturers, which at the end of 1992 had unsold stock of 1.5bn, but recovery still has a way to go.</p>

			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT SEEKS TO DOWNPLAY ABORTION ISSUE  </P> <P> On the morning of an election day in which Republicans suffered losses in large  part because of the party's anti-abortion stance, President Bush tried to  distance the GOP from the issue.  </P> <P> "We have room in our party for people that feel one way, pro-life or  pro-choice. The Democratic Party is the same way," Bush said in his press  conference Tuesday.  </P> <P> Bush made clear that he will not back off his own anti-abortion position. But  he also made clear that he will not harden his views, praising family planning  programs, for example, which have been a major target of many anti-abortion  activists.  </P> <P> "I think everyone knows that this is an issue that divides," Bush said of  abortion. "Is it the most important issue for me? Absolutely not."  </P> <P> Abortion has been a key issue for Democrats over the last several months, and  the White House has been looking for a way to calm the fears of moderate  abortion-rights advocates within the GOP without upsetting the anti-abortion  conservatives whose support Bush needs. Bush appears to have decided that  downplaying the issue is his best hope.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Bush also displayed the strategy his advisers hope to use to diffuse  conservative concern on another issue -- defense spending. The Pentagon faces  some $12.9 billion in spending cuts this year under the Gramm-Rudman budget  balancing law, and at least some conservatives are alarmed that after eight  years of the Ronald Reagan Administration's resisting military spending cuts,  Bush's acquiescence in the current round of reductions will set a bad  precedent.  </P> <P> Bush's apparent defense is to blame the problem on Congress.  </P> <P> "I have no choice" but to allow the cuts to go forward, Bush said. Congress, he  charged, has failed to send him a deficit-cutting measure that would avoid the  defense spending cuts.  </P> <P> However, the Administration does have a choice, and it has been the subject of  heated internal debate.  </P> <P> Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and several other Cabinet officials have urged  Bush to reach an agreement with Congress on a deficit-reduction bill, thereby  allowing the automatic cuts to be rescinded. The automatic cuts took effect  earlier this fall after the Administration and Congress failed to agree on a  deficit-reduction package in time to meet the deadline in the Gramm-Rudman law.  </P> <P> But Budget Director Richard G. Darman has pushed Bush to keep the automatic  cuts and avoid a deal with Congress. Darman fears any bill that passes Congress  would be loaded down with budget gimmicks that would not, in fact, reduce the  deficit.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Bush said he would sign a deficit-cutting bill, but only if  Congress meets a series of requirements that seem unlikely.  </P> <P> Bush adopted the classic strategy of a President riding high in the polls --  distancing himself from controversies by blaming Congress and downplaying his  own influence.  </P> <P> Asked, for example, what he could do to move his Administration's initiatives  through Congress, Bush said: "Exhort, what else can I do? Veto and exhort."  </P> <P> "They've got the votes up there," he said, referring to Congress' Democratic  majority. "Look, I'm a realist."  </P> <P> Bush took a similar position when asked about the negative campaigning that has  marked the current round of election contests. "I think everybody would prefer  the positives," he said. "But I'm not sure there's much a President can do  about it."  </P> <P> The recent emphasis on abortion has been more of a concern to the White House  than the negativism of campaign advertisements. Until recently, Republican  politicians had assumed abortion would almost never be a major issue in  political campaigns against the Democrats. Anti-abortion activists were  powerful within the GOP, often influencing primary contests, but the abortion  rights side was poorly organized and unable to exert pressure during general  elections.  </P> <P> That situation changed radically in July when the Supreme Court opened the way  for greater state regulation of abortions. The decision galvanized the abortion  rights side of the debate and led to what political consultants say is one of  the fastest political turnarounds in U.S. history.  </P> <P> That turnaround was dramatically in evidence Tuesday. Abortion was the chief  issue in the two elections for governor, in Virginia and New Jersey, where the  Democratic candidates support abortion rights.  </P> <P> Democratic Rep. James J. Florio easily defeated Republican Rep. Jim Courter to  become governor of New Jersey and Democrat L. Douglas Wilder was maintaining a  narrow lead over Republican J. Marshall Coleman in Virginia.  </P> <P> Many Republicans, concerned for weeks about polls showing their candidates  being badly hurt by the abortion issue, have been hoping to reduce its  prominence. But Bush has been unwilling to move away from his hard-line  anti-abortion stand and has attracted attention to the issue twice this fall  with controversial vetoes of major government money bills that contain  abortion-related provisions.  </P> <P> Despite his evident desire to quiet the issue, the President made clear Tuesday  that he would continue that veto strategy, repeating a threat to veto yet a  third money bill later this fall because of abortion. The latest veto threat  involves the foreign aid bill, which contains money for international family  planning programs. Abortion opponents say the money might be used to aid  China's family planning program, which has been accused of including forced  abortions.  </P> <P> Supporters of the bill argue it contains adequate safeguards to keep U.S. money  from being misused in the Chinese program, but Bush made clear he did not agree  and would veto the bill.  </P> <P> Despite the pressure from GOP moderates, Bush advisers have warned him against  altering his position on abortion. Conservatives and abortion opponents  mistrust him already, they warn, because he used to support abortion rights.  Any sign of wavering now could lead to fierce attacks from the right, Bush  aides fear.  </P> <P> Bush favored abortion rights until 1980, when he became Ronald Reagan's running  mate. In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, published in March, 1980,  Bush contrasted himself with Reagan: "He (Reagan) opposes me for not wanting to  amend the Supreme Court decision on abortion: I happen to think it (Roe vs.  Wade) was right," Bush said.  </P> <P> During the 1988 campaign, he said: "I support a constitutional amendment that  would reverse the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision. I also support a human  life amendment (that would ban all abortions) with an exception for the life of  the mother, rape or incest."  </P></p>

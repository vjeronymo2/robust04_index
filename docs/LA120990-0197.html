			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK DAVAN MAHARAJ: COMPASSION SPRINGS FROM THE PLIGHT OF CANCER  VICTIM  </P> <P> Linda Fisher has bought all her Christmas presents, distributed her belongings  among her friends and relatives, and is waiting to die.  </P> <P> Fisher is the 41-year-old amputee and terminally ill cancer victim who sparked  a small controversy because she was living in a recreational vehicle parked in  front of her cousin's home in San Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> After interviewing Fisher in August, I knocked on her neighbors' doors to find  out exactly who had filed the complaint with the city. At one home, an elderly  woman opened the door a crack.  </P> <P> She said that she and her husband were concerned that Fisher was turning the  neighborhood into an RV park and that it could lower the value of their  $400,000 home. She and her husband had complained to the city's planning  division that Fisher was violating the city's land-use ordinance that prohibits  people from living in recreational vehicles in a residential area.  </P> <P> I had wondered why anyone would file such a complaint. They probably didn't  know that Fisher had been through seven major operations and had lost about 140  pounds during an 18-month period. Maybe they didn't know why she lives in the  RV. Maybe they didn't know that Fisher is almost always attached to an IV pump  and that her intestinal contents are discharged in a plastic bag. In the RV,  she can still get to the refrigerator or go to the bathroom unassisted.  </P> <P> The RV is not only her home -- it is her world.  </P> <P> The city had given Fisher notice that she had to find another home.  </P> <P> After an article about Fisher's situation was published, the city granted her a  three-month reprieve.  </P> <P> I have periodically telephoned Fisher to inquire how she is and to find out  whether she had received any word from the city. When I called last week, she  had good news and bad.  </P> <P> The city had granted her another six-month extension to live in her RV. And her  relatives from across the country had also pooled $10,000 to move the RV out of  the neighbors' sight. A contractor is making the renovations to accommodate the  RV on the side of the house.  </P> <P> But Fisher's doctors have told her that her kidneys and liver have been  irreparably damaged and that she was living "minute to minute."  </P> <P> After hearing the news, Fisher began taking care of business. The Christmas  presents she purchased included deer statues for her cousin Jean Maxey -- a  retired nurse who has been caring for her the last three years -- and a home  spa unit for her 83-year-old grandmother, Mae, who suffers from a bad back. She  also gave some of her belongings to a nurses' aide whose home was recently  destroyed in a fire.  </P> <P> Fisher said the RV incident had mentally drained her but quickly added that she  preferred to look on the brighter side.  </P> <P> She referred to Caren Chatham-Heller, a San Juan Capistrano woman who offered  her assistance after reading the newspaper article.  </P> <P> "I was moved . . . and I was angry," Chatham-Heller said. "I know how  uncommitted and uninvolved people are today, and I knew that the likelihood no  one else would offer to help her was high."  </P> <P> Chatham-Heller has since been in constant contact with Fisher. She has been  helpful in finding an additional nurse's aide to care for Fisher at night.  </P> <P> Although San Juan Capistrano's ordinance remains unchanged, in October, the  Placentia City Council amended its law that prohibited people from living in  recreation vehicles. Under the new law, the council may waive the requirements  "because the city recognizes that at times a person cannot comply with this  regulation due to extenuating circumstances."  </P> <P> Councilman Norman Z. Eckenrode, who proposed the amendment, said Fisher's story  changed his mind about Placentia's land-use law.  </P> <P> "We were moved by this woman's plight," Eckenrode said last week. "So we  decided to tell our staff not to be hard-nosed about this. There are times when  you have to have humanity or compassion and look the other way."  </P> <P> I felt sad about Fisher's condition. But when I finally worked up the courage  to ask her how she felt being so close to death, her answer made my sadness  less painful.  </P> <P> "If it wasn't my turn, I wouldn't be dying," she said. "He must have a reason  for me still being here. It took a lot of hard fighting, and I have never given  in. So if (my story) will help people in Placentia, then it was a good reason  to be around."  </P></p>

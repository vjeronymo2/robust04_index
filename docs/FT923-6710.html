			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Abbey to be luxury hotel COOMBE Abbey, a Midlands landmark outside Coventry since the Cistercians established a monastery there in 1150, is to be restored as a luxury hotel. The Pounds 14.4m private and public-sector development will include a country park and golf course. Coventry City Council, the landowner, announced yesterday that it had reached agreement with Lumley Castle, the Durham hotelier, Try Construction and Allied Irish Banks on a financial package arranged by Price Waterhouse Corporate Finance. Work on the project should start next month. Coombe Abbey is a grade I listed building that has fallen into dilapidation. The last significant works on the site were undertaken in the mid-19th century. The city council, which faces cutbacks, does not have the resources to maintain it. The venture emphasises the growing readiness of Labour-controlled councils to work with the private sector on economic development. The process has been hastened by the government's constraints on council spending. The city council contribution to the Coombe Abbey project is worth Pounds 4.6m. This comprises the land and grants arranged by the council, including one of Pounds 977,000 from the European Community. The majority equity holder will be Lumley Castle. Mr Gordon Bear, who owns Lumley Castle and will run the hotel, has a personal stake of Pounds 250,000 in the project. The main development will be financed by borrowings of Pounds 8.5m from Allied Irish Banks. Try Construction will have Pounds 1m of equity. The first stage of the development will provide a visitor centre and other public facilities for a country park. The second stage will transform the buildings into a 49-bed hotel. This is smaller than was first envisaged - earlier this year the hope was for a Pounds 20m project, partly funded by China Construction International, a Chinese government company. However, the Chinese interest evaporated.</p>

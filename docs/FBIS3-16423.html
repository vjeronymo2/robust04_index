There has been the Ames espionage "affair," the embarrassment  over the Moscow visit of ex-President Nixon, Washington's  emissary, and the different readings of ways to settle the  Bosnian crisis. Let us add to this the tragedy in the Arab  mosque in Hebron, which interrupted the process which had begun  of settling the Arab-Israeli conflict; the problems of the  Russian-speaking population in the Baltic countries....    As we see, there are quite a few topics to analyze.  Therefore the latest meeting between the heads of the Russian  and U.S. foreign policy departments, which took place in  Vladivostok yesterday, resembled the work of restorers filling  cracks in the walls of an ancient building. International  problems were also discussed in passing. Particularly as Andrey  Kozyrev has just visited the Near East, where he held talks with  the leaders of Israel and the PLO, while Warren Christopher has  visited a number of countries in the Asia and Pacific region.    At Vnukovo Airport, from where the head of the Russian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs flew to Vladivostok, Andrey Kozyrev  remarked in conversation with journalists that there are certain  circles both in the United States and in Russia which dislike  cooperation between the two countries, particularly when it  takes on a strategic nature. Nevertheless, the minister  believes that Russian-U.S. relations will continue to be based  on the principles of the Moscow Declaration. "It is a  strategic, mature partnership, indications of which are a  commonality of interests and a close level of contacts," he  emphasized.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The validity of vouchers will not be prolonged after  June 30 and President Yeltsin may sign a decree on post-voucher  privatization soon, Vice-Premier, Chairman of the RF State  Property Committee Anatoliy Chubays said.    Interviewed by the Financial Information Agency on  Wednesday,  Chubays said that the program for post-voucher privatization  approved by the government was to be submitted to President  Yeltsin for signature no later than June 25.    Chubays said that the bulk of funds (51 percent) raised by  the post-voucher privatization beginning on July 1 would be left  to the enterprises.    About the mechanism of post-voucher privatization  Vice-Premier said that simultaneously with the presidential  decree effecting it the program would be presented to the State  Duma for consideration.    Chubays said that discounts to staffs were one of the key  features of monetary privatization.    Two types of discounts are planned. Under one option the  employees will receive no more than 25 percent of privileged  shares giving no right to vote free. Under the other the  employees will be able to buy out 10 percent of simple (voting)  actions at a 30 percent discount. The starting price of shares  is expected to grow 600 to 700 percent, because the assets will  be evaluated in January 1, 1994 prices.</p>

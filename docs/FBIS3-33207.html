This agreement is  the first step to renew foreign debt renegotiations.    "We already have the backing for our economic program,"  Central Bank President Augusto de la Torre said after concluding  his Washington meetings with the IMF, the World Bank, and the  Inter-American Development Bank.    An IMF delegation will visit Quito in March, and it has not  been ruled out that at the end of the Quito meetings the  respective letter of intent and a biannual "standby" [preceding  word in English] agreement could be signed. This agreement would  allow the government to renew negotiations on the commercial  portion of its foreign debt. Both the renegotiation as well as  the service of this $6.5 billion portion have been suspended  since August 1992, when the liberal government of Sixto  Duran-Ballen took office.    The total Ecuadoran debt, according to the latest official  reports, amounts to $12.6 billion.    The letter of intent will include the Ecuadoran pledge to  continue its structural reform programs with a government  reduction, a public spending reduction, and greater reduction of  the inflation rate that is currently at 29 percent a year.    Nevertheless, the constitutionality of the fuel increase, in  effect since 29 January, is the subject of an appeal before the  Supreme Court of Justice which could suspend the increase.  According to the government that "would topple the whole  economic program."</p>

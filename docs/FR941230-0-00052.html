			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background and Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The City of Chesapeake, Virginia has requested that openings of the Gilmerton Highway drawbridge across the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River, Atlantic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Intracoastal Waterway, mile 5.8, at Chesapeake, Virginia, be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited during the morning and evening rush hours. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would help reduce highway traffic congestion problems and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address public safety and welfare concerns associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequent bridge openings caused by recreational and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial boat traffic. The City of Chesapeake's request  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is based on the increase in highway traffic crossing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gilmerton Bridge occurring as a result of the emergency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closing to highway traffic of the Jordan Bridge located  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> downriver at mile 2.8. When the Jordan Bridge experienced a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sudden mechanical malfunction on May 10, 1994, this vertical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lift bridge was raised to the fully opened to river traffic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> position in order not to block use of the waterway by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heavy commercial and recreational traffic routinely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transitting the Intracoastal Waterway. As a result of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> locking the bridge in the open position until further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice, the highway traffic that had been using the Jordan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bridge was diverted to the Gilmerton Bridge. The increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in highway congestion and lengthy delays across the bridge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> caused by the Jordan Bridge's closure, coupled with random,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-scheduled drawbridge openings for the many commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and recreational vessels using the Intracoastal Waterway  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this area warrants the need to change the operating schedule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for this bridge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, the drawbridge opens on demand, 24-hours a day, seven-days a week. This rule will limit bridge openings between the hours of 6:30 a.m. to 8 a.m. and from 3:30 p.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. Commercial cargo vessels, tugs, and tugs with tows will be allowed passage through the bridge during the morning and evening rush hours, provided a 2-hour advance notice is given to the Gilmerton Bridge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public vessels of the United States, vessels in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distress, commercial vessels carrying liquefied flammable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas or other harmful substances, and commercial or public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessels assisting in an emergency situation will be allowed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> passage through the bridge at any time. Recreational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessels and all other commercial vessels will not be allowed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> passage through the bridge during the morning and evening  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rush hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The decision to allow liquefied flammable gas carriers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> access through the bridge at any time with no restrictions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was made based on the hazards involved in shipping liquefied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flammable gas and to maintain safety along the Southern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Branch of the Elizabeth River. It has been determined by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Coast Guard that since tugs and tugs with tows have no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> place to tie up in the proximity of the bridge to wait for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bridge opening, it was necessary to include them in the 2-hour  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advance notice requirement provision. Commercial cargo  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessels, requiring high tide to transit this river also are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the 2-hour advance notice requirement provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Gilmerton Bridge is a vital link between the cities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Portsmouth and Chesapeake used widely by motorists that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> work at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, other Federal agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> located within the Shipyard, as well as within Portsmouth,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and other industries and businesses in Portsmouth and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chesapeake, Virginia. It appears the need to limit bridge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> openings during peak rush hours far outweighs any need to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintain the Gilmerton Bridge at its present ``open on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demand'' schedule. On November 2, 1994, the Coast Guard met  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the Hampton Roads Maritime Association to discuss  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changing the regulations on the Gilmerton Bridge and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasons why restricting this bridge during the morning and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evening rush hours was necessary. The Hampton Roads  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Maritime Association considered the current condition of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Jordan Bridge and they supported the plan to regulate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gilmerton Bridge to accommodate the additional vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> traffic being diverted from the Jordan Bridge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

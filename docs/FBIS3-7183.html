			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 25 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii on Friday ruled out any pledge to repeat this year's tax  cuts in a package of market-opening measures to be announced  next week.    Despite suggestions in the government that a renewal of the  6  trillion yen cuts in income tax and resident's tax be written  into the package due by month's end, Fujii told a regular press  conference after a morning cabinet meeting that he "can't  imagine" including further cuts without specific financing.    He repeated that the ruling parties have vowed to enact  permanent tax reform by year's end, saying it is now under  "serious debate." The tax overhaul is expected to cut income  taxes and raise such indirect levies as the consumption tax.    Fujii declined comment on a reported basic agreement by the  ruling coalition and opposition parties to spell out the  extension of the tax cuts as an addendum to a tax revision  package now under deliberation in the Diet.    He said the coalition and opposition parties "are still in  the stage of discussing" the idea.    Fujii said there is little time to include new items in the  package due out next Tuesday. But he said "things are moving  and may change," suggesting that new macroeconomic measures  could be included later.    He said he did not discuss macroeconomic measures when he  met  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura on Thursday.    But Takemura, the chief government spokesman, told a  separate  press meeting Thursday that while he wants to show the  "direction" of government policy on tax cuts and other  macroeconomic measures in the March package, details would take  until June to work out.    Takemura also said he "fully recognized" the Finance  Ministry's "unchanged" stance.    In Friday morning's press meeting, Fujii said the  government's policy on the package remains unchanged to "take  voluntary actions on four items and in three priority areas" in  the Japan-U.S. framework talks.    U.S. officials have said that a single-year tax cut is  insufficient to spur domestic demand and help cut Japan's trade  surplus, and have called for additional macroeconomic measures.    They have also said the U.S. will assess the possibility of  resuming the stalled framework talks based on Japan's March  package.    Fujii said macroeconomic measures should be taken  "voluntarily" and not as an international promise, and that this  point had been agreed by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and  President Bill Clinton at their meeting in February.    Asked about the effect of planned utilities rate hikes,  Fujii  said they would not offset the benefits of the tax cuts, noting  that the planned hikes were assumed in the government's economic  forecast for fiscal 1994.</p>

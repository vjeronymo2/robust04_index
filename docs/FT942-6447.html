			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / UK group abandons Pounds 400m US purchase The steep slide in share prices on the London stockmarket in recent weeks has forced FKI, the Halifax-based electrical engineering and electronic components group, to abandon a Pounds 400m US acquisition. FKI has been involved in discussions with its target, thought to have been a bulk handling systems manufacturer, since the start of the year and agreed a purchase price, only to see its ability to fund the deal whittled away by the slide in its shares. Rumours of a possible rights issue from FKI, to fund a big international acquisition, have been circulating in the London stockmarket since the turn of the year when Kleinwort Benson Securities was appointed as the company's stockbroker, succeeding Panmure Gordon. FKI was demerged from FKI Babcock in 1989. The company's financial adviser is NM Rothschild. FKI sought to finance the deal via a rights issue but dropped its plan at the last minute because of worries that shareholders might balk at an issue in current volatile market conditions. The rights issue would have had to have been priced at a deep discount to FKI's share price which has fallen 15 per cent to 180p since hitting an all-time high of 212p on March 21. Over the same period the FT-SE Actuaries All-Share index has dropped 7.1 per cent and the FT-SE Actuaries Engineering sub-sector by 6.8 per cent. The abandonment of the US deal is seen as a blow to FKI's strategy but the company is thought to be still seeking further acquisitions, albeit of a smaller size. FKI's last purchase was in the US in November last year when it acquired the Truth hardware business from SPX Corporation for Pounds 68m. The company is scheduled to announce preliminary results on June 16. Analysts' estimates of pre-tax profits for the year to end-March range from Pounds 50m up to Pounds 53m. Kleinwort Benson, the company's broker, expects it to achieve profits of Pounds 52.5m. The dividend total is forecast to rise more than 20 per cent to a consensus figure of 3.7p. Mr Jeff Whalley, FKI's chairman, was on holiday in France yesterday and unavailable for comment. Mr Bob Beeston, FKI's chief executive, was on holiday in Devon.</p>

			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FBI IN PHOENIX JOINS PROBE OF LINCOLN S &amp; L  </P> <P> The FBI office in Phoenix has decided to open a preliminary inquiry into the  affairs of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan and its parent firm, American Continental  Corp., the special agent in charge of the office said Friday.  </P> <P> Arizona agents will coordinate their inquiry with a federal grand jury and the  FBI office in Los Angeles, where a criminal investigation already has been  launched, Special Agent Herb Hawkins said in Phoenix.  </P> <P> Hawkins said a preliminary inquiry is a routine step "to determine if further  facts warrant a more detailed investigation" of Lincoln or American  Continental, which filed for bankruptcy on April 13. Lincoln, an Irvine thrift  with major operations in Arizona, was seized by federal regulators the next  day.  </P> <P> A. Melvin McDonald, a Phoenix lawyer representing American Continental, said  the Phoenix FBI office has asked for a list of corporate bondholders. About  22,000 investors bought around $200 million in bonds through Lincoln's 29  branches in Southern California. Those bonds now are nearly worthless, and the  bondholders are near the bottom of the list of American Continental creditors  who hope to recover funds from U.S. Bankruptcy Court proceedings.  </P> <P> American Continental denies any wrongdoing and welcomes the FBI inquiry,  McDonald said.  </P> <P> The Federal Home Loan Bank Board has asked for a criminal investigation into  allegations that American Continental officials illegally profited from their  operation of Lincoln. A federal official has said the alleged misdeeds include  improper insider loans, fraudulent land sales and manipulation of stock prices.  </P> <P> The Securities and Exchange Commission also has been investigating the company.  </P></p>

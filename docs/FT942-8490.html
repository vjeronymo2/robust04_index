			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Ashdown defends stance on currency It is in Britain's long-term economic interest to be part of a single European currency, Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said last night. Mr Ashdown used a speech to the cross-party European Policy Forum in London to outline his party's stance on a range of European issues, including defence and economic integration, before next month's European elections. On defence, Mr Ashdown called for British resources to be pooled with other European Union member states. He said a common EU defence policy would produce better value for money and a more effective response to conflicts such as the one in Bosnia. But he said this did not mean that British troops should be sent to battle without the consent of the UK government.</p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FURNISHINGS;  </P> <P> CHINA'S A FINE WAY TO MAKE HOLIDAY DINNERS SPECIAL  </P> <P> A long time ago, way before those little perforated cartons of cereal were  invented, inhabitants of the civilized world sat down to their meals before  lace-encrusted tables and gorged themselves on joints of beef with utensils  made of silver.  </P> <P> And though paper plates, Styrofoam cups, and plastic knives and forks have  crept onto the American dining table like insects, silver is still with us.  It's in a drawer in the buffet cabinet, about to be dusted off and polished for  the holiday dinner party season.  </P> <P> But, except maybe at this time of year, nobody entertains at home any more.  It's easier to swallow the huge expense of reserving a table for 12 at a  restaurant and have the staff deal with the food and the formalities, and let  everyone (sometimes even the waiter) go home feeling gypped.  </P> <P> Chalk it up to the death of the servant class, or that women spend more time  running their careers and less time running around in the kitchen. In a perfect  world, their husbands would do that, but they'd still probably be left with the  job of selecting china patterns.  </P> <P> "People definitely judge a household by what they see when they sit down," says  Sarah Hanley, a manager at Villeroy and Boch whose South Coast Plaza outlet  specializes in fine china. "It's a presentation of the host's personality."  </P> <P> Hanley says setting a beautiful table doesn't have to be a lofty pursuit  limited to the pages of a Jane Austen novel or White House state dinners. By  shedding their grandmother's inhibitions, most people can manage to conjure the  proper ambience for about what it cost to feed those 12 hungry people. And  they'll score points for tradition.  </P> <P> Hanley's goal is to set free the average homemaker imprisoned by wedding gift  china so fancy she is terrified to use it.  </P> <P> "People tend to be ultra-conservative when they venture out to buy china and  silver for the first time. It doesn't have to be that way," she says. "And the  china you use doesn't have to be made of bone, and the silver can be stainless  steel."  </P> <P> Part of Hanley's job is to administer protocol to her customers at Villeroy and  Boch. There she finds herself carefully adopting the role of Miss Manners while  advising her customers on the correct number of forks to use for a three-course  meal as opposed to a five-course meal, and when and if finger bowls (a dying  icon, at best) are necessary. All of this in a world where slamming down a  hamburger while steering onto the San Diego Freeway is the accepted norm of  taking a meal.  </P> <P> Of course, the dinner party used to serve as the primary excuse for exhibiting  one's social status.  </P> <P> "Victorian women had over 1,800 pieces of silver on the table at one time,"  says Mary Reynolds, a sales associate at South Coast Plaza's exclusive sterling  and crystal store, Lucy Zahran Inc. Among them: a sterling lettuce fork for  serving individual pieces of lettuce; a sterling corn scraper; a special spoon  for pudding; an elongated spoon for reaching into canisters of horseradish --  maybe even a knife rest, "so they wouldn't always have to wash out those big  linens," Reynolds says.  </P> <P> But the rules for setting a table have changed somewhat to keep up with the  microwaveable social graces of the late 20th Century.  </P> <P> "The trend is toward more formal entertaining," says Helen Russell, manager at  the Lenox China Store in South Coast Plaza. "New tableware can be combined with  family heirlooms to create an understated elegance that is nostalgic in mood."  </P> <P> Hanley says you should start with the basics: white dinner plates are a good  background, to which can be added different patterns to suit different  occasions. Bone china is always the most formal, she says, but a good porcelain  is also a good bet. "And don't be afraid of trim," Hanley advises. "There's  nothing wrong with trim."  </P> <P> So if that sounds like a manageable pursuit, here are the five basic pieces  that Hanley says comprise the well-healed place setting: the basic dinner  plate, the salad plate, a teacup and saucer, a bread and butter dish and a soup  bowl that doubles as a cereal bowl.  </P> <P> Reynolds suggests these flatware complements: dinner forks, butter knives,  salad forks, soupspoons and teaspoons.  </P> <P> Extras may include open vegetable-salad bowls (Hanley suggests keeping at least  two on hand); a gravy boat (although gravy is a bit of a dinosaur in these  cholesterol-conscious times); an oval or round platter (for those big  productions, like the one you're contemplating for Christmas dinner); sandwich  trays (for buffets); and cake plates ("cakes look nicer on a pedestal"). There  are also butter dishes and margarine pots, egg cups, napkin rings, ad  infinitum.  </P> <P> And there are many choices when it comes to bowls. The basic soup (and cereal),  the rimmed soup bowl, the cream soup bowl, a bowl for fruit, custard, rice and  eggs. "Bowls can be very confusing," Hanley says.  </P> <P> Even if most of your dinnerware is made up of florals or some other bold  pattern, Hanley says pieces can always be added to change the look of your  table, to dress it up or down. By mixing and matching colors and patterns, the  dining table is never static, and, as the best chefs know, you'll never serve  the same dish twice.  </P> <P> "By the time you reach dessert, you'll have a whole new set," she says.  </P> <P> Jackie Kennedy knew this stuff. Once when entertaining at a state dinner given  at Mount Vernon in 1961 in honor of the president of Pakistan, she switched the  stiff white damask linen for pale yellows and blues. How nice for her guests,  who were charmed by the warmer tones and probably digested everything much more  peaceably.  </P> <P> "In today's fast-paced lifestyles, people treasure the moments they have to  just sit with friends and have a good dinner," Reynolds says. "We're all tired  of restaurants. The time we spend together is going to be quality time."  </P> <P> When shopping for place settings, Hanley suggests keeping in mind the following  rules of etiquette: the flatware is placed 1 inch from the edge of the table at  place settings that are equidistant from each other (about 30 inches between  centers of plates). The napkin may be placed on the plate, unless the first  course is in place, in which case it is to the left of the forks. There should  never be more than three utensils on each side of the plate, and always place  the utensil that is to be used first on the outside. "You should be able to  predict what the meal will be from your place setting," Hanley says.  </P> <P> The average cost for each place setting runs between $60 and $150 at Villeroy  and Boch (Hanley suggests buying service for eight,) and a five-piece set of  sterling silver flatware at Lucy Zahran ranges from $200 to $1,000. "Silver is  still the first thing a cat burglar goes for," Reynolds says, which would seem  to make a good case for stainless steel, available at housewares stores, such  as the Pottery Shack in Laguna Beach. They also sell less formal china,  stemware and napkins. A five-piece set of stainless runs from $20 to about $60.  </P> <P> "Most brides are doing silver-plated at around $175 for a five-piece set,"  Reynolds says. She adds that the high price of silver is based more on the  quality of workmanship involved than its market price.  </P> <P> "There are a limited amount of artisans -- most of them are old and there are  few young people coming in to replace them," she says. In a cabinet on the  shop's mezzanine, Reynolds points out a grouping of the French Christofle  silver-plated flatware, consisting of more than 50 different types of utensils,  including something called an ice cream knife. All of the forks are facing  down, a custom that is in sync with the European habit of eating with the fork  held in the left hand, tines pointing earthward.  </P> <P> "Europeans don't eat like we do," Reynolds says. "You can't shovel your food in  if you hold your fork that way. Try it."  </P> <P> A few more guidelines on choosing place settings:  </P> <P> * Be stylish and ephemeral; don't be afraid to mix and match patterns.  </P> <P> * Most spills occur because plates are too small. Hanley suggests using plates  18 inches in diameter.  </P> <P> * Paper napkins are an effrontery, especially indoors.  </P> <P> * White is always right. On the other hand, black is considered quite  sophisticated.  </P> <P> * Remember: crystal goes with everything. And some of it is even microwaveable.  </P></p>

			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Letter: Cable TV development restrained by old technology (2) Sir, I was pleased to read your comments ('Cable telecoms') and the sensible suggestions for overcoming the restrictions placed on BT. My telephone is connected to the BT network via copper wires. This is, as you have pointed out, obsolete technology and BT is prevented by government regulations from replacing this metal based network by fibre optics for its domestic customers. Thus, we are deprived of services which would otherwise be available. The fact that BT has this Luddite ball and chain clamped round its metaphorical leg only illustrates how daft British governments can get. These restrictions not only hold back the technical development of BT, but also manufacturing companies supplying equipment to BT. Once installed, fibre networks will be able to provide a great variety of information for the home consumer. However, to be successful this will have to be cheap, probably at a price comparable to the cost of television film channels. It will work if the price is right] Derek A Coggrave, 23, Wentworth Park, Finchley, London N3 1YE,</p>

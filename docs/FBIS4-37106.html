			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Abu-Sirhan: "In The Name Of God, The Merciful, </F> The Compassionate. As to the Thief, Male or Female, Cut Off His  or Her Hands, a Punishment by Way of Example, From God, for  Their Crime." (part of a Koranic verse)]    [Text] Revolution Command Council Decree No. 59 of 4 June  1994 is a sound one. Theft cannot be deemed an ordinary crime  when people are suffering under the circumstances of the  embargo, where people labor endlessly to make ends meet and  ensure themselves a decent livelihood. Under such  circumstances, when one loses some of his material possessions,  his budget is monstrously undermined.    This decree is directly connected with the principle of  imposing the rule of law. I previously wrote an article, hoping  that the decree we had to revoke prior to the onset of the  30-state aggression due to Western pressure over the issue of  human rights would be rehabilitated. This decree gave men the  right to kill their sisters, wives, etc., if they commit  adultery, or any other crimes of passion. The basic reasons for  cutting off thieves' hands are also found in the injunction that  calls for killing adulteresses.    In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. "The  woman and the man guilty of adultery or fornication, flog each  of them with a hundred stripes: Let not compassion move you in  their case, in a matter prescribed by God, if ye believe in God  and the Last Day." [Part of a Koranic verse]    This decree concerning adultery reflected our age-old Iraqi  family traditions, which make us as Iraqis stand out among our  brethren in the remaining Arab states.    In my opinion, the important thing is to see the competent  agencies stringently implement the decree pertaining to thieves.  This is necessary if that decree is to achieve its purposes and  sublime objectives. This is because the failure to do so will  cause immense damage and harm.    In the past, a decree providing for the execution of brothel  madams was issued. This decree was one of the greatest and most  profound ones, although it is hard to use the superlative case  in such situations.    Nonetheless, I would like to address the following question  to the competent agencies: How many brothel madams have been  executed so far?    We, as journalists and informed people, have not heard that  any single brothel madam has been executed, although there are  many of them around.</p>

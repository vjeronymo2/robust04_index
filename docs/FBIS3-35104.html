			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul has emphasized that  the problem with Israel is a political not a security one as  Israel claims.    He said: They ask us to halt the resistance so that the  Israeli army may live on our land, which is foolishness. Our  land is occupied and the resistance was not the cause of  occupation but rather a result.    He indicated that the army can ensure security in the south  and if Israel withdraws, the army can carry out security duties  efficiently.    On preparations to face any aggression, he said: We want to  keep the people steadfast. The resistance will not be touched  and the army is mobilized and completely ready to play its role  as it did in the Seven-Day War. These are the capabilities that  we will use and that we are not willing to surrender. We have  taken all precautions within our reach and will not give in. He  added: We are not willing to be defeated peacefully at the  negotiating table because we were not defeated militarily in the  war with Israel. Israel should make a decision on a  comprehensive, just peace and on the exchange of land for peace,  because occupation and peace cannot be combined.</p>

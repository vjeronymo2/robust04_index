			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEN JOHNSON KNOWS HOW HAWKINS FEELS;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: FORMER HOUSTON COLT .45 PITCHER RECALLS DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN HE NO-HIT  CINCINNATI IN 1964 AND LOST, 1-0.  </P> <P> Ken Johnson's phone started ringing Sunday evening.  </P> <P> "You're about the 10th call," he said from his home in Pineville, La., a small  town located in the center of the state on the Red River.  </P> <P> Johnson, 57, hasn't pitched in the big leagues since 1970, but he was suddenly  back in the spotlight, put there by the New York Yankees' Andy Hawkins.  </P> <P> Like Hawkins did Sunday, Johnson once lost a complete-game no-hitter.  </P> <P> Johnson, who pitched for seven teams during a 13-year career, was with the  Houston Colt .45s (later the Astros) when he no-hit the Cincinnati Reds on  April 23, 1964, at Houston and lost, 1-0.  </P> <P> It was pointed out to Johnson that in the 1965 edition of the Official Baseball  Guide, he is quoted as saying, "I'm not happy about losing the game, but I know  that if we'd won, people would have forgotten by next year that I'd pitched a  no-hitter. This way, they'll talk about it for maybe the next 20 or 30 years."  </P> <P> Johnson said that didn't come from him.  </P> <P> "Pete Runnels, our first baseman, came up with that," Johnson said. "I was very  disappointed to lose the game. They don't pay you to lose.  </P> <P> "It wasn't until a few years later that it set in that I had pitched a  no-hitter. I was proud to have pitched it.  </P> <P> "For a pitcher, a no-hitter is the ultimate."  </P> <P> Johnson's frustration at the time is understandable. His ninth-inning error  contributed to the loss.  </P> <P> With one out, Pete Rose bunted down the third-base line, and Johnson's throw to  first was wide, enabling Rose to go to second. He went to third on a groundout  and scored on an error by second baseman Nellie Fox.  </P> <P> "After the game, I saw Nellie sitting there with his head down and went over  and told him, 'Hey, it was my fault. It was my error that cost us the game.'  </P> <P> "Runnels overheard me, and that's when he pointed out that at least they'd be  talking about this for 20 or 30 years.  </P> <P> "It wasn't much consolation at the time."  </P> <P> Later, things were better.  </P> <P> Sandy Koufax and Jim Bunning also pitched no-hitters in 1964, Bunning pitching  a perfect game against the New York Mets. Johnson and those two were honored  for their no-hitters during a ceremony at the 1971 Hall of Fame inductions at  Cooperstown, N.Y.  </P> <P> "It was quite a thrill to be grouped with those two guys," Johnson said.  </P> <P> Johnson was 11-16 in 1964, but improved to 16-10 in 1965 after he was traded  early in the season to the Milwaukee Braves.  </P> <P> The Braves moved to Atlanta the next season, and Johnson had records of 14-8  and 13-9 before falling to 5-8 in the 1968.  </P> <P> His three-plus seasons with Houston were tough. "One year, I tied Don Drysdale  with a 2.65 earned-run average, about seventh in the league, and Drysdale wins  23 games and I win 11," Johnson said.  </P> <P> "They used to say, 'Poor ol' Ken Johnson, they never score any runs for him.' I  remember one game against the Phillies, they had a Runs for Johnson Night, and  any woman with a run in her stocking got in free."  </P> <P> After leaving baseball in 1970, Johnson returned to his hometown of West Palm  Beach, Fla.  </P> <P> Then in 1980, he and wife Lynn moved to Pineville, where Johnson got a job at  Louisiana College, a liberal arts NAIA school of about 1,000 students.  </P> <P> Johnson was hired as the assistant baseball coach, and also given a  fund-raising job and put in charge of the men's dorm.  </P> <P> He's semi-retired now, keeping only the coaching job.  </P> <P> Johnson was familiar with Louisiana College because sons Ken Jr. and Russell  and daughter Janet all went there.  </P> <P> "I would visit every year, especially when both my sons were playing college  ball," he said. "I used to tell 'em back in West Palm Beach that I was taking  off for the spring, and I'd go out there and live in a dorm."  </P> <P> He got to know the baseball coach, Billy Algood, who was also the athletic  director and basketball coach.  </P> <P> "During one of my visits, I kind of asked him if he needed any help, and he  said yes," Johnson said.  </P> <P> It's been a peaceful life. Johnson said he spends most of his time fishing.  </P> <P> But things got a little more exciting on Sunday when the phone started ringing,  and Johnson seemed to enjoy the attention.  </P> <P> "Thanks for calling," he said.  </P></p>

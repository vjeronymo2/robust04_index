			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 16 April (MTI) -- "The Free Democrats'  electoral manifesto will bring a turnabout as compared to what  happened in Hungary in the past four years and how it happened,"  Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) Chairman Ivan Peto told a  rally in Budapest today.    "It will also bring a turnabout as compared to the preceding  forty years, the underlying cause of economic decline and social  disintegration in the past four years," he said.    The chairman of Hungary's biggest opposition party addressed  a celebration, marking the fifth anniversary of the approval of  the "The Program of Transforming the Regime", the first party  manifesto on democratic transition, a document which later  became known as the "Blue Book".    On this occasion, the Free Democrats came forward with an  electoral manifesto entitled "Turnabout, Stability, and Growth".    The Free Democrats intend to become determining factors in  the new government which will dismiss the current coalition,  Peto said.    The SZDSZ will only form a coalition with any party if it  becomes authorized by its membership at a delegates' assembly  after the elections, he said.    "The main question of the elections is whether the  government  to follow the present coalition will be led by liberals or  socialists," the SZDSZ chairman said.</p>

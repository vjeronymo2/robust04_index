			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo poised The Enterprise Oil bid for Lasmo entered a crucial phase as the market braced itself for Lasmo's final defence document, expected possibly today, which will include a net asset valuation by independent oil consultants DeGolyer and MacNaughtoin. Dealers said the market indicated Enterprise's bid would fail, hence the rise in Enterprise shares, which rallied 12 to 391p on keen turnover of 1m. Lasmo, meanwhile, hardened 1 1/2 to 137p with turnover increasing significantly to reach 5.5m shares. The latest fall in crude oil prices, to below the Dollars 16 a barrel mark, unsettled the oil sector, where British Petroleum slipped 3 to 377p in heavy turnover of 9.4m shares and Shell Transport eased a penny to 698p on 4.9m traded. Oil analysts were not unduly bearish of the oil sector. 'Most of the downside pressure has already been exerted,' commented one. Standard Chartered continued to outpace the rest of the banks sector, with the market chasing the shares higher again ahead of a series of US presentations from Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank. At the close Standard shares were 9 higher at 271p after exceptionally heavy volume of 7.7m. News from the court hearing on the Lloyds Bank merger with the Cheltenham &amp; Glouc-ester Building Society was not known during market hours. Lloyds ended 7 firmer at 571p, with marketmakers saying a rejection of the proposed merger could lead to severe downside pressure on Lloyds shares. Abbey National, up 11 at 428p at the close and whose shares were badly affected by the Lloyds/C&amp;G merger prosposals as the market focused on increased competition in the mortgage market, was expected to rise sharply in the event that the merger was blocked. TSB advanced 9 to 219p as a number of short market positions were squeezed. Preliminary figures from Hambros, the merchant bank, were initially well received and in line with market forecasts but Hambros shares, which touched 317p immediately following the results, subsequently dipped to close 8 down at 305p as institutions switched into SG Warburg. The latter raced up 14 to 729p. Kleinwort Benson shares were unaffected and edged up 3 to 458p. London International Group fell 8 1/2 to 90 1/2 p as the company announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 174.9m and a one-for-one rights issue. The rights issue, which is at a price of 70p, had been well-flagged and the market had been braced for the figures. Although the share price receded there was some optimism surrounding the stock, sparked by the belief that the company was finally putting its troubles behind it and had turned a corner. 'There are good prospects for recovery; there is the feeling that this year has been a watershed for LIG,' said Mr Nigel Barnes at Hoare Govett. Turnover was above average at 2.5m shares. A settlement of Pounds 115m in the proceedings brought by helicopter group Westland against the Arab Organisation for Industrialisation in France helped Westland's parent GKN rise 12 to 603p. Volume in the stock - which is to be included in the FT-SE 100 as a replacement for Tarmac - was 2.4m. Results in line with market expectations saw Northern Foods gain 4 at 212p. Pre-tax profits for the year ended March 31 increased to Pounds 157.2m, compared with Pounds 153.2m a year ago. Food manufacturing analysts downgraded their forecasts for the current year, mainly because of restructuring provisions. Dealers said BZW had joined Strauss and Warburg in recommending Cadbury Schweppes, which scored a sharp rise of 15 to 472p on turnover of 2.6m. There was improved business in the food retailers, with J. Sainsbury rising 9 to 393p on 4m traded, still boosted by the Yamaichi recommendation, and Argyll ahead 3 at 236p on 5m. Kwik Save climbed 12 to 554p and Iceland rose 5 to 143p. The stores sector was largely subdued, with dealers reporting little buying activity. However, MFI, the furniture group, was helped by a UBS buy recommendation, gaining 2 at 158p. Boots was said to have been given a push by Smith New Court, the stock moving ahead 10 to 533p. WH Smith saw its recent run come to an end as the 'A' shares drifted back 3 to 494p. Similarly, Kingfisher's recent bounce lost momentum and the stock retreated 2 to 528p. A recommended offer for Chiltern Radio, at 242p a share, sent the stock leaping 33 to 238p. Metro Radio, up 11 at 374p, and Scottish, ahead 20 at 585p, also excited interest. Property company Argent Group made a successful market debut, being placed at 255p and ending the day at 266p. A top of the range dividend from Meyer International saw the timber group's shares advance 18 to 453p. Amec was 6 firmer at 116p after the optimistic comments at the annual meeting. A presentation by Guinness, said to be with James Capel, helped the shares appreciate 9 to 477p. Amersham, the chemicals group, continued to reflect the excellent figures released on Tuesday and subsequent profits upgrades, the shares closing 17 higher at 988p. Shareholders at the Euro Disney agm were told that its FFr6bn rights issue would be priced at around FFr10 per share and would be launched shortly. The stock slid 10 to 405p. The company also cautioned that attendances for the second half of this year could be lower than the period in the previous year, although it forecast that losses in the same period would be lower.

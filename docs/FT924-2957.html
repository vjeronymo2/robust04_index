			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: MoD takes blame for misspent funds THE USE of public money to pay for extravagant parties, go-karts and theatre tickets was an 'institutional failure', Sir Christopher France, permanent under secretary to the Ministry of Defence, told MPs yesterday. The Commons public accounts committee called Sir Christopher to explain why Pounds 1.2m, intended to reward MoD personnel for the success of a cost-cutting programme which saved Pounds 2.3bn over three years, was misspent, causing the National Audit Office to qualify the MoD accounts for 1990-91. The Pounds 1.2m formed 13 per cent of the budget allocated to the incentive and reward scheme. Parties on the HMS Argus and HMS Galahad to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Royal Naval Supply and Transport Service accounted for Pounds 129,000. Other unauthorised expenditure included 56 coaches and minibuses in Germany, golf club memberships, a caravan and fish tanks. 'I think the failure stretched from headquarters right through the system,' Sir Christopher said. He said the amount of money involved was not large, but said: 'It is not small change - it is like the housemaid's baby, it should not be there at all.' He blamed ambiguities in the scheme's guidelines for some of the problems. According to the guidelines, the fund was to reward 'the whole defence community', meaning that civilians as well as service personnel should benefit, but this was interpreted as meaning that families of servicemen should be included. Confusion over whether senior finance officers needed to be consulted on spending added to the irregularities. Sir Christopher defended the fact that only one senior finance officer and one line manager had been rebuked, and no formal disciplinary proceedings had been started. 'A judgement was made that at the time that in the circumstances it would not stand up if we took it through to the disciplinary tribunal,' he said.</p>

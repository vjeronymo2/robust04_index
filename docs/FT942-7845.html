			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Miners reject weekend shifts deal More than 2,500 British Coal pit employees have missed out on a Pounds 6,000 one-off bonus after accepting the advice of their unions to refuse an agreement which would commit them to working at weekends for the first time. Failure to accept the deal also means they will receive less in severance pay should future employers make them redundant. They will receive the statutory minimum of Pounds 6,150 rather than the Pounds 27,000 maximum available under the agreement signed by 9,200 of their colleagues. Most of those who refused to sign the working hours and redundancy pay package are in the Yorkshire region, the heartland of Mr Arthur Scargill's National Union of Mineworkers. Some 44 per cent of miners there accepted the deal, whereas 90 per cent of miners in the Midlands, where the Union of Democratic Mineworkers is predominant, took the package. The imbalance is likely to hit the attractions of British Coal's central north region. Potential bidders have been put off because of the perceived militancy of the NUM. British Coal said yesterday that it had warned miners they would not be eligible for the increased pay-off unless they had signed up by last Friday. However, there is likely to be pressure from prospective bidders for British Coal to extend the deadline. They are unlikely to want to inherit a group of workers who are working on varied contracts. The UDM said that some of its members had tried to sign up on Monday but were turned away. Mr Mick Stephens, a union official, said some miners had been given less notice than others about the terms of the offer.</p>

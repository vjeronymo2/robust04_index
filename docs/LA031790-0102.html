			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NFL OWNERS GET TOUGH ON DRUG TESTING, EASE UP ON FREE AGENCY  </P> <P> In two of the boldest decisions ever reached at their winter meetings, the  NFL's leaders this week resolved:  </P> <P>  -- To act unilaterally on steroids, forcing players to undergo unannounced,  year-round testing.  </P> <P>  -- To take a more conciliatory stance in player relations, leading to some  form of free agency.  </P> <P> In the long term, the league's move toward free agency could prove the more  historic, bringing the players back into collective bargaining.  </P> <P> Short term, though, the NFL's tougher stance on steroids is causing the most  commotion.  </P> <P> From Washington, NFL Players Assn. leaders said they won't immediately  challenge NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue on random steroid testing.  </P> <P> "We don't have a collective bargaining agreement with the NFL," said Doug  Allen, the players' assistant executive director. "So we don't have any (base)  for a protest.  </P> <P> "But if any player feels his rights are being violated, the association will  assist him in every way it can to make a (courtroom) challenge."  </P> <P> The NFLPA's executive director, Gene Upshaw, was unavailable, but Allen said  it's impossible to make a judgment on Tagliabue's plan because the  commissioner's presentation was incomplete.  </P> <P> "How is he going to administer these tests?" Allen asked. "In drug-testing  programs, the details on exactly how you're going to do it are what's  important.  </P> <P> "Last year, when (the NFLPA) gave (its own street-drug) tests, the results in  several cases differed from the NFL's. Some of the suspended players were  (cleared) in our tests."  </P> <P> Earlier in the week, Allen, Upshaw's assistant for many years, was the target  of criticism by Tagliabue, who said that he gets along with Upshaw, but that  "Allen has his own union."  </P> <P> Allen said: "I have no idea what he meant. I've only met the man once."  </P> <P> To some listeners, Tagliabue's remarks seemed to fit into the NFL's  divide-and-conquer strategy in union relations. There is a feeling that Allen  is more aggressive than Upshaw in advancing players' rights, prompting NFL  leaders to act more belligerently toward Allen.  </P> <P> In any case, Tagliabue emerged this week as much more of a union basher -- at  least in public -- than predecessor Pete Rozelle.  </P> <P> Repeatedly, Tagliabue suggested that NFLPA leadership doesn't speak for the  athletes.  </P> <P> Since taking office five months ago, Tagliabue has met privately with players  of four clubs, and this week he sought to create the impression that all were  solidly against Upshaw and Allen.  </P> <P> "The players kept telling me: 'Save us from our union,' " Tagliabue said.  </P> <P> Said Allen: "That is obviously nonsense. Management is always trying to make  you believe that the players are being led astray by the leaders. The fact is,  Upshaw was reelected last June for three years. He was unanimously reelected."  </P> <P> Some attending Tagliabue's first convention as commissioner this week said his  aggressive stance might have been a pose to intimidate players while he works  behind the scenes for a quick collective bargaining agreement.  </P> <P> They pointed out that his actions were milder than his words. Most prominently,  Tagliabue removed the Management Council's Jack Donlan from responsibility for  a labor-peace solution and gave it to a new committee of club executives.  </P> <P> Although Donlan will head the committee, the real power has passed to the four  committee members -- club vice presidents John Shaw of the Rams and Bill Polian  of Buffalo and club presidents Mike Lynn of Minnesota and Steve Gutman of the  New York Jets.  </P> <P> This group has a mission to develop a peace proposal that will meet most of the  expectations of most owners and players in the four problem areas -- limited  free agency, payroll cap, a salary scale for at least younger players and a  method of financing the plan from, at the least, pooled TV revenue and pooled  gate receipts.  </P> <P> "The clubs are ready to adopt some such package," Philadelphia owner Norman  Braman said. "There are far more than 21 votes for something of this kind. What  (the committee) has to do is develop a plan that will fly."  </P> <P> The league has spent the last three years without a collective bargaining  agreement with the players because of a disagreement over free agency, which  the players insist is a precondition, and which the owners have said they will  never grant.  </P> <P> Why are the owners relenting now?  </P> <P> "They just signed television contracts for more than $3 billion," Donlan said.  "And they would like to find a way to keep that money."  </P> <P> After signing two lucrative television contracts in the '80s, they found a way  to spend it -- passing most of it on to the players.  </P> <P> "Last year, the players got 59% of the (NFL gross)," Shaw said.  </P> <P> On some clubs, they got up to 63%.  </P> <P> Can the new committee work out a plan that would be closer to 50-50 for the  players and owners?  </P> <P> "It's going to be hard to do," Lynn said. "The great problem is the disparity  of income between the richest and (poorest) clubs."  </P> <P> Said Shaw: "Smaller-gross cities will have a harder time (paying for) free  agents than big cities. We have to find a way around that."  </P> <P> The real question, perhaps, is whether the NFL has embraced free agency too  late.  </P> <P> Increasingly, NFL players have seemed content with what they have already  earned -- without the help of collective bargaining contracts.  </P> <P> NFL player salaries average more than $300,000 annually. They went up 30% last  year and 43% in the last two years -- without any collective agreement -- and  have continued to rise since the NFLPA recently decertified as a union.  </P> <P> Not long ago, Upshaw, speaking to a group of players, said: "To paraphrase  Ronald Reagan, why don't you ask yourself: 'Am I better off now than I was  three years ago?.' "  </P> <P> Put that way, the problem of a decertified union isn't a problem at all.  Although the NFL's owners have cut off the players' benefits package -- which  included severance pay, insurance, and pension contributions -- that package  was only worth about $25,000 a player per year when it was eliminated. Since  then, salaries have gone up about $90,000.  </P> <P> Moving toward toward free agency, Tagliabue conceded: "What the players want is  bidding for their services."  </P> <P> Or as Doug Allen said: "The owners doubled their television income this year by  playing one network against the other. In other words, they did it with a free  market. Well, a free market is all we want."  </P> <P> NFL Notes  </P> <P> Roger Staubach and Pat Haden, two of the more celebrated quarterbacks of the  1970s, were on the NFL's new Former Players Advisory Board that met for the  first time Friday with Commissioner Paul Tagliabue. They spent six hours  conferring on drug testing, minority hiring and college eligibility.  </P> <P> One of Haden's principal areas of interest is college eligibility, he said  after recommending an adaptation of the Joe Paterno system at Penn State.  </P> <P> "Paterno brings in former Penn State players who also played in the NFL to tell  his squad what it's really like in pro ball," said Haden, a Los Angeles lawyer  who is also a CBS football analyst.  </P> <P> The NFL's new international spring league, the World League, granted its first  U.S. franchise to Orlando.  </P></p>

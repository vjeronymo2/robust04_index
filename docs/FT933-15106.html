			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / UK Company News: A fall from defending heights - Why the Panel is to investigate Owners Abroad THE TAKEOVER Panel yesterday confirmed it would investigate Owners Abroad after the holiday company's dramatic profits warning on Thursday. It has a simple brief. First of all, it will focus on whether representations made by Owners Abroad and its City advisers accurately reflected the state of the company's business at the time of the bid. Apart from factual accuracy, it will also assess whether any facts were omitted that could have foreshadowed the statement that Owners Abroad's profits would reach only half the level expected at the time of the bid. At its simplest, the investigation will need to answer how a business - even one as volatile as the holiday tour business - could go quite so wrong only four months after Owners had said the group was having a record year. Throughout the bid Owners and Airtours traded statistics designed to show that they were gaining market share or that they were significantly ahead of the previous year's levels. Statistical support was deployed in such abundance that some institutions, even at the climax of the bid, admitted they simply did not know the true picture or who to believe. What most shareholders heard loud and clear from Owners Abroad, however, was that the trend of the defending company's trading was sharply upwards, from a poor previous year, and that there was no hint of the profits collapse that has now emerged. When Owners Abroad in one of its last defence documents said it would increase its full year 1993 dividend by 43 per cent to 5p, this was seen as no more than confirmation of the bullish trading statements they had heard to date. Owners Abroad and Samuel Montagu, its advisers, were at pains on Thursday to say that no profits forecast was actually made during the bid. Formally this is also the Takeover Panel's position. Dividend forecasts, the panel says, do not constitute formal earnings forecasts. But investors immediately worked out that a 5p dividend, if covered about twice by earnings, implied profits of about Pounds 27m, the level the market was expecting until Thursday's announcement. There is one compelling reason for believing the board did not foresee the problems that emerged this week. Had the Owners board recommended Airtours' offer - as indeed it was on the verge of doing late in the bid - the board members would have made a personal profit of Pounds 20m on shares they owned. As things have transpired, their stakes are now worth about half that now, leaving much of their personal wealth tied up in a company with a questionable future. Institutions were therefore suspecting that Owners Abroad's troubles resulted from a management that simply lost control of the business. Having bought too many beds in the wrong resorts at the wrong prices, Owners has been hit by a rapid erosion of margins - an inevitable consequence of making mistakes when operational gearing is as high as it is in the holiday business. It seems that the holiday industry has confirmed, once again, why it deserves such a low stock market rating.</p>

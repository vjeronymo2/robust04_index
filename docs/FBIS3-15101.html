			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Skorokhodov: "Golden Rain. What To Do </F> With Dollar Loans and Credits"]    [Text] Almaty -- Vice Premier Akezhan Kazhegeldin has told  journalists how many dollars foreign countries are promising  Kazakhstan this year. The total is more than $1 billion. But  the republic will need the same amount again to cover the  expected budget deficit of 4 percent of GNP.    "First and foremost there is the rehabilitation loan,  whereby  Austria gives us $5 million, Sweden and Turkey $2 million each,  the United States $31 million, the European Union $60 million,  the Asian Development Bank $34 million, international financial  corporations $30 million, the World Bank $256 million, and  Russia $20 million... In all we get $719.3 million." The vice  premier began the meeting with these figures.    Moreover, Kazakhstan is promised trade credits worth $296.9  million. Finally, there will also be technical aid, to get  market structures operating in Kazakhstan. It will amount to  more than $72 million. More than $40 million of this is grants,  that is, they are nonrepayable. If you add all this up, it  could mean that more than $1.344 billion will be injected into  the economy this year.    How does the republic intend to use these financial  injections? Some $255 million from the IMF will go to the  National Bank to support the tenge. Some $719 million will be  used to keep the balance of payments deficit from exceeding 4  percent of GNP, which is an essential condition imposed by the  creditors. How Kazakhstan intends to settle all these loans is  another matter. Indeed, it is already committed to an outlay of  $85 million this year to service credits.    Russia's position is interesting in connection with the  dollar euphoria in the republic. It is itself a donor to  Kazakhstan. In the first place it actively interceded on  Kazakhstan's behalf in the Paris Club, evidently reckoning that  dollar injections there would support the reforms in Russia  itself. Second, as in the past, it granted technical credit in  rubles.    Vice Premier Kazhegeldin believes that if it carries on like  this, if the reforms are implemented "according to plan," then  Kazakhstan itself will become a donor-country in five or six  years' time and will help these countries with credits.</p>

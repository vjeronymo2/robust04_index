			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Russian defence minister says they cannot help Georgia with military action RUSSIA'S defence minister, Mr Pavel Grachev, said yesterday his country could not help in Georgia with military action, as this could be interpreted as interfering in the internal affairs of another country, Reuter reports. But Mr Grachev, on a visit to Finland, said Russian, Azerbaijani, Armenian and Georgian troops could go to Tbilisi at the request of Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, to secure supplies of food and medicine into the country. Rebels backing ex-president Zviad Gamsakhurdia have made strong gains in western Georgia in recent days, threatening supplies to the capital. 'Georgia is an independent state with which Russia does not have any agreement on mutual military co-operation. Georgia is not a CIS country and is not thus part of collective security arrangements,' Mr Grachev said. His comments followed a late-night appeal for military help by Mr Shevardnadze.</p>

When an application contains such information, or is amended to contain such information, it will be considered in determining whether an application is eligible for an extension under this section. A request may be made of any applicant to supply such information within a non-extendable period of not less than one (1) month whenever multiple applications for extension of more than one patent are received and rely upon the same regulatory review period. Failure to provide such information within the period for response set shall be regarded as conclusively establishing that the applicant is not the holder of the regulatory approval [and is not expressly and exclusively authorized by the holder of the regulatory approval to seek the extension being sought]. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Determinations made under this section shall be included in the notice of final determination of eligibility for extension of the patent term pursuant to &sect;1.750 and shall be regarded as part of that determination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8.

This was greeted  with laughter because, the previous night, the two leaders left  the building of the Council of Ministers Office quietly by a  side gate, just as they had entered it earlier, well after 2300  hours.    Following that evening meeting as well as the one that took  place yesterday afternoon, the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]  leader stressed that the talks, held after the present  government's 100 days in office, were essential: Both sides,  which had never collaborated officially before, should assess  pragmatically what was good and what was bad in their joint  track record so far. In Aleksander Kwasniewski's opinion, the  case of [the resignation of Finance] Vice Minister Borowski,  which arose in connection with Stefan Kawalec's dismissal, was a  simple case of "casualty at work" and could not in any way  affect relations within the coalition. According to Kwasniewski,  the prime minister still wanted to work with Borowski, whom he  regarded as an important figure in the government. "There is no  other way than reinforcing the coalition," Aleksander  Kwasniewski insisted, "because it would be a pity to waste time  on conflicts."    GLOS PORANNY's reporter asked Aleksander Kwasniewski whether  matters connected with privatization were one of the subjects of  his talks with the prime minister. In reply, the SLD leader  said: "Too much of a fuss is made about this problem. We have  agreed with the prime minister that, beginning next week, we  will talk about that whole question in the company of competent  people. We do not score any credits by our present handling of  the privatization question. The prime minister had an  opportunity to talk in Brussels with representatives of the  European Union as well as with U.S. investors, and he knows that  they all await answers on questions of privatization. We cannot  talk about these questions at the same time with the voice of  Ownership Transformations Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek and that of  Bogdan Pek (Polish Peasant Party), chairman of the Sejm  Commission for Ownership Transformations, because no sensible  concept will arise from the combination of these two views."  The SLD leader also told us: "It is premature and probably  quite inappropriate to talk about the Bank Slaski [Silesian  Bank] racket [reference to recent stock exchange dealings]. I  do not believe that anyone could formulate such far-reaching  conclusions from the quite unique situation that prevails at the  Warsaw Stock Exchange. Let us not make such rash judgments. If  such an admittedly somewhat unfortunate operation connected with  the Bank Slaski can become a potential starting point for a  government crisis, we should draw only one conclusion from it:  We must allow no more risky operations like that--no  privatization, no stock exchange, no capital turnover. But what  can we have instead? Well, we already know, more or less, what  we can have instead. We cannot claim that we have not tried an  alternative solution before. In my opinion, we should rather  reinforce those mechanisms that permit better and more effective  functioning of financial systems, and we should draw appropriate  conclusions from our failures. But let us not resort to  invoking the bogeyman of financial rackets."</p>

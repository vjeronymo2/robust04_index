			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: AT&amp;T buys interactive computer games unit AT&amp;T, the US telecoms group, is to acquire The ImagiNation Network, an on-line computer service offering games and entertainment, in a move to expand its involvement in the emerging market for interactive multimedia services. The move follows this week's announcement by Microsoft, the world's largest software company, that it plans a worldwide on-line services network offering information, communications and entertainment features. AT&amp;T, which previously held a 20 per cent stake in the ImagiNation Network, will pay about Dollars 40m for the remaining equity. The network is a fledgling California venture formed by Sierra On-Line, a computer games software developer, and General Atlantic Partners, a venture capital firm. Sierra On-Line will continue to provide interactive games for the network as part of the sale agreement with AT&amp;T. Mr Thomas Pomeroy, vice-president of sales and marketing for The ImagiNation Network, said AT&amp;T's investment would help the network expand its membership. The service currently offers PC users a wide choice of computer games, and subscribers can also join on-line 'chat' sessions, use bulletin boards and send electronic mail. About 6.5m consumers use on-line services, an increase of about 33 per cent since the beginning of this year, according to Simba, a market research group which is projecting accelerated growth over the next few years. US consumer on-line service revenues were Dollars 558m in 1993, and are expected to increase to Dollars 708m this year, it says. AT&amp;T said The ImagiNation network will become part of a newly-formed business unit focused on consumer interactive services. The unit will also include AT&amp;T's recently-launched PersonaLink services for users of PCs and personal communicators. Novell said it had entered an agreement with General Instrument Corp to provide networking services such as access to the Internet, home banking and home shopping to consumers through cable TV networks, Reuter reports from Las Vegas.</p>

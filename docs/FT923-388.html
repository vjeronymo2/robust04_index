			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Swedish bank cuts overnight lending rate SWEDEN'S central bank cut its marginal overnight lending rate to commercial banks from 50 per cent to 40 per cent yesterday in a cautious adjustment towards a 'more normal interest rate level'. It said the reduction had been made possible by declining turbulence on the international foreign exchange markets and a drop in Sweden's money market interest rates. But Svenska Handelsbanken, a leading commercial bank, warned yesterday in its latest economic forecast that for at least the next six months interest rates would remain above the levels existing before the financial crisis began. However, it suggested a Swedish export recovery would strengthen overseas market confidence in the country's fixed exchange rate policy and the interest rate differential rate between Sweden and Germany would narrow. It predicts a further drop of 0.4 per cent in GNP next year after an estimated decline of 1.7 per cent this year. The forecast shows only a modest 1.5 per cent recovery in 1994. It also predicts a sizeable decline in property investment of 46.5 per cent, but a strong recovery in the trade balance and the balance of payments. Swedes, however, will see real incomes fall next year by 1.9 per cent, with only a 0.7 per cent improvement in 1994.</p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / European Court may censure UK over water purity laws THE EUROPEAN Court of Justice is expected to find the UK guilty of failing to comply with EC law on drinking water purity. The court's advocate general yesterday endorsed two of the charges brought against Britain by the European Commission. The development will be an embarrassment to the government, which is trying to emphasise the success of its environmental policy. It came as Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, was in Brussels talking to Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, environment commissioner, about the British presidency of the EC later this year. The court's judgment, likely to be made around Easter, will do little to improve relations between the UK and Brussels environment authorities. These were soured in October when Mr Ripa di Meana asked the UK to halt seven construction projects until it was established that it had complied with a directive requiring environmental impact studies. The advocate general's opinion was yesterday was that the UK had not adequately transposed the 1980 directive on drinking water into national law and that nitrates in East Anglian water exceeded the limit of 50 milligrammes per litre laid down in the directive. But he said a complaint about lead pollution in Scottish water should be dismissed for insufficient evidence. Court judgments usually follow the advocate general's opinion. Mr Heseltine declined to comment on the dispute after meeting Mr Ripa di Meana but said Britain had one of the best records in complying with Community regulations. In London, Mrs Ann Taylor, Labour's minister for environmental protection, said: 'The EC ruling shows the government is granting licences to pollute and the water companies are putting profits before pollution controls.' Friends of the Earth, the environmental organisation which initiated the complaint, said that during 1990 5.3m people in East Anglia and the Midlands received water with nitrate in excess of drinking water directive standards. The Water Services Association, representing the 10 big water and sewage companies, said that, even where nitrates were above set levels, they were well within World Health Organisation limits. The UK water industry has a Pounds 1.8bn programme to reduce nitrates and comply with the directive by 1995. Clean-up scheme, Page 26</p>

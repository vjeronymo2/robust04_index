			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana is on his  way to Brazil, where he will take part in the meeting between  the 12 members of the EU [European Union] and the countries  belonging to the Rio Group, which consists of Mexico and the 10  South American countries. From Barajas airport in Madrid, here  is our correspondent Hector Arenas.    [Begin recording] [Arenas] Spanish Foreign Minister Javier  Solana described the meeting in Rio de Janeiro as one of the  most important between the EU and South American countries.  This meeting is taking place after the approval and signing of  the Uruguay Round. Foreign Minister Solana added that this  meeting between Europeans and South Americans belonging to the  Rio Group starts taking into account that last year the EU  increased its investments in the American continent. They are  now 33 percent, higher than the 30 percent made in the emerging  Asian countries.    Furthermore Solana highlighted the importance Spain gives to  its relations with South American countries, not only  economically but also politically, in the state reforms and in  the battle against poverty.    [Solana] It has to do with what we could call sustained  development -- sustained development in the fight against  poverty in the first place, and second, what we could call the  measures for reforming the state, modernizing the state. We  should remember that there is a cooperation far more important  than the economic one -- especially for those countries with a  growth of more than 3 percent; in other words, the countries of  the Rio Group. Now there is an interest in cooperation, in  helping with modernizing the state and its institutions.    [Arenas] Solana underlined his frustration from the recent  Bosnian-Serb attacks on the population of Gorazde. After these  attacks, Spain and the countries searching for a solution to the  conflict in Bosnia have decided to act together on two main  fronts: to answer the request by the UN secretary general to  extend the Sarajevo model to other safe areas and to coordinate  a diplomatic initiative.    And finally Solana announced that Spain was the first  country  to manage to get all of its citizens, mainly nuns and priests,  out of Rwanda. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

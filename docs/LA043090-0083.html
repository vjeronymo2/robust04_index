			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS 58TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT;  </P> <P> PRIMARY RACE AMONG GOP CANDIDATES LIKELY TO REMAIN CLOSE  </P> <P> With a little more than a month left in the campaign, some of the five  Republican candidates seeking to replace departing Assemblyman Dennis Brown are  struggling for money, others remain virtually unknown, but all are running hard  in a race that is likely to remain close through the June 5 election.  </P> <P> Brown, the 12-year Republican assemblyman from Los Alamitos, set off the  last-minute scramble for his seat just last month when he made the surprise  announcement that he would not seek reelection in his coastal district, which  stretches from Huntington Beach into Long Beach.  </P> <P> "I think it's just going to come down to the very end," said candidate Jeffrey  A. Kellogg, a Long Beach councilman. "You're just going to see a mad rush at  the very end."  </P> <P> Republicans face the only primary for the 58th Assembly District on June 5  since only one Democratic candidate, Luanne W. Pryor of Long Beach, and one  Libertarian Party member, Scott Stier of Long Beach, are entered in the race.  </P> <P> The other Republicans are Seymour Alban, a 65-year-old physician from Long  Beach; Jan Hall, another Long Beach City Council member; Huntington Beach Mayor  Thomas J. Mays; and Peter E. von Elten, a vice president at MOLA Development  Corp. in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Republicans hold a registration edge in the district of about 51% to 39%. Just  more than half of the voters are in the Long Beach portion of the district, but  the majority of Republicans are in Orange County.  </P> <P> The two candidates who have never run for political office -- Alban and von  Elten -- have the most money. Alban said he expects to spend up to $400,000 in  the primary, and von Elten's campaign was hoping for more than $200,000.  </P> <P> The three city politicians running for the office complained that they will be  vastly outspent, with some estimating their campaigns at $100,000 or less. They  noted, however, that von Elten and Alban would require more money to win  because neither has a political base.  </P> <P> As for issues, the environment has been a hot button in most races this year,  but it has been emphasized even more in the 58th district race because of the  394,000-gallon oil spill that blackened the Orange County coast following a  tanker accident in February.  </P> <P> That incident practically created Mays' candidacy. Local and national  television in the critical hours after the spill gave the local mayor a  ubiquitous presence as he spoke on behalf of angry residents.  </P> <P> Mays, 36, along with all of the Republican candidates except Kellogg, has come  out against additional offshore oil drilling and in favor of more regulation to  protect the coast from spills.  </P> <P> Kellogg, who has worked with his family's oil company operating on-shore  drilling sites, said he does not believe the waters off the 58th district  shores should accommodate more drilling, but he would not rule out his support  for a specific project.  </P> <P> "You have to take it on a case-by-case," he said.  </P> <P> Ironically, despite all of the Republican candidates appealing for  environmental votes, the district has been represented for 12 years by an  assemblyman who was rated one of the worst in the state by the League of  Conservation Voters.  </P> <P> Doug Linney, political director for the league in San Francisco, said the  campaign to replace Brown is a high priority for the group because it has a  chance to replace one of its strongest opponents with a conservationist.  </P> <P> Linney said the group plans to question each of the candidates. So far, it has  talked only to Alban.  </P> <P> "We feel fairly comfortable with him as a candidate," Linney said.  </P> <P> Alban is the only Republican candidate who expressed support for the so-called  Big Green initiative, a sweeping environmental measure that qualified Thursday  for the November ballot. Alban said, however, that he was reluctant to endorse  the measure because he believed it was being used by Democratic gubernatorial  candidate John Van de Kamp as a campaign tool.  </P> <P> Some of the other Republicans said they supported portions of the sweeping  measure, but not in its entirety.  </P> <P> Developer von Elten, 46, said he demonstrated concern for the environment when  his company paid to clean up a toxic waste dump in Huntington Beach before  building houses on the site.  </P> <P> "It was a model cleanup, and not a penny cost to the taxpayers," said von  Elten, also a Vietnam veteran.  </P> <P> On other issues, all of the Republicans except Mays are opposed to laws that  prohibit a woman from seeking an abortion. Of the four who support abortion  rights, only Kellogg is opposed to government funding for poor women seeking  abortions.  </P> <P> At a candidates' forum Thursday night in Long Beach, which Kellogg did not  attend, Mays was the only candidate opposed to some forms of gun control.  </P> <P> The other three candidates supported a 15-day waiting period for obtaining a  gun and a ban on assault rifles.  </P> <P> "Gun control is not going to solve the crime problem," Mays said. "Criminals  won't have to wait for a gun."  </P> <P> On Proposition 111, the proposed 9-cent gas tax to pay for transportation  improvements, all of the Republican candidates supported the measure except  Kellogg, who said he was unsatisfied with how the state spends the existing gas  tax.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town May 20 SAPA -- Hendrik Jacobus Coetsee,  elected president of the Senate on Friday, was born on April 19,  1931 in the Orange Free State town of Ladybrand. The only child  of Josephine (born Van Zyl) and Jan Johannes Coetsee, a printer,  he matriculated in 1948 at Ladybrand school, where he was a  prefect and a Dux scholar. He completed his BA LLB in 1954 at  the University of the Orange Free State which, eventually in  1991, was to honour him as "former kovsie of the year".    While at university he served on the students' council for  extra- mural students and was chairman of the youth branch of  the NP [National Party]. He was a part-time lecturer in law  while qualifying as an attorney and practised at the side-bar  for 17 years before being admitted to the bar in Bloemfontein as  an advocate in 1972.    He was not balloted for military service, but served as a  volunteer in the President Steyn Regiment's armoured car section  from 1964-68.    Mr Coetsee first went to Parliament in 1968 when he won the  by- election for the Bloemfontein West seat. In 1985 he became  leader of the Orange Free State NP at a time when the debate was  raging on whether measures preventing Asians from entering and  living in the Free State should be repealed. These measures  were repealed in September that year after an overwhelming  affirmative vote at the party's congress.    Mr Coetsee served on various parliamentary committees and  commissions, including the Schlebusch Commission of inquiry into  certain organisations and the Select Committee on the  Constitution in 1983. He became chairman of the defence group  of the NP caucus in 1978, and when Mr P W Botha became prime  minister he was given the position of deputy minister of defence  and national intelligence. During his two-year term in this  position, Mr Coetsee restructured the National Intelligence  Service and tailored national service requirements to protect  people suffering financial loss while doing their service.    On October 12, 1980 he was appointed minister of justice and  set about instituting reforms in the legal system. These  included the introduction of the small claims courts, the  Matrimonial Property Bill in 1984, which had major repercussions  on the status of married women, and introduced the accrual  system of property sharing between spouses. From October 1980  to July 1991 the portfolio included prisons and the mid-1980's  produced the lowest incidence of prison complaints for years.  It was in that role that he liaised between President Nelson  Mandela and his two predecessors, Mr P W Botha and Deputy  President F W de Klerk in the years preceding Mr mandela's  release. He was instrumental, in 1991, in sending top prisons  officials to the United States on a fact-finding mission about  community service as a viable alternative sentence to  imprisonment. A white paper on the subject was released in May  of that year.    The Sharpeville six case rose to prominence in 1987 when six  people were sentenced to death for the murder of the deputy  mayor of Lekoa. They were granted various stays of execution  until, on July 12, 1988, Mr Coetsee deferred their execution  indefinitely as he wanted to enable the defence lawyers to  exhaust all legal avenues open to save their clients. The death  sentence was eventually converted to life imprisonment.    In August 1987 President Botha asked Mr Coetsee to look into  the possible release of Rivonia trialist Mr Govan Mbeki, who was  serving a life sentence. Mr Mbeki was released later in the  year.    After the African National Congress was unbanned in 1990 and  Mr Nelson Mandela released, Mr Coetsee was part of the  government's delegation which held talks in May at Groote  Schuur. He also put the indemnity bill -- containing provisions  for conditional and unconditional permanent indemnity -- through  Parliament which granted temporary immunity to those who might  serve in negotiation delegations.    He married Helena Elizabeth Malan on October 6 1956. They  have three daughters and two sons.</p>

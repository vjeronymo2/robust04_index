			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Egypt and Sudan in oil dispute EGYPT AND Sudan have become embroiled in a border dispute over oil exploration in the Red Sea, and the argument seems likely to complicate already tense relations between Cairo and Khartoum. Egypt has advised all international oil companies that Sudan has no authority to sign exploration agreements for acreage north of their 'political' boundary delineated by latitude 22 degrees north under an 1899 treaty. Egypt was reacting to an agreement signed last month between Sudan and the Canadian-registered International Petroleum Corporation for seismic work in waters north of 22 degrees in an area Egypt claims as sovereign territory. Sudan, however, believes an 'administrative' boundary, agreed in 1902, which runs north of the political boundary, entitles it to allow exploration north of 22 degrees. The dispute could hardly come at a more awkward moment, with relations between moderate rulers in Cairo and the Islamicist-dominated military regime in Sudan under severe strain. It also coincides with reports of recent troubles between Egyptian and Sudanese patrols in the triangle formed by the 'political' and 'administrative' boundaries. The 'political' boundary came into effect with the Anglo-Egyptian condominium agreement of 1899. It was followed three years later by an amendment that gave Sudan administrative responsibility for tribes north of 1899 boundary in the east. Egypt was given responsibility for a small section south of the line about half-way between the Red Sea coast and the Nile. It is unclear whether the 'political' or 'administrative' boundaries have international boundary status. This issue may in the end require international jurisdiction. In the meantime Egypt, which is keen to promote offshore exploration in the Red Sea, is offering a large block which runs south to its 'political' boundary with Sudan, and in fact includes acreage targeted for exploration by International Petroleum. In Geneva, International Petroleum said it was planning to go ahead with its seismic survey in its 10,000 square kilometre Halaib block. A spokesman said that until the Egyptians had complained he had not been aware that the area was in dispute. Egypt, through its embassy in Ottawa, informed the Canadian government, and through it International Petroleum, that it regarded exploration in waters off the area under dispute latitude as 'illegal.' In Cairo, a spokesman for the Canadian embassy said the issue was under discussion with both Egypt and Sudan. He said the Sudanese were insisting they had a right to enter into exploration a greements for areas in their 'administrative' zone.</p>

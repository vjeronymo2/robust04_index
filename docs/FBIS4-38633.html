			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mulatov commentary; from the "Half an Hour With Wang Xiao" </F> program]    [Text] A delegation of the Russian Federation Government  headed by Prime Minister Chernomyrdin is continuing its official  visit to China. Chinese, Russian, and international mass media  are giving wide publicity to the visit and the Russian-Chinese  talks on expanding cooperation in economic and other fields.    Our station commentator Mulatov comments: The focus of the  ongoing Russian-Chinese talks in Beijing is to expand and  improve economic cooperation and trade between these two  neighbors, and implement modernization. A slew of major  agreements in this regard has been signed. A dispatch from  Beijing by Japan's KYODO news agency takes note of the broad  representational nature of the delegation headed by Russian  Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, pointing out that many members of  the delegation are leaders of government ministries and  competent departments, and representatives of business circles.  As everybody knows, Russian-Chinese trade has grown rapidly in  recent years. The two sides, however, are proceeding from this  understanding: that is, bilateral cooperative ties and the  potential for cooperation are far from being fully utilized.  The fact that Russia and China are neighbors and their  economies are mutually complementary will enable them to greatly  expand all-round cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual  benefits. Pointing out the growing ties in military technology  between Russia and China, some mass media in the West have not  ruled out the possibility of an accord on Russian-Chinese  military cooperation. However, prior to the Russian  Government's departure for China, (Beleiyi), a ranking official  of the Russian Foreign Ministry refuted such predictions. He  told an ITAR-TASS reporter that no military agreement whatsoever  would be signed.    The ongoing Russian-Chinese talks in Beijing are aimed at,  first of all, upgrading mutually beneficial economic cooperation  and trade between the two neighbors. Certainly, the two sides  will also discuss regional and international issues of mutual  interest. We will soon find out the specifics of bilateral  agreements reached between the two sides. These agreements are  designed to create more favorable conditions for mutually  beneficial trade, economic, and scientific and technological  exchanges between the two nations. Russian-Chinese dialogue will  resume at the highest level this fall when PRC President Jiang  Zemin makes an official visit to Russia. All in all, for China,  1994 could be described as the year of Russia; and for Russia,  the year of China.</p>

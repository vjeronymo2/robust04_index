			<p>BFN     [Text] The UK newspaper THE INDEPENDENT has reported that  the relatives of the victims of the Lockerbie accident are  divided over a documentary film about this accident. This has  prompted British official circles to intervene to prevent its  showing, under the pretext that it would influence the course of  the investigation into the affair. Although the Great  Jamahiriyah has nothing to do with this film, the British media  are endeavoring to conceal facts from the British people and  they pick out what serves Britain's colonial purposes without  respecting the truth and without showing any desire to let the  British masses know all the facts. This is the method used by  the western states to black out the facts of this affair.</p>

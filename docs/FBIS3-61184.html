The present Statute shall set forth conditions  and procedures for the issuance of permits to recruit foreign  labor in the Russian Federation, as well as certificates of the  right to labor activities on the territory of the Russian  Federation to foreign citizens.    2. The issuance of permits to recruit foreign labor  (henceforth referred to as permits) and the monitoring of their  use shall be effected by the Federal Migration Service of Russia  on the suggestions of the organs of executive power of republics  belonging to the Russian Federation, krays, oblasts, the  autonomous oblast, autonomous okrugs, and cities with federal  status.    3. The permits shall establish quotas for the recruitment of  a certain number of foreign citizens, as a whole and by  professional groups, who are hired by employers to work on the  territories of republics belonging to the Russian Federation,  krays, oblasts, the autonomous oblast, autonomous okrugs, and  cities with federal status.    4. The permits may be issued to Russian legal entities,  enterprises with foreign investment operating on the territory  of the Russian Federation, as well as particular Russian and  foreign individuals and stateless persons who reside on the  territory of the Russian Federation and use the labor of hired  employees in their personal economic units (henceforth referred  to as employers). In the process, the duration of professional  activities of the recruited foreign citizens shall not exceed  the duration of validity of the permit.    5. An employer shall submit the following to the Federal  Migration Service of Russia in order to obtain a permit:    a petition;    a proposal (findings) by the relevant organs of executive  power of a republic belonging to the Russian Federation, kray,  oblast, autonomous oblast, autonomous okrug, or city with  federal status, substantiating the feasibility of the  recruitment and use of foreign labor by the employer;    a draft labor contract, or other documents, confirming a  preliminary agreement with foreign citizens, or partners from  abroad, concerning the intention and terms for the recruitment  of foreign employees. In the process, the terms, wages, and  occupational safety for foreign citizens, and their social  welfare and insurance, shall be governed by the norms of the  legislation of the Russian Federation, taking into account the  specifics envisioned by state-to-state and  government-to-government agreements of the Russian Federation  with foreign countries.    Enterprises, offices, and organizations reporting to the  Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation shall also submit,  in order to receive permits, statements of consent by the  Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation for the  recruitment of foreign employees.    6. Proposals (findings) by organs of executive power of  republics belonging to the Russian Federation, krays, oblasts,  the autonomous oblast, autonomous okrugs, and cities with  federal status, concerning the recruitment of foreign labor by  employers shall be based on the principle of the priority right  of Russian citizens to fill vacant jobs, and shall be prepared  taking into account the availability of equivalent labor on the  territory in question and the absence of an opportunity to  redistribute labor resources from other regions of the country,  the provision of equal terms and wages for foreign employees  compared to the citizens of the Russian Federation, and the  prevention of any unfavorable impact on the employment  conditions for Russian citizens due to the hiring of foreign  citizens.    7. Decisions to issue permits shall be made by the Federal  Migration Service of Russia within 30 days of the filing of the  documents envisioned in point 5 of the present statute by the  employer. If an expert review is required in order to make a  decision, the decision shall be made within 15 days after the  receipt of expert findings, but no later than 45 days from the  date of the filing of the documents indicated.    A substantiated denial of the issuance of a permit shall be  forwarded, in writing, to the employer within five days after  the decision to deny the issuance of a permit is made.    8. As a rule, permits shall be issued for a term of up to  one  year. Based on a substantiated request from an employer, the  effect of a permit may be extended after it expires, but for no  longer than one year.    When the validity of a permit is extended, a fee in the  amount envisioned for the issuance of a permit shall be  collected from the employer.    9. A permit shall not be transferred to other employers.  Foreign employees recruited on the basis of the permit may not  be transferred to work for another employer.    10. A permit shall indicate: the name of the organ issuing  the permit, the name and address of the employer to whom the  permit has been issued and information on its state  registration, the territory on which the permit applies, the  number and breakdown of the recruited employees by profession,  their country of origin or regular residence, grounds for the  issuance of the permit, its duration of validity, and other data  in keeping with the format given in Appendix No. 1.    A permit shall be signed by the executive official empowered  by the chief of the Federal Migration Service of Russia, and is  certified with a seal.    11. Employers who have received permits to recruit foreign  labor must, within one month, forward to the Federal Migration  Service of Russia information on the signing of labor contracts  with foreign employees on the basis of the permits.    12. In the event that an employer violates the conditions of  the present statute indicated in the permit, as well as the  legislation of the Russian Federation, as a result of which the  rights of foreign employees are infringed upon, the Federal  Migration Service may suspend the effect of the permit until the  violations that have been allowed to occur are rectified, or  give instructions to rectify them by a certain date. In the  event of a failure to rectify the violations before the  specified date, the permit may be revoked by a decision of the  Federal Migration Service of Russia.    An employer may be deprived of the right to use a permit,  without notice, for an action, or a failure to act, that results  in the danger of death for people or injury to their health.    13. An issued permit shall cease to be valid, regardless of  the expiration of the term for which it was issued, in the event  that an employer discontinues his economic operations or  implements measures to reduce the number or authorized  complement of employees.    14. A foreign citizen who has entered the Russian Federation  with a view to engaging in professional activities may work for  hire on the territory of the Russian Federation only if he holds  a certificate of the right to labor activities issued in his  name on the basis of a permit received by the employer, in  keeping with the format given in Appendix No. 2.    In cases envisaged by point 16 of the present statute,  certificates of the right to labor activities in the territory  of the Russian Federation shall be issued to foreign citizens  without permits being processed.    15. Certificates of the right to labor activities shall be  issued to foreign citizens working as hired labor for an  employer within the limits of the number of recruited foreign  labor established in a permit, as well as in the cases  envisioned by point 16 of the present statute, by the  territorial organs of the Federal Migration Service of Russia,  in response to a petition in keeping with the format given in  Appendix No. 3, provided that a foreign citizen agrees.    16. Foreign citizens from among highly skilled specialists  shall be recruited on the basis of the certificate of the right  to labor activities without permits being processed in the event  of being hired by employers to work at enterprises with foreign  investment operating on the territory of the Russian Federation  in the positions of enterprise managers, their deputies, and  chiefs of divisions (including separate divisions) of these  enterprises.    17. The Federal Migration Service of Russia shall forward,  to  the relevant diplomatic missions and consular establishments of  the Russian Federation abroad, information concerning the  permits issued, which shall constitute grounds for the receipt,  by foreign citizens, of the entry and exit visas with the right  to be hired for work.    18. The compulsory procedures for the issuance of permits,  as  well as certificates of the right to labor activities,  established by the present statute shall not apply to foreign  citizens who, in keeping with the legislation of the Russian  Federation:    have been officially recognized as refugees;    permanently reside on the territory of the Russian  Federation;    have been granted asylum on the territory of the Russian  Federation;    have filed petitions to be granted refugee status and have  been issued temporary residence permits.    Nor shall the aforementioned procedures apply to foreign  citizens:    science and cultural personalities working on the territory  of the Russian Federation at establishments created in keeping  with state-to-state agreements;    staff of diplomatic and consular establishments, as well as  organizations enjoying diplomatic status and located on the  territory of the Russian Federation;    religious personalities who engage in professional  activities  on the territory of the Russian Federation in officially  registered religious organizations and societies;    crew members of Russian seagoing and river vessels;    students in production training during breaks within the  framework of the curricula of Russian educational establishments  of higher professional education;    correspondents and journalists accredited in the Russian  Federation;    lecturers and instructors invited to offer lecture courses  and do other work at Russian academies and educational  establishments of higher professional education;    individuals for whom different job placement procedures are  set forth in state-to-state and government-to-government  agreements of the Russian Federation with foreign countries.</p>

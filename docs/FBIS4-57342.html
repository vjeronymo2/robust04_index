			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia -- The Federal Supreme Court (STF) has  approved modifications to the electoral law and has thus opened  up space in the electoral competition for nine small parties.  These modifications could cause changes in a political scenario  that had been practically defined. The Social Christian Party  [PSC], for example, is already considering the possibility of  talking to Senator Jose Sarney (PMDB-AP) [Brazilian Democratic  Movement Party--Amapa] if the STF also modifies the term for  party registration.    PSC President Vitor Nosseis said Senator Sarney would be  welcome to the party if he decides to leave the PMDB to run in  the elections.    Even if Senator Sarney does not accept the PSC invitation,  the party will have a presidential candidate, chosen between  Brigadier Ivan Frota and Admiral Ernani Goulart Fortuna, former  War College commander.    Prona [Party for Redefinition of National Order] will also  have a candidate: Eneas Ferreira Carneiro, who is ready to enter  the electoral campaign with the same slogan he used during 1989:  "My name is Eneas." At that time, he had only 15 seconds of free  electoral propaganda time. Now he will have at least one minute,  and he plans to make use of the space reserved for Prona's 18  gubernatorial candidates.    Eneas asserts that if he could have two or three minutes, he  would run over his rivals like a tractor.    Among the other small parties, some still think about having  their own candidates. Most of them, however, are committed to  alliances with the large parties. The PMN [National Mobilization  Party], which ran in the last elections with Celso Brandt as  candidate, is holding talks with the PDT [Democratic Labor  Party]. The PC do B [Communist Party of Brazil], the PPS  [People's Socialist Party], and the PSTU [Unified Social Workers  Party] joined the PT [Workers Party] in supporting Lula's  candidacy. The PV [Green Party] is still holding talks with the  PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], the PT, and the PDT.  All the small parties will have free electoral propaganda time  on television, and the TSE [Superior Electoral Court] will have  to redistribute the free electoral propaganda time among 20  parties.</p>

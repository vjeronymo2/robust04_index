			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (7): Carmakers focus on labour cuts - If the future seems black, the present looks even blacker / Germany THE rejuvenation of the German motor industry is under way with a vengeance  -especially at Volkswagen. The company recently concluded a deal with its workers' councils under which employees will be able to retire at 55. For the five years until they become eligible for a normal pension, Volkswagen workers will be paid 90 per cent of their net salary: a third from the company and the rest from state employment budgets. While this milestone agreement demonstrates the vigour with which VW is cutting its labour force in its fight to return to profit, it also shows how difficult it has become to cut the fat. Reduction of the retirement age is a costly attempt to avoid the unthinkable: forced redundancies. Common enough in the UK and the US, they are almost unknown in Germany's 'social economy'. Almost 100,000 jobs have disappeared from the German vahicle industry in the past two years. Furthermore, according to Mr Achim Diekmann, director of the VDA industry association, another 100,000 must go by the middle of 1995. In the meantime, overall costs must be reduced by 20 to 30 per cent, he says. If the future seems black, the present looks even blacker. The industry association is now counting on German car production tumbling from 4.86m last year to about 4m in 1993 - a drop of 18 per cent compared with springtime forecasts, considered grim at the time, of 10 per cent. The French and Italian markets have failed to produce expected sales growth because of recession and revaluation of the D-Mark. Some German makers have increased list prices to compensate but, according to analysts, risk losing market share. Volkswagen, for example, has raised Italian prices by about 11 per cent. In Germany, too, the drop in new car registrations is markedly worse, so far, than the expected 20 per cent decline for 1993 - and now the VDA is worried that next January's 16-pfennig increase in the cost of petrol, coming at a time when disposable incomes are shrinking in real terms, will prolong the domestic downturn. On top of all this, the industry is concerned about the damage to German brands' export potential which could be caused by Volkswagen's bitter set-to with Adam Opel, General Motors' German subsidiary. But the extraordinary story of VW's seduction of GM's Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the renowned 'cost-killer,' and the clouds of allegations which followed him from Detroit to Wolfsburg, have tended to obscure the deep-seated restructuring going on throughout the German car industry before Lopez arrived and unleashed his procurement 'warriors' on parts suppliers. Almost two years ago the industry at large turned its attention to what is seen as its greatest problem: cost. Whatever quality, image and engineering advantages German cars may possess, their sales prospects are hobbled by their being 20 per cent too expensive. According to the VDA, labour costs per vehicle produced in France, almost the same as in Germany 10 years ago, are now about 30 per cent less than levels across the border. The German labour force was the first, obvious target for the knife, but as VW's early-retirement programme illustrates, there are limits if confrontation with the workforce is to be avoided. But the search for economies has spread far beyond car manufacturing plants. Germany's estimated 3,000 components companies are now in the front line, confronted by demands for instant price cuts, new contracts and threats if they do not comply. Much has been made of VW's blunt demands for 30 per cent price cuts. Two companies have already claimed that they have been driven out of business by its tactics. The survivors complain they have already paid their dues for the restructuring of the industry, and cite independent research by Deutsche Bank analysts which shows that between 1985 and 1992 components prices increased by only about 5 per cent, while retail prices of cars rose more than a quarter. But however justified their appeals may be, they are caught in a deadly squeeze. As Mr Lopez discovered at Opel - part of a multinational group with wide international contacts - there are plenty of French, Italian, British and other suppliers willing to step into any breach left by German manufacturers which fail to meet his demands. Former communist-bloc countries increasingly offer even cheaper sources for some parts. This has not gone unnoticed elsewhere. According to industry estimates, the foreign content of an average German car is already 30 per cent, compared with 25 per cent last year. Mercedes, for example, which traditionally buys about 90 per cent of its components from German companies, is seeking to reduce the proportion to about 75 per cent. According to VW's new management, the German motor industry is fighting for its life. No-one wins such a struggle without pain and sacrifice.</p>

			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / People: Associating chemicals with electricity The Electricity Association, the trade association which represents both the privatised and nationalised parts of Britain's electricity industry, has switched to the chemical industry for its next leader. Philip Daubeney, 55, who has spent 32 years climbing the ICI management ladder, is to take over as chief executive from Roger Farrance who retires, at 60, in November. A history graduate of Balliol, Oxford, Daubeney has come up on the commercial side of ICI and is currently regional chief executive of the African and Eastern region. The Electricity Association is one of Britain's youngest trade associations, having been born out of the rump of the old Electricity Council which used to oversee the nationalised industry. Only three years old, it has had some difficulty adjusting from being master of the industry to being its servant. Although it has a mere 20 members and four associates, it employs around 200 people. In addition to providing the traditional services of a trade body, the association also continues to supply common services to the industry. The decision to recruit the association's next chief executive from outside the electricity industry is another sign of the radical changes that have taken place since the demise of the old Electricity Council. Daubeney says that there are some similarities between the industry he is leaving and the one he is joining. They are both capital intensive and he believes that the electricity industry may soon have to confront exactly those environmental issues with which the chemical industry has already been grappling.</p>

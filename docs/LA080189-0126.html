			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WESTERN DIGITAL SAYS LAST YEAR'S EARNINGS FELL 21%, SALES RISE  </P> <P> Hampered by a computer industry slump and heavy losses in a new product line,  Western Digital Corp. said Monday that its earnings fell 21% last year as the  company narrowly missed the $1-billion sales mark.  </P> <P> The Irvine-based computer company earned $34.3 million for its fiscal year  ended June 30, compared to earnings of $43.4 million in 1988. Sales rose 22%,  to $992.1 million for the year, up from $768.3 million in 1988.  </P> <P> Analysts said Western Digital's results were in line with expectations.  </P> <P> "Western Digital has been warning us that this (fourth) quarter would be  disappointing," said Benny Lorenzo, an analyst with Volpe &amp; Covington, a  San Francisco investment firm. "Some analysts are frustrated with Western  Digital, but they've done quite a bit to improve" the company's financial  condition.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'I'm Not Disappointed'  </P> <P> Western Digital Chairman Roger W. Johnson said the company had predicted higher  earnings at the beginning of the fiscal year, "but overall, I'm not  disappointed with where we ended up for the fourth quarter and year."  </P> <P> Western Digital, the county's largest high-technology company, is a  manufacturer of data storage devices and varied other components for the  personal computer industry.  </P> <P> Johnson said the company was hurt by sluggish sales of personal computers last  year, which he partly attributed to a severe industrywide shortage of key  computer memory chips in 1988 and early 1989.  </P> <P> He also said the company's results were dampened by "several significant  internal product and technology transitions."  </P> <P> The company's heaviest losses resulted from sluggish growth in its  "motherboard" business. Motherboards are memory boards on which chips are  mounted for use inside personal computers.  </P> <P> Sluggish growth "cost us a lot of money during the year," said Johnson,  attributing the losses to confusion in the industry over several competing  computer design standards.  </P> <P> Johnson said the market for another new product, an "integrated" computer disk  drive for personal computers, also did not develop as quickly as expected.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Products Profitable  </P> <P> The losses from the motherboard and integrated-disk-drive products adversely  affected the company's data storage, computer graphics and communications  products, all of which were "very profitable," he said.  </P> <P> Johnson said he looks for improved results for the current year: "We should  have good solid improvement in revenues for the rest of this year, and profits  should grow faster than revenues."  </P> <P> Fourth-quarter earnings fell to $4.3 million, down 70% from $14.7 million in  the year-ago period. Sales were down 12%, to $243.5 million from the  year-earlier quarter, and were essentially unchanged from the third quarter.  </P> <P> WESTERN DIGITAL PERFORMANCE  </P> <P> (Year ended June 30)  </P> <P> (in millions)  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.56IN:1.89IN:2.22IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Revenue  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Net Income  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $992  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $34.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 768  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 43.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1987  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 481  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 45.8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1986  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 300  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 21.5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1985  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 189  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> (4.1 loss)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Observer: Official inflation The Bank of England is understandably cautious about sticking its neck out. But one trend it cannot ignore is the increasing size of its official history. Sir John Clapham's review of the Bank's first 100 years took 305 pages, and his study of the next century ran to 460. However, historical inflation really took off under Professor Richard Sayers who devoted three volumes, and 1,468 pages, to the period between 1891 and 1944. The next episode, by former executive director John Fforde, is due out next month, and it is an even bigger blockbuster. Covering the 17-year period up to 1958, it runs to 866 pages. This works out at an average of just over 50 pages per year, compared with Clapham's rate of under three. Oh, and by the way, Observer's calculations understate the dramatic increase. Fforde confines himself to a study of public policy. A separate volume on the Bank's administration over the period is being prepared by Elizabeth Hennessey.</p>

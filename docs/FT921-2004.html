			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Inspiration from meditation plan A NEW party entered the election race yesterday, spending about Pounds 1m on full-page national newspaper advertisements and promising to field candidates in all 651 constituencies. The Natural Law Party, launched less than a week ago, bases itself on the teachings of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the founder of the Transcendental Meditation programme and two universities. Party official Peter Warburton yesterday declined to give details about financial backers. He said the party, whose lengthy manifesto was published in national newspapers yesterday with photographs of 119 election contenders, would have candidates for all 651 seats by next Wednesday, which is the final date for registration. The candidates would be paying their own deposits. Mr Warburton said the party's aim was to introduce an ideal system of administration to the country. Although that might seem idealistic, the party would implement very practical measures to achieve that aim. Mr Warburton hoped that the party would be granted a party political broadcast. It had met one of the conditions to qualify by fielding more than 50 candidates. Mr Warburton refused to comment on plans for further advertising, though he said that the party had formed a nationwide fund-raising organisation called The Heaven on Earth club. He said the party depended on unnamed well-wishers for donations, including about 160,000 people in the UK who have studied transcendental meditation under the Maharishi's guidance. The party has a slogan - 'Only a new seed will yield a new crop' - and its symbol is a rainbow. Its leader is Mr Geoffrey Clements, who is a professor of physics at one of the Maharishi's universities.</p>

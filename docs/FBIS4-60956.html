			<p>BFN     [Text] Southern Kazakhstan's biggest thermoelectric plant,  the Chimkent Thermoelectric-3 Plant, has stopped working after  the failure of one of the pumps caused the plant's cable network  to burn out. It took about three hours to put out the fire.  The accident has practically brought to a halt two industrial  giants -- a tyre factory and an oil refinery. Work is under way  to clear up the accident.</p>

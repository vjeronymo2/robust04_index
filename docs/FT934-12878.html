			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Wheat exports to US face trade sanctions US congressmen representing northern wheat-growing states may be close to success in their push to impose emergency curbs against Canadian wheat imports into the US. The congressmen, led by North Dakota Senator Kent Conrad, have been campaigning against agricultural provisions of the US/Canada free trade agreement for a year, and see a fresh opportunity to push their case in Washington as President Bill Clinton's search for votes in support of the North American Free Trade Agreement becomes more desperate. Wheat growers in North Dakota, Montana and Idaho say Canada unfairly subsidises rail transport for its wheat exports, leaving US producers at a disadvantage. However, they were unsuccessful in pressing their case before a US/Canadian arbitration panel in the summer. Mr Michael Espy, US agriculture secretary, and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, indicated in mid-September that they supported using an emergency section of the US Agricultural Adjustment Act against Canada. The section would impose either tariffs or quotas on Canadian imports. Mr Espy so far has not imposed sanctions but could do so soon, after Canadian elections today. 'I think the general sentiment is, we don't want to make a decision on a trade issue that could have a potential impact on the outcome of the elections,' said a spokeswoman for Mr Conrad. The wheat dispute is another example of special interest farm groups' pressure on national trade policy. It centres on durum, a variety of wheat used to make pasta. US production has fallen as farmers choose to plant hard red spring wheat, which is a more profitable crop. Durum comprises only 3 per cent of the entire US wheat crop. However, the US Department of Agriculture has been aggressively exporting US durum to countries such as Turkey and Algeria using its export enhancement programme subsidies. It plans to sell about 816,000 metric tonnes of durum under the programme this year, at an average cost to the US taxpayer of about Dollars 1.75 (Pounds 1.15) a bushel. The outflow of durum under the programme has boosted prices paid to US farmers to a near-record Dollars 4.50 per bushel, and left US durum processors scrambling for high-quality grain. Canada has filled in the deficit, selling about 398,000 metric tonnes of durum to US processors last year. While North Dakota wheat interests say tariffs against imports will further raise prices for US farmers, their critics contend that sanctions will either put domestic durum processors out of business, or force them to relocate to Canada.</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Brazil acts as influx of dollars threatens anti-inflation policy THE Brazilian Central Bank is trying to slow the recent rush of dollars into the economy, threatening the government's anti-inflationary policy. An excess of dollars is an ironic problem for a country which just six months ago had to suspend the gold operations of its central bank because reserves had reached critical levels of Dollars 7bn, below which debt payments are halted. But in the past four months Brazil has had net inflows of Dollars 9bn. This has been the result of an increase in export contracts and a flood of foreign investment, attracted by cheap prices on the stock exchange and high real interest rates, as well as increased confidence in the Brazilian economy. To stop this jeopardising the government's tight monetary policy, the Treasury has had to soak up the extra liquidity by issuing bonds at interest rates of 30 per cent a year, which has produced a staggering rise in domestic public debt. Between September and February this grew 87 per cent above inflation. This compares to a 30 per cent growth in the whole of the government's preceding 22 months in office since President Fernando Collor's asset freeze in March 1990 which reduced treasury debt from Dollars 54bn to Dollars 5bn overnight. The increase in domestic debt, coupled with falling tax revenues, has led to fears that Brazil will fail to meet the fiscal targets set in its recent accord with the International Monetary Fund but the Economy Ministry insists the situation is under control. Market estimates put current foreign exchange reserve levels at Dollars 15bn. Last week Mr Collor warned that the government must take care to prevent reserves reaching Dollars 20bn too rapidly. As a first step, the central bank has halved to 180 days the maximum period of anticipation on foreign exchange contracts for exports to stop exporters using the money for speculating in the financial markets to take advantage of high interest rates.</p>

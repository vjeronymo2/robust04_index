			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Airbus suffers Dollars 3.5bn setback: Northwest Airlines cancels orders for 74 European-built aircraft THE EUROPEAN Airbus consortium, which includes British Aerospace, suffered a significant setback yesterday when Northwest Airlines of the US cancelled orders for 74 aircraft, worth a total of Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.3bn), as part of a refinancing package to stave off bankruptcy. The cancellations are a particularly heavy blow for Airbus, because they involve its latest airliner, the A340 long-range wide-bodied jet. Northwest was the single biggest customer for the A340 with 24 firm orders, all of which were cancelled yesterday. The airliner is due to enter service for the first time next year with Lufthansa, Air France and, until yesterday, Northwest. Northwest also cancelled orders for 50 Airbus A320 narrow-body twin engine airliners. It was one of the biggest customers for the A320, having originally ordered 100 of the aircraft. Of these, it has already taken delivery of 34 and will take delivery next year of 16 more. BAe, a 20 per cent partner in the Airbus consortium, makes the wings for all Airbus airliners at Chester. Overall, the UK company employs 7,000 people on Airbus work. BAe said last night it was disappointed at the Northwest decision. It said it had been reviewing wing production as a result of deferrals and cancellation of Airbus orders. Airbus said from its headquarters in Toulouse that negotiations were continuing with Northwest over the terms of the cancellations. Northwest is expected to face heavy financial penalties. The US carrier is also delaying, but not cancelling, orders for four Boeing 747-400 jumbo jets and 47 Boeing 757 twin-engine aircraft worth a total of Dollars 2.7bn. It confirmed it would take delivery next year of two Boeing 747s. Both Airbus and Boeing have faced a growing number of cancellations and demands by airlines for delayed deliveries of new aircraft. The manufacturers recently also had to renegotiate and reschedule large orders placed by GPA Group, the troubled Irish aircraft leasing company. The latest cancellations are bound to have an impact on the workload of the Airbus partners which, in addition to BAe, are Deutsche Aerospace, Aerospatiale of France and Casa of Spain. The Northwest cancellations came as part of a big refinancing package at Northwest. This incorporates a one-year secured loan of Dollars 250m, provided by a consortium of lenders including the Dutch airline KLM, Bankers Trust, ABN-Amro Bank, General Electric Credit Corporation and suppliers such as Airbus and United Technologies. There were fears that, had short-term funds not been forthcoming, Northwest would have faced a cash crunch this winter, pushing the heavily-indebted carrier into bankruptcy. In addition to the short-term loan, Northwest's existing lenders have agreed to reschedule Dollars 340m of principal repayment due next year. The airline's unions have pledged wage and benefit concessions worth Dollars 300m a year for a three-year period, although talks are continuing. The carrier secured financing commitments totalling Dollars 730m to cover the 18 aircraft of which it will take delivery in 1993 - the 16 A320s and two Boeing 747-400s. KLM, which acquired a minority stake in Northwest when the US airline was subject to a Dollars 3.65bn leveraged buy-out in 1989 and is contributing Dollars 50m to the Dollars 250m loan, said last night it was looking forward to 'fully realising the benefits of the proposed . . . integration agreement' with the US carrier. This envisages a comprehensive meshing of the airlines' operations. Icahn gives up his control of TWA, Page 21 Design problems plague Qantas sell-off, Page 23</p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (8): Devaluation is overdue - CFA IN PUBLIC, World Bank officials bite their lips at the mention of the CFA franc zone, and the severe economic difficulties of its 13 west and central African member states, In private, they tear out their hair. Fixing their currencies to the French franc and to each other was once a guarantee of low inflation and economic stability for the members - Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo. Now this monetary union is transmitting a recession across the region. Since 1985, the combination of declining commodity prices, lax domestic fiscal and monetary policies and the appreciation of the French franc against the US dollar mean that the CFA group have suffered a huge real exchange rate appreciation of more than 30 per cent as the chart shows. The result was an immediate and sharp loss of competitiveness for exporters from the CFA zone. By 1991, average wages in Senegal, for example, had risen as a proportion of average income to three times the level in Ghana and six times that of Indonesia. The CFA franc is now about 30 per cent overvalued. This loss of competitiveness delivered a downward deflationary spiral in the CFA zone, fed by deflationary macroeconomic policies as countries tried to control the fiscal deficits that this shock opened up. Real output per head in the CFA countries had risen by around 2 per cent in the first half of the 1980s. It fell by an average 5 per cent a year between 1986 and 1991. Neither the French government nor the CFA members are willing to recognise either that the French franc-CFA parity, unbroken since 1948, is at the heart of the crisis or that a substantial CFA devaluation may now be the only way to preserve the zone. Instead, the CFA countries have tried to correct their severe external and fiscal imbalances through fiscal austerity and attempted wage restraint without recourse to devaluation. Most of the group have tried to adopt World Bank-style adjustment programmes in the late 1980s. The results have been disastrous. Battling against an uncompetitive exchange rate, growing capital flight, a powerful and a restive civil service, most of the CFA countries have been unable to meet the demanding macroeconomic and structural targets that internal adjustment demands. The poor have suffered at the expense of the urban elite able, with the help of aid flows, to preserve their purchasing power. In Niger and Chad, the civil service wage bill exceeds total tax revenue. The result is what bank officials call a 'silent crisis'. Inflation is low, there are goods in the shops and civil servants are still being paid. But poverty is rising, the infrastructure decaying: without devaluation combined with tight control on civil service salaries, the crisis will deepen.</p>

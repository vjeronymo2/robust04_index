			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Books: Empty heart of the real Emma Bovary PIONEER FEMINIST, LITERARY STAR, FLAUBERT'S MUSE by Francine du Plessix Grey Hamish Hamilton Pounds 20, 432 pages On his deathbed in 1880, Flaubert screamed out 'I'm dying like a poisoned dog, but that tart Emma Bovary will live forever.' The model and muse for Emma, however, was by then already dead and forgotten. She was Louise Colet, Flaubert's mistress in the 1840s and 50s, and this book is an attempt to give her a place in literary history. They met at her Paris salon when he was an obscure provincial writer and she a famous poetess and beauty whose friends included Victor Hugo and George Sand. Within days, Flaubert and Colet were making love in a hansom cab as it lurched frenetically round Paris - an episode satirised in Madame Bovary, where a grotesquely swaying, darkened cab with Emma and her lover inside it announces their adultery to the town of Rouen. Colet never forgave Flaubert for this travesty; Sartre, reading between the lines of their letters, was certain that Flaubert was impotent in the cab and that the venomous scene in the novel was his revenge for the humiliation. The couple were not well suited. Louise was a flamboyant Provencal who wrote florid verses, loved big city glamour, and once stabbed a critic with a kitchen knife. Like Emma Bovary, she had as a child hidden in the woods to read romantic stories, and she was drenched in the sort of sentimental idealism which was Emma's downfall. By contrast, Flaubert was a cold northerner who lived as a hermit in Normandy with his mother, and cynically rationed their affair according to the progress of Bovary. When he needed inspiration or a detail from Louise's girlhood to flesh out the story, he was the importunate lover. Otherwise, despite her anger and an impromptu visit to his estate - she was turned away at the gate - the relationship was mostly postal. It is from his letters to Louise that we draw a picture of Flaubert's five year ordeal in writing Madame Bovary, and they form a unique record of literary composition. 'One week - two pages'; 'this one inn scene will take me three months' he writes. Life and art merged cruelly. When Louise offered Flaubert a cigar holder inscribed amor nel cor, the motto found its way on to the signet ring Emma gives her lover Rodolphe. As he was imagining Rodolphe's letter of rejection, Flaubert wrote his own, less regretful one, to Louise. She consoled herself with a roman a clef - which made Flaubert 'split his sides laughing' - and with other poet-lovers, including Musset and Vigny. She never lost her grand gestures, and at the end of her life announced that her heart was 'as empty of emotion for Flaubert as Pompeii is of inhabitants.' Francine du Plessix Grey is probably right that Emma was Louise with her blue stockings off - 'a highly sexed narcissist, seldom satisfied with reality, seeking in others a glorified image of herself.' The trouble with this biography is that, as Flaubert knew, such a subject is soon tedious unless mocked - thus the exquisite irony in Madame Bovary. With the invented dialogue and purple reconstructions here, on the other hand, Louise Colet's story reads more like a Mills and Boon of the Paris salons than a literary biography. ''Why Monsieur Flaubert, perhaps it's you who should be my mentor' . . . 'Save for a delectable lunch of shellfish served right in their room . . . Louise and Gustav seem barely to have left their bed'.' Ms du Plessix Grey says she wrote this book 'to reinstate a colleague into the annals of her time . . . to resurrect yet another woman whose memory has been erased by the caprices of men.' To present this kind of kiss 'n tell memoir in feminist colours is preposterous. Gender is not the point: Flaubert is remembered because he wrote a masterpiece, Colet is forgotten because she did not. Her story as presented here is of interest - but only in the context of his.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Some Hungarian Radio employees who have not been  sacked have started a petition for they consider that an  unequivocal political cleansing has taken place in the  institution.    In their opinion, the often mentioned surplus of staff does  not justify the dismissal of prestigious, experienced, and  well-known editors and reporters on the pretext of financial  difficulties and organizational restructuring. These staff  members -- who are unaffected by the dismissals and have joined  the employees' protest -- emphasize that they wish to serve the  radio listeners. Thus they will remain [in the institution] to  carry out the work as long as possible.    They think it important to let everybody know that they  consider these events outrageous. They express their solidarity  with those sacked and they hope that soon they will be able to  work together in Hungarian Radio again.</p>

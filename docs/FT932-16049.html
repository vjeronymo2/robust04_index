			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Wanted: new life for single market THE European Commission believes the single European market could lose momentum and credibility unless new ways are found to build on the achievements of the past seven years. Commissioners spent most of yesterday discussing how to develop the internal market and to boost European business and industry. A spokesman said the Commission was concerned at the way the single market - aimed at easing the movement of people, goods, services and capital across EC frontiers - was no longer seen as an important issue across the Community. Commissioners stressed the first aim was to adopt the few measures outstanding from the original 1985 single market programme, which is 95 per cent complete, and to make sure that what had been adopted was implemented and functioning properly. At the same time, the Community should press for the lifting of remaining controls on travellers at internal EC borders, politically the most sensitive of the single market objectives and the most difficult to achieve. The EC's executive is itself seeking new purpose in the aftermath of the symbolic single market 'deadline' of January 1, 1993.</p>

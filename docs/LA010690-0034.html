			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINANCIAL MARKETS;  </P> <P> DOW FALLS 22.83 ON JOBS REPORT, SOVIET WORRIES  </P> <P> Stock prices declined Friday in the face of economic uncertainties and worries  over political developments in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials fell 22.83 to 2,773.25, reducing its gain  for the week to 20.05 points.  </P> <P> Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading of  New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 591 up, 931 down and 453 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 158.53 million shares, down from 177 million in the  previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues,  including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the  over-the-counter market, totaled 191.73 million shares.  </P> <P> The Labor Department reported that the civilian unemployment rate held steady  at 5.3% in December. The data showed a smaller-than-expected 142,000 increase  in non-farm payroll employment.  </P> <P> Traders in the bond market took that as favorable news, suggesting that the  pace of the economy remained sluggish enough to allow the Federal Reserve to  consider further moves toward easier credit.  </P> <P> But stock market investors evidently read the figures as a sign that further  weakness might be in store for corporate earnings in the months ahead.  </P> <P> Analysts also said the market was unsettled by reports that Soviet leader  Mikhail S. Gorbachev canceled foreign engagements to deal with domestic  problems.  </P> <P> Several European country funds gave up some of their recent gains on the chance  that the Soviet situation might delay or disrupt new trade opportunities in  Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> Germany Fund fell 2 3/4 to 17, posting the day's biggest percentage loss among  NYSE issues; Austria Fund was down 1 1/4 at 20 5/8, and Italy Fund lost 3/4 to  15 1/2.  </P> <P> Malaysia Fund, by contrast, gained 1 3/4 to 21 7/8, and First Philippine Fund  rose 7/8 to 14 3/4.  </P> <P> Regional telephone stocks sold off in a general flow of money out of the  "defensive" issues that gained many followers in late 1989.  </P> <P> Southwestern Bell dropped 3 to 59 1/4; Pacific Telesis fell 1 1/2 to 47 3/4;  Bell South lost 1 7/8 to 55 5/8, and Nynex dipped 1 1/8 to 86 3/8.  </P> <P> Losers among other blue chips included General Electric, down 5/8 at 65 5/8;  Merck, down 1 5/8 at 77; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down 3/4 at 44  5/8, and McDonald's, down 5/8 at 33 1/4.  </P> <P> International Business Machines, which had been rallying from depressed levels  in recent sessions, slipped back 1/4 to 99 3/4.  </P> <P> The reports that Gorbachev had canceled all January meetings sent the Tokyo  share index tumbling as much as 622.37 points, but prices regained part of  their losses by the close. The 225-share Nikkei index tumbled 438.12 points or  1.13% to close at 38,274.76 after falling 202.99 on Thursday.  </P> <P> Share prices finished slightly lower on London's stock exchange. The Financial  Times 100-share index fell 7.1 points to close at 2,444.5.  </P> <P> CREDIT  </P> <P> Bond Prices Tumble Over Inflation Fears  </P> <P> Prices of long-term government bonds sank on new inflation fears and the Labor  Department's report that apparently offered no hope of lower interest rates.  </P> <P> The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond fell 1/4 point, or $2.50 for every  $1,000 in face value. Its yield rose to 8.06% from 8.03% late Thursday.  </P> <P> Shorter-term Treasury yields were mixed.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was  quoted at 8.125%, down from 8.215% late Thursday.  </P> <P> In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal  bonds was 93 1/16, down 1/8. The average yield to maturity rose to 7.28% from  7.27% late Thursday.  </P> <P> CURRENCY  </P> <P> Gold Rises on Events in the Eastern Bloc  </P> <P> The dollar staged a turnaround Friday, closing mostly higher in domestic  dealings after taking a sharp hit in overseas markets that were focusing on  events in Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> Gold prices soared by as much as $9 an ounce. On the Commodity Exchange in New  York, gold bullion for current delivery jumped $7.70 to settle at $406.30 an  ounce. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $406.25  an ounce, up $7.50 from Thursday's late bid.  </P> <P> The news reports that Gorbachev had canceled January appointments with foreign  officials sparked the hike in gold prices and frightened currency markets  worldwide.  </P> <P> "So much depends on him keeping peace in the Eastern Bloc and to give enough  room for progress to continue," said Jack Barbanel, managing director of First  Global Managers in Princeton, N.J.  </P> <P> While foreign markets focused on Gorbachev's political health, domestic traders  keyed in on the Labor Department's unemployment report. The addition of 142,000  non-farm jobs was weaker than expected.  </P> <P> "The dollar dropped off rather sharply on the weak number," said Stephen  Flanagan, a vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. The report gave  further fuel to the argument that the U.S. economy is slowing and that the  Federal Reserve might move to lower interest rates.  </P> <P> Foreign appetite for dollars is dampened when the yields on U.S. securities  decline.  </P> <P> Traders also noted that the Fed entered the market to sell dollars for yen,  pushing the dollar lower against the Japanese currency.  </P> <P> A lower dollar will help ensure "we have some advantage in continuing the level  of exports (to Japan)," which in turn aids in improving the trade deficit,  Barbanel noted.  </P> <P> Despite the negative news, technical factors pushed the dollar higher at the  close of trading.  </P> <P> "The volume was high, and trading was somewhat chaotic," Flanagan said.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 144.15 Japanese yen, from 145.20 yen on Thursday.  Later in London, it fell to 143.75 yen. In New York, the dollar finished at  144.50 yen, up from 143.65 yen on Thursday.  </P> <P> In London, the British pound rose to $1.6375 from $1.6290 late Thursday. In New  York, it cost $1.6350 to buy one pound, unchanged from Thursday.  </P> <P> Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $404.50 an ounce, from $395 bid late  Thursday. In Zurich, Switzerland, the metal rose to a closing bid of $405.50,  from $395.70 bid late Thursday. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $6.03 to close  at a bid $400.92.  </P> <P> Silver prices rose. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery  settled at $5.318 an ounce, from $5.268 an ounce on Thursday. In London, the  metal rose to a late bid price of $5.27 an ounce, from $5.22 bid late Thursday.  </P> <P> COMMODITIES  </P> <P> Heating Oil Futures Continue to Fall  </P> <P> Heating oil futures prices plunged more than 5 cents a gallon for the second  straight day on the New York Mercantile Exchange as warm temperatures in the  Northeast flushed speculators from the market.  </P> <P> On other commodity markets, orange juice futures rebounded strongly; precious  metals were sharply higher; pork futures surged while cattle futures were  mixed, and grains and soybeans were mixed.  </P> <P> Wholesale home heating oil futures settled 2.27 to 5.36 cents lower, with the  contract for delivery in February at 67.83 cents a gallon.  </P> <P> West Texas Intermediate crude oil finished 33 to 58 cents lower, with February  at 23.08 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 2 to 3.07 cents lower, with  February at 62.22 cents a gallon.  </P> <P> Tables begin on D5  </P></p>

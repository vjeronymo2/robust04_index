			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["President Kim Il-song Sends Letter to Delegates to </F> National Conference of Party Cell Secretaries"--KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- The great leader  Comrade Kim Il-song, general secretary of the Central Committee  of the Workers' Party of Korea and president of the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea, sent a letter of congratulations  today to the delegates to the national conference of party cell  secretaries.    President Kim Il-song in the letter said the conference  would  mark an important milestone in strengthening and developing our  party into an unconquerable party and fortifying the bulwark of  socialism in our country, by enhancing the function and role of  the party cells.    He further said:    Our party is a glorious party which has grown up from deep  historical roots. It is a revolutionary party of chuche which,  guided by the chuche idea, struggles for the popular masses'  cause of independence.    The foundation of our party and its development are  inconceivable apart from the development of its cell, the basic  party organization. In view of the cell's very important place  and role in party building and party activities, we have  consistently paid a close attention to strengthening party cells  and other grassroots organizations ever since the days when its  foundation was prepared.    In accordance with the policy adopted at the historic Kalun  meeting in 1930, we conducted the work of founding the party by  forming the basic organizations first and then increasing and  strengthening them. Since its foundation, our party expanded  its ranks by recruiting advanced elements from among workers,  peasants, intellectuals and other working people, and organized  its cells in factories, enterprises, farm villages and in all  other places where there were its members and the masses, and  strengthened the militant function of its cells to meet the  actual requirements at each stage of the revolution. Through  the strengthening of the cells and the enhancement of their  function and role, our party grew into an invincible party which  achieved the unity and cohesion of its ranks on the basis of the  chuche idea and became a harmonious whole with the popular  masses.    In the period when the historic task of modelling the whole  society on the chuche idea came to the fore, our party put great  efforts into the work of cementing its cells to meet the  requirements of a new, higher stage of the revolution. After  the training course held at the proposal of the Central  Committee of the party for the party cell secretaries from all  parts of the country in 1991, a vigorous movement was launched  to create loyal party cells throughout the whole party under the  slogan, "Let us make all the party cells loyal cells ", and  their militant function and role have been enhanced as never  before.    Today, the party cells are performing their noble mission  and  duties with credit in further developing the party into a  revolutionary party of chuche and carrying on and promoting the  chuche revolutionary cause.    The brilliant successes in our party building and in the  development of our revolution are associated with the silent  efforts and exploits of the party cell secretaries. With a high  sense of pride and revolutionary awareness that they are the  junior political workers of the glorious Workers' Party of  Korea, the cell secretaries have devoted their all to the  struggle for the party and the revolution, wishing for neither  honour nor reward.    The most important revolutionary task now facing our party  and our people is to safeguard and defend the people-centred  socialism of our own style from the challenge of the  imperialists and reactionaries and develop it further.    The socialism which has been established in our country by  implementing the chuche idea under our party's leadership is a  genuine socialism which accords with the people's aspirations to  independence. Whether or not we defeat the enemy's manoeuvres,  and defend the socialist cause of chuche and accomplish it  depends on how we strengthen the party, the general staff of the  revolution, and how we enhance its leadership role.    Party cells are the cornerstones of our party as well as the  revolutionary posts which guard our socialism. They are the  base for training party members into revolutionaries and  assimilating them to the working class, the base for linking  party members with its Central Committee and establishing  unbreakable ties between the party and the masses, and the base  for mobilizing its membership and other working people for the  implementation of the party's lines and policies.    Strengthening party cells is precisely an important  guarantee  for increasing the motive force of our party and our revolution  and firmly defending and developing our socialism.    All the party cell secretaries must, with a high sense of  responsibility and honour, train their cells to be unfailingly  loyal to the party, to be militant cells which powerfully  organize the masses for the struggle to defend and develop the  cause of socialism.    The party cells must, above all else, loyally support the  unified leadership of the party Central Committee.    Ensuring the unity of leadership in the party is the  fundamental principle of party activity. Loyally supporting the  undivided leadership of the party Central Committee is the  lifeblood of the party cells.    Today the cause of our party, the chuche revolutionary  cause,  is honourably carried on under the leadership of Comrade Kim  Chong-il who possesses excellent personality and qualities as  the people's leader. Our party has successfully solved the  question of ensuring the continuity of leadership to meet the  requirement of revolutionary development and the desire of the  popular masses. This is the success in which our party can take  the greatest pride in its development; this firmly guarantees a  bright future and a brilliant victory of our party and our  revolution.    All the party cells must keep the main line of effort to  establish the monolithic system of party leadership. The cells  must accept the party's lines and policies, its decisions and  instructions unconditionally and carry them out; they must  educate and lead the party members and other working people to  be unfailingly loyal to party leadership.    Party cells must be efficient in organizing and guiding  the party life of its members.    The party cells must intensify organizational and  ideological  life of the party members to train all of them into staunch  revolutionaries who are unfailingly loyal to the party and the  revolution and can unyieldingly fight for the victory of the  socialist cause in any adversity.    The party cells must improve work among the masses and unite  broad sections of them firmly behind the party.    The party cells must efficiently work among the masses to  give revolutionary education to broad sections of them and rally  them closely behind the party Central Committee and make an  active contribution to strengthening the single-hearted unity of  the whole society.    Party cells must push ahead with the ideological, technical  and cultural revolutions to effect uninterrupted innovations and  upsurge in socialist construction.    Regarding the ideological revolution as their first and  foremost revolutionary task, party cells must intensify  education in the chuche idea among the party members and working  people.    We should bring them to cherish an unfailing loyalty to the  party, staunch revolutionary spirit, unshakable faith in  socialism, ardent patriotism and noble moral traits, and bring  into fuller bloom in our society the beautiful communist  morality of helping and leading each other forward and sharing  weal and woe on the principle of one for all and all for one.    Party cells must make a great effort to carry out the  cultural revolution so that all the party members and working  people learn hard and strive to thoroughly improve their  cultural and technical standards steadily and enjoy to their  hearts' content the socialist cultural life, with rich emotional  feelings and a high cultural attainment.    Party cells must strengthen organizational and political  work  to make sure that the party members and working people  accelerate the technical revolution and make innovations in  building the socialist economy.    For the present the party cells in all sectors of the  national economy must effect a fresh, revolutionary advance in  building the socialist economy by organizing the party members  and working people effectively for the implementation of the  party's revolutionary economic strategy.    Party cells must always pay deep attention to national  defence.    We are striving to build socialism in sharp confrontation  with the enemy. The imperialists and their lackeys are now  daily intensifying military threats and provocations against our  republic, the bulwark of socialism.    Party cells must see to it that the party members and  working  people sharpen their revolutionary vigilance against the enemy's  manoeuvres of aggressive provocation, learn military affairs in  real earnest, and make full preparations for defending the  security of the country and the socialist gains reliably. Party  cells must encourage the party members and working people to  display fully the traditional traits of unity between the army  and the people and ensure that the Army and the people, as one,  defend the socialist motherland firmly.    First, to support the unified leadership of the party  Central  Committee with loyalty, second, to organize and guide party life  effectively to train all the party members into the  revolutionaries of chuche type, third, to do work with the  masses efficiently to strengthen the blood-sealed ties between  the party and the masses, fourth, to expedite the three  revolutions in ideology, technology and culture to promote  socialist construction, and fifth, to defend the security of the  country and the socialist gains reliably--these are the five  major tasks party cells must tackle at present.    All the party cell secretaries must adhere to these five  tasks and carry them out to the letter.</p>

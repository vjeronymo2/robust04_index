			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Letter: No evidence to suggest that credit crunch is greater outside the US Sir, Anthony Harris misrepresents the case I made for remaining sanguine about the credit crunch issue ('Avoiding the crunch questions about credit', April 2). It is not just that bank lending in four major economies - the US, the UK, Japan and Germany - is growing no more slowly than during the last two substantial world economic recessions. Survey data indicate that the decline in the growth rate of US bank lending is still closely related to weaker corporate demand for credit, leaving little room for supply restrictions to explain the slowdown. Federal Reserve data show that the importance of banks as purveyors of credit to the economy has been on a declining trend for 20 years, with other sources such as the commercial paper markets becoming increasingly important. According to the Securities Data Corporation, stock and bond issuance in US markets in the first quarter of this year was at a record high and 30.6 per cent up on a year ago. Elsewhere the evidence is more sketchy, but does not support the view that the crunch is greater outside the US. In any country, there may now be greater-than-normal distress lending by the banks. I do not deny that the corporate sector is facing a severe squeeze, at least in the UK and the US. What would be dangerous now would be for the authorities again to over-compensate for what will turn out to be a temporary period of economic weakness. History is replete with examples of overly expansionary monetary policies, which stoke inflation and do nothing to improve growth over the medium term. This often occurs just when the justification for easy money appears 'special'. Remember the 1987 equity market crash and the need to ease policy aggressively to avoid a global depression in 1988? To argue that the dollar's recent recovery is the result of the Federal Reserve's easy money policies is ridiculous. Since early 1989, US short rates have fallen from 10 per cent to just below 6.5 per cent and the dollar has depreciated by about 15 per cent against the D-Mark, even including a recent rally. It has been the belief that US rates are near a trough that has helped the dollar, not the market's confidence in the policies of Mr Greenspan. The latter will leave the US with the highest inflation rate in the Group of Five industrialised countries by the end of this year. While I cannot speak for all City economists, my employers do not pay me to think like the Bank of England. Jeremy Hale, executive director, Goldman Sachs International, 5 Old Bailey, EC4</p>

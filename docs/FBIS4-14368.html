			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The villages of Zawtar al-Gharbiyah, Zawtar  al-Sharqiyah, Mazra'at al-Hamra', Qa'qa'iyat al-Jisr, and the  al-Litani River basin came under violent and concentrated  shelling by Israeli artillery in al-Zaffat and al-Tayyibah at  1645 this afternoon. The Israeli occupation troops strafed the  forests close to the al-Litani River basin with machine-gun  fire. [passage omitted]    The Islamic Resistance, in a statement released in  al-Nabatiyah this afternoon, announced that the martyr Yusuf  Harb group at 1645 today ambushed a patrol from the Lahd  militias [South Lebanese Army] while passing along the dirt road  between 'Alman and al-Shumariyah. The group members destroyed  an armored personnel carrier and killed and wounded those inside  it. Following the operation, clashes ensued between the  resistance fighters and the patrol members in which various  types of weapons were used.

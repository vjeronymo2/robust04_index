Although U.S. officials expect positive results this time,  the previous experience with Israel has not been encouraging.  Furthermore, since the historic Geneva summit between Presidents  al-Asad and Clinton and the emphasis it placed on a  comprehensive and just solution on all fronts, the Israelis,  represented by their prime minister and their negotiators, have  continued to cast doubts on the results of the summit as well as  Syrian intentions. They then aggravated the situation by  calling for a referendum on the Golan -- as if the Golan is not  occupied Syrian territory that Israel usurped by force in 1967.    Since the end of Geneva summit, observers agreed that the  ball is now in Israel's court since Israel has committed itself  to peace requisites within the framework of a real and honorable  peace. The observers believe that Syria had contributed to the  peace process despite all the obstacles created by Israel.    Likewise, the observers agreed that this referendum game of  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin is nothing but a maneuver  to curb the momentum of the peace process and its requisites.  Throughout history, no occupier had ever conducted a referendum  on a land that does not belong to it. What, then, about the  case of the Golan -- in which UN Resolutions have upheld its  Syrian identity, declared all Israeli measures concerning it  null and void, and urged Israel to fully withdraw from it?    The success of the Washington talks, expected to be held  today, depends on a positive Israeli position devoid of  maneuverability and procrastination. In fact, the UN  resolutions that were adopted as the basis of the peace  settlement in the region do not leave any room for ambiguity.  There is no room for all these Israeli maneuvers on this  subject.    It is true that the negotiations usually face ups and downs,  but there are basic principles that should be respected and  translated into a tangible results, foremost of which is land  for peace. Land does not mean part of the Golan, south Lebanon,  or the West Bank. It means all of the Golan, south Lebanon, and  the West Bank. Security guarantees should be mutual, especially  since Israel is the one that threatens the Arabs, not vice  versa. Had Israel committed itself to these principles, peace  would have prevalent in the region by now.    The Washington talks have always been confronted with  Israel's strange interpretations of Security Council resolutions  and its deceptive concepts of security guarantees. The Arabs,  and the whole world, understand that the Security Council  resolutions mean full withdrawal from the occupied territories.  Israel is speaking about partial and phased withdrawals. The  Arabs understand security as mutual guarantees, and Israel wants  to disarm the Arabs and to add more weapons to its already  lethal arsenal. The Arabs understand peace as just and  comprehensive, one that includes all fronts; Israel wants a  phased peace that will not end occupation and does not lead to  the withdrawal of its aggressive forces. This is the crux of  the problem, and there is no solution to this disagreement  unless Israel bows fully to the resolutions of international  legitimacy and accepts the exchange of all occupied land for  peace.    Syria and all Arabs are looking forward to a real and  honorable peace--the peace of the brave about which President  al-Asad spoke. Al-Asad has asked Israeli leaders to rise to the  level of this peace. The Arabs are engaged in new talks today  out of their faith in peace and they are counting on the  international community taking action on its responsibilities.  Eventually, the Israeli procrastination that has lasted for  more than two years must come to an end.</p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> FIRM FINED FOR DUMPING  </P> <P> Puroflow Corp. last week entered a plea of no contest to charges of illegally  pouring acid wastes down a sewer drain in March, 1989, City Atty. Robert M.  Myers announced.  </P> <P> Santa Monica Municipal Court Judge Rex Minter imposed a fine, penalties and  restitution totaling $67,000 and placed the company on three years' probation.  </P> <P> Myers said the case reaffirms the importance of handling hazardous waste  properly to protect ground water and public health. "Violators will be  aggressively prosecuted," he said.  </P> <P> Puroflow, at 1631 10th Street, manufactures water and fuel filters and valves  for domestic, commercial and aerospace applications.  </P> <P> City officials discovered the illegal dumping after installing monitoring  devices in the sewer main next to Puroflow and in Puroflow's feeder lines. The  devices detected acidic discharges in violation of the state Hazardous Waste  Control Act, they said.  </P></p>

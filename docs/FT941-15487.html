			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: NU writ against Tarmac Norwich Union has issued a writ for damages, understood to be for up to Pounds 80m, against a subsidiary of Tarmac, the construction group, for work on the Galleries shopping centre in Bristol. Tarmac, meanwhile, is claiming more than Pounds 2m in unpaid fees and costs it said it is owed for work on the development. The construction company said it had not had opportunity to analyse details of the writ but it was 'satisfied the group had no material liability in this connection.' Schal International, Tarmac's construction management subsidiary, worked on the project until spring 1991 when it was replaced. The claims by Norwich Union relate to the late opening of the development which is now trading and mostly let. The construction group, which has rejected Norwich Union's claims, told shareholders yesterday that the claims have been reviewed but no agreement has been reached.</p>

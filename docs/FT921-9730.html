			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Le Monde hit by FFr28m loss FRANCE'S independent daily newspaper Le Monde said yesterday it had lost FFr28m (Pounds 2.86m) in 1991 because of a slump in advertising revenue, and could only hope to break even this year, Reuter reports from Paris. Director Jacques Lesourne said that despite a price increase and cuts in staff and running costs the respected evening newspaper lost FFr13m more than forecast. Its loss in 1990 was FFr39m. 'Our aim for 1992 is to break even,' Mr Lesourne wrote. He would be looking for further ways of saving money without sacrificing quality or increasing the cover price.</p>

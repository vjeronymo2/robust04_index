			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Arts: Bartoli and Vollestad - Wigmore Hall recitals As a Rossini mezzo, Miss Bartoli is more or less perfect. That was a good enough reason for devoting her whole Wigmore Hall recital on Sunday to Rossini. She had the enterprise and taste to stick to proper recital-songs, too, until her dazzling 'Bel raggio lusinghier' (Semiramide) at the very end. (Her second encore was operatic too, and delivered with no less brilliant finesse: 'Tanti affetti', from La donna del lago.) Though Rossini's songs with piano are without exception charming, a programme given over to them may seem like a menu consisting entirely of hors d'oeuvres. Usually his little three-part cantata, or monodrama, 'La regata veneziana' - a regular favourite despite its tricky Venetian dialect  -stands out just because of its length, amid all those pretty miniatures which are over within two or three minutes. Here the Bartoli impersonation of excitable Anzoleta, urging her gondolier on to victory, was sly and delectable; but she found whole little worlds of feeling elsewhere, even in the shortest songs. The voice is lovely, softly burnished and phenomenally flexible (and accurate). With Bartoli Rossini's endless fioriture, which require some acrobatic effort from most modern singers and may easily sound like period-routine, become expressive elaborations of the most natural kind, easy and delicate. Were they not so exquisite, they would seem almost artless. We got a virtuoso display of them in five different settings of the same verse, 'Mi lagnero tacendo' - one of them in quintuple time] - each with its own unique inflections, tender or wounded or nobly reproachful. What crowns Miss Bartoli's art in Rossini, however, is her irrepressible sense of humour. It glints mischievously through most of her singing: it is funny for a voice to be going through all those intricate hoops, and she shares the joke with us. Particularly infectious was her treatment of Cerere's aria from an obscure cantata, which began with goddess-like frowns, melted into beatific satisfaction and finally went into exultant whoops. Almost a send-up; but faultlessly musical, and bewitching to hear. For her first encore she switched to Mozart, the 'Voi che sapete' from Figaro, offering it like the formal serenade which dramatically it is (Cherubino's well-rehearsed song to the Countess) - quite steady, beautifully liquid, without any effusive Viennese sentiment but subtly shaded at the edges. Coming between her triumphant 'Bel raggio' and 'Tanti affetti', it was doubly affecting. ***** It was the encores on Tuesday that brought out the best in a young Norwegian baritone at his Wigmore Hall recital. For those who have invested in the music of the 'Tender is the North' festival, there is the dividend of catching some of the most promising Scandinavian singers of the younger generation. Per Vollestad made his recital debut in 1986 and has won good opinions for his song recordings since then. With music ranging from Grieg and Rangstrom to standard Schubert and Schumann (the Op. 24 Liederkreis) this programme was a decent showcase for his talents. Those include a friendly stage manner and a fairly strong, dark-hued baritone, which is shy about its top - when top notes beckoned, he offered a variety of ideas for how not to sing out. There was nothing coy, however, about his delivery of Grieg's Op. 48. Earlier indecisiveness was dispelled and these songs, set to German poetry including Heine and Goethe, were sung in a way that showed they have a grip on their texts, suggesting a more intellectual Grieg than we have met in the series so far. Vollestad's Rangstrom songs worked well, too. 'Melodi' proved a real charmer, for which the singer can take some credit.</p>

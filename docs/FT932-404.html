			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Letter: Identity no substitute for mission Sir, I want to take issue with Mr Ahlstrom's letter ('Mission in need of more than written message', June 18) linking mission and corporate identity. He states that companies, particularly those with little physical presence such as 'City organisations', need a clear 'corporate identity' to help communicate their missions. 'The company must not only sound as though it knows where it is going, it must also look it.' Research at the Ashridge Strategic Management Centre has led us to a rather different conclusion. If an organisation has a mission, if the people in the organisation have a sense of mission about what they are trying to do and how they are going about doing it, that mission will be plain for all to see. Mission statements and corporate identities will be redundant. If the people do not have a sense of mission, no amount of corporate identity can compensate. Using a clear corporate identity to mask the lack of a shared sense of mission will not work. Andrew Campbell, director, Ashridge Management Centre, 17 Portland Place, London W1N 3AF</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The State Duma passed a federal law on state foreign  debts and Russia's credits granted to foreign states in the  first hearing Wednesday.    The draft law provides for an annual setting by a federal  law  of the maximum volume of credits used within a fiscal year and  representing part of Russia's foreign debt. The maximum volume  of foreign loans taken by the state shall not exceed the annual  volume of payments in service and repayment of Russia's foreign  debt.    The draft law envisions that Russia's international treaties  on state loans and Russia's state credits to foreign states are  subject to ratification whenever they exceed 100 million dollars.    The State Duma also passed a federal law on the maximum  volume of state loans and Russia's state credits to foreign  states in 1994 Wednesday.    According to the law, the maximum volume of Russia's loans  in  1994 is set at 4.7 billion dollars, while Russia's credits to  foreign states in 1994 at 400 million dollars.    The two federal laws were sent for consideration by the  Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian parliament.</p>

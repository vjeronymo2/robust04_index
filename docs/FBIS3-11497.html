			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 21 Mar (NA) -- U.S. Vice President  Albert Gore's presence in Argentina has escalated controversy on  the approval of a law on the protection of intellectual rights  on pharmaceutical patents and has awakened the local  laboratories that insisted on championing their interests.    Representatives from Argentine laboratories, the Argentine  Industrial Center of Pharmaceutical Laboratories (CILFA), and  foreign laboratories, the Chamber of Pharmaceutical Specialties  [Camara de Especialidades Medicinales] (CAEME) have agreed in  rejecting the possibility that the U.S. Government will apply  sanctions against our country if an official bill, scheduled for  discussion in Congress, is not promulgated before 30 April.    In remarks to NA, Felix Rozanski of the Studies Center for  the Development of the Argentine Chemical-Pharmaceutical  Industry [Centro de Estudios para el Desarrollo de la Industria  Quimico Farmaceutica Argentina] (CEDIQUIFA), a CAEME member,  noted: "Argentina will faithfully abide by the agreements signed  before. Therefore, it is totally out of context to talk about  sanctions -- which are the last step in negotiations, not the  first."    Rozanski stressed that Gore "is coming to build, not to  fight." He added that he does not believe "in the magic 30 April  deadline."    In remarks to NA, CILFA President Pablo Challu emphasized  that he does not believe the United States will place sanctions  on our country. He accused the foreign laboratories of  "formally" asking the U.S. Government to apply measures against  local manufacturers.    Challu noted that the Clinton administration's sanctions  might involve limiting exports from other sectors not involved  in the controversy.    Challu believes the selected deadline is not imaginary  because the 117 countries that approved the GATT agreement will  sign it in April. The definition by the U.S. organization UCTR  [expansion unknown] of the implementation of trade pressure  measures also becomes due in April.    In this exchange of accusations, Rozanski stressed that "a  small group of families and courtly entrepreneurs ill advise"  government officials and legislators and prevent the official  bill, scheduled for discussion in Congress, from being approved.    Nevertheless, Rozanski expressed hopes Argentina's current  policy will remain faithful to all the bilateral negotiations  and agreements achieved with the U.S. Government. He stressed:  "The delay is inconsistent."    Rozanski charged: "The parties benefiting from the current  system, namely a few families, are distributing unclear  information and implementing a strong lobby [preceding word in  English] to prevent the bill's approval."    Rozanski noted that the bill's approval will encourage  exports. He pointed out that CILFA "is passing the ball,  ignoring treaties already signed."    Rozinski emphasized that even though the patents law  "represents a precondition for Argentina's entry into NAFTA and  urges the patents law's discussion, it is important for our  country to respect commitments entered before."    CILFA prepared itself for the possible "onslaughts" that may  be prompted by Al Gore's arrival this week with a paid  advertisement that was published today by our country's main  morning newspapers.    In it, CILFA asks U.S. Ambassador James Cheek "not to  invalidate signed agreements."    In this exchange of accusations of lobbies [preceding word  in  English] and influences, Challu indicated that 117 countries  reached agreement on intellectual rights within the Uruguay  Round of GATT. He pointed out that these measures "are the ones  we must respect."    Challu stressed: "There are two basic differences: First,  the  GATT guidelines establish a 10-year transition period for the  implementation of any rules and regulations."    Despite all these urgent considerations, Congress has not  yet  decided on this issue and not even the most optimistic believe  the official bill will be discussed before 10 April.    Both Ambassador Cheek and Foreign Ministry sources admitted  that the approval of this law represents a basic step for  Argentina's entry into NAFTA.</p>

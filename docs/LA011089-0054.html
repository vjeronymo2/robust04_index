			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Veteran Hollywood photographer Murray Garrett can name-drop with the best of  them: Marlon Brando, Gary Cooper, Bette Davis, Kirk Douglas, Joan Crawford,  Betty Grable, Tyrone Power, Jane Russell, Lana Turner and Loretta Young. He  photographed these and many other celebrities during a 27-year career  (1946-73), and his portraits of familiar faces are on display (through Feb. 17)  at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills. His first  assignment in 1942 (when he was 16) was to photograph Eleanor Roosevelt.  "Things were different then and photographers weren't enemies," says Garrett.  "I had the good fortune of becoming friendly with these people, and they  trusted me." ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

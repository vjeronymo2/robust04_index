			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Party of the Democratic Left Chairman Peter </F> Weiss by Julius Gembicky; place and date not given: "The Policy  of Subversion Is Destroying Slovakia"]    [Text] At a recent meeting in Spisska Nova Ves of Movement  for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] supporters, Sergej Kozlik,  deputy chairman of the governing movement, cast doubts on the  "erroneous" voting of two reputable individuals--L. Pittner and  P. Weiss. We interviewed Party of the Democratic Left [SDL]  Chairman Peter Weiss and sought a response to this statement.    [Gembicky] Suggestions have also been made in connection  with the statement by the deputy prime minister that, in the  wake of the Slovak National Party [SNS], there could also be a  split, provoked from the outside, within the SDL. Do you think  they are realistic?    [Weiss] Such statements testify to the lack of  matter-of-fact arguments and the political uncertainty arising  from the ratio of votes in parliament--75:75. They also testify  to the political methods that are part and parcel of the  HZDS--that is, it gains a serious partner not on the basis of a  political agreement but by indulging in deception, bringing  discredit, engaging in corruption, exerting pressure, and  causing disintegration. However, the gentlemen from the HZDS  are mistaken if they think they will succeed in breaking up our  party the way they did the SNS--by corruption that even the  nationalists' representatives themselves did not try to hide.  We did not enter into politics with grand slogans only to swap  them at the appropriate moment for lucrative posts for a few  months.    [Gembicky] What is the fundamental difference between your  own and the government's draft amendment to the law on large  privatization? Is a compromise between the two drafts possible?    [Weiss] During the talks with HZDS representatives, we  strove to ensure that the rational core of the government draft  amendment would be enhanced in the Privatization Committee by  utilizing the new elements from our draft in the new version of  the law that would be submitted by the group of deputies. Thus,  there would be no need to comment on each version of the draft  law. This version, which was drafted by Mr. Tomecko and J.  Plesnik, has been prepared, but the HZDS rejected this course of  action. One obstacle, apart from other problems, is that the  privatization minister and the president of the National  Property Fund [FNM] are one and the same person and that the  finance minister and the chairman of the FNM Supervisory Council  are also one and the same. The fact that the government does not  want to pull back from this concentration of power is an  indication of its unequivocal intention to carry out  privatization on the basis of political criteria. If the  government draft law on large privatization is approved, there  is a risk that it will become infested with corruption.  Privatization will not be sufficiently under the supervision of  either parliament or the public. The result could be such a  structure of owners--and also their interlinking to the state  administration--that it would take a whole generation for us to  extricate ourselves from such a social mechanism. Therefore,  the HZDS deputies who raise their hands in favor of this  amendment will bear an extraordinary, perhaps historical,  responsibility. If ownership relations in this country are  changed by such a method, the kind of political regime I am  concerned about will evolve here.    [Gembicky] There is also anxiety among the leadership of  your party that, when important decisions are being made in  parliament, the coalition could put pressure on you via the  issue of returning the former Communist Party of Slovakia's  property. Is this anxiety warranted?    [Weiss] Representatives from the Christian Social Union came  out with the first wave of speculation. There is no reason for  me, as the party chairman, to be anxious about anything. I have  never done anything at variance with the law. This is a purely  legal dispute. We proceed from the fact that it is absurd to  interpret the resolution of the former Federal Government and  Constitutional Law No. 496/90 in such a way that we should again  return what we have already handed over to the state. It will  merely depend on the proper course of action by the state  bodies. If anyone succumbs to the illusion that it is possible  to exert pressure on the SDL due to this case, he is gravely  mistaken.    [Gembicky] What do you think of the scenario put forward by  the government coalition, a scenario that envisages, first, the  approval of a new agenda, proposed by it, for the National  Council of the Slovak Republic [NR SR], then the approval of a  law on deputies, and, finally, the approval of a constitutional  law on the transfer to a chancellory or presidential system?    [Weiss] We have seen how the HZDS leadership has managed to  discipline and tame the SNS Deputies' Club. Its fundamental  objective could consist of a return to the old idea of adopting  a retroactive law according to which those who had resigned from  their original deputies' clubs or had founded independent clubs  would have to leave parliament, and substitute deputies would  take their place. This would restore the ratio of forces that  existed in parliament in January 1993, and only one or two votes  would be missing for a constitutional majority. The beauty of  this is also that the law would be valid only from 1 January  1993 and that it would not extend back to 1992, when two  independent deputies also "appeared." However, it would affect  the Knazkoites [supporters of Alliance of Slovak Democrats  Chairman Milan Knazko] or, as the case may be, the Cernakites  [supporters of SNS Chairman Ludovit Cernak]. If only one or two  votes were lacking for a constitutional majority, the methods  tried and tested with the SNS would begin to be utilized. Then,  if 90 votes were obtained in the NR SR, it would be possible to  initiate a constitutional change, perhaps not for a chancellory  but directly for a presidential system. I personally do not  consider this scenario to be likely because its implementation  would testify to the catastrophic level of the legal knowledge  of those deputies who would vote for such a retroactive law.    [Gembicky] Realistically, however, what could stand in the  way of this idea being put forward?    [Weiss] Respect for the principles of a law-governed state.  Let us not punish the deputies who resigned from the HZDS Club  or other clubs, even though we may have a different political  and moral view of this, for something that was not at variance  with the valid law when they did it.    [Gembicky] Would the SDL also be willing to cooperate with  the SNS National Democratic Club in the event the extraordinary  assembly in Zilina drives its members into the opposition?    [Weiss] It is never good to exclude anyone from cooperation  in advance. If the situation referred to in your question  arises, this will depend primarily on the club's program and on  its specific political stances.    [Gembicky] From your point of view, what do you think of the  recommendation made by the president to form a broad government  coalition, and what is your reaction to the firm rejection of  this idea by the HZDS district assemblies? For example, do you  agree with their demands for the resignations of M. Zemko and P.  Demes from the Office of the President? What do you say to  their challenge that the deputies from the independent club give  up their deputies' mandates in favor of the HZDS?    [Weiss] All of the demands made at the HZDS district  assemblies are an expression of the governing movement's  dominant social character. This movement is, more and more  obviously, dividing into two streams. A stronger and therefore  more dominant stream and a weak stream. This dominant stream,  from which eight deputies have distanced themselves by their  resignations from the movement, is made up of people who  perceive politics as an instrument for satisfying their egoistic  group or personal interests. These people, although they are  often not up to their jobs, in fact comprise the most intrinsic  part of the state administration and are "attached" to  privatization projects. Therefore, they have an absolutely  natural interest in boosting the power of the HZDS and, if  possible, power that they would not have to share with anyone.  These people are allergic to all supervision and to criticism of  their course of action. They are assuming the right to  determine who has an opinion or who must not have one. They are  assuming the right to tell the president who he can and cannot  have in his office merely because they have a personal aversion  to someone or because they disagree with his political views.  These elements of political impropriety, which we made  substantial use of in the far-off times of the former regime,  are incongruous in a democratic society and will increase  tension and arouse anxiety about where the HZDS is heading.    [Gembicky] Despite what you have said about the HZDS, there  are reports directly from the prime minister's circle that he  has been successfully working on 15 SDL deputies who would  support the HZDS at a critical moment. Five of them apparently  are even supposed to be sure things. Do you know anything about  such fishing in your territorial waters?    [Weiss] The prime minister more and more evidently is  relying not on the quality of his economic policy and his good  image abroad, but on destabilizing other deputies' clubs. I  know that such attempts are being made against the SDL. Our  deputies have told me this. However, the SDL is made of  different stuff than part of the SNS, which fell apart under  well-known circumstances. We are not intellectually or morally  as bad as some people would like to think.    The policy based on subversion and disintegration is  destroying Slovakia. Those who rely on it, like the proverbial  drowning man clutching at a straw, may, in the end, become  victims of it themselves.</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Nomura vacates floor of Tokyo headquarters NOMURA Securities, Japan's largest broking house, is abandoning a floor of its stock and bond trading headquarters in the heart of Tokyo's business centre. The building also houses the Tokyo branches of Salomon Brothers and Barclays de Zoete Wedd. The move is a part of a cost-cutting programme led by a task force officially set up yesterday. Nomura also plans to cut 2,000 jobs over the next five years by paring back new recruits and reducing computer investment costs by 60 per cent. Japan's brokerages face sharp falls in profits due to the prolonged slump of the Tokyo stock market. With daily average volume failing to recover from around 300m shares during the first three months of the fiscal year which started in April, officials reckon operating profits at Japanese brokers have plunged into the red. Other leading brokers are expected to follow Nomura with restructuring plans. Daiwa Securities said that while it had no official programme, it reduced headquarters personnel in February by moving staff to its domestic branches, and expected to cut recruitment by up to 40 per cent. Nikko Securities said it was considering a rationalisation plan. Nomura will cut recruitment of female employees, who serve as assistants and secretaries, to 400 from the usual 800, and will reduce investment in new computer systems to Y4bn (Dollars 32m) from Y10bn.</p>

			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / The Treasury's desire to save, save, save: There is a renewed determination to tighten the reins on public spending AFTER the great binge of the past five years, public spending is facing a crunch. The backdrop is the government's determination to regain control of this huge element of activity - amounting to some 43 per cent of total UK output  -to arrest the steep deterioration in public-sector finances since the late 1980s. In confidential Whitehall discussions, Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, will aim to keep spending in the financial year starting next April within the Treasury's Pounds 245bn planning target set out in the Budget. He is likely to press hard for savings or only small growth in key areas such as education, transport, defence and health. The government believes its comfortable general election victory provided a new mandate to rein back state spending. It hopes that this will, in the longer term, provide room for tax cuts and an expansion in private industry. Nonetheless the ambitious and capable Mr Portillo faces some formidable obstacles. The lingering impact of the recession will for some time push up social security payments - accounting for almost a third of all spending - and put pressure on tax revenues. Also, the chief secretary will have to contend with the hidden demands for spending that may have been triggered by the commitment by Mr John Major, the prime minister, to efficient public services supported by the Citizen's Charter. As Mr Portillo focuses on paring back the bids for extra spending for the three years from 1993-94 that Whitehall departments began submitting to the Treasury earlier this month, he will ponder these factors: The spending record: On present plans, total public spending as measured in current-year prices and including self-financed local-authority spending and debt interest will increase in the five years to 1993-94 by 57 per cent. In the five years before this - between 1983-84 and 1988-89 - outlays increased by only 27 per cent. Slide into deficits: While spending has raced away, tax revenues have been hit by the recession that started around mid 1990. The Treasury expects receipts to increase by just 30 per cent in the five years to 1993-94. In the previous five years, when economic growth was relatively high, revenues expanded by 46 per cent. These changes explain why the UK moved from a small surplus on public-sector finances in 1990-91 to a public-sector borrowing requirement this financial year that will probably be more than Pounds 30bn. Treasury forecasts: The Treasury underestimated the seriousness of the recession, and therefore its impact on public-sector finances. In March 1990, it said Britain would repay Pounds 3bn of debt in 1991-92. In the event, the UK had to borrow nearly Pounds 14bn. The next set of Treasury forecasts, along with the agreed spending figures for the three years from next April, will be announced by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in the Autumn Statement. Future growth: Many economists are predicting a slow recovery this year, but it seems unlikely that growth will be high enough to reduce the PSBR by very much. The Treasury, which predicts growth of 1 per cent this year - at the top end of City projections - reckons that the PSBR in 1993-94 will be Pounds 32bn. Mr Bill Martin, chief UK economist at the Swiss-owned bank UBS Phillips &amp; Drew and a noted sceptic about recovery, thinks next year's deficit will be Pounds 38bn. Financial markets: Efforts by Mr Portillo to trim the deficits will win the support of gilt-edged securities market. The market is worried that, should the deficits continue to rise, the Treasury may find it difficult to finance them through gilt sales. Pruning the deficits will also make it easier for Britain to meet the tough guidelines on public-sector finances set out in the Maastricht agreement on European monetary union - assuming that the accords survive. Scope for cuts: Defence, which accounts for about 10 per cent of all spending, will be a candidate for cuts, as will be spending on roads and public transport. Another - highly sensitive - idea might be to investigate how to trim social security spending by better targeting of benefits. Efficiency savings: The Treasury hopes recent policy initiatives on health - such as making individual hospitals and family practitioners responsible for budgets - will lead to better-quality service without the sort of budget increases seen in recent years. Citizen's Charter: It is an open question whether the emphasis on making public services more orientated to consumer needs will increase demand for spending. While the Treasury resists the notion that the Citizen's Charter is an excuse for higher spending, some believe that public-service efficiency could be helped in the longer term by a large increase in investment - for instance in new government buildings that consume less energy - which might push up the PSBR early on. Wages: Good news for Mr Portillo is that inflationary pressures are likely to be weak in the next year or so, due to the recession and the pound's membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. As a result, the government may be able to limit annual rises in public-sector pay - which account for roughly 40 per cent of the public-spending bill - to low figures in the region of 3 per cent to 4 per cent. Long-term public spending trends: Mr Portillo may consider building on some of the work in this field at the Treasury in the early 1980s, which focused on such questions as the implications on health spending of technological developments and demographic changes. However, ministers would first have to reconsider Whitehall's traditionally secretive approach to examining public spending, with a view to sparking a more public debate.</p>

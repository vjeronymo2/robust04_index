			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Natalya Kalashnikova: "Negotiations Between </F> Russia and the IMF: The IMF Has Not Closed the Door"]    [Text] Yesterday, the last day of the negotiations  between the IMF mission headed by executive director Michel  Camdessus, was the busiest in terms of the number of meetings.  In the morning Mr. Camdessus went to Tsentrobank to see Viktor  Gerashchenko: They resumed discussion of the basic provisions of  the statement from the Russian Government and Central Bank  concerning economic policy for 1994. The director also visited  the State Duma, where behind closed doors he discussed with  speaker Ivan Rybkin the legislative support for the economic  transformations in Russia. Even yesterday during the day, in the  judgments of participants in the negotiations, the positions of  the parties were fairly far from compromise. And it was not  until near 2200 during the course of discussion that Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Michel Camdessus seemed to see  a light at the end of the tunnel.    The negotiations continued all day in various Moscow  offices.  But fears that differences regarding the conditions for granting  Moscow the second part of the systemic credit of $1.5 billion  would not be surmounted remained right up until evening. The  only hope was for the meeting between Mr. Camdessus and Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who had returned from Sochi. These  negotiations began much later than planned. Tied up in traffic  on the Moscow streets, Camdessus did not arrive at the meeting  until 2000, and it lasted almost until midnight. Judging from  preliminary information--not in vain. As KOMMERSANT-DAILY  learned, the parties managed to remove a number of fundamental  obstacles and establish in a joint statement the intention of  the IMF to grant Russia the second part of the credit for a  systemic transformation in the near future.    But the word "impasse" did not leave the lips of the Russian  participants in the negotiations during all the subsequent days.  The fact is that the IMF had doubts about the feasibility of the  draft of the Russian budget for this year and also the  possibility that the State Duma would approve it in this form.  It was the 10 percent deficit which, in the opinion of IMF  experts, might be increased even more after emotional discussion  in parliament, that became the most disputed issue. The IMF had  doubts, in particular, about a number of revenue items totalling  20 trillion rubles [R]. Because of these doubts the Fund even on  Friday was inclined to put off granting the systemic credit. And  although IMF experts admitted that Russia had met one of the  main conditions--reducing inflation (to 16-18 percent per  month)--Mr. Camdessus again recommended that the Ministry of  Finance "reduce inflation and streamline production." Such  admonitions are not new. Nor is Camdessus' statement to the  effect that the path to raising the standard of living of the  Russians lies not through preserving the present model of  production but through its growth. And to do this it is  necessary to reduce and then stop issuing money to cover the  budget deficit. Any financial support for an enterprise, in the  opinion of the IMF chief, should depend on its capabilities of  making production either produce income or operate with minimum  losses.    Even if we keep in mind that Camdessus was only engaging in  standard rhetoric, we can still assume that this time the IMF  was taking a stricter approach to Russia than, for example, it  did last spring. Then, as we know, the government also submitted  for the Fund's consideration a program which, in the assessment  of Russian experts, was not very different from this one but  (this time in the opinion of experts of the IMF itself) fully  met the requirements for including Moscow in the program for  structural transformation. And in July Russia received the first  half of the credit that is the subject of so many disputes in  Moscow now. Nor is it out of place to recall the very practice  of granting this kind of credit. Kazakhstan was the first to  receive it. Now the republic has already been promised an even  larger injection--through the standby credit line--and the IMF  requirements for this credit are even stricter. And it would be  difficult to assume that the course of the reforms in that same  Kazakhstan are ahead of the Russian ones. Therefore granting  credit to Russia would point to the idea of the existence of a  double standard in the IMF.    [First Box, page 3] The basic scenario for economic and  social development of Russia for 1994 (according to information  from the Ministry of Economics of Russia):    --The budget deficit is projected in the range of 10 percent  of GNP. The rate of inflation by the end of the year will  decrease to 7-9 percent per month. The average annual exchange  rate for the ruble is expected to be about R3,000 for $1.    --The decline of industrial production will slow to 10-12  percent of the 1993 level. The reduction of GNP will be about 8  percent.    --Preferential credit for industry and agriculture will be  limited. The system for granting tax and customs benefits,  subsidies, and preferences will be revived. Preferential credit  will be granted only for carrying out highly effective  investment and conversion plans on a competitive basis.    --It is planned to reform state enterprises, to make changes  in the practice of privatization, to provide for a selective  structural-investment policy, and to implement a program for  reconstruction of inefficient enterprises with the removal  (bankruptcy) of the least promising ones.    --The growth of consumer prices is projected to be within  the  range of 4.7-5.2-fold. [end box]    [Second Box, page 3]  <H5>  Commentary </H5>   From a formal standpoint the initially strict position of  the  IMF executive director is quite logical. So-called credit for  purposes of systemic transportation is granted by the Fund as  support for countries that are trying to increase the  effectiveness of their economies according to principles of a  free market and private property. Historically, this support  goes back to the times of the postwar partition of the world  among competing military blocs and the struggle between the  liberal West and the communist system created in the USSR.  Therefore international financial organizations are  traditionally uneasy about the practice whereby national  governments of recipient countries use methods that recall the  economic policy of communist parties. In particular, all kinds  of state support for inefficient productions (especially those  that are state-owned) which leads to growth of the expenditure  part of the budget and the lack of a clear anti-inflation policy  are regarded as a violation of the fundamental principles of the  activity of the IMF. A key role in evaluating the intentions of  one government or another is played by the so-called Memorandum  of Intentions and an analysis of the financial policy of this  government, based primarily on an analysis of its budget  practice. In other words the national government must prove to  the IMF its resolve to undertake market reforms. All this is  fairly difficult for representatives of Russia at the present  time.    First of all, until the next special memorandum concerning  economic policy or at least an agreement between the government  and the Central Bank for the forthcoming year is signed, the  situation with the Russian budget is unclear to the IMF. During  the process of preparing its draft, in just one week its revenue  part increased by almost one-third (from R90 trillion to R120  trillion). The planned budget deficit is approaching 10 percent  of GNP, and from statements from the government it is impossible  to draw the conclusion that its goal is consistent reduction of  it. The prospects for discussion of the budget in the State Duma  make Fund specialists suspicious that after this the expenditure  part will increase even more.    Nevertheless it seems that the main problem in the current  stage of relations between the IMF and the Russian Government is  not so much what is to be done next as how it is to be done. It  has always been clear to the Fund leadership and international  experts that any budget projections, any joint statements in  Russia are either not fulfilled or are successfully evaded. But  in the past the Russian Government has always demonstrated its  desire to "persuade" international financial circles of its firm  adherence to strict financial economy. And this is what is  required of it now: Swallowing the "national pride of the great  Russians," it is necessary to demonstrate this aspiration anew.  And the IMF will close its eyes again because international  financiers are most afraid of accusations that it is because of  their intractability that the West lost Yeltsin.

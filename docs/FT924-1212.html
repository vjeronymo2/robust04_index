			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / EC and US in new push for Gatt accord THE European Community and the US last night sought to inject new momentum into the stalled Uruguay Round of world trade talks by setting a January 15 target for agreement on the main outstanding issues at Geneva. The joint decision was conveyed to Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, at the end of the EC-US summit in Washington. President George Bush, who hosted the talks with Britain's prime minister, Mr John Major, and Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, said both sides now were firmly committed to early conclusion of the Round. Earlier, there had been signs in Washington and Brussels that neither side was willing to force the pace of negotiations before the inauguration of President-elect Bill Clinton next month. But a senior member of the British delegation said there was now a real prospect that the main obstacles in Geneva could be settled at the high-level negotiating meeting set for January 15. Preliminary bargaining will restart in Geneva 11 days earlier, with the negotiators given what the British official termed 'the clearest possible instructions at political level.' Mr Major, who was instrumental in settling the US-EC farm trade row which had held up the Uruguay Round, was also heartened by the backing of Mr Clinton for accelerated negotiations. In a phone conversation with Mr Major, the president-elect gave his backing to the new target date. Mr Major took the opportunity to urge Mr Clinton not to listen to calls for the US to withdraw Most Favoured Nation trading status from China. MFN is seen by the prime minister as crucial to the prosperity of Hong Kong. Senior British officials said that, in the Gatt talks with Mr Bush, the US acknowledged that all sides would have to give ground in Geneva if the Uruguay Round was to be settled. Mr Delors has accused Washington of blocking an accord by refusing to compromise. But the US indicated it would reconsider its objections to the latest draft agreement on the proposed Multilateral Trade Organisation, designed to ensure multilateral arbitration of trade disputes. The US side also showed signs of movement over other outstanding disputes, which include differences over industrial tariffs and trade in services. The British officials said Mr Major was now confident a deal could be struck on the creation of the MTO, on the linked issues of market access and tariffs, and on intellectual property rights. The EC had rejected a US suggestion that yesterday's summit should include detailed bargaining on outstanding bilateral issues, so the multilateral procedures at Geneva could not be circumvented. Mr Delors, who criticised the US for not responding in Geneva to the concessions that the Community had made to resolve the farm trade dispute, attacked the decision by Washington to impose countervailing duties on imports of European steel. His officials said that the calculations on which the duties were based did not take into account the sharp reduction of EC steel subsidies over the past three years.</p>

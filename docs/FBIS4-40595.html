			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Solton from "Today's World" program] </F>   [Text] The UN Security Council began to discuss the U.S.  draft resolution calling for sanctions on Korea because it  rejected the international inspection of its nuclear sites and  withdrew from the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA].  Station commentator Solton writes as follows.    Pyongyang still has a chance to avoid sanctions. This is  possible if Korea changes its present position of encouraging  suspicion that it already has a nuclear weapon or intends to  have one.    The Moscow proposal for the convocation of a multilateral  meeting is producing results. This meeting will be able to  prevent sanctions. The international meeting can formulate  measures for effective steps that will safeguard the sovereignty  and security of the North and the South on one hand, and ensure  the nonnuclear status of the Korean peninsula on the other hand.    Pyongyang and many other countries admit the appropriateness  of the meeting, but the Korean action, particularly the  withdrawal from the IAEA, leads people to suspect that it is  leading to the North's withdrawal from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty. If this is true, the international  community has no alternative but to resort to sanctions. This  development is very disadvantageous. Russian Foreign Minister  Kozyrev agrees.    The resolution is to contain such measures as an arms  embargo, restriction of financial transactions, and suspension  of UN assistance. Yet even if this resolution is adopted, the  sanctions will be taken not at one stroke but step by step.    Pyongyang has time to prove to all people that its nuclear  project is peace-oriented. Wielding weapons affecting not only  Pyongyang, but Washington and Seoul as well, can bring about  consequences seriously aggravating the situation on the Korean  peninsula and the entire Northeast Asian region .</p>

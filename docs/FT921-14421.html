			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Seton to sell US subsidiary Seton Healthcare Group has agreed to sell SePro Healthcare, its US subsidiary. The medical and sports equipment group said that to benefit fully from developments in the US health market, it would need a sales force outside the hospital market. However, it had decided that SePro could not undertake this development cost-effectively on its own, and it would be better to concentrate management resources on the many opportunities in the UK. Tecnol Medical Products will acquire SePro's Warm'N Form and Ice Bag product ranges for about Dollars 2.75m, (Pounds 1.5m) of which Dollars 900,000 will be paid to the former owners of Warm N' Form in lieu of outstanding payments under a previous agreement. Acme United Corporation will acquire the remaining healthcare assets for Dollars 4.35m, payable over seven years. Acme, which already distributes Seton's range of wound dressings, will acquire the US rights for several of Seton's other UK manufactured product ranges for an initial Dollars 2.5m, part of which will be satisfied by a small stake in Acme.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Argentina's floodwater damage revised to Dollars 400m FLOODWATERS NOW cover about half of the arable land in the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina's prime farming region, according to government officials. The heaviest rainfall in the province's recorded history has flooded some 4m hectares of farmland, cut off towns and villages, and washed roads away. Officials estimate the damage at about USDollars 400-500m. Earlier this week, the government said it was Dollars 100m (Pounds 64.9m). Most of the damage has been concentrated in the north-west and south-west of the province, but waters are now slowly spreading across the flat Pampas to the south-east. Mr Felipe Sola, federal agriculture and fisheries secretary, said yesterday that much of the province's soyabean output had been lost. He added that Banco de la Nacion Argentina, the government-owned commercial bank, and the Central Bank would refinance farmers' debts over four years with subsidised interest rates.</p>

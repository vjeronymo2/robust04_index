			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Forte closes deal on Italian joint venture Forte, the UK hotels group, has reached agreement with ENI, the Italian state owned energy and chemicals concern, on a joint venture to take management control of ENI's motorway hotels in Italy. No value has been placed on the deal, which involves 18 hotels and motels owned by ENI's Agip and Snam subsidiaries. All the hotels are located near motorways and main roads where Agip Petroli, ENI's petroleum distribution arm, has filling stations and service areas. Mr Gaetano Cecchetti, a director of ENI, said the deal would raise some L200bn for the group, which is under pressure from the government to privatise some of its activities and improve its financial performance. Mr Cecchetti gave no indication of how the figure was derived. However, he said the joint venture with Forte could also entail new hotel projects outside Italy.</p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STARS STOP SOCKERS IN OVERTIME  </P> <P> There are two constants when the Sockers meet the Tacoma Stars: The game will  be close, and it will be physical.  </P> <P> So it was Saturday night at the Tacoma Dome. The Stars won the Major Indoor  Soccer League game, 4-3, when Preki ripped in a 45-footer with his left foot at  3:00 of the second overtime before 8,868.  </P> <P> Godfrey Ingram got the assist with a perfect square pass from the right boards.  </P> <P> Thus Tacoma, with a penchant for losing the close ones, ended its streak of  one-goal losses at six against the last team it beat that way.  </P> <P> The Sockers fell to 13-12, failing for the third consecutive game to get Ron  Newman his 500th career coaching victory. Tacoma (12-14) is back in fifth place  and in the playoff hunt.  </P> <P> Tacoma had the best of the early part of the overtime, but a couple of saves by  Victor Nogueira of high drives by Preki and Ingram kept the Stars at bay.  </P> <P> From the beginning of this game, the battle lines were apparent: Branko Segota  versus the world.  </P> <P> Segota started exchanging words with Tacoma's Neil Megson early, then jawed at  the Stars' Gregg Blasingame and finally exchanged elbows with Tacoma's Bill  Crook early in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> A few minutes later, at 4:41, he tripped Blasingame to draw 2 minutes, and the  Stars scored the go-ahead goal on a power play at 5:26. Ingram nicely slid a  diagonal pass just in front of Nogueira, and Peter Ward flicked it in at the  far post.  </P> <P> The Sockers tied it at 3-3 at 11:42 when Cacho's drive hit the crossbar and the  rebound fell at the feet of Alan Willey, who finished it with a slide volley.  </P> <P> The Sockers' first lead was at 2-1, 43 seconds into the second half. Rookie  Paul Wright, on right wing on a two-on-one break, took Cacho's pass on the run.  Tacoma goalkeeper P.J. Johns came out, but Wright shot past him and inside the  far post for his first MISL goal.  </P> <P> Tacoma tied it 2-2 at 2:45 when Andy Schmetzer swiped an outlet pass from  Nogueira that was intended for Gus Mokalis. Schmetzer's low drive from right  wing was inside the far post.  </P> <P> In a 1-1 first half, Tacoma scored first at 1:08 of the second quarter on a bit  of magic created by Preki.  </P> <P> The Stars midfielder blew past Chris Chueden on right wing and squared a pass  to the feet of Schmetzer on the run. Schmetzer's low drive from 35 feet was  just inside the near post.  </P> <P> The Socks tied it at 9:45 on a power-play goal by Paul Dougherty after Tacoma  was whistled for its sixth foul.  </P> <P> Steve Zungul headed a ball through the box that Dougherty half-volleyed off the  far post and in.  </P> <P> The Sockers then thwarted a Stars power play after Sockers' sixth foul, though  a shot by Preki hit the post.  </P> <P> Though there was no score in the physical early going, both Johns and Nogueira  were called upon to make saves often in the first 10 minutes.  </P> <P> Johns choked off a one-on-one by Socker defender George Fernandez in the box  and stopped rockets by Ralf Wilhelms and Mokalis.  </P> <P> Nogueira saved shots by Preki and Star midfielder Nikki Ristic.  </P> <P> Sockers Notes  </P> <P> Socker Coach Ron Newman picked up a yellow card for dissent early in the  overtime. . . . The Sockers played without Brian Quinn and Zoran Karic, who  came down with a bruised right foot. Rookie Paul Wright played in place of  Karic up front. . . . Tacoma radio broadcaster Dick Calvert will originate a  veteran radio broadcast from the MISL All-Star game in Dallas, but XTRA (690  AM), the Sockers' outlet, has no plans to carry the game, according to Sockers  broadcaster Randy Hahn. . . . Steve Zungul received hoots and jeers for the  Tacoma crowd in his first game here since leaving the Stars after last season.  </P></p>

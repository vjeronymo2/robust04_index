This stand does not mean a  relinquishment of the objective of a just and comprehensive  peace in the region, for the Arabs are advocates of true peace  and their sincere efforts have not received the minimum level of  Israeli response. The suspension of talks will not harm the  peace talks, especially since only a few days are left before  the conclusion of these talks. Basically, Israel wanted these  talks to be futile. Moreover, for more than two years, these  talks have been confronted with Israeli intransigence and  flagrant evasions of the UN Security Council resolutions and  their requirements.    We say this because no sooner had the Arab delegations  announced the suspension of negotiations than the Tel Aviv  rulers began to shed crocodile tears over the peace process that  they themselves foiled. During the sixth round, the Syrian  delegation presented an objective and balanced working paper  that gained support from international circles. However, this  paper received no Israeli response because it calls for full  withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories in implementation  of the U.S. initiative -- the land-for-peace formula.    The Syrian and Lebanese tracks did not make the desired  progress, and the talks continued to revolve in a vicious  circle. Israel has succeeded in pulling the Palestinian side  out of the framework of the Washington talks and their tracks,  and dragged it to Oslo. Following this, it proclaimed to all  that peace has been achieved in the region, after which the  Palestinians, who were supposed to enjoy the fruits of this  alleged peace, woke up to see their houses and quarters  destroyed by tank missiles, to see that the number of victims of  Zionist terrorism has increased, and finally, to see the holy  Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the Israeli Army's serious  escalation of killings. This Army has closed the occupied  territories and subjugated them to military siege.    It is clear to the simplest observer that the peace process  has been obstructed throughout these two years, and we can see  no hope for the success of the peace process thanks to Israel's  rejection of the UN Security Council resolutions, which were  adopted as a basis for peace. These resolutions call for the  return of all occupied Arab territories, for protection of their  identity and history, and for a halt in the establishment of  settlements there.    Israel does not want to return the land. Neither does it  want to stop settlements. In fact, it plans to Judaize the land  and to devour it later. All this is taking place under the  pretext of security. The whole world has seen who is  threatening the security of whom. Palestinians were killed  while they were kneeling on the ground to worship God; Lebanese  citizens were killed while they were worshipping God at the  Sayyidat al-Najat Church. None of the Arabs has ever bombed a  synagogue, but the Israelis have never spared a mosque or a  church. They have committed all sins and perpetrated all  crimes. They have ripped open the abdomens of women and killed  infants in Dayr Yasin. Genocide has always been the crux of  their aggressive, expansionist policy.    The Tel Aviv rulers claim that they have taken strict  measures against some settlers whom they call extremists. These  measures, if they turn to be true, are confined to merely  preventing these settlers from leaving their settlements with  their arms. It is to be noted that such measures were taken in  the past and they were only aimed at deluding public opinion.  The Israeli rulers are the ones who allocated billions of  dollars to reinforce settlements in the occupied territories.  They have cheated the U.S Administration, and the U.S.  Administration itself admitted this, when they used hundreds of  millions of dollars of the loan guarantees they received, in  violation of their commitments, to expand settlements,  confiscate more Arab land, and expel more Arabs.    The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has proven that it is  impossible  to trust Israel's claims and agreements, and that removing and  dismantling the settlements and expelling the settlers has  become a basic condition for peace. Instead of shedding  crocodile tears over the future of peace in the region, Israel's  rulers should accept its requirements and abide by the  implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions. Peace  can be achieved tomorrow if Israel withdraws from the occupied  Arab territories. However, peace will not be achieved today, or  tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow if Israel continues its  course of occupation, settlement, procrastination, and  blackmail, and of rejecting a just and comprehensive peace in  the Middle East.    The UN Security Council, whose members are now discussing  the  massacre, will fail to perform its tasks and to assume its  responsibilities if it does not secure protection to the  Palestinian people and stress the need for a full and  comprehensive Israeli withdrawal. Denunciations and  condemnations are not sufficient to deter Israel and to prevent  it from perpetrating new massacres, which will inevitably lead  the region to explosion if the situation continues as it is.</p>

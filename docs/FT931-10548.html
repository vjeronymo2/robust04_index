			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Revenue accounts proposals attacked INLAND REVENUE proposals to require self-employed people to prepare their accounts for the tax year ending in April would place 'impossible pressures' on accountants, the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants warned today, Andrew Jack writes. At the moment a range of deadlines is available for the self-employed. In response to the Revenue's consultative document on restructuring the tax system issued late last year, the association argues against the case for 'fiscal accounting'. It says accounts preparation for the self-employed would be compressed into a six-month period that is already taken up with pay-as-you-earn tax work. That would force businesses to recruit temporary staff, and threaten to jeopardise the quality of tax preparation work carried out. The association also says that the proposals shift the administrative burden on to the taxpayer, and could lead to the creation of a more adversarial system.</p>

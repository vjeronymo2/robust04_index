Sung, and Michael Smith] </F>   [Text] China's intention to summon a civil servant to  Beijing to explain the airport management plan to the  Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) signals the start of a fight  for control of the bureaucracy ahead of 1997.    Beijing sent a written invitation to Chief Secretary Anson  Chan, asking Hong Kong officials to visit Beijing. The letter,  dated yesterday and printed in Chinese, said the invitation was  at the request of the Chinese government. "The PWC's Economic  Group sincerely invites government officials to attend the group  meeting ... to explain some points contained in the Airport  Corporation Bill so as to avoid misunderstandings," the letter  said. It was signed by PWC leaders Nellie Fong and Gao  Shangquan.    Describing the letter as "only a beginning", pro-China  sources said: "From now on, the battleground between China and  Britain will be the civil service."    It is understood China has a list of subjects on which it  wants input from top-ranking local administrators--ranging from  changes to laws to fit in with the post-1997 situation to  infrastructural projects such as the new airport and Container  Terminal 9. Such input is intended to help the PWC formulate  policies for after 1997.    The pro-China sources also told The Standard that this  tussle  was signalled last month when some PWC members, notably Vincent  Lo, head of the Business and Professionals Federation, suggested  civil servants should be nominated to the committee. The  suggestion met strong opposition from the government and  legislators.    Beijing decided then that it could expect no cooperation  from  the administration and became even more determined to take  control of the top rungs of the civil service to undermine  Governor Chris Patten. Beijing is understood to have prepared  for this fight.    In anticipation of the failure in the Sino-British talks,  one  of the first tasks assigned to the PWC was to seek talent and  recommend local civil servants for all key positions. PWC  member and former Executive and Legislative Councillor Rita Fan  and others met more than a dozen top civil servants within days  of the first PWC plenary session in July last year. It is  understood that since then China has worked out who it does not  want and who will hold key positions.    Among those it does not want are Chief Secretary Anson Chan,  Secretary for Constitutional Affairs Michael Sze, and Director  of Broadcasting Cheung Man-yi. It is also understood that China  might like to see some former top-rank civil servants who  resigned recently return to the service.    Chan is standing firm on her refusal of China's invitation.  "I think I have already said we have well established channels  of communication," she said yesterday.    Finance Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod said: "If these people  have questions of clarifications on the bill, they are welcome  to put them and we will answer them. But there is no question  of us sending people to Beijing to appear before the PWC."    In Beijing, the State Council's Hong kong and Macao Affairs  Office director, Lu Ping, said he regretted the government's  decision.</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Letter: WHO studying natural drugs Sir, Marjorie Shaffer's article about the pharmaceutical industry turning to nature as a source of new drugs (Technology, September 29) made no mention of the World Health Organisation also running a project on the study of non-western healing methods - a study inspired by the third world itself. Last year on vacation in Bhutan I visited a hospital co-sponsored by the WHO and by an Italian charitable organisation - a small international research team headed by an Italian doctor. It certainly is not amazing that this country was selected for such a scheme. Bhutan used to be called 'the country of the medicinal herbs'. A native pharmaceutical chemist told us that there were over 100 Bhutanese herbs to be studied. In this small country three traditional Asiatic healing methods are further practised: Chinese, Indian and Tibetan medicine. Who will be the first to imitate Lisa Conte's Californian example and try to commercialise the Bhutanese findings? Clara C Meijers, Italielaan 36/16, 1050 Brussels, Belgium</p>

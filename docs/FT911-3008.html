			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (11): A debt may well be good for us - Paying off the mortgage / Basic-rate taxpayers should look before they leap OUR PARENTS probably told us to stay out of debt if we possibly could. Good advice, in the main. However, one kind of debt may be worth clinging to - the mortgage. Many people realise this, as is shown by a survey conducted by Mori for Scottish Amicable, the life insurance group. Asked how they would use a Pounds 30,000 windfall, 42 per cent of respondents said none of it would go towards repaying their mortgage. Only 13 per cent said all of it would. The proportion who would repay rose with the size of the mortgage. Only 31 per cent of those with a Pounds 40,000 mortgage said they would not break into their windfall to repay any of the loan, while 28 per cent said it would all be used to reduce the debt. This suggests that people are well informed about mortgages. On loans up to Pounds 30,000, tax relief on the interest makes them very cheap debts - despite the Budget - but the net interest rates paid on larger loans are worth avoiding. This is shown by comparing the real rate of interest paid on a home loan, after mortgage interest tax relief, with the rates of interest available elsewhere. On the first Pounds 30,000 of a mortgage, the net interest rate after mortgage-interest tax relief, is currently 10.31 per cent, according to the Building Societies Association. This will become better value if interest rates continue to fall. If any kind of debt makes you lie awake at night, then it is probably best to pay off the mortgage as soon as you have the cash to do so. However, some people, including mortgage-lenders themselves, argue that this approach is unnecessarily prudent, because you should be able to find a safe alternative investment that offers a higher rate of interest than you pay on your mortgage - for example, tax-exempt special saver accounts (Tessas), index-linked gilts or national saving certificates. Steven Berry, of Hill Martin, points out that the new regime of independent taxation and the abolition of composite rate tax on building-society accounts for non-taxpayers, have made this easier - a non-tax-paying spouse can receive some interest gross, while paying off debt net of tax. By investing in this way a sum that might otherwise be used to reduce a mortgage, you still have the cash in hand. For as long as you have a mortgage, your building society is available to help with loans for home-improvements or repairs. John Bridel, adviser with Towry Law, adds: 'Very often one should keep the funding vehicle going, anyway.' He points out that you should not necessarily repay endowment-linked mortgages in full, as you will lose the terminal bonus of the life insurance policy linked to the mortgage. The money put towards the life policy makes up a relatively small percentage of the total monthly payments, points out Mr Bridel; but the balance of the final maturity value, after you have paid off the loan, could be very useful  -for instance, to invest for retirement income. The terminal bonus, which could be lost, makes up much of the return from with-profits policies. Sometimes, too, one is required to pay an exit-fee when clearing a mortgage. If you decide to pay off without notice, some lenders may charge a maximum of an extra three months' interest on redemption. The Building Societies Association says this would almost certainly be waived in most cases, and the big societies do not make the charge, but it is as well to check the small print in your contract. Check, too, on fixed-interest mortgages. The special arrangements that the lender has made in order to offer a fixed rate will be thrown awry by early repayment; and a justifiable fee of around Pounds 100 will normally be payable. You pay the full gross rate on all of the mortgage that is outstanding above the Pounds 30,000 limit for mortgage tax relief. Last year, gross mortgage rates managed to exceed 15 per cent. You are unlikely to find another investment that can guarantee to match this return - though Tessa rates appear to be remainining high while mortgage rates come down - so the best bet is to use any lump sum to pay off any of your mortgage in excess of Pounds 30,000. The abolition of top-rate mortgage tax relief has made mortgages significantly less good value for the very well off, and tax relief must be subject to continued political risk. Successive governments have allowed the threshold of Pounds 30,000 to be eaten away by inflation - if it had been indexed from its rate in 1974, the threshold would now be almost Pounds 120,000, according to Hill Martin - and it might be cut completely by a Labour government. The Conservatives intend to cut basic-tax rates, which would reduce the amount of relief. All such changes shift the logic in favour of repaying more of the mortgage. But it is worth timing the move carefully if you have a building-society repayment mortgage, because the societies charge interest on the capital outstanding at the beginning of their year, and then collect it over the 12 months. On this basis, you should make your repayment towards the end of the building society year - most societies have a December 31 year-end. If you are repaying a part of the loan on which you are receiving tax relief, you should let your tax inspector know as soon as possible, says Mr Bridel. Otherwise you could find yourself with a big tax bill at the end of the year.</p>

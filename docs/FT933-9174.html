			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Management: Selectors' choice - Andrew Baxter explains how JCB reorganised 300 employees into separate product divisions There is an office wall at JC Bamford Excavators' headquarters at Rocester in Staffordshire which three of the company's senior executives are unlikely to forget. At the turn of the year the wall held the names of some 300 JCB employees whose individual strengths and weaknesses were discussed, analysed - and occasionally tussled over - by Henry Shirman, Mike Butler and John Appleby. The process was a vital prelude to the reorganisation into separate product businesses (and profit centres) of the main divisions of the UK's largest construction equipment company. Appointed to the top posts in the new businesses by chief executive Martin Coyne, who conceived the new organisation with chairman Sir Anthony Bamford, the three had the unenviable task of sitting down together to select their teams. 'We tried very hard to be fair,' says Shirman, formerly director of manufacturing and product engineering who is now managing director of the new backhoe loader division. (Butler, formerly managing director of JCB Sales, is running the new loadall division, while Appleby has moved from purchasing director to running the new wheeled loader division.) Everybody was assessed on eight different characteristics and, if the three could not agree, they would turn to Coyne or personnel director Alan Fernyhough for help. For Sir Anthony, the process has been a revealing one. When making a reorganisation such as this, he says: 'You can't rely too heavily on past assessments of people, because these tend to err on the side of being nice. In a crisis when you are laying people off, you look at the assessments and everyone is bloody marvellous.' In contrast, the much more rigorous 'names-on-the-wall' process has brought into focus the team players and those who were coasting. Inevitably, some faces did not fit, although less than 10 people had to go. But valuable insights into the remainder were gained, enabling the three new divisional leaders to 'take a chance' on some people by increasing their responsibilities. JCB has had a decentralised structure before. In 1984 it broke up a previously unitary organisation into product divisions, but four years later went back to the original structure for its main Rocester-based products, which helped to tighten management of product design and development. The smaller divisions such as JCB Landpower for agricultural products were kept separate. The new approach, introduced in April, creates divisions which will have exclusive responsibility for the future of the main product lines - everything from design and product development to marketing. Basic manufacturing such as welding will still be done centrally, but the new divisions will each be responsible for painting and final assembly. Shirman retains a central research responsibility for the group, because of the dominance of backhoe loaders in the sales mix. 'With hindsight,' says Sir Anthony, 'what we didn't do in the mid-1980s was to split the products up enough as businesses. We did not make them into proper profit centres.' The aim is to create multi-disciplinary teams which will sit together and concentrate solely on one product line. The hope is that by identifying more closely with a particular product employees at all levels will understand the need for increased profitability and be encouraged to participate in achieving it. JCB is betting that, as it grows bigger, this approach makes better sense than having one product engineering and manufacturing department serving a combined marketing and sales division. With marketing - a crucial skill in the construction equipment industry - now under the control of the new profit centres, the three divisions' only internal 'customer' is a new sales and service division. But there are obvious risks in the new structure. Probably the biggest danger from decentralisation, Sir Anthony accepts, is the dissipation of the company's considerable purchasing power for parts and components. To retain this, one of the three divisions will act as 'lead buyer' for a particular component, such as engines, and negotiate on behalf of all three. But if it makes commercial sense for one of the divisions to source components separately, it will do so. Other concerns include how to avoid duplicating contacts with dealers, who sell the entire JCB range, and thus provide the essential link with end-users and market trends. But the benefits of the new organisation are already coming through. 'We can move faster. The incentive to look at new ideas is much greater,' says Butler. Appleby, who has one of the toughest tasks at JCB reviving the 'poor relation' wheeled-loader range, says there were initial question marks about whether the new structure could make a difference. 'But we now have much more of a team spirit. The one thing in my team's life is wheeled loaders.' Already the new approach has led to an improvement in quality and spurred suggestions from the team about modifications. The handling of warranties has also been changed. The new sales and service division charges out warranty costs directly to the new divisions, giving them an incentive to fix a problem quickly and ensure that it does not happen again. Some grey areas such as training remain, but Sir Anthony believes the new approach will bring a marked improvement in profitability by next year. And that is important for JCB, even if, as a family-owned company, it does not have a share price to worry about. What it does show is that a company widely admired as a rare success story in post-war British engineering is true to its motto - jamais content.</p>

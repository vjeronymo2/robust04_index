			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 6 (XINHUA) -- The mainland will  properly handle the boat tragedy that claimed the lives of 24  Taiwanese tourists and eight mainlanders, said a senior official  from the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits  (ARATS).    In a telephone conversation this afternoon with Chiao  Jen-ho,  vice-chairman and secretary general of the Taiwan-based Straits  Exchange Foundation (SEF), Tang Shubei, vice-president of ARATS,  said that leaders of the Chinese central government and other  departments concerned attached serious importance to the  accident.    He said Zhejiang Province had made emergency efforts to  locate and recover the remains of the dead. The local  authorities had also given a lot of help to the relatives of the  victims who went to Zhejiang to settle the matter.    The 32 victims died on March 31 when the tourist boat they  boarded burst into flames on Qiandao Lake in East China's  Zhejiang Province.    Tang said that he understood SEF's expectations.    He said that ARATS had done everything it could to keep in  touch with SEF.    He told Chiao that Beijing had dispatched a team of  specialists to the accident site to conduct an investigation.    Tang said that such a tragedy was the last thing the two  sides want to see, adding that there are more than one million  Taiwan compatriots visiting the mainland every year. It was a  rare accident, he said.    Chiao conveyed to Tang the concerns and opinions of the  Taiwan public. Tang said he will forward the information to  relevant departments.</p>

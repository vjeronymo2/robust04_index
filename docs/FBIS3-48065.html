			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] BANGKOK, Jan 22 (AFP) -- Two Burmese dissident  groups disagreed Saturday on whether 12 student leaders had been  detained by the Karen National Union (KNU) in the ethnic group's  border headquarters at Manerplaw.    A member of the All Burma Students Democratic Front (ABSDF)  told AFP by telephone that the group's leader, Moe Thee Zun, and  11 others had been held briefly by the KNU last week and freed  unharmed. But a Bangkok spokesman for the National Council for  the Union of Burma (NCUB), the umbrella organization of the  dissident groups, said the Karens had not held the students and  a NCUB statement denying reports of the detention was accurate.    The statement said the students were holding talks with the  Karens to "prevent...any misunderstanding...in connection with  the KNU's decision to hold talks individually with the SLORC  [State Law and Order Restoraion Council]. There is no serious  problem between the KNU and the Student Army or any other ally."    The Karen National Union and the student's group are  apparently at odds over the Karens' decision to seek separate  peace talks with the State Law and Order Restoration Council  (SLORC), as the Rangoon junta is called. The students want to  maintain a united front, but other opposition groups have backed  the Karens, the oldest and most powerful opposition group.  [passage omitted]</p>

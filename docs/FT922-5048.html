			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Routes to being considered for an honour THE WHITEHALL MACHINE:  technically anybody can make a recommendation, but most come through the Civil Service grapevine. Each principal department has a subcommittee that sifts names and forwards them to a central honours pool run by the Cabinet Office. Names are then passed to 10 Downing Street and eventually to Buckingham Palace. THE QUEEN: has her own list for the Order of Merit and for some orders of chivalry. POLITICAL PARTIES: the principal route is through the whips' offices. Conservative Central Office feeds candidates to the chief whip - one of whose titles is patronage secretary - and after sifting they go to the Cabinet Office and on to 10 Downing Street. Nominations from opposition parties go the same way. THE PRIME MINISTER: can add or subtract from the lists the Civil Service supplies, and it is at that stage that glamour names, such as pop and sports stars, are added.</p>

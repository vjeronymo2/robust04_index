			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: The planet's biggest party - The shapes and sizes crammed into the Athletes' Village YESTERDAY I went for a stroll through the Olympic Village. It is jammed with human beings from five continents and 172 countries. As the number of Olympic events and participating nations grows, so does the variety of human shapes, sizes, colours and physical abilities. The 11,000 athletes gathered here probably form the largest and most differentiated collection of genetic types assembled in any one place in human history. I ambled past beefy Samoans, mustachioed Turks, lithe Indonesians, wild Mongolians, coal-black Sudanese and cool blond Finns. There was even a Liverpudlian or two. If my powers of identification seem miraculous, the explanation is easy: all athletes in the Village wear plastic identity cards around their necks. What the cards do not indicate, though, is the sport each athlete practises. I began to play my own Olympic game, guessing from body type the sport that each passer-by played. Some were easy. Sky-scraping black Americans such as David Robinson can only be basketball players. The Australian swimmer I saw could be identified by her broad shoulders, good tan and hair turned a greeny-blond by chlorinated pools. Marathon runners like Rosa Mota seem to have a thin, haggard look even before they run. High jumpers are the general shape of string beans. Weightlifters such as Turkey's Naim Suleymanoglu have thighs like hams. Other guesses were more difficult. Really practised sports-spotters, I am told, can even pick out archers. Britain's Steve Hallard, for example, has slightly lop-sided shoulders, thickened fingers and a calloused chin from a lifetime of hefting bows and drawing bowstrings. Although the Russians once spent much time and effort with a scientifically-designed computer programme to discover the 'ideal' athletic type - and came up with 6ft, 14 1/2 -stone Olympic sprinter Valeri Borzov - there is not an individual in the world with a morphology that answers perfectly to the countless different physical demands of all sports. None the less, in a world filled with unending human variation there are individuals whose exceptional body make-up allows them to excel as sportsmen and women in one field or another. What makes a top class athlete? The first answer must be genetics. We are either born with superlative athletic ability or we are not. We can improve our bodies to some extent, but not beyond their genetic limitations. Most of us could train until we dropped and still follow only very distantly in the footsteps of British sprinter Linford Christie, who has hopes of a medal. But simple muscle power is not enough. We all have 'slow-twitch' and 'fast-twitch' muscles, in about equal proportions. High-performance athletes are different. Sprinters have a very high proportion of fast-twitch muscle for explosive bursts of energy. Marathoners, on the other hand, are all slow twitch for endurance. Christie could never be a good marathon runner, nor could Kenya's hope for marathon gold, Ibrahim Hussein, be a sprinter. Nor does Christie necessarily have the oxygen uptake capacity that all endurance athletes require. Genetics determine our blood's ability to absorb oxygen and carry it to the muscles. Sprinters or weightlifters do not need high aerobic capacity - they work with oxygen already in their systems - but distance runners, rowers, cross-country skiers and cyclists do. Physical flexibility is another critical variable. So is hand-eye co-ordination. If there are individuals whose specific physical make-up allows them to excel in certain sports, are there groups of people sharing common genetic characteristics that similarly excel? More precisely, are there certain races that have natural sporting advantages? In a perfect, just and racially unbiased world, the question would be logical and innocent enough. In the world as it actually exists, it is a question fraught with 1,000 hazards. Walking around the Olympic Village, one cannot but be struck by the physical appearance of black athletes. To the eye they are bigger, stronger and more muscled than most other athletes. In certain sporting events they dominate. In the 100 metres final at the 1991 Tokyo world championships, six men clocked under 10 seconds. All eight runners in the final were black. East Africans today are leaders in distance running. Blacks are conspicuously absent, on the other hand, in some sports  -a black American has yet to win an international swimming event, for example. I have talked to sports physiologists (they prefer not to be named) who assure me that blacks - African Americans, Afro-Caribbeans and Africans - are indeed better physically endowed than other races. Many things about them, they say, are different: their bone structure, their body-limb ratios, the length and mass of their musculation, their body fat content, their bio-chemistry. The fact is, however, that no research on sports performance by racial category has been conducted since Hitler's attempts to prove Aryan racial superiority. Other considerations aside, such studies are politically unacceptable; no research body in the world would receive funding for such studies. On the other hand, there is much evidence to suggest that superlative sports performance by blacks is sociologically determined. Kenyan distance runners may excel because they spent childhoods running to school at high altitudes. For many US and British blacks, sport has been a ticket out of the ghetto. A winner is accepted into society whatever his colour. There is also a bandwagon effect in sport. If an American black won a gold medal for swimming, every black kid on the block in Harlem would start looking at swimming pools in a different way, if he had access to one. But certain sports bring more money and prestige than others. American male volleyball and swimming teams at the Olympics are white-dominated. If they produced as much financial reward and respect among the black American community as basketball, the US volleyball and swimming teams might have as many black stars as US basketball's Dream Team. Above and beyond sociology, there are two considerations that make a nonsense of racial superiority in sport. The first is that athletes of any colour are not representative of broad racial characteristics. They are 1-in-1m genetic exceptions whose make-up bears no relation to any means or averages. They stand outside racial considerations. The second is not physiological, but mental. In high-level competition there is little difference between the muscle power, oxygen up-take or co-ordination of individuals. At this standard of competition, what very often makes the difference between a winner and a loser is mental attitude: a ferocious will to win and the ability to perform under pressure. This, and not an athlete's origins, is what makes Olympic competition the exciting spectacle and massive gamble that it is.</p>

			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / People: EEF decides on Mackenzie The Engineering Employers Federation has appointed Graham Mackenzie director-general, finally drawing a line under the uncertainty prompted by the surprise departure of former dg Neil Johnson and the possible merger with the Confederation of British Industry. Mackenzie, who was president of the EEF for two years to April, has been acting director-general since January. The new appointment takes effect from July 1. Johnson left the EEF at the end of November, a few weeks after Mackenzie had quit as chief executive of UES Holdings, the Rotherham-based steel and forgings group. Since then, Mackenzie has been increasingly active at the EEF. The organisation has known since February that it would need to appoint a new director-general, once it became clear that a plan to merge its central functions with the CBI had collapsed. A more limited partnership based on a joint programme of alliance with the CBI's National Manufacturing Council will also not take place, although the EEF and CBI will continue to co-operate. Mackenzie, 50, lacks some of Johnson's affability but is an effective and articulate communicator, and is keen to maintain and develop the EEF's profile. Before joining UES in 1990, he worked for the TI Group from 1967 to 1989, joining as a graduate trainee and rising to become a main board director. Between 1981 and 1983, he was seconded by TI to the government's Central Policy Review Staff.</p>

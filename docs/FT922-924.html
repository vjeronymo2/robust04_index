			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / International Company News: Reselections at seven top French state jobs THE CHAIRMEN of seven French state-owned companies were yesterday re-appointed for fresh three-year terms by the cabinet, which also confirmed the change of leadership at Bull, the loss-making computer maker. This concludes the first stage of a review of the top jobs in France's powerful public sector. The second round, a dozen jobs covering banking, insurance, public transport and energy supply, is due to be settled at next Wednesday's cabinet meeting. Yesterday's reappointments include Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, the controversial chairman of the bank Credit Lyonnais. He has been criticised for expanding too fast and making too many risky loans, but has the support of Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister. The remaining six are the chairmen of Air France; Pechiney, the aluminium and packaging group; Elf Aquitaine in oil; the Thomson electronics group; Banque Hervet; and Anvar, the applied research agency. Mr Beregovoy has said he wants to make as few changes as possible in the 45 public sector jobs up for review this year. But he is expected next week to ask for chairmen of Banque Nationale de Paris, the largest government-owned bank; Electricite de France, the power utility; and Aerospatiale, the aircraft maker, to step down because they reach the statutory retirement age of 65 next year. Other jobs expected to come up for review next week include the chairmanships of the three state-owned insurance companies, Union des Assurances de Paris, Groupe GAN and Assurances Generales de France. One or two insurers could see changes as a side-effect of the retirement of Mr Rene Thomas, chairman of BNP. Snecma, the aircraft engine maker, could see a change because its current chairman, Mr Louis Gallois, is a candidate to replace Mr Henri Martre at Aerospatiale.</p>

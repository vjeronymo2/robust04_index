			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> BOZ FACES COMEBACK FROM SHOULDER INJURY  </P> <P> Brian Bosworth's heart is still into football, but he has nine months to prove  to himself and the Seattle Seahawks that he still has the body to continue  playing.  </P> <P> The Boz' agent, Gary Wichard, said his client faces a difficult rehabilitation  of his ailing right shoulder, where injuries have put his three-year career in  question.  </P> <P> "I'm not a betting guy, but I would bet on him coming back," Wichard said. "If  it's up to Brian Bosworth, he will work hard and be ready."  </P> <P> Whether Bosworth can come back, and for how long, is uncertain.  </P> <P> Bosworth damaged the joint in his right shoulder trying to make an arm tackle  of Phoenix Cardinals fullback Ron Wolfley in the second game of the season.  Though surgery wasn't required, Bosworth never played again. In 1988, he  underwent arthroscopic surgery to remove a loose piece of cartilage that was  floating in his left shoulder.  </P> <P> "Brian has two shoulder joints, and there are two deteriorated joints," Wichard  said. "This year's problem is similar to the one last year except there isn't  any cartilage floating in the joint that make it lock up. He just needs to  rehab it like he did the left one."  </P></p>

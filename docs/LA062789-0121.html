			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. OFFICIALS REMINDED OF PROMISE  </P> <P> Elected officials often make a promise, form a committee or pass a resolution,  figuring that will take the steam out of public pressure on an issue. But they  are learning not to do that with Orange County Congregation-Community  Organizations, a group of members of 15 churches. The parishioners have banded  together in a grass-roots effort to cope with Orange County's growing drug  problem and, as part of the process, to make local government try harder to  cope with drugs.  </P> <P> Last April, congregations from churches and synagogues in Anaheim and Santa Ana  were given what sounded to them like commitments by the Santa Ana and Anaheim  city councils to launch a coordinated effort to help eradicate drugs. Both  councils then passed resolutions declaring that a drug epidemic exists in the  community. The County Board of Supervisors also adopted the drug resolution  proposed by the church group.  </P> <P> A week ago Monday, several hundred parishioners followed up on their initial  effort by asking Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter what action the city had taken since  making its anti-drug commitment in April. Some complained that there was still  no action taken against drug dealers in their neighborhoods.  </P> <P> The mayor acknowledged that there had been little activity since last April and  said that he planned to meet with the police chief and city attorney. Hunter  also pledged a clampdown on drug dealers operating out of businesses or homes  and said he would report back in two weeks on what progress he was making in  seeking stepped up enforcement and more money for anti-drug operations.  </P> <P> We suspect that the church group will keep the pressure on the councils and  will return in the not-too-distant future to ask for yet another accounting. At  that session, the parishioners will no doubt be less inclined to accept pledges  and promises as substitutes for real progress.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> JAPAN CABINET BAN ON STOCKS URGED  </P> <P> Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita today proposed banning stock trading  by Cabinet members and requiring regular disclosure of their assets during  their tenure, government spokesmen said.  </P> <P> Takeshita submitted the proposals to a private group of advisers and also  suggested ministers keep their shares in a blind trust. At present, ministers  are allowed to deal in stocks, and must disclose their assets only once at the  time of appointment.  </P> <P> The proposals come as the Takeshita government is embroiled in an insider  trading scandal involving pre-listed shares in a subsidiary of Recruit Co. More  than a dozen politicians and businessmen have been arrested on bribery charges  in the case.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH-SPEED TRAIN FROM O.C. TO VEGAS  </P> <P> According to recent news articles, plans are in progress to build a privately  funded super-train between Las Vegas and Anaheim.  </P> <P> It appears that the major reason for this $5-billion expenditure is to more  easily transport California dollars to Nevada.  </P> <P> Why not use this money to build a casino complex of our own here in California  and keep all those gambling dollars at home? Think of the revenue available for  the government from such an operation!  </P> <P> We already have poker and the state lottery, so why not go all the way? We  could probably outdo Atlantic City, Reno and Las Vegas.  </P> <P> A super-train sounds nice, but if it's such a good investment, how come the  proponents are already talking about a subsidy?  </P> <P> Apparently they not only want to transport California dollars to Nevada, they  want the taxpayers to help pay for it!  </P> <P> AUDIE ASHCRAFT  </P> <P> Cypress  </P></p>

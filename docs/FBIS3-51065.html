			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, 10 Jan (PL) -- The Cuban revolution has  issued an appeal to its most important social base, the workers,  urging them to assume a leading role in the epic struggle being  waged by the country, and to launch an overall offensive given  the crisis that currently prevails in the nation.    An editorial published today by the weekly TRABAJADORES  insists Cuba mainly needs that workers everywhere to discuss in  depth issues dealing with the financial reorganization, among  other vital issues, given the difficult situation that currently  prevails.    "It is time for all of us to realize the specific political  and educational responsibility that corresponds to the labor  movement within the struggle for survival and afterwards, when  we fully enter a different world in many ways," it states.    The article gives continuity to other reflections included  in  the newspaper concerning the role that must be played by workers  in the island's economic reorganization process, given the  worsening of the U.S. blockade and the loss of its main trade  partners in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.    It urges workers to analyze ways to counter the excess of  circulating money and solve the budget deficit; decide whether  or not unproductive enterprises should be subsidized; decide if  it would be appropriate to implement a tax on salaries -- among  other current topics of interest for all the Cuban people.    The publication says: Acquainting himself with the mentality  of a society owner will enable each worker to implement the  principle of "I am the revolution."    It adds: Nothing can be so demoralizing as laziness,  indolence, negligence, careless work, lack of control on costs  and expenses, the brazen squandering of resources, and the  defeatism which imbues the atmosphere in certain work centers.    Assuming its role as official paper of the Central  Organization of Cuban Trade Unions, the weekly strives to  prepare approximately 3 million workers for imminent changes in  the country's economic and financial system and, in fact,  propose possible solutions from their work posts.    What actions can we carry out to encourage discipline and  work morale? How can we produce more, or better, with less  costs? Where can we reduce personnel? What policy should we  follow with excess personnel? What can we do to reduce or  eliminate subsidies? These are some of the issues on which it  urges workers to meditate.</p>

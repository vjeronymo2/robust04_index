			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Valyantsin Zhdanko: "Vyachaslaw Kebich Warns: </F> `If the Presidential Campaign Is a Bust,' Belarus Will Most  Likely Not Join Ruble Zone]    [Text] One of the main arguments and trump cards of the  prime minister in the presidential campaign is the  Russian-Belarusian agreement on joining the common ruble zone.  However, hope for an immediate provision of Belarusian citizens  with tricolored Russian banknotes did not come true. This  hampers Mr. Kebich's campaign to a great extent.    Relations with Russia and the forthcoming monetary union are  the main topics at meetings of the prime minister and his  electorate. They were also much discussed at Mr. Kebich's  meeting with professors of institutes of higher education in  Minsk, which was held at the Belarusian State University on 12  May. The present stage of the implementation of the  above-mentioned agreement was assessed by the prime minister in  the following way:    "Nine articles out of 12 are already in force. The most  essential article of this agreement concerns the lifting of  custom duties, quotas, and tariffs. Practically, it means that  prices for imported Russian goods will be lowered by about 25-30  percent. Consequently, this leads to a decrease in production  costs and to a possibility of falling retail prices. However,  it is undesirable to decrease retail prices today. Why?  Because even at current prices, a great flood of goods  (especially foodstuffs) outside of Belarus exists. Therefore,  our task is, while preserving the same retail prices, to  increase wages. This is a more proper way, and we will follow  it."    "With regard to other articles of the agreement, I should  say  that we need to bring some legislative acts in line with  legislative acts of the Russian Federation. However, I will  tell you honestly: During our talks with the Russian leadership,  one could sense an underlying sentiment: `We will wait and see  who will become your president...' The document signed by Oleg  Soskovets, Russia's first deputy prime minister, specifies the  term. Nine articles come in force before 31 July. Note that  this term was chosen not accidentally... Let us say  straightforwardly: If the presidential elections are a bust,  this may prevent the union from being formed."    In general, during the meeting, Mr. Kebich frequently  accentuated the delicacy of relations with our eastern neighbor  and their tendency to fluctuations due to seemingly  insignificant factors:    "There was a mention of our victory over Moscow regiments  near Orsha in 1514, and Russia cut off its gas supplies. This  was not accidental. We still owe debts to Russia for gas -- but  gas supplies continue... There was a mention of Belarusian  claims to Bransk and Smolensk Oblasts, for Vilnius region -- and  we received the next warning: `We will halt gas supplies if you  do not start paying.' Politics know no trifles. One has to be  very careful about politics and assess the situation very  accurately."    Understandably, Mr. Kebich himself has never made any such  statements on the victory near Orsha or some territorial claims.  Apparently, he had in mind statements and actions by the  Belarusian Popular Front...    The prime minister firmly cut himself off from the radical  ideas of both the "right" and the "left." He promised  stability, consequence, and continual progress after his victory  in the elections.</p>

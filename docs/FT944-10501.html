			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Better than good works Sir, James Morgan got it all wrong in his article about presidents and cardinals ('All the president's cardinals', November 5). It was precisely Martin Luther who emphasised the importance of belief, not works. He had observed how 'good works' were done by many people just to earn themselves a little throne in heaven, not in order to help others, and he detested the then fashion to pay others to do the 'good' works for you in order to achieve that aim. All that really mattered was believing in Christ's word - all the rest would follow. To start from the wrong historical premises would make one have grave doubts about the conclusions in the article . . .

			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NORTHRIDGE COMEBACK FALLS SHORT AS CS LONG BEACH PREVAILS, 88-73  </P> <P> After yet another loss, Cal State Northridge cannot be blamed for looking for  moral victories. In its 88-73 loss to Cal State Long Beach on Wednesday night,  it found a silver lining.  </P> <P> CSUN (1-6) not only held a team under 90 points for the first time all season,  it put together the best second-half comeback of its season.  </P> <P> Unlike the surges against Montana and Montana State -- where CSUN cut the  deficit from 28 points to within 14, but no closer -- the Matadors pulled  within three before the host 49ers pulled away for their second win against  four losses.  </P> <P> The 13-4 spurt started with a layup by freshman Andre Chevalier, pulled into  high gear when Chevalier set up Keith Gibbs for a reverse dunk, maintained  momentum with consecutive baskets by Shelton Boykin, continued with a steal and  10-foot bank shot by David Swanson and ended when Gibbs nailed a three-point  basket off a steal by Chevalier.  </P> <P> Suddenly, Long Beach Coach Seth Greenberg was throwing his suit coat into the  bleachers and chewing his players up one side and down the other.  </P> <P> Unfortunately for Northridge fans, the tirade had the desired effect. The 49ers  scored seven points in a row and outscored CSUN, 21-4, in a seven-minute span  that ended with the Matadors trailing, 76-57.  </P> <P> "We allowed some penetration which was the big thing we told 'em not to  permit," CSUN Coach Pete Cassidy said. "Lucious Harris is awful good at that  and they are so physical, they have amazing size and quickness. We also had a  touch of panic there with the press and that shouldn't have happened."  </P> <P> Harris, a former Cleveland High star, scored two of his game-high 25 points and  handed out three of his five assists immediately after the Matadors closed the  gap.  </P> <P> "We came out slow and they jumped out on us," Harris said. "I was scared. We  had to get back out there and work."  </P> <P> Although the rally earned CSUN a measure of respect, Gibbs is weary of the  Matadors' inability to maintain it.  </P> <P> "It makes me more frustrated to have a streak like that and not be able to hold  onto it," he said. "That streak showed us we can play, but we have to do that  the whole game."  </P> <P> Chevalier, whose defense helped key the streak, earned the praise of his former  Cleveland High Coach Bobby Braswell, now a 49ers assistant coach.  </P> <P> "It is good to see him -- I can say it now -- play that well," Braswell said.  "He played great defense, he put some pressure on some people. He always had  the biggest heart. He has no fear, he took charges from some 6-8 and 6-9 guys  and he's only 5-8, you know."  </P> <P> The 6-8 and 6-9 guys caused problems nonetheless. Frankie Edwards scored 15  points and Bryon Russell had 14.  </P> <P> CSUN, which has pressed all season, abandoned the press because of the 49ers  quickness, but Long Beach used it after made baskets and forced seven  first-half turnovers with it.  </P> <P> Northridge also was whistled for four traveling violations and an out-of-bounds  violation.  </P></p>

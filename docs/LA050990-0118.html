			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUNSET LEAGUE SOFTBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MIYAHARA'S RETURN HELPS MARINA BEAT FOUNTAIN VALLEY, 1-0  </P> <P> Janet Miyahara, a junior right-hander coming off a two-week layoff with a  sprained left ankle, pitched a two-hitter Tuesday as the Marina High School  softball team defeated Fountain Valley, 1-0.  </P> <P> Miyahara (13-1), who transferred from Fountain Valley after her sophomore year,  gave Marina (23-5, 8-1) sole possession of first place in the Sunset League.  </P> <P> Rae Rice (15-2) took the loss for Fountain Valley (19-6, 7-2), the defending  league co-champions with Marina.  </P> <P> "(Miyahara's) changeup was her best pitch," Marina Coach Susie Calderon said.  "She can throw it for strikes and has incredible motion. She mixed her pitches  well. I didn't know how strong she'd be because she pushes off her bad ankle."  </P> <P> Miyahara struck out three and walked one for the Vikings. She kept Fountain  Valley's batters hitting ground balls most of the game.  </P> <P> Marina scored the winning run in the second inning.  </P> <P> Miyahara singled to center and Becky Toler reached first on a sacrifice and a  fielder's choice. Miyahara was tagged out at the plate on Annie Presutti's  single to center field, but Toler reached third on Danelle Lovetro's throw.  </P> <P> Julie Luft's one-out grounder to second was momentarily bobbled by Traci Werts,  leaving only the play at first and Toler scored.  </P> <P> Fountain Valley's only threat came in the first when catcher Shannon Dolan  singled and Rice walked. Both runners advanced a base on Lovetro's sacrifice  bunt, but Michelle Kravik grounded out to end the inning.  </P> <P> In other league games:  </P> <P> Huntington Beach 6, Westminster 5 -- Freshman Laura Minard (5-6) pitched  no-hitter for six innings to lead Huntington Beach (6-15, 4-5). But she gave up  four runs and five hits in the seventh inning to let Westminster (6-18, 1-8)  back in the game. Jennifer Johnson hit a two-run triple and scored in the first  to give the Oilers a 3-1 lead.  </P> <P> Ocean View 2, Edison 1 (8 innings) -- Jena Sansone had three hits, two stolen  bases and scored the winning run in the eighth to lead visiting Ocean View  (18-8, 6-3). Edison is 7-15, 1-8.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> MUSEUM STUDYING 2ND DESIGN PLAN  </P> <P> The board of the Newport Harbor Art Museum on Thursday night revealed that it  is looking at a second design plan by an architect other than Renzo Piano, who  drew the initial plan.  </P> <P> Trustees would not disclose the identity of the second architect, who was  called into the project three months ago. The board also said that other  designs may be considered.  </P> <P> The board designated Trustee James V. Selna to spearhead efforts to select a  final design for the museum's new building. Selna will consolidate trustees'  opinions on various alternatives for a full board vote on the matter.  </P> <P> Selna said the board hopes to make a choice by early July.  </P> <P> "We need to be sure there is enthusiasm for the design we choose -- from  trustees, from the museum community as a whole and particularly from major  contributors," Selna said. "We need a design that works programmatically and a  design we can pay for."  </P> <P> Trustees have been modifying the original plan by the renowned Piano since it  was unveiled last summer. They said earlier this week that Piano's plan could  be completely redrawn, either by Piano or by other architects, though no final  decisions have been made.  </P> <P> Piano, based in Italy, has been unavailable for comment on the matter. But he  and his local design team, Blurock Partnership in Newport Beach, have been  working with trustees on the modifications, museum officials say.  </P> <P> Piano is aware that a second architect's plan is under consideration, Selna  said.  </P> <P> Alterations to Piano's original plan, which calls for a low-lying,  87,000-square-foot building, have centered on substantial expansion of gallery  space and reduction of the project's cost.  </P> <P> The new museum, scheduled to open in 1993, is to be built on 10 acres promised  by the Irvine Co. at the corner of East Coast Highway and MacArthur Boulevard.

			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Bimec shares fall on warning of rising losses Shares in Bimec Industries were halved from 8 1/4 p to 4p yesterday as the engineering and waste treatment group announced that losses for the year to March 31 would be 'materially higher than that shown at the half-year' and there would be 'a significant excess of liabilities over assets', writes Peter Pearse. At half-time, pre-tax losses totalled Pounds 7.87m (profits Pounds 3m). Mr Barber, the company doctor brought in to replace Mr Sam Smith as chairman and chief executive in September, said that, although Aero &amp; Industrial Technology, the gas turbine combustion company he was most keen to dispose of, had been 'reduced and reorganised into a good company', so far it had not been possible to find a buyer. Accordingly, there had been 'no material improvement in the net cash position, he said, and without Lloyds Bank's support, Bimec would be 'in peril'. It employs 1,000 people, down 500 since he joined.</p>

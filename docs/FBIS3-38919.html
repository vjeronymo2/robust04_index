			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Between Peace and War"] </F>   [Text] The massacre of civilians in Sarajevo last Saturday  [5 February] took Washington and the strong ones in the European  Union [EU] by surprise at a time when, after two years of  regressions and contradictions, the Western powers seemed to be  formulating a joint course toward the confrontation in Bosnia:  The United States had made it clear that its vital interests  were not at stake in the Bosnian confrontation, Chancellor  Helmut Kohl had opposed any form of military intervention either  by air or land, and Britain saw its initial reservations  justified.    The initial reaction by the West to the Saturday tragedy  proved that the dynamic of a blunt clash, of a "dirty war,"  could at any time upset the priorities and planning of  diplomacy: The open wound of the battlefront in the besieged  Bosnian capital means not only terror and blood for the civilian  population but, at the same time, it is a time bomb capable of  blowing up all that has been achieved through difficult  negotiations among the three opposing sides. Therefore, defusing  this time bomb becomes an urgent priority. The fact that not  only the international community but also the Serbian leaders in  Bosnia seem to realize this is a message of optimism.    At the same time, it is obvious that every time the strong  ones in the West are obliged to deal with the feasibility of a  military intervention in Bosnia, an open war front, they add to  the repercussions of every decision they make the potential  confrontation fronts in the Balkan south.    It is clear that even hostilities on the most limited scale  against Serbian targets would give a "green light" to all those  who like to revise the status quo that was formulated with the  Bucharest treaty in 1913: The vision of a Greater Albania and a  Greater Bulgaria, and Ankara's irredentist legacies [ipothikes]  in Bulgaria would cease to be the "worst possible scenario" of  the NATO staff maneuvers on paper and would become the result of  an uncontrolled Balkan complication.    Of course, the planning with which the "12" foreign  ministers  yesterday approached the dramatic developments in Bosnia does  not mean that the nightmare of a general conflagration in the  Balkans has been removed once and for all. This likelihood will  remain open until a final settlement, with the guarantee of the  international community, of the pending issues that emerged from  the dissolution of the Yugoslav Federation.</p>

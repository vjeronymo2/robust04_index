			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Jammu, Jan. 25 (UNI)--Pakistani troops fired five  rockets fitted with time bombs in Poonch areas bordering  Pakistan-occupied Kashmir on Tuesday.    Official reports here said two rockets fell in Betar Nullah  on the outskirts of Poonch town and three exploded at two  different places around the positions of security forces.  However, there was no casualty.    The firing of time bombs with rockets is a new phenomenon in  the Poonch-Rajouri areas near the Line of Control. Experts say  that time bombs are thrown with rockets having solar batteries  which are charged by sun. The bombs explode at fixed time.    Since last week in Poonch-Rajouri areas, about 45 such  rocket  bombs exploded at various places. But these did not cause any  casualty as almost all of these rocket bombs landed in deserted  areas.    The Governor, Gen. (Retd) K.V. Krishna Rao, on Tuesday  accused Pakistan of actively aiding and abetting terrorism in  Jammu and Kashmir.    In his message to people on the eve of Republic Day, Gen.  Krishna Rao said that Pakistan and militant outfits have been  propagating merger of the State with Pakistan or independence,  which were illusory objectives.    He said that Pakistan has not only instigated, trained and  armed the Kashmiri youth to indulge in subversion and sabotage.    The Governor has ordered the release of 167 detenues on the  eve of Republic Day, while the security forces apprehended 20  militants in the Valley during the period, an official spokesman  said.    Meanwhile, intermittent firing by Pakistani troops at Indian  posts in forward areas near the Line of Control continued. Three  civilians were injured in the firing during the past week.    Two people were injured in Poonch district and one in the  Chamb sector of Jammu district on Monday, when Pakistani troops  fired from across the Line of Control.    Security forces have stepped up vigil along the Line of  Control following reports that Pakistan's Inter-Services  Intelligence (ISI) has planned massive infiltration of Afghan  mercenaries who are trained in guerilla warfare and subversive  activities.    The security forces have successfully foiled another attempt  of Pakistani troops to push fresh groups of militants into  Poonch and Rajouri areas for escalation of violence in the State.    Srinagar: A red alert has been sounded in the  Kashmir Valley in view of the militant threat to disrupt the  Republic Day functions, while two militants and a security  personnel were among 10 people killed during the past 24 hours.    Militants lobbed a hand-grenade on a Border Security Force  (BSF) guard at Chadoora bridge injuring three personnel, one of  them died in the Army Hospital.    One militant was killed in an encounter with the security  forces during search operations. Two more militants were nabbed  and arms and ammunition, including two AK 56 rifles, one  universal machine gun, one rocket were recovered.    Meanwhile, day curfew in Kishtwar town of Doda district in  the Jammu region was lifted on Tuesday following improvement in  the overall situation.    Curfew was imposed on Saturday last following the killing of  two people by militants in Dool area, which had caused tension  in Kishtwar and other adjoining areas.</p>

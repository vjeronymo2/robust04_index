			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: Strong demand for Credito Italiano The public offer for the 64 per cent stake in Credito Italiano held by IRI, the Italian state holding company, was closed early yesterday after being over-subscribed six times. The strong response by institutional and private investors will be seen as a lift to Italy's privatisation plans that have been slow to materialise. Credito is the first large public sale of state assets and success is important for the momentum of the privatisation programme at a time of political uncertainty. The offer of L2,075 per ordinary share was launched on Monday at a 9.6 per cent discount, with a sweetener of a 1-for-10 bonus share issue in three years for those retaining their original stake. 'The huge demand from Credito's 800 branches and the 96 banks in the consortium backing the issue have helped accelerate the timescale for the completion of the operation,' the bank said yesterday. At the close of business on Tuesday, over 295,000 orders had been placed for 2.9bn shares, roughly half coming from Credito branches. The bank said that when included with institutional demand more than 5bn shares had been requested against the 840m placed by IRI. Mr Romano Prodi, the head of IRI, said: 'Italy has really replaced deeds with words. Italian savers and institutional investors have understood the importance of an enthusiastic response to the first big privatisation, ensuring the success of the offer well ahead of schedule and by a heavy over-subscription.' The offer was to close at the end of the week and raise L1,830bn (Dollars 1.1bn) for IRI. The discount was lower than that offered by the French government for BNP and Spain's Argentaria. However, a brief but intense advertising campaign encouraging Italians to switch their attention from Treasury bills (Bots) to risk investment on the stock exchange appears to have worked.</p>

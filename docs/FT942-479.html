			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Court backs ban on sex line A telephone watchdog yesterday won a High Court case allowing it to ban an overseas-based telephone sex-chat line. The ruling, which allows Icstis, the watchdog for premium-rate telephone lines, to ban a sex-chat line that advertises in the UK press but is based in Guyana, is seen as an important test case on the powers of the watchdog to regulate foreign-based premium-rate services. An attempt by Icstis earlier this month to ban the line was stopped by a court injunction after Icstis had recommended to British Telecommunications that it bar access to the lines. The line, One to One, claimed that its service was not covered by the watchdog's code of practice. It advertised in the Daily Sport newspaper in contravention of an Icstis ban on the advertising of sex-chat lines in publications other than top-shelf magazines. Sir Donald Nicholls, the Vice-Chancellor, ruled in the High Court that One to One had no real prospect of succeeding in its claim. Sir Donald also lifted the injunction on Icstis seeking to bar One to One's access to BT lines. Under new rules about to be introduced, callers to pornographic phone lines will need a personal identification number to listen in. Adult phone lines are produced and managed by independent operators using lines leased from BT. Premium-rate charges for UK calls are 49p a minute at peak time and 39p off-peak, of which about two-thirds goes to the operator. BT said that its market research showed that more than 90 per cent of customers supported an opt-in for adult services. It already offers customers the option of barring premium-rate calls on their phones. Before the restrictions were introduced, about 700,000 calls a week were made to recorded and live adult telephone lines. The total premium-rate industry was estimated to be worth about Pounds 250m in 1992, with 6m calls made a week.</p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Argentine defence company probed ARGENTINA'S tax department yesterday said it was investigating allegations that a state-owned company had evaded taxes on a large scale. Mr Carlos Tacchi, revenues secretary, yesterday confirmed the department was investigating claims that the company, Edcadassa, had used fake receipts to evade the equivalent of Dollars 1.5m in tax since 1990. The company is 51 per cent-owned by the defence ministry. Mr Erman Gonzalez resigned two months ago as defence minister to lead the ruling Peronist party's congressional election campaign in Buenos Aires, where corruption is a leading issue. The elections are due in October and the affair could offer new ammunition to the opposition. Edcadassa holds, at Buenos Aires international airport, a monopoly over bonded warehouses which the defence ministry has been under pressure from the US embassy and the economy ministry to break. President Bill Clinton is expected to mention Edcadassa's monopoly, and US suspicion of corruption and drug smuggling at the airport, when he meets Argentine President Carlos Menem in Washington on June 29.</p>

			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> CANCERWATCH: News that the state is unveiling a tough anti-smoking campaign  (A3) got a warm reception in Orange County. "It's tremendous!" exulted local  American Cancer Society spokesman Kirk Wilks. Already, he noted, fewer people  are believed to be smoking here (20%, down from 50% three decades ago). . . .  Even so, lung cancer deaths here are up from 645 in 1979 to at least 878 last  year. Lanie Jones and Eric Bailey  </P></p>

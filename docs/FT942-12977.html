			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Santander shares fall on Banesto takeover Shares in Banco Santander, the Spanish banking group, fell 7 per cent in Madrid yesterday after its successful bid to buy control of Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto). Santander is to finance the Pta281bn (Pounds 1.4bn) acquisition - Spain's biggest takeover - partly through a Pta89bn rights issue. The new shares will be offered on the basis of a one for three already held, at a price of Pta2,250, less than half the current market level. Santander's share price dropped by Pta440 to Pta5,710. Banesto shares meanwhile climbed 15 per cent to Pta868, close to their highest point since the Bank of Spain intervened last December. Other bank shares also rose. Santander's Pta762-per-share bid for 60 per cent of Banesto's stock far exceeded most expectations and was well above rival bids from two other banks. The shares come from a recent recapitalisation, part of a rescue operation funded jointly by the Bank of Spain and the private banking system. Mr Emilio Botn, Santander chairman, said yesterday that part of the shareholding might be taken up by associated institutions in the UK and the US. These could include Royal Bank of Scotland, in which Santander holds just under 10 per cent, and New Jersey-based First Fidelity Bancorp, in which it has 24.5 per cent stake. He said Santander intended to keep a stake of at least 40 per cent in Banesto, after offering 8 per cent of the shares to its own shareholders. He said the price was 'absolutely reasonable' and claimed the bank had 'sufficient arguments' for maintaining its AA credit rating. However, the rating agencies IBCA and Standard and Poor's both said they were putting Santander under review 'with negative implications'. Mr Botin said Santander should still be able to increase earnings in line with the trend in the first quarter, when consolidated pre-tax profits rose 9.7 per cent to Pta34.2bn. Banesto was expected to resume paying dividends in 1997 or 1998. Mr Alfredo Saenz, the caretaker Banesto chairman who is being kept on in the job by Santander, said Banesto would focus on standard retail banking activities. Background, Page 29</p>

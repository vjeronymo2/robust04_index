			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BLACK PICKED FOR CITY POST IN WAKE OF BIAS  PROTESTS  </P> <P> After months of protests by the NAACP that blacks are not represented in top  administrative posts in Carson city government, City Administrator Jack Smith  has chosen a black woman, Lorraine A. Oten, as finance director.  </P> <P> Smith said Oten, whose salary range in her new job is $60,000 to $77,000, "was  selected solely on her experience and skills." But he added that he is pleased  that Oten, who is leaving a position as finance director of Lynwood, will add  balance to Carson's administrative team.  </P> <P> "It does something to appease a segment of our community who were crying out  for more representation," he said.  </P> <P> In Carson city government, four white men and an Asian man are the other  appointed department heads. Smith is white and the deputy city administrator is  an Asian man. The elected city clerk is an Asian woman, and the elected city  treasurer is a white woman.  </P></p>

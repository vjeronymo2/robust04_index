			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Arzalluz Calls For Independent Basque </F> Country"]    [Excerpt] Madrid -- PNV [Basque Nationalist Party] Chairman  Xabier Arzalluz stated yesterday that he wants independence for  the Basque Country, although he does "not expect to see it."    In statements made to the Spanish Radio Broadcasting Company  network, the PNV's top leader said that the Basque people could  win this independence if they wished, "but I am a Basque  nationalist, and there are people here -- in the Basque Country  -- who are not nationalists, and what I believe is that what we  win should be won by a clear majority."    Arzalluz showed himself in favor of a "Basque state within  Europe," although he admitted that this is impossible right now,  because there is the Army, which guarantees "that there will be  no dismemberment of what is called national territory."    He referred to Article 8 of the Constitution, which assigns  to the Armed Forces the task of guaranteeing Spain's sovereignty  and independence and defending its territorial integrity and  constitutional order, maintaining that it "is unpresentable."    In his opinion, the reactions to his speech on Aberri Eguna  [Basque Fatherland Day] last Sunday, in which he criticized this  article and described Spain's unity as "a story," are due not to  a misinterpretation but to a manipulation, and added that the  Basque people "have no chance of deciding freely."  <H5>  Resignation </H5>   Xabier Arzalluz said that civil governor of Vizcaya Daniel  Arranz should resign for linking his Aberri Eguna statements  with Monday's attack, and stated that following the things that  were said, there was a need for a clarification by Interior  Minister Antoni Asuncion along the lines of the one made  Tuesday, which dissociated Arzalluz and the PNV from the  strategy of Basque Homeland and Liberty.    "Asuncion is an intelligent man and knows what is at issue,  but 24 hours elapsed before Asuncion spoke, and very grave  things were said here, and the matter of Article 8 of the  Constitution is the least of it," he said.    The nationalist leader said that the harsh reaction by the  PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] to his Aberri Eguna  speech did not surprise him, and added that Ramon Jauregui and  Mario Onaindia began the argument with its partners in the  Basque government.    "We are now arguing with the PSOE, but the grave argument  was  begun systematically by Mr. Jauregui, backed by Mr. Onaindia; it  is they who have led us to this situation."    In this connection, he added that Ramon Jauregui,  "accompanied by Mr. Onaindia, is the man who is stirring up  many things here because of his obsession with the elections."  He also criticized the Basque Socialists for acting in  accordance with Madrid's instructions. "What they do comes by  fax from Madrid. They govern from there to here," he said.    The PNV chairman stated that the Socialists have already  begun the Basque election campaign, and forecast that there will  be no major changes: "It can be taken as an article of faith,"  he stated, "that the PNV will rise, Jauregui -- the Basque  Socialists' secretary general -- will fall, and the People's  Party will rise."    He acknowledged that the future Basque government was not  discussed during his recent meeting with People's Party Chairman  Jose Maria Aznar.    "If the government partner here -- the PSOE -- is presuming  that it can talk with everybody," he said, "and holds talks with  Eusko Alkartasuna [Basque Solidarity] or with Mayor Oreja --  leader of the People's Party in the Basque Country -- which are  overt, moreover, saying that there can be many formulas, and  covertly even with Herri Batasuna [People's Unity Party], you  will understand that we also feel free to talk openly with  anybody."

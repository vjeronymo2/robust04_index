			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Letter to Ukraine's leaders: "Demand of the General </F> Directors of Coal Associations"]    [Text]    L.M. Kravchuk, president of Ukraine    I.S. Plyushch, chairman of the Supreme Council of Ukraine    Ye.L. Zvyahilskyy, acting prime minister of Ukraine    H.S. Surgay, chairman of the State Committee for Coal  Industry of Ukraine    On 28 December 1993 in Lugansk Oblast's city of Antratsit  the  general directors of coal production associations of Ukraine  discussed measures to stabilize work in the sector. Basic  demands, in respect to which a decision at the state level is  essential, were adopted for the elimination of the catastrophic  situation at the coal enterprises.    1. The price of coal and coal products established for  January 1994 must be fixed in dollar equivalent at the exchange  rate of the dollar as of the end of December 1993 and indexed  monthly proportionate to the change in the price of the dollar  in relation to the karbovanets (that is, the price for February  1994 must be established proportionate to the price of the  dollar at the end of January and so forth).    2. The transfer in the first quarter of 1994 to the books of  the local authorities of facilities of the social sphere and,  prior to this transfer, their directed financing from  centralized sources.    3. To liquidate as 1 January 1994 the structure of the  Uglesbyt [expansion unidentified] of Ukraine and transfer to the  coal-production associations the right to independently exercise  the functions of supplies and sale of coal and products of its  conversion in accordance with direct agreements with consumers  and government contracts.    4. To convert coal at enrichment factories in accordance  with  agreements, with the reimbursement of the expenditure on the  enrichment and the right to sell the end product by its  producer. At the demand of the coal-production associations to  transfer the enrichment factories to the associations.    5. To extend loans to the coal industry enterprises in  stable  fashion against standard stocks of commodity and material values.    6. On account of the tardy revision of the price of coal and  coal products and pricing mistakes on the part of the Government  of Ukraine, nonrepayable arrears of enterprises of the coal  sector had formed by the end of 1993. These arrears have  practically halted the production and financial activity of the  enterprises.    We demand that enterprises of the coal sector be relieved of  the current debts.    7. For the restoration of economic and business relations  with enterprises of Russia and other neighboring and distant  states:    a) to liberalize customs legislation;    b) to introduce identical customs rules with states of the  "near abroad";    c) to authorize the state-owned enterprises on their  leaders'  responsibility to ship and receive products, with customs  documents being drawn up at the customs house within a month  from the day of shipment (receipt) of products;    d) to exempt imported production engineering equipment and  materials for the coal enterprises of customs duty and taxes.    8. To provide for the allocation of monetary resources from  centralized sources to pay compensation for length of service to  all working people of a coal-production association before 10  January 1994.    9. To extend coal-export licenses to the first quarter of  1994.    10. To index the coal enterprises' working capital or  allocate long-term soft loans for its replenishment.    11. To abolish the "government order" concept as lacking a  legal foundation and to distribute coal resources according to  direct agreements and government contracts concluded on mutually  advantageous terms.    12. To communicate the response to this demand before 10  January 1994 in our presence in the city of Kiev.    General directors:    [Signed] V.G. Ilyushenko of Donetsugol, V.I.

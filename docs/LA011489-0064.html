			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINTER WORKOUTS;  </P> <P> GET BACK ON THE FITNESS TRACK THROUGH A VARIETY OF INDOOR AND OUTDOOR OPTIONS  </P> <P> Wasn't it only a couple of weeks ago that you swore off sweets, cut back on  calories and vowed to exercise an hour every day? By now, you may be regretting  those New Year's resolutions, and feeling not only out of shape but angry with  yourself for failing -- once again -- to stick with a fitness routine.  </P> <P> The chilly, rainy days of late December and January are not conducive to  fitness programs, but there are ways to stay in shape during inclement weather.  And there are plenty of people out there who understand the problems inherent  in beginning, or keeping to, an established routine during the winter months.  </P> <P> Fitness involves flexibility, strength and endurance. When combined with a  sound nutrition program, a fitness program will enable you to control your  weight; regular exercise promotes a sense of well-being, enhances self-esteem  and can open up a new social network. But before embarking on a regular fitness  routine, see your doctor or a sports-medicine specialist who can evaluate your  present level of physical conditioning.  </P> <P> Why all the concern over fitness anyway? Noted runner, cardiologist and fitness  guru Dr. George Sheehan says: "Your whole life depends on it, and by that I  mean your total life, the person you are: your longevity, your life expectancy,  your creativity, your success at work, your domestic bliss.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Different Attitude  </P> <P> "Virtually everything in your life depends on becoming fit." When you look at  it that way, maybe a fitness program deserves another try -- and a different  attitude. The prevailing opinion these days is that fitness should be fun.  </P> <P> Dr. Anthony Daly, L.A. Clipper team physician, acknowledges: "It really takes  an effort to begin a fitness program; the motivation has to come from the  individual. But you have to find something you like doing or you'll find a  reason to stop."  </P> <P> Personal trainer Jake Steinfeld, host of the "Body by Jake" television show,  agrees. "You have to keep humor in exercise," he says, "and use your workout as  a way to relieve stress, pressure and tension. It shouldn't become a source of  anxiety."  </P> <P> Finding the time to incorporate an exercise routine into an already hectic  schedule without adding more stress to your life may seem impossible, but  Barbara Harris, editor-in-chief of Shape magazine, has a few suggestions. "The  goal is to make fitness a habit that comes as naturally as brushing your  teeth," she says. "Learn to schedule it in; plan your workouts as a part of  your day." She acknowledges that especially for working mothers, scheduling  even one hour to work out can be difficult.  </P> <P> "Be flexible with your time," she suggests. "Hire a baby sitter for an hour  while you exercise, join a health club with a nursery, or exercise to a  videotape early in the morning. The key is to make it fun and to make it  realistically fit into your life style."  </P> <P> It's that life-style aspect of fitness that authorities frequently mention,  incorporating regular exercise into daily life without becoming obsessive about  it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Fitness Life Style  </P> <P> Podiatrist Allen Selner notes: "We don't see as much participation in sports  for sport's sake any more. As yuppies are getting older, sports fanaticism has  evolved to integrating fitness into a life style. People are realizing they  don't have to run six marathons a year; they can participate in walkathons,  family hikes or social bike rides instead."  </P> <P> Despite the mild winter weather we enjoy in Southern California, embarking on a  fitness program -- or even continuing your regular routine -- requires  determination and perseverance. David Rivas, editor in chief of Men's Fitness  magazine, says: "This is a difficult time to get fit because the days are  shorter, the weather is colder and nobody seems to have enough time. It just  seems easier to bundle up and grow a beard."  </P> <P> If hibernating at home all winter sounds even worse than recommiting to those  lapsed resolutions, consider your workout options. Getting out of your den may  take your mind off the weather, improve your outlook and get your body in shape  at the same time.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Several Activities  </P> <P> You can thank triathletes -- those long-distance endurance specialists who  swim, bike and run -- for the new fitness philosophy that working out should  involve several activities. Most triathletes report fewer injuries than  single-sport athletes and greater enjoyment of their varied workouts.  </P> <P> You don't have to train for a triathlon to enjoy the benefits of cross-training  (regular participation in more than one sport). Vary your routine: Take an  aerobics class or work out with weights twice a week, go for a social run or a  family hike on the weekend, walk a few miles with a friend and ride your  exercise bike a couple of mornings. Incorporate fitness activities into your  daily life and begin to think of exercise as a way to get out and play.  </P> <P> The mild winters in Southern California are not nearly as prohibitive as those  back East, but if you don't like the outdoor chill, you can take advantage of a  number of winter fitness options: Join a gym or health club, exercise at home  and learn to dress properly for outdoor winter weather workouts.  </P> <P> Health clubs and gyms -- The facilities and resources available in a health  club far surpass whatever you might reasonably accumulate at home. A range of  weight machines; a full schedule of aerobics, dance and stretch classes; lap  swimming, Jacuzzis and saunas, and, increasingly, longer hours, on-staff  fitness trainers and child-care facilities make health clubs more convenient  than ever.  </P> <P> "Joining a health club is the best way to start a fitness program," Selner  says. "It provides a social network of support and encouragement, which is so  important for beginners. The sociability and improved self-esteem from getting  in better shape will keep them coming back."  </P> <P> Others acknowledge that clubs can be intimidating. Steinfeld refers to them as  "metal jungles," and Daly observes: "Too often people join a health club, but  that's the end of their commitment to fitness."  </P> <P> To avoid this all-too-common dilemma, join with a friend who will hold you to  your commitment. Investigate the club before you join to make sure the  atmosphere, clientele and facilities are in line with your tastes, and take  advantage of the services offered.  </P> <P>  Working out at home -- A new generation of high-tech home-fitness equipment  includes exercise bikes, treadmills, stair-climbing devices, and rowing,  cross-country-ski and weight-stack machines. Sales are booming, according to  Harris. The equipment is beneficial only if you use it. Make sure you like the  workout it offers before you spend your money.  </P> <P> Only a few years ago, the act of hiring a personal fitness trainer was limited  to the rich and famous. While it's still a luxury to pay someone to come to  your home to lead your workout, today more people are finding a way.  </P> <P> "Personal trainers are all the rage," Rivas says. "They make every workout  count. And there are plenty of business people in Los Angeles who make enough  to afford the $100-plus a week. They make it a part of their budget."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Booming Business  </P> <P> Steinfeld, who began by putting celebrities through their fitness paces, says  he now motivates a whole range of clients -- and business has never been  better.  </P> <P> "Exercising at home is the best thing, because there are no excuses," he says.  "You can't say the car broke down, you don't have a blue headband and socks to  match or you don't look good enough."  </P> <P> Although investing in expensive equipment or hiring a personal trainer may be  an extravagance for many of us, home exercise need not be a high-priced  proposition. Morning television offers hours of fitness programming. Exercise  videos and audiotapes take you through an array of well-paced workouts, and  several monthly health-and-fitness publications feature simple-to-follow  exercise how-tos.  </P> <P> To make your home fitness program more fun, exercise with a friend or family  member, listen to your favorite tunes, watch the news or catch up on your light  reading while you work out.  </P> <P>  Outdoor winter-weather workouts -- Running, cycling and walking require only  simple clothing modifications for comfortable year-round participation.  Dressing in layers is sensible and an easy way to accommodate temperature  changes. If you must run or walk at night, wear a reflective jacket or vest for  greater visibility.  </P> <P> Bob Wischnia, senior editor of Runner's World magazine says: "I think people in  California tend to overdress when they run in the winter. When you're running  more than a couple of miles, you tend to heat up." He recommends wearing a  long-sleeved T-shirt, shorts or running tights and a nylon or Gore-Tex shell  when it's really cold or wet outside. The former Californian, who now lives --  and runs all year -- in Emmaus, Pa., adds: "I never wear outerwear unless it's  a hat and a pair of gloves. You lose most of your body heat from your head and  your hands, so you should always keep them warm."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Warm and Covered'  </P> <P> John Howard, former Olympic cyclist, notes: "I find that it just doesn't pay to  get cold. It really diminishes my level of enthusiasm for cycling. So I make  sure to keep my fingers, toes and ears warm and covered. My rides are shorter  and less intense during the winter."  </P> <P> Even if the sun is shining, dress warmly for winter cycling. Howard adds:  "Remember, when you're riding, you create your own wind-chill factor. The  faster you go, the colder it gets."  </P> <P> "If you do get cold and wet," Wischnia says, "the best thing to do is get warm  and dry. You can't catch a cold just from being cold, so take a hot shower or  sit in a Jacuzzi, then put on some dry clothes, and you'll be fine."  </P> <P> Still not sure about the value of getting back on the fitness track? Consider,  then, the further observations of Dr. Sheehan, who states with conviction,  "Exercise and becoming fit will add years to your life." Enough said. Now go  out and have fun working out.  </P></p>

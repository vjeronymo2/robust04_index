			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW UP 7.51; STRONG EARNINGS PROPEL RALLY  </P> <P> Stock prices pushed ahead today, getting a little more mileage out of the rally  that has carried the market to its highest levels since the crash of 1987.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.51 to 2,386.91, bringing its  gain over the past four sessions to 90.91 points.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outpaced declines by a modest margin on the New York Stock  Exchange.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 191.51 million shares, compared to 208.65 million in  the previous session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index gained .57 to 171.70.  </P> <P> Analysts said stocks have drawn support in recent days from spreading hopes  that inflationary pressures might be easing and that interest rates are turning  downward.  </P> <P> Signs of a slowing economy also raise some new worries for investors. For one  thing, some observers suggest, they could lead to heightened concern about the  possibility of a recession.  </P> <P> Brokers said, however, that any such fears were countered today by strong  earnings reports from several prominent companies.  </P> <P> American Telephone &amp; Telegraph stock rose on its report of its 20.6%  increase in first-quarter earnings, as did stock in Philip Morris, which also  posted a strong first-quarter earnings gain.  </P> <P> Microsoft, among the volume leaders in the over-the-counter market, rose when  the company reported that earnings for the fiscal quarter ended March 31 were  73 cents a share, up from 67 cents in the comparable period a year earlier.  </P> <P> Henderson ordered that federal observers be placed on 29 American tuna boats to  make sure that the dolphins were protected.  </P> <P> Bond prices were mostly lower in early trading today, as the market took back  some of Tuesday's strong gains amid sharply rising oil prices.  </P> <P> The U.S. Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue was down about 7/32 point, or about  $2 for every $1,000 in face amount before noon in New York. Its yield, which  moves in the opposite direction from price, rose to 8.95 from 8.93 late  Tuesday.  </P> <P> The market opened lower today after a surge in bond prices on Tuesday after two  economic reports that provided further evidence that the economy is slowing.  </P> <P> Analysts said the market pulled back slightly this morning, partly on  profit-taking and amid surging crude oil prices stemming from an oil and gas  explosion in the North Sea.  </P></p>

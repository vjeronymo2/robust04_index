			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 27 (XINHUA) -- The five principles of  peaceful co-existence, after 40 years of tests in practice, have  shown their strong vitality and become universally accepted  basic norms governing relations between nations.    This June 28 will be the 40th anniversary of the  introduction  of the five principles -- mutual respect for each other's  territorial integrity and sovereignty; non-aggression;  non-interference in each other's internal affairs; equal and  mutual benefit and peaceful co-existence.    With the end of the Second World War, movements of national  independence and liberation flourished in Asia, Africa and Latin  America. Newly independent nations demanded the establishment  of new patterns of international relations based on equality to  maintain their national sovereignty and develop their economies.    The five principles of peaceful co-existence were produced  precisely in response to this strong and common demand of newly  independent nations.    After their rebirths, China and India, two giants in Asia,  established diplomatic relations on April 1, 1950.    On April 29, 1954, the two countries signed an agreement on  trade and communications between the Chinese region of Tibet and  India, introducing for the first time the five principles of  peaceful co-existence into the preface of the agreement.    In June 1954, former Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai visited  india  and Burma at the invitation of the two countries and held talks  with his then Indian and Burmese counterparts, Jawaharlal Nehru  and U Nu.    Consequently, in the "joint declaration of Chinese and  Indian  premiers" issued on June 28 and the "joint declaration of  Chinese and Burmese premiers" issued on the following day, the  five principles of peaceful co-existence were officially  announced as the basic norms guiding the Sino-Indian and  Sino-Burmese relations.    The Sino-Indian Joint Declaration proposed that "these  principles not only be applicable to relations between nations,  but also to the general international relationship," while the  Sino-Burmese Joint Declaration expressed the hope that "these  principles will be observed by all nations."    In April 1955 -- one year after China, India and Burma  initiated the five principles of peaceful co-existence, a total  of 29 newly independent nations from Asia and Africa held the  historic "Asian- African conference" in Bandung, Indonesia.    As a result of the common efforts of the participants, the  conference adopted the "declaration on promotion of world peace  and cooperation" and formulated the 10 principles of Bandung  Conference. These 10 principles, which contained all points in  the five principles of peaceful co-existence, represented an  extension and development of the latter.    Since then, the five principles of peaceful co-existence  have  been recognized and accepted by more and more nations,  international organizations and international meetings; and have  been incorporated into a series of major international  documents, including declarations adopted by the United Nations  General Assembly.    The five principles were also reaffirmed in the documents on  China's establishment of diplomatic relations with more than 100  nations, including Western countries like the United States, and  in treaties as well as communiques China has signed with other  countries.    The world today is characterized by diversities. There are  about 1,000 ethnic nationalities and more than 200 countries,  including more than 180 independent, sovereign nations.    They differ not only in social system and development level,  but also in ideology, cultural heritage, national character and  religious belief.    The past decades have proved that whenever a few countries  in  disregard of the said differences, tried stubbornly to impose  their concepts of value on "democracy" and "human rights" as  well as their social systems on other countries, there would  invariably be unrest and chaos, making such practice utterly  futile.    Similarly, contradictions would be exacerbated and  international tensions heightened if the modes of "big family,"  "bloc politics," "sphere of influence" and "world leadership"  were applied in handling international relations.    With the end of the Cold War, there is no more bloc  confrontation characterized by the contention for hegemony  between the two superpowers.    However, manifestations of power politics still exist in  international relations, marked by the big suppressing the  small, the strong bullying the weak, interference in others'  internal affairs under various excuses, and frequent threats to  apply sanctions and even to use force.    Therefore, it is still a matter of paramount and realistic  significance to firmly uphold and apply the five principles of  peaceful co-existence in international relations.    These five principles have generalized the most basic norms  that govern international relations transcending the limits of  social system and ideology.    Only when international relations are completely based on  the  five principles of peaceful co-existence; the differences  between nations are duly recognized and respected; all nations,  big or small, rich or poor, strong or weak, are recognized as  equals in the international community with the right to choose  their own ideology, social system and the mode of development  suitable for them; and mutual exchange, seeking of common  grounds and keeping of differences as well as mutual  complementation are encouraged, can the nations co-exist  peacefully and enjoy genuine international peace, stability and  development.    In order to promote peace and development, a peaceful,  stable, just and equitable new international political and  economic order should be established on the basis of the five  principles of peaceful co-existence and on the premise of  recognizing the diversity of the world and differences between  nations.    Under such a new order, mutual respect, equality and  cooperation between nations will take the place of hegemonism  and power politics; negotiations and dialogues will replace the  use and the threat of the use of force; and mutual benefit and  mutual supplementation will substitute for trade protectionism  and unequal exchanges.    To realize the goals of the five principles of peaceful  co-existence, the international community needs to cooperate  extensively and make long-term and unremitting efforts.</p>

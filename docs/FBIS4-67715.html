			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" program] </F>   [Text] The State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological  Supervision reports that instances of diptheria quadrupled in  the first two months of this year compared to the same period of  1993. Rubella and whooping cough are up two and a half times.  The main reason is a reduction in the number of inoculations  carried out.    The number of severe intestinal infection and tuberculosis  cases is also rising. The sanitary service has also recorded  that instances of syphilis have more than doubled.</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (39): GUIs bring training advantages - Impact of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) / Much of the pain of learning basic computer skills is removed with graphical user interfaces. They also reduce the learning curve on training staff for new applications software THE GRAPH below shows the dramatic impact of graphical users interfaces (GUIs) on the learning curve for new computer applications. It was first published by Apple Computer a couple of years ago to highlight one of the advantages of the Macintosh personal computer and its innovative GUI software. But following the success of Microsoft Windows, the GUI for IBM-compatible personal computers, the graph has a much wider relevance. It shows that the learning curve for a user getting to know their first application is steep - as one would expect. But when users move on to a new application, the curve is shallower - because they are able to transfer knowledge of one application to another. The skills they have learned in a word processor - like saving a file or re-formatting text - can be used in the same way in a spreadsheet or a desktop publishing package. This is a direct result of the use of standard GUIs and the influence they have brought to bear on applications software developers. By their very nature GUIs are easier to use than previous interfaces. And they force developers to use standard methods of doing things, which works to the benefit of the user. The basic controls for all software applications are the same in a GUI environment - similar to the way that controls on a 35mm camera or a motor vehicle are consistent across different manufacturer's products. This has significant implications for training - particularly in the area of basic IT skills training. In the future, GUIs will help to enforce standards across applications and make both the users' and the trainers' job much easier. Attention can be focussed on the application, rather than on the demands of the technology.</p>

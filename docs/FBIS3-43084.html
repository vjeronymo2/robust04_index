			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vadim Mikhnevich and Igor Polyakov: ``What We </F> Have We Are Saving''; the first paragraph is an introduction]    [Text] A plant is being constructed at Zelenograd for the  production of modern microelectronics. Despite the fact that the  amount of capital investment is estimated at $300 million,  specialists are sure: this sum can be recouped with profit in  three years. This profit will be earned due to the sale of  products in internal and world markets. Discussions of the  preservation and multiplication of national intellectual  capabilities in the high technologies sphere up to now resemble  a dialogue between a blind person and a deaf person. Cries for  assistance come from the camp of scientists and engineers; the  government, which has no money, utters promises and commercial  structures, scratching their heads as where to invest  accumulated capital, lack the foresightedness for evaluating the  essence of high technologies and to understand: a gold mine lies  literally beneath their feet. However sad it is to admit, but  precisely those foreign companies working in the field of  microelectronics (behind which, among others, stand the major  banks) sooner than our fellow countrymen understood that it  would be the height of stupidity to ignore the possibilities of  an enormous scientific-technical complex in whose creation they  would not have to invest a cent. Somewhere slightly correct  something, somewhere renovate equipment, then race for licenses  for products in great demand, using the Russian work force which  is very low cost by world standards. j In essence the only thing  which is saving us is that in the West they know very well the  value of the high technologies, which are called 21st century  technologies. And therefore they are interested in not allowing  the killing of the goose that lays the golden eggs. They are not  interested because world practice has shown loud and clear: high  technologies give a maximum yield only under conditions of an  international division of labor. What this separation should be  is a matter of business strategy. And now we will return to  the Zelenograd scientific-technical complex, which after  becoming a joint stock company, becoming privatized, was given  the name Kontsern Nauchnyy Tsentr [Scientific Center Concern],  the status of a juridical entity and a heap of troubles with  respect to its own future. One of the first who drew attention  to the capabilities of the Zelenograd enterprises was the  American corporation IBM, which is known as the king of the  computer market. It supplied the equipment for the Kvant plant  forming part of the Scientific Center and there organized the  production of personal computers and videomonitors. As they say,  cheap but good. The specialists of this foreign corporation took  a very far-sighted look. They calculated in time that the  enterprises at the Scientific Center were capable on a regular  basis of replacing their company electronic components by  Russian components, concluding that this in no way would exert  an influence on computer quality. Later there was more. It was  found that due to Zelenograd know-how it was possible to  increase considerably the capacity of the computer external  memory, making it suitable for use in computer networks. In the  long run IBM intends in general to afford the Scientific Center  the opportunity to work to the specifications of their clients,  on the basis of Zelenograd computers creating new-generation  information-computer control systems. Another channel for the  Scientific Center to enter into the world market had already  been laid out independently. Its enterprises began to supply  integrated circuits to the markets of Southeast Asia -- again in  conformity to the specifications of the client companies. The  quality of the product was quickly appraised favorably there and  today approximately a third of the production of the ``Mikron''  and ``Angstrem'' plants making up the concern is exported. The  reputation of the delivered products is so high that the clients  pay in advance. Still more interesting for the people at  Zelenograd is the story with China -- it did not begin to  purchase microcircuits, but the equipment produced by the  ``Elion'' plant for the production of microcircuits in order on  its basis to establish a technological base for Chinese  microelectronics. The unique production lines for the  production of microcircuits cost really big bucks and therefore  it is in general not difficult to understand the Chinese  strategy. ``Elion'' offers its equipment considerably more  cheaply and the price differential in no way corresponds to a  loss in quality. The very same thing applies to the delivery of  microcircuits to Southeast Asia. Accordingly, to think that the  Scientific Center has become a foreign exchange millionaire for  the time being is still premature. However, it may very easily  become such if it is possible to broaden the production of  microelectronics and start up the plant which is under  construction. The time required for paying off the 300-million  hard currency credit necessary for this purpose (taking into  account the interest rate of 9-12% prevailing in the  world) is  estimated at three years. If reliance was to be oriented on the  preferential credits within the framework of conversion programs  just the construction of the plant alone would require six years  and during this time there would be a changeover to the next  generation in microelectronics. Turning to world experience of  advanced countries, it is easy to understand: investments in  scientific and practical development work of electronics  companies always have been and remain a profitable business.  And what about our commercial banks? Indeed, if you think it  over, this is a possibility which for the time being they are  deprived. When the shares of the Zelenograd enterprises are  given a quote on the international money market together with  IBM, Motorola, Sony and other companies specializing in this  field, it will already be too late. It is not necessary to speak  of how much the production of the Scientific Center is necessary  in Russia and the CIS. Reference is not to computer production  alone. It is sufficient to recall the quality of our telephonic  communications, worse than which it is perhaps difficult to  conceive. Accordingly, the programs of the Scientific Center  include the modernization of the communication networks of the  Moscow telephone center and the replacement of archaic  electromechanical commutators by high-speed electronic  commutators. For Moscow a project also has been developed for  coinless automatic telephones using plastic cards. Still more  far-going plans call for the development of a supercomputer on  the basis of our own know-how and use of its technical solutions  in the production of high-speed PC's in no way inferior in  quality to similar products from IBM, Hewlett-Packard and other  companies known throughout the world.

			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASEBALL ROUNDUP  </P> <P> In another Bay League game:  </P> <P> Palos Verdes 11, Rolling Hills 4 -- Pat O'Hara and Jason Goldberg each drove in  four runs and the Sea Kings roughed up Rolling Hills' ace Kirt Kishita for five  runs at Palos Verdes to finish in fourth place in the Bay League.  </P> <P> Palos Verdes (15-11, 8-6) snapped a 2-2 tie with five runs in the fifth. Four  of the runs came off Kishita, who relieved starter Tristan Paul with no outs  and a runner on first.  </P> <P> Kishita, who allowed another run in the sixth before being pulled, was pitching  on a day's rest after hurling a three-hitter Tuesday in Rolling Hills'  playoff-clinching 8-2 victory over Palos Verdes.  </P> <P> "Was he ready when I brought him in?" Coach Garry Poe said. "I don't know. The  problem with Kirt is he always wants the ball. He's so enthusiastic."  </P> <P> But Poe said it was obvious that the junior right-hander didn't have his best  stuff. Kishita gave up six hits and two walks, one with the bases loaded, in  his inning of work.  </P> <P> "We teed off on him, didn't we?" said Palos Verdes Coach Gil Eberhard. "I don't  know why we didn't hit the ball the other day."  </P> <P> Goldberg highlighted the Sea Kings' five-run fifth with a two-run double down  the first-base line. They added four runs in the sixth, capped by a towering  three-run homer to right-center field by O'Hara.  </P> <P> A junior left-hander, O'Hara pitched 6 2/3 innings for the victory.  </P> <P> Palos Verdes managed to remain in playoff contention until the final day of the  season despite the loss of two starters. Second baseman Chuck Okada, the team's  leading hitter, was sidelined with a knee injury April 5 and Steve Hoye, the  top pitcher and shortstop, was suspended from the team last week because of a  school violation.  </P> <P> Said Poe: "They did a great job to hang in the way they did. They faced a lot  of adversity."ROB FERNAS  </P></p>

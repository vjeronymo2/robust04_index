			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Slough Estates Another rights issue was scarcely an option for Slough. But yesterday's placing of Pounds 100m of long-dated bonds is nonetheless reassuring for shareholders with the infamous Pounds 170m convertible put now less than 12 months away. At least half the necessary cash is locked into place at current interest rates, and though a spread of 255 basis points may sound a lot, it does not compare unfavourably with equivalent issues from British Land and Hammerson. By all accounts, demand for unsecured fixed income instruments is healthy at the moment, provided that the story line is right. Slough can certainly claim that UK industrial property has not suffered to nearly the same extent as offices or residential property. This does not mean, though, that the year-long slide in the shares has necessarily run its course. At 161p, they are only cheap if the dividend is maintained, which notwithstanding management's determination to do so must remain something of an if. The worry is the company's weak revenue account and the extent to which stated dividend cover depends on capitalised interest relating to the development programme.</p>

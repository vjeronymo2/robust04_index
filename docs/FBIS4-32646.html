			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Communique on the Assassination Attempt in Constanta and </F> the Threat to President Ion Iliescu's Life" issued by the  Greater Romania Party -- place and date not given]    [Text] The Greater Romania Party [PRM] publicly protests  the exceptionally grave events that took place on 3 June 1994 in  the Municipality of Constanta. Being invited to hold our weekly  news conference at the headquarters of the Constanta branch of  PRM, we travelled there by airplane. Upon our arrival at  Kogalniceanu Airport, we were met by the Constanta County  prefect, Mr. Anghel Constantinescu, who reassured us that in  spite of the fact that there were certain brawling groups of  people, the situation was under control. Being invited by the  prefect and a number of county council members to pay a protocol  visit to the Prefect's Office headquarters, we found that there  were approximately 1,000 agitators there, who were blocking the  entrance gate and maintained an atmosphere of terror. We used  the backstairs to enter the prefect's office building, but after  only a few minutes the prefect's office was stormed by a few  dozen hooligans, stinking of alcohol, who tried to force their  way in through the doors and who were threatening to kill us.  Answering our question inquiring about how it was possible that  such aggressors could penetrate the prefect's office building,  despite the presence of the riot police, several local officials  told us that they had been encouraged and helped to fraudulently  enter the building by Cornel Neagoe, the PNTCD [National Peasant  Christian-Democratic Party] mayor of Constanta Municipality,  Stelian Dutu, the chairman of the Constanta branch of the FSN  [Democratic Party-National Salvation Front], who is also deputy  chairman of the Constanta County Council, Alexandru Mihalcea,  the local correspondent of daily ROMANIA LIBERA, and Ion Hasoti,  an ultra-monarchist attorney. As a matter of fact, the four  aforementioned prominent agitators of the opposition stood all  along in the window of the mayor's office, encouraging and  directing the insane mob in the street, who, their eyes blurred  with beastly fury and brandishing chains, crowbars, and knives,  were shouting as loud as they could: "Death for death!,"  "Blood for blood!," and "Get that hangman!"    As the situation was desperate and the county prefect seemed  to be overwhelmed by the events, the PRM chairman [Senator  Corneliu Vadim Tudor] telephoned Bucharest, where he spoke with  Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, Senate Speaker Oliviu Gherman,  and with Interior Minister Doru Ioan Taracila. Within a short  time the police forces were strengthened. Eventually the gang  of hooligans, who had been occupying the hallways, left the  prefect's office building. About 700 PRM sympathizers, who had  gathered at the Culture Palace and were waiting for our news  conference to begin, could hardly be restrained from heading for  the prefect's office building, where -- in their rage at what  was happening -- they would have pulverized that scum within a  few minutes. Owing to those regrettable incidents in Constanta,  under the circumstances of a nearly three-hour siege, Professor  Mircea Musat suffered a heart attack and was unable to attend  the news conference. We would like to mention that among the  mob 50 rogues were spotted who had been brought there from  Bucharest by bus, to act as a Hitler-type assault brigade.  Under such circumstances the PRM demands that the Government  and the General Prosecution should depose and prosecute, in  emergency proceedings, the peasant-party mayor of Constanta,  Cornel Neagoe, a paranoid individual who has publicly stated  that if he had more authority, he would literally bulldoze all  communists. It is obvious that owing to certain characters who  cannot adapt to society, such as Mayor Cornel Neagoe, and  [PNTCD] parliamentarians Vasile Vetisanu, Serban Sandulescu, or  [PNTCD Chairman] Corneliu Coposu, PNTCD is actually an anti-  national, anti-peasant, anti-Christian, and anti-democratic  party. We also demand that all hooligans who, having occupied  the supreme state institution of the county, threatened to kill  the senators and deputies of our party, should be identified and  placed under arrest.    It is alarming and regrettable that, owing to the  inexplicably passive stance of the police and the justice  ministry, gangs of insane people are able to block and hold in  terror the fundamental institutions of the state: The  Government, the Senate, the Chamber of Deputies, the Ministry of  Interior, and the county prefect's offices. For the last time  we publicly warn everyone that if there is no return to legality  and Romanian society is not protected against such aggressive  rottenness, our party, together with other healthy forces of the  nation, will see themselves compelled to set up their own  defense structures, as the lives of our parliamentarians,  counselors, journalists, and ordinary party members are being  threatened.    As far as concerns the recent communique of the FSN  leadership, which they published a number of times and on radio  and television [rejecting Tudor's earlier accusations that FSN  leader Petre Roman was involved in a coup attempt against  President Iliescu allegedly to take place on 17 June], the PRM  has to point out the following: We believe that the FSN is not  entitled to issue any more communiques, because in any country  of the world, parties that have destroyed the country, parties  that are swarming with all kinds of crooks and rowdies, would  have been dissolved and each of its members would have been  prosecuted long ago. Thus, with the same hand with which they  wrote false declarations and forged public documents, with which  they squandered our national patrimony, with which they sent  abroad huge amounts in hard currency and made their relatives  rich, some of the deputies of that drifting party are now  requesting that the parliamentary immunity should be lifted of  the PRM chairman whose sole fault is that of having revealed  their crimes.    The recent escalation of tension was caused by the  disclosures of an authentic revolutionary, who was gravely  wounded in the blaze of the December 1989 events, made to us,  the members of the PRM Steering Committee, who sign this  document. Those disclosures were made on the morning of Friday,  3 June, in the VIP foyer of Baneasa Airport, upon her own  initiative, by Mrs. Maria Schiht, a member of a revolutionary  organization, who before her recent retirement used to work at  Romania's Senate. Here is what she stated to us:    "I have come to warn you that an attempt upon Senator Vadim  Tudor is being plotted. Furthermore, Dorin Maxim, one of the  leaders of the revolutionaries' organizations, recently  disclosed to me that before 17 June, together with [Democratic  Party-National Salvation Front leader] Petre Roman, they will  assassinate President Ion Iliescu and will reinstall [King]  Mihai de Hohenzollern as the head of the country." Considering  the exceptional gravity of those assertions, we advised Maria  Schiht, together with Flori Stoichitescu, her former colleague  at the Senate, who was accompanying her, to request an audience  at Cotroceni Palace with [presidential counselor for military  issues] Colonel General Vasile Ionel and brief him on that  potential violence. We know that their meeting took place. We  invite the General Prosecution to commence serious  investigations ex officio, as stipulated by law.    Under the aforementioned circumstances we request that Dorin  Maxim should be immediately interrogated and that Petre Roman's  parliamentary immunity should be lifted, as that is the sole way  in which justice could precisely establish the nature of his  relations with terrorist-extremist groupings planning to  overturn state order by force. One cannot ignore the fact that  some of the leaders of his party have forced their way through  the lines of the law- enforcement bodies at the Alba Iulia Great  Popular Assembly of 1 December 1993, which proves their  anti-social habits. At the same time the PRM firmly requests  that the General Prosecution should finance the completion and  deal with the penal cases based on the thorough reports of the  Prime Minister's Control Corps, cases referring to the  infractions perpetrated by Petre Roman, Rada Istrate, Bogdan  Niculescu-Duvaz, Traian Basescu, Bogdan Bujor Teodoroiu,  Aristide Dragomir, Adrian Severin, Vasile Bran, and other FSN  [National Salvation Front] leaders, who by their incompetence,  amateurishness, greed, irresponsibility, and Mafia-type dealings  have pushed the country to the bottom of the abyss. Once more,  we sound the alarm so that public opinion at home and abroad  should be entirely aware that the sole extremism currently  practiced in Romania is the one perpetrated by the monarchist  opposition and the FSN, who -- if we wish to prevent them from  poisoning this nation -- should be outlawed as soon as possible.

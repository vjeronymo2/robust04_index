			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Endangered Species Act requires the Services to identify species of wildlife and plants that are endangered or threatened based on the best available scientific and commercial data. To fulfill this responsibility, the Services must have an effective program to identify species as candidates for listing and to assess and monitor their status. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A credible, up-to-date list of candidate species provides a foundation for the Services' candidate conservation efforts. Regular assessment to determine and monitor trends in species' status helps to ensure that conservation efforts, as well as species listings, are appropriately directed and in accordance with established priorities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An emphasis on early conservation efforts for candidate species allows the Services to seek opportunities for Federal and non-Federal entities to stabilize and recover these species and their ecosystems before listing becomes a high priority. By addressing the conversation of candidate species, the Services and other Federal and non-Federal entities can retain management flexibility, reduce conflict with development, minimize the costs of recovery if listing is pursued, and sometimes alleviate the potential need for restrictive land use policies in the future. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Principal components of the draft guidance include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Standard procedures for addressing taxonomic questions regarding candidates; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Standards for acceptance of candidates to administrative categories and documenting changes in the status of candidates; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. An explanation of monitoring requirements and means for carrying them out, as well as a sample format for a monitoring plan; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. An explanation of comprehensive notices of review; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. A description of the overall purposes of candidate conservation actions and a discussion of the authorities and opportunities available to carry out candidate conservation; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Principles upon which to set priorities among species and projects; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. General rules for the development and implementation of Conservation Agreements intended to promote conservation of candidate species; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. An explanation of how implementation of Conservation Agreements might serve to eliminate or reduce the need to list some candidate species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The draft guidance being made available through publication of this notice would supersede the Fish and Wildlife Service's 1983 policy entitled ``Conservation Agreements for Candidate Species_Final Policy and Guidelines.'' The 1983 policy has a much narrower scope than the draft guidance. The draft guidance expands upon the 1983 policy by: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Providing information on how to identify species as candidates for listing, and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Providing direction to ensure that the Service complies with the 1988 amendments to the Act, which require that the status of petitioned candidates be monitored to ensure that they do not become extinct while awaiting listing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the procedures and definitions in the Handbook are supported by both Services, not all are applicable to the National Marine Fisheries Service due to organizational differences between the two Services, as well as differences in the special character of species under the jurisdiction of each Service. Further guidance clarifying National Marine Fisheries Service specific organizational requirements will be included in the final guidance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Public Comments Solicited <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Services intend that a final decision on the draft guidance for candidate species take advantage of information and recommendations from all interested parties. Therefore, comments or suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies, the scientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerning this draft guidance are hereby solicited. All comments and materials received will be considered prior to the approval of a final document. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 --> Author/Editor: The editors of this document are Sandra L.

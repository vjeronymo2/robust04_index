			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "G. Dz": "Two Winners: VLD And Extreme </F> Right"]    [Text] LA LIBRE BELGIQUE-Marketing Unit has released the  results of the first large opinion poll organized for 12 June  European Parliament [EP] elections. The exclusive survey covered  2,000 Belgians, 1,000 from each language community). It gives  an early indication that the elections will also (and above  all?) function as a test the national government and its  majority. The voting intentions follow the trends revealed by  our last "parliamentary" poll at the end of the December.  <H5>  The CVP and PS Are Losing Ground </H5>   Four months from the elections, a comparison of voting  intentions with the 1989 results reveals that two winners are  making significant gains: The first are the Flemish Liberals of  the "new" VLD [Flemish Liberals and Democrats], who gained no  less than 10 points to 27.1 percent. The extreme right is the  other winner. The VB [Flemish Bloc] has broken through the  10-percent barrier among Dutch speakers (10.8 percent compared  with 6.6 percent five years ago) while the National Front and  comparable parties have 5.2 percent among French speakers. On  the Flemish side, the extremist advance has been at the expense  of the VU [People's Union], which is in the process of  disappearing. The Liberal votes have almost all been taken from  the CVP [Christian People's Party], which has dropped 10 percent  (24.1 percent compared with 34.1 percent).    Among French speakers the PS [French-speaking Socialist  Party] is the big loser, under the influence of "scandals" and  governmental participation (a loss of 7.4 percent to 30.7  percent). The poll was conducted between 7 and 15 February.  Arithmetically, the PS's votes could be going to the extreme  right, since Ecolo [French-speaking Greens] (17.2 percent, a  0.6-percent gain) and the PSC [Social- Christian Party] (21.8  percent, a 0.5-percent gain) are stable and the new PRL-FDF  [Radical Liberal Party-Democratic Front of Brussels French  speakers] alliance has achieved critical success only (with 23.9  percent, a 1.2-percent gain from their combined votes in 1989).  <H5>  Happart and Tindemans Lose Ground </H5>   Our poll also covered some leading politicians who are  taking  part in the elections. The leading candidates of the PS and CVP  are losing ground: Jose Happart would lose 88,000 preference  votes and Leo Tindemans would lose 223,000 preference votes  (however, he has Wilfried Martens as his alternate candidate).  Also to be noted is the rise of the VLD's Annemie Neyts (she  leads Flanders' preference votes), the PSC's Gerard Deprez, the  SP's Freddy Willockx and Antoinette Spaak and Jean Gol of the  FDF-PRL (the latter is second among French-speaking candidates,  in front of his PSC rival).</p>

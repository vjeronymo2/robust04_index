			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CELEBRATE GEORGE WASHINGTON, NOT FOR THE CHERRY TREE TALE BUT AS A MAN OF  CHARACTER  </P> <P> This week marks the 257th anniversary of George Washington's birth, this year  the bicentennial of his inauguration as President.  </P> <P> If the thousands of volumes written about Washington were laid end to end, even  that legendary hurler probably could not throw a silver dollar across them. Yet  we do not know the man. We have relegated him to tales of hatchets and cherry  trees, to antiquarian shrines and February sale ads. He is little more than a  purse-lipped visage on our money. By trivializing him, we miss the lessons he  could teach us.  </P> <P> We imagine Washington to have been aloof and stiff. In fact, he was a man of  personal charm and physical grace. These attributes contributed to the majestic  presence that his contemporaries found so impressive. "His person," said Thomas  Jefferson, "was fine, his stature exactly what one would wish, his deportment  easy, erect and noble. . . ."  </P> <P> The Revolutionary War generation feared charismatic figures who could play upon  the passions of the people in order to make themselves dictators. Washington's  dignified and reserved demeanor helped to assure them that they could trust him  with power.  </P> <P> The impression Washington made was no accident. He consciously cultivated a  style that fit the ideals and fears of his contemporaries. He deliberately set  out to persuade them of his trustworthiness. In doing so, he displayed his  genius as a political actor. He was not a hypocritical manipulator or a mere  image created by media handlers. He and his contemporaries believed that a  leader's exterior manner should reflect his interior character.  </P> <P> Ten days after his appointment as commander of the Continental Army, Washington  demonstrated the linkage between his skill at political symbolism and his  trustworthiness. Many Americans feared abuses of military power. History was  filled with examples of popular military leaders who had become tyrants. New  York's revolutionary legislature praised the general's ability and virtue, but  then registered its concern "that whenever this important Contest shall be  decided . . . You will chearfully resign the important Deposit committed into  Your Hands, and reassume the Character of our worthiest Citizen."  </P> <P> Washington tailored his reply to allay the fear of military despotism. On  behalf of his fellow generals, he wrote: "When we assumed the Soldier, we did  not lay aside the Citizen, &amp; we shall most sincerely rejoice with you in  that happy Hour, when the establishment of American Liberty . . . shall enable  us to return to our private Stations. . . ."  </P> <P> This statement was not just shrewd public relations. It set the tone for all of  Washington's future public service. "His was the singular destiny and merit,"  said Jefferson, "of scrupulously obeying the laws through the whole of his  career, civil and military, of which the history of the world furnishes no  other example." Washington's consistent submission to civilian authority and  the laws helped establish an American tradition of civilian control of the  military and constitutional restraints on the use of power. Thus have we been  spared the tragic betrayal of our revolution, so often suffered by other  nations.  </P> <P> George Washington deserves our gratitude for his sense of civic duty, but the  achievement was not his alone. His fellow citizens made it unmistakably clear  what they required of him. Obedience to legal limits and subordination to  elected leaders would win him lasting fame. Abuse of the powers granted him  would bring down everlasting execrations.  </P> <P> Some of us today naively excuse lawless abuses by soldiers and presidential  advisers and Presidents because they were promoting policies that we favor.  Others cynically dismiss such misconduct because "they all do it."  </P> <P> Washington and the revolutionary generation would have found our attitudes  antithetical to the kind of government and public morality they demanded of one  another and labored to hand down to us. They would never have considered  Richard M. Nixon an elder statesman or Oliver L. North a national hero. When we  laud such men or allow them to profit by their violation of the public trust,  when we fail to hold our leaders to the standard of George Washington and his  generation, we betray our civic inheritance. Worse, we betray ourselves.  </P></p>

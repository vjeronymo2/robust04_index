			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Arts: Beguiling Coppelia from LCB - Ballet London City Ballet is back in business - and in more senses than one, thanks to renewed commercial support. After a decade of gallant, and gallantly independent, existence, financial uncertainty forced the company to close this summer for want of serious government subvention. The Arts Council, to whom every lame post-modern duck is a swan, chose to ignore the merits of an ensemble which played 200 performances a year of decent classic stagings to a devoted public. (Perhaps these audiences were not small enough. Perhaps the repertory was not sterile and self-indulgent enough to warrant funding). Sponsorship was the lifeline that sustained the troupe until this July. Honourable closure ensued. Then ADT, the Texaco Endowment, Prospect Charitable Trust and the Sander Gorlinsky Trust, came to the rescue - and how welcome their support. LCB has been revived, and is embarked upon its autumn round of performances with a new and excellent staging of Coppelia. I saw the production at the Churchill Theatre in Bromley on Wednesday. Cecilia Barrett has mounted the hallowed old Russian text (by Petipa and Cecchetti) for the first and third acts; the second is given in Jack Carter's sensitive edition. The result, with Peter Farmer's pretty designs (made some years ago for LCB), is a beguiling, splendidly honest version of the dear old ballet. The narrative is uncomplicated and alert; the dances are infectiously happy, touched with true gaiety of spirit. I know that I have been watching Coppelia since the dawn of time: a presentation as light-hearted and responsible as this - with dancers who are clearly enjoying what they do and are eager to share that enjoyment with their public - makes this ancient charmer still the freshest and best of experiences in the dance theatre. Though LCB can only provide 18 musicians, Delibes' golden score loses none of its power to inspire the action under Daryl Griffith. It sparkled as it should, and a lady seated near me could not resist humming along with its melodies: that it can give such pleasure is part of its magic. The cast was led by Jane Sanig as a vividly happy Swanilda - her characterisation is quick-witted, quick-footed - and by Marius Els, an assured Franz who is also an excellent partner. Terry Hayworth was a jolly Coppelius, yet responsive to the darker moments of the second act; the ensembles were as lively and buoyant as one could wish. It was a delightful performance, rewarding to both dancers and public. LCB must not be placed in jeopardy again. London City Ballet tours Coppelia and a good triple bill this autumn to Swansea (week of Nov. 1); High Wycombe (Nov 8); Croydon (Nov 15); Brighton (Nov 22). Sponsorship is provided by ADT, Texaco, The Prospect Charitable Trust, The Sander Gorlinsky Trust.</p>

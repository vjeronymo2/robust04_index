			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ivan Garcia, Mabel Barreto, Jose Arrieta, and </F> Julia Maria Urrunaga: "The Green Runway"]    [Text] "Vaticano" had two main accomplices: the Shining  Path [SL] during one phase and prominent military officials in  Alto Huallaga during another. However, the drug traffickers will  be tried by the military courts and the commanding officer of  the Army has already stated that no one in the military is  involved.    Landing strip used by drug traffickers in Campanilla: The  encircled area of the photo shows the Peruvian Army's Otorongo  Military Base used for antiterrorist operations. For the past  year, it has been used by small planes carrying drugs to  Colombia in plain sight of the soldiers based there. It was  built by Vaticano.    Although public opinion has for the past two weeks had ears  for nothing but the alleged connections of drug trafficker  Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera with prominent figures in the world  of entertainment, a disturbing question nevertheless keeps  cropping up with respect to this shady individual: Was he or was  he not connected with members of the Armed Forces and Peru's  National Police (PNP)?    Last week, Nicolas de Bari Hermoza, head of the Army, and  PNP  General Victor Alva Plasencia both emphatically denied that  anyone in the military or police has had connections with Chavez  Penaherrera.    Nevertheless, in the midst of the confusion caused by police  arrests of entertainers, stars, a designer and a former beauty  queen, rumors and suspicion that members of the Armed Forces or  the Peruvian Police might be involved in Chavez Penaherrera's  drug trafficking ring continued to grow.    Despite the amount of time that has passed, people still  have  vivid memories of the connections of drug trafficker Reynaldo  Rodriguez Lopez, the "Godfather," with high-ranking National  Police officials still serving prison terms.    So far, statements by (retired) Peruvian Army Major Evaristo  Castillo Aste published in CARETAS last week provide the first  indications that would detract from the categorical statements  made by top-ranking PNP and Army officials to the effect that no  one in the military or Police is involved with Chavez  Penaherrera.    In the jungle, (retired) Major Castillo Aste served first of  all as chief of operations and later military adviser to General  Eduardo Bellido, now political and military head of the Huallaga  Front.    What he said is deserving of an investigation as thorough as  it must be transparent in order to assess the responsibilities  of those serving at and assigned to the various military and  Police bases near the area in which Chavez Penaherrera operated  in Huallaga Valley.    Chavez Penaherrera is unquestionably one of the biggest--if  not the biggest--drug traffickers in the country. There is also  some suspicion about his connections with terrorists in the  area. However, what is particularly troublesome in this case is  that there does not appear to be the slightest interest on the  part of either the military or the Police in investigating  possible cases of corruption committed by members of law  enforcement agencies.    Chavez Penaherrera, aka "Vaticano," has already been accused  of treason on charges of narcoterrorism. His case is being  channeled almost automatically to the military courts, where he  is awaited by a faceless court that will certainly sentence him  to life in prison.    Naturally, when he is turned over to the military courts,  the  regular courts of law will be powerless to conduct  investigations, not only into Vaticano's probable relations with  members of the Armed Forces and the PNP, but also with  nonmilitary and nonpolice sectors.    The following is a thorough examination of the connections  that very possibly link Vaticano with certain military and  Police figures.    The information comes from thoroughly reliable sources and,  as the reader will see, the accuracy and details speak for the  quality and veracity of the information.  <H5>  Looking the Other Way </H5>   Kilometer marker 787 on the Juanjui-Tocache section of  Marginal Highway in the Department of San Martin, which between  1990 and mid-1993 was one of the airports set up by Vaticano to  send cocaine paste (PBC) to Colombia, was not concealed in any  way.    It could not be because located at the end of the  1,500-meter  airstrip used by small planes from Colombia is (now blockaded by  cement barriers and barbed wire) the Peruvian Army's Otorongo  Military Base used for antiterrorist operations. Both the strip  and base are next to the town of Campanilla. The base has been  there, manned by (approximately) 40 soldiers under the command  of a captain, since before 1989.    In other words, there could not have been a single flight,  shipment of cocaine paste, or takeoff or landing by Colombian  planes in Campanilla that was not observed by personnel at that  military base. To deny such complicity, which we shall describe  in further detail below, would amount to saying that a small  plane can land in Lima's city square without being seen by  soldiers guarding the government buildings.    The captains assigned to the Campanilla Military Base (and  who are rotated every three or four months) are not the only  officers responsible. Their chiefs, who visited the base  periodically, could not possibly have been unaware of what was  going on.    Even if they did not observe the landings, when making their  inspections, the officers must have at least wondered what was  taking place on the 1,500-meter strip!    Nor did all the action take place in Campanilla. Nearly all  the runways built or set up by Vaticano were near military  bases. Most were run by the Army, as in the case of Tingo Maria,  Aucayacu, Tocache, Juanjui, Sion, Punta Arenas, Uchiza, Saposoa,  Bellavista, and Palmapampa. The Peruvian Air Force (FAP) now has  its own bases at Tingo Maria, Tocache, Juanjui, Uchiza, Saposoa,  and Bellavista. The Navy has a base at Aguaytia, where a secret  airport also once operated.    The responsibility extends to the highest-ranking officers  in  the Armed Forces in the area: the commanding officers of  Emergency Zone 8 (San Martin and Huanuco) between 1990 and 1993.    According to information gathered by this periodical in the  area and contained in more than one report drafted by members of  the Army Intelligence Service (as on 22 November 1991, for  example), the complicity between the chief of the Otorongo Base  and Vaticano's ring was the result of a financial agreement  involving at least $3,000 to $4,000 a flight. If one considers  that not only the captains in charge of the base, but their  superior officers also consented to the goings-on, then one has  to conclude--and this is the information that circulates in the  area--that these superior officers also took payments and in  larger quantities.  <H5>  Life in Campanilla </H5>   The operation run in Campanilla that turned the town into  the  biggest center for collections and shipments in Huallaga  involved most of its 3,111 inhabitants.    It is perhaps for that very reason that no one wants to  speak  of what was happening in the local streets until only very  recently. It is as if the entire town had suddenly suffered an  attack of amnesia.    However, Army intelligence reports--which no one heeded at  the proper time--and accounts gathered in Juanjui can  reconstruct what the people of Campanilla do not wish to recall:    The activity began at the collection centers. The peasants  went straight to certain homes in town. For example, the house  where Humberto Chavez Penaherrera lived is on the second block  of the Julio Romero Castro section, the street running right  into Campanilla, about 150 meters from the base.    The building belongs to his brother, Emilio Chavez  Penaherrera, who lives on Block 3 of the Alfonso Ugarte section  in Juanjui, where SI found him. He said he has not seen his  brother Demetrio since the latter was 15 and ran away from home  in Campanilla (the Chavez Penaherrera family moved from Saposoa  to Campanilla when Vaticano was 9) and swore he knew nothing  about his other siblings Humberto, Bertha, or Bersabe. "We have  all gone our separate ways and I know nothing about the others,"  he said.    The only thing he admitted was that he has a house in  Campanilla where his brother Humberto lived until his arrest  late last year: "I left it when I came here from there eight  years ago to devote all my time to running my lumber business,"  he said.    Vaticano was not living in Campanilla. He moved to Colombia  in 1990 but returned frequently (for important shipments, it is  said) and stayed at that house when he did so.    His sister Bersabe, also under arrest although it is not  known for what charges, lived across from the Plaza de Armas.    Another collection center may have been Humberto's ranch,  located on the same level as the town but across the Huallaga.  This would mean transporting the product on rafts to the little  port of Campanilla across from the ranch. Lower down on the same  side of the Huallaga lives another brother, Juan II (the Pope is  also named John). According to those who know him, he is very  poor.    The drug was taken from the collection centers to the  airstrip. This meant crossing the river or walking a few blocks.  According to one report from the Army Intelligence Service  drafted by an agent who visited Campanilla near the end of 1991,  the haulers or "handlers" carried it in backpacks. They would  sit down on both sides of the streets and wait for payment or  some scheduled flight. For their part, the chiefs moved about in  pickup trucks guarded by armed hired killers.    As the time for a flight drew near, they converged on the  airstrip to make their shipment. The twin-engine planes brought  the money in dollars. It was unloaded and the drug loaded, some  800 to 1,000 kilos of cocaine paste on every flight. According  to the report and as confirmed by anyone visiting Campanilla,  this all took place "in plain sight of Army personnel."    In order to convert coca leaves into paste, the laboratories  operated in homes or on the riverbanks. When Humberto Chavez was  arrested on 3 December, a lab operating on the bank of the  Huallaga opposite his ranch was raided and destroyed.    All of this movement in town also presumed the  complicity--and paying off--of municipal authorities. The mayor  from 1990 to 1992 was Aprista [American Popular Revolutionary  Alliance] member Guzman Gonzales Rivadeneyra.    But the facilities are different. For Vaticano, Campanilla  was not just his center of operations. It was also the village  where his family had come 30 years ago when it amounted to no  more than a few huts. It is perhaps for that reason that he gave  the mayor $500,000, the latter admits himself, "counting it out  one bill at a time," in order to build things: the Plaza de  Armas, the church, a satellite dish, lights for the town (only  for the streets lining the square), and street repairs, a la  Pablo Escobar.    However, the current mayor, Reinerio Cardenas Isuiza, told  SI  Thursday that all the works were the result of a common effort.  During his term in office, he said, they had received help from  Humberto Chavez only to repair streets and only in the form of  food for the members of the Engineering Battalion: 27 kilos of  meat a day. Like the residents of the town, the mayor recalls  nothing at all about drug operations even though he has lived in  Campanilla for 20 years!  <H5>  Barriers </H5>   In September 1992, after the first news reports appears  concerning Vaticano's activities in Campanilla, the Army itself  joined with the DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration] to install  cement blocks on the runway.    However, that was not the end of the complicity. The  bulletin  distributed by the National Antidrug Directorate (DINANDRO) at  the press conference at which Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera was  presented states that "the barriers were moved at night to the  edge of the runway so the illicit operations could take place  (the landings, loading of cocaine paste, and takeoffs), then put  back in place so as not to awaken suspicion." What did personnel  at the Otorongo Base do while this was going on in front of  their very eyes? Army Intelligence reports state that the  soldiers even got in on the act, loading the bags of cocaine  paste on the small planes and moving the cement blocks.    Only last year, as a result of the intervention of the  Peruvian Air Force detachment stationed in Juanjui, heavier  blocks were moved into place and barbed wire and explosives were  installled. The flights were suspended at Campanilla, but  continued at other strips run by Vaticano.  <H5>  "Duck Man" </H5>   For years, numerous military and police intelligence reports  told of Vaticano's activities in what is known as Medio Huallaga.    According to sources in Huallaga, in 1990 Vaticano financed  the construction of the landing strip in Campanilla with the aid  of the San Martin Development Corporation (CORDESAN) and the  Army.    Officials from Corde San Martin, the miniregion of Juanjui,  and even the Huascaran Engineering Battalion 112 helped set up  the section between kilometer markers 786 and 787 on the  Marginal Highway in order to turn it into the Campanilla airport.    Peruvian Army Major Briceno headed the Huascaran Engineering  Battalion 112 which in 1991 and 1992 had as its task the  reconstruction of the Juanjui-Tocache section of the Marginal  Highway. Campanilla is at the midway point. From the ground it  is easy to see the difference in altitude between this kilometer  and a half and the rest of the highway, which implies that in  its reconstruction effort, the Engineering Battalion left this  section intact.    Once the terrain had been "separated" for the airport, it  had  to be expanded on the sides and leveled for the runway. This was  done by workers hired by the Juanjui miniregion in the CORDESAN  jurisdiction, then headed by engineer Sergio Guerra Chombo.    Adolfo Isuiza, the newsman from Juanjui who was murdered in  August 1992 by Vaticano's hired killers, filed this report in  one of his dispatches to Radio Tropical in Tarapoto.    A confidential report drafted in August 1991 by CORDESAN  confirms the irregularities. The officials involved were Renan  Morales Azpur, head of the Juanjui-Tocache highway  reconstruction project, Tito Perez, head of the Juanjui  miniregion, and the latter's chief, one Rondon.    Both the airstrip and one section of the Marginal highway,  specially equipped, were controlled by Vaticano for the landing  of Colombian aircraft that took off again loaded with basic  cocaine paste (PBC).    According to information received in Huallaga, Vaticano  ended  up operating as many as 240 flights a month. He admitted the  spectacular figure during DINCOTE [Counterterrorism Directorate]  interrogations. Then why did the Punta Arenas BCS not take note  of the affair? The only possible reply: Someone looked the other  way and more.    And yet, Vaticano's drug trafficking operations in the  jungle  did not depend solely on the flights of Colombian planes.    During certain periods, the combined antidrug operations of  the FAP, PNP, and DEA observers prevented the entry into or  departure from Campanilla. Nor is the distance from this spot  and the Colombian border a small one.    However, Vaticano found a solution to the problem posed by  his operations.    Reliable information gathered in Huallaga states, for  example, that in February 1992, there were signs that Vaticano's  clan used Army helicopters to move the cocaine paste from  Huallaga to La Media, an important underground runway located in  Nueva Jerusalen del Erene, Ramon Castilla-Caballococha Province,  in Loreto.    This clandestine airstrip was only a few minutes from the  border with Colombia, meaning it was much easier to get the drug  from Peru at that point.    La Media was raided on 23 March 1993, resulting in the  arrest  of Colombian drug trafficker Manuel Guillermo Ayala Calderon,  aka "Paisa" or "Peter," who in statements to the PNP said he had  had drug trafficking connections with Vaticano.    However, what is most important is the existence of very  precise information detailing how Vaticano could have operated  with prominent military officials in the area.    There are signs that Vaticano was in Lima in February 1992.  During his absences from Campanilla in 1992, his brother Emilio  Chavez Penaherrera, "Gigante," ran the "business." However, the  latter was in constant contact with Vaticano by radio in order  to receive precise instructions, consult with him when  necessary, or send messages to him.    On 24 February 1992, Gigante told Vaticano that "the duck  man" urgently wanted to talk with him.    According to the information obtained and duly  cross-checked,  Vaticano's men used the term "ducks" to refer to Army  helicopters flying between different spots in Huallaga.    Nor is that all: That day, sources in Huallaga say, Vaticano  talked by radio with "the duck man," whose identity reportedly  corresponds to a Peruvian Army officer, one Captain De la  Puente, whose code name in the zone was "Javier."    Other reports state that this officer was reportedly a key  in  Vaticano's relations with other military men.    It is also known that precise reports exist from 1991  pointing to signs of the use of "ducks" by Vaticano to carry the  drug from different parts of the valley to Campanilla.    In 1991, coordination with the military, and specifically  with the chief of the BCS in Punta Arenas at the time, was  reportedly the responsibility of Elias Chavez Penaherrera or  "Lan Chile," Vaticano's brother and lieutenant at the time.    Reports found in Huallaga state that Vaticano paid off  prominent military officials in the zone, both in order to land  small planes on the Campanilla runways as well as for the use of  the "ducks" to carry the drug in complete safety from one place  to another.    There reportedly exists an Army counterintelligence report  stating that this Captain De la Puente supplied Vaticano  helicopters from 1900 at night to carry cocaine paste from  Campanilla and sometimes even to areas near the Brazilian border  (Sion). "The duck man" may have been from the Tarapoto Military  Base or the BCS in Punta Arenas, the reports state.    On 20 February of that same year, Vaticano informed the  Colombian drug trafficker known as "Doctor" that things were  "still going badly" since the "handling" or movement of the drug  and payoffs to military personnel had become very expensive.    Other military men in the area, probably involved with  Vaticano during those years, are EP Lieutenants "Mickey,"  "Cahuide," and "Zorro," their code names in Huallaga.    As one can see, a great deal remains to be investigated with  respect to the military aspects of the Vaticano case.  <H5>  More "Men" </H5>   The same conversation which Vaticano had with his brother  Gigante on 24 February 1992 can provide more clues to the  corruption of members of law enforcement agencies in Huallaga.    Witnesses of the conversation in Huallaga say that Gigante  told Vaticano that the report appearing in different media  concerning the capture by UMOPAR [Mobile Police Unit for Rural  Areas] and the DEA of a small plane carrying 380 kg of cocaine  paste was not accurate. His brother informed Vaticano that the  load seized in Pucallpa ("by the men with green eyes" and "the  men from the red earth") was a sale of 800 kg of cocaine paste  that they had made to the Colombian drug trafficker Mario. If  what Gigante had told him was true, what happened to the  remaining 420 kg?    Another piece of information may be related to this fact.    It has to do with a conversation which Vaticano had on 5  March 1992 with a sister of his in Juanjui ("La Calena" or  Bersabe?).    The sister reportedly told him that the seized drug was in  Juanjui and that the "chief of the place" intended to get it to  Colombia through Tarapoto. Vaticano reportedly had his sister so  inform "Calavera" (Humberto Chavez Penaherrera) so that the  latter, with help from the military, would try to get the  shipment back.  <H5>  Campanilla Defense Front </H5>   In March 1992, Vaticano reportedly ordered, through Gigante,  that the members of his ring in Campanilla not carry rifles,  shotguns, or machine guns, evidence compiled in the area  indicates.    However, he excepted handguns and ordered that if they had  to  be carried, they should be concealed in clothing.    The sources consulted go on to say that Vaticano stressed  that above all, his men should not carry weapons bearing the  Peruvian coat of arms and reportedly told Gigante that he  coordinate with the "engineer," possibly the head of the BCS in  Punta Arenas.    According to different versions given in Huallaga, weapons  with the Peruvian coat of arms could only belong to the Army.    How could Vaticano's men have Army weapons?    The explanation given by sources interviewed state that in  1991, Vaticano promoted the formation of the Campanilla Defense  Front against the SL terrorists and advised the head of the  Punta Arenas BCS to give Army weapons to the settlers, many of  whom belonged to his ring. That year, witnesses say, Vaticano  decided not to go on paying quotas to the Shining Path. The  Campanilla Defense Front was one way to stand up to terrorism in  coordination with the Army.    (This was roughly the time of a confrontation of Vaticano's  band with a Shining Path column. Fifteen terrorists died in the  battle, people in Campanilla say.)    Also according to accounts gathered, Vaticano reminded the  head of the Punta Arenas BCS, through Gigante, that the  collection of payments by small aircraft landing on the  Campanilla strips had been temporarily suspended.    Gigante replied that he had already reminded the officer in  question of that fact, but that the latter went on collecting,  perhaps, he said, because they were soon to transfer him, the  informants consulted in Huallaga say.    Why did Vaticano prohibit his men from carrying long arms,  particularly if they bore the Peruvian coat of arms, and why did  he insist on not collecting payoffs during the early days of  March 1992?    The information available indicates that these measures were  reportedly taken by Vaticano because of a report published on 29  February 1992 by the daily newspaper LA REPUBLICA reporting his  activities in Campanilla and his connections with members of the  Army. Vaticano reportedly did not want to expose himself by  revealing the network he had managed to set up in Huallaga for  his illegal drug trafficking operations.  <H5>  Police Involved </H5>   Other sources report serious clues that might compromise PNP  officials with Vaticano. They allegedly include Major "Che  Gato," one Colonel Bernedo connected with the escape of the  trafficker "Mosquito," son of "Mosca Loca" and Captain Rafael  Lopez, cousin of the first husband of "La Calena," Abel Lopez  Soria. The latter officer's nickname is "Muneco."    It has also been learned that one of the police now  questioning La Calena is supposedly the one who stole and later  sold to Vaticano for $5,000 the report containing everything the  police knew about him up to the time he was captured.  <H5>  1990: Abundant Proof </H5>   The arrest of Colombian drug trafficker "Paisa" or "Peter"  in  March of 1993, who admitted making more than one "deal" with  Vaticano, led DINANDRO to make a thorough search of its files  and records of antidrug operations.    An extensive and detailed police report drafted in April  1993  concerning Paisa's capture in Caballococha contains the search  and seizure on 24 July 1990, drafted by members of the PNP's  Condor Patrol in Campanilla. The report states that the police  entered Vaticano's house, located approximately 30 meters from  the laboratory, which was on the right bank of the Huallaga  River opposite Campanilla. They found the following: seven  plastic bags, each containing 40 kilos of cocaine paste; two  plastic bags, each containing 24 kilos of paste; one plastic bag  containing 16 kilos of paste; two FAL [Armed Forces of  Liberation] cartridge pouches containing 15 shells each; and an  FAL rifle with the serial number sanded off.    The same report goes on to state that: "The expansion of  investigations to obtain more evidence relating to Demetrio  Chavez Penaherrera in illegal drug trafficking (TID) activities  yielded information that the latter has relatives with records  for such activities, Humberto Chavez Penaherrera (aka  "Calavera") in particular. The trafficker was arrested at his  house in the company of Cirilo Cardenas Mendoza and Ausberto  Grandez, along with arms and military equipment, communications  equipment, in a joint EP-PNP operation. The sum of $2,000 was  paid to EP Captain "Alfaro" for the return of 04 FAL; he is a  known trafficker in Alto Huallaga."    What is surprising about this report is not so much the  content of what was found and seized, but the fact that it  confirms the proximity of the dates.    If, on 24 July 1990, a police patrol managed to identify and  then destroy Vaticano's logistical infrastructure in Campanilla,  it is surprising that the following year, he should be promoting  a questionable Defense Front of the People of Campanilla with  the consent and apparent benevolence of the Army and that,  during the early months of 1992, based solely on the information  obtained, he should with impunity be running a vast drug  trafficking network.    There are more than enough reasons for a thorough  investigation of the possible relations of this drug trafficker  with prominent military and Police officials in the zone. To  fail to do so will weaken even further the precarious image  which our country has abroad in terms of its fight against drug  trafficking.</p>

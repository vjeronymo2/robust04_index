			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / International Company News: Weakness in stock market hurts Renown RENOWN, the leading Japanese clothing-maker which recently acquired Aquascutum of the UK, reported a pre-tax loss of Y8.2bn (Dollars 64.06m) for the year to end-December, compared with a profit of Y6.3bn in the previous term. It blamed the downturn on inclement weather and a weak stock market. The company, which was counting on an upturn in Japanese stock prices to help cover the Aquascutum purchase, made in August 1990, now hopes a marketing campaign for the brand will help lift its sales later this year. Overall sales last year fell 1.5 per cent to Y228.18bn, with declines in most clothing lines, including a 4.5 per cent fall in outerwear and a 10.9 per cent decrease in baby wear. Renown said clothing sales in Japan generally had been affected by a series of typhoons during the summer and an unusually warm winter. The company, which had a reputation for its success at zaitech, or financial engineering, reported a loss of Y237m on the cancellation of its tokkin, or specified money trusts. The value of these trusts was eroded by the weak Tokyo stock prices over the past year. Renown also reported an appraisal loss of Y10.42bn on securities holdings, but it recorded a Y29.79bn profit on property sales during the period. In the past, many Japanese companies have relied on playing the stock market to improve profits and raise funds for capital expenditure. However, companies that invested heavily in stocks during the late 1980s are now tempted to realise losses in expectation of enduring weakness in the Tokyo market. Renown is hoping a marketing campaign to lift the profile of Aquascutum products will result in healthier sales in Japan. Instead of relying on its regular sales staff, the company will send sales managers to retail stores to encourage the shops to stock the brand.</p>

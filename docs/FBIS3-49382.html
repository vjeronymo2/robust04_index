He said that the programme of the meeting of Hungarian  representatives, to be held in Komarno tomorrow, had originally  included the establishment of a civic association of elected  representatives of the Hungarian minority, but the Slovak  Interior Ministry had said it would not register such a body.  There was no sense in establishing an body with no legal  competence, Pasztor said.    The meeting was expected to pass a resolution which will  serve as a basis for the programmes of political parties and for  further debate in parliament, he said.    Tomorrow's meeting is open only to elected representatives  of  towns and villages, parliamentary deputies, journalists and  invited guests, Pasztor said. Representatives from all the  foreign embassies in Bratislava and from the Council of Europe  had been invited to the meeting, which would be conducted in  Hungarian, with translation provided into Slovak and English.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on an interview with Hizballah Secretary General </F> Shaykh Hasan Nasrallah by al-Manar Television "aired" on 22  February]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Asked if Hizballah is prepared  for the future in light of the settlement, Hizballah Secretary  General 'Allamah Sayyid Hasan  Nasrallah said: The leadership responsibility dictates that  Hizballah and its leadership study and prepare for all future  contingencies. This is a major concern. As a principal force  and trend in the country, Hizballah is concerned with preparing  for every eventuality. [passage omitted]    Asked about Hizballah's future after the settlement, his  eminence said: Nobody can cancel the trend in Lebanon called  Hizballah. That's one thing. The other thing is that talk of  settlement possibilities is premature. It's in nobody's  interest to discuss how to deal with what will happen if peace  is established. We are not prepared to give an answer to the  intelligence service free.    Asked whether there are differences engulfing Hizballah  ranks, Nasrallah said: Not every one in Hizballah thinks the  same. Views are usually raised. But differences are always  settled through a higher religious authority (al-Marja'iyah].  This constitutes a basic immunity. There is a collective  leadership in Hizballah, so its decision is unanimous.  Asked if there is any connection between the Resistance  operations and the political situation, his eminence said that  the Resistance operations are not subject to any political  circumstances. Consequently, the operations are governed by one  factor: The fighters' capabilities and the field conditions  they face. [passage omitted    On Hizballah's conditions for joining any future government,  his eminence said: We are not hungry for power sharing and thus  we do not seek to enter just any government. Joining or not  joining a government is open to study and debate every time a  government is about to be formed. What concerns us is the role  this government will play, its policy statement, plan, and  credibility. If we can see the program that the policy  statement reflects and that the way the government is made up  gives it credibility and if we find that its program and  statement are in line, not with all our policies, but with the  main issues that we believe in, primarily the liberation and  Resistance, then we will not object to joining it.    Asked if Hizballah might join a government under al-Hariri,  he said: I don't want to rush Hizballah's decision on this but  in my mind and following the 13 September massacre, I don't  think so. We have blamed the executive authority, both the  regime and the government, for the massacre. Both are  responsible. And the government did not behave responsibly  after the massacre. Withholding confidence or submitting a  motion of no confidence in the government at the Chamber of  Deputies is always possible but we must choose its timing  because we are not after a no-confidence motion just to make a  point. We have made our point with something bigger than the  no-confidence motion, and the people echoed it in their slogans  and shouts, which were not politically orchestrated. If we  thought a no-confidence motion would bring down the government,  we would not hesitate to submit it for one moment. We have  raised the slogan of bringing down the government and we  continue in that direction but there are priorities. Because of  the country's delicate circumstances, Hizballah has resorted to  no negative measures or violent methods. We accuse some circles  in power of seeking to cause a collision between Hizballah and  the Lebanese Army; they seek to use the Army to strike at  Hizballah and striking Hizballah means striking at the  Resistance. They are trying to find motives or accusations to  use against Hizballah. The Lebanese authority made commitments  to Christopher during the seven- day war in which the Islamic  Resistance in particular used all its weight, mujahidin,  weapons, and resources. After some time, the Lebanese authority  brought the Army to the area of operations of the UN troops as  part of a clear-cut and explicit commitment. This is not just  newspaper talk; we have complete information that promises were  made to repress and disarm the Resistance.</p>

			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Gloom behind the glamour: Big car makers are following their customers downmarket The motor industry moguls have already checked out of Frankfurt. The circus touches down next in Tokyo in October. Sadly the champagne, the canapes and the elegant hostesses have largely disappeared too - to be replaced by the smell of sweat, stale beer and sausages along the concrete walkways. It is the turn of the customers this weekend to push and crane to ogle the show of shiny metal that the best of the world's motor industry have put on display. More than 900,000 visitors are expected to have elbowed their way through the crush of the endless halls of Frankfurt's biennial motor show, Europe's biggest, by the end of next week. But how many of them will come out and buy? If the industry's wise men are right, 2m-2.5m fewer new cars will leave showrooms across Europe this year, with German sales alone forecast to fall by about 900,000. Four years ago Frankfurt was dominated by green issues and sales were roaring along at record levels. Now every new car has its catalytic convertor, every engine has swapped its carburettor for fuel injection. Recycling strategies are in place. Then two years ago it was safety - and sales were still at a record level. Now everyone has a safety package too, boasting airbags - preferably passenger and driver-side - safety belt pre-tensioners or 'grabbers', anti-submarining seats and reinforced cages for the passenger compartment. So what of 1993? First, the Frankfurt show will be remembered as the moment when Mercedes-Benz and BMW, arguably the world's top two makers of up-market executive and luxury cars, showed the world they were in earnest about diving down to the small car market to try to capture more of Europe's dwindling band of vehicle buyers. BMW's bright-red E1 concept car - a choice of petrol or electric propulsion, a 'greenhouse' roof and about the size of a Ford Fiesta - will not be on the roads for a few years, though it is already being driven inside the showgrounds. In a more restrained shade of metallic blue Mercedes-Benz is unveiling its Vision A 93 small concept car amid floodlights and pounding rock music. Shorter than a Rover Metro or a Renault Clio, with a high roof to allow the engine and gearbox to be located beneath the four-seat passenger compartment, the Vision A 93 is a far cry from Mercedes-Benz's leviathan two-tonne S-Class launched only two years ago. Mr Helmut Werner, who is rapidly emerging as a revol-utionary new chief executive at Mercedes-Benz, is adamant that a small car will be in production by '1997 at the latest'. 'The S-Class was our premium profit producer, but this has changed and we must act accordingly. Our customers are on the move into market segments they have not been in before. They are also buying small cars. We have to be sure we follow our customers.' Frankfurt '93 will be remembered too for aluminium. Audi, the up-market car division of the Volkswagen group, unveiled its near-production concept for a top-of-the-range luxury car with an all-aluminium body. The real thing should be launched next year. 'We have to get away from the spiralling weight of cars,' says Professor Ulrich Seiffert, one of the losers and winners in this year's game of management musical chairs at the top of the embattled VW group. Swept away from the Volkswagen main management board to the VW division by Mr Ferdinand Piech's clean broom at the start of the year, he has just been reinstated as the group's research and development director. 'In the past 10-15 years 150kgs has been added to the average weight of a car. We have to bring the weight spiral down.' And Frankfurt will be remembered for gloom. Seat, the Spanish subsidiary of the Volkswagen group, held its Frankfurt party at the city's Rebstockbad, a fancy complex of swimming pools, water chutes and saunas. Traditionally the party is a fiesta, but this year the evening's highlight of a trapeze artist swinging high above the pool with only the water for a safety net was uncomfortably reminiscent of the predicament of most of the European car industry's top executives. With little visible form of support they are swinging above an abyss of mounting losses, job cuts, restructuring and cost-cutting. It was left to the industry's leading showman Mr Bob Lutz, ex-BMW, ex-Ford, and now president of Chrysler to give the show some old-time razzmatazz with the world launch of the US carmaker's all-new Neon small car. At a recent Detroit motor show he launched the group's new Jeep Grand Cherokee sports/utility by driving it up the steps of the main entrance and in through a plate-glass window. This year in Detroit he dropped his Dodge Ram pickup down from the roof. And in Frankfurt? Now with steely grey crew-cut and the look of a US Marines commander, Mr Lutz turned the Chrysler stand and arena into a giant pin-ball machine, so that the stage could flash up the message that the Neon marked the start of a whole 'New Game' in the world small car market. Most of the car industry does not like the current game very much, but at least Mr Lutz could growl with satisfaction: 'Now that was a real launch.'</p>

			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CITY SEEKS FUNDS FOR HOME REHABILITATION  </P> <P> The City Council is seeking special state funding to provide low-interest loans  to help low- and moderate-income families make improvements to their homes.  </P> <P> "It would give an opportunity to furnish more loans for people in the city,"  said May Hui, acting director of developmental services.  </P> <P> The city is applying for more than $287,000 in funds from the state's Housing  Rehabilitation program. If approved, the money would be available for  improvements such as room additions and new roofs.  </P> <P> The money would enable the city to make about 20 loans of about $20,000 each at  an interest rate of 3%.  </P> <P> Currently, the city offers loans for rehabilitation projects to only low-income  borrowers. Hui said the city will be notified within the next 30 days about  whether the funding has been approved. LYNDA NATALI  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ETHNIC STEREOTYPES IN KCAL 'DICK TRACY' CARTOON SERIES  </P> <P> Re Lynne Heffley's July 5 article on KCAL ("Asian and Latino groups are  outraged by two characters in the revived 'Dick Tracy' cartoon series"): It's a  shame that people spend so much time hunting for ethnic stereotypes. Wouldn't  the time be better spent teaching their children not to hate or hurt?  </P> <P> My 12-year-old son has a neurological disorder known as Tourette's Syndrome.  This is a disease (not a form of retardation) that is controlled by medication.  His teacher has made a valiant effort to educate his classmates (and their  parents) about his disorder. But still my son has to cry himself to sleep over  one word: retard.  </P> <P> I was raised with violent and ethnically stereotyped cartoons, but I had one  advantage. I was raised with a conscience. All parents have to do is teach  their children the difference between right and wrong. Then we wouldn't need  stereotype hunters anymore.  </P> <P> SHERRI MENDOZA  </P> <P> West Covina  </P> <P>  KCAL on July 6 decided to discontinue broadcasting the "Dick Tracy" cartoon.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Cost trimming that is part of the furniture: FT reporters investigate who will bear the brunt of the price effects of devaluation in five sectors that affect the retail prices index. Will it be retailers, consumers, UK manufacturers or suppliers abroad? THE general manager of Hartman UK, Mr Alistair Walker, does not mince words when giving his view on the impact of devaluation on the furniture and furnishings industry: 'It's been like a kick in the nuts.' Hartman UK is a subsidiary of a Dutch-based group which imports and distributes garden furniture from the Netherlands. The 'kick' has been Pounds 100,000 - a net loss directly attributable to the exchange rate  - which will leave Mr Walker's company 'breaking even this year rather than making a profit'. Kicks are also being absorbed in the domestic furniture and furnishings sector. Mr Philip Wain, company accountant in the fabrics division of Parker-Knoll - which supplies fabrics woven in British and French mills to department stores around the country - says: 'So far we have taken the hit - about Pounds 40,000 - ourselves without passing it on.' Throughout the industry distributors and manufacturers are absorbing the extra costs rather than raising prices. If prices have moved, it has been downwards in the midst of the recession and stiff competition. At Peter Jones in London, a Hartman table was on offer at Pounds 159 this week compared with Pounds 175 last summer, an example of the discounting that has happened in many department stores recently. The knock-back effect devaluation is having on foreign companies is illustrated by Business Furniture Holdings, a British company which sells office furniture. Prior to devaluation the company was importing Pounds 180,000 worth of door hinges and steel shelf supports annually from Austria and Germany. It has switched Pounds 140,000 of this to a UK supplier, and Pounds 10,000 to an Italian supplier. Mr Ivor Bloohn, managing director, estimates he has achieved a 9 per cent reduction in costs. Silent Night is another company that has achieved small price reductions with its foreign suppliers - between 2 per cent and 3 per cent on bed fabrics from Belgium and beech slats from Germany. For all the juggling, Silent Night admits it has had to pass on the impact of devaluation to the consumer. According to Mr Barry McKenzie, the company's finance director, the price of some of its bed products have increased since September by between 2 per cent and 3 per cent. Such increases are the exception rather than the rule in the sector, but manufacturers, distributors and retailers warn that it could become more widespread if sterling remains at its current level and/or there is an upturn in demand. Mr Walker speaks for his sector when he says: 'No one in the long-term can bear more than a 20 per cent devaluation without passing it on . . . If sterling stays as it is for the foreseeable future, our pricing policy will have to change . . .I think March time could be the crunch.'</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Observer: Deputy deflector Politicians on Poland's Catholic right may soon regret the removal of the censorship that went with communism. Some of their number, along with rivals on the left, are allegedly among the dozen or so parliamentary deputies seduced last summer by authoress Marzena Domoros, who has now named as well as described her apparently effortless conquests in a 140-page typescript. True, it has yet to find a publisher. Although it was originally commissioned by the fast-growing publishing house BGW, the company's chief, Roman Gorski, has decided not to bring it out. But the decision is unlikely to stifle the ambitions of Domoros, a striking blonde, who gained entry to parlia- ment by claiming to work for Figaro. She wrote the book, she says, 'so that people would know why deputies are absent from the chamber during important debates'. Since Poland has yet to experience a high-level public sex scandal, no one can forecast the effect of publication on the electorate. Perhaps, like the French, the Poles might admire politicians with exciting private lives. In any event, however, the left-wing deputies Domoros deflected from their duties stand to suffer less from her revelations than her bedfellows on the opposite side. The Catholic right is just preparing to battle for a statutory ban on abortion.</p>

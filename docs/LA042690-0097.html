			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL SCREENINGS: 'CABIN IN THE COTTON' SCREENS IN MICHAEL CURTIZ  RETROSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> FILM: UCLA ARCHIVE HONORS HUNGARIAN DIRECTOR GYULA GAZDAG; TWO OF OSCAR  MICHEAUX'S WEAKER EFFORTS OFFERED IN THE SERIES AT THE FOUR STAR.  </P> <P> When Bette Davis became the first woman to receive the American Film  Institute's life achievement award in 1977, she ended her heartfelt acceptance  speech saying, "As I say good night, I would like to quote my favorite line  from all of the pictures I have made: 'Ah'd love to kiss ya but ah just washed  mah hair!' "  </P> <P> The first of the famous Davis lines occurred in "Cabin in the Cotton" (1932),  which screens today at 5:30 p.m. at UCLA's Melnitz Theater as part of the UCLA  Film Archive's "Directed by Michael Curtiz" retrospective.  </P> <P> Today the film is virtually forgotten except for that line, but "Cabin in the  Cotton" is far from the kind of campy item that Davis' remark suggests. It  instead belongs to the Warner Bros. cycle of socially conscious dramas and  stars Richard Barthelmess as a serious, dutiful Southerner, the son of a  burned-out sharecropper. The local plantation owner (Berton Churchill) takes  him under his wing but expects him to become his toadie in return.  </P> <P> An expose of the feudal exploitation of tenants by planters, "Cabin in the  Cotton" is hard-hitting and authentic to the extent of showing blacks to be  worse off than poor whites -- and even reveals the whites' casual racism.  Adapted by Paul Green from a novel by Harry Harrison Kroll, the film becomes  very much a message movie, but Davis undercuts its preachiness as Churchill's  uninhibited, shallow blond daughter who comes on strong to the shy Barthelmess,  who is the recipient of the famous line, expressed throwaway style.  </P> <P> "Cabin in the Cotton" is talky, often stagy but largely entertaining. "Cabin in  the Cotton" will be followed at 7:30 by a "Critic's Choice" presentation of  Richard Rush's "The Stunt Man" (1978), with Rush and Gentleman's Quarterly  critic Kenneth Turan leading a panel discussion.  </P> <P> On Saturday at 7:30 p.m., the archive honors Hungarian director Gyula Gazdag,  currently a visiting professor at UCLA, and his film "Stand Off" (1988). If you  missed it at the AFI Fest, it's well worth catching up with this film that is  at once as suspenseful as Hitchcock and a devastating expression of the  frustration that has since erupted into revolution all over Eastern Europe. The  film opens with a father ordering his son Zoltan (Ary Beri) to get rid of his  punk haircut; the son retaliates by having his head shaved.  </P> <P> Before we or anyone in the film realizes it, Zoltan, a tall, rangy youth of  about 18, and his younger brother Istvan (Gabor Svidrony) have taken hostage 16  girls in a dormitory in a student hostel in a Hungarian border town. Zoltan  demands a flight out of Budapest -- and a million dollars. "There isn't a  million dollars in all of Hungary!," exclaims one of the captives, but Zoltan  dreams of "London, Paris, night life -- freedom forever!"  </P> <P> In the grueling battle of wills that ensues between Zoltan and a shrewd  lieutenant colonel (top Polish actor Zbigniew Zapasiewicz, best-known for  Krzysztof Zanussi's "Camouflage), we learn that the boys are the sons of a  pompous, authoritarian frontier guard (who of course taught them to be  sharpshooters); we learn from the boys' bitter mother that the family is much  hated in the community, as is every soldier or party official's family.  </P> <P> There's a terrific you-are-there documentary quality to this intense and rueful  film, in which Oscar-winning Hungarian director Istvan Szabo turns actor in a  key role and which has a rich, dramatic score by Istvan Martha reminiscent of  Bernard Herrmann.  </P> <P> "Lying Lips" (1939) and "The Girl From Chicago" (1932), which screen today at  1:30 p.m. in the Black Talkies on Parade film festival at the Four Star, are  not among black pioneer filmmaker Oscar Micheaux's better films, to put it  kindly. Melodramas with musical interludes, awkwardly constructed and  amateurishly acted, they yet are stirring expressions of black middle class  aspirations. The first exposes the predicament of nightclub entertainers who  are expected to prostitute themselves after hours, while the second condemns  the numbers racket.

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Centre Re buys Sedgwick arm Centre Re, the Bermuda-based reinsurer, yesterday further strengthened its connections with the Lloyd's of London insurance market when its CentreLine subsidiary acquired Mendip, a Bermudan subsidiary of Sedgwick, the insurance broker. Like CentreLine, Mendip is an underwriter of 'time and distance' policies, a form of specialist financial reinsurance used by Lloyd's syndicates to manage their reserves more effectively. CentreLine will pay up to Pounds 30m for Mendip, which will increase its total time and distance assets under management to some Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn). The consideration is payable in cash on completion - which will take place not later than September 30 - except for a deferred sum of Pounds 8.6m, payable in nine annual instalments to December 31 2002, with the amounts varying between Pounds 600,000 and Pounds 1.3m. Mendip's profits for 1993 were Pounds 1.7m and its net assets at that date amounted to Pounds 18.2m. Its total assets and liabilities at last December 31 were Pounds 337.7m and Pounds 319.5m respectively. Sedgwick said the proceeds would be used to reduce group borrowings but group profits would not be materially affected. Centre Re, now wholly owned by Zurich of Switzerland, has a number of other connections with Lloyd's. It provides reinsurance for Integer, a stop loss reinsurance scheme for individual Lloyd's Names. The company is also involved as a reinsurer in a corporate capital scheme designed by Insurance Indemnity Services which aims to provide some Pounds 80m in capacity for up to 86 syndicates.</p>

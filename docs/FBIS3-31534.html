			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Czech Deputy Prime Minister Jan Kalvoda ended his  visit in Great Britain on 19 February. In his talks with State  Secretary at the Foreign Office Douglas Hogg, the situation in  Bosnia was discussed. On his arrival in Prague, Jan Kalvoda  told the Czech radio the following.    [Begin Kalvoda recording] Two days ago, I was assured that  the determination of Great Britain, which is an important  member, is unshakable. I think that in this situation -- once a  decision is made and declared, it has to be carried out. I am  not really exhorting anybody to any kind of shortcut or violent  solution of a situation which can be resolved by negotiations,  but nowadays, all political negotiations have their content, a  degree of effectiveness, and it would be very harmful to accept  a principle of never using force as a means of sanction against  the use of force in mutual relationships. I only confirmed that  our attitude has been stated by authorized representatives of  the Czech state at an international level, expressing in  principle our support for the NATO decision to use bombing if  the ultimatum fails, with the proviso that no rational person,  nor the alliance, would consider the bombardment of Sarajevo to  be a panacea for ending the tension and war in the former  Yugoslavia. Certainly not. [end recording]</p>

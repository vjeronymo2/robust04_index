			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Queen drawn into Tory wrangle over Europe THE QUEEN was last night embroiled in the Conservative party's internal wrangling over Britain's future in Europe as she prepared to deliver her first ever address to the European Parliament in Strasbourg today. A draft speech, reflecting a more positive UK approach to the Community, was the focus of controversy as Buckingham Palace and Downing Street struggled to maintain the monarch's aloofness from the party political fray. In the original draft, the Queen was understood to dismiss differences in national parliamentary traditions as 'insignificant' when set against the European commitment to reconciliation and democracy. Her text was also said to commend the European Parliament for playing 'an ever more important part' in building common interests between the EC nations. However, last night it looked likely that the final wording of the speech will be altered to avoid offending Conservative Euro-sceptics, angry at the erosion of British parliamentary sovereignty to EC institutions. The last-minute flurry over the speech was a vivid reminder of continuing political sensitivity surrounding Europe as Mr John Major attempts to reposition his government as enthusiastic to Europe before taking up the EC presidency in July. Next week, however, the government must face down a backbench rebellion in the Commons, opposing the integration of last December's Maastricht treaty on closer European union into British law. Tory opponents of the Maastricht deal, which includes enhanced powers for the European Parliament, are due to meet tonight to plan their strategy. Last night, the anti-federalist Bruges Group said that while it believed no royal trespassing into the political arena was intended, it was concerned at any suggestion that parliamentary differences were unimportant. Mr William Cash, a leading Conservative Euro-sceptic, said it was 'utterly irresponsible' of whoever had written the draft to portray the Queen as indifferent to the significance of Britain's parliamentary traditions. Government officials had said the speech had been written by the Queen's private staff in consultation with the Foreign Office. By early evening, however, Buckingham Palace was disputing that interpretation, underlining that it was drafted in close collaboration with the Foreign Office and Downing Street and bore a similar status to a Queen's Speech to parliament. Later, Downing Street attempted to play down the controversy by insisting that the reference to 'national parliaments' had been taken out of context. 'There is no suggestion of trivialising national parliaments,' it said. The government had hoped the Queen's speech would defuse the row between the UK and its EC partners over London's refusal to lift all immigration controls. Yesterday, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, warned Brussels that the plan would provoke a growth in far right groups and threaten social stability.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by E. H. Kemp] </F>   [Text] Cape Town April 18 SAPA -- The Pan Africanist  Congress [PAC] is prepared to enter a coalition with the African  National Congress to prevent the National Party [NP] gaining  power in the Western Cape, PAC National Executive Committee  member Barney Desai said on Monday [18 April]. Speaking at a  press conference in Kenilworth, Cape Town, he said such an  alliance was possible only after the elections because the PAC  wanted to test its support at the polls.    "The fate of the Western Cape cannot be left in the hands of  a minister whose generals are involved in gun-running," he said.    Mr Desai questioned the ANC's commitment to its  Reconstruction and Development Programme and claimed the party  had given the International Monetary Fund an undertaking to  restrict the national budget deficit to six percent of gross  domestic product.    Social reconstruction and development would require much  more  state spending, he said.    "We must not make false promises to our people. They will  reap the whirlwind when people see that the promises are not  being met."    Mr Desai said South Africa had to create wealth to finance  social development, instead of borrowing from the IMF and World  Bank.    PAC Western Cape premiership candidate Patricia de Lille  appealed to the state attorney to charge and bring to trial PAC  officials detained in connection with the St James' Church and  Heidelberg Tavern massacres. "Although the PAC and the Azanian  Peoples Liberation Army [APLA] condemned these atrocities, it  suited the state and the media to create the impression that the  PAC and APLA were responsible."    She questioned the perception that coloured people held the  balance of power in the Western Cape. She said a census of the  region's black population was based on aerial surveys, not a  proper count.    Mrs de Lille accused the ANC and NP in the Western Cape of  "exploiting for their own selfish political gain deep-rooted  racism and prejudices which had been created over many years".</p>

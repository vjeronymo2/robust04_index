			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (5): Book-your-own trend catches on - Travel agencies discover they are not indispensable Some large US companies have begun to ask a question which should be giving business travel agents sleepless nights. The question is this: 'Can't we book our own flights and hotel rooms?' International hoteliers confirm that some large companies are approaching them directly rather than through their business travel agents. IBM, the US computer group, makes its own arrangements with large airlines and then simply gets its travel agent to implement them. A company called Business Travel Contractors - which groups large US concerns such as General Motors, Merck and Black &amp; Decker - plans to use its buying power to get better rates from the airlines. For their part, the airlines would not pay any agents' com- mission. They would also not give business travellers from the companies concerned any frequent flyer points. Companies which decide to make their own arrangements are not the only problem that business travel agents face. Those companies - the vast majority - which still rely on conventional agents for their needs are increasingly insisting that they want to be represented by the same organisation throughout the US, or throughout Europe, or even worldwide. Travel agents without worldwide rep- resentation are finding it difficult to win business from some of these multinational clients. Another pressure on travel agents is the need to invest in information technology. Only the most advanced computer systems can provide travel agents with the information that they need to service customers on a worldwide basis. The realisation that it did not have sufficient mass in crucial areas of the world was one of the main reasons why Thomas Cook, the UK-based group, decided to withdraw from offering business travel services. Thomas Cook is owned by Westdeutsche Landesbank. This meant that under US banking regulations it could not offer business travel services directly in the US. The Thomas Cook name in the US was controlled by a franchisee, Mr David Paresky. Thomas Cook also balked at the cost of investing in additional information technology. Last month, Thomas Cook sold its business travel operations to American Express, which also acquired Mr Paresky's interests in the US. American Express paid a total of Dollars 375m to Thomas Cook and Mr Paresky, though it refused to reveal how the sum was divided between the two parties. Thomas Cook said it would now concentrate on its remaining businesses: leisure travel, travellers' cheques and foreign exchange. The American Express- Thomas Cook deal was the second large consolidation in the business travel sector this year. Last March, Carlson of the US and Wagonlit of France announced that they had decided to combine their business travel operations. The two groups said that Carlson's strong presence in the US would be combined with Wagonlit's extensive European interests. Given the threat from several large corporations to take care of their own business travel arrangements, some industry observers see the emergence of two large groups - American Express and Carlson Wagonlit - as a classic defensive move designed to achieve greater control over a declining market. Both groups strongly contest this argument and say that if they are having sleepless nights, it is only through excitement at the opportunities that lie ahead. Mr Eric Brannan, senior European vice-president of American Express business travel operations, says talk of companies making their own travel arrangements is over- blown. The number of com- panies which are large and experienced enough to strike their own deals with airlines and hotels is small. Even if a company were to use its buying power to negotiate a group discount with a particular airline, it would find it difficult to discover whether it could have negotaited an even cheaper deal from a rival carrier. Mr Brannan says: 'No airline is going to tell you that another airline can sell you tickets more cheaply. Only a travel agent can do that.' He argues that the deregulation of the airline industry in the US has made it even more difficult for companies to discover what the best deals are. Future airline dereg- ulation in Europe will make finding the cheapest fares an even more complex task. He adds that for companies to make their travel arrangements themselves would run counter to one of the most significant business trends of the past decade: companies contracting out peripheral services to concentrate on their core businesses. Mr Colin Rainbow, commercial director of Carlson Wagonlit, says his group's enlarged global representation is already producing new business. He says that clients of Wagonlit in Europe have now asked the merged business travel group to handle their arrangements in the US. Similarly, Carlson clients in the US have asked the group to make their business travel arrangements in Europe. Mr Brannan admits that companies are not finding it easy to appoint a single business travel agent worldwide. Many have done it throughout the US but companies are only now starting to appoint a single agent for Europe. Even appointing a single European agent can cause problems, he says. National subsidiaries in Europe often have a high level of autonomy and resent being told what to do by head office. Nevertheless, Mr Brannan estimates that he spends about 20 per cent of his time talking to clients who are trying to arrange their travel across Europe through a single agent. To compete, Mr Brannan says, agents have to go beyond booking hotels and airline tickets. They have to prove to clients that they can offer them an increasingly high quality of information on their business travel practices. An essential tool in collecting the information is a plastic card. By offering business travellers a charge card as part of its business travel service, American Express has a means of collecting spending data for clients. The importance of being able to offer clients a plastic card is recognised throughout the industry. Thomas Cook cited not being able to offer its own plastic card as another important reason for leaving the business travel industry. Carlson Wagonlit concedes that it, too, will have to offer a plastic card as part of its service. Mr Rainbow says the group is negotiating with card issuers.  -------------------------------        THE TOP TEN GROWTH      BUSINESS DESTINATIONS  ------------------------------- Destination         Growth (%)  ------------------------------- Riga                     341 St Petersburg            291 Faro                     204 Maastricht               156 Bombay                   139  ------------------------------- Minneapolis              117 Ottawa                    89 Tel Aviv                  82 Kuala Lumpur              76 Malaga                    73  ------------------------------- Source: American Express  -------------------------------        TOP TEN BUSINESS          DESTINATIONS  -------------------------------   1994                   1993 ranking                ranking  -------------------------------    1          Paris       1    2       Brussels       2    3      Frankfurt       4    4      Amsterdam       3    5       New York       5    6         Dublin       6    7          Milan       7    8         Munich      13    9     Dusseldorf       9   10         Madrid      11  ------------------------------- Source: American Express  -------------------------------</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Purchase helps Wyko contain downturn WYKO, the West Midlands-based distributor and manufacturer of bearings and power transmission components, saw pre-tax profits drop by nearly 10 per cent and acknowledged the fall would have been sharper but for the acquisition of EW Bearings. Performance improved in the second half, enabling the group to announce profits of Pounds 1.38m for the year ended March 31 1992, compared with Pounds 1.52m. Turnover rose from Pounds 48.4m to Pounds 55.5m. Earnings per share, on capital enlarged by the share issue to finance last October's purchase of EW Bearings, were 2.37p, against 4.2p. However, the dividend, with a final of 1.4p, is maintained at 2.8p after taking Pounds 238,000 from reserves. Mr Philip White, chairman and chief executive, justified the maintenance of the dividend as a reflection of future trading prospects, and on the grounds that the balance sheet was strong - gearing fell over the year from 59 per cent to 24 per cent. The acquisition of EW Bearings led to both expansion and rationalisation of Wyko's UK distribution network, which increased its operating profit while that of the UK manufacturing and international divisions declined. Group operating profit of Pounds 1.33m (Pounds 1.53m) would have been less than Pounds 950,000 without EW Bearings. This year Wyko expected further benefits from the rationalisation of the UK distribution network although Mr White said 'demand is patchy' and that 'there are ebbs and flows in the recovery process.' Although he was 'a little more optimistic than pessimistic' about the immediate prospects, he noted that 'it is probably more realistic to accept that prevailing business circumstances were unlikely to improve significantly during 1992.'</p>

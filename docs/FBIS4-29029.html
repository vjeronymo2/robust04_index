			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 15 (YONHAP) -- The presidential office  has gone on alert -- this time not to counter North Korea but to  soothe a South Korean public shaken by the shadow of war.    The stock market plummeted over 19 points Tuesday on the  announcement of North Korea's withdrawal from the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Pyongyang's pledge to go to war  if necessary in case of U.N. sanctions.    Food hoarding has begun as anxious shoppers thronged  supermarkets to stock up on groceries and the country held a  large-scale mock war drill on Wednesday.    The presidential office has made an inner judgement, based  on  around-the-clock monitoring of the North Korean military and the  border, that there are no clear signs of a coming war. But  presidential aides decided it was time to take action when food  hoarding and other signs of creeping war anxiety emerged this  week.    Chief Secretary Pak Kwan-yong called in all senior  presidential aides for a meeting Wednesday morning to seek input  on how to provide assurances on the country's security  capabilities while administering a dose of reality on imminent  U.N. sanctions against North Korea.    Presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik said after the meeting  that all participants agreed sanctions will not lead to  immediate war as North Korea has suggested, but that they are a  means to draw Pyongyang back to the negotiating table to resolve  the nuclear crisis.    In other words, they decided the people must realize that  North Korean leader Kim Il-song and his regime will resort to  dialogue only when they are taken to the edge of the cliff, Chu  said.    At the same time, they wanted to build up public confidence  and the government's credibility in terms of national security,  he said.    "Some people are buying up instant noodles and rice because  they are inclined more toward the North Korean war rhetoric that  sanctions mean immediate war," said the spokesman. "We want to  convince the people that although the public and the government  do stand ready for the possibility of war, they have to behave  calmly so that they don't jumble up the entire distribution  network."    But equally important, the public must be made to understand  the exact situation on the Korean peninsula and what is  happening on the North Korean nuclear problem so that they can  be ready for even a 0.1 percent chance of war, according to  officials.    The sources said the meeting's participants held the foreign  media partly responsible for South Koreans' war anxiety, citing  the arrival of special news teams to cover the tense situation  and exaggerated coverage of what is really going on.    President Kim Yong-sam personally instructed the Foreign and  Defense ministries to keep reporters briefed on all changes so  they can relay the news to the public, and the two ministries  are expected to carry out the instruction from Thursday.</p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / S African all-race poll date set SOUTH AFRICA would go to the polls on April 27 next year in its first all-race elections under a proposal put forward last night by a multi-party planning committee in the country's democracy negotiations. The 10-member committee presented a draft resolution proposing the date to a 104-member negotiating council which will debate the issue. Under the resolution, the council would recommend this date to the higher level negotiating forum due to meet on June 25. 'We believe (setting a date) is vital to inject confidence into the negotiation process,' the resolution said. 'It will send a ray of optimism and hope through the country.' Such a date is likely to be merely a target, however. It would be conditional on agreement in the multi-party talks on an interim constitution. But it will have a psychological impact in a country desperate for signs of a political solution with a promise of stability. It does not seem likely that a date on its own, however, would trigger the lifting of international economic sanctions. This would require agreement on an interim executive council to oversee government in the run-up to elections. Mr Joe Slovo, South African Communist party leader mandated by the ANC and its allies to introduce the election date resolution, earlier accused some of the negotiating groups of delaying tactics. 'There is a lot of filibustering, there is too much filibustering going on, some of it deliberate to stall the process.' A government delegate also expressed anger at slow proceedings. But other parties were more cautious. 'Unless we move on the question of the form of the (future) state, violence and constitutional principles, there's no point in setting an election date,' a delegate from the conservative Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party said. Progress was made on Tuesday when Inkatha appeared to accept that a final constitution should be written by an elected constituent assembly. However, this later seemed in jeopardy after the party said its central committee had rejected this concession. Both Mr Slovo and Mr Benny Alexander, general secretary of the radical black Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), condemned the presence outside the conference building of about 150 uniformed white ultra-rightists of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement (AWB), some heavily armed. The PAC and the government adjourned another bilateral session yesterday over a police swoop on PAC members last week and the PAC's refusal to renounce armed struggle. There was no indication of any agreement between the two sides.</p>

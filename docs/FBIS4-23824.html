			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Joao Fareia, spokesman for Nampula's Provincial  Elections Commission, said yesterday that there are many  Tanzanians who live along Nampula Province's coastal region, but  they are there purely for commercial reasons and not to take  part in the Mozambican elections.    Fareia, who was speaking at the end of a restricted session  of the commission, confirmed that two Tanzanians tried to  register at one of the centers in the capital of Mossuril  District. They produced their passports, but then changed their  minds after being briefed on who was supposed to register.  Fareia's remarks come in the wake of allegations by Mozambique  National Resistance's political delegation in Nampula that many  Tanzanians were reporting to registration centers in the Isle of  Mozambique and Mossuril.

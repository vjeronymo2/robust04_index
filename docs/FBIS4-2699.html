			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Tsao Hsun-piao (2580 8113 1753): "Deng Xiaoping Again </F> Rectifies the Behavior of Senior Leaders, Recommends Two  Generals Help Jiang Zemin Control the Armed Forces"]    [Text] Deng Xiaoping turned up in Shanghai during the  spring festival, and his senile state was a breath of cold air  for people on the mainland. Many people are discussing the  topic: What will happen in China when Deng dies?  <H5>  Deng Once Again Rectifies the Behavior of Senior Leaders </H5>   Deng Xiaoping arrived in Shanghai at the end of November  last  year, just as the senior level in China was vigorously carrying  out activities to commemorate the 100th birthday of Mao Zedong.  These activities were not planned to be on such large scale  when the senior level of the CPC made arrangements in May of  last year. By last September, CPC elders Chen Yun, Peng Zhen,  and others directly intervened and decided at short notice that  the scale of the commemorative activities must be expanded. The  demand by Chen, Peng, and others was: Mao Zedong was the  creator of New China and the founder of the CPC, and today's  China is a continuation of China's revolutionary yesterday and a  development of the undertaking initiated by Mao Zedong; this  history cannot be cut apart. We are all Mao Zedong's students,  and what we are doing are the things which Mao Zedong wanted to  do but failed to do. We must carry out education of this kind  for the broad masses, establish the high authority of the CPC,  and establish the authority of the third generation of CPC  leaders with Jiang Zemin as the core.    It was against this background that the senior level of the  CPC launched activities to commemorate the 100th birthday of Mao  Zedong in an extraordinary scale, and praises for Mao Zedong  rolled like great waves, while some "leftists" within the party  who had ceaselessly attacked reform and opening up on the  mainland through various pretenses in recent years, also took  the chance to "give vent to their anger" and voiced their  grievances against the policy of reform and opening up. One of  their methods was to blur the difference between the Mao Zedong  era and Deng Xiaoping era, obscure the difference between the  "socialism" before the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC  Central Committee and the "socialism" after the reform and  opening up, cover up Mao Zedong's serious theoretical and policy  failures and the great disasters they brought to the Chinese  people, and attempt to recreate "the fairy tale of Mao Zedong."  The wild performance by the "leftist" forces within the party  was naturally resisted by persons of various quarters, as well  as the people on the mainland. Among the senior leaders of the  CPC, Wan Li, the former chairman of the National People's  Congress Standing Committee, refused to attend or participate in  any activities "commemorating Mao Zedong." Many conditions were  conveyed to the Deng Xiaoping Office, and Deng Xiaoping  asked after hearing them: "Is Deng Liqun (people call him the  underground general secretary) very active? This is a chance  for him! It is quite reasonable to say that the things we are  doing today are the things which Chairman Mao wanted to do but  failed to do in the past, but it is neither thorough, nor  accurate. We should say that today we have done many things  which were not thought about by our predecessors, or even things  they were against, otherwise, there is no need for us to replace  "take class struggle as the key link" with "take economic  construction as the center," or to replace the planned economy  with the market economy, or to emancipate minds, seek truth from  facts, and address false cases and miscarriages of justice, or  to practice reform and opening up. We must grasp the  opportunity to carry out reform and promote development, and at  any time and under any condition, things must obey this overall  situation, and the commemorative activities in this time must  also pay attention to this problem." Ding Guangen, head of  the Propaganda Department, relayed this remark to CPC General  Secretary Jiang Zemin, and immediately made arrangements for  various CPC news units to shift the central task to publicizing  implementation of the "decision" by the Third Plenary Session of  the 14th CPC Central Committee. Therefore, shortly after the  new year, the activities commemorating Mao Zedong ended  abruptly. This may be seen as Deng Xiaoping's  rectification of the behavior of senior CPC leaders.  <H5>  Deng Recommends Two Generals Help in Grasping the Army </H5>   But Deng Xiaoping's health and energy are not as good as  they  used to be, and he is unable to look at many important issues.  A person who knows the inside story disclosed that  recently Deng's words and deeds have shown some delicate  changes, one of which is Deng has dropped the habit of  "disregarding majority opinion" in doing things and paid  keen attention to the opinions of the several old men who are  still healthy in the party, and increased interactions with  them. A particularly obvious change is that he had once become  estranged from Wan Li, but he recently went to talk to Wan Li  several times, and asked Wan Li to improve relations with  Jiang Zemin and Li Peng. He also asked Jiang Zemin and Li Peng  to "take more initiative and have a more harmonious relationship  with Comrade Wan Li." This spring festival, Jiang and Li  each went to Wan Li's residence to greet him, and this is one of  the signs.    Second, Deng is concerned about Jiang Zemin's role in  the Army. Recently, he recommended Chief of the General Staff  Chi Haotian and Deng Office Director Wang Ruilin help Jiang  Zemin to grasp army work. The rumors that Chi Haotian will  be promoted to the post of vice chairman of the Central Military  Commission, and Wang Ruilin will serve as general secretary of  the Central Military Commission have kept coming, and it is  estimated that this is linked to Deng's arrangements. This move  shows Deng's worries about the current situation of the Army.  It has been alleged that, since the Yang brothers were stripped  of their posts in the Army, there have been big changes and  adjustments within the Army, and the ability to coordinate among  major military regions, among various arms of the service, and  between the Central Military Commission on the one hand and  major military regions and various arms of the service on the  other hand, has decreased; and because Zhang Zhen and Liu  Huaqing, who are responsible for helping Jiang Zemin, have not  served in important posts within the Army, plus the fact that  both of them have reached advanced age and therefore it is  difficult for them to personally oversee the daily work of the  Army, the only way to strengthen the Central Military  Commission's command and coordination abilities is to let Chi  Haotian and Wang Ruilin take up important posts at an  appropriate time, to fill the power vacuum between the senior  and lower levels of the Army. It is still not known when Chi  and Wang will take up new posts. There may still be some twists  and turns. But will such a move bring down Jiang Zemin's  "highest authority" within the Army? However, without such a  move, it is not easy to stabilize the Army. The abovementioned  situation shows that Deng is spending more energy on  political stability and party unity in preparation for the days  when he is no longer around.  <H5>  Can the Authority of the Third Generation Be Established? </H5>   Deng Xiaoping and other political old men of the CPC have  reached a consensus: To maintain political stability in the  days when they are no longer around, the most important thing to  do is to establish the authority of the "leaders of the third  generation with Jiang Zemin as the core." However, like any  country which is ruled by a single party, the decrease in  authority of the central leadership seems to be a law without  exception. Under the current condition that the political power  of the CPC is relatively concentrated, establishment of highest  authority often depends on personal ability and charisma, but in  the situation whereby many political old men are still alive and  the promotion of reform and opening up leads to decentralized  and diversified decisionmaking, the basic elements for training  personal ability and charisma do not exist. Judged from the  process of birth of the third-generation leaders of the CPC,  they "suffer from an inherent shortage." For example, they had  to take the stage hastily and did not have outstanding work  merits.    At present, Chen Yun's health is obviously better than Deng  Xiaoping's, and people are generally concerned that if Deng  Xiaoping passes away before Chen Yun, then Chen Yun will  actually become the top man in China's political arena. Will  China's reform and open- door policy then be rolled back a bit?  Will the personnel structure and power pattern of the  "third-generation leadership" remain unchanged? When Chen Yun  turned up on a public occasion in Shanghai this spring festival  to make a speech, there were two points which were very  eye-catching: He stressed the need to establish the "authority  of the CPC leadership with Jiang Zemin as the core," saying that  without such authority great things cannot be done; second, he  said that development must correspond to the country's strength,  and construction scale must not exceed the country's current  ability to sustain it. These two points in fact are an old  point of view he has clung to for many years, namely, the need  to strengthen the central leadership's planning and control over  economic work. It seems that this idea of Chen Yun now enjoys a  dominant position at the senior level of the CPC, whereas Deng  Xiaoping's remark that "Shanghai can go even faster" which he  made in Shanghai, and his basic advocacy of "development is the  last word" and "go faster if one can" do not sound as pronounced  and prominent as Chen Yun's idea.  <H5>  Zhu Rongji Is Under Increasing Pressure </H5>   According to analyses by persons close to the decisionmaking  organs at the senior level of the CPC, the critical problem  affecting the central authoritative status of Jiang Zemin and  others is not that they do not have adequate power, but their  lack of ability to use power, as well as the declining rallying  power of the traditional political system. This year has seen  the highest number of important reform measures announced by the  senior level of the CPC in more than 10 years, and the width and  depth of the reform are unprecedented. Judged from the reform  plans that have been announced, we should say that they are  comparatively reasonable and correct in terms of a basic way of  thinking and framework. But to implement these plans, there are  obstacles and difficulties in terms of time, condition, means,  and so on, and if these problems are not properly handled, the  reform will change direction and shape, or even lead to the  result that the old system returns.    Many economists point out that the basic way in which the  mainland promotes reform plans is the model of top-down  administrative orders, and the goal of reform is to decentralize  decisionmaking power and build an orderly, standardized, and  indirect macroregulation and control system on the premise of  strengthening market economy mechanisms. However, the current  practice is that the central leadership is ceaselessly gathering  and centralizing power, restraining the vigor in localities and  enterprises for economic development, and restricting the  decisionmaking-power decentralization which is needed for the  formation of market economy mechanisms. Between the means of  reform and the goal of reform there emerges a relatively big  conflict. Speaking in terms of the order of formation of market  economy mechanisms, the building of a state macroregulation and  control system should be a "post-market behavior." First there  should be growth of a market economy, then there can be the need  and condition for building the state's macroregulation and  control functions.    Amid the reform and opening up on the mainland over the  past 10 years or so, development of the market has just begun,  the framework of the old system has not yet completely  disintegrated, and many economic relations have yet to be  straightened out and established according to the principle of  the market economy. Under this condition, using administrative  organization and means to establish state macroregulation and  control functions will not lead to an outcome which is identical  with the goal of reform. When trying to handle the  above-mentioned contradictions, the senior level of the CPC,  especially Zhu Rongji, who is in charge of the economy, has met  with pressures and criticisms which increase in an unprecedented  scale.    However, the perplexity currently facing Zhu Rongji is not  the contradiction between reform and the forces against reform,  but the contradiction between different ways to promote reform.  On the one hand, this kind of contradiction shows that on the  problem of how to promote the reform, it is necessary for  various quarters to support one another and coordinate among  themselves, and to have a process of "grinding and integrating,"  compromising, and eventually reaching consensus. On the other  hand, it also shows that within the framework of the traditional  political system of the CPC, when the political authority of the  old generation retreats and the political authority of the new  generation has not yet been established, to ponder problems and  do things, the traditional way in which everyone marches in the  same pace once an authoritative order is given, can on longer be  used. More help should be sought from the democratic style of  consultations with various quarters, exchanges on equal footing,  and mutual compromises. Regarding this point, people hope that  Zhu Rongji should have more awareness, because people pin more  hopes on him than other figures.  <H5>  The Authorities Put Stability in the First Position </H5>   This year, China's reform and development duties are heavy,  and its social, political, and economic environments have  contradictions and perplexities which are more serious than  those in the past. Inflationary pressure continues to increase,  the spreading tendency of corruption has not been effectively  checked, the situation of law and order is deteriorating, about  half of state-owned enterprises are losing money or are in a  semi-stoppage state, and the "debt chains" of some 370 billion  yuan have once again pushed a majority of state-owned  enterprises into a financial and debt dilemma, while the number  of unemployed and job-waiting staff and workers rapidly  increases, tens of millions of rural laborers move in a  disorderly manner to various parts of the mainland, and all  these might lead to serious social unrests. Properly solving  and handling these problems and ensuring accomplishment of  reform and development duties is a serious test to the authority  of the senior level of the CPC.    The CPC's work principle this year is to uphold "reform,  development, and stability" simultaneously; judged from the work  procedure, it has put stability in the first position. For the  sake of stability, both reform and development must pay a  relatively big price in terms of "reducing speed." The  senior level of the CPC recently decided that, for the need  to stabilize the overall situation, the reform plans to be  announced this year must be slowed, and their contents must be  adjusted, and some polices must be amended while one or two  policies must be suspended. If some reform plans are not  accepted by the society when they are announced, they should be  shelved. Therefore, the general situation on the mainland this  year will not be reform and development "on the doubt;" at most,  in the area of reform, it can only be the adjustment of pace,  mediation of contradictions, accumulation of strength, and  preparation work. In the area of development, it can only be an  effort to decrease the inflation rate, suppress the scale of  capital construction, continue to carry out adjustment of  industrial structure and product mix, and control the  development speed within 10 percent, so as to avoid big  fluctuations in economic development. 24 February 1994</p>

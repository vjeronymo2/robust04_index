			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jean-Pierre Olivet: "Alcatel Restructuring Its </F> Optoelectronics Forces..."]    [Text] Optoelectronic components are strategic for  many of the group's subsidiaries. The world's number one in  telecommunications is federating its optical activities, thus  preserving its technological independence and making its entry  into the free marketplace.    Alcatel's optoelectronic components are now prospering and  are highly regarded. The group is combining its activities and  creating a specialized subsidiary, Alcatel Optronics. The new  company will employ 290 persons and has set its goals at a  revenue of 250 million French francs [Fr] and a sales growth of  20 percent in 1994.    A streamlining had become indispensable. The group's  capabilities had become numerous and too dispersed. Alcatel-CIT  is a major player in underwater communications system  components. Several of its Marcoussis Research Center  laboratories are highly reputed for their developmental work in  optoelectronics. Its German subsidiary SEL has been active in  this sector for many years.    Based at Nozay, in Essonne, Alcatel Optronics will be  responsible for the group's activities in the development,  manufacturing, and commercialization of optoelectronics  components. Its ultramodern plant will produce the active  components (lasers and photodetectors) whose production until  now has been split between its Marcoussis and SEL's German plant  sites. The latter will henceforth concentrate on passive  components (multiplexers), while the Lannion plant will do the  assembling and testing of products designed for underwater use.    In thus bringing all of its skills in this sector into a  single entity, Alcatel affirms the strategic nature of  optoelectronic technologies. Alcatel's president, Pierre Suard,  has always kept a close watch over the group's technological  independence..., especially in its core specialties. With optics  becoming the heart of telecommunications, Alcatel, the world's  number one in telecommunications finds it unacceptable to be  dependent upon American and Japanese suppliers for its needs.    Alcatel Optronics will supply the needs of the group's other  subsidiaries in the fields of transmission (Alcatel-CIT, SEL,  Telettra, Alcatel Network Systems) and, tomorrow, switching  (Alcatel Bell and Alcatel-CIT). "Our objective is to cover the  quasi-totality of the group's needs, versus the half that is  currently being covered," says Philippe Bregi, Alcatel  Optronics's commercial and marketing director.  <H5>  20% to 30% of Sales To Be Outside of Group in </H5>  5 Years    Beyond its captive markets, consisting of the group's  subsidiaries, the company has decided to enter the world market  in optoelectronic components for telecommunications, thus  positing itself as a challenger of AT&amp;T, which currently has  15  percent of the world market, and Japan's NEC, Hitachi, Fujitsu,  and Mitsubishi (between 10 and 12 percent), and finds itself  running neck and neck with Hewlett Packard (8 to 10 percent) and  outdistancing Ericsson and Northern Telecom (5 percent each). In  the minds of Alcatel Optronics's management, the objective is  clear: Within 5 years, 20 to 30 percent of its sales must be  outside of the group. This will double its revenue.    In the optoelectronic components sector, as in that of  conventional semiconductors, one of the factors making for  success is large-scale production.  <H5>  Nozay's Production Capacity To Be Quintupled </H5>   In April, the first optoelectronic components will be  rolling  off of Alcatel Optronics's ultramodern Nozay plant's production  lines. Although its capacity is still being kept secret, the  unit's 6,000 square meters--with its 140 employees--is virtually  certain to enable the company to quintuple its present  production rate. For this site, with its Class-100 clean rooms,  the engineers have chosen a process using slices of  organometallic compounds (InPAsGa) 50 mm in diameter instead of  the 12.5 mm wafers previously used. This will enable the  manufacture of 12,000 lasers on each slice. After being  produced, assembled, then tested, these laser semiconductors,  photodetectors, and optical amplification modules will be used  in fiber-optic transmission systems, both terrestrial and  underwater. The components that will constitute the heart of the  optical PABX's, on which the group is currently working, will  also be produced at Nozay.</p>

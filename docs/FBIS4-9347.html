			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From BTA's 21 April "Press Review"] </F>   [Excerpt] Sofia, April 21 (BTA) -- The press gives  prominence to the request for overflying Bulgaria which the  command of the UN peacekeepers in Zagreb addressed to the  Bulgarian Government but withdrew later. The UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] command asked permission for the passage of  an Ukrainian aircraft carrying Finnish blue helmets in  connection with the rotation of UNPROFOR units along the air  route Skopje-Helsinki-Skopje.    According to unofficial information published in the private  daily STANDART NEWS, the question was not about Finnish  peacekeepers, but about the replacement of the Swedish  contingent recently transferred from Macedonia [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] to Gorazde.    The private paper KONTINENT reports that the request for  using Bulgaria's airspace was received at the Bulgarian Foreign  Ministry's Consular Department on April 15, the day when the  National Assembly allowed a single passage of a UN convoy to  from Romania to Macedonia. The letter from Zagreb is said to  have requested a permanent permission for using the route,  KONTINENT says.    According to TRUD, the daily of one of the major trade union  amalgamations in Bulgaria, Prime Minister Lyuben Berov was told  about the letter as late as on Tuesday [19 April]; it took the  Foreign and the Defence Ministries three days to formulate their  positions. The prime minister is said to have authorized the  Minister of Justice Petur Kornazhev to notify the Presidium of  the National Assembly (comprising the Chairman, the three deputy  chairmen, the chairman of the parliamentary Legislative  Committee and the floor leaders of the parliamentary groups)  about the overflight request.    DEMOKRATSIYA, the daily of the Union of Democratic Forces  (SDS), accuses Prime Minister Prof. Berov of being five days  late in notifying parliament about the letter.    DUMA, the daily of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP),  cites  the declaration which the BSP leadership and its parliamentary  group circulated yesterday [20 April] on the same issue. The  declaration insists that the Consultative Council for National  Security be urgently convened and reproaches President Zhelev  for being "inactive when vital issues of the national security  are concerned".    The private daily OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK quotes SDS MP's whose  names are not specified as saying that "Bulgaria is a member of  the UN, therefore it have got to meet certain specific  commitments; refusing to do so would be taken to mean that this  country supports the aggressor".    "The ever more persistent attempts to use the territory of  Bulgaria and its airspace reveal a simple tendency towards this  country's close involvement with the actions of the world  organization in the explosive regions of its western  neighbours", the KONTINENT editor-in-chief writes. He wonders  if it has ever come to the mind of any statesman or politician  to ask what happened with Bulgaria's request for a transport  corridor across Serbia to ship its tomatoes and fruit, which is  quite different from the request for transporting armoured  personnel carriers. "The settlement of this problem also depends  on the United Nations. All we have heard from them so far is  mumble and requests," he notes. [passage omitted]</p>

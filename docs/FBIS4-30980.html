			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva,June 2 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb President  Radovan Karadzic who arrived in Geneva around noon Thursday to  attend talks on the settlement of the Bosnian crisis told the  TANJUG correspondent that the Serbs had come to conclude peace.  The Bosnian Serb delegation also includes Bosnian Serb Vice  President Nikola Koljevic, Parliament Speaker Momcilo Krajisnik  and Foreign Minister Alkesa Buha. The Commander of the Bosnian  Serb Army General Ratko Mladic and his associates also arrived  with the political delegation.    In his statement to TANJUG Koljevic said that the proposal  of  U.N. special envoy for former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi on the  delimitation of the territories between the warring sides is  expected to be tabled at the talks which are scheduled to begin  Thursday afternoon.    The proposed model is very similar to the one applied in the  disengagement of the forces of Croatia and the Republic of Serb  Krajina (RSK), Koljevic explained. The buffer areas will  perhaps be called gray areas in which peacekeepers would be  deployed.    U.N. special envoy Yasushi Akashi, international mediators  Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] commanders for ex-Yugoslavia and Bosnia Generals  Bertrand de Lapresle and Michael Rose have also arrived in  Geneva but there is still no confirmation about the arrival of  the Bosnian Moslem delegation which is supposed to be headed by  Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic. The Croatian delegation headed  by Kresimir Zubak has also arrived in Geneva.    The beginning of the conference is still uncertain due to  the  absence of the Moslem delegation, all the more so since the head  of the Moslem mission in Geneva Mustafa Bjedic announced two  hours before the talks were due to begin that the "Moslems would  boycott the gathering because Serbs have failed to withdraw from  the Gorazde area (Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia) as  requested". Conference circles do not consider this to be a  final decision yet by there is reason to fear that Silajdzic and  his delegation will really not arrive to examine Akashi's  ceasefire plan.    If a ceasefire accord is reached the Serb delegation is  ready  to immediately start talks on territorial delimitation.    Well-informed circles at the conference report about the  possibility of the meeting on territorial delimitation,  scheduled for June 6 and 7 in Talloires (France), being  transferred to Geneva if the warring sides previously reach a  ceasefire agreement.</p>

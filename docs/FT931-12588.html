			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-takers busy in the Footsie list THE LONDON stock market tried yesterday to extend the gains prompted by Tuesday's base rate cut, but was driven off course by the cool response to the Pounds 2.5bn auction in government bonds, where several leading houses had suffered substantial losses in the previous session. Profit-takers held the upper hand by the close. An early gain of 18.2, reflecting suggestions that a further reduction in base rates might be incorporated in the March Budget, took the FT-SE 100 Index to within eight points of its all-time high. Then weakness in sterling cast a cloud over interest rate optimism. Share prices began to sag and the market was below overnight levels throughout the second half of the session. The final reading put the FT-SE 100 at 2,832.5, down 3.2, with rights issue rumours overshadowing sentiment. Second-line stocks took up some of the slack as investors sought out shares overlooked in the market's strong advance following the reduction of base rates to 6 per cent. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, in direct contrast to the FT-SE 100, rose steadily to close 12.9 higher at 2,964.5. Non-Footsie stocks also increased their contribution to the day's business, providing around 56 per cent of the session's Seaq volume total of 753.4m shares. The full impact of Tuesday's unexpected cut in base rates was confirmed by a total of Pounds 1.72bn in retail business in equities on that day's Seaq volume figure of 861.7m shares. Leading securities houses are believed to have suffered losses in equities, having trimmed positions sharply on Monday in order to open short positions in government bonds ahead of yesterday's auction. These trading losses at marketmaking firms helped to subdue the equity market yesterday. Estimates of trad-ing losses in the gilt-edged market range from Pounds 15m towards Pounds 25m. However, investors were still prepared to buy stocks likely to benefit from the base rate cut. Once again, the building materials, construction and contracting sectors found buyers. Banks were weakened by profit-taking, however, and rights issue rumours fell heavily across the insurance sector. Store and retail shares also gave ground as the continued uncertainty over Christmas sales was fuelled by disappointment with the trading results from WH Smith. More convincing confirmation of a recovery in UK retail sales is still regarded as a necessary basis for a second leg of the bull run in the equity market which began when sterling left the European exchange rate mechanism in September. Rights issue rumours strengthened towards the close of trading, when several old market targets were hoisted above the parapet again. While traders refused to be stampeded yesterday, there was general agreement that rights issues are more likely to be brought forward now that the predicted base rate cut is out in the open. Equity strategists are now increasingly bullish. Mr Nicholas Knight, the arch bull at Nomura Research Institute Europe, referred to 'Golden Tuesday', stressing that the significance of the latest one point cut in base rates cannot be overstated. Unlike some analysts, Mr Knight refuses to be alarmed by the ratings of 17 times historic earnings now ruling in the stock market.</p>

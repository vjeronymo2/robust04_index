			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno from Miraflores Palace; from the </F> "Union Radio News" newscast]    [Text] As we have reported, everything seems to indicate  that President Rafael Caldera was prompted to replace Venezuelan  Investment Fund [FIV] Minister Abdon Vivas Teran for failing to  sell Aeropostal through the bidding process.    Fernando Egana, deputy minister of the Secretariat of the  Presidency, has admitted that the chief of state has made this  decision, because he wants to accelerate the process of  privatization. He has added the former minister has established  the bases for this policy and the government will develop it:    [Begin recording] [Egana] He has established solid and  important bases, and the government will continue his efforts on  such bases.    [Unidentified reporter] Is there anything concrete in this  regard?    [Egana] A plan of privatization is already under way.    [Reporter] What is in store for Vivas?    [Egana] The president of the Republic will decide.    [Reporter] It was said the first attempt at privatization  has  failed. Will changes be made? Will a new element be introduced  to make it more effective?    [Egana] Using the bases already established, the government  will try to make greater efforts to attract foreign investments  that are needed at this time. [end recording]    When asked whether the MAS [Movement Toward Socialism] will  have a greater role in the government in view of the changes,  Egana has said the country has achieved greater participation  during the administration of President Caldera.</p>

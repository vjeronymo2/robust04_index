Our correspondent Ahmad 'Ubaydat reports on  this meeting:    [Begin recording] ['Ubaydat] The French Government is  committed to supporting the peace process and helping the  Palestinians in all domains in order to successfully establish  their self-rule. This was stated by French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe during his meeting with some Palestinian figures at  the Palestinian delegation's headquarters today. Juppe said:  Today's meeting was cordial and positive. As you know, the  French Government has for long been calling for and supporting  the idea of direct dialogue between Israel and the PLO. This  has actually been achieved following the signing of the  principles agreement and the mutual recognition.

He  said:    [Al-Husayni] In fact, the meeting was very positive. They  talked about their clear political position on the peace process  as a whole and on the issue of Jerusalem. They also expressed  their readiness to develop the aid extended to us, whether it is  financial aid or training assistance.    ['Ubaydat] The French foreign minister left for the Gaza  Strip to acquaint himself with the situation there. He will  then return to Jerusalem. [end recording]</p>

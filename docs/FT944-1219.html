			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / International Company News: TSB sells Irish bank's loan book for IPounds 116m TSB Group, the UK's sixth largest bank, has closed its Irish operations with the sale of the loan book of its Irish Business Bank subsidiary to Anglo Irish Bank for IPounds 116m (Pounds 114.6m). Anglo Irish said the sum represented the net book value; the gross value was IPounds 140m, the difference being the provision for bad and doubtful debts. Mr Peter Killen, Anglo Irish's executive director responsible for risk assets, said the new loan book, comprising about 400 accounts in the medium-sized corporate and professional market, reflected the spread of the existing specialised areas of business and would take its risk assets above IPounds 1bn. Three years ago, Anglo Irish entered talks about buying Hill Samuel (Ireland), as Irish Business Bank was formerly known. Negotiations broke down the following April after completion of the due diligence process left the two sides unable to agree on a price. The deal announced yesterday, which is subject to regulatory approval, would be fully funded from Anglo Irish's own resources, Mr Killen said. The TSB subsidiary had virtually stopped new lending during the last couple of years and the emphasis had been on structuring the operation in a form that would attract buyers. A total of 37 jobs will be lost. The disposal marks the end of a process of withdrawal by TSB from Ireland over the last few years as the group moves to concentrate on its UK business. In April this year it sold the Hill Samuel Fagan Investment Management business to Allied Irish Banks for an undisclosed amount. In 1992, UDT Bank, part of Hill Samuel Ireland, was sold to Woodchester Investments, the Dublin-based leasing and financial services group, for IPounds 23.4m cash.</p>

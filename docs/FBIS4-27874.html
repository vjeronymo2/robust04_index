			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 6 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  will invite leaders of the three branches of government, the  ruling Democratic Liberal Party and the opposition Democratic  Party to a luncheon at Chongwadae [presidential offices]  Wednesday to brief them on the results of his visit to Russia  and discuss suprapartisan action on North Korea's nuclear  program.    Kim will explain the latest developments concerning the  North's nuclear ambitions and urge the attendees to make  suprapartisan efforts to cope with any contingencies that  international sanctions against Pyongyang might entail, informed  sources in the ruling camp said Monday.    Opposition Democratic Party Chairman Yi Ki-taek, in the  meantime, is expected to stress the need to solve the problem  peacefully on the basis of his party's position that war should  not break out under any circumstances.    The opposition leader is also likely to urge that sanctions,  if deemed inevitable, should not be initiated by only three  countries -- South Korea, the United States and Japan -- but by  the United Nations as a whole.</p>

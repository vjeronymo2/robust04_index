			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: New rubber pact rejected by EC THE EUROPEAN Community has said that it is unwilling to renegotiate a new International Natural Rubber Agreement (Inra) in what appears to be a head on clash between rubber producer and consumer countries, . The present Inra is the second since pricing mechanisms for the natural rubber trade were set by producer and consumer countries in the late 1970s. It expires at the end of this year. Producers, upset by continued low prices, want consumer countries to negotiate a new pact. They set the end of March as a deadline for consuming countries to declare their willingness to negotiate a new agreement. A statement yesterday from the European Commission in Brussels said that the EC saw no alternative but to vote against renegotiation of Inra. It accused the rubber producing countries of failing to abide by price review provisions laid down in the existing pact. It is not known what decisions on Inra have been taken by other big consumer countries, in particular the US and Japan. In the past the US has been unwilling to agree to any renegotiation of Inra. Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia account for nearly 80 per cent of world natural rubber production. They - along with Sri Lanka and the Ivory Coast - are the producers involved in the Inra pact. Earlier this year the Inra producers warned that if the consumers did not agree to renegotiate the organisation would collapse. Producers would then be forced to bring in their own pricing mechanisms.</p>

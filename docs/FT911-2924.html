			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / International Company News: Data General extends 'open systems' products DATA GENERAL, buoyed by its first quarterly profit in five years, now aims to re-establish itself as a leader in the field of mid-range computers, writes Louise Kehoe. With the introduction of a new range of high performance computers yesterday, the company claimed that it is on the way to achieving long-term profitability. Data General's comeback strategy is to focus on a new range of 'open systems' products, based on industry standards, while also boosting sales of its established proprietary products. The new systems, launched at international events, extend the performance of Data General's open systems product line into the realms of the mainframe computer. The new Aviion systems are based on Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) microprocessors supplied by Motorola and will process 117m instructions per second, supporting up to 1,275 users on a network, the company said. Prices start at Dollars 96,000. Industry analysts predicted that the new products will significantly boost Data General's Open Systems sales, which stood at about Dollars 100m last year when the company had total revenues of Dollars 1.22bn. Data General earned Dollars 12.4m in its last fiscal quarter, on revenue of Dollars 311.7m. For it fiscal 1990, the company lost Dollars 139.8m on revenue of Dollars 1.22bn. Earlier this week, Data General announced the sale of its Japanese unit Nippon Data General, to Omron of Kyoto, Japan,for about Dollars 46m. The company expects to report a gain from the sale of Dollars 13m.</p>

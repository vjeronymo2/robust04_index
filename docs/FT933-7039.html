			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / International Company News: Dogfight in Canada's skies nears climax - What has become a bitter and messy corporate battle A BARRAGE of noisy volleys over the past fortnight suggests that the drawn-out fight for survival between Canada's two main airlines is nearing a climax. Air Canada and Canadian Airlines International are firing every weapon at their disposal as each seeks supremacy in a battle which has become increasingly frantic, but remains as confused and unpredictable as when it began almost two years ago. The only certainty is that both airlines, with combined debts of CDollars 4.2bn (USDollars 3.3bn), are bleeding profusely. Foreign carriers complain that fare-cutting by the two combatants is severely undermining the profitability of their Canadian routes. 'Whatever one does, the other will do in spades,' says the representative of one European airline in Toronto. Mr Ted Larkin, analyst at Bunting Warburg in Toronto, predicts that whatever the outcome, the survivor (or survivors) will require a heavy injection of equity. The latest salvoes have come from Air Canada, which is desperately trying to thwart a planned alliance between Canadian and AMR Corporation of Dallas, parent company of American Airlines. AMR would secure Canadian's future by infusing CDollars 246m of new capital in exchange for a 33 per cent equity stake. But the US carrier has put a gun to Canadian's head by setting an end-1993 deadline for the deal to be finalised. As an alternative to the American deal, Air Canada last week offered to pay CDollars 200m for Canadian's offshore routes to Asia, Europe and South America. It would also take over leases on the aircraft which currently fly those routes, making the total deal worth about CDollars 1bn. Canadian would be left as a domestic carrier. Air Canada's offer, like other moves it has made, is shrewdly timed. As a former quasi-state-owned corporation which was privatised in 1989, the Montreal-based airline 'knows how to pull the levers of politics', one Toronto analyst says. The proposal comes on the eve of crucial votes on August 27 by shareholders and creditors of PWA, Canadian's parent company, on a financial restructuring. Air Canada's offer to take over some of the jewels of Canadian's fleet means that senior creditors who hold the leases on these aircraft can look forward to cash payments, rather than the near-worthless common shares offered to them under PWA's restructuring plan. Air Canada has also sought to defuse criticism that any solution other than the deal with American would result in huge job losses at Canadian, especially on its home turf in western Canada. Air Canada has offered, for instance, to set up a wide-body jet maintenance base in Vancouver and to employ all Canadian's international crews. Meanwhile, the Montreal-based carrier has shored up public support on its own doorstep by signing a tentative letter of intent last week to buy up to 48 Canadair Regional Jets from Bombardier, the transportation group whose main assembly plant is also in Montreal. Canadian has so far rejected Air Canada's overtures outright. Mr Rhys Eyton, Canadian's chairman, called the bid for its routes part of 'a diabolical plot' to kill his airline. If nothing else, having to shrink Canadian from an international airline flying to five continents to an insignificant domestic carrier would be a severe humiliation. Canadian has its roots in Pacific Western Airlines, which was a profitable regional carrier before it over-stretched by swallowing Canadian Pacific Airlines and Wardair in the late 1980s. Mr Larkin says, however, that Air Canada's latest proposal plus American's year-end deadline have put Canadian against the wall. 'The options have become more limited,' he says. 'Time is running out.' Canadian has pleaded for the government to come to the rescue, though it has yet to specify in what way. It argues that if the deal with American collapses, thousands of jobs will be lost and the national interest damaged by leaving Air Canada as an unfettered monopoly. Loan guarantees from the federal and several provincial governments have helped keep Canadian flying for the past year. But with a general election looming, politicians are now more reluctant to become involved as they find themselves torn between two high-profile companies, each with its own powerful regional constituency. The dilemma for the government is epitomised by the fact that Ms Kim Campbell, the prime minister, comes from Vancouver, while her transport minister, Mr Jean Corbeil, is a Quebecer. Canadian's best (and perhaps last) hope of clinching the deal with American lies with the quasi-judicial Competition Tribunal in Ottawa. The tribunal will convene on September 8 to consider the latest of many tortuous attempts by Canadian to extricate itself from the Gemini computerised reservations system, which it owns in partnership with Air Canada and a unit of United Airlines. A condition of Canadian's entire deal with American is that Canadian sever its ties with Gemini, and take its business to AMR's Sabre system. AMR wants to use Canadian as a guinea pig and a showpiece for its business of providing management services to airlines, other transport companies and hotels. Canadian contends that the dissolution of Gemini would preserve competition in the airline industry. But Air Canada is fighting its rival's effort to withdraw from Gemini, arguing that Canadian is legally bound to remain in Gemini until 1999, and that its withdrawal would undermine the network's viability. The competition tribunal, which has considered the Gemini issue once before, is expected to come to a quick decision. What that decision will be is largely a matter of conjecture. One way or the other, however, it will provide a pointer to the outcome of what has become one of Canada's most messy corporate battles.</p>

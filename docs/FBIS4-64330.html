			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at the Council on </F> Foreign Relations in Washington on 21 April]    [Text] On 9 January President Clinton stressed in Brussels  the unique significance of the European-U.S. partnership in  fate. Hardly any country is so much aware of that as Germany.  In the U.S. headquarters in Berlin, John F. Kennedy's phrase  "The world must know that we are willing to fight for Berlin"  can be read in bronze letters.    Tomorrow U.S. soldiers and their families will be the guests  of families in Berlin and will say good-bye. They came as  occupiers, became protectors, and leave as friends -- as was  stated by Major General Walter Yates, who will be the last U.S.  soldier to leave Berlin on 15 October.    Polls show: For more than 80 percent of Germans the United  States is the most important partner. It is said that States  only have interests and no friends. However, the Marshall Plan,  the Berlin blockade, and, most recently, reunification showed us  to our pleasure that peoples do have friends. Our American  friends must know: This will never be forgotten.    As a result of the end of the East-West conflict, a  worldwide  threat to security has been abolished. Economic aspects are now  becoming more important all over the world -- also in the  European-U.S. relationship. However, I am profoundly convinced  -- and this, Ladies and Gentlemen, is my most important message  to you this evening -- that Germans and Americans will be able  to continue the great chapter of success of the postwar period  also in the new time. For quite a simple reason: We need each  other in the future just as we did in the past!    We have not only common interests but our common interests  and ties far exceed our differences. Germany and the United  States form the core of NATO. Never before have U.S. Armed  Forces been so closely interlaced. We are alternating as world  champions in export, and we are leading in the support for  Central and East Europe and the CIS states. The dollar and  German mark are the main reserve currencies in the world, and we  are both leading in the protection of the natural bases of life.  Since 1945 more Americans have lived and worked in Germany than  anywhere else in the world. The United States is the biggest  foreign investor in Germany and, at the same time, number one in  German foreign investments.    For 40 years we successfully were against communism. Today  the important thing is what we stand for together. This is more  difficult, but also more profitable: Up to now we had to invest  in armament, now we can finally turn to the tasks of peace.  Just as we, together with France, are the engine of European  integration in the European Union [EU], we, together with the  United States, want to be the engine for enforcing  European-Atlantic goals. Being the common driving force for  efficient multilateralism -- this is our idea. Making sure  together that the new multilateral order, rudiments of which  already exist, works properly -- this is our goal.    The ties between us, which have proved their worth over 40  years, are not weakened by European unification -- on the  contrary, they get an additional dimension: We also understand  ourselves as an important supporter of European-U.S. dialogue  and as a guarantor of an Atlantic Europe which is open to the  world, supports free trade, and in which our American friends  will always remain our most important partner. This European  dimension of our relations will become increasingly important in  the future, given the new importance of economic and trade  issues. I am convinced that President Clinton's planned visit  in July will make this new dimension of our ties very clear.    After reunification and the fall of the Iron Curtain our  interests remain basically unchanged:    First: We owe security and prosperity to being anchored in  the Western community of peoples through the EU and the Alliance.    Second: European and Transatlantic anchoring cannot be  played off against each other; they are inseparable and  interdependent.    Third: The Alliance is the most important and indispensable  link across the Atlantic. It is a forum for dialogue, an anchor  of security, a shield for European unification, and a manager of  regional conflicts all in one. Without the Alliance there would  not be any balance in Europe; in particular, however, there  would not be any equal partnership with Russia, which we are  striving for together. The wooing of the old lady NATO could  not be more stormy than it is at the moment. In Germany, NATO  is more popular than ever in the past 15 years. It may sound  paradoxical in view of the end of the East-West conflict, but if  NATO did not exist, one would have to invent it again!    Ladies and Gentlemen, today we are confronted with issues  that hardly anyone thought about 10 years ago: How can the  citizens in the industrial states get appropriately paid jobs,  if hundreds of millions of people in East Europe or in the Third  World compete with them for a fraction of the wages paid in our  countries? How can we establish a stable and liberal order all  over Europe after the end of communism? How can we prevent the  struggle for technological superiority from turning the three  large industrial regions into opponents?    During the hour that I am talking to you here, another  10,000  people will be born. In the course of 800 years -- from the  birth of Christ to the time of Charlemagne -- mankind grew by 50  million. Today it is growing by this number within eight months.  Can we brake this development in time, before it will become  impossible to live a decent life in this world?    We need look no longer for a new transatlantic agenda for  the  turn of the millennium. These challenges are the agenda. If we  want to save something of the prosperity and the security of our  days for our children and grandchildren in the next millennium,  then this agenda must lead to common transatlantic solutions.  Japan and the Pacific area must be included. Never has  political leadership been more urgent than during this time of  revolutionary changes. And it can come only from one country --  the United States. The superpower United States must keep its  leading role!    I see four main tasks for a strategic transatlantic  partnership:    First: All three large industrial regions must put their  houses in order. This is the precondition for successful  cooperation toward the outside. The G-7 conference in Detroit  was a signal: The employment crisis cannot be solved by working  against each other. Detroit may have shown a vision for the  future: European vocational training coupled with U.S.  mobility. We are learning from each other.    The great trump card of your country is the readiness for  change, the courage to follow new paths. In the United States  the multimedia world of the 21st century is currently  developing. West Europe must get away from the mentality of the  status quo and of complete insurance. However, the economy in  our countries is also experiencing an upswing again. The  extraordinary effort of internal unification is showing success.  In the new laender we expect a growth of 8 percent this year.  We want to participate in heading the necessary intellectual  and economic renewal of Europe.    Second: Whether it will be possible to save the world from a  relapse into the power struggles of the past will be decided in  Europe. With the same energy that the United States and West  Europe used to preserve West Europe's freedom in the postwar  period, they now must help to make democracy and market economy  irreversible all over Europe. The opening up of the EU and NATO  toward the East is thus becoming the decisive stabilizing  element. This means setting the course in Europe for the next  years.    The accession of Norway and the so far neutral countries  Austria, Finland, and Sweden to the EU, for which I have worked  with all my strength, will be another milestone in overcoming  the European division. However, the postwar Europe will be  completely a part of history only when Hungary, Poland, the  Czech Republic, and others also sit at the table in Brussels.  European and German interests are parallel in this respect. We  are the advocate for the return of these states to Europe.  However, this does not mean that we want to get away from the  West. We want to have "West" also at our eastern border, that  is the point! As little as Europe was viable with the Iron  Curtain, as little can it flourish in the long run with a  dividing trench which divides the European democracies into a  two-class system.    After centuries of fratricidal wars and two world wars, the  reconciliation of minds and the unification of forces in Europe  remains a historical task. And if there is a foreign policy  mission for the united Germany, then it is the mission to  support this task, to unify Europe, and to save it from a  relapse into the past. The path toward this is the one that we  are following: common institutions, a big single market, equal  laws, and regional solidarity. Everything in Europe is oriented  toward this model of the EU -- like metal parts toward a magnet.  It will determine Europe's course in the future. Therefore, my  message to our American friends: Even if the EU is not yet what  we would like it to be -- do not underestimate this Europe!    The discussion about our participation in the D-Day  celebrations in Normandy shows that 50 years are a short time in  the memories of the peoples. However, we know how much new,  real ties have developed despite the continuing memory of all  the terrible things of the past. De Gaulle rightly called the  close German-French relationship the actual miracle of the  postwar period. We ourselves do not want to ignore our past.  We are building on it, and we see our view confirmed that  memories do not block the view into a better common future.    The credo of your administration: "Foreign policy is  domestic policy is foreign policy" applies to us Germans in a  particular way: A humane, liberal face of our country, our  credibility as democrats are the basic precondition for our  position in the international community. I do not want to play  down in any way the ugly and incomprehensible things that have  happened in the recent past in Germany to foreigners or Jewish  facilities. I just ask you to believe me when I say: This is  done by deluded individuals. This is not Germany! We Germans  are ashamed of that, we abhor it! We have learned from our  history.    Ladies and Gentlemen, Jim Hoagland once called the  traditional U.S. attitude toward European integration "creative  ambivalence." I would call the position of the current  administration a position of "creative involvement." With its  offer of the Partnership for Peace the United States has  convincingly documented its power of political leadership and  its continuing will to participate in shaping the European fate.    Now there is a concept for solving the complicated security  needs in the postcommunist Europe, a concept that has met with  widespread approval. It avoids the dead end of the either  membership or exclusion. It facilitates a flexible approach to  NATO without tearing up any new trenches.    I hope that Russia, too, will join in soon. To all those who  are calling for a "take and run policy" by referring to  Zhirinovskiy, that is, quickly lowering a new Iron Curtain a few  hundred kilometers east of the old one, I can only say: Anyone  who now leaves the reformers in Moscow in the lurch burdens  himself with great responsibility. Russia is undergoing a  tensile test.    No one could seriously have expected that this enormous  process of transformation from a dictatorship to democracy would  take place without any problems. We must not show less  understanding and patience toward the new democratic forces in  Moscow now than we showed to the communist apparatchiks in the  past. As long as Russia says "yes" to partnership with Europe  and the United States, we want to say "yes" to partnership with  Russia.    A new European order presupposes equal rights and mutual  respect -- for big and small. We must help the reformers, who  are under great pressure at home, to keep their country on this  European course. Russia is a large and important country, which  cannot be bypassed by a new European peace order.    The actual question is not whether the West can influence  the internal development in Russia but whether it can afford not  to try. I think: No, it cannot, and with this opinion I find  myself in the company of Warren Christopher.    Third: The EU and the United States must together become the  most important supporter of the new multilateral architecture  and its global responsibility. Germany wants to participate in  this fully, if necessary also with military means. However,  global co-responsibility must also mean global co-determination.  In this spirit we have registered our claim for a permanent  seat on the UN Security Council. I am grateful for U.S. support.    Regarding greater German co-responsibility in the United  Nations there is broad agreement between the Federal Government  and the opposition. However, this consensus does not cover the  role of the Bundeswehr. As a Liberal I certainly do not want a  militarization of our foreign policy. As a realist, however, I  also know that there are situations in which aggression and  violence can be ended only with violence in return.    Germany's foreign and security policy cannot ignore this  insight. As a result of the changed tasks of NATO and the  Western EU, this now involves our ability to function in the  alliance! We will not forget our past, but we will not hide  behind it, either. I expect the Federal Constitutional Court to  pave the way for that soon.    Strategic partnership across the Atlantic naturally requires  an interlocutor on the European side and a common European  foreign and security policy, which deserves this name.  Admittedly, there is still a lot to be done in this respect.  Germany does not see a common European policy as a restriction  but as the only chance for really getting something done on the  world stage.    Institutions depend on the interests and possibilities of  those of their member states that are most capable of action.  In Croatia and Bosnia not only the EU, but also NATO and the  United Nations had to realize that. Barbarism has returned  virtually at our doorstep. The tragedy of Gorazde forces the  admission: None of the international organizations has passed  its test so far. On the other hand, we must see clearly that  there are no simple and speedy recipes for success in this  conflict. However, resignation is also forbidden. The peace  process must be continued.    We must continue to look for a pragmatic path in the middle.  It lies in a credible mixture of political and military  options. In our view, President Clinton's new initiative offers  a good basis for that. Above all, the political efforts of the  EU, the United States, and Russia must be brought closer  together. In this conflict, too, it has been shown again: One  cannot do without the United States. Therefore, we have urged  the United States [to undertake] greater involvement right from  the start.    Fourth: Strategic partnership -- this is no less urgent in  the economy, the ecology, and the North-South field. The GATT  agreement has banished the danger of the development of trade  fortresses for the time being. But the trade imbalances in the  triangle of Europe, the United States, and Japan are an ongoing  source of serious tension. The EU and the United States agree  on the need for greater opening up of the Japanese market.    In the field of military security we have successfully taken  one lesson into account for the past 40 years: If one's partner  is well off, one is also well off. We still have to learn that  this also applies to the economy. We need some sort of code of  behavior for the geo-economic age. It must balance competition  with cooperation, and free trade with ecology and social  development.    Ladies and Gentlemen, "For better or worse, we have had to  learn that we all live in one world, in which we cannot isolate  ourselves. We have learned that peace and well-being are  inseparable and cannot be bought at the cost of the pace and  well-being of another people." This was stated by State  Secretary Byrnes in his great reconciliatory speech in Stuttgart  on 6 September 1946.    Today we once again make this experience in a world that has  become freer but not simpler. However, we have every reason to  rely on the opportunities provided by the new freedom and not to  let ourselves be discouraged by the risks. If Europeans and  Americans, Germany and the United States stand together, then  there is very little that they cannot master together. The  United States can rely on Germany! We know that we can rely on  the United States!</p>

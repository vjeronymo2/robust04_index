No consensus has been  reached yet concerning issues pertaining to the future national  police force. Lusaka today should see the mediators hold  separate meetings with the negotiating teams. Pedro Manuel, our  correspondent in the Zambian capital, reports:    [Begin Manuel recording] Good morning, dear listeners. Yet  another day opens without consensus on the future national  police issue, all because there continue to be differences in  the positions adopted by the two negotiating teams. Today, the  mediators and observers are expected to continue holding  separate meetings with the negotiating teams. Since 13 January,  the negotiators have been seeking an understanding that will  allow discussions to begin on specific principles and modalities  governing the future national police force. At their separate  meetings, the negotiating teams have been delivering to the  observers their written views on what they believe the aforesaid  specific principles should be. However, no gap has been bridged  yet, so UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye and the  peace process observers have decided to continue holding  separate meetings. [end recording]</p>

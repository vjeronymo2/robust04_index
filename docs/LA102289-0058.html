			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHOOSING SIDES ON BUILDING PLANS  </P> <P> The rhubarb over a proposed project at Santa Monica airport makes painfully  clear why homeowner groups have been so energetic (and accused of being  "fanatic" and "overzealous") in their opposition to such intrusive projects and  so distrustful of the actions of government.  </P> <P> The scene is repeated almost laughably often: 1) The developer proposes a  project of enormous size; 2) the developer emphasizes that the project will  have "no impact on the community!"; 3) The City Council (in this case, Santa  Monica, but Los Angeles is no less guilty of this behavior) sidles up to the  homeowners with professions of support, yells and screams at the size of the  project, and proceeds to approve a "reduced" project, accepting the developer's  contention that the project will have "no impact."  </P> <P> You don't have to be a genius to imagine that the developer proposed a much  bigger project than he really needed, and that even the "reduced" project will  have lots of "impact."  </P> <P> Those of us active in homeowners' causes know that the system is based upon  much more than rationality, and that our leaders usually appear willing to risk  future community integrity for present promises of tax base and campaign  support. The people who live here seem to have a much better sense of what will  work and what won't in the near and far future. Until government and developers  show that they truly have community integrity at heart, rather than just their  own pocketbooks, homeowner associations will continue their "fanatic,  overzealous" hue and cry.  </P> <P> ALLAN RABINOWITZ  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

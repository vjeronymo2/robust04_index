			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CABLE SHOPPING CHANNELS MUST STATE BENEFITS  </P> <P> A federal appeals court today upheld rules that require would-be radio or TV  licensees such as home shopping channels to make only the briefest assertions  that their programming will serve the public interest.  </P> <P> The ruling affirmed an important part of the overall deregulation of  broadcasting that began in the early 1980s under the Ronald Reagan  Administration.  </P> <P> The case arose when challengers tried to prevent the Federal Communications  Commission from awarding licenses in Cleveland and Baltimore to subsidiaries of  the Home Shopping Network, whose round-the-clock sell-a-thon stations hawk  merchandise to television viewers through telephone orders.  </P> <P> HSN stations typically devote a small portion of their days to public affairs  or news shows in order to meet FCC requirements that stations provide  "non-entertainment programming responsive to issues of concern in the community  to be served."  </P> <P> Due to revisions the FCC made beginning in 1981, license applicants currently  must make only a "brief narrative description" of proposed programming that  indicates they understand and intend to comply with their public service  obligations -- and not make specific promises of what their programming will  be.  </P></p>

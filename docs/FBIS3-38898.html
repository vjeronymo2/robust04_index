Cuevas made this comment after meeting with Gonzalez for  just over an hour and a quarter, together with Manuel Otero,  chairman of the Spanish Confederation of Small and Medium-Sized  Enterprises.    The employers' organization's top leader said that he is  prepared to meet with the trade unions at any time and with any  agenda, but he emphasized that the labor reform process is now  in a different sphere from that of the social interlocutors. In  Cuevas' opinion, the essential thing is that the new legislation  is in the parliamentary groups' hands, and the system's channels  must be respected. He therefore specified that the prime  minister has opted for the only stance that he could adopt with  respect to the trade unions.    In short, Cuevas sought to clarify his previous statements,  which were interpreted as a refusal to negotiate. In fact, it  is a matter of emphasis. The employers' organization chairman  said the same thing yesterday as on previous days, but changing  the stresses and emphases. Cuevas did not wish the  interpretation to be made that the CEOE is being inflexible with  the trade unions. Thus he maintained that he is prepared to  talk with them, but proceeding from one premise: Everybody must  accept his responsibilities, and the social agents must not  supplant parliament.    "The responsibilities of the government and parliament and  those of the social agents must be delineated. This must be  scrupulously respected throughout this process. However, this  does not limit at all the possibility of the parliamentary  groups being able to receive information and proposals from  everybody regarding these very important bills." Cuevas also  emphasized that, in the employers' organization's opinion, the  useful thing would be for the trade unions to come and negotiate  now the application of the labor reform to the various sectors.  The employers' organization views this as the real key to the  reform, which can be more or less important, depending on its  specific application.    In short, the CEOE believes that the appropriate thing is to  turn over the page and get down to business -- namely, the  negotiation of the collective agreements. "Let there be no  confusion," Cuevas said emphatically at one point, "because  there is a process here which cannot be stopped. If it stopped,  that would damage everybody's credibility, but let it also be  clear that the most important thing about the reform is not its  text, or the very slight amendments which have been made  concerning dismissal. Neither. The most important and  significant thing is the discussion which will be held on the  agreements on the organization of work in enterprises."</p>

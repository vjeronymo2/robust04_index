			<p>BFN     [Text] Tashkent, June 6 (YONHAP) -- South Korean President  Kim Yong-sam said on Monday that North Korea's nuclear  development is a matter of life and death, which threatens world  peace as well as the 70 million Korean people. He told  journalists before he leaves Uzbekistan on Monday that if North  Korea dares to push for imprudent adventure, then it will lead  to nothing but self-destruction of North Korea.    Kim said, "We cannot allow even half a nuclear weapon in  North Korea. I will deter North Korea without fail from having  a nuclear weapon. We are watching the move of North Korea 24  hours a day, and the military power of South Korea, U.S. forces  in Korea and United Nations force can repress war on the Korean  peninsula."    But he added that there are no strange military moves now in  North Korea. "I will have the national security conference  according to Constitution on Wednesday at Chongwadae. I will  also have a dialogue with U.S. President Bill Clinton over the  telephone to discuss ways to cope with the North Korean nuclear  problem as soon as I return home," he said.</p>

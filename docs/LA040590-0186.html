			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> ADULT BUSINESSES MORATORIUM GAINS  </P> <P> The City Council has extended a ban on new dance halls, nightclubs and topless  bars, and has scheduled a public hearing that could lead to an extension of a  separate freeze on adult businesses.  </P> <P> The council this week voted unanimously to extend the dance hall ban for up to  10 months and 15 days to give the city more time to prepare an ordinance  regulating such activities.  </P> <P> "There are noise problems and there has been violence connected with some of  these operations," said City Atty. Stuart Scudder. "(City) staff needs more  time to study relevant court decisions and make the necessary revisions to the  ordinance."  </P> <P> The City Council also voted unanimously to schedule a public hearing on April  16 to consider extending a moratorium on new or expanded adult businesses such  as adult bookstores, billiard parlors and X-rated video arcades. The moratorium  applies to new and expanded adult businesses along Garden Grove Boulevard  between Beach Boulevard and Magnolia Street. JAMES TORTOLANO  </P></p>

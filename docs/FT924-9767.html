			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / The Maastricht Vote: The Labour Amendment 'That this House notes that the European Communities (Amendment) Bill received a majority of 244 at its second reading and was committed to a committee of the whole House, recalls the conditions relating to the Danish position and to subsidiarity laid down by the Prime Minister in the debate in this House on 24th September; and believes that these conditions cannot be satisfied until the Edinburgh European Council at the earliest and that therefore further consideration of the Bill should wait the outcome of that meeting.'</p>

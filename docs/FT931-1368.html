			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / N Korea ends 'war footing' NORTH KOREA said yesterday that it was ending its state of 'semi-war' that was declared two weeks ago in response to the annual US-South Korean military exercise, writes John Burton in Seoul. The Team Spirit manoeuvres, which Pyongyang claimed were a 'rehearsal for nuclear war', were completed last Thursday, and US troops who participated in the exercise are leaving South Korea. The proclamation of a 'semi-war' footing was a prelude to Pyongyang's subsequent withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. North Korea said it was pulling out of the treaty due to the Team Spirit exercise and a demand by the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect two facilities believed to be connected with the country's nuclear weapons programme. Officials in Seoul said Pyongyang put the country on a 'semi-war' footing to build support for North Korea's next leader, Mr Kim Jong-il, who is gradually assuming power from his father, Mr Kim Il-sung. Mr Kim Jong-il is believed to face army opposition and the semi-war status was meant to assert his authority over the military establishment.</p>

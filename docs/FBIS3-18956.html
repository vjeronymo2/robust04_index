			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, March 9 (AFP) -- France should continue  easing interest rates to underpin a projected modest recovery  this year and a brisker upswing in 1995, and would do well in  trying to reduce Germany's influence on its monetary policy, the  OECD suggested Wednesday [9 March].    In a survey of the French economy, the Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said output growth  should now resume after last year's recession which cut GDP by  an estimated 0.8 percent and boosted France's jobless rate to a  record 12 percent.    It projected growth at a modest pace of 1.1 percent this  year, with domestic demand remaining weak and price and wage  inflation on a steady downward path as a result of both high  unused capacity and high unemployment.    Stronger domestic demand in 1995, including a recovery in  business investment, would help raise the rate to about 2.5  percent, the OECD said.    Even so, it stressed, growth would be too slow to check a  still-worsening jobless rate, likely to peak at 12.5 percent by  year-end, for an annual average of 12.4 percent both in 1994 and  1995 against 11.6 percent in 1993.    The OECD also warned that recovery in France "hinges on a  turnaround of activity in the rest of Europe."    "There is a risk that it will be delayed again or be weaker  than projected," it said.    The OECD's projections assumed that French monetary  authorities would stick to the "cautious" stance they adopted  after the widening last August of the bands of fluctuation in  the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM).    On this basis, the OECD said, French short-term interest  rates were expected to decline further "in line with German  rates" to about 4 percent by end-1995.    However, it said, if German rates fell less than projected  --  because of a worsening German inflation outlook or similar  hitches -- "French authorities would have to consider how to  continue their policy of gradual interest rate reductions while  maintaining their stable currency strategy" -- aimed at keeping  a steady franc-German mark relationship in the ERM.    "As no room for fiscal manoeuvre is left, this would be the  only way to support demand," the report stressed.    Lower short-term rates and positive wealth effects could  stimulate activity, and with inflation under control and the  exchange rate broadly in line with fundamentals, there would be  "little risk of adverse impacts" on long-term rates, it pointed  out.    Making their point clearer, OECD economists said a "crucial"  issue for French monetary policy in the new ERM environment was  "whether and how a greater degree of monetary autonomy can be  achieved" without upsetting ERM currency stability.    They suggested a new set of "clear objectives and rules" for  monetary policy, tying short-term interest rates not only to  exchange rates but also to such indicators as money supply, a  range of inflation data, the yield curve and the level of  long-term interest rates.    If a "credible" framework was achieved along these lines,  long-term rates could "durably decline below German levels,"  they said.    The OECD also warned that in the absence of a "sufficiently  strong European-wide recovery," France would have to further  rebalance its policy mix "in order to make rapid progress" in  cutting the towering budget deficit which reached 5.8 percent of  GDP last year.    While most of the deficit widening since 1991 was cyclical,  the structural component had also worsened, and the overall  deficit was now "clearly unsustainable" because it entailed a  rapid rise in the debt-to-GDP ratio.    The report welcomed government moves to tighten fiscal  policy  this year, its longer-term programme aimed at cutting the  state's deficit to 2.5 percent of GDP by 1997, and last year's  structural measures to put the social security system on a sound  financial footing.    But it said action towards these targets was needed "without  delay," and reform of the social protection system must be  completed even at the cost of "short-term hardship" for some  groups.    With deficit-reduction risking to dampen recovery, the OECD  said, continued cuts in interest rates were all the more  warranted.</p>

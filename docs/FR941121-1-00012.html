			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Advocates had criticized the minimum ``above-horizontal'' illumination requirements established by the agency for 1994 and newer model vehicle headlamps as providing poorer performance than that of sealed beam headlamps. It opposed lens replacement on the basis of a potential for a further reduction in ``above-horizontal'' illumination which it believed would result from deviations in lens alignment during replacement. The Bosch data should allay Advocates' concern, as should a comment by Osram Sylvania that headlamp photometry is not sensitive to the slight misalignments possible during lens replacement. Although Osram Sylvania had other criticisms of replaceable lenses, it reported that common design practices for replaceable bulb headlamps limit the sensitivity of photometric performance to lens misalignment and that replacement lenses need not be identical to original lenses to maintain equivalent photometric performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In summary, comments and data submitted to the docket are persuasive that photometric performance of new lamps is not sensitive to typical production variations of replacement lenses. For the reasons expressed above, it appears that headlamps with on-vehicle aiming and replaceable lenses are equivalent in photometric performance to headlamps with on-vehicle aiming and bonded lenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Durability Performance of Headlamps Before and After Relensing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For new headlamps, Standard No. 108's tests for dust penetration, corrosion, humidity, vibration, and water sealing should assure that headlamps with replaceable lenses will have a lens-to-reflector sealing that is equivalent to the protection provided by headlamps with bonded lens/reflector assemblies. However, if the reflector of a headlamp is affected by exposure during the period when the vehicle is operated with a broken lens or by improper cleaning attempts during relensing, there is a strong possibility that an owner may continue to use the unit after relensing without being aware of its degraded performance. Less than half of all states have periodic vehicle inspection, and those that do differ in their rigor. Thus, inspection programs cannot be expected to detect the decreased photometric performance of headlamps with degraded reflectors. The second potential problem is that the lens-seal integrity could be lost during relensing, and that an otherwise good reflector would be subject to moisture and dust for the remaining life of the vehicle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reflector degradation was not a concern before 1983 when replaceable bulb headlamps were allowed. In a sealed beam lamp, a crack in the lens large enough to admit moisture would cause the filament to fail, necessitating the replacement of the entire headlamp. However, replaceable bulb headlamps can continue to operate despite a broken lens, and the possibility of degraded reflectors was considered by the agency during the course of rulemaking that allowed them. The requirement for a bonded lens was motivated in part by NHTSA's desire to avoid creating a potential safety problem that had been impossible when Standard No. 108 allowed only sealed beam headlamps. It is a conservative requirement that results in the replacement of reflectors when the condition of the lens indicates possible long term exposure of the reflector to water and dirt. Even a small hole can cause the headlamp to fill with water due to condensation during the heating and cooling cycle of lamp use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A potential safety disadvantage of the bonded lens requirement is that the cost of replacing a headlamp rather than a lens may tend to delay or to discourage repair altogether. However, the desire to maintain the aesthetic quality of a newer vehicle and the obvious performance problem of a cracked lamp containing moisture should motivate many owners to make a replacement, even if costly. A more powerful motivation is provided by the vehicle inspection programs maintained by less than half of the states. Typically, the states inspect for aim and for damaged lenses, and in some instances inspect replaceable bulbs for maximum power to prevent the use of high powered ``off road'' aftermarket bulbs. But even strict states, such as Virginia, do not inspect for the low light output that would identify headlamps with degraded reflectors. Many commenters who favored the concept of replaceable lenses voiced concerns about the potential loss of performance of relensed units. AAMA suggested replaceable lenses for integral beam headlamps as well as for those with replaceable bulbs, but it commented that any rulemaking allowing replaceable lenses must assure that reflectors are designed to be more resistant to abrasion and solvents, with special durability and environmental qualification requirements added. American Honda was concerned about technical problems which may exist in ensuring that photometric performance is equal to the level of performance before the lens was damaged, and ensuring adequate sealing against dust and moisture after the lens alone is replaced. GE commented that the average consumer or automotive mechanic does not have the background and understanding to make the decisions necessary to determine if a headlamp is safely repairable. Osram Sylvania agreed with the Bosch petition that reflector surfaces can be cleaned during lens replacement, but it cautioned that the reflector can be damaged by improper cleaning and handling. It also advised that the touch of human hands can deposit skin oil on the reflector with the possible consequences of reflector fogging, reduced output and increased glare. It further commented that the lens replacement process could break the sealing coat, protecting the thin aluminum coating on the reflector from moisture, which could lead to a very rapid loss of reflecting area and photometric performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Volkswagen's comments also responded to questions about performance loss of relensed lamps. It suggested that only specially trained dealer service personnel should install lenses, presumably refusing to relens degraded lamps, and that state inspections should monitor the condition of reflectors. These steps may be feasible in Europe where reflector corrosion, at least in older designs, is a problem requiring universal inspection and where the manufacturers control the replacement lens supply. But they are not effective in the United States. Less than half the States have inspections, and those that do are not required to cover the condition of the reflector because it was never a concern during the long era in which sealed beams were the only type of headlamps allowed. Also, the U.S. aftermarket would not be limited to OEM lenses (conferring on dealers the power to refuse to repair degraded lamps) because non-OEM manufacturers would be free to manufacture components and sell them directly to vehicle owners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Roman Herzog, president of the </F> Constitutional Court and presidential candidate of the CDU/CSU,  in Wildhagen by Ulrich Wickert in Hamburg -- recorded]    [Text] [Wickert] Good evening, Mr. Herzog.    [Herzog] Good evening, Mr. Wickert.    [Wickert] Mr. Herzog, you have now been nominated as  presidential candidate by the Presidium of the Christian  Democratic Union [CDU]. Will you remain president of the  Constitutional Court during the election campaign?    [Herzog] There is no other way. Originally, I believed that  I might apply for a suspension from my office, but it is not  possible for legal reasons. I understand that, because the  legislator is interested in the efficiency of the court, and  because the basic right to recourse to the Constitutional Court  must be ensured. I could either relinquish the office totally,  which I am not willing to do and for which I see no reason, or I  could take the required steps if the question arises whether a  judge can participate in certain procedures or not, according to  Section 19 of the Law on the Constitutional Court. I will  choose the second option, and it is now up to the First Senate  of the Constitutional Court to make a decision as to what I am  supposed to do during my candidacy.    [Wickert] Mr. Herzog, you raised the question of the  majority situation at the closed session of the CDU Presidium  this morning. What was the answer?    [Herzog] What I wanted to do was to avoid this difficult  procedure, which is also a burden for my colleagues at the  Constitutional Court, if it is clear from the outset that my  candidacy for the presidential office does not stand any chance  of success. Thus, unanimous approval by the CDU and Christian  Social Union [CSU] had to be ensured. I raised this question,  and it was discussed. The result of a secret vote in the CDU  Executive Committee was completely satisfactory for me.    [Wickert] There was one opposing vote and one abstention.  These votes may have been cast by East German members. Mr.  Heitmann, your predecessor as presidential candidate, stated  that he would have liked a different candidate instead of Mr.  Herzog because he believes that a candidate from the east would  be better.    [Herzog] One can have different opinions on this issue. I  understand Mr. Heitmann's position very well. Yet, I ask you to  take into consideration that I have not competed against any  other candidate. I have no influence on this situation.    [Wickert] You stated that you do not want to be elected with  the votes of extremist parties. You were both referring to  right-wing parties and the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS].    [Herzog] Yes, exactly. The danger that the PDS might vote  for me is probably relatively small.    [Wickert] Acting President von Weizsaecker has moved his  office to Berlin. He gave the New Year reception for the  diplomatic corps in Berlin. Will you also move to Berlin?    [Herzog] Naturally I must point out that I am not the final  candidate of the CDU/CSU at this point, and I have not yet been  elected president. However, one thing is absolutely clear: I  began my career in Berlin, and it would be a great honor for me  to end it in Berlin.    [Wickert] Do you believe that direct election of the federal  president might be useful?    [Herzog] Mr. Wickert, I have a problem here. I once  expressed my view on this issue, and I was publicly rebuked for  it. I was accused of having overstepped my powers as president  of the Constitutional Court. Therefore, I will only say that  direct election makes sense if far-reaching powers are linked  with the president's office. One should discuss more than just  the election procedure.    [Wickert] You, yourself, said that the federal president  cannot do very much, that he can only talk a great deal. The  acting president occasionally used his speeches to sharply  criticize the parties. Will you continue this tradition?    [Herzog] I do not want to tell you now what topics I would  address as president. But I do not believe that giving speeches  is the only thing a president can do. Richard von Weizsaecker  and his predecessors have made that clear. However, there is no  doubt that delivering speeches is one of the president's main  tasks. Just think of the need to explain the state and our  constitution to the citizens time and again in a simple but  emphatic way.    [Wickert] Mr, Herzog, thank you very much.    [Herzog] You are welcome.</p>

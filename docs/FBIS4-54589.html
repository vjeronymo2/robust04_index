			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 29 April (MTI) -- Introduction of  preferential tariffs envisaged in the Central European Free  Trade Agreement (CEFTA) will be accelerated under a  supplementary protocol, signed in Budapest on Friday [29 April]  by Hungarian International Economic Relations Minister Bela  Kadar, Czech Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy, Polish  International Economic Cooperation Minister Leslaw Podkanski,  and Slovak Economic Minister Peter Magvasi.    Kadar later told reporters that the protocol leaves the  agreement essentially unchanged, with only customs elimination  deadlines modified. Accordingly, duties on CEFTA goods -- with  the exception of farm and food products -- will be scrapped by  January 1, 1998, three years ahead of schedule.    As for deregulation of trade in agricultural products, from  July 1 duties on Hungarian exports to Poland will be cut by 50  percent. The original agreement called for these duties to drop  by 20 percent in two years, and by 50 percent in five years.    Hungary agreed with Czech and Slovak partners to lower  duties  on farm goods by 50 percent, instead of 20 percent, by January  1, 1997.    The ministers said they expected trade liberalization  between  the four countries to improve European Union accession chances  and offer better market access for a wide circle of regional  exporters.</p>

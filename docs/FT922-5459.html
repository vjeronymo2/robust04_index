			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Books: History in the broad sweep FROM COUNTER REFORMATION TO GLORIOUS REVOLUTION by Hugh Trevor-Roper, Secker &amp; Warburg, Pounds 25 THIS third collection of Trevor-Roper's essays consists of reprints, all but one; but they can bear a second reading, even at the cost of some repetition  -especially about the great Dutch scholar Grotius, the inspiration of whose life was to unite Protestants and Catholics on the basis of the Anglican Church he so much admired. The Professor thinks that, if it had not been for the Thirty Years War, the ecumenical movement might have got going. Some hopes] It always was chimerical. The most informative essay is on 'Medicine at the Early Stuart Court'. The author had intended a full-length biography of the eminent doctor, Sir Theodore de Mayerne: this is what remains of the project. The most sympathetic account is that of Clarendon, a convincing one is of Prince Rupert, a hostile one is of Bishop Wren, uncle of Sir Christopher. Archbishop Laud is no favourite, for all the work of reparation that he did for the Church; the Puritans did what they could to undo it, but more remains than this historian allows. He likes discussing issues widely - the the width of reading is impressive - rather than in depth. Options are left open - just as well in the case of 'Anglo-Scottish Union'. This makes for exciting reading, but sober historians accept that many of these issues are closed. Personalities make good reading, and they have their place, but it is the estimation of forces - economic, social, political - that counts in the longer run. There never really was a likelihood of an absolutist monarchy in England: the whole balance of forces was against the consensus of the country - it couldn't hold. Again, with the Revolution of 1688, Trevor-Roper supposes 'if William's fleet had been destroyed at sea or his enterprise had foundered in civil war . . .', then what? But James II's fleet would not fight for him; neither would his army. His favourite general and his nephew deserted him, along with his daughters and both parties, Tories as well as Whigs. The whole consensus was against him - proved by the rapid success of the 'glorious' Revolution, and with no bloodshed] I do not care for snap historical generalisations, but will try a provoking thought. The fact that historical events turn out as they do is a fair indication that that is how they would go anyway. Great historians are plodders, researching their subjects in depth for years - compare Hume, Gibbon, Macaulay, Trevelyan, who are all mentioned here. We may fairly say that Trevor-Roper is our most stimulating and discursive, historical essayist.</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / EBRD may finance Slovak N-plant The directors of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development are to meet in London today to discuss financing a nuclear power plant in Slovakia. A final decision  - due after 70 days of consultation  - is set to be one of the most difficult in the bank's short history. If the bank decides to provide 30 per cent of the DM1.3bn (Pounds 530m) needed to complete two partly-built reactors at Mochovce in Slovakia it would be the first time a multilateral development bank had agreed to finance a new nuclear plant. Previous development funding has concentrated on essential safety work at existing plants in eastern Europe. The sensitivity of the project  - a joint venture involving Electricite de France, France's state-owned generator, and Slovensky Energeticky, the Slovak generator  - has encouraged the EBRD to launch a public participation process, and thus avoid any charges of lack of consultation. Today's meeting will be followed on Thursday by the publication of an environmental audit, part of the safety review, and a 'least-cost' analysis which compares Mochovce, a Soviet-designed pressurised water reactor, with conventional gas-fired plants. Opposition to the WWER 440/213 Soviet-designed pressurised water reactors is based on doubts about their safety and their economic viability. Environment groups such as Greenpeace and Global 2000 believe that more should be done to increase energy efficiency and that the cost of gas, supplied by Russia, is being overestimated. These groups presented a petition of over 100,000 names, mostly Austrian, to the bank yesterday. Mr Heiner Luschin, the Austrian EBRD director, questions the safety costs of the project and is uneasy at the EBRD's involvement. '(The situation where) financial support is provided for highly subsidised electricity through an international organisation supposed to promote open-market economies is one I find very difficult to understand,' he says. Mochovce lies around 120km east of Bratislava and 160km from Vienna. Mr Thierry Baudon, the bank's deputy vice president, believes support for Mochovce is a difficult but necessary decision. Support for Mochovce can be 'traded' for Slovak guarantees to close an older, more dangerous, pressurised water nuclear plant at Bohunice, he says. 'You have got to ask why we are going through this nightmare when we could have cooked the figures to show that gas was more profitable. . . but we want to close Bohunice. . . and we would have had no leverage to close it down (without Mochovce).' Mr Baudon recognises that the consequences of the loan may be difficult, however. 'On economic, environmental and safety grounds I deeply believe that this is the right thing,' he says. 'Whether we should do it for the good of our image is a completely different matter.' Others feel less confident about the economic outlook for Mochovce. A study of two partially-built 44O/213s in east Germany three years ago concluded that DM2bn would be needed to bring each unit up to acceptable safety standards. The government decided this cost could not be justified and the plant was never completed. Mochovce is more than 80 per cent complete but has been mothballed for three years. Only a small proportion of the funds required to complete the plant would be spent on construction. The rest would be allocated to upgrading the reactors to acceptable safety levels.</p>

			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> SOVIET HEART DRUG APPROVED  </P> <P> A new treatment for life-threatening heartbeat irregularities is believed to be  the first Soviet drug licensed by a U.S. pharmaceutical company and approved by  the Food and Drug Administration. Officials of Du Pont Co. said last week that  the drug, Ethmozine, is used in the Soviet Union to treat the heart condition  known as ventricular arrhythmia.  </P> <P> The drug appears to be safer than the eight others in its class for patients  who have had congestive heart failure, company officials said. Side effects,  which include nausea and dizziness, occurred in 10% to 15% of patients who  received the drug during clinical trials. The drug will be available in the  United States in September.  </P> <P> About 800,000 to 1.2 million Americans are being treated for life-threatening  ventricular arrhythmias, which are related to more than 300,000 deaths each  year.  </P> <P> The drug, developed in the Soviet Union in 1964, will be marketed by Du Pont  under an agreement in which the Soviets receive royalties of 4% on worldwide  sales, Landgraf said.  </P></p>

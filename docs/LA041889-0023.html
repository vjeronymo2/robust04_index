			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NRC GRANTS A 2ND CHANCE TO PLANT SHUT FOR NAPPING  </P> <P> The Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Monday gave a Pennsylvania nuclear plant  permission to resume operations two years after it was shut down because 33  control room operators slept on the job or neglected their duties.  </P> <P> The NRC voted 3 to 0 to lift the order that had kept the Peach Bottom plant  closed since March 31, 1987, when the commission said its continued operation  would threaten public health and safety.  </P> <P> In granting permission to restart the facility, the commission nevertheless  warned the plant operator against complacency. "We will be watching you very  closely," NRC Chairman Lando W. Zech Jr. said.  </P> <P> Plant officials must complete a checklist of technical items before bringing  the plant to full power, a task that will take several months and be carried  out under the scrutiny of NRC inspectors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Utility Reports Changes  </P> <P> The commission acted after a representative of Philadelphia Electric Co., the  plant operator, said it had undergone radical changes since the NRC  investigated a tip about sleeping on the job and ordered the facility shut  down.  </P> <P> The changes got to the "root causes" of the problem, the NRC's staff said in  recommending that the commission permit the restarting.  </P> <P> There had been a lax "culture" at Peach Bottom, in which plant problems either  were ignored or went unnoticed, the staff said.  </P> <P> "It would at least appear to me that management (before the shutdown) either  was not aware of conditions or, if they were aware of it, they condoned it,"  Zech said before the vote.  </P> <P> "The operators must never again betray the special trust and countenance of the  public," Zech said.  </P> <P> Commissioner James Curtis was out of the country and missed the vote.  Commissioner Kenneth Rogers abstained because he once served on the  Philadelphia Electric board, the NRC said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Costly Down Time  </P> <P> The shutdown cost the company about $250 million for plant modifications,  purchasing replacement power and its share of a $1.25 million fine, the largest  in NRC history.  </P> <P> Many of the problems at Peach Bottom occurred on the overnight shift. On at  least two occasions, according to NRC testimony in 1987, three of the four  control room employees responsible for running the plant were asleep at the  same time. Another time, several of the operators were found huddled around a  personal computer, playing video games.  </P> <P> Of 39 control room operators now at the plant, 24 were there at the time of the  shutdown, and all have been retrained. To discourage napping, high-backed  chairs in the control room have been replaced with less comfortable seating.  </P> <P> In another development, meanwhile, Zech indicated the committee would vote  Thursday on awarding a full-power license to the Shoreham nuclear plant on Long  Island, after hearing the NRC staff report that the $5.5 billion reactor is not  hazardous and is ready to go into service.  </P> <P> All indications are that the Shoreham full-power license will be awarded, but  whether it will ever be used is doubtful. The Long Island Lighting Co. is one  step away from selling the plant to New York state for $1 in exchange for 10  annual rate increases of up to 5%. The state would then decommission and  dismantle the plant.  </P></p>

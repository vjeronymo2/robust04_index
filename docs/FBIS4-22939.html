			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by O.E. Babkin, G.K. Ivakhnyuk, and N.F. Fedorov, </F> Saint Petersburg Technology Institute; UDC 661.183]    [Abstract] A study examined ways of varying the number of  functional groups on the surface of mesoporous and macroporous  carbon sorbents. A method of directed hydroxylation of the  surface of a uniformly mesoporous carbon sorbent that had been  subjected to heat treatment in a vacuum at 2,200C for 4  hours was tested. The carbon specimens were subjected to  chlorination at temperatures between 200 and 600C.  Additional treatment of the chlorinated specimens resulted in  the attachment of hydroxyl groups to the carbon surface. The  said treatment was conducted at 200C until the release of  HCl ceased. The adsorbents thus produced were subjected to  adsorption studies; microcalorimetry; and mass, infrared, and  x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Both qualitative and  quantitative differences between the starting specimens and the  hydroxylated specimens were evident. The infrared and x-ray  photoelectron spectra of the hydroxylated specimens contained  bands with peaks at 1050 and 1120 cm[.sup]-1[/] that were  identified as stretching vibrations of the C-OH bond. Directed  hydroxylation changed the chemical properties of the surface of  the carbon specimens; specifically, it changed the number of  primary centers of adsorption of water vapors. The greatest  number of primary centers of water vapor adsorption formed when  a chlorination temperature of 450C was used. The  proportionality between the number of primary centers of water  vapor adsorption and ceiling water vapor sorption that is  expected during the process of water-vapor saturation as  identical water clusters form on the surface of carbon sorbents  did not occur during the experiments. This lack of  proportionality was attributed to an uneven distribution of  primary centers of water vapor adsorption along the adsorbent's  surface that in turn led to partial coalescence of the water  clusters and to the formation of ``islands'' of water. The  decrease in the number of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the  sorbents that occurred at 200 and 600C caused the surface  of the carrier to fill to a lesser extent. As a result, a  proportionality between the number of primary centers of water  vapor adsorption, ceiling water vapor sorption, and heat of  submersion in water for the hydroxylated specimens began to be  evident. This principle was recommended for use in producing  produce model sorbents that may be effectively used to produce  active and stable immobilized enzyme preparations. The technique  of grafting amino groups to a hydroxylated carbon surface was  said to be superior to that of grafting amino groups to hydrated  silica because the undesirable hydrogen bonds that form in the  case of the silica gel do not form when hydroxylated carbon is  used as a substrate. The surface of the most hydroxylated  specimen produced was determined to contain 1 hydroxyl on every  80 square angstroms, which is sufficient to accommodate at most  about 20 amino groups in the case of an enzyme such as trypsin.  For this reason, multiple-point binding was recommended as  highly desirable for increasing the stability of immobilized  preparations. Figures 4, table 1; references 7: 6 Russian, 1  Western.</p>

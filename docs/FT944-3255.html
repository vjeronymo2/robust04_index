			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Chechen warning exposes rift in Russian military A rift among Russian top brass emerged yesterday as senior military officials criticised the government's effort to subdue the breakaway Chechen republic. General Alexander Lebed and General Boris Gromov, who commanded Soviet forces during the Afghan war, warned that the intervention in Chechnya could lead to a bloody and drawn-out guerrilla war. 'Step by step, the Afghan experience is being repeated in Chechnya,' said Gen Lebed, commander of Russian forces in Moldova. 'We risk getting involved in a war with the entire Moslem world. Individual guerrillas will indefinitely shoot at our tanks and kill our soldiers with single bullets.' Gen Lebed condemned the government for sending 'untrained kids' into the region and said their poor preparation was to blame for the immediate surrender of 47 Russian troops to Chechen forces during the weekend. The criticism, as nine Russian soldiers have already died, highlights how deeply the Chechen crisis is dividing the Russian leadership. A strange alliance of Russian liberal and communist politicians sharply opposed the intervention in the Russian parliament yesterday. The Duma, or lower house, passed an ambivalent resolution describing the government's actions as 'unsatisfactory'. But it urged President Boris Yeltsin to disarm the Chechens and to 'restore legality' in the region which declared its independence from Russia three years ago. Only Mr Vladimir Zhirinovksy, the ultra-nationalist leader, gave his unequivocal backing to the use of force. Russian forces, aiming to encircle Grozny, the Chechen capital, are being impeded by swarms of civilians. The slow-moving Russian intervention appears to have dissolved internal political disputes in Chechnya, and other peoples of the volatile North Caucasus are rallying to the defence of their neighbours. Negotiations between Chechen and Russian representatives in the North Ossetian city of Vladikavkaz continued last night, but made no substantive progress. It was yesterday possible to drive into Grozny in spite of Russian claims to have effectively blockaded the city. The road from neighbouring Ingushetia was crowded with nervous Russian troops and littered with the burnt-out remains of a dozen tanks and trucks. Crossing into Chechnya, there were few visible defences  - only a few concrete blocks thrown across the road. Grizzled Chechen fighters carrying Kalashnikov rifles and Molotov cocktails walked around. On the ground, Russian forces were slowed by encounters with the local people and their supporters. Mr Umar Gudaborshev, 31, a native Ingush, drove from his home in Kazakhstan in central Asia to help. 'I am here to protect Chechnya. It is my homeland,' he said. West's fears, Page 2</p>

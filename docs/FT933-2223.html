			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Treasury hires consultant to shake up top management THE Treasury has brought in a management consultant usually paid about Pounds 2,000 a day to change its organisational culture and increase the effectiveness of its senior officials. Ms Wendy Pritchard, who has helped push through change at big companies including BP and Lloyds Bank is working with top Treasury officials under Sir Terry Burns, the permanent secretary. The radical move to bring in an outside consultant to shed light on the Treasury's closed world is a sign of the pressure on the mandarins to respond to sustained criticism that the department is out of touch and inward looking. Ms Pritchard, who runs her own London-based consultancy, has been hired to work part-time. She is known in the consultancy world for working intensively behind closed doors with senior managers to discuss how they manage their workforce and relate to each other. Ms Pritchard said: 'I find all this (publicity) slightly alarming as I normally try to keep out of the newspapers.' She is described as a 'an entrepreneur who acts as general practitioner to top executives,' by Mr Richard Beckhard, a New York based consultant who has collaborated with her. Ms Pritchard is among a small number of people in management consultancy in her field of 'change management'. A close associate said she that would normally charge about Pounds 2,000 a day. 'This kind of person does not come cheap,' he said. Ms Pritchard did not comment on how much the Treasury was paying her. The Treasury said it had nothing to say on an internal management exercise. Ms Pritchard has previously been employed full time at Rank Xerox, and at Shell International, where she worked for 15 years and was head of organisational effectiveness. She set up her consultancy, Wendy Pritchard Associates, about three years ago. Recently advised the Department of Health on how to introduce change into the health service. The consultant was introduced by Sir Terry to senior Treasury officials at an unpublicised meeting in a Berkshire hotel in May. The gathering was mainly for top 15 or so people who constitute the Treasury 'management board' and who are in charge of the 1,500-strong organisation. Mr Howard Davies, director general of the Confederation of British Industry and a former McKinsey consultant, attended a dinner after the meeting to review how the Treasury could change the way it managed decisions in its field of economic policy and public spending.</p>

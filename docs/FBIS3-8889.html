			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Chief Editor Jan Smolec in the "Public Matter" </F> column]    [Text] After the conclusion of yesterday's meeting of the  National Council of the Slovak Republic [where a no-confidence  vote in Meciar's government was passed], our editorial office  was flooded with desperate telephone calls. Often through  tears, the question could be heard: "WHAT IS GOING TO BECOME OF  US SLOVAKS?"    People's fears are justified. Power has been seized by  politicians who did not even move a finger for the independent  Slovak Republic.    Vladimir Meciar, the architect of Slovak independence and  for  three years the most popular politician in Slovakia, has had to  vacate the prime minister's seat under the influence of a  Czechoslovakist, communist, and Hungarian conspiracy.    Who deserves the greatest credit for this political reversal  on Slovakia's political scene?    First and foremost, the Slovak president and representatives  of the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] and the Christian  Democratic Movement [KDH]. Henceforth, the life of the Slovak  society will be influenced, for example, by Peter Weiss, an heir  of the communists from whom we have not heard one word of a  sincere declaration of affection for the Slovak nation. Jan  Carnogursky, who had voted against Slovak sovereignty, may  return to the Slovak Government. While the Slovak Metropolitan  Archbishop Jan Sokol was praying for sovereignty, this Christian  politician voted against it. Apparently from shame, the  archbishop hid his face in the palms of his hands.    These people, together with the hate-filled [Alliance of  Democrats Chairman Milan] Knazko and, of course, with exemplary  irredentists, will lead Slovakia from now on. Where do you  think they will lead it? They may want to steer the ship back  to Czechoslovakist or other dangerous waters. Fortunately,  there exist politicians, writers, members of the intelligentsia,  journalists, and, most important of all, Slovaks who will  carefully monitor their actions. For the time being, there also  still exists the editorial staff of REPUBLIKA. The present  victors will surely try to liquidate our newspaper and break up  the editorial team.    They broke us up once before, but we came back.    We will not surrender.    The fight for Slovakia continues.</p>

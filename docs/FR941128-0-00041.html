			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Interstate Mining Compact Commission (IMCC), which represents the natural resource interests of its 17 member States, strongly supported the rule agreeing with OSM's analysis and conclusions in the preamble to the proposed rule and noting that the States would not support a situation where environmentally sensitive sites are left unattended, unabated, or without meaningful followup in the way of alternative enforcement proceedings such as those required in the proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NCA and the Kentucky Coal Association fully supported the proposed rule, characterizing it as a proper exercise of OSM's discretion to provide regulatory authorities the necessary flexibility to deploy limited resources in an efficient manner. The NCA/AMC also supported the rule pointing out that along with the rules practical benefits, the regulatory history of the Act shows that there is precedent for the selective inspection of mines that pose no threat to the environment as exemplified by the 1982 revised Federal rules that allowed a reduction in the partial inspection frequency for ``inactive'' operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) stated that it is not unreasonable for OSM to conduct complete inspections twice a year at a minimum on sites causing or likely to cause water pollution or other nonpoint source problems. However, the EPA recommended that the rule include criteria upon which the frequency of inspections would be based, including the potential for the site to become further degraded. As discussed later in this preamble, the final rule will incorporate criteria, including a criterion similar to that suggested by EPA, that must be taken into consideration and documented before regulatory authorities can reduce inspection frequencies at abandoned sites. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter said that OSM'S statement in the preamble to the proposed rule that reducing inspections at abandoned sites ``would allow the regulatory authorities to redirect those inspection resources to operations where inspection and enforcement would achieve the intended results'' points to the failure of regulatory authorities to achieve the intended results in the first place by preventing non-compliance through inspection and enforcement during the mining and reclamation phases. The commenter questioned why OSM is not concerning itself with how to prevent abandonment rather than a way to assist operators through reduced inspections. The commenter added that since existing regulations require adequate bond be in place, abandonment becomes irrelevant if those regulations are properly implemented. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM concurs with the commenter's view that not enough has been done in the past to prevent abandonment and will place greater emphasis on prevention. Prevention of environmental problems and inadequate performance bonds often associated with abandoned sites are priorities to OSM and the agency will work with the States to improve efforts in these key areas. This rule promotes a policy of prevention because it frees resources that can focus on existing or potential problems at high risk sites that would result in long term adverse effects or reclamation difficulties in the event of abandonment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NWF opposed the proposed reduction in the minimum inspection frequency for abandoned sites because it allegedly fails to provide adequately for the protection of public health and safety and the environment from the adverse impacts of improperly conducted coal mining and operations, and therefore contravenes the underlying purpose of the Act. They maintained that the dramatic reduction in frequency or even elimination of inspections altogether at abandoned sites as proposed would unquestionably heighten the risk that site conditions may worsen to create an imminent harm and trigger violations of on-or-off site performance standards in addition to those violations already cited by a regulatory authority. NWF stated that abandoned sites need to be monitored to avert deterioration of site conditions into imminent harms, to ensure no uncited violations exist, to provide early warning to the public in the event of imminent harm and to determine or prioritize sites that are eligible for abandoned mine lands funding. They urged that OSM withdraw this proposal, or at a minimum, that a more carefully designed, comprehensive clear and precise rule, explained in greater detail, be substituted. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / US consumer prices up: Rise prompts share and bond sales on fears that inflationary pressures are reviving REPORTS of a sharp increase in US consumer prices last month prompted heavy selling of shares and bonds yesterday on fears that US inflationary pressures are reviving. The Labour Department said the consumer price index rose 0.4 per cent between March and April and at an annual rate of 3.7 per cent over the last quarter. On Wednesday it reported a 0.6 per cent rise in producer prices last month. In late trading the benchmark long bond was down 1 5/32 at 102 7/32 to yield 6.944 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 34.32 points lower at 3,447.99. 'There's no cause for long-term concern,' President Bill Clinton told reporters, but 'we have to watch it.' The figures puzzled many analysts because consumer demand is seen as too weak to support a significant acceleration of inflation. Wage costs remain subdued. Consumer prices were boosted last month by an erratic rise in food prices. However, the 'core' consumer price index  - which excludes food and energy  -rose 0.4 per cent and at an annual rate of 4.1 per cent over the past three months. Core producer prices have also risen rapidly in recent months. 'Inflation will stabilise at 3-3.5 per cent this year,' said Mr David Wyss, chief economist at DRI-McGraw Hill, a forecasting group. 'Hopes that it would fall to 2.5-3.0 per cent were always unrealistic.' Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers in New York, said the figures seemed 'a bit high given the modest pace of growth'. Separately, the Commerce Department reported a 1.2 per cent increase in retail sales last month, a stronger than expected rebound after bad weather hit sales in March. The recovery was led by car sales, which rose 3 per cent from March. Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, warned that the sales rebound was modest and indicated an annual rate of sales growth of only 2.4 per cent, lower than the rate of inflation. A 12 per cent increase in car sales compared with April last year, however, was evidence that 'the president's cut-the-deficit, lower interest rate strategy is setting the stage for growth.' Mr Wyss predicted a 'soft' second quarter with economic growth at an annual rate of 2.5 per cent, up from 1.8 per cent in the first quarter. The recovery, however, would gather momentum in the second half of the year.</p>

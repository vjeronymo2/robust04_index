			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Sunday ban 'discriminatory' FOUR WOMEN shopworkers are claiming that an enforced closure of a West Yorkshire branch of B&amp;Q, the DIY chain, under the 1950 Shops Act is discriminatory because a ban on Sunday working in the retail sector affects women more than men. Their challenge in the High Court, which begins today, marks the last round in the battle between retailers and local authorities in England and Wales over Sunday trading, because all other avenues have been exhausted. The women are suing Kirklees council in West Yorkshire for lost wages after the enforced Sunday closure of the chain's Dewsbury store for 12 weeks in 1991. They are also seeking an injunction preventing the council from forcing a closure of the store on Sundays on the grounds that this will take away their right to Sunday employment. The court will also hear a fresh application by the council for an injunction to close the store on Sundays after last October's ruling by the European Court of Justice that the 1950 Shops Act, which governs Sunday trading in England and Wales, is not incompatible with European law. When the council obtained a temporary injunction to close the Dewsbury store in 1991, B&amp;Q offered the women alternative Monday-to-Saturday work. All but one said they were unable to accept because of family arrangements. B&amp;Q, which is opposing the move to close the store, says it has 'a mass of statistical evidence' to support the contention that women are disproportionately affected by Sunday trading bans. More than 60 per cent of its Sunday staff are women, it says, and it has evidence that enforcement of the Shops Act across England and Wales would lead to the loss of between 120,000 and 150,000 part-time jobs in the retail sector, 80 per cent of which are taken by women. B&amp;Q will argue that the 1950 legislation is discriminatory and should not be enforced. Mr Tony Askham, B&amp;Q's solicitor, said the 1989 Employment Act specifically provides that any legislation which is discriminatory on grounds of sex and predates the 1975 Sex Discrimination Act should be treated as 'of no effect'. In addition, he said, European law imposes on the government and local authorities an obligation to uphold the principles of equal treatment in the Treaty of Rome and the 1977 equal-treatment directive. If there is a case that the 1950 act is sexually discriminatory then it is up to a local authority trying to enforce the law to show that the purpose of the legislation is objectively justifiable on grounds unrelated to sex, headded. Both sides and the government appear to accept that the case might have to go to the European Court and take up to two years to resolve. The only hope of short-circuiting the issue lies with the government bringing forward legislation to reform the act.</p>

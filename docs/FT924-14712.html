			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / International Company News: ANSETT Transport Industries may be floated 'at some stage in the future' ANSETT Transport Industries, the aviation group owned jointly owned by TNT and News Corporation, may be floated 'at some stage in the future,' TNT said yesterday. Mr David Mortimer, who last week replaced Sir Peter Abeles as TNT managing director, said that flotation was a long-term option for Ansett, which lost ADollars 132m in the year to June. However, he said Ansett would first have to demonstrate an improved earnings record. Ansett would reduce debt by disposing of non-core activities such as its Hayman Island tourist resort. News Corporation has said it has long-term plans to sell its 50 per cent stakes in Ansett and Ansett Worldwide Aviation Services an aircraft leasing associate. Mr Mortimer said AWAS would have to be recapitalised, probably in the next three years, to bolster its competitive position.</p>

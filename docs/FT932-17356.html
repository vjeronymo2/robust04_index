			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Arts: Barstow's 'Fidelio' - Opera The latest run of Fidelio performances at Covent Garden brings Josephine Barstow to the title role. This immediately raises the production (first seen in 1990, first revived last September) on to a higher plane of dramatic vitality than it has so far reached. There are, however, still higher ones yet to be attained. Though now shorn of those dreadful passages of re-written dialogue inserted by the original producer, Adolf Dresen, the staging remains limp and lacklustre - purposelessly fussy in domestic scenes, hovering on the edge of comical ineptitude in the finale. And withal Miss Barstow, taut in bearing, intent in every glance and gesture, anchors the opera in dramatic credibility in spite of every passing threat thereto. On the most basic level, as Tuesday's performance showed, she remains physically the most credible of boy-girls - tall, coltish, made scrawny by desperation and determination. Beyond this, she carries within her that essential set-apart-ness which not only proves attractive to Marzelline and plausible to Rocco but chimes with the character's effect on Beethoven's musical development of the opera. There are, I know, those pitiable souls unresponsive to the controlled magnetism of the Barstow stage presence, alienated by the intense, complicated quality of vocal timbre and not compensated by the fiery musicianship that underlies it. This singer has always struggled with Leonore's music (but few indeed are those who have not]), yet it seems to me that she now deals with it far more fluently than in those Glyndebourne and ENO Fidelios more than a decade ago. To the doubters I would simply reply by first affirming that this is of course not the gloriously outpouring Heldensopran Leonore of legend; and by then insisting that it is an achievement all the more remarkable, more meaningful, for that. Other valuable elements abound in the revival: once they have come together more cohesively, a Fidelio of real ensemble character is in prospect. The young couple, Gillian Webster and Lynton Atkinson, are appealing; there is an absolutely first-rate Rocco - robust, bluff, calculating and craven all at one go - from the Austrian bass Kurt Rydl (house debut), whose only misjudgment is an excess of loud singing. Reiner Goldberg's Florestan, substituted at short notice for Josef Protschka's, is reedy, edgy, affecting. While Willard White, warm-toned and innately noble in stage personality, may not seem obvious casting for Pizarro, his performance certainly registers. Jeffrey Tate conducts - not always precisely, but with energy (apart from a couple of slack tempos in Act 2), dramatic sensitivity, a winning altertness to the specific musical workings of every page and passage. Royal Opera House: in repertory until April 15</p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: MEPC shares rise on upbeat statement Shares in MEPC, the property group, rose 29p to 561p yesterday after Lord Blakenham, the chairman, told the annual meeting that the company was in a far healthier position than a year ago with gearing at 48 per cent against 82 per cent. He said the property market in general was on the move. On Tuesday, Mr James Tuckey, chief executive, said the company's Northridge Fashion Centre in the San Fernando Valley, Los Angeles, had been affected by the earthquake in southern California. However, the group had substantial insurance to cover against earthquake damage, including business disruption and loss of rent. MEPC acquired the property last month.</p>

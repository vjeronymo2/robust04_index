			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / PM warns of difficult decisions on social spending MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday said Britain was far from alone in facing tough decisions on public spending as he prefaced his party's Christchurch by-election campaign by saying voters preferred 'home truths' to 'empty promises'. Speaking in Tokyo before returning to Britain last night, the prime minister shrugged off gloomy opinion polls and said discussions at the Tokyo summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations had vindicated his determination to control social expenditure. Britain's 'supply side' approach to creating jobs and fostering economic growth had also been endorsed, he added. Speaking only hours before Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman, launched the campaign at Christchurch, Dorset, where a third of the population are pensioners, Mr Major said all G7 countries except Japan needed to cut their budget deficits. This would have repercussions on social spending. 'All of us need to keep social costs within the bounds of what we can afford,' Mr Major said. 'It will mean difficult decisions . . . Provided people understand what lies behind them and what the impact of them will be, I think people will prefer those home truths rather than empty promises.' Mr Major insisted the poorest sections of the population had nothing to fear from prospective cuts in social spending. However, the Department of Social Security is understood to be looking at options such as giving incentives to under-30s to opt out of the state pension scheme. Labour and the Liberal Democrats believe the Tories have made a tactical error in highlighting the public spending review when facing an important by-election test, caused by the death of Mr Robert Adley. The Tories had a majority of 23,000 in Christchurch at the last election. A Gallup opinion poll in the Daily Telegraph yesterday put the Tories in third place nationally, behind Labour and the Liberal Democrats and Mr Major's personal rating at a record low for a prime minister. Speaking in Christchurch, Sir Norman Fowler, said: 'We're comfortable with the position where the opinion polls show us as underdogs.' In Tokyo, Mr Major maintained that 'short-term sensational matters' were damaging the government's popularity at a time when Britain was experiencing low inflation, falling unemployment and had interest rates down at 6 per cent.

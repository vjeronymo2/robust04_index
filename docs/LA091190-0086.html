			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRM EXPANDS DISTRIBUTION OF NEW AIDS DRUG  </P> <P> The free distribution of the promising AIDS drug DDC is being widened to  include possibly thousands more patients, a drug company announced Monday.  </P> <P> In June, the Food and Drug Administration gave Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. of  Nutley, N.J., permission to provide dideoxycytidine, or DDC, to AIDS patients  who cannot take the two currently available drugs to combat the AIDS virus.  </P> <P> Those drugs are AZT, the only fully approved AIDS-fighting drug, and DDI, an  experimental drug already offered through a similar expanded access program.  </P> <P> About 100 people with AIDS or advanced AIDS-related complex have been receiving  DDC through that route, and another 1,000 patients are taking the drug in the  more strictly monitored tests required for government drug approval, said Paul  Oestreicher, a Hoffmann-La Roche spokesman.  </P> <P> Now, the drug maker is dropping the requirement that a doctor must demonstrate  that a patient cannot take DDI before being allowed to start DDC. That move  will likely increase the number of patients in the expanded-access program. "It  could potentially be thousands more," Oestreicher said.  </P> <P> So far, the most serious side effect of DDC has been pain in the nerves of the  feet and hands. About 10% of patients eventually have to stop therapy because  of side effects, Oestreicher said.  </P></p>

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / BA denies claim over soldiers British Airways and the Ministry of Defence yesterday denied allegations that a jet trapped in Kuwait during the early stages of the Gulf crisis was a 'Trojan horse' flying elite troops to the emirate, Reuter reports from London. Reports in a Scottish newspaper alleged that 32 Special Air Service (SAS) men boarded the Boeing 747 two minutes before it took off from London on August 1, 1990, and then disappeared when it landed in Kuwait. The Ministry of Defence said: 'We don't discuss special forces, but to my knowledge there were no military personnel on board.' British Airways gave a categoric denial SAS men were on board.</p>

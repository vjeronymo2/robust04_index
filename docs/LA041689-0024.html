			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NANCY REAGAN AT DRUG RAID  </P> <P> So this is what drug control has come to! A publicity-avaricious female with  "Nancy" scrolled across the front of her jacket and a politically ambitious  police chief grinning at us!  </P> <P> This is not even to mention the taxpayers' dollars spent on the  "air-conditioned motor home parked beside the alleged rock house" which "had  been ordered up for Mrs. Reagan's comfort because 'she's been on her feet all  day,' " and to which she could repair with her police chief host to munch fruit  salad. A regular high-society party!  </P> <P> Has she no shame, being the focal point of this kind of egocentric carrying on?  Has Gates no shame using this tragic comedy to what he thinks is going to be a  governorship? (I have news for him!) Have you no shame for printing it? And  have I no shame for reading it?  </P> <P> RICHARD F. CASSADY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

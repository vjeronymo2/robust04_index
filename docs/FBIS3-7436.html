"We are going work for a negotiated settlement," In Sopheap,  a representative for the guerrillas in Phnom Penh told AFP.    The comments contrasted with a combative statement made  earlier Monday by Khmer Rouge radio.    The Khmer Rouge representative could not confirm rumors  circulating here that the guerrillas' nominal leader, Khieu  Samphan, would soon be arriving in Phnom Penh.    Cambodia's co-prime minister, Hun Sen, told AFP Monday that  the government "left the door open" to negotiations with the  Khmer Rouge.    Cambodian Government forces launched a major offensive  against Khmer Rouge-held territories earlier this month.</p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Finance and the Family: Proof that he who ventures wins - Philip Coggan examines the record of Pantheon International Participations, which profits from a somewhat esoteric strategy - Investment Trusts ONE OF THE best-performing investment trusts over the past year could well be one of the least known. Indeed, the trust's name, Pantheon International Participations, or PIP for short, does not give much of a clue as to what it does - investing in other people's venture capital funds. This rather esoteric-sounding strategy has been fairly successful in recent times - according to Micropal, it was the fourth best-performing non-split capital investment trust over the year to April 1 (mid-market to mid-market with income re-invested) with a rise of 93.5 per cent. It was top of the venture capital sector over that period and third over both the three- and five-year periods. What is the rationale for PIP's investment policy? Most venture capital trusts buy direct equity holdings - but this can involve them in a lot of hands-on management if the companies get into difficulties. PIP avoids that problem. Furthermore, PIP's policy means its portfolio is highly diversified. Each of the funds in which it invests has a wide range of holdings - so the damage caused by the failure of any one company is much smaller. Other venture capital trusts, such as Drayton Consolidated, have been hit badly by prominent corporate collapses. PIP also can benefit by buying so-called 'secondary interests.' Many venture capital funds are launched on a private basis, with fund managers persuading a number of institutions to participate. If one of those institutions then wants to sell, PIP can acquire their holdings. And given the lack of alternative purchasers, usually it can buy at a discount. Some of the recent uplift in performance, however, has come from a special factor. In February 1989, the trust purchased approximately Pounds 20m of unquoted assets from the water authorities. The bulk of the consideration was in the form of convertible loan stock. This had a nominal rate of interest - 3 per cent - which was rolled up to allow the water authorities to purchase more ordinary shares when conversion became profitable. Since then, the water authorities have been replaced as owners of the convertible by the National Rivers Authority, which decided it wanted to realise the convertible for cash. PIP has agreed to buy it back, but at a discount to face value. This resulted in a double boost to net asset value per share - the value of the debt fell and the prospect of the creation of a large number of new shares disappeared. But there is hope of a more fundamental pick-up in net asset values as the US and UK economies recover. Venture capital funds tend to lag behind the quoted sector. Valuations are based on the previous year's profits, and thus will reflect the depressed conditions of 1992. Stock market investors already are anticipating the increases in profits in late 1993 and 1994; eventually the unquoted sector could catch up. Of course, the whole issue of valuation is one which has dogged the venture capital sector. Investors have been disillusioned as managers have written down their previous valuations in response to bad news. The result has been that trusts have traded at wide discounts to net asset values - 33 per cent in the case of Electra, the biggest trust in the sector. (PIP stands at a 20 per cent discount.) PIP says it scrutinises the valuations given by the managers of funds in which it invests - and applies a discount if necessary. It never increases the manager's valuation. But Lewis Aaron, investment trust analyst at SG Warburg, says that PIP has in the past bought portfolios at a discount and then written up the holding to asset value. 'That is not necessarily a conservative approach,' he points out. He stresses, however, that manager Rhoddy Swire probably has the best knowledge of US venture capital funds of anyone he has met. The group has a large concentration of its portfolio in the US, where the venture capital market is more developed than elsewhere. At June 30 1992, its UK content was 43.8 per cent (funds 27.2, unquoted 8.4, gilts 8.2) and the US portion was 51.4 per cent (funds 44, unquoted 5.8, quoted 1.6). Japanese and continental funds made up the remainder. PIP's largest 10 investments at June 30, 1992 were: Juno International Participations; Scotia Holdings; Sequoia Capital IV; Grosvenor Technology Fund; Apax Ventures II; New Enterprise Associates III; APA Excelsior Venture Capital Holdings (Jersey); Southwest Enterprise Associates; Fleming Ventures; and East of Scotland Industrial Investments. The trust was floated in September 1987 as GT Ventures. Although it was launched a month in advance of the crash, it did not invest any money before Black Monday, and so was unaffected by the stock market turbulence that followed. Since then, Swire has set up an independent management company, Pantheon, to run the trust. GT sold its remaining holding in Pantheon last year and the trust's name was accordingly changed from GT Venture. Any venture capital fund is risky, and PIP is not for the cautious or for the short-term, investor. Warburg's Aaron says the trust might be attractive to those who believe, like him, that it is quite a good time to be exposed to the US venture capital sector - particularly in view of the stimulus package proposed by President Bill Clinton. Key facts At the end of December, the trust's gross assets were Pounds 35.3m and the net assets were Pounds 27.8m. As of April 14, the trust's net assets per share were 176.1p, according to NatWest Securities. At 142p, the shares were trading on a discount of 19.6 per cent and a yield of 2.2 per cent. Board Thomas Griffin, chairman, was one of the founders of GT Management. The other directors are: John Brakell, the manager (venture capital) at Postel Investment Management; Alain Lefebvre, a director of a number of continental investment companies; Richard Stanley, a director of Friends Provident; Lionel Sackville, chairman of Union Jack Oil; and Swire.

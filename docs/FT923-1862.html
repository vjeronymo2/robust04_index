			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Moscow faces bitter fight over economic legislation THE Russian government is to present a series of economic and constitutional acts to the next session of the Russian parliament, opening tomorrow. The radical legislation, coupled with the worsening economic situation, is likely to provoke an open and bitter struggle between the different levels of state power, jeopardising the survival of economic reforms and fledgling democratic institutions. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, is expected to defend the government's record and demand that parliament support a return to fiscal and monetary discipline after a relaxation of controls. Mr Gaidar told the Interfax news agency at the end of last week that it was essential to 'consolidate a proper financial and credit policy since further attempts to retreat (from it) would lead not to a revival of industrial production but to the destruction of the finance and credit system and of the national currency'. All key indicators have deteriorated sharply. The latest official figures show a budget deficit of Rbs950bn on a total budget of Rbs3,300bn; inflation is said by the government to be running at 20-25 per cent a month, and accelerating; and production is falling at an average of 20 per cent a year. The state of the finances will make further credits from the International Monetary Fund - through a standby agreement on which negotiations restart shortly - difficult to achieve. However, few government officials now seem to believe in the possibility of substantial foreign aid. However, President Boris Yeltsin is in an uncompromising mood, and will attempt to push a series of measures through a hostile parliament. These include: A draft constitution, giving substantial powers to the president and enshrining his right to rule by decree. It is scheduled for introduction to parliament in about a month. The issue is likely to be the most contentious among parliamentarians anxious to preserve their powers, and may lead Mr Yeltsin to take it over their heads in a referendum. A law on the government, which is expected to give the president the right to appoint ministers, subject only to consultation with parliamentary committees. Parliament has insisted on retaining the right, which it voluntarily and temporarily suspended nearly a year ago, to veto ministerial appointments. A law on bankruptcy, which has so far been refused by parliament. Mr Yeltsin has issued a decree allowing companies to be declared bankrupt, but it has not been ratified and experts doubt it would survive legal challenge. Mr Yeltsin, whose popularity has been slipping, has sought in recent weeks to build bridges with his opponents in parliament, chief among them Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker. However, Mr Khasbulatov continues to claim that parliament is on an equal footing with the presidency and government.</p>

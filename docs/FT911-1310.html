			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Money Markets: Rate uncertainties CURRENCIES AND interest rates have entered an uncertain period, with the dollar volatile and the US Federal Reserve cutting its discount rate last week. The two events were not linked. The dollar was already retreating when the Fed cut, but then rallied on Friday's US employment data. A surge in demand for the dollar last Monday morning took it to a peak of DM1.7825, following the failure of ministers from the Group of Seven to agree on a co-ordinated rate cutting policy. Expectations that the US economy will soon recover and the lack of an interest rate agreement provided excuses to buy the currency. Friday's better than expected employment data might be the first concrete sign of recovery, while the lack of a G7 agreement on rates was quickly shown to be no barrier to monetary easing by the Fed. The Bank of Canada followed with a larger than expected cut of 16 basis points to 9.33 per cent in its lending rate to the domestic banking system and it appears that Japan may cut its discount rate in the near future. But any moves in sympathy from Europe are likely to be severely restricted by the German view. The Bundesbank did not tighten credit policies at Thursday council meeting, but it was made clear that consideration of lower rates was not on the agenda. France might like to cut rates, but is hampered while the French franc remains at the bottom of the European exchange rate mechanism. Caution on further cuts in UK bank base rates have been signalled several times by the Bank of England recently. Last week's losses by the ruling Conservative Party at local government elections are unlikely to produce any early change of heart.</p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Vatican makes waves at Cairo conference The 17-strong Vatican delegation is among the biggest per capita of any attending the International Conference on Population and Development, given UN figures putting Vatican City population at 1,000. By yesterday fuming delegates from many countries felt that the Holy See was wielding disproportionate influence in the conference proceedings. While top diplomats and career lobbyists grudgingly marvelled at the Vatican's discipline and tenacity in holding up consensus on the conference's critical text on abortion, many also asked if it was appropriate to have a religion represented at a convocation of nation states. 'If they are here, the Buddhists, the Moslems and the Hindus should be here; they have no right being here,' a European diplomat said. Such views were being widely voiced. 'The Vatican is the only state in the world that has no children and no mothers, but still it has been able to hold up all the rest of the countries in agreeing this important document,' one UN official said. 'Does the Vatican rule the world?' asked an exasperated Mr Maher Mahran, Egypt's population minister. 'If they are not going to negotiate, why did they come?' In response, Vatican officials said they had every right to be at the conference as they were among the world's biggest providers of health care, through almost 100,000 clinics and hospitals. 'We may not be a traditional nation state, but we're the only organisation here with responsibilities worldwide,' said one delegate. Critics argued, however, that unlike all other states which have to govern people with health problems and formulate population policies, the Vatican was in Cairo principally to defend the tenets of a religion. Abortion, mentioned no more than a dozen times in the 133-page draft text intended to offer a broad developmental approach to global population stabilisation, is anathema to the Catholic faith. Terms such as 'safe abortion' cannot be squared with a faith for which every abortion is the ending of a human life. Indeed, one Holy See delegate admitted that, above all, the Vatican wanted to prevent any possibility that the final Cairo declaration could be open to interpretation as offering an internationally sanctioned right to abortion. The Vatican's critics have vehemently argued that no such right is sought, but rather the right of women to have access to 'safe, effective, humane health care,' to quote the World Health Organisation, and an acceptance that since the occurrence of abortion is an unassailable fact, governments should 'deal forthrightly with unsafe abortion as a major public health concern,' to quote the contested draft text. But in haggling over the uneasy mesh of theological and UN conference terminology, the Holy See has proved a tough belligerent. As Ms Francis Kissling, president of Catholics for Free Choice, put it: 'They're good - they're intelligent, suave, sophisticated, tenacious. These people have been doing diplomacy for 1,500 years. This is the former Holy Roman Empire we're dealing with: they've made and unmade kings.' Some diplomats said the Vatican's strength also derived from having placed effective representatives within national delegations. 'They are in with Malta, Guatemala: you don't know where they are,' a European official declared. The Vatican is additionally seen to be ably led, by Archbishop Renato Martino, the Holy See's observer at the UN, whom one official characterised reverently as 'the most brilliant Vatican negotiator in the world'. Bishop James McHugh, bishop of New Jersey and chief interlocutor with the US, has also won grudging admiration. By last night, the Vatican had managed to keep at least 10 allied states from falling in behind the abortion text. Many (Baroness Chalker, head of the UK delegation among them) felt that the Vatican and these states should simply state their objections and allow the conference to move on: 'If they're going to enter a reservation but not wreck the conference, surely they should enter one now.' The Holy See's representatives vehemently deny they intend to wreck the conference, but some other delegates believe the Vatican's intransigence in Cairo may weaken its position in future world gatherings. 'They have seriously overplayed their hand,' says Ms Kissling, who cites a string of polls indicating that most faithful in a host of Catholic countries have long since forsaken Papal edicts on family planning.</p>

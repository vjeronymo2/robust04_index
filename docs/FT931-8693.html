			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Radical plan for balance sheets announced THE AMOUNT of debt declared in companies' accounts will increase substantially and profits will fall under radical proposals unveiled yesterday by the UK's accounting standards body. Under the proposals companies, particularly banks, will be forced to include on their balance sheets information which they have previously been able to conceal in obscure notes to their accounts. The draft rules introduce tough requirements on the treatment of many complex accounting devices used by a growing number of companies to conceal liabilities or inflate profits. They could become mandatory by the end of this year. Fred 4, the financial reporting exposure draft on off-balance-sheet financing, is likely to lead to the biggest row yet between companies and the Accounting Standards Board since its creation more than two years ago. Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the board, said: 'The whole subject has had an unsavoury air in the past. These proposals break new ground and will cast much-needed light into a murky corner.' The draft says that companies must show on their balance sheets as assets any transactions from which they receive benefits, and as liabilities any by which they are exposed to risk. Such transactions - previously off balance sheet - will include sale and repurchase agreements, by which a company appears to have transferred an asset to a third party but in fact has the right or requirement to buy it back after a certain period. Companies with certain securitised assets - those placed in a separate company and sold on to other parties - will have to provide a 'linked presentation' on the balance sheet showing the true state of underlying assets and liabilities. Businesses with a range of currency exposures will also have to show the full extent of these risks separately rather than offsetting them against one another. The draft standard includes a series of illustrative examples of transactions in an effort to ensure that companies obey the spirit, and not simply the letter of the regulations. Mr Tweedie warned that the board would act quickly to stamp out any attempts by companies to introduce any new devices intended to skirt the rules. Bankers complained that the plan would make it difficult for them to securitise credit card business, which they are now considering. Mr Malcolm Veale, head of NatWest securitisation, said the process required by the rules was 'totally impractical'. A growing number of companies have been using an expanding range of obscure, rule-bending devices to conceal their full liabilities from readers of their accounts. 'It's impossible to generalise,' said Mr Tweedie. 'Every scheme I have looked at is different.' It has taken a long time for standard-setters to take the subject seriously. This partly reflects a rearguard action by companies. Banks were concerned that they would breach the European Community's capital adequacy requirements if forced to include securitised assets such as mortgages on their balance sheets.

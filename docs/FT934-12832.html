			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Management: The Russians are coming British-based companies seeking to develop their sales or establish an operating presence in Russia, the Ukraine and the other independent republics could do worse than contact Philip Crossland. The ex-chairman of Racal Chubb - he left the group in April last year - is running a scheme aimed at training young managers from the former Soviet Union. Similar to an initiative organised by the Koerber Foundation in Hamburg, it has three elements: Selection process followed by English language instruction and proficiency testing in Moscow (funded by the Reforms Management Foundation, a Moscow institute). Management instruction in the UK. A seven-week course at Kingston University designed to provide participants with a solid foundation in the theory and practice of management and an understanding of the market economy. Secondment to a western company for approximately three to nine months. The first 10 managers - whose backgrounds are a mixture of industrial and commercial - have just completed the first part of their course. They are now set to join the participating companies, which include National Power, Sea Containers, Bristol Myers Squibb, the Wellcome Foundation, and the Anglo/French computing services group Sema. Crossland, who says the benefit for companies will be a greater understanding of business opportunities in the new states, is eager to hear from potential sponsors. His aim is within two years to match the Koerber Foundation, which will have 80 Russian graduates passing through its doors in 1993. 'We are dealing with western companies which already have operations in Russia, or who just see Russia as a prospective market,' he explains, 'but we are happy to consider companies which have a joint venture and want to put one of their own Russians through the programme.' Crossland can be contacted on 0420-87251 (Fax 0420-541067)</p>

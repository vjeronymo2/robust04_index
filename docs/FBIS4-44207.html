			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Charles Lambroschini: "The Weight of the </F> Past"]    [Excerpts] France's solitude in the Rwandan affair confirms  an old rule of foreign policy: You do not take risks by  consensus.    It was on its own initiative that the French Government  decided to offer the United Nations 2,000 troops to go and  protect the pockets of Tutsi refugees surrounded by Hutus.  [passage omitted]    However, yesterday's refusal by the OAU to support the  intervention was a jolt for the diplomatic machinery. In the  eyes of the former colonies, the motive of humanitarian aid  stated by France is just an excuse. The former colonial power  can only be driven by impure intentions.    The point has been reached where the OAU is putting its own  impotence down to a plot by white powers. The official  communique states that if the OAU has been unable to set up a  peacekeeping force that could have put an end to the massacre,  it was because the developed countries have provided neither  logistic nor financial assistance. A supposedly decisive  indicator of this maneuver is the fact that, two months after  the Security Council decided to send a force of 5,500 blue  helmets from nine African states into Rwanda, only 550 troops  have been effectively deployed.    The carnage in Rwanda can be traced back to the fact that  African reality is first and foremost tribal in nature. An  ancient feeling of hate continues to oppose the Hutus, the  majority and former vassals, and the Tutsis, the feudal  minority. Between 1990 and 1993, French support for the  majority race seemed to be in line with the democratic ideals of  the West. However, it clashed with the local situation.    The Tutsis in the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front], the rebel  movement that now has the upper hand militarily, thus remain  determined to sabotage any attempts at French intervention.  They have the implicit support of Belgium, which has two  reasons for taking their side. At the time of colonization, the  governors sent by Brussels found it more effective to give their  support to the maintaining of the traditional balance, i.e.,  Tutsis on top and the Hutus on the bottom. Since independence,  Brussels has reproached Paris for supplanting it in its former  colonies in the name of maintaining the French-speaking culture.    When French paratroopers landed in Kolwezi, this audacity  was  accepted by the Africans because the gesture was irreproachable.  It was intended to both rescue European nationals and to put a  stop to a subversive operation controlled from outside by the  Cubans. Today, however, there are no expatriates remaining to be  evacuated and the country that stands accused of interfering is  France.    In Europe, the French are exemplary when they take a leading  role, as they did successfully in Bosnia and in the GATT talks.  However, in Africa, they may have to resign themselves to the  fact that rather than accepting a lifeline thrown in from the  outside, the Africans would rather all drown together.</p>

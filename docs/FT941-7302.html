			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Virtual reality heads for the workplace Virtual reality is coming to the workplace. A project called Virtuosi - led by British Telecommunications - aims to create a computer-generated environment in which people can work with each other, wherever they happen to be. Virtuosi will allow users to work in groups from home or in different offices and factories around the world. Two pilot services are being developed. One will improve links between BICC's international cable factories; a 3-D view of the total organisation will appear on a desktop computer screen and users will be able to move round this to find people and information. Video windows and computerised data will be integrated to support conference calls. The other scheme, in Nottinghamshire, will allow textile factories to co-operate in designing and making garments. Remote buyers will be able to see clothes modelled on a 'virtual catwalk'. Division, a UK company, will provide systems enabling people to work in the virtual environment, with BT and GPT (owned by GEC and Siemens) developing the telecommunications aspects.

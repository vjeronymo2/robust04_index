			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: RADIO  </P> <P> All-Led Zeppelin Format: A Florida radio station has switched to what it claims  -- and who would doubt them? -- is the world's only all-Led Zeppelin radio  format. WKRL-FM in Clearwater made the cutover on New Year's Day after spending  New Year's Eve repeatedly playing the 1971 hit "Stairway to Heaven."  </P> <P> Led Zeppelin is "just a very, very strong classic rock group, very prolific and  engaging," said Daniel DiLoreto, manager of WKRL, which until Monday was the  Tampa area's "only classic rock station." The new format is so restrictive that  even solo efforts from members of the now-defunct British band will not be  aired. The group released 10 albums over a 12-year period, and broke up in  December, 1980, after drummer John Bonham died of an alcohol overdose. Shauna  Snow  </P></p>

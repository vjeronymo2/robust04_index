			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): When fact and forecast are polls apart - Guy de Jonquieres says that far more than the professional pride of Britain's psephologists has been dented by the poor showing of their predictions in the general election Market research specialists have long had an advantage over ordinary businessmen. While other executives relied on logic, experience or plain intuition, market researchers could claim they had science and the numbers on their side. Until last Thursday, that is, when Britain's general election result confounded the pollsters' findings. Though political polls are a sideline for the agencies which conduct them - done as much for publicity as for profit - many in market research fear the consequences could be far-reaching. 'There is a grave danger that the whole profession will be called into disrepute,' says Lynne Todd, market information and development manager at Cadbury, Britain's biggest confectionery maker. The Market Research Society, the industry's professional body, evidently shares her concern: it has launched a crash inquiry into what went wrong. Far more than professional pride is involved. Britain's market research industry is among the biggest in Europe, valued at Pounds 425m a year. Just over half of that is accounted for by about 400 market research agencies, which sell their services to corporate and government customers, and the rest by the latters' in-house experts. The industry fears that business may now be harder to come by. No desertions have been reported yet, but some corporate users of market research say last Thursday's debacle has raised doubts about its value. 'We learned long ago to be sceptical when our marketing people say we must launch a product because surveys show consumers would love it,' says the head of a leading UK drinks company. 'We shall be even more sceptical in future.' Ivor Crewe, professor of government at Essex University and a leading psephologist, thinks the pollsters have good reason to be worried. He says they have deliberately turned political polls into an advertisement for their research skills and the benchmark by which they are measured. 'There are very few other occasions when a relatively objective test is available. If market research tells a toothpaste manufacturer that 50 per cent of people prefer green stripes and 30 per cent red stripes, how can the company know if it is true?' he says. Some in the firing line are looking for ways to spread the blame. Bob Worcester, chairman of Mori, whose frequent television appearances have made him Britain's best-known pollster, accuses the media - particularly the broadcasters - of misrepresenting poll findings. 'I've said on virtually every occasion that polls are a snapshot of opinion  -they don't predict,' he says. 'There is no case other than a British general election when we are expected to predict the future and to do so within a decimal point. Only the media expect this.' But other experts think such arguments are a cop-out. Lynne Todd of Cadbury says that after years of working with the media, pollsters should be well aware how their work is presented. Crewe points out that all political pollsters present their eve-of-election findings as forecasts of the outcome and that Worcester has boasted of the accuracy of the opinion polls in foreshadowing past election results. 'Bob really is trying to have it both ways,' says Crewe. Nonetheless, there is widespread agreement that the techniques and use of market research differ between political and business applications. Few, if any, large companies rely on it for forecasting. 'We use it to find out the needs of our customers, what's on their minds,' says Barry Hill, marketing vice-president at American Express. 'We would never ask it to predict whether a particular product would be a success.' Headline statistics and margins of error are also far less critical for business users, many of whom are more interested in longer-run trends. 'It very rarely happens that if the result of a survey is 54 per cent we do one thing, but if it's 55 per cent, we do another,' says Alan Ellerton, market planning manager at the Argos retail chain. Furthermore, though many large companies put much effort into analysing market research findings, none would base an important decision on them. 'Market research is an aid to judgment, not a replacement,' says Bill Young, marketing director of Lever Brothers, the detergents company. Often, he says, more valuable insights can be gained by assessing a new product's performance on foreign markets, studying broader consumer trends, or simply strolling around a supermarket. Young says that some Lever Brothers' products have succeeded even though market research pointed to a poor response. Experts also say opinion surveys for businesses are more tightly structured than political polls, defining target groups, allowing for regional variations, filtering out misleading responses and double-checking results. Sue Stossel, director of the Market Research Society, says this is partly because most business users know precisely which markets they are interested in, while political polls 'are looking at anyone who's got a vote'. But she concedes that cost is also an important factor. Nigel Jacklin of RSL, which carries out the National Readership Survey, says this project involves far more time and money than any market research agency can afford to spend on election polling. Only by joining forces could the political pollsters command resources on that scale. That is an option they may need to consider if they hope to be taken seriously at the next general election. However, judging by the tremors of anxiety coursing through the market research industry, it must act well before then to reassure the business customers on which it depends for its bread and butter.</p>

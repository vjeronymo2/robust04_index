			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The results of a number of polls have  recently appeared in the Portuguese press.  <H5>  Leaders' Popularity Surveyed </H5>   The results of a poll conducted jointly by the Lisbon weekly  O INDEPENDENTE and the Lisbon Catholic University among 1,066  individuals (no further details provided) were published in the  22 April edition of O INDEPENDENTE. Respondents were asked to  rate political leaders on a scale of 1 (worst possible rating)  to 10 (best). Prime Minister Cavaco Silva led the list with 8.2  points, followed by Socialist Party (PS) leader Antonio Guterres  with 7.6, Center Social Democratic Party (CDS) leader Manuel  Monteiro, and Communist Party (PCP) leader Carlos Carvalhas with  5.5. Respondents were also asked to evaluate the government's  actions. Some 7.8 percent thought these were "good," 51.8  percent thought they were "reasonably good," and 37.9 percent  said they were "bad." When rating Cavaco Silva's qualities as  compared with Guterres's, 36.4 percent of the respondents said  the prime minister is "competent," compared with 24.6 percent  who thought so for Guterres. Some 49.4 percent thought Cavaco  Silva is "intelligent," compared with 34.3 percent for Guterres.  The prime minister was also thought more "honest," more  "sincere," more "efficient," and more "cultured" than Guterres,  losing to the PS leader in "tolerance" and "humanism." The prime  minister's popularity, however, has apparently not transferred  to his party, for the poll indicated that if legislative  elections were held at this time, the PS would win with 36.6  percent of the vote, followed by the PSD with 25.8 percent, the  PCP with 6.3 percent, the CDS with 5.6 percent, other parties  with 1 percent, and 24.7 percent undecided. When respondents  were asked their preference for president, former President  Ramalho Eanes and Cavaco Silva were both chosen by 15.9 percent,  followed by Lisbon Mayor Jorge Sampaio with 14.3 percent, Porto  Mayor Fernando Gomes with 10.5 percent, Eurodeputy Lucas Pires  with 6.5 percent, CDS luminary Adriano Moreira with 3.2 percent,  and former PSD Minister Eurico de Melo with 2.8 percent. Some  18.8 percent chose none of them, and 13 percent did not know or  did not answer. The government's actions on the economy were  rated "very bad" and "bad" by 59.1 percent of the respondents,  compared with 3.4 percent who termed them "good" or "very good,"  and 36.4 percent who considered them "reasonably good."  <H5>  Poll on European Parliament Elections </H5>   The 14 April Lisbon weekly VISAO published the results of a  Marktest/VISAO poll conducted between 12 and 30 March in the  Greater Lisbon and Greater Porto areas among 812 individuals,  with a 4.6 percent margin of error. Respondents were asked their  party preference for the 12 June European Parliament elections.  Of the 455 respondents who said they would vote, 47.9 percent  would cast their ballot for the PS, while 28.1 percent would  vote for the PSD. The CDS (11 percent) and the PCP (4.8 percent)  followed. Some 27.3 percent of the respondents did not know if  they would vote.  <H5>  Public Opinion of 25 April Revolution Surveyed </H5>   In view of the forthcoming celebration of the 25 April  revolution that in 1974 freed Portugal from its period of  dictatorship, the 20 April Lisbon daily DIARIO DE NOTICIAS  published the results of a poll (no details provided) in which  respondents were asked to rate political leaders who most  contributed to the democratization and development of Portugal.  Some 33.8 percent chose President Mario Soares. He was followed  by the late Prime Minister Sa Carneiro (15.8 percent), Prime  Minister Cavaco Silva (10.9 percent), former President Ramalho  Eanes (7.6 percent), and former PCP leader Alvaro Cunhal (7.4  percent). Another question focused on whether the goals of  democratization and development of the 25 April revolution have  been achieved. Some 24.4 percent said democratization has been  achieved fully, 46 percent thought it was achieved partially,  9.5 percent said it was not achieved at all, and 20.1 percent  did not know or did not answer. Only 11.4 percent said the  development goal has been achieved, 48.6 percent that it was  partially achieved, 19.2 percent thought it was not achieved,  and 20.9 percent did not know or did not answer.</p>

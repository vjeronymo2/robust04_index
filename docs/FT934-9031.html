			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): To catch a thief When many burglar alarms ring it is just as likely to be the local cat as a felon that sets them off. However, the latest camera-on-a-microchip could help the owners of the premises to verify the presence of the thief before the police are called. Once the alarm sounds the mini camera transmits video images of the break-in (or false alarm) down a telephone line to a control centre. The TVX camera, developed by Edinburgh University and TVX International, of Hemel Hempstead, costs a quarter of the price of traditional video surveillance systems and can be added to existing alarm systems.

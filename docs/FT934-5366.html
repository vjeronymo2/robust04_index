			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Keeping an eye on the ratings - Michael Smith on how the City evaluates the electricity companies Eastern Electricity today opens the interim results season of the 12 regional electricity companies in perhaps a rather more relaxed mood than that to which it is accustomed when reporting to the City. On previous occasions it has been among the lowest rated of the recs, but in recent months its shares have moved ahead strongly as investors have re-examined its prospects. Three years after the regional electricity companies of England and Wales were floated, Eastern's improved fortunes highlight the way the City evaluates in a sector where each of the companies is remarkably similar. How do analysts judge the companies, and do differentials between the various companies' share prices matter? In most sectors the danger of a low stock market rating is that it increases the chances of a company being subjected to a hostile takeover bid. The government's ownership of a golden share in each of the 12 recs makes that less of a consideration in electricity. Even after 1995, when the golden share expires, few analysts expect contested take-overs in the sector, in part because the differential in the ratings, whether measured in prospective yields or price/earnings ratios, is relatively small when compared to other sectors, including water. However Mr Nigel Hawkins, an analyst at Hoare Govett, is among those who believe that agreed mergers are more likely. The stronger a company's share price, the stronger its bargaining position would be in merger talks. Mr Nigel Burton, electricity analyst at SG Warburg Securities, says there are two other motives for the rec executives to keep their ratings high. 'The first is that high share prices act as an incentive on staff. 'Most recs' employees look regularly at their company's share price and see how it is faring against others in the sector. 'The executives' second motive in keeping their rating high is their pride.' If Mr Burton is right, the pride of Mr John Harris, chairman of East Midlands Electricity, must have taken a fair knocking in the past three years. East Midlands has never been highly rated since its flotation and yesterday was no exception. Its shares were, at yesterday's closing price of 561p, the lowest of the recs, all of which were floated at 240p. But what signifies its low valuation in City eyes is its prospective yield for the current year. If Warburg is right in its prediction that the company will pay out 22p to shareholders in 1993-94 the prospective yield is 4.9 per cent. This, again, is among the highest of the recs, signifying the City's relatively poor view of the company. On Warburg's analysis Norweb was sitting on the top of the rec pile at noon yesterday, with its shares trading at a prospective yield of 4.4 per cent. In evaluating electricity shares investors are strongly influenced by their perceptions of the managements and their strategies. One reason why Eastern has climbed from the bottom of the heap is that it last year appointed Mr John Devaney as chief executive. Prior to his arrival there had been concern that Mr James Smith, now chairman but then chief executive as well, was not doing enough to improve the company's efficiency and the City felt staff numbers remained stubbornly high. Mr Devaney, whose previous job was in the US motor industry, is credited with implementing significant job cuts and improved efficiencies in the past year. At East Midlands, Mr John Harris, chairman, is considered by some potential investors to take too high a profile. While other rec chiefs kept their heads down during the national debate over coal last year and this, Mr Harris could often be seen on television putting forward the industry's case. The City prefers the quieter, more cautious approach of someone like Mr Ken Harvey, chairman of Norweb. One analyst relates how he recently visited a small institution for the first time in six years. 'Ken had been there the week before. The personal touch can make all the difference.' But however personable a company chief is, he has to have a convincing story to sell if a round of City visits is to pay off. Here again, investors have been sceptical about East Midlands' diversification into areas such as electrical contracting. They tend to prefer the stick-to-basics approach of Manweb, the only one of the 12 recs that has not participated in joint ventures to set up combined cycle gas generating plants. Mr Simon Williams, electricity analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities, says Manweb's shares are among the most attractive in the sector because they have the lowest risk strategy. This, he says, is also reflected in its drive to improve efficiency. 'The only way to consistently beat the regulator is to cut costs and Manweb has consistently demonstrated it can do that.' In the coming months controllable costs will come increasingly to the fore. This year's interim results will be treated with relative caution by investors who are wary of drawing too many conclusions from a half year which contributes far less than half of annual profits. The focus will be on how the company can present itself to the regulator as he prepares his review of the companies' distribution businesses. Distribution is where the recs make most of their money; if companies show they have done as much as they can to make them efficient they may suffer least in the review and, therefore, in their share price.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   THE REGIONAL ELECTRICITY COMPANIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company          Pre-tax            Dividend     Gross yield on first                  profits (poundsm)  per share(p)  1994 dividend (%)                  1994    1993       1993-94       1992-93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Eastern          229     183        21.9          19.2         4.66 East Midlands    184     155        22.0          19.5         4.80 London           186     146        22.1          19.5         4.77 Manweb           126     111        23.9          21.0         4.69 Midlands         193     167        22.6          20.0         4.65 Northern         122     111        24.5          21.5         4.91 Norweb           158     157        22.5          20.0         4.42 Seeboard         125     113        22.8          20.0         4.43 Southern         214     187        22.4          19.6         4.65 South Western    112     101        22.7          20.0         4.80 Swalec           103      87        25.4          22.3         4.95 Yorkshire        172     156        23.4          20.4         4.73  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

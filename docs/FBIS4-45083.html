			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Basheer Hussain: "GATT Accord and the Indian </F> Constitution; No Real Role for Parliament"]    [Text] The Opposition parties have been demanding that the  GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) accord should be  ratified by the Parliament. Union Commerce Minister Pranab  Mukherjee, addressing a meeting of the Congressmen at  Bhubaneswar on April 24, said: "The Union Council of Ministers  is fully empowered to take a decision under the Indian  Constitution where Parliament has no role."    He further said: "Scores of treaties and agreements had been  signed by India in the past after being approved by the Council  of Ministers and no one has ever raised the question as to why  it was not debated in Parliament," and added "Articles 73(b) and  253 fully empower the Cabinet to take such decisions."  <H5>  Provisions </H5>   In view of this controversy, it is pertinent to examine the  relevant provisions of the Constitution. The following are the  provisions relating to conclusion and enforcement of treaties in  the Indian Constitution: Articles 51(c), 73(b), 253 and Entry 14  of List I in the Seventh Schedule.    Art. 51(c) is the Directive Principle of State Policy and it  urges the State to endeavour to foster respect for international  law and treaty obligations. Art. 73(b) states that the executive  power of the Indian Union is exercisable without prior  legislation to enforce the provisions of a treaty provided it  does not conflict with the provisions of the Constitution. Art.  253 gives power to Parliament to make laws even encroaching upon  the State subjects enumerated in the State List II of the  Seventh Schedule for implementing a treaty.    In other words, what Parliament by itself cannot do, it can  do, aided by a treaty. Finally Entry 14 of the List I of the  Seventh Schedule confers on the Union Government exclusive power  to conclude treaties with foreign countries.    To understand the implications of the constitutional  provisions relating to treaty, one has to know the British  Common Law practice and the attitude of the Indian judiciary.  British Common Law is in force in India by virtue of Art. 272.  For instance, the personal laws of Muslims and Hindus, and the  Law of Torts are part of British Common Law.    According to Common Law practice it is the royal prerogative  to make a treaty. But if the treaty were to alter the internal  law either by conferring rights on individuals or depriving  individuals of their rights which they enjoy under the domestic  law, that treaty requires legislation by parliament. It is known  as enabling act. It means unless Parliament by appropriate  legislation incorporates the provisions of a treaty into its  domestic law (Municipal Law) it does not become part of English  Law.  <H5>  Executive Act </H5>   The reason why the enabling act of Parliament is required to  enforce a treaty internally is, that the conclusion of a treaty  is an executive act. Neither Houses of Parliament participate in  the treaty-making process. If the treaty were to be enforced  internally without the enabling act of Parliament, it amounts to  the executive being empowered to legislate. This may be  dangerous. The British practice is that the enabling act is  passed by parliament before the treaty is ratified.    There is also a practice called the Ponsonby Rule. Under  this  Rule, a treaty is laid before Parliament 21 days prior to  ratification and publication in the United Kingdom Treaty  Series. However this is not a legal requirement.  <H5>  In America </H5>   Under the United States Constitution, the President has the  "Power by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to make  treaties provided two-thirds of the Senators present concur"  (Art. 6).    As the US Senate, one of the houses of the legislature,  participates in the treaty-making process, "all treaties which  shall be made under the Authority of the US shall be the supreme  law of the land" (Art. 6). An enabling act to enforce a treaty  internally is not required.    The courts in India follow the British practice. The  President of India like the Queen in England is competent to  make a treaty. If a treaty were to affect the rights of a  citizen, it has to be supported by legislation.    In Maganbhai vs Union of India (1969, SC). The Supreme Court  said: "If as a consequence of the exercise of executive power,  the rights of citizens or others are restricted or infringed or  laws are modified, the exercise must be supported by  legislation, when there is no such restriction, infringement of  the right or modification of the laws, the executive is  competent to exercise power."    Besides infringement of rights, legislation is also required  to give effect to a treaty which provides for payment of money  to a foreign power which must be drawn from the Consolidated  Funds of India (Moti Lal vs Uttar Pradesh, 1961 Allahabad High  Court).    However, an amendment to the Constitution is necessary to  cede Indian territory to a foreign State (re. Berubari Union of  India, 1960 Supreme Court).    But neither an amendment to the Constitution nor legislation  is necessary for an agreement with a foreign State to refer a  boundary dispute to an international tribunal or to implement  the award of the tribunal. Changes in the boundary line can be  done by executive following the award. Boundary settlements or  the awards of tribunals should be recognised by the courts of  our country (Maganbhai vs Union of India).    The GATT accord does not, in any way, infringe the legal  rights of an Indian citizen. If the Government of India had felt  that GATT would infringe or modify the rights of the citizens it  would have introduced appropriate legislation in Parliament to  bring the Indian laws in accordance with the provisions of GATT  before ratification.  <H5>  Assumption </H5>   It should be noted that Article 27 of the Vienna Convention  on the Law of Treaties stipulates: "A party may not invoke the  provisions of its internal law as a justification for its  failure to perform a treaty." A country cannot legislate out of  international law. The courts while, giving effect to the  provisions of treaty internally, should presume that it was not  the intention of the executive or parliament to violate the law  of the land.</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Gilts auction boosts equities to new peak levels - Market Report Institutional buyers flooded back into the London equity market yesterday, driving the FT-SE 100 Index ahead by just over 40 points to an all-time closing high. Tumbling bond yields, following the successful outcome of the auction of Pounds 3bn worth of government securities, provided a fresh boost to the argument for buying UK equities, and London also joined in the rise in European bourses that reflected hopes that the Uruguay Round of trade talks are close to accord. The Footsie ended at 3,277.4, a gain of 40.1 points, having touched a new intraday peak of 3,279.5. The lead came, once again, from the stock index futures, where the December contract challenged the 3,300 mark as both marketmakers and investors struggled to position themselves ahead of a fast-rising stock market. Confidence that UK base rates will be cut again very soon strengthened following the gilt-edged auction, and was fuelled by similar expectations across Europe. Traders said that buying of UK equities came from across the range of global investment centres, and also from domestic funds. One dealer estimated buying orders to selling orders at 10 to one over the past week. The stock market closed on a note of optimism as sterling improved and there were reports that the Governor of the Bank of England had expressed optimism on prospects for base rates and for domestic inflation. The rush of buyers increased the pressures on London marketmakers, already very short of stock in both equity and futures markets. For most of the session, the futures contract was at a premium of more than 20 points against, a highly unusual development when the contract has only a short time left to run. The most powerful advance came in bank share prices as renewed optimism on the dividend outlook buttressed views that falling interest rates will work wonders for loan books. The rest of the financial sector was also in strong form, as were property stocks. Utility stocks also performed strongly on expectations of dividend growth. Store and consumer issues, however, traded less aggressively since base rate hopes have already been taken into prices. Blue chip internationals were firmer, with the exception of the oil majors which struggled to hold on to early gains against the background of disappointing crude oil prices. Demand across the full range of the market brought a further advance in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which closed 21.9 up at a new peak of 3,589.9. Seaq volume jumped from 689.7m shares on Tuesday to 821.4m yesterday; on the session following the Budget Speech, Seaq volume totalled more than 1.2bn shares. High levels of retail, or customer, business have continued this week, bringing a value figure of Pounds 1.44bn for Tuesday's session. Traders identified renewed demand for UK equities by some of the large New York investment banks and securities houses, which had appeared to back away slightly from London since the turn of the month. The following changes to the FT-SE 100 Share Index have been approved by the FT-SE Actuaries UK Indices Committee. For inclusion; Eastern Electricity, Scottish Hydro-Electric. For exclusion; Northern Foods, NFC. Details on UK Companies pages.</p>

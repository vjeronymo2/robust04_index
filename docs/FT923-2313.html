			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Output standstill hits hopes for recovery HOPES that British industry might be recovering from the recession were dampened yesterday by news that manufacturing output was unchanged in July. Official figures showed that the output of manufactured goods in the three months to the end of July was flat compared with the previous three months and 0.9 per cent lower than the same period a year ago. In July, the level of output was the same as in June. The figures suggested that a small rise in manufacturing production in the first half of the year - which led some economists to suggest that manufacturing industry had seen the worst of the recession - petered out during the summer. Manufacturing output rose 0.3 per cent in the first quarter of this year and 0.5 per cent in the second quarter after six consecutive quarters of falling production. Overall industrial production, which includes oil and gas output, grew 1 per cent in July. That was due to a sharp increase in energy production. The Central Statistical Office figures showed that output for most sectors of manufacturing fell slightly or was flat during the three months to the end of July. Food, drink and tobacco output grew by 1 per cent compared with the previous three months, while output of the minerals, engineering, textiles and clothing sectors was almost unchanged.</p>

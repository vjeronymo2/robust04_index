			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Economic Watch: German wholesale setback German wholesalers saw turnover in July fall to DM78bn (Pounds 32bn), a real 4 per cent lower than during the same period last year, according to figures released by the federal statistics office, belying other statistics which suggest that Germany's recovery is gathering pace. In nominal terms, including seasonal factors, the sales figure fell by 1 per cent. Wholesale turnover in the first seven months of this year totalled DM567bn, nominally 1 per cent higher than the very low levels last year when the country was feeling the full force of its worst post-war recession, and flat in real terms. Analysts have suggested that the poor wholesale figures reflect higher demand for investment goods and exports as the economy recovers. High unemployment and a zero wage round have dampened consumer demand so far this year. Spain's official currency reserves rose by Dollars 89.50m in August from July, according to provisional figures released by the Bank of Spain yesterday. The official reserves stood at Dollars 44.85bn as of August 31, the central bank said.</p>

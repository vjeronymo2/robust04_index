			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Genoa (6) - Symbol of lost opportunities / The Harbour, The flag of privatisation is now flying highest at the port - surprisingly, for a former centre of hard-left politics IN A CITY renowned for its reserve, nothing provokes an argument faster than the port. For its critics, the port symbolises decades of politicised management, bungling and lost opportunities, notably in failing to come to terms with containerisation. Added to that has been a reluctance to confront restrictive labour practices, which led to high costs and an inevitable downward spiral of lower competitiveness and steady decline. From 51m tonnes in 1980, cargo handled fell to 44m last year, including oil and related products, which comprised more than half the overall tonnage in 1991. Meanwhile, the number of dockers has dropped to just over 1,000 from more than 7,000 15 years ago. To some extent, the argument has already been won. Even the port's management, concentrated in the 13th Century Palazzo San Giorgio, admits Genoa must adapt or die. What they add is that change is already well under way. Surprisingly for a former centre of hard-left politics, it is at the port that the flag of privatisation is now flying highest. Under plans originally drawn up in 1984, and subsequently refined, the Port Authority is bringing in private companies as partners in a number of joint ventures within the traditional port area. Meanwhile, at Voltri, six miles to the west, a L180bn scheme is under way to build the biggest container terminal in the Mediterranean, with the Port Authority as only a junior partner to private sector capital. The Port Authority has singled out seven activities in the old port in which it wants private-sector participation, explains Mr Rinaldo Magnani, a former dock worker and ex-president of Liguria, who is now its chairman. The terminals include fruit, general bulk cargoes, fertilisers and roll-on roll-off transport. The most likely private sector shareholders will be the big companies already using the facilities, he explains. So far, Coeclerici, a leading trader and fruit importer, has joined forces with the Port Authority at the fruit terminal, Ferruzzi and two other private companies are participating on the ro-ro side, while the Camelli group has come in for bulk cargoes. 'We're trying out a concept which could eventually be applied to other Italian ports too,' says Mr Magnani. Sceptics say the decision to turn to private companies has come more out of desperation than desire given the sorry state of the port's finances and the financial pressures on the Rome government, which has been so generous towards Genoa in the past. Much of the expected L300bn investment in the terminals is supposed to come from the private sector. The biggest single investment - some L75bn - is going on the cruise and ferry terminal, while L20.5bn is earmarked for the specialised bulk cargo terminal and L47.5bn for ro-ro. If the scheme for the terminals is ambitious, that for Voltri is bigger still. Here, the Port Authority has joined forces with Fiat - a traditional bogey of the hard left in Italy. Together, they have set up a new company, Voltri Terminal Europa (VTE), in which Sinport, a subsidiary of Fiat's Cogefar-Impresit civil engineering arm, has 95 per cent of the shares and the port the rest. Significantly, overall management will be left to Sinport, which has been given the concession to run Voltri from the Port Authority, which controls the land. When it opens next year, Voltri, covering more than 1m square metres, will be able to handle three 'jumbo' container ships simultaneously. Volume in the first year is forecast to reach 100,000 containers, rising to 250,000 in 1995 and 500,000 by the year 2000. But ambitions for Voltri do not end there. Mr Magnani says the eventual aim may be to float VTE on the stock market, while other big industrial shareholders may also be brought in. Such partners could include leading Far East shipping groups, such as Evergreen, say local industry sources. Negotiating long-term contracts with big Far Eastern shipping companies is part of the Port Authority's strategy. 'I know there's a lot of interest,' Mr Magnani says. He wants the new facility to become a 'point of reference' in the Mediterranean, especially given Europe's steadily rising level of imports from the Far East. The Port Authority plays on Genoa's proximity to Europe's main markets, which can be reached easily via the adjoining motorway and rail network. By offloading at Voltri, shippers from the Pacific, sailing via the Suez canal, would save about a week's journey time compared with using established container terminals in northern Europe such as Rotterdam. In spite of having recently returned from an extensive Far Eastern marketing trip, Mr Magnani will not comment on how close Voltri has come to signing long-term contracts with big 'round-the-world' shipping groups. Nor will he reveal whether such companies might become future shareholders in VTE. However, he draws attention to the fact that a canny group like Fiat is unlikely to have commited so much money to Voltri if it were unsure about the outcome. Mr Magnani admits Voltri may take some business away from the port's two existing container terminals. However, he notes the facilities are complementary rather than competitive. Voltri will be able to berth appreciably bigger ships than can dock in Genoa now. He also points to the growth of 5-6 per cent a year forecast for Mediterranean traffic. So, while the old port may lose some business, it should remain busy, he claims. More important, the lower costs of using Voltri thanks to deregulated labour could provide a salutary stimulus for altered working practices among the port's existing dockers. Surprisingly, Mr Magnani is reticent when it comes to assessing the effect of Voltri on Marseilles and Barcelona, the two other big container facilities in the western Mediterranean with which it will compete. 'I don't say we should be competing with them. Rather, we should be winning back the business that now goes from Milan to Rotterdam, instead of coming to Genoa,' he says. But will Genoa, still bearing the stigma of rotten industrial relations for many shippers, be able to rise to the new challenges? For many Genoese businessmen, the port's conversion to the cause of privatisation is hard to swallow. Mr Riccardo Garrone, the chairman of the ERG petroleum group and a leader of the city's business community, responds with scepticism mixed with hope. His doubts are largely based on the way in which the port has been run in the past. 'The wrong people were in charge. When motorways were being built all over Europe, making other, more reliable, ports competitive in spite of being further away from the main markets, Genoa failed to react.' The port has undoubtedly lost ground. La Spezia to the south now handles appreciably more containers, although it is less conveniently placed for the big cities of northern Italy. Even smaller ports such as Savona have gained at Genoa's expense. Mr Garrone focuses on the lack of internal competition and transparency as the port's biggest problems in the past. Though showered with government money, the cash went to cover the losses caused by its myriad inefficiencies rather than being ploughed into investments for the future. Meanwhile, the regular doses of state funds cushioned dockers and even businesses connected with the port from feeling the harsh winds of competition, he thinks. Mr Garrone hopes that part-privatisation and the development of Voltri will mark a new chapter. But he warns that they will only succeed if there is genuine competition between port operators. For Mr Garrone, one of the gravest mistakes of the past was that the port was run by a single, largely unaccountable entity. Privatisation is definitely 'a step ahead. But there must true competition' if the schemes are to succeed, he stresses.</p>

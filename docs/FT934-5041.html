			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Airport duty from October A new excise duty is to be imposed on air travel from UK airports. From 1 October 1994, passengers will be charged Pounds 5 for flights to UK and other European Union destinations and Pounds 10 elsewhere. The duty will be collected from passengers by airlines. Children under two who travel free will be exempt and so will passengers on the return leg of a journey within the UK on a return ticket. There will also be exemptions for transit and transfer passengers and for passengers on small aircraft such as those used for Scottish inter-island services. The duty will be collected from airlines on the basis of the number of passengers carried. It is expected that airlines will add the duty to their ticket prices. The revenue yield is estimated to be around Pounds 115m in 1994-95 rising to Pounds 330m in 1995-96 and Pounds 355m in 1996-97.</p>

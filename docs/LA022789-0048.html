			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINESE BAR DISSIDENT FROM PRESIDENT'S FAREWELL BANQUET  </P> <P> President Bush reaffirmed ties of Sino-U.S. friendship in wide-ranging  discussions with China's top leaders Sunday, but his visit was marred when  Chinese security agents blocked the country's most prominent dissident from  attending a Bush-hosted banquet.  </P> <P> Astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, who was expelled from the Communist Party in early  1987 for allegedly instigating pro-democracy student demonstrations, was among  500 guests -- including President Yang Shangkun and Premier Li Peng -- who were  invited to the Texas-style barbecue banquet at the Great Wall Sheraton Hotel.  </P> <P> Chinese police and security agents, however, physically prevented Fang and his  wife from attending, Fang said early today.  </P> <P> As Bush flew from Beijing to Seoul aboard Air Force One this morning, White  House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that the President "expressed  his regret" about the Fang "incident" to Vice Premier Wu Xueqian, the ranking  Chinese official bidding farewell to Bush at the Beijing airport. Fitzwater  said he did not know Wu's response.  </P> <P> The spokesman said Bush also asked U.S. Ambassador Winston Lord to determine  the details of the incident.  </P> <P> Fitzwater also disclosed that the President reported he raised the human rights  issue privately in his meetings in China and that Secretary of State James A.  Baker III did likewise.  </P> <P> However, he as much as acknowledged that the United States was putting primary  emphasis on economic reform in China over political reform.  </P> <P> The U.S. approach, he said, "was to focus on economic reforms and, to a degree,  political reforms. But economic reforms first, and that's where the primary  areas of progress have been made."  </P> <P> In a written statement distributed after Bush reached Seoul, Fitzwater made  only passing reference to human rights, saying, "We hope for more progress."  </P> <P> The statement said Bush felt the trip was successful and cited the interest in  both nations on moving ahead on such issues as two-way trade, the developing  military relationship, and the flow of Chinese students to the United States.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bush Sees Deng, Zhao  </P> <P> Earlier Sunday, Bush discussed a host of international and bilateral issues in  separate meetings with Premier Li, Communist Party General Secretary Zhao  Ziyang, and China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.  </P> <P> His talks with Deng focused on issues related to the warming trend in  Sino-Soviet relations, while Zhao outlined the relationship of political and  economic issues in China's reforms, according to White House officials.  </P> <P> Li and Bush discussed Taiwan, Cambodia, the Philippines, the Korean Peninsula,  the Middle East, terrorism, Chinese reforms, trade and East-West relations,  White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. That meeting touched specifically  on the issue of Chinese missile sales, Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> Bush's hourlong meeting with Deng "centered almost entirely on Sino-Soviet  relations," Fitzwater said at a press briefing.  </P> <P> Previously tense relations between China and the Soviet Union have shown rapid  improvement over the last year. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is  scheduled to visit Beijing in mid-May to meet Deng in the first Sino-Soviet  summit since 1959.  </P> <P> Bush opened his discussion with Deng "by saying that we welcomed the meeting  between the president of the Soviet Union and Chairman Deng Xiaoping, that we  saw it as an important and useful step in providing stability to the region as  well as the world," Fitzwater said. "He wanted to assure the chairman that  United States policy with regard to China would not be affected by the outcome  of those discussions -- that the Sino-United States relationship is strong and  is an evolving one, and that he wished the chairman well in those discussions."  </P> <P> Premier Li repeated previous assurances -- first given last September to  then-Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci -- that China will show restraint in  future sales of missiles to other countries. Chinese sales of  intermediate-range ballistic missiles to Saudi Arabia and anti-ship Silkworm  missiles to Iran have been a key divisive issue in U.S.-China relations.  </P> <P> On Sunday, Fitzwater apparently revealed more than he was supposed to about the  nature of those assurances.  </P> <P> "The President raised our concerns about missile proliferation," Fitzwater said  at the briefing. "The premier recalled Deng Xiaoping's statement to former  Defense Secretary Carlucci that China would not sell missiles to countries  other than Saudi Arabia. The premier reaffirmed that commitment."  </P> <P> A few hours later, deputy White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk sought to  retract Fitzwater's statement, describing it as "incorrect." Popadiuk declined,  however, to give details on what Li said.  </P> <P> On the subject of Taiwan -- which Beijing has viewed as a breakaway province  ever since China's former Nationalist Party government took refuge there in  1949 after its defeat by the Communists on the Chinese mainland -- Bush  reaffirmed that the United States is "committed to a one-China policy,"  Fitzwater said. Bush restated the American position that the future of the  island should be worked out by the Chinese themselves, both those on Taiwan and  on the mainland.  </P> <P> The evening banquet featured barbecued brisket, sausage and chicken, potato  salad, cole slaw, baked beans, pecan pie, peach cobbler and vanilla ice cream.  A U.S. Navy band played country-western music and there were words of  friendship.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Great Potential'  </P> <P> "I have emerged from these talks convinced that U.S.-China relations are  strong," Bush said in a banquet toast. "There is also great potential for  further development."  </P> <P> Dissident scientist Fang, however, never reached the banquet hall.  </P> <P> Shortly after midnight Sunday, Fang and a friend who had set off with him to  the banquet, UCLA Prof. Perry Link, director of the U.S. Academy of Sciences  office in Beijing, appeared at the press room set up in another hotel for  reporters covering Bush's visit. At an impromptu news conference, Fang related  in slightly broken English what had happened.  </P> <P> Fang said that he and Link and their wives were riding in a car to the banquet  when police stopped them not too far from the hotel. Chinese security officers  told Fang that he and his wife, Beijing University physics professor Li  Shuxian, could not attend the banquet, Fang said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Even Taxi Was Stopped  </P> <P> The couples then tried to take a taxi to the U.S. Embassy, and the taxi was  stopped. They walked to the American ambassador's residence but were stopped  outside by Chinese guards, Fang said. They later went to a Canadian diplomat's  home, and finally got in touch with American officials only as the banquet was  ending, Fang and Link said. Link heads an American academic office in Beijing.  </P> <P> Fang expanded on his thoughts in an interview conducted in Chinese. He said  that if Bush had intended to make a point about human rights by inviting him to  the banquet, but wanted at the same time to avoid raising the subject directly  with Chinese leaders, then this "is not very smart."  </P> <P> General Secretary Zhao sharply told the President on Sunday that advocates of  "the multi-party politics and parliamentary politics of Western countries" are  a threat to China's market-oriented reforms and that their American supporters  are no friends of China.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Stirring Up Disorder'  </P> <P> "The role they play in practical life is not to promote reform, but to provide  a pretext for rolling back reform and stirring up social disorder," Zhao said,  according to Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing, who spoke at a Sunday  evening press conference.  </P> <P> "We do not export our system to other countries, nor do we copy the systems of  other countries," Zhao added, according to Li.  </P> <P> "The fact that some personages in American society support those people who are  dissatisfied with the Chinese government will not contribute to the stability  of China's political situation and the carrying out of China's reforms, nor  will it be conducive to the friendship between China and the United States,"  Zhao added.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Warning From Premier  </P> <P> Premier Li issued a similar warning to Bush. "The Chinese premier . . . pointed  out that a few Americans are attempting to influence China's policies on this  issue or that, and interfere in China's internal affairs," the official New  China News Agency reported.  </P></p>

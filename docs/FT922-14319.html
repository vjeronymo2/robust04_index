			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Blacks in Liverpool may become 'underclass' ETHNIC groups in Liverpool are not even on the verge of equal opportunity, according to a Liverpool University study of young black people in the city, Alan Pike writes. Future generations of black people are, the report says, balanced between remaining in touch with mainstream society or becoming 'a class decisively apart and eventually an underclass'. The study, by Professor Kenneth Roberts, professor of sociology at Liverpool, and other members of the university's sociology and social policy department, contests the idea that 'Britain's racial divisions will slacken away, given time, as immigrant minorities become culturally assimilated and the white majority grow accustomed to citizens with different skin colours'. A study of youngsters aged 16 to 19, the report says, made 'crystal clear' that young black people were not obtaining equal labour market rewards even with the same qualifications as whites.</p>

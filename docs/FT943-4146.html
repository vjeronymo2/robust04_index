			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Parsons to cut 600 jobs after contracts delay Parsons Power Generation Systems, part of the Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group, yesterday announced the loss of 400 jobs because of a shortage of work. Most of the losses will be at its Heaton base in Newcastle upon Tyne. In addition Parsons is shedding 200 temporary jobs at Heaton, where manufacturing work on existing export contracts will finish next summer. Last November the company won three power-station projects in India totalling Pounds 660m. Parsons was to be the turnkey contractor - with overall responsibility for all three projects - and was also to manufacture five turbine generators for the projects. But the contracts, placed by independent Indian power producers, depended on the negotiation of financial packages which have taken much longer than expected to complete. The delay on the contracts, which Parsons still hopes to carry out, has combined with tough competition for orders. Mr Trevor Murch, Parsons managing director, said the company faced a change in the nature of its customers from 'state-owned, monolithic utility generators' towards independent power producers. 'For projects run by an entrepreneur there's a complete funding package we need to put together,' he said. 'These things take a little while.' Parsons, which has made steam turbine generators at Heaton since 1889, has recently developed a new role as a turnkey contractor, responsible for projects incorporating equipment from other Rolls-Royce companies and its alliance partner, US-based Westinghouse. Mr Murch said the role was in addition to Parsons' manufacturing activities. Parsons stressed it was making 'strenuous efforts' to boost its orders, and was continuing investment in product development and new equipment and systems. The across-the-board job cuts, affecting 360 at Heaton and 40 service jobs elsewhere, will cut Parsons' payroll to 2,100 in Newcastle and to 2,500 in total. Mr Barney McGill, spokesman for the unions, described the job losses as devastating but hoped negotiation, and possibly orders, during the 90-day consultation period would reduce the numbers. Parsons is Tyneside's largest manufacturing employer following the rundown of shipbuilder Swan Hunter. Mr Nick Brown, Labour MP for Newcastle East, yesterday wrote to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, saying this had been a 'disastrous week' for the area's industrial base and urging him to offer constructive support for Parsons' export drive. Redundancies at Parsons could be averted, he said yesterday. 'We need a prompt response from government offering help with key overseas orders. Michael Heseltine should intervene now - as his French, German, American and Japanese counterparts would.'</p>

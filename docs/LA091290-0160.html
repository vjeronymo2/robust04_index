			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> TOKYO TO CONSIDER THIRD WORLD  </P> <P> Japan has set up a study panel to seek ways to encourage private sector  investment in Third World nations, officials said today.  </P> <P> "The panel's study will help complement Japan's drive to recyle its huge trade  surplus into developing nations," a Finance Ministry official told reporters.  </P> <P> Ministry officials said the panel is scheduled to come up with recommendations  to the government in about a year.  </P> <P> They said Japan needs to find measures to help redirect the flow of Japanese  capital because most private-sector funds have so far flowed to industrial  nations.  </P> <P> Of Japan's $67.54 billion in direct investment abroad in the last fiscal year,  48.2% went to the United States and 20.8% went to nations in the European  Community.  </P></p>

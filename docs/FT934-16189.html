			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / International Company News: Coca-Cola unit in bottle deal COCA-COLA Amatil, the stock market listed Australian snacks and beverage group in which Atlanta-based Coca-Cola holds a majority stake, plans to acquire control of an Indonesian bottling company, P. T. Djaya Beverage Bottling. It is paying about USDollars 46m. DBBC is the Coca-Cola franchise bottler for Jakarta and adjacent parts of the Jakarta metropolitan area, one of the most heavily populated and prosperous centres in the region, and has about 30 per cent of Coca-Cola system sales in Indonesia. CCA already owns 49 per cent interests in two other Indonesian joint venture bottling companies - Pan Java and Tirtalina - with about half the system sales. CCA will acquire DBBC in exchange for shares. The majority shareholder in DBBC is Indonesian Bottlers (IBL), which will receive 5.88m shares in CCA. The two minority shareholders are Coca-Cola Holdings (Asia), which has a 29 per cent interest and Mikuni Coca-Cola Bottling Company with about 20 per cent. At current stock market prices for CCA and ruling exchange rates, they are expected to receive about 1.6m shares and 1.1m shares respectively. The deal is subject to various regulatory approvals. Assuming it is completed as planned, the interest held by Coca-Cola in the US in Coca-Cola Amatil will be slightly diluted, but will remain above the 50 per cent level. CCA shares rose slightly yesterday, to ADollars 8.60. Amcor, the paper and packaging group, expects that the ADollars 415m (USDollars 276m) acquisition of Associated Pulp and Paper Mills, the pulp and paper arm of North Broken Hill Peko, will improve both its overall profits and its earnings per share. Amcor said the purchase should be completed at the end of this month.</p>

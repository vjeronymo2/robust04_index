These fears were mentioned today by Zang Chunzheng, from the  Chinese Foreign Trade Ministry, with reference to the thirteenth  meeting between China and the European Union to begin Monday [28  February] with the participation of Commissioner Leon Brittan.    Zang Chunzheng said he hoped the meeting would remove or  weaken "the quotas and other limitations introduced by the  Twelve". He described them as "discriminatory measures adopted  to protect the European market against China".    China's re-admission into GATT, the international commerce  agreement, will be one of the issues examined during Brittan's  visit.</p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / US data boost Clinton outlook THE Clinton administration will inherit the best inflation outlook for a generation, according to figures released yesterday, writes Michael Prowse in Washington. Data on production and exports, however, confirmed that the pace of recovery is likely to remain subdued. Consumer prices rose 0.1 per cent last month and by 2.9 per cent in the year to December. With the exception of a temporary dip in inflation below 2 per cent in 1986, this was the lowest annual increase since the mid-1960s. Bonus for Clinton, Page 3 Wall Street report, Page 19</p>

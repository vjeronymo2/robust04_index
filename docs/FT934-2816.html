			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / International Company News: Renault and Volvo re-examine alliance Renault and Volvo have agreed to examine their alliance on a case-by-case basis following the collapse of their planned merger. They will also continue to collaborate, but only in areas of mutual advantage, according to Mr Louis Schweitzer, chairman of the French car group. In an interview with the news service Agence France Press, Mr Schweitzer said he had met Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo's chief executive, in Paris earlier this week to discuss the future of their companies' relationship. The Renault chairman said they had agreed to preserve activities which remained in the companies' common interest and which maintained the autonomy of their operations. Other joint activities included in their far-reaching alliance, which was formed in 1990, will be stopped. Mr Schweitzer named a number of projects which had been jeopardised by the failure of the merger. These included the P4 project to develop a range of executive cars, and joint purchasing arrangements, regarded as one of the principal means of cutting costs as a merged group. Areas where co-operation is expected to continue include the exchange of components. Renault said it was likely to go ahead with plans to source engines from the Swedish car manufacturer for use in the Renault Laguna, a replacement for the Renault 21 to be introduced next year. A number of grey areas remain. One of these is the creation of joint dispatch centres in the UK, where cars are held before being shipped to distributors. Renault said the two companies would discuss the future of these centres. Renault described the talks as constructive, and said the two sides agreed on the need to move from 'the dynamic of a merger' to 'a logic of free co-operation'. Mr Schweitzer said this co-operation meant holding on to the cross-shareholdings established between the two groups.</p>

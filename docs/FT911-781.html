			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Private radio and TV to return in Malta MALTA is to have private radio and television broadcasting after a gap of 16 years under legislation approved by parliament this week. The legislation sanctions the creation of 10 radio stations, a television cable operation and several non-profit-making community radios. Radio and television stations were nationalised by the former socialist premier, Mr Dom Mintoff, in 1975. Radio and tv broadcasting has become increasingly politicised, with ministers using flimsy excuses to appear nightly on television news bulletins. The spawning of privately owned radio stations may, however, do little to defuse the Maltese passion for politics. Barely had the broadcasting act made its way through parliament and Mr Eddie Fenech Adami, the prime minister, had licensed his own ruling Nationalist party, the opposition Labour party and the island's conservative Roman Catholic church to set up their own radio stations. There are suspicions that the liberalisation of broadcasting is in fact designed to give political parties new weapons with which to wage battle as the 1993 general election approaches. These suspicions are fuelled by the government's decision to grant the church a radio licence. The church in Malta is largely viewed as a traditional foe of the Labour party whose influence, now on the rise again, may have a telling effect on the forthcoming general election result.</p>

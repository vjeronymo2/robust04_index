			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAPPLETHORPE IMAGES  </P> <P> Mapplethorpe's life as a sexual individual and his attraction to our revolving  identities is enough to create more than just a "small cult following."  </P> <P> Yes, Mr. Wilson, he dangled the dramatics of sexual deviation in front of us.  </P> <P> And such leather-bound deviation is rife with varied interpretation. But  homosexuality and sexual experimentation are no rare experiences, and those of  us who are flagrantly and proudly gay support any and all expressions of open  individuality -- or social deviance.  </P> <P> Wilson tries to define human diversity as segregated "special interest groups."  But the empathy he is seeking in Mapplethorpe's work is evident in  reproductions of the human face, the human form.  </P> <P> What I am shocked at is the great deal of fear in Wilson's review, much akin to  the hysteria surrounding this exhibit. The fear that, without constraints,  freedom can be a dangerous thing.  </P> <P> But I respect the strength of the individual to interpret the questions that  Mapplethorpe's images arouse in such a way as to solidify a life-embracing  morality and to lighten the seriousness with which man confronts his own fears,  sexuality, role playing and death.  </P> <P> VODTJKA NOVOCHER-  </P> <P> KASSK  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Dial Asia Asia-Pacific has the world's fastest growing regional economy. But beyond a handful of developed countries, its telecommunications networks are primitive. According to the World Bank, across much of the region they 'continue to perform substantially and chronically beneath the needs of their respective economies'. Virtually all of the medium- and low-income countries in the region have long waiting lists for telephone lines. In nearly half of those countries it would take until 2000 or later to meet existing demand on the basis of recent growth rates. China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam - to take just the larger lower-income states - provide less than one phone line per 100 people. All governments in the region recognise the problem. Most of them also sense the solution: liberalisation of laws restricting the provision of telecommunications services. But across the region they are prevaricating, willing the end but suspicious of the means - particularly if it involves, as it inevitably does, the admission of overseas companies as partners in new ventures. Their main fears are for control and jobs. Ministers see telecommunications as 'strategic', so do not want to forfeit state control. They also worry that privatisation and competition will result in large-scale cost-cutting, as it has in developed countries. Both fears are unfounded or exaggerated. Privatisation of existing operators is not the first essential, as the World Bank study rightly notes. The priority is to license new operators to build lines and provide services, and to guarantee a sound regulatory and investment environment. That can be done without losing ultimate state control, notably by use of 'build, operate, transfer' contracts of the kind being pioneered by some countries. Similarly, privatisation need not involve the sale of a majority stake. The critical objective for developing countries should be to acquire a strategic partner with cash and telecoms knowhow. Governments would do well to study Venezuela's experience. In the two years since a consortium led by the US operator GTE took a minority stake in the country's state telephone company, it has received more network investment than in the previous 20 years. The moral is not restricted to telecommunications.</p>

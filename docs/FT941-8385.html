			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Sport: What England expects - Derek Wyatt looks forward to a tactical battle at Twickenham / Rugby Union England began last year's Five Nations Championship with a one point win against France 16-15 and then lost by a point to Wales 9-10. If justice has anything to do with rugby, England would have lost to France and beaten Wales. The loss to Wales showed that Will Carling could not think on his feet. Two weeks ago against Scotland it was the same story. This time it was not just Carling who failed to read the game but his lieutenant Brian Moore, who led the pack. Time and again, Neil Back was exposed at the end of the line-out; time and again the Scots cut off the route from Kyren Bracken, the scrum half, to Rob Andrew, the fly half, and lured Bracken into unsupported runs before ambushing him. In recent years the public has revised its expectations from England always winning, to England always winning with something in reserve. This afternoon a one-point win for England over Ireland at Twickenham will count as a national disaster. The team must not only beat the Irish, but must beat them comprehensively; for the England management has decided that this is the side that will beat France, the strongest team in the competition, in Paris in a fortnight. England's back play is constipated. I am tired of reading that the new laws make it more difficult for the three quarters. At the Parc des Prince in October, in the Second Test between France and Australia, Michael Lynagh destroyed the French side by running and attacking them whenever he had the ball in his hands. He hardly kicked at all. Only Stuart Barnes and Mike Catt, both of Bath, can follow Lynagh's example for England. Rob Andrew has a fine pedigree but his game has always lacked vision. Ireland will follow Scotland's lead and bombard Jon Callard with Garryowens. Neither of the Underwoods is secure under high balls and Callard, who remained largely untested against New Zealand, struggled when Scotland used this ploy. I would have preferred Ian Hunter to play on the right wing to act as a sweeper for Callard or even to switch with him in certain circumstances. Gone are the days when wingers just stayed on their wings. Tony Underwood missed a try against the All Blacks by carrying the ball under the wrong arm so he could not hand-off his tackler. He did it again in the Scotland game and again missed a try. He is fortunate the selectors have such patience. In player parlance, he owes England one: in my book, he owes England two. For Ireland, Eric Elwood has been magnificent. Magnificent at kicking that is. But the Irish strategy is hard to read. Elwood will soon be compared to an illustrious predecessor, Tony Ward, who was frequently criticised for playing just a kicking game. Will Elwood be allowed to play a wider game and is he capable of it? Poor Simon Geoghegan - the Irish winger must be starting to feel a forgotten man. Against France, Ireland had one tactic: to kick the ball over the French defensive lines. It failed but they went on playing that way and appeared happy for Elwood to kick goals. Even though these tactics lost against France and Wales, I doubt that they will be any different at Twickenham. The French take an unchanged side to Cardiff where they have not lost to Wales since 1982. The French front five is one of the heaviest in rugby history, but the back row of Abdelatif Benazzi, Philippe Benetton and Marc Cecillon could be severely tested. All three are specialist No 8s picked for the lineout in spite of their lack of mobility in the loose. The Welsh had done the psychologically difficult bit - they won their opening game against Scotland and followed it up with a composed win against Ireland. But their chance for their first Grand Slam since 1978, has been undermined by injuries to their backs. The shortage of tries and the increased importance of penalties, such as the controversial kick for handling in a ruck that gave England victory over Scotland, have exercised the rugby world this past fortnight. Since rugby is supposed to be a handling game, I do not understand why it is an offence to handle in the rucks, provided the player is not preventing the ball being played. The laws governing penalties are a muddle. The 'double' penalty that allows sides to kick to touch and still gain the throw in has made line-outs even more important. From the line-out the fly half then kicks the ball up in the air in the hope of winning the scrum from the ensuing 'turnover' maul or ruck. This is American football not rugby football. The penalty laws have so changed the nature and balance of the game that the international laws committee should reverse them at the end of these championships. They could also add a rider that an offence committed in the 'penalty' area of the defensive side's 22 should result in a penalty in front of the posts.</p>

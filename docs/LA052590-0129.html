			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMALL WINERIES BEAT GIANTS, KILL MARKETING PANEL  </P> <P> California's small, premium wineries won a major victory over industry giants  Thursday by voting the California Wine Commission out of existence. The  commission is the major marketing tool of the state's $6-billion wine industry.  </P> <P> The members' vote was 125-111 against retaining the commission for five more  years. In a separate vote, wineries representing 88.5% of the grape tonnage  crushed in 1989 voted to keep the commission. But a majority vote was needed in  both ballots to keep the commission going.  </P> <P> Bill MacIver of Matanzas Creek Winery, who helped spearhead a massive mail  campaign against the commission, said commissioners previously were elected by  a formula that allowed the state's largest wineries to dominate the  commission." He said that, under his plan, "half of the commissioners would be  elected on the basis of one winery, one vote."  </P> <P> One of the small wineries' major complaints was that $7 million of the  commission budget last year went to the Wine Institute, a private trade  organization. "And the small wineries didn't have a voice in how the money was  being spent or in Wine Institute," said one vintner.  </P></p>

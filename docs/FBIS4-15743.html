			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS -- "When speaking of  military-political cooperation and the Russian joining of NATO's  Partnership for Peace program, we cannot abstract ourselves from  economic factors and the Russian striving to join the `Great  Seven'," Presidential Press Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov told a  briefing here today.    "You know that Russia wants to join G7. Why shouldn't these  two problems be linked? If we are invited to cooperate in  political and military spheres, why shouldn't this be expanded  to economic cooperation?," he said. Kostikov said it is a  prerogative of the Foreign Ministry to decide who will sign the  document on Russian joining of the Partnership for Peace program  -- whether it will be Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev or it will  be signed at a "lower level".    "Bearing in mind unclear content and consequences of the  `Partnership' program, the State Duma has suggested to sign the  framework agreement at a lower level to have more space for  manoeuvre," said Kostikov. He said his task is to spare the  president and the State Duma of confrontation related to the  discussion or ratification of the Partnership for Peace program.  In this connection, Kostikov said that press reports on the  program concept are useful as they help to make the topic more  open.</p>

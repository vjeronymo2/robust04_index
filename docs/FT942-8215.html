			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / UK Company News: W'hampton &amp; Dudley edges ahead to Pounds 17.2m Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Breweries yesterday reported slightly higher first-half profits, helped by a 4.8 per cent increase in turnover and a modest improvement in trading margins. Pre-tax profits, including a Pounds 12,000 contribution from property disposals, increased by 3.4 per cent to Pounds 17.2m in the 26 weeks to April 3. The comparable figure of Pounds 16.7m included property disposals profits of Pounds 677,000. Earnings per share slipped to 17.5p (17.7p) mainly reflecting an increased tax charge of Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 5.03m). The interim dividend is lifted from 4.7p to 5.1p. The shares closed 11p higher at 554p. Turnover increased to Pounds 112.4m (Pounds 107.3m) although total barrelage slipped by 1.7 per cent mainly because of the run-off of low margin brewing contracts which came with the Camerons brewery acquisition in late 1991. Mr David Thompson, managing director, said turnover benefited from a strong performance by restaurants and managed houses. Covers in the Milestone Restaurants rose by 3.4 per cent on a like-for-like basis and by 27.6 per cent in the group's Taverns. Trading profits increased by 6.3 per cent to Pounds 19.7m (Pounds 18.5m) highlighting a solid performance by the group's brands, which include Banks's Mild and Camerons Scotch. Mr David Miller, chairman, noted that in the north-east good news about the economy has been rare and the group's customers have not felt any improvement in their circumstances. Instead, he suggested 'improvements to trading have been driven more by uplifts to pubs, acquisition and market share gains in free trade'. Trading margins improved from 17.3 per cent to 17.5 per cent, mainly due to improved productivity, higher income from games machines, which grew by 11.4 per cent, but partly offset by higher pub repair costs which rose by 12.7 per cent. COMMENT Wolverhampton and Dudley's management is refreshingly honest about the state of the beer market and the pressures on industry margins. Nevertheless, these are solid results and a good base to build on. Comparisons in this 52 week year - last year covered 53 weeks - will be made more difficult by the higher tax charge which is likely to rise from 30.4 per cent to 32.5 per cent, and by lower property profits. However, pre-tax profits should reach Pounds 37m for earnings of 37.2p. The shares are trading on a prospective p/e of 14.9 and look a reasonable buy.</p>

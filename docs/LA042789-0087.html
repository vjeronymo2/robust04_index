			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> NATIONAL BEST TIMES SURPRISE EVEN BURNHAM  </P> <P> There's nothing unexpected about Angela Burnham of Rio Mesa High winning a  race. It's how fast she runs that's surprising -- and no one has been more  shocked by her times than Burnham herself.  </P> <P> Burnham established national high school-leading times in the 100 and 400  meters Saturday in the Mt. San Antonio College Relays in Walnut.  </P> <P> She won the 100 meters in 11.57 to better the national best of 11.59 set by  archrival Inger Miller of Pasadena Muir. Miller beat Burnham with that time in  Arcadia Invitational on April 8.  </P> <P> "I'm really pleased with the 100 time because we haven't done any speedwork  yet," said Burnham, the defending state champion in the 100 and 200. "I wasn't  really concentrating on the 100, I was just using it as a warm-up for the 400."  </P> <P> Her most unexpected performance of the day came in the 400, where Burnham ran  54.09, bettering the year's previous fastest time of 54.39 set five minutes  earlier by Angela Rolfe of Los Angeles Dorsey.  </P> <P> "I was surprised with the (400) time," Burnham said. "My goal going into the  race was just to break 57."  </P> <P> Have a Dailey: Former Ventura High standout Steve Dailey hit three home runs  and had seven runs batted in for Oklahoma State on Saturday in the first game  of a doubleheader against Nebraska.  </P> <P> Dailey, a freshman, is batting a team-high .435 for the seventh-ranked Cowboys.  </P> <P> Signings: Matt Anderson of Buena High and John Bushart of Thousand Oaks, both  left-handed pitchers, have accepted baseball scholarships to Cal State  Northridge.  </P> <P> Anderson (4-1, 1.58 ERA) also plays outfield and leads the county with a .556  batting average. Bushart (5-1, 1.82) leads the county with 65 strikeouts.  </P> <P> Former Buena standout Mark Anderson, Matt's brother, played four years for  CSUN, including 1984 when the Matadors won their second Division II  championship.  </P> <P> Setting higher standards: Moorpark High administrators admit they are judging  coaches by a different standard than they use with teachers, and former  basketball Coach Rick Kent was among the first to feel the effect of that  policy.  </P> <P> Kent was dismissed as the boys' basketball coach last week after five seasons.  Kent had a 7-13 record and a 2-7 mark in Tri-Valley League play last season.  </P> <P> "I think coaches have to be accountable for their actions," Athletic Director  Rich Uphoff said. "Athletics, unlike teaching, is not a tenured position.  Coaches are offered a one-year contract and are judged subjectively and  objectively on an annual basis.  </P> <P> "We don't expect our coaches to have winning records every year, but over a  period of time we expect them to be successful."  </P> <P> Kent, who rejected a lower-level coaching position from Uphoff, said he will  continue to teach mathematics at Chapparral Middle School.  </P> <P> "I never said I was a good coach," Kent said. "It was for the fun and the  people that I coached. I enjoyed seeing the kids on a different level and I'll  miss it all a lot."  </P> <P> New Sycamore: As expected, Bubba Burrage signed a letter-of-intent Tuesday to  attend Indiana State on a basketball scholarship. Burrage, a forward from state  champion Santa Clara High, visited the Terre Haute, Ind., school two weeks ago.  </P> <P> Out for the season: Buena (13-2-1, 8-0), lost a top hitter when Tom Lyle was  declared academically ineligible. The designated-hitter/outfielder is batting  .417.  </P> <P> Stat Watch: Hueneme (8-10, 3-5) went 493 at-bats without a home run until Reyno  Ortega hit one in a 10-9 victory over Channel Islands on Saturday. . . . St.  Bonaventure pitchers Chris Castro and Kevin Zoll combined for six consecutive  complete games before the Seraphs used a relief pitcher Friday against Oak  Park. . . . Fillmore's Brad Edmonds has allowed one earned run in his last 27  innings. . . . Senior Sal Ledesma, in his first year of high school baseball,  leads Oxnard in stolen bases (nine) and is second in hits (14).  </P> <P> No time to rest: Gary Anglin was not in a mood to relax, even though his  Ventura College baseball team had a bye last Saturday. Instead, he scouted a  game between Oxnard and Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> "I would hate to look back when the season is over and think that I did not do  as much as I could to win it," Anglin said.  </P> <P> Ventura is atop the Western State Conference standings entering the last week  of regular-season play. The Pirates (14-4 in WSC play) have a slim lead over  second-place Canyons (13-4).  </P> <P> Ventura, which is trying to win its first WSC title in 15 years and become the  top-seeded team for the WSC's five-team playoff tournament, which begins  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Guest appearance: Steve Timmons, a two-time Olympic volleyball player on U. S.  teams that won gold medals, will appear at the Footlocker Store in Camarillo,  704 Arneil Road, today at 2 p.m.  </P></p>

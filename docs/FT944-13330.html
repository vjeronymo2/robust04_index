			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Economic Watch: Sweden raises interest rates Sweden's central bank, the Riksbank, yesterday moved to counter inflationary pressures by raising its key short-term interest rate, the repurchase rate, by 20 basis points to 7.40 per cent. It is the second time the bank has lifted interest rates in the last three months and the first increase since the Social Democrats won the September general elections. Analysts said the increase bolstered the Social Democrats' anti-inflation credentials following the appointment of Mr Kjell-Olof Feldt, a former Social Democrat finance minister, as chairman of the Riksbank's board of governors. The Riksbank warned last week that Swedish inflation might exceed the bank's target of 3.0 per cent next year. Rising producer prices and signs of bottlenecks in the manufacturing sector have already pushed up inflation to 2.7 per cent. The bank made its move despite the recent strengthening of the krona and a fall in long-term bond yields. East German industrial output rose in August by 14.1 per cent year-on-year after increasing in July by 9.4 per cent. West German engineering orders rose by 18 per cent in real terms in September from a year ago. Spanish industrial production rose by 11.6 per cent in August, after rising 4.8 per cent in July Belgian inflation figures were much better than expected, falling to 2.12 per cent in October from 2.46 per cent in September.</p>

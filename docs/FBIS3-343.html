			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] In Liberia, the seating of the transitional  government on Monday [7 March] continues to look increasingly  doubtful due to the rivalry within Alhaji Koromah's ULIMO  [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] faction.  Signs of a split in the movement first began to emerge with the  sacking of Dr. al- Mohamed Sheriff as ULIMO's representative in  the transitional council. This was followed by a claim by  Alhaji Koromah that the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of  Liberia] of Charles Taylor were attacking ULIMO in Lofa and Bong  counties but this claim was promptly denied by ULIMO's very own  military head, Roosevelt Johnson. And now more evidence of a  widening gap between the two men and their supporters have come  to light. From Monrovia, Nienate Allison telexed this report.    The rift in Alhaji Koromah's ULIMO is deepening. There was a  shoot-out last night between Koromah loyalists and forces in  favor of Roosevelt Johnson. The shooting, lasting for several  hours, occured near the Po River bridge just outside Monrovia  and sources said the situation remains confused today.    Travelers who arrived here today from ULIMO headquarters in  Tubmanburg said tension started building up when ULIMO leader,  Alhaji Koromah, ordered the disarmament of elements of the Krahn  ethnic group -- the second largest fighting force in ULIMO.  They said Koromah loyalists had disarmed all Krahn elements in  areas covering Kre and southwards toward the Po River bridge  where they met some resistance and decided to return to  Tubmanburg. However, they returned later in the day with  reinforcement and succeeded in disarming Roosevelt Johnson  loyalists. Thereafter, Roosevelt Johnson ordered troops from  his base in Kakata, 35 miles north of Monrovia, into the Po  River area to tighten security. Sources said that shooting  broke out finally between the two sides and lasted into the  early morning hours. On Thursday, the cracks in ULIMO were  highlighted. In an interview on Focus on Africa, Koromah  alleged that forces of Charles Taylor's NPFL were attacking  ULIMO forces in Salayie. Roosevelt Johnson, chairman of ULIMO's  military wing, denied Koromah's claim and yesterday accused him  of attempting to derail the peace process.    Meanwhile in another development, ULIMO today named (Dex  Tayowo) as its representative on the five-man transitional state  council. Tayowo, a Krahn, was an immigrant captain and until  his appointment served as ULIMO press coordinator. He replaces  Thomas Ziah, also a Krahn, who was sacked from the council on  Thursday.</p>

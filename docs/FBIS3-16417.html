He said the  lifting of the state of emergency could trigger off a new armed  conflict and make necessary the introduction of the armed forces  in the region. Shakhray spoke during the closed parliamentary  hearings in the Federation Council which discussed settlement of  the inter-ethnic conflict. According to Shakhray, the state of  emergency must be preserved, and does not demand significant  expenses.    Shakhray told Interfax that the cost of financing the  interim  administration in the conflict zone during 1993 had been put at  23 Bn rubles. He stressed that the Ingush budget was subsidized  by 97and the North Ossetian one by 60Both republics  explained the financing by the necessity to eliminate of the  conflict's consequences. However, "not a single house has as  yet been repaired," Shakhray said.    According to him, due to the current situation it was  necessary to resort to economic pressure through use of the  federal budget. This means that financial aid must be  conditioned with the holding of negotiations between the  conflicting parties. The central authorities must help with the  negotiations and establish the needed guarantees, he emphasized.    Shakhray said that during the parliament's meeting he had  received the impression that the North Ossetian and the Ingush  presidents were ready to negotiate.</p>

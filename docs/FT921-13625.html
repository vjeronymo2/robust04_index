			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Trial of Brooklyn's Dapper Don leaves nothing to chance THE racketeering and murder trial of Mr John Gotti, the reputed head of the biggest organised crime family in the US, begins today in Brooklyn. The 51-year-old Mr Gotti, known in the US media as the 'Dapper Don,' is charged by Federal prosecutors with five murders, extortion, illegal gambling and obstruction of justice. The most important of the murder charges concerns the December 1985 shooting of Mr Paul Castellano, the previous head of New York's Gambino crime family, whom Mr Gotti succeeded. Since 1986 Mr Gotti, a flamboyant dresser who has become something of a popular figure in the US, has been acquitted on lesser charges in three previous trials. The investigation that led to the latest indictments was aided by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents who clandestinely recorded Mr Gotti's conversations at his headquarters in Manhattan's Little Italy district. The trial, which will be directed by the US Attorney in Brooklyn, is expected to make use of three Mafia informers who have turned state's evidence. They include Mr Salvatore Gravano, who was initially a co-defendant and who has been identified by police as Mr Gotti's trusted consigliere, or right-hand man. US officials are trying hard to ensure their quarry is not acquitted this time. The presiding judge has already disqualified Mr Gotti's main defence lawyer on the grounds that he participated in conversations with Mr Gotti that were secretly taped as part of the government's evidence. The first few weeks of the trial, which is expected to last three or four months, will consist mainly of jury selection, which prosecutors deem extremely important since they argue that Mr Gotti's criminal organisation has a history of influencing jury members not to convict him. The jury candidates will therefore be chosen anonymously and will be sequestered under the protection of federal guards for the duration of the trial.</p>

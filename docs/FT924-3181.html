			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Siebe Siebe may have got to the point where it is difficult to squeeze much extra margin from cost cutting. But since it has 45 per cent of its sales in the US, this may not matter too much. A stronger dollar and the high operational gearing at Foxboro should compound the impact of US economic recovery on its earnings. On that basis, the upward trend which has seen the shares outperform the market by nearly 40 per cent over the past year may have further to run. The higher Siebe's rating, though, the greater must be the temptation to launch a rights issue and maybe another large acquisition. Siebe made it clear yesterday that this was not part of its short-term plan. Indeed there is no real urgency while debt is falling and interest is nearly four times covered. But the first inklings of an ACT problem have appeared and gearing would still be about 150 per cent were it not for Siebe's practice of capitalising research and development expenditure. A rights issue to finance a UK acquisition could solve both problems. This need be not be negative for the shares as long as any acquisition is chosen for real strategic value rather than mere financial convenience. Foxboro has served the company well. Just the same, the uncertainty may at some point damp the market's ardour.</p>

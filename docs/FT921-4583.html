			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Airline ticket shops bridge the Atlantic: The merger of Apollo and Galileo Airline industry mergers are possible after all. Just one week after talks between British Airways and KLM, the Dutch airline, collapsed, two of the world's biggest computerised reservation systems, Apollo of the US and UK-based Galileo, announced they are to merge. The trend towards global air transport provoked the 11 airlines that owned both systems to bury their differences to create a new Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 850m) company Although five of the 11 - BA, KLM, United Airlines, Swissair and Alitalia - held stakes in Galileo and Apollo, the deal is the first big merger in a business where most participants are state-owned and jealously guard their independence. Each of the world's handful of computer reservation systems (CRSs) carries information on hundreds of airlines. Travel agents can search for the cheapest fares, or ask for specific departure times or the fewest stops. Bookings can then be made and tickets issued. Passengers increasingly want to book flights anywhere in the world from their home countries. Business travellers need complex itineraries in advance and may want to change them during the trip. A CRS needs to be available in travel agencies around the world to serve these markets. CRSs do more than just sell tickets. Agents can use them to arrange car rental or rail tickets and cabins on cruise liners. Mostly they book passengers into hotels, some of which are owned by the airlines. Such is the lure of world domination, that even the biggest CRS, Sabre, owned by American Airlines, has sought in vain to merge with one of the two large European rivals, Amadeus, owned by Lufthansa of Germany, Iberia of Spain and Air France. Apollo is the second biggest and Galileo is the other European CRS. Their merger is not as dramatic as if airlines themselves had merged. But the driving force that created Galileo International - globalisation of the industry - has also pushed carriers on both sides of the Atlantic to take stakes in each other and hold unsuccessful merger talks. Perhaps most importantly, airline involvement in a CRS could allow them to make more money from each aircraft seat. The airlines call it inventory control. Almost 30 different fares are sold on each transatlantic Boeing 747. Airlines struggle daily to cut prices enough to sell seats but keep them high enough to make money. They must be prepared to switch wide-bodied jets quickly to new routes if demand rises and decide when to offer upgrades. 'Airlines can maximise their revenue streams by inventory control. It's indispensable,' says Mr Kevin Murphy, an airline analyst with Morgan Stanley in New York. The dividing line between success and failure is fine. American Airlines, one of the top two in the US, says that one extra passenger on every flight would add Dollars 114m to revenues and almost that much to profits. Last year was one of the worst years in its, and the industry's, history. American was about two passengers a flight short of profitability. 'The CRS is the way into controlling passenger flows and will become more important with passenger growth,' says Mr Richard Allen, airlines analyst with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London. Such control is not cheap. Amadeus has spent Dollars 3bn establishing itself, much of it on software. Sabre, the biggest CRS and owned by American Airlines, takes bookings for 1.6m flights daily and deals with 20 times that many enquiries on 740 airlines. The rewards can be high. Sabre's turnover was about Dollars 550m last year in spite of the Gulf War and recession-induced slump in air traffic. Sabre has a bigger turnover than American Airlines' entire cargo operation. In spite of its size, Sabre attempted a merger last year with Amadeus. The plan foundered in October largely because the computers were incompatible. Amadeus is talking to Worldspan and System One, the third and fourth biggest US CRSs. 'We hope to make an announcement on technical links with Amadeus within weeks,' says Mr Roy Burnham, Worldspan's European managing director. Mr John Pope, chairman of the consortium that runs Apollo and a vice-chairman of United Airlines, said the deal cemented and formalised the relationship with Galileo. The two groups faced few technical problems. Galileo had licenced its software from Apollo, and they have set up task forces to examine ways to cut costs. Mr Pieter Bouw, president of Galileo and chairman of KLM, the Dutch airline, says most savings will come from staff cuts among about 500 data-processing staff in Swindon, headquarters of the pre-merger Galileo. The computer centre for Galileo International will be in Denver, Colorado. In return, the European airlines in Galileo International can appoint the first chairman of the group. Mr Bouw refuses to commit himself over whether lower costs mean falling booking fees. And he struggles to identify any tangible benefits to passengers. The savings will probably end up on the bottom line of the airline industry and add to the reputation of CRSs as money-making machines. Airline chief executives would rather sell their airlines than lose their reservation systems, runs an after-dinner joke in the industry. Yet sell their reservation systems is what they may be asked to do. The US Department of Transport is scheduled to re-examine CRS industry rules before the summer. It is worried about the potential advantages ownership of a CRS gives. CRS owners will be able to control inventories better; new airlines will face higher barriers in an already capital-intensive business. Top of the list for criticism is Sabre because it is owned by a single airline. American Airlines insists Sabre does not promote its own tickets. Other CRS owners are equally adamant their technology has no favourites. But that will not make the critics go away, and pressures to float off CRSs as independent corporations are likely to grow. One response is further mergers. Diluting the ownership among greater numbers of airlines could deflect criticism. But the bigger prize to be won through consolidation is raising the value of the system. CRSs executives give few clues as to the worth of networks. But by taking the value of Apollo as Dollars 1bn in 1988, when a half share was sold by United Airlines, taking into account traffic growth since then and the systems' estimates of their market shares, Sabre alone could be worth at least Dollars 1.5bn. The recent history of the airline industry is littered with failed attempts to create international mergers. CRS collaboration may yet provide a model for the world's airlines to join forces to offer one-stop shopping for the aircraft as well as the tickets.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- System       Owned by                 Approx market share  Approx value                                                            (Dollars)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Worldspan    TWA/Delta/Abacus         5%-10% of Europe/    500m                                       10% of US System One   Continental/EDS          5%-10% of Europe/    500m                                       10% of US Sabre        American Airlines        5%-10% of Europe/    1.5bn-2bn                                       44% of US Galileo      11 US/European           40% of Europe        400m              airlines Apollo       11 US/European           30% of US            1.1bn+              airlines Amadeus      Lufthansa/Air France/    50%-65% of Europe/   600m              Iberia                   5%-10% of US Axess        Japan Airlines           60% of Japan         500m Infini       All Nippon Airlines      30% of Japan         500m              Abacus Abacus       Five Asian airlines/            up to         650m              Worldspan  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

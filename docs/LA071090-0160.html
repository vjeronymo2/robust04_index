			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MAPPLETHORPE EXHIBITOR DOUBTS LEGAL ACTIONS  </P> <P> The director of the Boston gallery that will host a controversial touring  exhibit of Robert Mapplethorpe photographs next month says he expects some  protests but no legal challenges to the show.  </P> <P> "We're not anticipating any legal challenges at the moment," David Ross,  director of the Institute of Contemporary Arts, told a news conference.  </P> <P> The exhibit, "Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment," consists of about 160  Mapplethorpe photographs, mainly of flowers, nudes and faces. But it includes  five works depicting homoerotic acts and two of nude children from  Mapplethorpe's "Z" portfolio, which some politicians and religious groups have  branded obscene.  </P> <P> The National Endowment for the Arts came under fire for helping fund the show  in Washington last summer, sparking a national debate on obscenity in the arts  and fueling a congressional battle over the NEA's grant process.  </P> <P> The exhibit appeared in several cities without incident and drawing  record-breaking crowds until it reached Cincinnati, where a gallery and its  director face a jury trial on obscenity charges for exhibiting Mapplethorpe's  works. Record numbers also saw the show in Cincinnati, where it was closed for  only one day while officials photographed the works.  </P> <P> Ross told reporters that several groups, which he refused to name, have vowed  to mount protests against the show and that he has been asked privately not to  exhibit the "Z" portfolio.  </P> <P> But Ross, a friend of the late Mapplethorpe who died in Boston last year, said  there is "no chance, no way that this exhibit will be edited."  </P> <P> Ross said the small gallery in Boston's Back Bay expected up to 70,000 people  to see the exhibit, about as many as ordinarily visit the museum in an entire  year.  </P> <P> Membership in the institute, which will be the last gallery to host the  exhibition, has in recent weeks increased 50%, he said.  </P></p>

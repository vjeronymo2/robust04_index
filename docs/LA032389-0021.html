			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> VINCENT CASE 1ST MAJOR TEST OF STATE CAMPAIGN FUND LAW  </P> <P> Before the attorney general's office accused him this week of using campaign  contributions for his personal benefit, Mayor Edward Vincent expressed  disbelief at the official attention focused on his campaign spending.  </P> <P> In several interviews, Vincent described his campaign fund as "my money."  </P> <P> But under a 1981 state law, it's not his money to spend any way he wants. The  law says campaign contributions must be used for political or governmental  purposes, not personal benefit.  </P> <P> The 1981 law does provide considerable leeway, experts said, and confusion  sometimes arises -- among officeholders and even enforcement agencies -- over  what constitutes personal use of campaign contributions.  </P> <P> But they also said the conduct alleged in the attorney general's suit against  Vincent illustrates the need for the legal barrier between personal and  political funds that was established only after intense debate. The suit  alleges that Vincent spent more than $5,000 on travel, truck repairs, clothes  and a veterinarian's bill, among other things.  </P> <P> Vincent has declined to comment since the suit was filed Monday.  </P> <P> Robert Stern, head of the nonprofit California Commission on Campaign  Financing, was a leader in the fight for passage of the personal-use  prohibitions. In 1981, Stern said, outrage peaked over disclosures that  politicians used campaign funds to pay for items such as divorce proceedings  and video recorders. Some legislators even paid their campaign war chests to  themselves when they left office, calling the transactions "retirement pay."  </P> <P> In an attempt to force a reluctant Legislature's hand, Tom Houston, then the  chairman of the state Fair Political Practices Commission, proposed a new FPPC  regulation barring personal uses of campaign funds, to be enforced by the state  commission.  </P> <P> Legislators balked. The compromise that emerged was a somewhat weaker bill that  provided for enforcement by the state attorney general, Stern said.  </P> <P> The law, Election Code Section 12401, prohibits campaign spending that creates  a substantial personal benefit and "does not have more than a negligible  political or legislative purpose." It provides a fine of $500, or twice the  violation, whichever is greater.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tough to Prove  </P> <P> Successful prosecution requires that an officeholder's misuse of funds be  "willful and knowing," a standard that investigators describe as tough to  prove.  </P> <P> Indeed, the suit against Vincent marks the first prosecution of an elected  official under the law. State officials are seeking fines from Vincent  amounting to twice the more than $5,000 he allegedly misspent during the past  two years.  </P> <P> In commenting on the Vincent case, Stern noted that previous investigations  have ended with politicians being allowed to repay their campaign war chests  for questionable expenses.  </P> <P> "First of all, most people comply with the law," Stern said. "Second of all,  the law is fairly generous. And finally, I think, when people are close to the  line, the attorney general has been forgiving."  </P> <P> Given that history -- and the apparent reluctance of elected officials to  prosecute other elected officials -- the attorney general's hard line on the  Vincent case reflects what investigators termed systematic and clear-cut  violations.  </P> <P> "You are taking money out of the system that could be used for campaigns,"  Stern said. "The idea was that if you couldn't use the money for personal use,  you wouldn't raise it. Whereas if you could do it, people would be out raising  money all the time."  </P> <P> Stern noted that elected officials must disqualify themselves from voting on  issues involving individuals who have given them more than $250 in direct gifts  or income. However, he said, officials do not have to disqualify themselves in  the cases of campaign contributors, no matter how much is given. They only have  to report the contribution on campaign disclosure forms if it is $100 or more.  </P> <P> The suit against Vincent may help establish more concrete limits on how far  elected officials can go, Stern said.  </P> <P> "Any time you bring an enforcement action," Stern said, "you send a signal to  others."  </P></p>

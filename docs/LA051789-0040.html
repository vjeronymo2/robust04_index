			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> A RED-HOT JEREMIAD ON U.S. JUSTICE  </P> <P> With Justice for None: Destroying an American Myth by Gerry Spence (Times Book:  $18.95, 432 pages)  </P> <P> Gerry Spence is mad as hell, and he's not going to take it any more.  </P> <P> Spence is the celebrated and intentionally colorful trial lawyer from Wyoming  who is best known for his work on the Karen Silkwood case and the lawsuit  brought by a former Miss Wyoming against Penthouse magazine. "With Justice for  None" is Spence's red-hot jeremiad on what's wrong with the American judicial  system and the American way of life. According to Spence, just about everything  has gone wrong.  </P> <P> "I have spent most of my life representing ordinary people against the  corporate giants. Sometimes I feel like the farmer on his 40 acres who has to  take on God and all of the elements," Spence proclaims. "Yet in this tangled,  frantic, commercial society, can we expect justice except by the immutable  rules of Darwin? In our system, money is power." And Spence concludes: "The  truth is there is no justice in America for the people."  </P> <P> Spence styles himself as a latter-day prophet, full of hellfire and brimstone,  and his firecracker prose is so much like the sputtering (and faintly  demogogic) rhetoric of 19th-Century populism that his book often seems almost  antique: "A new king dominates in America, a sovereign whose soul is pledged to  business and whose heart is geared to profit. The new king, an amorphous  agglomeration of corporations, of banks and insurance companies and mammoth  multinational financial institutions, maintains a prurient passion for money  and demands a justice of its own."  </P> <P> Spence has nothing good to say about any aspect of the system in which he makes  a living:  </P> <P> On lawyers, law students and law schools: "Today there are not too many  lawyers, but too few -- too few of the right kind; too few who are trained as  fighters; too few who will represent the people. . . . Skillfully, designedly,  our young have made themselves salable to corporate America as replacement  parts for the legal machine that grinds away in corporate law firms at lush  hourly rates."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cases on Appeal  </P> <P> On judges and juries: "Judges, not juries, decide our cases in America. . . .  More often than not, our cases on appeal are decided by a jury of judges  composed of persons most lawyers would have challenged summarily from any jury  panel. . . . The misery of the people seeking justice is no more vivid to the  judges than reading about any other tragedy in the morning news. Judges see  paper, not people. They see the lifeless briefs heaped upon their benches like  great mountains in stark black and white."  </P> <P> On insurance companies: "The insurance company is the God of Money. But the God  of Money is not a benevolent god. It does not love us. It loves only its  dollars, and it will hire the best lawyers in the land to keep them."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Corporations Clobbered  </P> <P> On corporations: "That corporate America . . . cheerfully barters the lung  tumors of its asbestos workers for profit, exchanges the brain damage of  thousands of children from lead poisoning for earnings . . . and, without  adequate testing, feeds carcinogens to an entire nation to secure a possible  early market advantage, diminishes the likes of Charles Manson to a prankster  at a Sunday school picnic."  </P> <P> Spence devotes the second half of the book to his own plan for the reform of  the legal system, which also seems to contemplate the remaking of the American  way of life. He calls for "people's" lawyers and "people's" judges, whatever  that means, who will bring a messianic future of perfect justice: "For them,  the love of justice will become as real as the love of art, as the love of  discovery, as the love of truth." And Spence concedes that he is calling for  nothing less than a revolution: "We must smash the trick mirrors," he writes.  "Change will come only when we have slammed the system up against them all and  stared it down. . . ."  </P> <P> Happily enough for the reader, "With Justice for None" is not always or even  mostly a catalogue of Spence's complaints about the judicial system. Spence,  like most seasoned trial lawyers, simply cannot resist the temptation to tell  war stories, to relive an artful cross-examination or a triumphant closing  argument, and to generally portray himself as the damned fine lawyer that he  surely believes himself to be and probably is. (At one point, when Spence is  contemplating why lawyers are regarded with such contempt, he confesses: "I  hated being hated.") And so the best moments in Spence's book are introduced  with the irresistible phrase: "Let me tell you a story."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gold-Plated Cogs  </P> <P> Still, Spence's book is a war cry and not a collection of war stories. As a  former "big-firm" attorney who now practices in a small law office, I  appreciate how a lawyer like Spence feels when he comes up against the armies  of high-priced lawyers who serve as gold-plated cogs in the legal machine. But  I also know -- and I'm quite sure that Gerry Spence knows -- that the sole  practitioner or the small firm can prevail over a wealthy and powerful  adversary, and justice, however crude and incomplete, can be done. The fact is  that Spence, as a true believer in perfect justice, does not yearn for the mere  reform of the legal system -- rather, he is a visionary for whom the imperfect  justice of this world will never be enough.  </P></p>

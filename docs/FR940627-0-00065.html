The regulations reflect the enactment of section 414(r) by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent changes made by the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 and the Public Debt Limit Increase Act of 1989. The regulations provide guidance necessary to comply with the law and affect sponsors of and participants in tax-qualified retirement plans and certain other employee benefit plans.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  These regulations are effective January 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulations apply to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1994, except as provided in the transition rules of &sect;1.414(r)&hyph;1(d)(9).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Patricia McDermott at (202) 622&hyph;4606 (not a toll-free number). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed regulations under section 414(r) and related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on February 1, 1991 (56 FR 3988). Written comments were received from the public on the proposed regulations. In addition, a public hearing on the proposed regulations was held on May 16, 1991. After consideration of all the written comments received and the statements made at the public hearing, the proposed regulations under section 414(r) were adopted, as modified, by final regulations (TD 8376) published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 4, 1991 (56 FR 63420).

Written comments were received from the public on the proposed regulations, and a public hearing was held on November 10, 1993. After consideration of all the written comments received and the statements made at the public hearing, these regulations are adopted as modified by this Treasury decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Temporary regulations (TD 8173) and proposed regulations under section 414(q) of the Code (relating to the definition of highly compensated employee) were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on February 19, 1988 (53 FR 4965 and 4999). In conjunction with the February 1991 proposed regulations under section 414(r), amendments to the temporary regulations (TD 8334) and proposed regulations under section 414(q) were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on February 1, 1991 (56 FR 3976 and 4023). The amendments related to the employee exclusions for purposes of satisfying the 50-employee requirement for a separate line of business under section 414(r)(2)(A) of the Code. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 7805(e)(2) of the Code, the February 1991 amendments to the temporary regulations under section 414(q) expired after three years (January 31, 1994). In order to retain the application of those rules, the February 1991 proposed regulations under section 414(q) are adopted by this Treasury decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Explanation of Provisions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Overview <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In general, all employees of a single employer, determined under section 414 of the Code, are taken into account for purposes of applying the minimum coverage requirements of section 410(b) and the minimum participation requirements of section 401(a)(26) to a qualified plan. Section 410(b)(5) provides an exception if an employer operates qualified separate lines of business under section 414(r). If the employer is treated as operating qualified separate lines of business, section 410(b)(5) generally permits the employer to apply the minimum coverage requirements separately with respect to the employees of each qualified separate line of business. A similar exception is provided for purposes of applying the minimum participation requirements of section 401(a)(26) and the 55-percent average benefits test of section 129(d)(8). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An employer is treated as operating qualified separate lines of business if (1) the employer designates its lines of business by reference to the property or services provided by each line, (2) each line of business is organized and operated separately from the remainder of the employer, and (3) each of these separate lines of business meets additional statutory requirements (including administrative scrutiny) and thus constitutes a qualified separate line of business. Each employee of an employer that operates qualified separate lines of business is assigned to a particular line of business for purposes of nondiscrimination testing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The September 1993 proposed regulations amend the final regulations under section 414(r) generally to address issues raised since the publication of the final regulations. The proposed regulations include the following major changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Allowing an employee to be treated as a substantial-service employee with respect to a line of business if at least 50 percent of the employee's services are provided to that line. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Applying the separate management and separate workforce tests to a line of business without regard to substantial-service employees of other lines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Excluding nonresident aliens in applying the separate management and separate workforce tests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Expanding the special rules for vertically integrated lines of business and transferred employees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Increasing access to individual determinations under administrative scrutiny. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Clarifying the treatment of employees who change from one disaggregation population to another.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

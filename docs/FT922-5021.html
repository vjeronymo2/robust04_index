			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Letter: The myth surrounding vocational training Sir, May I express my amusement at your article 'Vocational tests body comes under attack' (May 28). Part of the problem in this debate is that everyone is trying to compare apples with pears. The competence-based approach quite rightly (if you are an employer) insists that the key issue is that an individual demonstrates his or her ability to do a particular job competently. It recognises that, to do so, the person needs some theoretical knowledge, but it focuses primarily on the acquisition of appropriate skills. How sensible] The traditional academic approach quite rightly (if you are trying to develop an academic) concentrates on giving a large amount of knowledge but training the student in a limited range of skills, primarily research, analysis and argument. Unfortunately, somewhere along the road a lot of business training was developed using the academic model. The competency approach is demonstrating just how poorly the other translates into practical skills. This is the real cause for all the academic sound and fury. Your own final paragraph continued with the woolly thinking and typical British snobbery that has dominated this debate. It implies that it is strange to consider a set of practical competences, including handling documents and answering phone calls, as equivalent to a GCSE. Why? As both a graduate in physics and an experienced manager, I find no difficulty in recognising the breadth of competences defined by the Management Charter Initiative level 1 (NVQ level 4) for example, as broadly equivalent to my degree course. Yours is a respected newspaper; please do not continue to propagate the myth that the ability to demonstrate academic knowledge is much more difficult or important than demonstrating a range of administrative, managerial or practical skills.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] George Town, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands (CANA) --  Four Jamaican nationals living in the Cayman Islands were  charged Tuesday with a variety of drug offences after police  seized more than 350 pounds of marijuana over the New Year's  weekend.    The four are Robert Everton Neil and Robert Gammon, both of  St. Elizabeth, Jamaica and Seaford John Singh and Stalinova  Singh, husband and wife from Clarendon.    All four were charged with possession of a controlled drug  with intent to supply along with simple possession.    Prosecuting Attorney (Crown Counsel) Adam Roberts said the  foursome were part of a sophisticated operation, headed by Neil  in the Cayman Islands, with an "origination" in Jamaica.    Magistrate Peter Jackson denied bail for the four, despite  the pleas from Mrs. Singh that she had six children in Jamaica  and needed to care for them.    Bail was denied on the grounds the defendents would likely  leave the island as they have few local ties, Jackson said.    The 352 pounds of marijuana seized by Drugs Squad officers  has an estimated street value of US$450,000, said Drugs Squad  superintendent Trevor Cutts.    Cutts has not ruled out further arrests in the ongoing case  and has said he is pursuing leads on how drugs are getting from  Jamaica to Cayman.</p>

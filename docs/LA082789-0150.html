			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ACADEMY RECRUIT  </P> <P> On Aug. 15 in the Orange County section, you published an article that said a  female police recruit at the Orange County Sheriff's Academy was the first  female recruit to graduate at the top of the class.  </P> <P> This was incorrect. Myrna Caballerd of the class No. 85 graduated No. 1 in the  class, several classes before the recruit from Newport Beach.  </P> <P> We were proud of her achievement and feel she should get the recognition.  </P> <P> PAUL D'AURIA  </P> <P> President, class No. 85  </P> <P> San Clemente Police Department  </P></p>

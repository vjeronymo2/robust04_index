			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Letter: Greater beneficiaries of Uruguay round Sir, Richard Blackhurst (Letters, August 2) points out that a Uruguay round settlement will bring net gains in trade leading to absolute gains in income and employment in the US and European Community. The gains for many developing countries may be proportionally even greater. Developing countries will gain from the rise in world income for all the reasons outlined by Mr Blackhurst. But they have an additional interest because this round has for the first time included two sectors, agriculture and textiles and clothing, that did not benefit from the reductions in barriers achieved by other goods in previous rounds. These sectors are those of greatest interest to developing countries, which are seeking to sustain export expansion without succumbing to 'jobless growth'. On the basis of the Dunkel Draft settlement, the Overseas Development Institute (in The Gatt Uruguay Round: Effects on Developing Countries) has estimated that the effects from these net export gains alone would be at least 3 per cent of the value of their exports (equivalent to Dollars 25bn), and could well be twice that. These figures in turn could be doubled by effects from the income gains to their industrial country trading partners, and the wage advantage for export production over local markets is probably even greater for them. This explains why so many developing countries are participating fully in the Uruguay round negotiations for the first time. They have viewed the recent US-EC stand-off on agricultural protection with irritation at being treated as bystanders at what they hope will be a feast for all.

			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ANGRY ARTIST;  </P> <P> PHILIP CORNELIUS DOESN'T MIND A LITTLE TURMOIL  </P> <P> When artist Philip Cornelius makes teapots, he provides the tempest too.  </P> <P> "What I do is so freaky, I can't have anyone around," he says, his speech  punctuated by expletives, his eyes flashing behind tortoise-shell glasses, his  thick hands swirling through the air. "I can't be disturbed. If I get  disturbed, I fall apart."  </P> <P> At 56, he is one of America's most acclaimed best known for his "thinware"  designs. Cornelius, who has taught at Pasadena City College for 25 years, molds  delicate sheets of porcelain into abstract forms, almost all based on the  common household teapot.  </P> <P> He says he likes teapots because they are containers, and like all containers,  they are useful. "Containment is important to me because it has a sense of  function," he says. "Teapots are big ugly things. It took me to turn them into  art."  </P> <P> Indeed, Cornelius' teapots don't look anything like what you'd find on a  kitchen stove. Many of them are charred, rough-hewn vessels, evoking images of  warships, planes and tanks. But they also somehow convey a sense of refinement  and vulnerability.  </P> <P> Garth Clark, who represents Cornelius and sells his pieces at Los Angeles and  New York galleries for as much as $3,500 each, calls the work "highly  contradictory."  </P> <P> There is a tension "between being tough and hard and being fragile and  vulnerable," Clark says. "These objects are very much about contradiction."  </P> <P> So is the artist.  </P> <P> As a teacher, Cornelius is giving and interested in his students' work. But as  an artist, he is intensely private and guarded about his own.  </P> <P> In his classroom, where 17 students wear aprons to protect themselves from a  blanket of red clay and gray dust, Cornelius demonstrates basic ceramic-making  techniques. But he doesn't discuss the trademark style that has taken him  decades to develop: working with incredibly fine layers of clay and yet still  firing them in the kiln at intensely hot temperatures.  </P> <P> "It's not my job to show them what I do," Cornelius says, lifting his cap from  his head and running his fingers through his slightly graying hair. "It's  really none of their business. I don't need to open my soul to them."  </P> <P> Although Cornelius divides his time between the classroom and the studio behind  his Spanish-style home in Pasadena, the artist has been careful to keep the two  worlds separate.  </P> <P> Many of Cornelius' students, in fact, have no idea that their teacher has  pieces featured in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the San Francisco  Museum of Modern Art, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and the  Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London.  </P> <P> "I've learned a lot from him in just two weeks," says John Sih, 28, an engineer  who took his first ceramics class at Pasadena City College this summer. "I had  no idea that he is so well known. I guess I wouldn't really expect that here."  </P> <P> Cornelius began teaching at PCC in 1965 after earning his undergraduate degree  in science from San Jose State University and a master's in fine arts from  Claremont Graduate School. He says he has continued to teach at the community  college all these years because the school has given him the freedom to do his  own work. "Professor/artist, artist/professor -- both are an important part of  who I am and what I do," he says.  </P> <P> "Maybe someone who teaches at a major university or a prestigious art school  has more professional clout than I do. But I'm not into professional clout, I'm  into art clout. I don't take my power from teaching, I take my power from what  I do with clay."  </P> <P> Teaching at PCC, Cornelius says, "has enabled me to lead a fairly normal life,  to pay the bills and raise a family. It would have been too spooky for me to be  an artist and raise two kids. It would have been living too much on the edge."  </P> <P> Cornelius' current work is an exploration of mayhem, an idea that has always  interested him. Earlier teapots drew inspiration from World Wars I and II. The  newest series, he says, refers to a new breed of war. The teapots, dotted with  body parts, are charred in the kiln "almost like third-degree burns."  </P> <P> He mentions Iraq.  </P> <P> "I have a lot on my mind now," Cornelius says. "We have had an unprecedented  peace, and now we are going to have an unprecedented amount of war."  </P> <P> Cornelius' propensity for firing his pieces until they are on the verge of  destruction is as important an expressive quality as the way he shapes the  clay. "Putting them in the kiln is like putting them in a tomb," he says. "I  like to fire right to the edge. It's like they've been through a war."  </P> <P> His work, consequently, is not always pleasant to look at. Wayne Kuwada,  director of the Garth Clark Gallery in Los Angeles, says Cornelius' work is  "tougher than a lot of what you see in the ceramic world."  </P> <P> "Because of the imagery, his stuff isn't particularly soothing," Kuwada says.  "You have to go beyond looking for the beautiful object. He always takes his  work a step beyond."  </P> <P> Says Cornelius: "No one fires as hard as I do. And if they did, I'd fire even  harder."  </P> <P> Hoder is a Studio City free-lance writer.  </P></p>

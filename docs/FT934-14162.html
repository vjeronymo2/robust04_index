			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / London commuters hit by 6% rise in rail and Tube fares TRAVELLERS face fare increases in the new year averaging 6 per cent on London Transport, Network SouthEast and Scotrail services - but most InterCity ticket prices will remain the same, it was announced yesterday. After pressure from Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, plans for double-figure rises - outlined in British Rail documents leaked this summer  -were all but abandoned by operators. The increases are three times the rate of retail price inflation and will affect London commuters particularly hard. The cost of the capital's popular, unlimited-use Travelcards will rise by up to 10 per cent as London Transport attempts to bring them closer to their travel value. A weekly one-zone Travelcard will cost Pounds 10.20 next January, compared with Pounds 9.30 previously. A two-zone underground journey will rise by 10p to Pounds 1.30. Network SouthEast - which was earlier rumoured to be planning increases of up to 16 per cent - responded to government pressure to keep its average fare rises well below double figures. The average rise for season tickets on most of the network's routes will be 6 per cent, but higher on better-performing lines such as Chiltern and West Anglia. Following Citizen's Charter policy, the network's rises on poorer-performing Kent Coast and Thames routes will be lower, at 3 per cent. Off-peak fares will rise by 4 per cent. Mr John Nelson, the network's managing director, emphasised that the average rise would not be enough to overcome the 'very serious financial situation' stemming from the 100,000 fall in the number of BR commuters and a drop in property sales. InterCity, which receives no subsidy, increased only its standard open ticket fares by an average of 3 per cent. Passenger groups criticised the fare rises for outstripping inflation and the government for failing to deliver enough funding. The London Regional Passengers' Committee said the government had placed BR and LT in an 'impossible position' by depriving them of funds and of powers to impose higher fare increases. It called on the government to allocate sufficient funds in the November Budget to enable BR and LT to maintain their transport systems and operate them safely. Mr Michael Patterson, secretary of the Central Transport Consultative Committee, the rail users' watchdog, said: 'Increases on some lines of up to four times the rate of inflation are unprecedented and this will do nothing to reverse the huge drop in rail commuting over recent years.'

"The memorandum is not a document imposed on the Romanian  Government by the IMF. It reflects in fact the government's  economic principles negotiated and approved by the IMF, for the  principles in the memorandum are part of the Romanian  Government's economic reform strategy. That is why I view as  false the references regarding the fact that the IMF is  dictating to us, that the memorandum could have had negative  effects. In fact these are issues specific to the process of  transition and economic reform in Romania, directly linked to  the essence of the government's economic policy. The truth is  that we are facing a difficult situation which implies also  specific restrictive measures that we are to self-impose on us,  precisely to relaunch and bring to normality the economic life  in our country."    Related to Romania's participation in the NATO programme of  Partnership for Peace, President Ion Iliescu stated the  following: "the taken decision is a solution for which we have  strived a lot. It was obvious that there were several efforts in  the past years to impose a discriminatory treatment in the ties  with the countries in this area... It seems to me that once with  the American Administration's initiative that has carried into  effect that partnership, the NATO leadership has answered  Romania's fundamental concerns regarding non-discriminatory  elements among the countries in this part of Europe. That is  why the adopted solution seems to be the most correct one  corresponding to the current period".    Ion Iliescu also showed criticism over certain positions  expressed in Romania against the country's participation in the  Partnership for Peace programme. "To follow this line would  mean nothing else but to give satisfaction precisely to those  who are seeking to isolate Romania and put our country at threat  as regards its security and stability".</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Leaders of the Agrarian Party and its parliamentary  faction, the Agrarian Union and the Agricultural Trade Union  Central Committee will meet in Moscow on May 10 in order to  examine and to weigh up once again the agreement on agricultural  policy guidelines for the next two years. The agreement has  recently been signed with the Russian government. Afterwards,  the Agrarians will make their final decision whether or not to  sign the treaty on civil accord. This was announced by Deputy  Chairman of the Agrarian Union, Gennadiy Kulik. The union  includes Russia's biggest agricultural enterprises.    Kulik suggested that this meeting was needed since none of  the signatories had as yet seen the final text of the document.  That is why the Agrarian Party, the Agrarian Union and the  Agricultural Trade Union wanted to make sure if the government  had accepted all their demands.    In particular, the Agrarians insisted that the government  included into the treaty a number of obligations in order to  prevent forceful pressure on farmers when choosing forms of  property, to ensure Russia's independence in food supply and to  support the agricultural regions with 10 or 15 percent of the  budget expenses. Several other conditions have also been put  forward.    The agreement was signed on April 30 on the day after the  ceremony of signing of the treaty on civil accord in the  Kremlin. The Agrarian leaders did not take part in the ceremony.</p>

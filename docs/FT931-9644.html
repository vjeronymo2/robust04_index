			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / The way out for Major If all else fails, trim your sails. Mr John Major's cabinet is guided by the thought expressed in that little couplet. It is what gets the prime minister through the night. But how to trim? It is easy to commandeer taxpayers' money to pay for wasteful but politically popular hospitals, coal mines or army regiments. It is not so easy when what is at stake is a matter of principle, as with the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty. Yet as I shall suggest in a moment, there is always something. Consider. Parliament has been told that it must accept or reject the totality of what was agreed by the 12 European Community governments in December 1991. That includes the bit regarded by the prime minister as his personal triumph - the protocol on social policy. According to that celebrated excuse-note, 11 of the member states - but not Britain  - are anxious to adopt the no doubt admirable but costly employment practices laid down in the 1989 'social charter', which gives various rights to employees and imposes numerous obligations on employers. An agreement on this social policy, applicable only to the 11 countries that want to implement it, is appended. Labour says that it wants the terms of that agreement to apply in Britain, so it has put down an amendment that would write the protocol out. The Liberal Democrats concur. Both parties appear to imagine that what will follow if Labour's amendment is carried will be a brief recall of the 12 EC governments, upon which Mr Major will shrug his shoulders, say 'that is what parliament wants' and sign a new treaty that commits Britain to a Continental-style social policy. There is a certain inconsistency here. Under Mr John Smith's guidance Labour is distancing itself from the more expensive forms of social democracy practised in northern Europe. Labour's leader may one day find the social charter a shade too far to the left for the image that he is trying to project. The Conservative Euro-sceptics have a different problem. They see the social charter as a characteristic manifestation of the kind of socialism that would be imposed on Britain by a European super-state. Yet they are suggesting that they will vote for the Labour amendment, on the ground that there is no danger of the prime minister renegotiating the treaty to include the social policy. Some believe the consequence would be that the whole enterprise would be scuppered. This interpretation has been endorsed by Mr Douglas Hurd, who has intimated that if the ratification bill is not passed in its original form, social opt-out included, the treaty will be dead. All of these players are bluffing. Labour and the Liberal Democrats will have trouble keeping their most enthusiastic pro-Europeans in line if it looks as if a vote for the social policy amendment will kill the bill. Mr Smith himself does not want to become known as the man who sank the treaty. The Tory Euro-sceptics in the Commons are ducking and weaving in order to keep their opponents - their fellow Conservatives on the government benches  -guessing. Mr Hurd cannot seriously contemplate walking away from the Maastricht treaty. In short you could say that what we have seen this week has been nothing more than a round of parliamentary games. When the vote on Labour's amendment comes, next month or in April, the number of Conservative rebels will be kept below the 11 needed to defeat the government if all opposition MPs turn up and vote the same way. Alternatively, there may be more rebels but the opposition ranks will not hold firm. There is nothing to worry about. This is probably true, but nobody can be sure. A good trimmer always has a contingency plan, as Mr Major demonstrated on November 4. That was the night on which he survived by three votes, bought by a promise to put off the third reading of the Maastricht bill until after the Danish referendum. Better a postponed ratification than no treaty, the foreign secretary explained afterwards, blushing slightly. What Mr Hurd meant was, better a positive vote than no European strategy, no economic strategy, no prime minister and no Conservative government. The same equation will apply if there is a similarly close final vote on the social charter amendment. The prime minister cannot afford to lose. If he did suffer such a calamity he would become Mr John Nothing. His talk of placing Britain at the heart of Europe would sound empty. He would be adrift on the economy, adrift on sterling, adrift on Europe, adrift before the electorate. It is here that my suggestion comes in. The Euro-sceptics would trade their loyalty for a referendum. It is true that Mr Major cannot decently give them the kind of immediate popular veto over ratification that they are asking for. To do so he would have to eat more words than he has been accustomed to consuming at a single sitting. He might choke. So no referendum now. A referendum later, much later, might be easier to swallow. Mr Major could say that the contents of the treaty are too complicated to be expressed as a single question, and that anyhow no serious constitutional issue arises from accepting the treaty as it stands. He would be right. The political arrangements settled at Maastricht do not constitute a step towards a European super-state. The move to economic union is, however, another matter. If Britain does exchange sterling for a single European currency, managed by a single central bank, it will have handed important responsibilities to an outside authority. Maastricht allows Britain to opt in or out of such an arrangement. There is a case for a referendum on that. The vote need not come much before 1996 at the earliest and, the sceptical side of Mr Major may tell himself, it may not happen at all, at least not in the present century. The prime minister would have to say that he could not bind future parliaments, but that his government would recommend a popular vote if the question was whether Britain should enter a single-currency union. If the proposition was put to him this morning, he would reject it. His natural hope must be that there will never again be as close a vote on a European matter as there was on November 4. But suppose there is, and suppose that the clock stands at a few minutes to midnight?</p>

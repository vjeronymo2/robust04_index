			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Lloyd's syndicate is criticised after loss POOR underwriting was to blame for insurance losses at Cuthbert Heath syndicate 1084 in the opinion of a Lloyd's loss review report made available to Names yesterday. Its losses of Pounds 4.4m are small compared with those sustained by larger syndicates such as those managed by Feltrim and Gooda Walker agencies, but they have been a heavy burden for syndicate 1084's Names - the individuals whose assets back underwriting at Lloyd's. Almost 200 Names who supported the syndicate in 1988 face average losses of more than Pounds 20,000 each. Overall, the loss was equal to 142 per cent of the syndicate's capacity, or capital base. The report is the fourth of a series of loss reviews prepared by Lloyd's in the wake of the market's losses in 1988, 1989 and 1990. The report says syndicate 1084's underwriter bought insufficient reinsurance protection and failed to keep proper records or track his exposure to potential losses. As a result, the syndicate was swamped by claims from the Piper Alpha oil platform explosion in July 1988. The use of a financial re-insurance policy bought by the syndicate at the end of 1988 is questioned in the report. It says the policy may have worked to the disadvantage of Names who joined the syndicate in 1989 and afterwards.</p>

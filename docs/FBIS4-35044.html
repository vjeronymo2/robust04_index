			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, 23 Jun (EFE) -- Argentine President  Menem surprised the media in Washington today when he said the  World Trade Organization (WTO) is "a European Community (EC)"  organization, "not an international community" organization.    The blunder occurred during a news conference at the  Argentine Embassy in Washington after a meeting between Menem  and U.S. President Bill Clinton when Menem was asked to clarify  the situation of two Latin American candidacies to head the WTO,  which comprises 111 countries.    Menem explained that during the recent Fourth Ibero-American  summit in Cartagena de Indias (Colombia) his country supported a  Colombian proposal nominating Mexican President Carlos Salinas  de Gortari to head the WTO at the end of his presidential term.    Menem added that at the time he was unaware the Brazilian  Government had proposed Economy Minister Rubens Ricupero, a  veteran diplomat and former Brazilian negotiator at GATT.    The surprise occurred when Menem said it was up to the EU  (Menem insists on calling it "community") to name a president  for the WTO, an organization created to implement GATT  agreements that is expected to become operational next year.    "Of course, it is up to EC members to decide on these  candidacies and (the president) might very well be European,"  Menem said.    Journalists asked why the EC would have the power to choose  the president of the WTO and Menem said: "Because it is an EC  organization."    "It is not a world organization, it is an EC organization,"  Menem insisted despite the organization's name which clearly  identifies it as being global.    "If you have any doubt, I will tell you again," the  Argentine  president repeated to the astonished Brazilian journalist who  asked him to confirm his remarks.    Menem added: "I will clarify things even more: During the  Ibero-American meeting we asked Spain and Portugal to sponsor  Salinas' candidacy. It is an EC organization, not a world  community organization," Menem insisted.    Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella, who was sitting  next to Menem, just put his head in his hands. Argentine  Ambassador Raul Granillo Ocampo, who was sitting next to Menem,  made no attempt to correct him either.</p>

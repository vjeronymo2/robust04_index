			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Capital adequacy It took EC finance ministers until well into Wednesday morning to agree a deal on the so-called Capital Adequacy Directive (CAD) on capital standards for securities houses. But the grounds for disagreement were so many that the compromise negotiated by Portugal represents a significant step forward. The threat to London's broking and underwriting houses appears to have dissolved, principally because brokers will have a 10-day window in which to place large deals without additional capital requirements. All the same, the market will want reassurance on how quickly capital must be allocated once the window closes. The liquidity of London's stock borrowing market has been preserved. Perhaps equally important to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, no other centre has emerged with a notably stronger hand. As to the broader picture, the Commission believes the stalled investment services directive should now gain new impetus. Arguably, it is too early to draw that conclusion. Until it is clear how the CAD will work, the most that can be said is that it represents a useful precedent. Given that Spain and Belgium were reportedly reluctant to the last, even that has its limits. Several technical issues are yet to be resolved. It could take several years before each country has agreed standards in place. The CAD will be reviewed after three years, when it will be judged alongside standards proclaimed by the Basle committee and the securities industry's own lobby. That leaves plenty of scope for changes. It also leaves open the ironic possibility that the UK will introduce harsher capital requirements of its own.</p>

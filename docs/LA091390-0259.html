			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> YANKEES' NEDERLANDER WINS APPROVAL;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: OWNERS UNANIMOUSLY ENDORSE BROADWAY PRODUCER AS STEINBRENNER'S  REPLACEMENT.  </P> <P> Broadway producer Robert Nederlander, promising to bring front office stability  and fiscal sanity to the New York Yankees after George Steinbrenner's 17 1/2  years, was unanimously approved today by major league owners as the team's new  general partner.  </P> <P> The owners ended their quarterly meetings by extending American League  President Dr. Bobby Brown's contract for two years and by more than doubling  the pension benefits of players who retired from 1947 through 1958.  </P> <P> Nederlander backed off criticizing Steinbrenner's free spending on free agents  and revolving-door hirings and firings, but said the Yankees will rebuild the  farm system and "will operate in a fiscally responsible manner."  </P> <P> "We're going to try to field the best team we can and try to bring the pennant  to New York," he said. "In my opinion, with all deference to other clubs, I  believe the New York Yankees franchise is the greatest in the world, and I'm  going to do everything I can to perpetuate that symbol."  </P> <P> Hinting he won't be a headline-seeking, hands-on owner like Steinbrenner,  Nederlander said he won't second-guess General Manager Gene Michael or Manager  Stump Merrill.  </P> <P> "My own personal philosophy is you have to give people a chance, and continuity  is important," he said.  </P> <P> In other news:  </P> <P> Brown will stay on through December, 1992, as the AL board of directors seeks  his replacement. A successor is to be named president-elect by Jan. 1, 1992.  </P> <P> Vincent reported progress in finding new local owners for the Montreal Expos.  </P></p>

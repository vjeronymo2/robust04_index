			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Angola devalues nearly 30% Angola devalued its official exchange rate by nearly 30 per cent yesterday, the third devaluation in the past two weeks. Reuter reports from Luanda. The National Bank of Angola said the official rate of the kwanza was now 24,970 to the dollar, compared to 17,838 in force since February 21 and 12,740 from February 14 when it was cut from 6,500. The devaluation was part of adjusting the official exchange rate to 'a point of macro-economic equilibrium', the bank added. Unita rebels accused Angolan government negotiators of not taking seriously their demands for political power in long-running peace talks to end nearly two decades of civil war. Unita spokesmen said government negotiators had offered it only one governorship out of the 18 provinces, and insignificant ministerial posts.</p>

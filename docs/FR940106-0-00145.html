			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 46.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Training cost limit <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The UAW, commenting on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;617.22(b), pointed out that the Conference Committee rejected a proposed $4000 per worker limit on training costs, stating that ``it is inappropriate to establish a ceiling on training and related costs for individual workers since such costs may vary significantly from one region of the country to another and from one worker dislocation to another.'' The Department cannot give the States the authority to do indirectly what the Congress decided it would not let the Department do directly. The UAW recommended that this proposal should be dropped. The UCSP provided similar comments. The MESC also commented that it is contradictory to require States to establish a single maximum amount and then indicate that States should take into consideration the type of occupational training, duration of training, etc. The different types of training and varying durations render a single maximum cost meaningless. By applying &sect;617.22(a)(6)(iv)(B), there will be sufficient cost control. Section 617.22(a)(6)(iv)(B) requires comparison of training similar in quality, content and results at different training facilities, and approval of the lowest cost training. Also, the ODHR recommended that more guidelines are needed in order to define the ``maximum amount allowable for the total costs of training.'' Specifically, ODHR is concerned with overcoming inequities in setting an amount both for individuals in a rural area without training facilities and for individuals in an urban area with training facilities. The ODHR asked if it is the intent for the maximum amount allowable, because the cost of subsistence or mileage is part of the cost of training, to limit the kinds or duration of training for individuals in rural areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The Department agrees with the comments and is amending this section by eliminating the requirement that States establish, annually, a maximum amount allowable for the total cost of training for each worker. While the Congress did not establish a national ceiling for the costs of training for individual workers, the Conferees did state in the Conference Report that they expected the Secretary of Labor to set forth guidelines for State administering agencies to provide approved training at the lowest reasonable cost for the particular type of training in that region consistent with the objective of assisting import impacted workers to obtain suitable skills to return to work as quickly as possible. The 1988 Amendments clearly provide that State administering agencies shall approve training for individual workers at the lowest reasonable cost which will lead to employment and will result in training opportunities for the largest number of adversely affected workers. This means that State administering agencies should avoid approving training for occupations that require an extraordinarily high skill level relative to the worker's current skills level and for which total costs of training, including transportation and subsistence, are excessively high. While the final regulations eliminate the requirement for States to establish a maximum amount allowable for the total costs of training, they continue to provide that States approve training at the lowest reasonable cost for the particular type of training in that region that will lead to employment and will enable the worker to obtain employment within a reasonable period of time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 47.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Child care <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The WESD, commenting on &sect;617.22, stated it believed that child care is equally important as transportation and subsistence to include as a cost of training. The WESD recommended that child care be included under the definition for supportive services, as is transportation and subsistence. The WESD states that the 1981 Amendments do not permit self-financed training and require TAA or other Federal, State, or private sources to ``pay the full costs of the training.'' Washington contends that the lack of child care would, in fact, require self payment of training costs and it should be included as part of the reasonable costs of training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Section 236(b) authorizes transportation and subsistence expenses applicable to training. Child care is a supportive service to be obtained for individuals under section 235 of the Act (and &sect;617.21(e)), and is not a training cost in the TAA program. Funds for the administration of sections 225, 231 through 235, 243 and 244 of the Trade Act are appropriated in the State Unemployment Insurance and Employment Service Operations (SUIESO) account. The SUIESO account includes funds for the administration of section 235 activities but not for the direct payment of supportive services for certified individuals. Since child care is a supportive service authorized by section 235 to be provided if available under ``any other Federal law'', no TAA funds are appropriated for such services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department's position is that the State administering agency, in carrying out its responsibilities under section 235 and &sect;617.21(e), should make every reasonable effort to secure for adversely affected workers covered by a certification any supportive services, including child care, which are obtainable under any other Federal law, to help individuals in training and to obtain employment. No change is made in the regulations, but &sect;617.21 is amended to make clear that supportive services are to be provided under other Federal law and may include child care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

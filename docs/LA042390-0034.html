			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WASHINGTON INSIGHT  </P> <P> NEW ENVIRONMENT: When President Bush chose him to head the Environmental  Protection Agency, William K. Reilly was considered a nonpartisan, patrician  defender of the earth and all its creatures. Conservatives viewed him  suspiciously.  </P> <P> No more. Now Reilly is giving sharply partisan stump speeches, winning cheers  from audiences, such as the recent Southern Republican Leadership Conference in  Raleigh, N.C.  </P> <P> Democratic criticisms, Reilly thundered, are "the actions of a party that  doesn't expect to be back in power anytime soon." Bush, he said, is "taking  back the issue of the environment and he's driving some Democrats crazy."  </P> <P> QUORUM CALL: Congress can't seem to act on the Administration's $300-million  aid request to help Nicaragua's spring planting. But it's sending the next best  thing -- lots of congressmen.  </P> <P> When Violetta Chamorro is inaugurated Tuesday as Nicaragua's new President, at  least 25 members of Congress, a half-dozen sub-Cabinet members and dozens of  other officials will fly down from Washington, all led by Vice President Dan  Quayle. "The limiting factor turned out to be how many people we could fit on  Quayle's plane," one official said.  </P> <P> "There is a certain irony" in the failure to pass the aid, a State Department  official noted. "Of course, we are confident that Congress will do the right  thing . . . eventually, anyway."  </P> <P> BETTER READ THAN RED? Rita Klimova, ambassador of the newly democratic  Czechoslovakian government, sends out letters on old embassy letterhead  emblazoned: "The Ambassador of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic" -- with the  word "Socialist" crossed out by hand.  </P> <P> YEN TO TRAVEL: President Bush's incessant travels are causing some changes in  the White House press corps. With Bush traveling about one day in three,  newspapers with only one White House correspondent are having trouble keeping  up. Moreover, as the newspaper industry struggles with sharp declines in  advertising revenue, many have decided full-time coverage of the President is  simply too expensive. Besides, many of Bush's trips simply do not produce any  news.  </P> <P> The net result: roughly a 30% decline in the number of reporters following Bush  over the last year. But as American reporters drop off the presidential press  plane, some are being replaced by correspondents for Japanese papers: At least  three now cover Bush full time.  </P> <P> DELUGE: Unhappy with some details of a new Democratic spending blueprint during  a House Budget Committee hearing, Rep. Jack Buechner (R-Mo.) sought to drive  home his point by recalling the biblical story of Noah's Ark, in which all the  animals went aboard Noah's vessel two-by-two, including a pair of skunks.  </P> <P> "There may be a couple of skunks in this ark," Buechner declared, "but our job  is to get it to float. You guys got your way of launching the ark, and we got  ours, but the important thing is that the ship of state remain afloat."  </P></p>

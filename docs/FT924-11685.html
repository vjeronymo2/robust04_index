			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Gardening: Amateur advice at the experts' expense - Robin Lane Fox has been taking his pot plants indoors in order to outwit the wise old owls in his garden IN BROAD DAYLIGHT, the owls have been hooting in my garden. By daytime, an owl-hoot means death, death for Shakespearian heroes, deadly omens for classical generals and something nasty for columnists who have been much too slow to plant their tulips. I have been checking for fire blight and have feared honey fungus: I now know why they were hooting. They were moping for my half-hardy heliotropes and other tender plants in pot, but I have outwitted them by taking the plants indoors before the frosts. This year, nobody could grudge their half-hardy plants a long warm rest. They have flourished in pots but none have flourished more than these scented heliotropes. Ten varieties are listed in The Plant Finder, from Chatsworth to Lord Roberts: mine is the 11th, White Swan, a heliotrope which has pale mauve flowers and a scent straight from warm French heaven. Heliotrope is also known as cherry pie. Its scent combines powder and chocolate and softens the insensitivity of bedding out in France. If you want the real thing, you need to beg some cuttings from a named form during the next fortnight when their owners bring them under shelter. Varieties from a seed packet have none of the scent and delicacy of the true old Edwardian beauties. Like most of the best things in pots, these plants are not hardy and so you have to follow October discipline. Last week's frost took out the weaker members of the garden unless you had anticipated it. Perhaps you still have fuchsias, verbenas, white penstemons or any of those trailing plants with silver leaves: if so, put them in a frost-proof shed immediately, or else my owls will be proved right. If you are putting a large plant or semi-shrub to rest, cut it back quite hard and see that it is soaked heavily in water before resting in its new home. By cutting it hard, you encourage those first green shoots which every economist is hoping to see nowadays. I prefer to leave these young shoots on the plant and only take them as cuttings in early spring: some books suggest that you should root them immediately and leave them in the same pot until March. I find that they rot more often than not. Each year, gardening in pots tests the wisdom of the handbooks and throws up new possibilities. I have learned to follow rules which were being ignored ten years ago in dictionaries: they are still being ignored in the RHS's new Dictionary of Gardening. They originate from amateur gardeners who have a sharp eye for decoration and are not merely horticulturalists. Their main rule is simple: pack in many more plants than any expert dares to tell you in print. Begin with a pot at least 2 ft wide and into it you can pack a dozen different varieties. They all tangle together and defy the usual wisdom so long as they are heavily fed and watered. This year, the reason why the heliotropes were so good is surely that I planted them in almost nothing but animal manure. As the season ends, I can also endorse the use of water-retaining crystals or jelly, mixed into the compost when you plant it. The Swel-gel really worked and I found myself watering some very heavy plantings only twice a week, a bearable routine. With the last of summer out of the way, the field is then clear to break the rules with bulbs. Once again, the books and the RHS dictionary are behind the times: they do not tell you to plant your bulbs in layers. To my intense surprise, this method works. It allows you to put the tulips about nine inches deep on the bottom layer and then plant a second storey of narcissi about three inches above them and then round off near the rooftops with a layer of crocusses just near the surface of the soil. Like the traffic on a main street in Naples, they somehow manage to queue without signals and move forwards without colliding. The crocusses flower first; the narcissi then nose their way between them and eventually, the late-flowering tulips emerge through the jungle. In one pot, you can enjoy three seasons: they are not cheap but they are much more fun than an ordinary old pot full of scillas. Once again, amateurs have discovered a trick which the experts ignored for years. Gardening in pots brings the best out of private ingenuity; pack the bulbs in, layer upon layer, like passengers on the London Underground. They give you three gardens in once space: this time, it is a real hoot, yours at the expert's expense.</p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWPORT ELECTRONICS ACCEPTS OFFER BY SENSOR CONTROL  </P> <P> Just 2 days after Chairman Barret B. Weekes offered to buy Newport Electronics  Inc. for $10 million, the Santa Ana company's directors fell into the arms of  another suitor who had earlier offered the same price.  </P> <P> That suitor is Sensor Control Corp., an aggressive Silicon Valley manufacturer  of heat and pressure sensors that run machines on factory assembly lines.  </P> <P> Newport Electronics makes the meters used to "read" information from sensors,  including some of the devices that Sensor Control manufactures.  </P> <P> If the deal goes through, it would be Sensor Control's fourth acquisition in 3  years.  </P> <P> The offer values Newport Electronics, with 1.1 million shares outstanding, at  nearly $10 million -- a handsome price for a stock that had not traded for more  than $5.50 in the year before Sensor Control made its offer.  </P> <P> Sensor Control had first offered $8 a share in December but informally raised  the offer to $9 early last week, both companies said.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Weekes too offered $9 a share after discussing his offer with  seven other company officers.  </P> <P> Weekes, who owns 20% of the stock, abstained Saturday when Newport directors  voted unanimously to accept Sensor Control's offer, said Director Norman Gray,  a consultant to the company. That vote behind them, the board took no action on  Weekes' offer.  </P> <P> Weekes -- who is also chief executive and president of the company -- did not  return a call Monday after Newport Electronics announced the deal.  </P> <P> The sale to Sensor Control is contingent on the company obtaining financing by  March 3. The agreement signed Saturday also provides for a breakup fee of  $300,000 for Sensor if Newport accepts a higher offer for its shares.  </P> <P> Sensor Control already has a lender lined up but no firm commitment. Still,  that was enough to give it a leg up on Weekes' offer, Gray said.  </P> <P> "The board felt his timing was too late," he said. "Sensor's initial offer was  made in December, and they had a loan commitment from a major lender, even  though it was conditional."  </P> <P> Yet another suitor, which offered $8.50 a share shortly after Sensor Control  made its first offer of $8, said it is now out of the running.  </P> <P> InterVen Partners of Los Angeles, whose $8.50 offer expired earlier, said  Monday it would not make a higher offer for Newport.  </P> <P> A venture capital firm, InterVen thought Newport Electronics stock was a deal  last year when it was trading at $4 a share on the over-the-counter market, or  only 70% of the value carried on the company's own books. InterVen approached  Newport Electronics about a buyout that would take the company private.  </P> <P> Newport Electronics reported sales through the third quarter of $13 million;  sales were $11.1 million last year. It expects to end the year with about $16  million in sales. But the company said higher expenses this year knocked  earnings down to $499,000, from $569,000.  </P> <P> Sensor Control, based in Sunnyvale, is less than half the size of Newport  Electronics, with sales of $5 million for the fiscal year that ended in the  middle of last year. That was up from $3.7 million the year before. But much of  the boost in sales last year actually came from a new company Sensor Control  bought.  </P> <P> Profits were a very respectable $529,000 last year, but that was a drop from  $885,000 the year before. Sensor Control had to write off $300,000 it spent  last year when it gave up a hostile takeover of a New Jersey company.  </P> <P> Few changes are planned for Newport Electronics, Sensor Control President Jim  Hawkins said, but he answered with a "no comment" when asked whether Weekes  would stay on.  </P> <P> "He's a fine guy, and it's obviously a fine company, and that's all I really  want to say," Hawkins said.  </P></p>

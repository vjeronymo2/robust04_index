			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> ARIZONA ASSISTANT RON MCBRIDE HIRED AS FOOTBALL COACH AT UTAH  </P> <P> Ron McBride, a 50-year-old coaching veteran serving as an Arizona assistant,  says he has been chosen to take the helm of the University of Utah football  program.  </P> <P> McBride, an assistant coach for 26 years -- including stints at Utah from 1977  to '82 and in 1985 and '86 -- replaces Jim Fassel, who was fired last month.  McBride will be Utah's 15th head football coach.  </P> <P> University officials planned a formal announcement at a mid-afternoon news  conference. However, McBride confirmed he had been told he had the job.  </P> <P> "It's a job I've always wanted," McBride said. "It's a great time to go there.  They haven't played very good defense for the last several years, and it's just  a great opportunity for me. I think it's a great job."  </P> <P> Washington assistant Keith Gilbertson was the runner-up. He and McBride visited  the Utah campus for interviews earlier this week.  </P> <P> McBride joined the Arizona staff in 1987 as offensive line coach, when Dick  Tomey took over for Larry Smith as head coach. Before Arizona, he had served as  an assistant at Utah, Wisconsin, Cal State Long Beach, San Jose State and UC  Riverside.  </P></p>

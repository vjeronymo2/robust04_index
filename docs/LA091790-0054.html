			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> CAFETERIAS TASTEFULLY REVAMPED  </P> <P> For generations, school cafeteria food has been the butt of campus jokes. Tuna  Surprise may be nutritious, but it doesn't sell well.  </P> <P> But lunches in the Newport-Mesa Unified School District these days are a little  different. In an effort to compete for the lunch money of students accustomed  to eating at fast-food restaurants, the district has opened "food pavilions" in  its high school cafeterias. Now a student can buy pizza, salad or a stuffed  potato without having to leave campus.  </P> <P> "We're trying to meet the needs and wants of the students," said Jackie  Kravitz, assistant food services director for the district. "The menu reflects  food in the '90s."  </P> <P> The cafeterias resemble the food courts found in malls, with individual  stations for each type of food.  </P> <P> And the students seem to agree with the changes. The lunch lines at Estancia  High School last week were packed.  </P> <P> "I used to go off campus last year, but not any more," said 18-year-old R.C.  Arce, adding that the pizza and Mexican food were his favorites. "This is what  you'd choose to eat, if you could."  </P> <P> "There's a variety of foods to choose from now, not just one food," said  15-year-old Naazma Malik. "Last year a lot of people just brought their lunch  'cause they didn't like the sight of the food."  </P> <P> The district also plans to introduce pushcarts with hot dogs and Chinese food  and an outdoor grill for hamburgers, Estancia supervisor Jean Mechem said.  </P> <P> Now, Kravitz said, "if they don't want peas, they don't have to have peas. But  this is food they'll eat. Why make a nice nutritious trash can?"  </P> <P> The goal of the new program is to increase revenues. The food services  department, with an annual budget of about $3 million, cost the district about  $250,00 last year, according to Assistant Supt. Thomas Godley. With an increase  in prices of about 15% and the increased participation of students, the  district hopes that it can make up that loss.  </P> <P> But seniors at one table said the new fare would not be enough to keep them at  school during the lunch hour.  </P> <P> "Well, the decorations are really funky," said Shannon Curren, 17, "but we  prefer to eat out. Let's just put it that way."  </P> <P> "It's more fun to go out, and to get a break from school," Kristen Hall, 17,  added. LAURA MICHAELIS  </P></p>

NMFS implemented parts of Amendment 5 to the FMP on March 1, 1994, but delayed implementation of some provisions, including the effort-reduction program, until May 1, to provide the industry and NMFS sufficient time to prepare for this unprecedented and far-reaching change to the regulations. The effect of this delay is that the first-year's effort reduction requirements are compressed into eight months with different impacts on different segments of the fleet. The adjustment in the fishing year implemented by this rule will establish May 1 through April 30 as the annual fishing year for the effort reduction program contained in Amendment 5. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  May 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Copies of Amendment 5, its regulatory impact review (RIR) and the final regulatory flexibility analysis contained within the RIR, its final supplemental environmental impact statement, and Framework Adjustment  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> 1 are available upon request from Douglas G.

The primary purpose of Amendment 5 is to eliminate the overfished condition of the primary stocks of the multispecies complex through an effort-reduction program. The effort-reduction program consists of annual reductions in the numbers of days that vessels are allowed to spend at sea as a method to limit fishing effort for groundfish. Vessels have a choice whether to fish under an individual allocation of days-at-sea (DAS), based on each vessel's history of fishing for groundfish, or to fish under the fleet DAS option, wherein vessels must declare blocks of time out of the fishery and lay over in port for a period proportional to the time fishing for groundfish.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS published the proposed rule for Amendment 5 on October 27, 1993 (58 FR 57774), and informed the Council on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 3, 1994, that Amendment 5 had been approved. At that time, the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director) indicated that the expected implementation date for the amendment was to be March 1, 1994. The Council immediately realized that the implementation of this comprehensive amendment would require NMFS' starting a number of new administrative programs. The Council acknowledged the procedural and administrative difficulties and stated that it wanted NMFS to implement the effort-reduction program only when the agency was ready. The Council also communicated its intent that Amendment 5's effort-reduction program be implemented on a full-year basis, rather than on a part-year basis for the first year, and initiated Framework Adjustment  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1 on February 16 to adjust the final rule for Amendment 5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council is making this adjustment to the final rule for Amendment 5 (59 FR 9872, March 1, 1994) under the framework abbreviated rulemaking procedure established by Amendment 5 and contained in 50 CFR part 651, subpart C. This procedure requires the Council, when making certain adjustments to the FMP, to develop and analyze the actions over the span of at least two Council meetings. The Council provides the public with advance notice of both the proposals and the analysis and an opportunity to comment on them prior to and at the second Council meeting. Upon review of the analysis and public comment, the Council may recommend to the Regional Director that the measures of a given framework adjustment be published as a final rule, if certain conditions are met. The Regional Director may publish the measures as a final rule, or as a proposed rule if additional public comment is needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

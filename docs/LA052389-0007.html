			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Without discussion, the San Diego City Council on Monday passed a resolution  urging the federal government to close the Virginia Street border crossing and  consolidate all commercial traffic at an expanded Otay Mesa border crossing.  </P> <P> The move is supported by San Ysidro community groups concerned about traffic,  noise, safety and pollution caused by southbound truck traffic, but is opposed  by businesses near the Virginia Street crossing, according to a report from the  city's Intergovernmental Relations Department.  </P> <P> The U. S. Customs Service plans to expand the Otay Mesa crossing, where  northbound commercial traffic now crosses the international border and where  the bulk of industrial development is occurring. However, the agency is  attempting to determine whether the Mexican government will enlarge its side of  the Otay Mesa crossing before proceeding, the report says.  </P> <P> In the meantime, southbound trucks continue to use the Virginia Street  crossing, which could remain open at least two years while the two governments  reach agreement on the Otay Mesa expansion.  </P></p>

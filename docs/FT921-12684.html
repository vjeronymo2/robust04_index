			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar steady ahead of G7 The dollar remained the focus of a tense day on the foreign exchange markets, maintaining a tight range against both the yen and the D-Mark ahead of this weekend's meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven countries, writes Simon London. Although rumours of possible central bank intervention on Wednesday failed to materialise, dealers were unwilling to test the US and Japanese authorities determination to cap the value of the dollar. However, there were few natural sellers of the US currency, leading to an uneasy stalemate. The dollar was confined to a very tight range overnight in the Far East. The US unit closed at Y123.23 and DM1.5900 in Tokyo, from Y123.35 and DM1.8595 in New York. The Y123 resistence was tested several times but the yen was unable to break through. Many analysts are still expecting an appreciation of the Japanese currency to Y120 before the end of this month. There is speculation that the G7 meeting will back a stronger yen as a means of capping the large Japanese trade surplus. In European trading the restricted pattern continued with US currency rising against the D-Mark but remaining within its established range, reaching DM1.5942 early in London before softening. The US currency closed in London at DM1.5950 from DM1.5875 on Wednesday; Y123.85 from Y123.20; and Pounds 1.7960 from Pounds 1.8070. However, shortly after the London market had closed the dollar rallied sharply, breaking through DM1.60. Stop-loss trading orders were triggered and the US currency briefly touched DM1.6155 and Y124.45 before falling back. Dealers were unwilling to ascribe significance to the short-lived rally. There were reports that an order to buy dollars against the Swiss franc started the move in thin US trading. With the dollar subdued, attention also focussed on the yen/D-Mark cross exchange rate. The German currency closed at Y77.68 in Tokyo, having tested resistence at Y77.00 but proved resilient. During European trading the D-Mark rose to Y77.80 until the late rally of the dollar in New York pushed it back down to Y77.35. Within the European exchange rate mechanism, sterling gained most against the D-Mark during the morning session, rising to a high of DM2.8750. Analysts said that the rise was backed by expectations of tax cuts to stimulate the UK economy when 1991 budget measures are announced on March 10. However, trading in sterling remains driven by political factors, including the weekly round of opinion polls published in Sunday newspapers. Dealers commented that they were wary of holding long sterling positions over the weekend. By the close the UK currency had fallen back to DM2.8650, from DM2.8675 on Wednesday.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Luis Acevedo and Marcos Chavez] </F>   [Text] Government optimism based on a modest increase in  the gross national product [GNP] in the first quarter of 1994  offers cosmetic economic growth with the apparent intent of not  impeding electoral goals. Nevertheless, facts indicate serious  signs of deterioration in production investment, domestic sales,  the inability to generate jobs, and a growing deficit in the  foreign sector.    According to the SHCP [Secretariat of Finance and Public  Credit], Banco de Mexico, INEGI [National Institute of  Geography, Statistics, and Data], IMSS [Mexican Social Security  Institute], and various private organizations, 130,000 paying  jobs were lost between January and March. The development of  various productive sectors is still heterogeneous, with an  average unemployment rate of 70 percent. The trade balance  deficit grew 18 percent, and businesses in general are facing  heavy financial burdens resulting from an increase in interest  rates.    The following sectors, which collectively contribute 68  percent of the GNP in manufacturing, have remained in recession:  food production, the textiles industry, lumber, printing,  chemical production, and the nonmetallic minerals production.    As if this were not enough, prevailing conditions are not  ripe for a 5-percent inflation target by year's end, even though  consumer prices have been the lowest in a long time. Up until  the first half of May, 58 percent of the overall inflation goal  had already been attained.    Nevertheless, there is an assurance a firm monetary  management will prevent the transition of public administration  from incurring serious problems as in the past, particularly  because no presidential candidate has advocated a modification  of the structural indicators of the economic strategy.    The 0.5-percent growth in the GNP between January and March  does not guarantee the economy can overcome the prevailing  recession or that it can reinitiate a sustained growth that  could dampen any electoral expectation. Financial authorities  have presented this position as a departure from the poor  performance during the last quarter of 1993.    There are signs suggesting the hoped-for economic  reactivation possibly ran out of steam during the second  quarter, and with great difficulty it could progress by more  than one half of a percentage point. Under the best of  circumstances, economic growth could be 1 percent during 1994.    During most of the first quarter of the year, mild economic  conditions prevailed, reflecting the overall results of official  statistics, but that does not demonstrate the economy's real  condition.    Up until the end of March, inflation and interest rates were  low; the exchange rate remained below the limit of the top  floating ceiling; domestic and foreign demand was slightly  reactivated, and the domino effect resulting from the increase  in public spending boosted several economic sectors. Moreover,  investment recovered in January.    This is why the sectors that demonstrated the best  performance were geared toward countries abroad while  traditional economic activities are still in a recession or a  structural crisis.    As analysts of the TENDENCIAS ECONOMICAS Y FINANCIERAS have  indicated, the economic setback resulting from the  sociopolitical situation at the end of March will be felt during  the second quarter of the year, despite definite stability in  the financial and exchange markets.    The peso already suffered a 6-percent devaluation with  regard  to the dollar in May.    The transfer of foreign capital passed from Treasury  Certificates to Treasury Bonds. The flight of capital was  checked, but it also revealed a mistrust in the exchange rate.  The cost of credits rose almost 100 percent, and domestic and  foreign investments were reduced.    Many companies are suffering from a loss in demand and  revenues due to the high cost of financing and losses in the  exchange rate.    The economic expectations for the third and fourth quarters  are no better. Pre- and post electoral uncertainty could hinder  the hoped-for economic recovery.    Despite minor growth, the trade deficit accumulated a  balance  of $4.29 billion between January and March, 18.9 percent higher  than the same period in 1993 when the economy expanded 2.4  percent. At this pace, the trade imbalance could close at the  end of the year at approximately $16 billion.    The SHCP, as stated in its Report on the Public Economic and  Financial Situation, maintains that since November, "there have  been continued signs coinciding with the first phase of the  expansive stage in the economic cycles," meaning "we are on the  right road, headed for the" programmed "goals."    Official optimism is based on low prices and a 0.5-percent  increase in the GNP, supported by an improvement in certain  activities. This is particularly true of those activities  oriented toward countries abroad and the construction industry,  as well as the appropriate management of public finances, among  other factors.    Nevertheless, the private sector no longer presents carefree  accounts. For Banamex [National Bank of Mexico], recovery is  not clear, while there are factors that could delay and limit  it. Investment projects could be postponed. Low consumption  could lead to an increase in inventories and a decrease in  production.    Meanwhile, Bancomer [Bank of Commerce] has adjusted its GNP  forecast to 1.8 percent with a 7.5-percent inflation rate.  Bancomer believes growth will be tangible toward the third  quarter, as long as economic stability and political assurance  prevail.    For the stock company Vector, coinciding with the stock  company Probursa and with the Industrial Promotion Office, the  panorama is not as favorable as it was in November. These  investment firms suggest businesses plan strategies for the  short and long term.    For the investment company InverMexico, "political  uncertainty, high interest rates, and the exchange rate will  most likely influence a new slowdown in investment, productive  activity, and consumption." Thus, slow growth is expected for  the first six months and up to the fourth quarter when  reactivation is confirmed. The annual GNP is presently 1.5  percent, half of what was originally forecast. Meanwhile,  TENDENCIAS ECONOMICAS Y FINANCIERAS forecasts a 1-percent GNP.  INEGI and Bank of Mexico data justify a cautious position.    Except for public and investment accounts, which increased  5.2 percent in January, supported by factors of the construction  sector, equipment, and imported machinery, other indicators have  deviated from their goals.    Despite slow growth in domestic demand (consumption and  investment), accumulated inflation has deviated from its fixed  goal.    Prices in May were recorded at 2.84 percent as opposed to a  2.1-percent variation required to attain an annual rate of 5  percent, indicative of a 56.8-percent increase and not the 42  percent required to close the year with a 5-percent rate.  Inflationary deviation will be no greater than the established  target thanks to its effect on money expenditures, investment,  and production.    The modest improvement in the GNP during the first quarter,  much lower than the growth in population, cannot be considered  as too encouraging, given it is highly uneven, unsuitable to  encourage more employment, and spurred by a growing trade  deficit.    Growth was observed only in the transportation and financial  sectors, as well as in other activities such as mining,  construction, electricity, basic metals, machinery and  equipment, manufacturing, and assembly plant industries.    In February, there was a slight drop in annual accumulated  production in the mining, construction, electricity, assembly  plants, machinery, and other manufacturing sectors.    A recession continued in the food, textiles, lumber,  printing, chemicals and nonmetallic mining industries, which  contribute nearly 68 percent to GNP manufacturing.    Average unemployment in the manufacturing industry dropped  significantly during the first quarter: 27.1 percent as opposed  to 27.6 percent during the same period in 1993.    Recovery in this sector was accompanied by a drop in  employment in activities such as wholesale trade, assembly plant  industries, and manufacturing.    Thus, IMSS beneficiaries dropped 1.3 percent and the average  unemployment rate during the month of March increased to 3.8  percent. Nearly 81,370 jobs were lost in the construction  sector between December 1993 and February 1994.    The drop in sales could become a serious obstacle to  production. On average, wholesale activity fell 1.2 percent,  while retail fell 5.9 percent. This drop in demand affects  mostly activities such as food, textiles, paper and pulp,  petrochemicals, and others.</p>

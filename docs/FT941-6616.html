			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Observer: Gaijin clubs What do the J-League - Japan's football league launched last year - and the country's stock market have in common? It seems neither can thrive without gaijin - foreigner - support. The J-League is now a huge craze, but its stars are foreign players from South America and Europe. Similarly, the real players behind this year's near 15 per cent rise in the Nikkei stock index are US and European buyers. A record Dollars 12bn in overseas funds was pumped into the Tokyo stock market in January alone. Which craze will pass first? While Japan's football teams are happy to rely on foreign players, some xenophobic financial authorities are starting to worry about what happens when the foreigners stop buying. They can 'guide' Japanese institutions when to buy or sell, but gaijin investors can't be pushed around like foreign football stars. Well, not yet, anyway.</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Redwood picks joint venture developments A NEW AIRPORT for Sheffield, a power station for London's Docklands and a bridge across the Tyne are among 21 development projects identified yesterday by the government as candidates for joint ventures between private investors and public authorities. The projects, costing more than Pounds 1bn, were identified by Mr John Redwood, environment minister, in an effort to persuade construction companies and banks to take advantage of Treasury rule changes which make it easier to raise private finance for infrastructure developments. The changes, announced in the Autumn Statement, mean that public subsidies may be used to supplement private investment in schemes which otherwise might not go ahead. Treasury guidelines, stipulating that private-sector schemes could proceed only if they were cheaper than public-sector proposals, have also been relaxed. Many of the schemes proposed by Mr Redwood would involve handing over publicly owned land for commercial development to private investors. Companies would be able to use profits from property developments to help pay for infrastructure investments. Mr Redwood said that in other cases private investment would be supplemented by local authority capital receipts and the existing Pounds 600m-a-year urban development corporation, urban partnership and City Challenge budgets. He said that at least one British financial institution was considering launching an 'infrastructure investment fund' to take advantage of new opportunities. He expected the ratio of private to public investment to be much greater than 'the normal four-to-one or five-to-one'. In some cases schemes might be financed totally by the private sector. Mr Redwood will outline his proposals to senior construction company executives later this month. The plans include a Pounds 55m Sheffield airport. A private investor would build and operate the airport and receive 50 acres of land for a business park from the Sheffield Development Corporation. A private developer of a Pounds 100m road tunnel under the Tyne would be allowed to use tolls from the existing tunnel to help pay for construction. The deal would be similar to arrangements used for the Dartford Bridge across the Thames. Mr Redwood said the developer of a Pounds 200m shopping centre at Trafford Park in Manchester, approved last week by Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, might be prepared to help fund a Pounds 60m extension to the Manchester Metrolink.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> O. Revision of &sect;617.50(d) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 617.50(d) contains the rules on the use of State law and regulations in making and reviewing determinations and redeterminations under part 617. Questions have arisen in at least two States whether the 210-day time limit in &sect;617.15(b) (and section 233(b) of the Act) may be waived for good cause, or whether State law provisions on good cause for late filing of UI claims may be applied. The Department has consistently taken the position that such good cause provisions may not be applied, in view of the lack of authority for doing so in any provision of the Act or the regulations. Nevertheless, State authorities in one State have ruled a number of times that there can be good cause for late filing. And more recently, in a matter arising in another State, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a decision adverse to the position of the Department. Because the Department believes that conclusions inconsistent with its longstanding position do not comport with the Act, it has decided to address the issue in a broad manner and state as clearly as possible in the regulations the precise situations in which State laws may be applicable in addressing issues arising under the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Sixth Circuit's decision started with the proposition that the Trade Act of 1974 was passed by the Congress ``during a mood of congressional largesse,'' and that the 210-day rule in section 233(b) of the Act ``was not intended to act as a jurisdictional prerequisite to additional TRA benefits.'' From this premise it reasoned that ``the purpose of the rule is to discourage dilatory'' conduct by applicants, and that absent a finding of dilatory conduct ``the application of the 210-day rule does nothing to further the Act's remedial purpose and everything to frustrate it''. Citing another holding in the District of Columbia Circuit, the Sixth Circuit held that the Department's ``interpretation makes sense only if there was a congressional policy in favor of limiting TRA benefits.'' The Sixth Circuit concluded that: ``That court found no evidence of such a policy. Nor do we.'' From this line of reasoning the Sixth Circuit held that the State's ``waiver for good cause rule [is applicable] in this context''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department believes the Sixth Circuit erred in relying upon the ``mood of congressional largesse'' in passing the 1974 Act, without taking into account the critical redirection in the 1981 amendments away from TRA and towards greater emphasis upon training (including changing the 233(b) rule from 180 days to 210 days), and the direct linkage in the 1988 Amendments of training and eligibility for basic TRA (as well as additional TRA). In this context, there is a sound reason for upholding the ``jurisdictional'' nature of the 210-day rule, and less reason for reaching out to State law for a good cause exception, as distinguished from fashioning an exception from the language of Section 233(b). For these reasons, the Department believes the Sixth Circuit's decision was incorrect. The Department is therefore moving to clarify the regulations to make its interpretation of the Act clearer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Establishing the facts I have two questions on capital gains tax. 1. I hold shares in a company that went into receivership in 1991 and was declared (or so I understand from a circular the company sent me) of nil value by the Inland Revenue. Can I index the losses to the date when the Revenue declared them nil value (this was before the Budget)? 2. I hold shares in two companies from the early 1980s. Both were registered in Amsterdam and both have 'disappeared from the scene,' probably because they were fraudulent. Am I entitled to indexation on these losses? 1. If the company was still in existence on November 30 last year, then you will get no indexation allowance at all, as you will see from the free Budget press release 1R28 (obtainable from the Inland Revenue Public Enquiry Room, Somerset House, Strand, London, WC2R 1LB). In saying this, we are assuming that you mean you did not submit a negligible-value claim (under section 24(2) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992) before Budget day. On the other hand, if the company was struck off (or otherwise ceased to exist) before November 30, you will get indexation allowance up to the day of striking-off (or extinction), and the indexed loss will be deemed to have accrued on that day, by virtue of section 24(1). This says that 'the occasion of the . . . extinction of an asset shall, for the purposes of this Act, constitute a disposal of the asset.' 2. If the companies were fictitious, then you will get no loss relief at all (because what you lost was sterling, which is outside the scope of CGT, presumably). If the companies were real, then the answer is the same as to question 1. In practice, of course, the cost of trying to establish the facts to the satisfaction of the Inland Revenue (or, on appeal, the General or Special Commissioners, ) could be prohibitive. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

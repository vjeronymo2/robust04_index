			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Emu marathon a stiff test of Greek stamina FOR GREECE, the path to economic convergence with its European partners resembles a marathon course over a boulder-strewn mountainside. After a decade of economic mismanagement, the country's chances of catching up with the rest of the Community by 1997, depend on deep spending cuts to bring the public sector debt from an estimated 140 per cent of gross domestic product this year to the Maastricht target of under 60 per cent. The adjustment will be painful, says Mr Stefanos Manos, economy minister. The first draft of Greece's convergence plan calls for abolishing 40,000 public sector jobs (about 8 per cent of the total payroll) by 1994 and freezing pension payments for the next five years. The plan also proposes a one percentage point cut in real wages each year until 1997, and postponement of income tax reductions included in a bill now before parliament. The overall aim is to achieve savings of Dr200bn (Pounds 570m) a year over the next five years, according to government advisers. Besides lowering the debt, these measures should reduce the public sector deficit, which totalled 16 per cent of GDP last year, to the 3 per cent level required for Emu participation. The Greek inflation rate, at 16 per cent, is three times the Community average. But it appears to be on a steady downward trend, suggesting that the drachma will be able to join the wide band of the exchange rate mechanism by 1994. Greece would then stand a reasonable chance of meeting the Emu criterion of an inflation rate no more than 1.5 per cent above the EC's three best performers. Joining Emu at the outset is crucial if Greece is to avoid being permanently relegated to the lower rung of a two-tier Community. Officially, it is already the poorest EC member. In fact, the size of the black economy, now estimated at about 40 per cent of GDP, gives Greeks a standard of living comparable with the Irish. Though Greeks are overwhelmingly in favour of European political and economic union, according to opinion polls, it is not clear how many sacrifices they are ready to make. Public sector unions are already preparing strikes in response to last month's announcement of sweeping reforms of the pension system. Much depends on whether the conservative government can build a consensus on the need to achieve convergence. If the opposition Socialists are willing to accept its costs, in the form of higher unemployment and fewer welfare benefits, the task will be easier. On the other hand, the outlook is considerably brightened by anticipation of increased EC financial support, which would help boost economic growth to 3-3.5 per cent annually. Under the draft convergence plan Greece must maintain a growth rate of at least one point higher than the EC average in order to narrow the gap with its partners. This is an ambitious but not impossible target provided it can obtain the maximum amount of EC funding available. Greek officials speak of receiving about Ecu2.2bn (Pounds 1.53bn) from the 'cohesion fund' for poorer members and Ecu12bn from the existing structural funds by 1997. At present the country has fewer than 50 miles of motorway, a rail network on which express trains average 40mph and a telephone system heavily reliant on east European equipment from the 1960s. 'Rapid modernisation of the infrastructure is a vital part of convergence. Otherwise we don't stand a chance of keeping up,' says a Greek official. Greeks favour EC union, but are they ready to pay the price, asks Kerin Hope</p>

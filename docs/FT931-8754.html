			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Up to one in four may have lost a job since 1990 UP TO one-quarter of the workforce has experienced unemployment since it started rising in early 1990 and almost exactly half the unemployed are now homeowners, according to a Financial Times analysis of government data. These, and other figures, illustrate why unemployment is taking a far heavier toll of economic confidence than in previous recessions, and why the government is urgently considering a package of measures aimed at the 'white collar' jobless to accompany the March 16 Budget. The government will today announce that the raw unemployment total, not adjusted for seasonal variation, has breached the 3m barrier for the second time in a decade. The seasonally adjusted figure will remain just below the 3m mark but today will still be marked by nationwide demonstrations and a lobby of Parliament organised by the Trades Union Congress. The FT analysis has found that 49 per cent of the unemployed own or are still buying their homes compared with 50 per cent who live in rented accommodation - the corresponding figures in 1984 were 42 per cent and 57 per cent. The increase in unemployment among mortgage holders is also illustrated by the government's figures for income support, the main benefit for the unemployed, which covers mortgage interest payments. In 1990 income support was paying out Pounds 544m for mortgage interest. This rose in 1991 to Pounds 949m, almost 10 per cent of the Pounds 10bn which income support spends on the unemployed. Manufacturing continued to lose a far higher proportion of jobs than the service sector between 1989 and 1992 - minus 14 per cent compared with minus 1.5 per cent. But in previous recessions the same 10 to 15 per cent of the workforce moved in and out of employment, whereas unemployment has this time extended much further occupationally and regionally. About 11.3m have joined the unemployment count since April 1990, but up to half of them will have been counted more than once. This still means that around one-quarter of the workforce have been affected and polls show that half of all households fear that a member could become unemployed. The increase in unemployment in the south is also shown by the fact that 35 per cent of the long-term unemployed live there compared with 58 per cent in the north. In 1984 the corresponding figures were 29 per cent and 67 per cent. Nationwide, about 1.5m people have been unemployed for more than six months but one quarter find a job within one month. The white-collar and qualified component of the unemployed has increased since 1984 when 50 per cent of the unemployed had no qualifications - that figure was down to 35 per cent by 1992.

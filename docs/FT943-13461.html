			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Monaco (5): Golden triangle's glitter dims - The property market has fared better than those of its neighbours There is a villa for sale in Monaco, the Villa Fauvette, which boasts no fewer than six bedrooms, five bathrooms, balconies outside, marble floors inside, gardens and terraces all around with a sweet little summer house perched on its roof. The price is FFr15m, or just under Dollars 2.7m. Villa Fauvette is a very special property. It is one of the handful of belle epoque townhouses, or hotels particuliers built in the late 19th century to house Monaco's wealthy residents and visitors, to have survived the principality's post-war building boom. If a suitable buyer appears Villa Fauvette will be handed over intact. But the owners have another option. They could always sell the property to a developer who, thanks to the scarcity of land in Monaco, would probably be prepared to pay almost as much as the FFr15m purchase price. Villa Fauvette would then become the latest in the long line of belle epoque relics to be demolished to make way for yet another new apartment block. Anyone glancing at the dozens of 'For Sale' and 'To Let' signs festooned across the facades of Monaco's apartments, shops and offices could be forgiven for thinking that there was no shortage of property already on the market. The local property industry has been affected by the downturn that has depressed the European market in recent years. Yet the idiosyncratic nature of the Monegasque market - dominated by a small number of powerful property owners and a high proportion of rich, relatively recession-proof private clients - has enabled it to withstand the recession rather better than its counterparts in other countries, notably in neighbouring France and Italy. The dearth of land, where sites for new development are so scarce that one of the biggest projects is the construction of a new underground railway station so that apartments can be built on top, has always ensured that there is strong demand for unusual properties on prime sites such as Villa Fauvette. The seeds of the Monegasque property market were sewn in the early 1970s by Prince Rainier and Gildo Pastor, the multimillionaire developer. They presided over a building boom that filled most of the principality's available sites together with reclaimed land in the 1970s and 1980s. The price of Monegasque property escalated sharply with the cost of new apartments rising from around FFr3,000 a square metre in 1971, according to industry estimates, to FFr10,000 in 1980 and to FFr70,000 at the market's peak in 1990. Prices in the golden triangle of Monte Carlo (in the area around the Casino and the Hotel de Paris) rose even higher to anything between FFr100,000 and FFr125,000 a square metre, which made them roughly comparable to the most expensive parts of Paris. Prices have since weakened. 'The Monaco property market has certainly been affected by the economic recession,' says Yves Max, chief executive of Credit Foncier de Monaco, one of the biggest banks in the principality with interests in the property sector. 'But the downturn has not lasted as long, nor has it been as strong as in other parts of the Cote d'Azur such as Nice or Cannes.' Mr Max estimates that the average price of residential property has fallen by 'between 10 and 20 per cent' since its 1990 peak. Commercial prices have probably fallen further, but that represents a relatively small part of the Monegasque market. The speculation of the 1980s, whereby apartments would be sold from the plans and resold several times before they had actually been built, has fizzled out. Yet the upper end of the residential sector has remained robust, particularly in the most expensive areas such as the golden triangle where prices have barely changed despite the recession. One of the main reasons for the market's comparative stability is the presence of a handful of solid, local investors notably the Pastor group (now run by Gildo Pastor's sons, Michel and Victor) and Societe des Bains de Mer (SBM), the state-controlled hotel and casino operator. These companies have a long-term commitment to Monaco. It is scarcely in their interest to depress the market by dumping properties through panic selling. Further, they are exactly the type of large, well-established businesses that can afford a long-term approach to investment. Similarly Monaco's wealthy residents have been spared the worst of the recession. Many are affluent enough to have been able to hold on to their old properties, rather than risk selling them at low prices. Finally, the level of construction activity has slowed down, partly in response to the recession and partly because of the land shortage. As a result the market has already responded to the easing of recessionary pressures in Europe. Local estate agents say that the price of new residential property has returned to around FFr60,000 a square metre, just below its peak in the late 1980s. 'We've definitely seen an increase in demand for residential property in Monaco,' says Betty Bloom, director of the SPA Property Agency, which specialises in the South of France and is the agent for Villa Fauvette. 'There's tremendous interest from Italians, but also from Germans, the British and even from a few very rich Russians who have come on to the market.' The recent rise in Monegasque property prices reflects a general improvement across the Riviera, but the idiosyncrasies of the local market coupled with the particular attractions of the principality have ensured that the recovery was faster there. 'No-one ever mentions tax, but it's obviously a major factor in drawing people to Monaco,' says Ms Bloom. 'It's also a safe, clean and politically stable place to live. Monaco is more popular than other Riviera towns, even though you could buy a lovely property in a pretty part of Antibes for half the price you'd pay in Monaco.'</p>

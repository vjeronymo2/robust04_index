Also seized were two shotguns  wrapped in a map and concealed under the driver's seat of a  vehicle. During the operation, a total of 30 suspects were  rounded up, most of whom are Konkombas.    Briefing newsmen after the operation, the greater Accra  regional police commander, Mr. Joseph Mprah, said the shotguns  were hidden in the roofs of yam stalls, which also serve as  residence for the traders at the market. He stated that the  exercise is the result of information reaching his office that  the Konkomba market is used as a source of arms supply to the  north. Mr. Mprah said the inspector general of police, Mr.  Kwofie, therefore ordered the operation as a way of eliminating  the source of arms supply and ensuring that all arms are  retrieved from the warring parties in the conflict.    He appealed to arms and ammunition dealers in the country to  complement the government's efforts for peace by being  circumspect in their business transactions. He asked them to  place the national interest above their personal interests and  refuse the sale of arms to anyone bearing a suspicious permit or  one with a name belonging to the conflict zone. The exercise  was later extended to the timber market, where 32 persons were  arrested for dealing in Indian hemp.</p>

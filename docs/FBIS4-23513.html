			<p>BFN     [Text] President of the Republic Joaquim Chissano said  today that his ruling party, Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation  Front], acknowledges that many initiatives could have already  been taken to resolve the most serious problems affecting  Mozambican society, particularly now that peace prevails in the  country. President Chissano said there was indecision in  dealing with problems like corruption and slackness, but that  was to ease the transition from war to peace.    Chissano added that his colleagues realize that the  government has not introduced corrective measures to deal with a  number of serious problems because it is facing a lack of means  due to the 16-year war.    President Chissano, who has been chairing the Frelimo  Central  Committee's second special session since yesterday, said Frelimo  and its cadres are aware of the solutions to be introduced to  resolve the country's main problems. He added that far reaching  initiatives have been taken to improve the situation. That  appears to have been the message Chissano conveyed during his  recent tours of Nampula and Cabo Delgado Provinces.    Commenting on the confinement and demobilization of  government and Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] troops,  he said government troops are being demobilized despite a brief  interruption. Turning to an alleged proposal from Renamo leader  Afonso Dhlakama that his men could be demobilized at their bases  without having to report to assembly areas, Chissano said:    [Begin Chissano recording] I think that would be against the  peace accord. The accord ought to be adhered to as long as it  is possible to do so. Right now we think it is possible to  fulfill the accord, particularly because Renamo does not have  many troops left to demobilize. So, one does not understand why  Renamo troops should be demobilized at their bases. I think  troops can still be confined to assembly bases. [end recording]</p>

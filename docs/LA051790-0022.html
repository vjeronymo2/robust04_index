			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IMPROVING POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS  </P> <P> Election day is bearing down on us. Is it possible that we voters are really  such ninnies as the politicians tell us we are? If you contribute to a party or  candidate, thereafter every mail will bring you one or more requests for  immediate further contributions if you are to save the candidate or the party.  </P> <P> The reason, they say, is that the candidates that spend the most money are  always the winners. Not worthiness of election, but dollars, win.  </P> <P> We often express unhappiness about our knee-jerk Congress that foresees nothing  and second-guesses everything. Yet we are told that 98% of the incumbents win,  and will again unless we send dollars.  </P> <P> Are we voters really that simple-minded? Why don't we just vote the rascals out  and get a fresh start? I will if you will.  </P> <P> EMERSON JOHNSON  </P> <P> San Juan Capistrano  </P></p>

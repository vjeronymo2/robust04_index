			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / World Trade News: China to import top-class films China yesterday said it would allow its cinemas to screen newly-made foreign films and to share profits with producers, but only about 10 'excellent' new movies would be signed for screening each year. 'An end is in sight to the 40-year-old tradition of buying out-dated and low-grade but cheap foreign movies,' said Chinafilm, the state monopoly film importer. 'We are negotiating with world-renowned film corporations in the US and some other countries, with which we had no contact before,' said China-film spokesman Mr Wang Zengfu. He declined to identify the companies or the profit-sharing arrangements. The imports might include Oscar winners and other leading films, according to the official Xinhua news service. Mr Wang said the selected films for screening would 'reflect world civilisation and modern achievements in film and art techniques'. Up to now, Chinese television and cinemas have recycled classic films such as The Sound of Music, Gone with the Wind and Roman Holiday. TV has often shown soap operas, including Dynasty, and Beauty and the Beast. After the 1989 crackdown on dissent culminated in the Tiananmen massacre, cinemas were compelled to run communist propaganda films and were nearly always empty apart from young couples using their free tickets as an opportunity to cuddle in the dark. In 1991, Politburo Standing Committee member Li Ruihuan, a relatively liberal senior leader, reversed the restrictions on films with no propaganda value, and cinema managers looked forward to getting out of the red. But China's film makers still have running battles with the censors and with bureaucrats at state-owned movie studios. This has caused a shortage of box-office hits, so that most of the country's 200,000 cinemas are still losing money. Many Chinese prefer to stay at home and watch one of the new rash of locally made soaps or pirate videos. Most of the latter are dubbed or produced in Taiwan and Hong Kong and many are lewd and violent, despite repeated police crackdowns on both pornography and pirating. In the past two years, foreign film makers undertaking joint productions in China have had frequent clashes with censors. There are so many taboos that it is hard to predict what kind of international hits might be allowed into the country. Earlier this month China said it would impose new censorship rules on imported films. 'The plan is aimed at expanding cultural exchanges, reviving the film market, meeting the audience's needs and developing the national film industry,' Mr Wang said. Xinhua said western films were introduced in the 1960s but 'most of the movies were second-rate or third-rate, usually seven or eight years old'.</p>

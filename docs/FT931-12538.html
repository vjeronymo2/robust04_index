			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / SIB sends more cases to police THE Securities and Invest-ments Board reported a sharp rise in the number of cases referred for criminal investigation last year. The number of convictions for investment fraud rose sharply as well, Norma Cohen writes. Last year 40 cases were referred to the police or the Serious Fraud Office, up from 32 in 1991. In total 145 cases have been referred for criminal investigation since the Financial Services Act took effect in 1988. The SIB statistics show that the 37 of the 40 cases referred for criminal investigation are so-called authorised firms which have passed the tests of 'fitness and properness' needed for membership in a self-regulatory body.</p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> VIOLENCE, ARRESTS AS MINERS PICKET  </P> <P> Violence flared anew on mining picket lines today with the president of a  Kentucky coal company hospitalized after being hit in the face with a rock. In  West Virginia, miners were arrested by the vanload for blocking a bridge.  </P> <P> Charles Snavely, president of A. T. Massey subsidiary Sidney Coal Co. in  Kentucky's Pike County, was hospitalized this morning after he was hit in the  face with a rock, a company spokeswoman said. In Prenter, W.Va., about 400  United Mine Workers members and supporters blocked a road leading to non-union  Elk Run Coal Co. today, saying they would not move until arrested. More than 30  miners had been arrested before noon, said state police spokesman Ric Robinson.  "We're arresting them literally by the vanload," he said.  </P> <P> The incidents came one day after the UMW union extended a contractually allowed  three-day work stoppage for two more days after a spate of wildcat strikes in  eight states.  </P></p>

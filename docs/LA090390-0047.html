			<p><P> September 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LABOR DAY  </P> <P> Today marks the celebration of Labor Day, set aside to recognize labor's  contribution to the nation.  </P> <P> Credit for the idea of Labor Day is given to Matthew Maguire, a New Jersey  machinist, and Peter J. McGuire of New York, co- founder of a labor  organization that eventually became the American Federation of Labor. After  several states began observing the first Monday in September as Labor Day in  the 1880s, Congress made the day a federal holiday in 1894.  </P> <P> * Closed: All government offices, courts, banks, post offices, stock and  commodity exchanges, libraries and many businesses. RTD buses will follow  Sunday schedules.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Yesterday's Democratic Party communique stresses  that, by introducing the new tax system through decrees, the  government of Nikola Sainovic is ignoring the assembly, which is  the only entity that has the right to decide on this matter. By  introducing these decrees, the republic government, whose  mandate expired with the dissolution of the assembly, is in  violation of Article 52 of the Serbian Constitution, which  stipulates that "taxes and other fees can only be introduced  through law." This bypassing of the laws passed in the assembly  and governing by decree in fact represents the introduction of a  state of emergency by the Government of Serbia.    Thus, the introduction of a new tax according to which all  enterprises are obligated to pay 10,000 German marks at the  beginning of the year, regardless of their income or number of  employees, will shut down even the small number of successful  enterprises and force everyone who wants to earn a living to do  so in an illegal way. It is the same with the introduction of  the republic tax on buses leaving the country, which affects the  poorest strata of the population the most.    All of this indicates that the ruling party, instead of  attempting to achieve a consensus of all the parties in the new  assembly in order to stop the hyperinflation and introduce order  in the legal system and the market, has opted for unlawful  measures by which the citizens of Serbia are being robbed. The  Democratic Party believes that such behavior at a time when our  country is in a great crisis cannot bring good to our people, it  is stated in this communique.</p>

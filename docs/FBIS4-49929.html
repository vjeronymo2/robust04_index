			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Invention Is Aimed at Application"] </F>   [Text] The results of the first nationwide election of  excellent entrepreneurs with inventive achievements have already  been released and Premier Li Peng has cordially met with the  winners and delivered an important speech. This was an exciting  event for the inventors and entrepreneurs in our country. We  extend warm congratulations to these outstanding representatives  who have won the title of excellent entrepreneurs with inventive  achievements in this election, the first of its kind in our  country.    It is not easy to create an invention and it is even harder  to apply an invention to industrial production. We have several  tens of thousand inventions each year but too few of these  inventions are applied to industrial production and transformed  into productive forces. This group of entrepreneurs with  inventive achievements who have now been presented to the public  have not only made inventions of their own but have also applied  their inventions to real industrial production, producing  excellent economic returns and social benefits.    Ours is a time of creation and reform which calls on more  inventor-entrepreneurs to come forward and for more inventions  to be applied to industrial production and commercialized. To  transfer inventions to the industrial production process, we  need a large number of entrepreneurs with knowledge of modern  science and technology, modern management ability, modern  business know-how, and a sense of creation. We hope this first  nationwide election of excellent entrepreneurs with inventive  achievements will give impetus to and set an example for the  application of inventions to industrial production in our  country.    The history of the world and China has proved time and again  that science and technology are daily becoming the most active  and important motivation for social and economic development.  Without the development and application of science and  technology, there would be no economic prosperity and social  progress. If an enterprise wants to grow and take the market,  it had better develop its own inventions and patented  technology. Every one of the 10 prize winners of this first  nationwide election of excellent entrepreneurs with inventive  achievements has his patented inventions and some of them are  even the owners of more than 60 patents each. The history of  the rise and decline of enterprises, in China and abroad alike,  has shown that an enterprise without its own patented technology  can hardly win in keen market competition.    China is a country with an ancient civilization and a long  history, which made splendid scientific and cultural  achievements in ancient times. But, however splendid a nation's  scientific and cultural achievements have been in the past, this  nation will radiate a myriad of dazzling rays today and in the  future only if it keeps developing its sciences and culture. We  wholeheartedly wish that our inventors and entrepreneurs will  unremittingly assimilate advanced scientific and technological  knowledge, learn advanced business management know-how,  constantly enhance improving themselves in the fields of science  and culture, and thus carry forward the fine traditions of the  Chinese nation amid the great tide of reform and opening up and  make greater contributions to promoting technological progress  and economic development of our country.</p>

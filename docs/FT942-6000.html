			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Japanese trade surplus forecast to fall by 6.1% Japan's politically troublesome trade surplus will shrink by 6.1 per cent in 1994, the first drop in four years, according to the country's nine largest trading companies. A survey by the Foreign Trade Council, the trading groups' industry body, predicts the trade surplus will fall to Dollars 114.3bn (Pounds 76.2bn) in the year to next March. The forecast, a welcome sign as the US and Japan make a fresh attempt to break the deadlock in trade talks, is however a slight increase on the council's estimate in December of a Dollars 113.5bn surplus. This reflects the fact that Japan's main foreign markets are recovering faster than domestic demand. The council based its forecast on 1 per cent economic growth this year - and that is well above average market expectations. The surplus started to fall from the third to the fourth quarter of last year, but picked up again slightly, to the Japanese authorities' concern, in the first three months of 1994. Exports will rise by 2.8 per cent to Dollars 376.5bn this year, the council forecasts. The yen's strength will stimulate demand for imports, expected to rise by 7.4 per cent to Dollars 262.2bn. Semiconductor sales to US and Asian computer makers will be the star export performers, up 12.3 per cent, according to the survey. But it predicts that car exports will rise by a mere 0.4 per cent, due to the shift in production to lower-cost foreign plants.</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Japan's economic indicators point to continued stagnation JAPAN'S economy is hovering between recovery and decline, the government's official forecasting agency said yesterday. The latest monthly report from the Economic Planning Agency showed that the diffusion index of economic indicators stood at 50 last month, exactly the dividing line between growth and contraction. This is a slight improvement from July, when the index stood at 40, the third consecutive month for which it had fallen below 50. The index measures the economic outlook for the coming six months, but can be unreliable, since it had indicated a recovery in the first four months of this year. Among the index's components, money supply, machinery orders and housing starts continued to rise in August, as in previous months. The main changes in trend were job offers, which increased for the first time in five months, and industrial stocks, which started to decline for the first time in six months. Overall construction orders were down, however. The agency's other two main indices showed a slight improvement in August. The index of coincident indicators, which measures current economic conditions, stood at 50.0 last month, against zero in July, while the index of lagging indicators, which traces economic trends in the past, was at 42.9 in August, against a 21.4 a month earlier. Agency officials warned that weak industrial production could pull the coincident index back below 50 in September and October. Their fears were reinforced yesterday by an announcement from Mazda, the car producer, that it aims to make all its 25,000 staff take two extra days off in November on reduced pay, to adjust production in line with reduced demand. NKK, the steel group, will meanwhile cut managers' winter bonuses and senior executives' salaries from November because of a fall in profits. Japan will find it difficult to meet its target of 3.3 per cent growth in gross national product this year, admitted Ms Manae Kubota, the economic planning agency minister. The EPA's forecast is generally seen, even by other government departments, as optimistic. Most independent economists believe the economy will shrink slightly or stagnate this year. The Industrial Bank of Japan yesterday became the latest to downgrade its forecasts, from 0.6 per cent growth for the year to next March, to a 0.3 per cent decline for the same period, followed by a 0.3 per cent rise in 1994.</p>

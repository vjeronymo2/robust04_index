			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. RELATIONS WITH CHINA  </P> <P> I find it difficult to describe the disgust I feel towards President Bush and  Marlin Fitzwater, White House Press Secretary, after reading "Bush Acts to Ease  Sino-U.S. Tension" (Part I, June 17).  </P> <P> These two typical politicians want to salvage this relationship because of  "America's once-flourishing commercial relationship with China." So what if the  Chinese leadership has no qualms about ordering the wanton slaughter of its  citizens; the U.S. feels it is more important to overlook these atrocities for  the almighty buck! Part of this commercial endeavor was sending arms to the  Chinese. Were these the arms used to put down the pro-democracy revolt?  Fitzwater even admits that the U.S. government works with the leaders in charge  at the time. Terrific!  </P> <P> I guess it is no secret that the U.S. government will gladly deal with  international criminals, whether they are running a country or not. What are a  few thousand Chinese lives worth, anyway, when there is a buck to be made.  </P> <P> DON WHITWORTH  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

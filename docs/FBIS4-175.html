			<p>BFN     [Text] It is reported from London that emergency plans are  being drafted to airlift up to 350,000 Britons out of South  Africa if chaos should erupt after the election. The report  said that British Airways was preparing to divert flights to  Johannesburg and Cape Town if violence in the townships spread  to the white community. One million three hundred thousand  whites hold dual South African-British citizenship, but it is  reported that priority in such an evacuation will be given to  those whose sole nationality is British. Last week reports from  Lisbon said that the Portuguese government had plans for the  evacuation of about 600,000 Portuguese nationals from South  Africa if necessary.</p>

			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> AMWAY PAYS $38-MILLION TO CANADA  </P> <P> Amway Corp. has agreed to pay $38.1 million to settle charges it avoided paying  Canadian duties, and in exchange the government dropped a $125.4-million suit  against the direct sales company, an official said today.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Revenue Minister Otto Jelinek said the government filed notice  to drop the suit Wednesday in the Federal Court of Canada. Amway initiated  negotiations to settle the case a year ago, he added.  </P> <P> "It's not a bad settlement," said the spokesman, who asked not to be  identified.  </P> <P> Amway officials at the company's headquarters in Ada, Mich., were not  immediately available for comment.  </P> <P> Canada's revenue agency had accused Amway of avoiding custom duties by  undervaluing merchandise it exported from the United States to Canadian  distributors during a six-year period beginning in 1974.  </P> <P> The 9-year-old lawsuit sought money for unpaid customs duties, sales taxes and  the value of the Amway products that crossed into Canada during those six  years.  </P></p>

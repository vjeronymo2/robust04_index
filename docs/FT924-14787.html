			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Printing industry sees more job cuts MORE THAN 80 per cent of the printing industry is not working at full capacity and more redundancies are expected, according to the industry's latest quarterly review. The British Printing Industries Federation said three months ago seven out of 10 printers had forecast an improvement in general trading conditions but fewer than one in 10 had actually experienced an improvement. The latest survey shows that half the industry shed jobs in the past three months and one in five printers expect to cut more jobs this quarter. Only 20 per cent of the industry sees the outlook brightening. 'The industry sees nothing to suggest that any fundamental recovery is under way,' the survey says. Printing companies thought the decision to leave the European exchange rate mechanism could be beneficial, but many expressed concern that any benefit was offset by the uncertainty created by 'the government's wavering policies'.</p>

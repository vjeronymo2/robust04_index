The President Rabbani's sources quoting the General  Committee  member of HIA (H) [Hezb-e Eslami Afghanistan, Hekmatyar  Faction], Ubaidollah Serat said that the latter along with other  15 central leaders of HIA (H) and announced their dissociation  from the fighting terming an alliance with communist Rashid  Dostam as unholy one. Those they claimed dissociated from the  fighting also included Deputy chief of HIA (H), Qazi Amin Waqad,  central leaders Munshi Majid, Hussain Deljo, Qazl Najiullah and  Prof Zara.    They also claimed that they had destroyed seven MIG planes  of  Rashid Dostam, Wednesday [26 January] took over more three posts  from him in the north-east of Kabul city while 15 personnel  fleeing from the latter's command were arrested by Maulavi  Saddiqullah of Harekat-e Eslami [Islamic Movement]. They,  however, said that rockets were continued to be fired at Kabul  city throughout the day while in Baghlan Province the Commander  of 54-Brigade of Rashid Dostam, namely Mohammad Ullah Nagar  Joined Shora Nazar of Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, besides 500 personnel  of HIA (H) led by commanders Abdol Ali, Jalal and Mirza Rahim  also joined Mas'ud forces along with their weapons.    In Paryab province they said to have captured a huge  quantity  of heavy weapons from Rashid Dostam's forces.    On the other hand the HIA (H) has termed the visit of  Najibollah Lafraie to Islamic Republic of Iran as very personal  and should not be therefore, considered as a minister of state  of Afghanistan. "Mr. Lafraie cannot speak on behalf of the  government or state of Afghanistan nor he was empowered to sign  any contract or memorandum or agreement on behalf of the  government of Afghanistan".    They further alleged that an amount equal to 70 million  dollars in different currencies was looted by the government  forces when they captured Sraj Shahznda from HIA (H) and  Jonbesh-e Melli forces. However, the commission appointed by  President Rabbani headed by Gen Fahcem said in Kabul that  according to its report the money changers had withdrawn their  amount before they repulsed the attacks of HIA (H) and Jumbashi  Milli.    Meanwhile, the Council for Understanding and National Unity  of Afghanistan (comprising renowned commanders, tribal elders  and noted religious scholars) have welcomed the UN Security  Council's statement calling for an immediate cessation of  hostilities.    In the open letter to the UN Secretary General, the Council  noted with concern that for more than three weeks bloody battle  was raging in the around Kabul where hundreds of innocent men,  women and children were being killed mercilessly every day and  forcing more than one hundred thousand defenceless Afghans to  flee Kabul city in the severe winter.    The Council noted with regret that the UN Security Council's  statement fell short of calling for an immediate cessation of  foreign interference which was the root cause of the ongoing  human tragedy in Afghanistan for in fact, intense and continuing  foreign involvement in Afghan affairs by friendly and unfriendly  powers as well as a myriad of well-financed fundamentalist  organisations has precluded Afghans from finding their own  solution.    They firmly believed that a Loya Jirga [Afghan Assembly]  would have national legitimacy representing a broad spectrum of  Afghan society lending to a broad-based political structure  acceptable to the Afghan people. The letter said the Loya Jirga  being a built-in mechanism in the traditional Afghan society has  deep roots in the Afghan culture and it is an effective time  honoured instrument for conflict resolution. The Council  informed that it would not approve of the recent Pakistan's  proposal for convening a regional conference on Afghanistan if  it does not aim at calling for the UN involvement to promote a  political settlement to the Afghan conflict. For the Afghans,  the letter said have had highly disastrous results from all  foreign brokered and sponsored accords namely the Peshawar  Accord of April 24, 1992, the Islamabad Accord of March 7 1993,  and the Jalalabad Accord of May 25, 1993, aimed at installing a  fundamentalist dominated government in Kabul.</p>

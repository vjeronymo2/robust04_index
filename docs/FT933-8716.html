			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Standard Chartered volatile AN ABRUPT change of heart by marketmakers in Standard Chartered, the UK banking group, saw the bank's shares stage a remarkable about turn, as initial disappointment with the bank's interim figures was transformed by the appearance of no more than a handful of buying orders. These proved enough to uncover substantial short positions among marketers which immediately responded by marking the shares sharply higher. The extent of the rally in Standard shares was breathtaking. News of slightly disappointing headline profits figure of Pounds 169m, sharply higher bad debts and slight disappointment with the extent of the dividend increase, saw dealers chop their opening price for Standard from an overnight 898p to 875p. The downside pressure quickly evaporated, however, as analysts returned from the post-results meeting in buoyant mood, pointing to proposed Far Eastern listings for Standard shares and to prospects for a rise in share earnings this year and next. A flurry of buying drove the shares to an all-time high of 954p around midday. The shares closed a net 51 up at 949p. Mr Peter Toeman at Hoare Govett said Standard shares 'still look a good bet', while Mr Nick Dobby at Robert Fleming Securities said 'with a prospective price earnings ratio for 1994 of 8.3 times in a rapidly growing part of the world currently much in vogue and dividend cover of nearly five times, the shares still look cheap'. Analysts said the chances of a rights issue, with the bank's tier one capital rising from 4.9 per cent to 5.4 per cent, 'have all but disappeared. With earnings per share set to rise to around 91p this year and 115p next year, the bank has excellent dividend growth prospects.' Talk of a possible takeover bid for the bank was said to have been overplayed. 'With the share at around 950p and net asset value at 450p a predator would have to write off a lot of goodwill,' said another banks analyst.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Pavel Felgengauer report under the "Crimea" rubric with the </F> general heading: "General Grachev: `If Troops Are Being Pulled  Up, an Armed Conflict Is Virtually Unavoidable'"]    [Text] Russian Defense Minister General Grachev believes  that the Crimea situation could cause "a serious conflagration.  If troops are being moved up, an armed conflict is virtually  inevitable." The Russian Defense Ministry has been receiving  reports about the concentration of Ukrainian troops in Crimea.  There are around 400 Ukrainian special-purpose troops in the  area of the Belbek airport (10 km north of Simferopol); 500  contract servicemen landed on the cape of Khersones; and 200  Ukrainian national guards (primarily from Ukraine's western  oblasts) are on Sevastopol's eastern outskirts (Sukharnaya  Balka). Reinforcements amounting to another 200 men are also  expected.    Russian intelligence agencies are checking reports that the  1st Ukrainian Mobile Air Brigade in Bolgrad has been put on full  alert. Currently the brigade is under the command of General  Babich (former chief of staff of the 98th Airborne Division).  General Grachev knows him as "a competent and decisive officer"  who is "capable of a great deal."    Black Sea Fleet units have been ordered to "stop any  provocations in the most decisive fashion." Presently,  facilities of the Crimean Internal Affairs Ministry have been  protected by special-purpose army units and the OMON [Special  Purpose Militia Detachment] of the Crimean Internal Affairs  Ministry.</p>

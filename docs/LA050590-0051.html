			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PATIENCE PAYS OFF FOR PHEBUS;  </P> <P> TENNIS: CORONA DEL MAR 16-YEAR-OLD WINS TWICE TO GAIN BERTH IN TODAY'S 18S  FINAL AT MISSION VIEJO.  </P> <P> The powers that be seeded Keri Phebus of Corona del Mar High School eighth in  the 18-and-under division of the Seventeen Magazine Tennis Tournament of  Champions.  </P> <P> Phebus, top-ranked nationally in the 16s and the tournament's defending 16s  champion, didn't know several of the players seeded ahead of her.  </P> <P> "I wasn't complaining," she said. "It made me the underdog, so I don't mind."  </P> <P> It seemed a curious move when the tournament began Wednesday. Now, it seems  stranger still.  </P> <P> Today, Phebus will play in the 18s final at 1 p.m. at the Marguerite Recreation  Center in Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> To reach the final, Phebus had to beat the second- and fourth-seeded players  Friday. No. 2 Christine Neuman of Downers Grove, Ill., lost, 6-3, 6-4, in the  quarterfinals Friday morning. In the semifinals later in the day, Kristin  Osmond of Worthington, Ohio, couldn't match Phebus' patient game plan and lost,  6-4, 6-4.  </P> <P> Phebus will meet Jennifer Baker of Wesley Chapel, Ohio, who defeated Jennifer  Nasser of Arlington Heights, Ill., 3-6, 6-2, 7-6, in the other semifinal.  </P> <P> Against Osmond, an 18-year-old senior at Worthington High who will attend the  University of Florida in the fall, Phebus fell behind, 2-0, in the first set  and 3-0 in the second.  </P> <P> Phebus, who turned 16 Wednesday, said she was never worried.  </P> <P> "I always play better when I'm behind," said Phebus, who has won back-to-back  Southern Section singles titles. "It's my personality. I'm more of a fighter."  </P> <P> It sounds like an odd approach, but it worked.  </P> <P> Her serve, strong though it may be, wasn't particularly effective against  Osmond. Phebus had just three aces.  </P> <P> She rarely came to the net, letting her cross-court volleys make up most of her  attack.  </P> <P> Osmond gained her early advantages by coming to the net when she could and  pounding the ball back at Phebus. No matter the score, Phebus seemed content to  stay on the baseline, hammering groundstroke after groundstroke while waiting  for Osmond to make a mistake.  </P> <P> "All she does is get everything back," Osmond said. "She's so consistent. I was  up 3-0 (in the second set) and I was pounding the ball. I can't play like that  the whole match."  </P> <P> In the end, too many unforced errors and steady, patient play by Phebus cost  her a spot in the final, Osmond said.  </P> <P> "I could have done what she did (stay at the baseline), but the match would  have lasted five hours," she said.  </P> <P> Tournament Notes  </P> <P> In the 16s semifinals, Ditta Huber of La Jolla defeated Amy Chiminello of  Melrose, Mass., 4-6, 6-1, 6-2, and Jill Craybas of East Greenwich, R.I., beat  Wendy Sacks of Memphis, Tenn., 6-3, 6-1. Huber plays Craybas in today's final  at 11:30 a.m.  </P> <P> In the 14s semifinals, Lindsay Davenport of Palos Verdes advanced to the final  by beating Anne Miller of Midland, Mich., 6-2, 7-6. Janet Lee of Palos Verdes  defeated Maggie Cole of Santa Cruz, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2. Davenport and Lee meet in  the 10 a.m. final.  </P></p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Right jobs for the right people Sir, Michael Prowse ('A misguided focus on job creation', March 14) says that 'inequality is simply the price we pay for a general level of prosperity unimaginable under any other economic system'. I agree - though I would argue about the levels of inequality he regards as necessary. What I cannot agree with is his use of the word 'we'. Michael Prowse is not paying the price of inequality, except perhaps in higher insurance premiums for his car. This is not a rant against Mr Prowse, whose ear is usually pretty close to the ground: who exactly pays the 'price' he describes is - or should be - central to discussions on employment. The debates in Detroit this week about the apparent trade-off between more jobs and better jobs, the concerns of the Europeans and Americans respectively, have missed at least half the point: who gets the jobs. If it is the same individuals and families who suffer from market-generated inequalities, the result is US-style ghettoisation, crime, fear and waste. Spreading the pain around is as important as pain reduction. An example of this crucial distributional issue in the UK is the growing gap between 'work-rich' (two-earner) and 'work-poor' (no earner) families. The jobs which have been created have been taken at the top by men, who work the longest hours in Europe, and at the bottom by their over-qualified wives who want to combine part-time paid work with looking after their children. This trend is caused by the inflexibility of our welfare system and the insistence of men to work such long hours (a million extra jobs could have been created in the 1980s if working hours had continued declining). Of course job creation is vital. But equally important is the efficient and equitable functioning of labour markets. Governments can and should play an important part in making this, the most important of all markets, work better.

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / A small band voices support for change: Constitutional views in Scotland THIS WEEK several Scottish businessmen did what the Conservative party has been urging them to do for years - they stood up to be counted on the issue of Scotland's constitutional future. Unfortunately, what they said was not what the Tory party wanted to hear. Nine men who run small and medium-sized businesses launched an organisation called Scotland Says Yes and said they were 'sick and tired' of the government implying that all Scottish business was totally opposed to the setting up of a Scottish parliament. They said they and many others were eagerly awaiting the creation of such an institution. In the past few weeks several of Scotland's leading businesspeople have indeed declared their opposition both to a devolved Scottish parliament and to independence. This week the big institutions in the financial community expressed - through a survey by Scottish Financial Enterprise, their trade association - strong misgivings about devolution. They feared higher taxes, and a drift towards independence which would frighten their English customers. But on Thursday the Scottish council of the Confederation of British Industry met at Stirling Castle and produced little comfort for the Tories. Mr Alasdair MacCallum, its chairman, said it strongly disliked aspects of a devolved Scottish parliament, notably higher taxes, and detested independence, but it had concluded that 'some change is inevitable and, many people believe, desirable'. Mr Nigel Smith, one of the founders of Business Says Yes, runs an engineering company in Glasgow employing 35 people. He said he voted Conservative in most general elections. He believed a Scottish parliament would be very good for Scottish business. 'Britain is highly centralised. Even though we've got a lot of administrative devolution to the Scottish Office in Edinburgh, policy is decided in London. To influence it we've got to go through the London lobbying structure, which is very difficult for a small business based in Scotland. 'Now if we had a Scottish parliament, policy would be decided in Edinburgh.' Furthermore, Mr Smith argues, the creation of a Scottish parliament would end what he calls the 'disenfranchisement' of much of the Scottish business community. 'If I say something in favour of free enterprise, I'm automatically identified with the Conservative party and that means being identified with England. I'm immediately struck out as a serious contributor.' In a Scottish parliament, elected by proportional representation, he said, there would inevitably be a right-of-centre party with Scottish roots which would present the business point of view. Proportional representation would curb the excesses of left and right, Mr Smith said, and far from imposing higher taxes, as the Tories claim, it might lower them to stimulate business and generate extra revenue. Large Scottish businesses, however, especially Scotland's quoted companies, tend to favour the constitutional status quo - though few have declared themselves. The people who run them often consider themselves part of the British establishment and have lobbying channels through contacts in London and in the City. The contorted response of the Scottish CBI, which failed to say what constitutional arrangements it actually wanted, might reflect divisions between larger and smaller companies. But it also highlighted the lack of communication between the business community and the advocates of constitutional change. Mr MacCallum, the chairman, admitted: 'We've come into the debate a little late. That is regrettable.' The Scottish Constitutional Convention, which has been working on a blueprint for a Scottish parliament since 1989, is dominated by Labour and the Liberal Democrats, having been boycotted by the Tory party and the Scottish National party. The CBI chose not to participate, although the Scottish Council Development and Industry, which also represents business, attended as an observer. Mr Smith said: 'Business was very wrong not to enter the convention.' One result, he said, was that the convention's blueprint included 'baggage from the 1970s', such as the possibility of nationalisation, which might otherwise have been vetoed. For their part the supporters of devolution do not appear to have made much effort to persuade large companies and financial institutions of the possible benefits of a Scottish parliament. Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, has not been on a prawn cocktail offensive around Charlotte Square, Edinburgh. Indeed, when Scottish Financial Enterprise this week reported the fears of the 25 financial institutions which account for 80 per cent of the employees of the Scottish financial sector and 80 per cent of its funds under management, Mr Dewar simply derided the response to the survey as 'tiny'. He did not offer them any reassurance.</p>

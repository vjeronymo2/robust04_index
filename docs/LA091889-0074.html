			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SHOWERS MAKE RARE SEPTEMBER APPEARANCE, MAY BE BACK  </P> <P> Rare September showers sprinkled Orange County over the weekend, and  forecasters say Southern California may get even more drizzles today.  </P> <P> A fireworks display in conjunction with a Hollywood Bowl concert Saturday night  was punctuated by a brilliant celestial display of lightning.  </P> <P> "This weather is a preview of late fall and winter," said Bill Hibbert, a  meteorologist for WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times.  "We've already seen discussions of snow down to the 5,000-foot level in the  northern Sierra, and down to 8,000 feet in southern mountains."  </P> <P> By midday Sunday, Santa Ana had recorded .07 inch of rain. San Juan Capistrano  recorded .03 inch, while Anaheim had .01. Los Angeles recorded .01 inch of  rain, San Diego reported .08, Escondido .20, and Beaumont and Big Bear Lake had  rainfall of .04 inch and .05 inch, respectively. Even Palm Springs -- with a  high temperature of 101 on Sunday -- had .02 inch of rain.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wetter in the North  </P> <P> The Southern California showers were pale in contrast with weekend weather in  Sacramento, where 1.79 inches of rain fell during violent thunderstorms  generated during the last gasp of Hurricane Octave.  </P> <P> "The drizzle now is a result of leftover moisture from ex-Hurricane Octave,  which dissipated over the weekend," Hibbert said. "The storm pushed moisture  into California at the same time a strong low-pressure system began moving  through."  </P> <P> The combination of the hurricane, the normal onshore flow of moist air and the  low pressure "create a very good opportunity for clouds and drizzle to form,"  Hibbert said. "A new low-pressure system entering the state now could pop off  some showers in mountain and offshore areas."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Below-Normal Temperatures  </P> <P> Skies will be partly cloudy today, with a chance of showers or thundershowers,  especially in the mountains and deserts, the National Weather Service said.  Skies should begin clearing tonight and Tuesday will be mostly sunny, but with  continued below-normal temperatures.  </P> <P> Orange County, with a high of 77 in Santa Ana on Sunday, should remain cool  today, with afternoon temperatures climbing only into the mid-60s to low 70s,  said National Weather Service meteorologist Gary Nuemann. Lows tonight will  range from the lows 50s to low 60s. Mountain areas will see lows between the  mid-30s and low 40s.  </P> <P> Deserts will be cooler than normal today, with possible thundershowers, the  weather service said. In the high desert, high temperatures will reach only the  70s. The mercury in the low desert will reach the low 80s to the low 90s.  </P></p>

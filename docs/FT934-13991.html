			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: Lundbergs lifts MoDo voting stake to near 50% LUNDBERGS, a Swedish construction and real estate group, has taken effective control of MoDo, the country's third-largest forestry group. It exchanged shares worth SKr1.1bn (Dollars 137.5m) with one of MoDo's main domestic rivals, Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget (SCA). The agreement increases Lundbergs' voting stake in MoDo to 49 per cent from 26 per cent, and reduces SCA's voting influence from 27 per cent to just 3.5 per cent. This will reduce the ownership tensions within MoDo created when SCA acquired its stake, in December 1990m, for SKr1.4bn. 'The clarification of the ownership picture is positive for MoDo, not least internally,' said Mr Bernt Lof, MoDo chief executive. SCA abandoned its hopes of co-operation with MoDo last year, claiming differences of opinion over strategy. It has effectively been seeking a buyer for its holding since. It believes that by swapping 3.9m A shares, with 10 votes each, for 5.1m one-vote B shares it has gained a more liquid stake, which will be easier to sell once the forestry industry recovers. Even though it gained a 30 per cent premium for its stake, it acknowledged yesterday that MoDo's shares needed to rise 40 per cent before it recouped the SKr1.59bn it has invested, both initially and through subscribing to MoDo's current rights issue. The current market value of its stake is SKr1.14bn. SCA said future investments in Sweden would be centred on value-added products, such as lightweight coated paper. In Europe, meanwhile, it aimed to build up newsprint operations, based on recycled paper, close to big population centres. The company still has an 11.7 per cent equity stake in MoDo, and retains the right to appoint a board representative through an agreement with Lundbergs.</p>

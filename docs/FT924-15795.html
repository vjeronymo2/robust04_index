			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Cautious approach improves City's view - TI's Pounds 87m charge for Dowty was well within expectations IT TOOK some time to come and an attack of pessimism early this week knocked 10 per cent off the share price, but when TI finally released details yesterday of the provisions related to its June acquisition of aerospace group Dowty, the market heaved a huge sigh of relief. Coming after rumours of up to Pounds 150m of provisions and TI's 1990 run-in with the City over acquisition accounting, the Pounds 87.1m figure was modest. Even taking into account the Pounds 25m write-off on the closure of the Cognito paging business, taken in Dowty's last accounts, the provisions appear to be well within market expectations. What is more, TI appears to have been scrupulous about keeping in line with the Accounting Standards Board guidelines of accepted practice - not surprisingly perhaps as Mr Michael Garner, the finance director, is on the ASB. Having taken a long look at Dowty, TI has produced a remarkably detailed breakdown of the fair value adjustments. 'I have never seen that level of disclosure by a company,' said Mr Sandy Morris, analyst at County NatWest. 'TI has set the standard today.' TI's provisions fall into two parts - Pounds 49.7m of reorganisation costs and the balance covering asset value adjustments, changes in accounting policies and items such as investment in improving environmental controls. It has also said that there will be no more provisions related to the Dowty acquisition - in 1990 TI was pilloried in the City for taking a 'second bite' of provisions relating to acquisitions made in 1988. The group has also said that it will use the provisions within two years and all items not required will be released directly back to the balance sheet and not pushed through the profit and loss account, thereby boosting earnings. The biggest single item in the reorganisation is a Pounds 33.8m charge for rationalisation. Some Pounds 6m of this will be used to reverse some of the recent diversification at Dowty's Singapore operations. The second phase of reorganising Dowty's Gloucester sites will cost Pounds 5m and another Pounds 7m is allocated to cover integration of TI's Crane, the engineering seals business, with Dowty's polymer division. Also within the rationalisation category is a Pounds 4m charge for relocating the electronic systems business. And Pounds 6m has been set aside to cover the run-down of Dowty's group and divisional headquarters, its London headquarters and for the amalgamation of offices in Washington. Another Pounds 7.7m covers financial reorganisation. This covers harmonisation of the two groups' taxes, integrating the treasury operations  -including reversing currency and interest rate hedges and modifying bank facilities - and bringing Dowty's financial control systems up to what TI says is a superior standard. Some Pounds 8m will cover redundancies in Dowty's main board, at the headquarters and the closure of some group services. Many of the other fair value adjustments sprang from what TI describes as 'less than conservative accounting.' According to TI, Dowty had to do more than just avoid the negative impact of provisions on earnings. 'They were up against banking covenants, so they had to have one eye out for net shareholders' funds as well,' Mr Garner says. Most controversial will be Dowty's loss-making contracts. Some Pounds 12m covers what TI believes will be losses on contracts over the next two years. TI says Dowty had been providing for losses only on those orders covering customers' immediate needs, a treatment that was insufficiently prudent. TI is also taking a more conservative view of Dowty's stocks. It is writing off Pounds 6m of 'surplus spares' which will be scrapped, but has left on the books any spares where there is a realistic expectation of a sale, however distant. There is also the write-off of certain receivables, bringing the current assets adjustment to Pounds 11.9m. A further Pounds 4.1m comes under the category of 'accounting polices' where TI and its auditors, Price Waterhouse, disagree with Dowty and Arthur Andersen over matters such as the period of depreciating assets like computers and when profits should be taken during the life of long-term contracts. Mr Garner says that in some instances - in the Marine division, for example  -Dowty was not even following its own policies on profit taking. Profits were booked the moment that material hit the shop floor. Yesterday's announcement is notable on two counts. In the first place, analysts appear to believe that the Pounds 87.1m is both reasonable and within expectations. But, by supplying such detailed explanation, TI may more importantly have laid the ghost of its fracas with the City over acquisition accounting. TI now has a much clearer run at trying to prove what it has always believed to be the case; that it is building value in its business through good management rather than through clever accounting.</p>

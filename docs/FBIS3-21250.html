			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Chishio Okimizu, Nobuo Ishii, and Jiro Hataicle, </F> Tokyo Electron Research Institute]    [Text]  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   Since its birth, the integrated circuit (IC) has continued  to  be the target of technological innovation effort. Even today,  work continues to achieve an aggregation of high-level  functions, large memory, and a high degree of density. As a  result, the number of element per chip has increased, and a  demand for 3-dimensionality, which makes further miniaturization  of elements and routing possible, intensifies. Moreover, from  the standpoint of effective pricing, enlargement of wafer's  aperture will be unavoidable.    If such demands are to be met, the capabilities of  manufacturing equipment used in each fabrication process of VLSI  must be improved so that the present limitations can be  overcome. Plasma etching equipment is one such piece of  equipment.    In order to improve capabilities of the existing RF plasma  equipment characterized by a parallel flatboard, a method  designed to adjust process conditions and RF circuits is tried  out, while at the same time an effort to develop a  non-conventional method designed to search for low pressure  process conditions is being pursued. For this reason, it will be  necessary to develop a means of generating plasma. At present,  its applicability to plasma etching equipment by inductive  coupling, such as ECR and magnetron-method discharge technology,  and helicon wave [.sup]1)[/] and RFi discharge  technologies,[.sup]2),3)[/] is being searched.    This paper will report on the RFi discharge technology with  some test results.    Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of a test equipment.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-60A> Figure 1. Schematic Diagram of Test Equipment </FIG>    <H5>  RF Plasma Generation by Inductive Coupling </H5>   This means a plasma generated by the electrical field  induced  by the radio frequency (RF) currents impressed on electric  circuits connected to RF electrical source. Hereinafter, for the  sake of simplicity, it will be referred to as RF induction  plasma.  <H5>  1. Heating and Confining of Electrons </H5>   The process of generating the plasma used in semiconductor  manufacturing equipment involves ionization resulting from the  collision of traveling free electrons, possessing energy greater  than a certain appropriate value, with neutral particles. Since  electrons are far smaller than neutral particles, their average  distance of free traveling is longer, and under low pressure  (mTorr level), even if they gain energy, collision does not  occur, dissipating directly at the chamber wall surface,  frequently not participating in ionization. Consequently, in  order to generate plasmas efficiently, it will be necessary to  confine free electrons into a chamber using some appropriate  method.    The methods of heating electrons currently known are:    (1) one which uses inductive electrical field using a  parallel flatboard-based electrical field;    (2) a method which uses inductive electrical field based on  coils;    (3) ECR or helicon wave heating method which uses  electromagnetic waves.    In the case of ECR heating, since electronic energy in the  magnetic field becomes discrete in the direction vertical to the  magnetic field,[.sup]4)[/] it exhibits resonance  characteristic possessing sharp peak when electrons are heated.  In the direction parallel to the magnetic field, on the other  hand, since electron energy is continuous, it is believed that  heating by helicon waves is carried out with a sufficiently wide  energy width. Moreover, confining free electrons is accomplished  generally by use of the magnetic field; however, in the coil  inductive electrical field, by inducing the concentric circle  electrical field using the shape of coils, to some extent  confining effect can be produced sometimes.  <H5>  2. Generation of Inductive Plasma Generation </H5>   Coils used in this testing are produced by changing the  shape  of the coils described in published reports[.sup]2),3)[/] to  an approximately spiral form.    We obtained distribution of degrees of intensity of  electromagnetic fields using a numerical computation when the  exterior of the coil is made GND potential and RF current is  impressed. At a point located 35mm from the coil's surface, as  shown in Figure 2, we noticed the presence of a strong  electrical field at a midpoint between the interior coil and  exterior coil. It is reasonable to suppose that centering around  this portion, plasma will be generated and diffused to  peripheral areas.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-61A> Figure 2. Inductive Electromagnetic Fields by RF </FIG>      Moreover, since the electrical field is induced in a roughly  concentric shape, electrons which acquired energy probably  repeat rotating motions changing their directions periodically,  thereby gradually enlarging radius and fade on the chamber wall  surface unless collision with neutral particles or rebonding  with ions occur.  <H5>  3. Absorption of Electromagnetic Energy </H5>   When outer magnetic fields are absent, a diffusion relation  formula as shown in (1) can be established for the dissemination  of electromagnetic waves present in the plasma[.sup]5)[/]:  <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-61D> Equation </FIG> _o_[.sup]2[/]=_o_[.sup]2[/][.sup]p[/]+C[.sup]2[/]_k_[.sup]  2[/] (1)    Here _o_ represents the angular velocity of  electromagnetic  waves, _o_[.sup]p[/] angular velocity of plasma vibrations,  and C the velocity of light in a vacuum, and _k_ the wave  number  of electromagnetic waves.    From equation (1), when plasma density increases and  _o_[.sup]p[/] becomes larger, at a certain value,  C[.sup]2[/]_o_[.sup]2[/]'s value becomes negative, clearly  showing drastic attenuation of the electromagnetic waves. Their  attenuation properties at that time is expressed in the  following equation (2):  <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-61E> Equation </FIG>   exp[-z/] (2)    however, =C x  (_o_[.sup]2[/][.sup]p[/]-_o_[.sup]2[/])[.sup]-1/2[/] (3)    Equation (3) is known as the depth of penetration, showing a  distance in which the strength of electromagnetic wave is  attenuated to e[.sup]-1[/]. If the electron density of plasma  is hypothesized as 5 x 10[.sup]11[/]/cm[.sup]-3[/],  is  approximately 0.8cm and the distance to the wafer is below 1/7,  the LSI circuits on the wafer are likely to be destroyed by  inductive electromagnetic waves.  <H5>  Plasma Diffusion </H5>   The RF inductive plasmas formed on the upper perimeters of  the chamber are thought to be diffused to both electrodes. This  is where the RF inductive plasmas differ from the parallel  flatboard RF plasmas.    In other words, plasmas are generated for the most part in  accordance with the previously-mentioned electrical field  strength distribution. It is conjectured that those in the  radial direction fade when they come into contact with the wall  surface while those in the Z direction fade on the wafer or  suscepter surface.    Based on the hypothesis that the plasma density is  proportionate to the distribution of the strength of the  inductive electrical fields, we have calculated numerical value  of the state of diffusion. The result is shown in Figure 3.  Assuming that the velocity of internal flow does not exist, we  applied the diffusion equation shown as the equation  (4).[.sup]6)[/]    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-61C> Figure 3. Plasma Diffusion </FIG>      <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-61B> Equation </FIG>     N(X,Y,Z) denotes plasma density, Q(X,Y,Z) the volume of  plasma generated, and D a diffusion coefficient.    For the Z-axial direction, we can expect a good uniform  plasma with an appropriate diffusion length.  <H5>  Measurement of RF Inductive Plasma </H5>   We observed several attributes of the RF inductive plasma  using the Langmuir probe and the emission spectral measurement  method.  <H5>  1. Measurement by Langmuir Probe </H5>    Observation state is as shown in Figure 1, and gas is Ar.    For probe, we used a PMT product, Fast probe. Figure 4 shows  the dependence of electron density N[.sup]e[/] and  electron temperature T[.sup]e[/] on pressure.  Figure 5 shows dependence of electron density  N[.sup]e[/] and electron temperature  T[.sup]e[/] on electric power. Moreover, Figure 6  shows the radial directional distribution of ion-saturated  currents. We can see from it that as pressure drops, the degree  of uniformity of the central zone becomes higher.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-62A>           Figure 4.

Distribution of Ion-Saturated Current in Radial </FIG>     <H5>  2. Measurement by Emission Spectra </H5>   We measured Ar's emission spectral pressure dependence using  1-150mTorr. Luminescence from the 1-2cm plasma on the susceptor  is condensed and [spectralized] using a lens on the chamber-side  wall. Normalized results based on the maximum intensity of each  individual luminescent wavelength are shown in Figure 7.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-62D> Figure 7. Pressure Dependence of Ar Luminescence </FIG>       In general, emissions from Ar radical exhibited a greater  degree of intensity than those from ions. Moreover, the  intensity of radical emissions, although differed, depending on  transition, had a peak exceeding 10mTorr, and when pressure  falls, its intensity also decreased monotonically. Luminescence  from ions, on the other hand, increased monotonically when  pressure is lowered, reaching the maximum level around 1mTorr.  These results demonstrated that the lower the pressure, the  higher the electron temperature will become.    We let the CHF[.sup]3[/] gas flow and checked change in  intensity in the range of 6-40mTorr for each type of  luminescence. Its results are shown in Figure 8. In the  direction of decreasing pressures, the emission of the  CF[.sup]3[/] radical exhibited monotonic decrease while the  CF radical ended up having the peak around 11mTorr. The  luminescence of C.H.F radical, moreover, showed a substantial  increase of approximately 10 times. Verification of its  correlation with selectivity will be undertaken in the near  future.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-63A>           Figure 8. Pressure Dependence of CHF[.sup]3[/] </FIG>      <H5>  Characteristics of Oxide Film Etching </H5>   Using Ar and CHF[.sup]3[/] gases, we performed the  SiO[.sup]2[/] film etching to investigate several  characteristics associated with it.  <H5>  1. Uniformity </H5>    As shown in Figure 9, a gas inlet was provided at two  locations. When the Ar gas (100%) was used, the radial  directional distribution of the plasma-ion-saturated currents on  the wafer, as shown in Figure 6, was approximately uniform. The  result of the sputter etching performed by impressing 400kHz  bias on the susceptor is shown in Figure 9. Uneven etching speed  might be caused by the side positioning of the electrode facing  the susceptor. We used the wafer with a Si substrate on which  thermal oxide film of 1 micron thickness was grown.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-63B>           Figure 9. Characteristics of Etching with Use of </FIG>        Using the CHF[.sup]3[/] gas, we performed the similar  etching. Its result is shown in Figure 10. Etching is proceeding  in a region spreading to peripheral area from the [orifura]  part. This probably was due to the positional relationship among  gas inductive inlet, susceptor, and exhaust outlet. Figure 11  shows the computed value of gas flow on the wafer. Because of  the constraint of computing algorithms, although we used a  somewhat higher pressure state (20mTorr 100mTorr) in our  computation, the diagram constitutes a clear explanation of the  etching result.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-63C>           Figure 10. Characteristics of Etching with Use of </FIG>      <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-64A>           Figure 11. Distribution of the Velocity of Gas </FIG>        Judging from the result, it will be necessary to design the  optimal positioning of a gas induction inlet, susceptor, and  exhaust outlet in order to achieve etching at a uniform speed.  <H5>  2. Etching Velocity </H5>   Using the CHF[.sup]3[/] (100%) gas, we checked the  etching velocity of an 8-inch oxide film wafer. Its result is  shown in Figure 12. When we raised pressure by increasing the  volume of a flow, we obtained a peak pressure at approximately  20mTorr, and anything above that number has reduced etching  velocity. Since it is in the domain in which increase in plasma  concentration occurs when pressure rises and since bias electric  power is constant, we are yet to ascertain the cause for this,  whether it is due to a decrease in per-ionic energy in the  sheath or an increase in deposit on the oxide film surface.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-65A>           Figure 12. Pressure Dependence of Oxide Film Etching </FIG>      <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-65B>           Figure 13. Etching Shape of Contact Hole </FIG>     <H5>  Characteristics of Etching by Parallel Flat Electrode </H5>   For etching process, RF plasma by a parallel flatboard  electrode was used in the past. In early days, it was used in a  high-pressure domain (number Torr). However, today, as circuits  become increasingly minute, application of a low-pressure domain  (a few 100mTorr) to etching process has become feasible.    In the future, the question of whether both highly  innovative  new RF circuit technology and development of new process will be  able to meet future demands for minute processing of 256MDRAM  and 11GDRAM provides an interesting problem.  <H5>  1. Structure </H5>   The parallel flat electrode unit is a type of structure  already well known and has survived into today, with a few  improvements in the electrode peripheral area mechanisms, as  well as in a method of supplying RF electrical power, so that it  can deal with a low pressure process.  <H5>  2. Plasma Characteristics </H5>   Since the parallel flatboard electrode unit lacks the data  measured directly by the Langmuir Probe, our description will be  limited to that of the emission spectral characteristics.    The foremost characteristic of the narrow-gap parallel  flatboard Ar plasma is that ionic strength toward radical  luminescence intensity is much greater than that of the RF  inductive plasma. (Figure 14). Although it differs by  wavelength, the ion/radical ratio of the parallel flatboard  plasma for the most part is greater by two digits than that of  the RF inductive plasma. This is due to higher electron  temperature of the parallel flatboard type. With the inductive  type, moreover, the number of ions decreases because of ionic  recoupling occurring during transport of plasma.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-65C>           Figure 14. Ar Emission Spectrum </FIG>     <H5>  3. Oxide Film Etching Characteristics </H5>   Figure 15 shows the pressure dependence when oxide film was  etched using our company product ``TE5000S.'' We were able to  obtain excellent results.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-66A>           Figure 15. Etching Characteristics of TE5000S </FIG>       Figure 16 [figure not reproduced] shows the result of  etching  BPS film contact holes measuring 0.33 microns in diameter. The  figure shows good values obtained for etching velocity and  selection ratio (against Si).  <H5>  Conclusion </H5> <H5>  1. RF Inductive Plasma Characteristics </H5>   Although several types of structures can be suggested for  the  RF inductive plasma, depending on positional relationship of a  coil and a chamber, this time, we used the type in which RF coil  is installed facing the wafer to conduct a few of our tests.    By using lower pressure (mTorr  few tens mTorr) than  that  used with the parallel flatboard electrode unit, we were able to  verify the generation of plasma with sufficient level of density  adequate for etching processing.    Moreover, although this structure lacked the GND electrode  facing the susceptor, we were able to verify excellent etching  of oxide film in which current is designed to flow through the  chamber side wall.  <H5>  2. Problems </H5>   Although the equipment operates with a pressure level lower  than that of the existing parallel-flatboard-electrode-type  equipment by one or two digits, because the plasma used is a  diffusion plasma. We expect that, in terms of the emission  spectral characteristics mentioned previously also, its electron  temperature will be somewhat lower. When CHF[.sup]3[/] and  CF[.sup]4[/] gases are used, it is natural to expect that  each molecule's constituent ratio during the process will differ.    Consequently, with respect to oxide film etching also, in  order to obtain good results in selectivity involving resist and  Si, as well as in microloading effect, an effort to develop a  new process will become essential.    Moreover, as mentioned previously, since uniformity in  generated plasma exhibits pressure dependence, it appears that  with the present structure, it is not easy to obtain a wide  process window. In order to deal with this problem, perhaps coil  part should be split so that each electrical power can be  adjusted. If this should become feasible, then the distribution  of plasma density can be controlled, easing pressure dependence.  If we are to establish such a technology, we believe that it may  be possible to use the RF inductive plasma effectively as a  future etching device.  <H5>  Appreciation </H5>   I wish to thank the following people without whose generous  assistance it would not have been possible to carry out this  test project: Acting Chief Tahara of Process Equipment Division  and Fuchu Development Center's Chief Engineer Kawakami who  provided test equipment and samples; Researchers Yazawa, Koike,  Denho, Tateyama, and Tanaka of Research Institute who performed  various computations and analysis of test samples; and Mr.  Hosokawa, head of process section, Tokyo Electron-Yamanashi, who  provided materials on parallel flatboard electrode type  equipment.

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / The ERM - Picking up the Pieces: Danes and Belgians bolster currencies THE central banks of Belgium and Denmark took measures to arrest the fall of their currencies against the D-Mark yesterday, possibly fearing sharp outflows from their bond and equity markets after the widening of the exchange rate mechanism's bands. Most ERM countries appeared concerned yesterday that the new ERM regime could lead to disorderly devaluations of their currencies, and left interest rates unchanged. But the Belgian authorities were concerned to hold their currency close to its former ERM floor to the D-Mark, intervening in the market at the BFr21.50 level against the German currency. Denmark took even more drastic measures, raising one-month interest rates to 25 per cent, after the krone had fallen to DKr4.15 against the D-Mark from the previous floor of DKr3.9016. Both Belgium and Denmark have reasons to be more concerned than other countries about the prospect of a general exchange rate float against the D-Mark. Belgian equity and bond markets have benefited from international flows of funds because of the close monetary and exchange rate relationship that the Belgian franc has had with the D-Mark in recent years. Now that this has been untied, investors may focus more closely on the country's fundamental economic problems, including a huge public debt. Denmark has a fundamentally stronger economic position than have many ERM countries, with the lowest inflation in Europe and a trade surplus. But some analysts believe the unravelling of the ERM may lead dealers to bracket Denmark with Sweden and Finland, both of which have undertaken substantial devaluations against the D-Mark in recent years.</p>

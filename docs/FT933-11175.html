			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / UK Company News: French sale helps Dale jump to Pounds 2.3m DALE Electric International, the North Yorkshire-based power and lighting group, increased pre-tax profits by 41 per cent to Pounds 2.26m in the year to May 2, thanks to an exceptional gain of Pounds 1.05m relating to the disposal of its French subsidiaries in March. Comparisons have been restated as the extraordinary item has been moved up the profits and loss account to an exceptional item, moving towards FRS 3 accounting principles. Accordingly, pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.79m is altered to Pounds 1.6m after an exceptional loss up from Pounds 158,000 to Pounds 347,000. Mr Iain Dale, chairman, said the group had 'a clear idea of its priorities and direction.' The current year would benefit from the restructuring. New opportunities had arisen both in the UK and overseas for the group's range of gas turbine generating sets for mobile and combined heat-and-power applications, he said. Half of group sales of Pounds 60.1m (Pounds 55.9m), came from exports to more than 115 countries. Operating profits fell to Pounds 2.41m (Pounds 3.35m). Mr Dale said the current order book was Pounds 19m, or four months work, compared with Pounds 25m a year ago. He said orders could be the main problem in the current first half in the nervous market. Gearing was reduced from a peak of 110 per cent to 65 per cent, and 'will be reduced further as the main part of the redundant Ashford site and a non-core business are sold.' Interest charges fell from Pounds 1.86m to Pounds 1.57m. Earnings per share increased by 51 per cent to 13.24p (8.74p). The final dividend of 3.1p makes an unchanged total of 5.1p. Sir Tom McDonald, former chairman, is to retire as a non-executive director tomorrow. The shares gained 6p to 110p.</p>

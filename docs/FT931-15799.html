			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Arts: Growing beyond the fringe - Theatre The best of London's fringe theatre is outgrowing its original purpose - which was to show to a small audience plays that might not be seen elsewhere. Theatres like The Gate in Notting Hill, The Bush in W12 and The King's Head in Islington are now suffering from the problems of their own success. Precisely because of their high standards of acting and directing, the performances are often far better than the basic script. Besides, the economics of playing to a full house of under 100 people must be questionable. The next move must be seek more space and better financial arrangements in order to show their wares to a wider audience, which I understand is what The Gate is now doing by appealing to its ultimate landlord, Allied-Lyons, for a modest expansion. Such thoughts are prompted by two fringe productions last week: Mr Cinders at the King's Head and Waiting at the Water's Edge at The Bush. Neither is wholly satisfactory. The King's Head, which is perhaps the most eclectic of all the fringe, has had a go at Vivian Ellis's 1929 musical comedy before. It revived Mr Cinders in 1983 and saw it proceed to a successful run in the West End. It is much less clear why the piece should be revived again now, except in the hope of finding the honey pot a second time. The hope may be forlorn. In this production by Martin Connor Mr Cinders achieves the unusual distinction for a musical of slowing down whenever the music starts and speeding up whenever we return to the dialogue. The normal technique in a musical is the other way round, and while it might be original to stand convention on its head, the trouble is that the music is not quite strong enough: two pianos and some pretty thin lyrics. There are some incidental pleasures. The story - a male version of Cinderella - is a good one. Some of the lines are very amusing in a P G Wodehouse sort of way. As the hero, there is an excellent performance by Samuel West, shortly to appear in Tom Stoppard's new play Arcadia at the National Theatre. The whole cast, including Eileen Page as the grovelling Lady Lancaster, does well. Yet the question one has to ask is what is a cast of this size (17) and distinction doing in a piece like this at the King's Head? Compare Mr Cinders to the previous King's Head production, Elegies for Angels, Punks and Raging Queens. The latter had a cast of 33, and made a virtue of it. It succeeded not just because it was good in its own right, but because it was new and different. Elegies can, and should, be seen again when it moves to another fringe theatre, the Drill Hall off Tottenham Court Road, on January 19. It is what the fringe theatre ought to be about: bringing in a challenge via the back door. There is no reason why Elegies, having made its introductions, should not play on a larger stage. The problem with the new production at The Bush is that the play is over-ambitious. The Bush has recently specialised in new Irish work, notably Billy Roche's Wexford Trilogy. Lucinda Coxon's Waiting at the Water's Edge turns to Wales and Nova Scotia in the early 1920s. It is about, in no particular order, mining disasters, guilt, feminism, capitalism, class differences and the relationships between servants and masters and especially servants and mistresses. As a text, I found it pretentious, to put it mildly. Yet you have to go to The Bush, which must be the most uncomfortable of the fringe theatres in London, to see how a good production in a packed small house can take hold. Directed by Polly Teale, even some of the sillier lines and gestures almost come off. And it would be quite wrong to think that the small stage inhibits movement; sometimes it enhances it. This is a riveting experience, and one can see why actors and directors are prepared to work there, as at The Gate, almost for nothing. My point is that they have begun to deserve something better in the way of conditions. Too many people who would enjoy the fringe still do not go. How to attract them is what we should now be thinking about. Mr Cinders, King's Head, (071) 226 1916 until early February. Waiting, The Bush Theatre, (081) 743 3388 until January 30. Elegies, Drill Hall from 19 January, (071) 637 8270. * In my review of another fringe play, The Curse of the Pharaohs, at the Lyric Studio in Hammersmith last week, the parts were transposed. The excellent Egyptian is played by Adam Fahey and the equally excellent Howard Carter by Nick Rawling.</p>

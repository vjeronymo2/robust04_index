			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> CHP FIELD DEVICES TO TEST SOBRIETY  </P> <P> The California Highway Patrol is giving its officers a device enabling them to  make a preliminary judgment about whether a driver has had too much to drink.  </P> <P> Manufactured by Intoximeters Inc. of St. Louis, the 800 Alcosensor III devices  distributed to CHP offices this month will provide digital readouts of the  blood-alcohol level in drivers' systems. CHP Commissioner Maury Hannigan said  officers will ask motorists to blow into the preliminary alcohol screening  devices on a voluntary basis if they are stopped on suspicion of drunk driving  but have not been arrested. They can be arrested, however, if the readouts show  blood-alcohol levels at or above the legal standard of .08%.  </P></p>

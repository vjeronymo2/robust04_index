The occasion, in Myitkyina, will mark the  official end to armed hostilities which began when the Kachin  formed the Kachin Independence Organization and its armed wing  in 1961 to fight Rangoon for greater autonomy.    Despite a ceasefire deal, the Kachin will retain their arms  and ammunition as the two sides have yet to resolve political  issues of power sharing and greater autonomy for the Kachin  State.    Lt Gen Khin Nyunt, for the State Law and Order Restoration  Council, and the Kachin chief of staff, Brig Gen Zau Mai, will  represent their respective sides at the ceremony which will also  include some festivities.    Lt Gen Maung Thint, minister for development of border areas  and ethnic minorities, said in an interview on Friday that there  would be no signing of a truce agreement at the ceremony.    The Kachin group, like nine other armed ethnic groups which  have earlier struck ceasefire deals with Rangoon, will be  allowed to retain its weapons for safety reasons.    "There will be no signing of a peace treaty. It is like a  pledge between the government and the group and will take place  by the end of this month or beginning of next month," he said  through interpreters.    "The deal (with the Kachin) will be like that with other  groups. We will assist them as we do the other groups. We will  allow them to hold arms for their own safety, not for  hostilities, and the government has pledged to cooperate with  them in implementing development projects in their areas," he  added.    Maung Thint said that eventually a peace accord worked out  between the government and the rebel groups will include the  laying down of arms.    In an interview later the same day, Col Kyaw Win, deputy  director of the powerful Directorate of Defence Services  Intelligence, said the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) will have  to disarm itself if it wants to participate in the National  Convention, which is in the process of drawing a new  constitution, or if it wants to establish a political party.    A Kachin official, speaking during a long-distance telephone  interview yesterday, said he had no comment at the moment about  the Slorc-KIA ceasefire ceremony. He added that the KIA wants  to see a nationwide ceasefire and that it was still too early to  comment about eventual disarmament.    Col Kyaw Win said separate negotiations between Rangoon and  two remaining armed ethnic forces, the Mon and Karenni, which  are active along the Thai-Burmese border, are still in progress  and that he expects the groups to reach a ceasefire deal with  Slorc within the next two to three months. He said official  negotiations between Rangoon and the strongest remaining ethnic  rival, the Karen, could take place soon, and that the two sides  have already held preliminary talks in Thailand.    The intelligence officer said official Slorc-Karen meetings  have to be held in Burma as Rangoon considers the matter an  internal issue.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a. The noise compatibility program was developed in accordance with the provisions and procedures of FAR Part 150; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Program measures are reasonably consistent with achieving the goals of reducing existing noncompatible land uses around the airport and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  c. Program measures would not create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, unjustly discriminate against type or classes of aeronautical uses, violate the terms of airport grant agreements, or intrude into areas preempted by the federal government; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Program measures relating to the use of flight procedures can be implemented within the period covered by the program without derogating safety, adversely affecting the efficient use and management of the navigable airspace and air traffic control systems, or adversely affecting other powers and responsibilities of the Administrator prescribed by law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specific limitations with respect to FAA's approval of an airport noise compatibility program are delineated in FAR Part 150, &sect;150.5. Approval is not a determination concerning the acceptability of land uses under federal, state, or local law. Approval does not by itself constitute an FAA implementing action. A request for federal action or approval to implement specific noise compatibility measures may be required, and an FAA decision on the request may require an environmental assessment of the proposed action. Approval does not constitute a commitment by the FAA to financially assist in the implementation of the program nor a determination that all measures covered by the program are eligible for grant-in-aid funding from the FAA. Where federal funding is sought, request for project grants must be submitted to the Airports District Office at the location identified in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ``FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> clause above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The City of Modesto submitted to the FAA on June 29, 1992, the Noise Exposure Maps, descriptions, and other documentation produced during the noise compatibility planning study conducted from January 1991, through June 1992. The Modesto City-County Airport noise exposure maps were determined by FAA to be in compliance with applicable requirements on February 26, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Modesto City-County Airport Study contains proposed noise compatibility program comprised of actions designed for phased implementation by airport management and adjacent jurisdictions from the date of study completion to (or beyond) the year 2000. It was requested that the FAA evaluate and approve this material as a noise compatibility program as described in Section 104(b) of the Act. The FAA began its review of the program on November 22, 1994, and was required by a provision of the Act to approve or disapprove the program within 180-days (other than the use of new flight procedures for noise control). Failure to approve or disapprove such program within the 180-days period shall be deemed to be an approval of such a program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The submitted program contained sixteen (16) proposed actions for noise mitigation on and off the airport. The FAA completed its review and determined that the procedural and substantive requirements of the Act and FAR Part 150 have been satisfied. The overall program, therefore, was approved by the Associate Administrator for Airports effective November 22, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Outright approval was granted for fourteen (14) of the specific program elements. One (1) element was approved in part and disapproved in part. One element was a no action required at this time because it related to flight procedures. The approved elements included existing flight track policies, existing runway use program, evaluating noise-monitoring system, public information program, encouraging specific plans, consistent off airport improvement, zoning and disclosure to buyers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These determinations are set forth in detail in a Record of Approval endorsed by the Assistant Administrator for Airports on November 22, 1994. The Record of Approval, as well as other evaluation materials and the documents comprising the submittal, are available for review at the FAA office listed above at the administrative offices of Modesto. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons are invited to comment on the proposed program with specific reference to these factors. All comments, other than those properly addressed to local land use authorities, will be considered by the FAA to the extent practicable. Copies of the Noise Exposure Maps, the FAA's evaluation of the maps, and the proposed Noise Compatibility Program are available for examination at the following locations: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Room 617, Washington, DC 20591; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Aviation Administration, Western-Pacific Region, Airports Division, 15000 Aviation Boulevard, Room 3E24, Hawthorne, California, Mail: P.O.

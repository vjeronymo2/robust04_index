			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Germany to resolve east's property disputes by 1994 GERMANY said yesterday that most of the 2.4m property disputes in the former East Germany would be resolved by 1994, bringing the planned completion date forward from beyond the year 2000, Reuter reports from Berlin. Hans-Jurgen Schafer, president of the Federal Property Office, said a planned change in the law setting strict time limits on resolving disputes would speed up work. Staff have processed just 3.2 per cent of property claims since unification. The large number of outstanding claims from former East Germans on expropriations has blocked investment in the depressed region by overloading the bureaucracy.</p>

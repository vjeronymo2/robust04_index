			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Lamont angry at dismissal as Major reshapes cabinet: Clarke is promoted to chancellor - PM seeks to revive government's authority MR NORMAN LAMONT left the Treasury last night angry and embittered after Mr John Major sought to restore the battered authority of his government by replacing him as chancellor with Mr Kenneth Clarke. Ending a power struggle which had threatened to paralyse his government, the prime minister balanced the elevation of the centrist, pro-European Mr Clarke with the appointment of the rightist, Euro-sceptic Mr Michael Howard as home secretary. Mr John Redwood was the only new appointment to the cabinet, taking the post of Welsh secretary. But a reshuffle which otherwise resembled a game of political musical chairs was soured by the acrimony surrounding Mr Lamont's departure. After refusing to accept a demotion to the post of environment secretary, Mr Lamont gave public vent to his anger by issuing a terse statement in which he failed conspicuously to pledge his continuing support for Mr Major. The statement, sent by facsimile to 10 Downing Street, was a deliberately abrupt reply to a letter from the prime minister in which Mr Major praised Mr Lamont for the tough decisions he had taken during his 2 1/2 years at the Treasury. In an atmosphere reminiscent of the stormy cabinet departures that preceded Mrs Margaret Thatcher's downfall in 1990, there was speculation at Westminster that Mr Lamont might now become a champion for Mr Major's political enemies on the Conservative backbenches. Mr Lamont is an instinctive Euro-sceptic whose support for the Maastricht treaty has been grounded in pragmatism rather than enthusiasm. In his statement, Mr Lamont said he did not intend to make any further comment 'for several weeks'. He believed that 'the success of the policies I have put in place will become increasingly clear with the passage of time'. His departure after a tense 30-minute meeting with Mr Major yesterday morning followed a bitter behind-the-scenes power struggle in the highest ranks of the government. In spite of the other ministerial changes, the former chancellor and the manager in 1990 of Mr Major's leadership campaign was left in no doubt that the principal objective was his removal from the Treasury. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said the prime minister was like 'the captain of a ship throwing his first mate off the bridge as they head for the rocks'. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said Mr Lamont's move was 'a sacking dressed up as a reshuffle'. A Mori poll in today's Times showed Labour leading the Tories by 16 points. The poll showed Labour at 44 per cent, the Tories at 28 per cent and the Liberal Democrats at 24 per cent - one of their highest ratings. Mr Lamont's efforts to remain in office were overcome by the determination of Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, and Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, that he should be replaced. Some of Mr Lamont's friends suggested last night he might seek to damage the prime minister by giving his account of the events which led to sterling's departure last autumn from the European exchange rate mechanism. Mr Lamont, whose reputation never recovered from the ERM debacle, refused to accept blame for an economic strategy set in place by Mr Major. But senior ministers said that Mr Major's decisive action in sacking Mr Lamont had restored his personal political authority. To have kept him at the Treasury would have been an admission of political weakness which would have continued to drain the prime minister's personal authority and left him vulnerable to a challenge in the autumn. Mr Clarke, who alongside Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, is the most confident and powerful politician in the cabinet, is seen by a majority in the Conservative party as offering Mr Major his strongest chance of restoring the government's reputation for economic competence. Although committed to the principle of managed exchange rates, Mr Clarke has made clear that he will not risk antagonising the Tory Euro-sceptics by seeking to take sterling back into the ERM in the short to medium term. He is also expected to underline his commitment to reducing the level of public borrowing by keeping to the government's public-spending targets and continuing with the Treasury's review of the welfare state. The appointment of Mr Howard as home secretary gives him charge of the most central element in next year's legislative programme - a crackdown on crime to restore the government's tarnished reputation as a guardian of law and order. Mr Major shuffled the portfolios of six cabinet ministers and made 18 other alterations to those below cabinet rank. Among those moving were Mr John Gummer, a close ally of the prime minister. He went from agriculture to the higher-profile Environment Department. Mr David Hunt moved from the Welsh Office to the Employment Department, replacing Mrs Gillian Shephard, who became agriculture secretary.

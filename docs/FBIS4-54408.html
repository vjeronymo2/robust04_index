			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague April 28 (CTK) -- The real sense of the  recent Central European summit in Litomysl, East Bohemia, was  not in signing any declaration, but sending out "several  important political signals very essential through their  long-term implications," Czech President Vaclav Havel writes in  an article published in the independent daily LIDOVE NOVINY  today.    Presidents of seven central European countries -- Austria,  the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and  Slovenia -- met in Litomysl on April 15-16.    Havel describes the phenomenon of Central Europe as the  first  of the political signs given by the meeting. "The fact of the  summit itself, as well as the opinions expressed by the  attending presidents made it clear that the phenomenon of  Central Europe was still living and the participants in the  summit claimed to belong to Central Europe," Havel writes. "The  Central European phenomenon is far from being a subject of  cultural historians' studies, since it is a phenomenon of our  life experience...," he states. Central Europe evidently exists  as a region with its own identity, interlinked through similar  historical, cultural and social traditions, and it again plays a  considerable role from the geopolitical point of view, as it did  many times in history. It seems like it is again being decided  on where it (Central Europe) will belong and what role it will  play," Havel writes.    The summit also indicated what the views of the countries  involved concerning Central Europe's position in a broader  context were: "None of them wishes the emergence of a new  buffer zone, an apparently neutral area between the West and the  East (such zones usually become the first battle-fields in case  of a confrontation), or a bridge linking somebody to somebody  else (bridges are often places of battle and subjects of  fighting as well)," Havel writes.    He also stresses that no Central European country wants to  find itself in "Russia's sphere of influence", and have any  "specific relations" towards Russia, mainly in the defence  sphere. "Nobody, of course, defines themselves in contrast to  Russia or wants to isolate Russia; on the contrary, everybody  wants relations with this country to be the best imaginable --  relations based on equality, on Russia's respecting its  partners' belonging where they want to belong," Havel states.    "We view Central Europe as the integral part of Europe which  is rather inexactly called Western Europe or the West," he  continues. "It is extremely important that Litomysl has sent out  this joint Central European 'signal' now, when tones indicating  -- though in a very diplomatic, veiled manner -- Russia's  certain specific claim and interest concerning the area of its  former satellites, are emerging in Russian foreign policy,"  Havel stresses.    Another signal "sent out" by the Litomysl meeting: All  countries involved respect each other and are able to  communicate not only at bilateral level but also jointly. "Even  various specific neighbour controversies cannot prevent them  from reflecting their essential interest both in good mutual  neighbour relations and the existence of joint interests," Havel  writes, adding that this is "considerable" with the Central  European region whose ethnic structure is so complicated and  which was so many times in the past politically divided and  internally antagonised.    Moreover, discussion based on equality between  representatives of five postcommunist countries, one influential  member of the European Union (EU) and NATO, and one EU potential  member indicates a certain historical shift: It is no longer a  meeting of only postcommunist countries aimed to discuss tactics  against the West, ...but a meeting which does not accent the  communist past of some participants and the democratic past of  the others, "a meeting of countries claiming to adhere to a  specific historical and cultural region and to the same basic  political values," Havel states.    The summit also made it clear that neither our "application  to Western Europe meant our application to a sort of German  sphere of influence, nor Germany's interest in stability,  security and the development of its Eastern neighbours meant a  latent building of a sphere of the German interest in power,"  Havel emphasises. At the meeting, German President Richard von  Weizsacker "strived almost anxiously" to make it clear that in  intensively supporting the integration of its eastern neighbours  into European structures, Germany wanted to contribute to the  common interest, to support the interest of its eastern  neighbours, the EU and NATO -- simply the interests of the whole  of Europe, not to pursue power interests of its own, Havel  writes. "Briefly: Germany neither is nor wants to be a patron  of Central Europe, nor somebody separating us from the liberal  West, but on the contrary, the one to link us with the West most  markedly of all," Havel stresses.    The summit has also indicated which values ranked among  those  linking us to the West, such as democracy, market economy, law-  abiding state, and mainly the civic principle in the building of  the state, the civic society. The civic orientation is the only  one to "lead us forever out of the darkness of nationalist  thick- headedness, which is the source of endless human  suffering. Our application to Europe is therefore an  application to the coexistence of nations, nationalities and  ethnic groups on the principle of equality. "Maybe it could be  said that the quicker the pace of Central Europeans on this path  would be, the quicker the idea of tolerance and solidarity would  spread further to the south and east of Europe," Havel writes.    Good personal relations and real friendship between  politicians are more important in politics than they seem to be  when observed from outside, he writes, adding that the "human  dimension of politics" characteristic of the Litomysl talks, was  of priceless benefit to all the attending countries.    It seems the Litomysl summit will not be the last meeting of  this sort, as presidents of the seven involved countries would  meet regularly. No emergence of a new international pact can be  expected. "But if this becomes a certain tradition, it will  undoubtedly be another instrument for the creation of a good  atmosphere in Europe," Havel concludes.</p>

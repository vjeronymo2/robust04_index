			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh 17 May (AKP) -- Prince Krompreah Norodom  Ranariddh, first prime minister of the Royal Government of  Cambodia, on Monday, 16 May, rejected a report alleging that the  Khmer Rouge [KR] had taken control of Mongkolborei, a town  located in northwestern Cambodia.    During a conversation with journalists following the  inauguration of an artificial limb-making center in Phnom Penh,  the prince indicated that the guerrillas had destroyed a bridge  and an administrative office of Mongkolborei District, but it  was just a "lightning" operation.    The radio of the Khmer Rouge affirmed that three columns of  guerrillas had attacked government positions on 15 May near the  Mongkolborei bridge in the town's market and along the river  south of the town on National Route 5.    According to the radio, the "liberation" of Mongkolborei  enables the Khmer Rouge to control the transport and  communications between Battambang and Sisophon and between  Sisophon and Poipet.    The radio also affirmed that on 14 May the guerrillas had  occupied Sangkum Thmei District in Preah Vihear Province, north  of Mongkolborei.</p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Florida May Target Fresh Fruit Market: The Florida Department of Citrus is  considering spending $5.7 million on a national advertising campaign to  persuade shoppers that Florida oranges are equal to their California  counterparts. The advertising campaign in 1990 and 1991 would be aimed at  cutting into the California navel orange market, which produces more than 75%  of all fresh oranges eaten in the U.S. About 95% of Florida's oranges are  squeezed into juice.  </P></p>

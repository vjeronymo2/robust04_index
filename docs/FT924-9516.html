			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Illumination from the stars - A look at the new-found respectability of so-called 'infomercials' Insomniacs will be forgiven for thinking they are having nightmares when faced with the late-night television image of Dionne Warwick offering a direct line to psychics through the Psychic Friends Network. Only marginally more disconcerting is the sight of Michael Landon, the 'Bonanza' and 'Little House on the Prairie' actor, touting the benefits of a study-aid video series called 'Where There's a Will There's an A'. Landon died last year. The growing celebrity presence in infomercials - a form of direct response marketing generally presented in the format of half-hour television talk shows or news programmes - bears testament to the medium's new-found respectability after languishing for years in the nether world of advertising. Product sales through infomercials are estimated to be at least Dollars 500m (Pounds 306m) this year, and may run as high as Dollars 1bn. Infomercials in the US began in 1984 when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) deregulated the amount of time that broadcast stations could dedicate to advertisements. They quickly became a popular forum for advertising dubious products such as miracle cures for baldness and impotence. So prominent were the charlatans in the infomercial sector, that they threatened the industry's survival. There have been dozens of lawsuits brought by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and consumer advocate groups alleging deceptive advertising. As a result, the industry set up an internal watchdog agency, the National Infomercial Merchandising Association, in 1990. It offers guidelines against deceptive practices, endorses legitimate producers and reports violations to the FTC. Infomercial makers have also started to employ euphemisms such as 'long-form marketing programmes' and 'direct response television' in an attempt to distance themselves from their disreputable past. The very format, however, presents problems by blurring the line between advertising and regular television programming. 'I thought I was watching a cooking show,' said a colleague, who ended up buying an authentic, hand-hammered wok. 'I was tired and it seemed cheap.' The recession's impact on the US entertainment industry may explain why late-night TV viewers now see Larry Hagman and Cher discussing haircare products. Celebrities can be paid about Dollars 250,000 for a role in an infomercial, as well as receiving a percentage of the sales. It is estimated that Cher was paid about Dollars 1m for her part in selling 'Aquasentials' haircare products. Money is not the only lure. Martin Sheen reportedly is unpaid for his performance in an infomercial for 'Personal Power' self-help tapes because he believes in the product. Jane Fonda uses infomercials to promote her step work-out and Victoria Principal uses them to sell her skincare line. Advertisers are drawn to infomercials by the low cost - a 30-minute infomercial can cost roughly the same as a 30-second network advertising spot because of differences in production and airtime costs. The industry is hoping to cement its legitimacy by attracting more mainstream players. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi last year formed a partnership with Regal Communications, the largest US infomercial producer, to study infomercials, but the venture has yet to sign any of Saatchi's leading clients. A number of large advertisers have also experimented with the infomercial format. Earlier this year, Volvo ran an infomercial on safety in southern California, but the company decided the response was not strong enough to air its infomercial nationally. Similarly, Club Med has decided to stick with its traditional 30-second advertising format after a brief foray into infomercials this year. While the prospects of luring a significant number of large advertisers to the infomercial arena remain dim, at least in the short-term, the prospects are good for industry growth overall thanks to the rapid expansion of US cable television systems. Direct response marketing via television infomercials is also making inroads into the increasingly complex world of European media. One of the companies leading the fray is Quantum International, a subsidiary of National Media, based in Philadelphia. Quantum is licensed by the UK's Independent Television Commission, and currently broadcasts programmes via three European channels: Lifestyle and Screensport (both on the Astra satellite) and Super Channel (on Eutelsat). Their footprints extend from Scandinavia to north Africa, from west Europe to Russia and beyond. The three channels are each reaching up to 30m homes. Quantum takes programmes produced by its US parent and re-edits them for European use. But it is branching out into producing its own infomercials which, in turn, will be taken by National Media. Infomercials broadcast across Europe face big obstacles which their US counterparts need be less concerned with: language and cultural differences, a plethora of legislation affecting product claims, advertising and packaging, which vary greatly from country to country. According to David Carman, Quantum's president: 'Europeans seem to demand a higher standard of packaging, quality, value for money and service (than American audiences). All instructions (on the products) must be translated into all languages; products must meet all regulations whether EC or local; and our programmes are dubbed into different languages, currently German, French, Dutch and Swedish.' Several factors are likely to influence the growth of infomercials in Europe. Commercial development of digital compression will mean more air time is available on existing satellites. As both terrestrial and satellite broadcasting becomes more cluttered and fragmented, advertisers will need either more sophisticated research or much larger budgets to ensure they are reaching their putative purchasers. No one is forecasting a return to the high-spending television advertising budgets of the early 1980s.</p>

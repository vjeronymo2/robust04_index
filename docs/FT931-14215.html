			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Trading in YSL halted amid stake sale speculation TRADING in the shares in Yves Saint Laurent, the fashion and cosmetics company, and Elf-Sanofi were suspended yesterday amid speculation that YSL might be selling a significant share stake to Elf-Sanofi. Elf-Sanofi, the pharmaceuticals and beauty products arm of the state-owned Elf-Aquitaine oil group, promised a statement and a press conference early this afternoon to explain the new development. Officials at YSL were unavailable yesterday, but their president, Mr Pierre Berge, has made no secret of his desire to sell up to 15 per cent of the company. Mr Berge's openness last autumn about his willingness to sell a significant stake to a 'true partner' had led to some softening of the company's share price, and criticism from YSL minority investors. However, in the past four weeks, YSL's shares have gained nearly a third, and yesterday's suspension came after a sizeable rise last Friday. Several months ago, Elf-Sanofi was canvassed as a possible buyer of the shares jointly-owned by Mr Saint Laurent and Mr Berge, but was said to have been ruled out because it was unwilling to leave the company's two founders in management control. Elf-Sanofi is essentially a pharmaceuticals company, but it has a perfume and beauty products business centred around its four marques of Roger &amp; Gallet, Stendhal, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels and Oscar de la Renta. The Elf-Aquitaine group is itself a possible candidate for privatisation if French conservatives win the March parliamentary election. In the first nine months of last year, Elf-Sanofi recorded a 12.5 per cent rise in turnover to FFr15.8bn (Dollars 2.85bn), while YSL's predominantly luxury business has been much harder hit by the economic turndown with profits falling to just FFr2.6m in the first half of last year on sales of FFr1.39bn.</p>

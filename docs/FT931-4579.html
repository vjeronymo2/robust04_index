			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / International Company News: Hees hit by exposure to Trustco THE TWO most important holding companies in Canada's Edper-Hees group reported sharply lower profits for 1992 because of provisions to cover their exposure to troubled Royal Trustco and other units in the group. Hees International Bancorp's profit fell to CDollars 36.3m (USDollars 29.4m) from CDollars 178.4m in 1991, after a special CDollars 91.4m provision. Hees International is at the top of the Edper Bronfman empire. Brascan, the other holding company, reported a loss of CDollars 113.4m after provisions, against a CDollars 17.7m loss in 1991. Both companies have significant holdings in Trilon Financial, which in turn controls Royal Trustco, Canada's second-biggest trust company, which is negotiating to sell most of its business to Royal Bank of Canada. Trilon reported a nine-month loss of CDollars 227m but has yet to report for the whole year. Royal Trustco has delayed its full-year results until talks with the Royal Bank are completed. Edper-Hees also controls London Life, the depressed property developers Carena, Trizec and Bramalea, and Canada's biggest resource group, Noranda. Its controlling stake in John Labatt, the brewer, was sold last month for nearly CDollars 1bn. The Hees provision included its share of charges made by the property units.</p>

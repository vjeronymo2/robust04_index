			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: PowerGen No doubt times are getting tougher in the electricity generation business. But PowerGen's disclosure of Pounds 88m of exceptional income yesterday is a reminder that monopoly profits are not necessarily extinct. The figure, which excludes a central overhead contribution, reflects the price extracted by the company for guaranteeing essential electricity supplies to the National Grid. At the very least it will interest Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry's regulator, who is busy examining complaints from distributors that these so-called uplift charges are excessive. It might even put pressure on National Power to set out its own numbers in more detail next week. Exceptionals aside, the underlying picture at PowerGen is what one might expect. For the moment it has guaranteed margins of 15 to 20 per cent thanks to its pre-flotation contracts, but has improved on that due to substantial cost reductions and increased direct sales to industrial customers. The market's focus, however, is on the re-contracting negotiations with British Coal on the one hand and the 12 regional electricity companies on the other. PowerGen was anxious to assure listeners yesterday that all will be well and that the uncertainty should not be overplayed. But while this confidence should not be discounted, the longer the talks drag on the greater the danger that new terms will end up closer to the pool price. The generators may appear to have British Coal over a barrel, but the regional companies will surely be cautious until the regulator has made his position clear. PowerGen's 11 per cent dividend increase puts the shares on an average market yield, which seems enough until confirmation arrives that such rises can be sustained.</p>

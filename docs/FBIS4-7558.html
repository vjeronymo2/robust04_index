			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 31 Mar (MTI) -- President Arpad Goncz met  Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in parliament on  Thursday.    Summing up the talks, Presidential Spokesman Andras Farago  said Goncz believed that business links between the two  countries could be increased now that the necessary legal and  institutional conditions have been created. The next step will  be to work out an investment protection agreement and improve  financial and bank relations. The president praised  Chernomyrdin for his balancing role in Russia's political and  economic life.    Chernomyrdin stressed that Russia was striving for economic  and political stability in consideration of Hungary's reform  experience. At the same time, Moscow is aware that it is  impossible to introduce a pure market economy overnight in the  face of such difficult tasks as, for instance, privatization and  military industry conversion, the Russian prime minister said.    After meeting with Goncz, Chernomyrdin laid a wreath at the  memorial of Soviet soldiers in Freedom Square and at the  Hungarian heroes' monument in Heroes Square.    Chernomyrdin will begin his Friday programme at the  Szekesfehervar (central Hungary) unit of the Ikarus bus factory.  He will continue in Budapest with representatives of Hungarian  economic and financial life.    In the afternoon, several documents will be signed in  Parliament, after which Chernomyrdin and Boross will hold an  international press conference.</p>

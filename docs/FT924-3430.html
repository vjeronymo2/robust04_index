			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: A fortifying deal It must have come as a relief to Forte to have found a buyer for its Gardner Merchant contract catering business after the embarrassing collapse of its deal with Compass. In theory the way is now open for the long-mooted diversification in continental Europe. As if to underline that point, Forte also yesterday announced a motorway restaurant deal with Accor in France. Later this week will come the formal announcement of its hotel venture with Agip in Italy. At long last Mr Rocco Forte has a firm answer to investors who have accused him of dithering over strategic direction. One looks in vain, however, for much by way of additional earnings in the short run. True, the Gardner Merchant sale will produce a one-off contribution above the line of some Pounds 250m after adjustment for goodwill. The proceeds will reduce group debt, but the interest savings will be more than offset by the loss of Gardner's contribution. Forte is targeting a 30 per cent annual return for its residual equity stake, thanks to the high gearing involved in the venture. It will have to wait until flotation in four years' time to realise much of that gain. As for Europe, Forte is positioning itself to become a leading player in motorway services but its hotel strategy is less convincing. Investment will be needed in both areas before they make a significant contribution. Forte has discovered some ingenious ways of expanding in Europe without committing much cash but necessity is the mother of invention. Interest cover will remain low despite the Gardner Merchant sale. Forte still badly needs a recovery in its basic hotel business and it is starting to look as though it could be 1994 before that takes strong hold. On that basis the shares look over-priced.</p>

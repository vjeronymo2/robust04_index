			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (18): Fossils still have plenty of power - With Siemens' thermal generating equipment made mostly in high-wage Germany, the company has to fight harder to remain competitive among the world's top five producers / Steam Turbines While some of the technologies in Siemens' medical systems business are no more than a decade or two old, the fossil power side of the company's KWU power generation business has roots going back to 1866 when Werner von Siemens discovered the dynamoelectric principle. But for Prof Klaus Riedle, executive director of the Erlangen-based fossil power unit, the challenges of running the business are modern. It is one of the big five competitors in an increasingly global market for power generating equipment, but has a much higher proportion of its workforce in the high cost centre of Germany than its rivals. With some 10,000 of its 12,000 workers worldwide employed in Germany, Prof Riedle says: 'We will have to make our German plants more competitive.' In Germany, the fossil power business makes large steam turbines and turbogenerators at Mulheim on the Ruhr, smaller generators in Erfurt, gas turbines in Berlin, and industrial turbines at Wesel and Gorlitz. Overseas it has a factory in Milwaukee which makes smaller gas turbines and generators, a gas turbine joint venture in St Petersburg and a components manufacturing company in Indonesia. The spread of manufacturing gives a clue as to how the company is trying to reduce its manufacturing costs. Prof Riedle sees two ways of doing this: one is by decreasing the proportion of added value in its products contributed by its older, domestic factories, implying the use of cheaper manufacturing locations in Europe or elsewhere. The second, closely-related approach is to combine manufacture of the equipment with low cost producers, hence the joint ventures such as in Indonesia. The company is negotiating others joint ventures in Asia for manufacturing steam turbines and generators, says Prof Riedle. KWU's long-running negotiations with Skoda in the Czech republic, for example, are based around the premise that a lower-cost country can produce a number of parts for a turbine more efficiently than the German factories, provided quality is maintained and the logistics of marrying up parts for the same turbine are addressed. Parts such as casings or those involving labour-intensive welding are ideal, but Siemens could move progressively to a much higher proportion of manufacturing at Skoda if the deal is signed. Already, it has moved in this direction on gas turbine manufacturing at Milwaukee. 'Step by step we have increased the added value to half and half, split between the two sites of Berlin and Milwaukee,' says Prof Riedle. All gas turbines for the 60Hz market, North America and parts of Asia, are now leaving KWU via Milwaukee. Meanwhile, considerable improvement efforts have been made over the past decade in the German plants. This began with rationalisation programmes, where each factory had to save 2-3 per cent of its costs through rationalisation each year. Realising that this was not enough, the company introduced productivity packages at its factories, but these tended to focus on discrete stages of the production process, for example the manufacture of turbine blades, rather than viewing it in its entirety. A third productivity programme was introduced three years ago, therefore, which considered the process in its entirety, from receipt of an order to dispatch of the product. The aim of the productivity improvements is to keep Prof Riedle's unit firmly in the Premier League of an industry where the financial implications of productivity and lean production techniques have never been greater. Prof Riedle admits that the KWU fossil power business still has a long way to go. It has never cut its domestic workforce by more than 1-2 per cent a year, but more severe reductions are foreseen over the next few years in engineering and manufacturing jobs in Germany. Meanwhile, with orders increasingly being won on the basis of a supplier's ability to deliver more quickly, the efforts made by Siemens in reducing production cycle times, and the overall time to build a power station, are particularly important. Already it has made considerable progress. It built the recently completed Rye House combined cycle power station in south-east England in 30 months, compared with an average three and a half years in the 1980s, and the next step will be 24 months, says Prof Riedle. Cycle times for large steam turbines are down from 30 months to under two years, and could be reduced to 18 months for standard machines, he says. Because of the importance of combined cycle power stations, a new effort was launched a year ago to benchmark the business on its performance producing these gas-fired power stations. Here it is judging itself against a 'synthetic' competitor combining all the best qualities of its four big rivals - General Electric and Westinghouse of the US, and the two other European giants, Asea Brown Boveri and GEC Alsthom. Prof Riedle believes no single competitor has all the answers, and believes Siemens can achieve the goals set out in the benchmarking process in three years. With rivals making advances all the time he is clearly determined that Siemens will not lose ground.</p>

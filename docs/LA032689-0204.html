"It's going to be a marathon of tennis (Sunday). We're just going to be jamming  all day."  </P> <P> The contingency plan, provided rain does not interfere today, translates into a  19-match schedule beginning at 7:15 a.m. The championship final is scheduled to  begin at 1 p.m. at the UC Irvine tennis stadium. Other matches are scheduled to  be played at the Newport Marriott, the Mesa Verde Tennis Club, the Balboa Bay  Club, the Racquet Club of Irvine and Christ College Irvine.  </P> <P> All games in the Pony softball tournament scheduled to be played Saturday at  Cal State Fullerton were postponed until today.  </P> <P> In the championship-round games, Cal State Fullerton, ranked No. 5 in the  nation, will play Arizona, ranked No. 10, at 9:30 a.m. Akron plays Cal State  Long Beach, ranked No. 11, also at 9:30.  </P> <P> No. 3 Oklahoma State plays Cal Poly Pomona at 11 a.m., and No. 1 ranked Fresno  State plays Texas A&amp;M, also at 11.  </P> <P> Semifinal games are scheduled for 1 p.m. and the championship game is scheduled  for 2:30 p.m. today.  </P> <P> Also because of rain, the site of today's nonconference baseball game between  UC Irvine and Minnesota has been changed from Irvine to Loyola Marymount, and  the game will be played at 11 a.m. instead of noon.  </P> <P> And the final games of the Saddleback College baseball tournament Saturday were  canceled.  </P></p>

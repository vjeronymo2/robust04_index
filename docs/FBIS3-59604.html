However, another possibility is the evaluation of  gravimetric and magnetic fields which supposedly can be measured  quickly and inexpensively. Now, a software system called Igmas  which was developed at the Free University of Berl in (Dr.  Hans-Juergen Goetze, Institut fuer Geologie, Malteserstr.  74-100, 12249 Berlin) allows the three-dimensional interactive  evaluation of these measurements.    As Professor Goetze explains, the gravity and magnetic  fields  are changed by anomalies in the geological structure.  Identification of these anomalies using high-resolution  measuring instruments is relatively quick and simple so that  these anomalies can be used for the exploration of deposits.  However, complex calculations are required to relate the local  geological formations to the measured anomalies.    These types of calculations require an enormous amount of  computing time. Therefore, it was not possible until now to  obtain a clear picture of the geological conditions based on the  anomalies of the local gravity or magnetic fields. So far, such  evaluations were used only to confirm the results of seismic  methods.    According to Goetz, Igmas is able to provide a much more  detailed evaluation of the anomalies measurements. Basically,  the program uses the representation of geological structures as  three-dimensional polyhedrons of any shape. The user models the  geological structures until the calculated anomalies agree with  the measured values.    As Goetze reports, the result is then illustrated on the  screen which greatly facilitates the search for a potential  deposit site. Igmas can also be used for the interpretation of  gravimetric well hole measurements.    The program has interfaces to connect to conventional  seismic  evaluation programs and therefore allows a complex  interpretation of the measured values. Igmas can also be used  for environmental purposes such as waste dump and cavity studies.</p>

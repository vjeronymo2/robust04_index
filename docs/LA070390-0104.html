			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LABOR: DRUG TESTING SAFEGUARDS NEEDED  </P> <P> Shamefully, the use of illicit drugs in this country supports a  multibillion-dollar criminal empire ruled by drug lords, and that generally  accepted fact is bad enough.  </P> <P> But the Bush Administration, in its zeal to attack the problem, has repeatedly  exaggerated and misused statistics about drug use in the workplace and its  financial impact.  </P> <P> The hype is leading to a major increase in testing that is not highly reliable.  That can cause serious problems for workers, who can be fired, or not hired,  because tests erroneously indicate that they use drugs. Also, testing is  expensive for employers who pay for it and who can face costly legal action by  workers falsely accused of taking drugs.  </P> <P> There are ways that testing can be used to combat the problem, but not nearly  enough is being done to safeguard workers who are tested.  </P> <P> The rush to test workers stems in part from badly flawed studies that were used  to provide President Bush and federal drug czar William J. Bennett with the  widely disseminated statistic that drug abuse costs American industry at least  $60 billion a year.  </P> <P> John Horgan, an editor of the authoritative publication, Scientific American,  ridicules the basic study used to get the estimate, saying it was statistically  illogical.  </P> <P> The study surveyed 3,700 households in 1982, asking if any member at any time  had used marijuana daily for at least 20 days in any 30-day period. Households  with a heavy marijuana user earned 28% less than families with no heavy users.  </P> <P> Then came the big jump to the conclusion that the income difference was caused  solely by the families' "reduced productivity due to daily marijuana use" at  some time by at least one family member.  </P> <P> Horgan noted that the difference could have been caused by many other factors,  such as family size. The more family members, the greater the odds that one may  have used marijuana, and large families often have low incomes.  </P> <P> Besides, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which developed the figure,  acknowledges that it really only showed the potential loss of income to  families with a drug-using member, not a real loss to American industry.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, to dramatize the extent of the problem, the Administration  extrapolated the family sample to get a national figure and proclaimed that  workplace drug use was costing all of American industry $27 billion.  </P> <P> Then that figure was inflated by adding estimated costs of drug-related crimes  and inflation and population growth since 1982. Up came the frightening  estimate that workplace drugs today cost American companies $60 billion a year.  Bush at times rounds the figure off to a neat $100 billion.  </P> <P> Strangely, the same 1982 survey included a question about current drug use. The  answer, mostly ignored, showed no significant difference between the incomes of  households with current users of marijuana, cocaine or heroin and incomes of  households that had no users.  </P> <P> Despite the Administration's politically potent scare tactics to increase drug  testing, we cannot act as though there is no real drug problem. There is.  </P> <P> Trouble comes in the slapdash way that many worried companies try to cope with  the problem. Finally, however, some -- but not enough -- curbs are being  applied on the rush to testing.  </P> <P> The conservative California Supreme Court recently let stand lower court  rulings that, under California's constitutionally protected right of privacy,  employers cannot fire or otherwise punish workers who refuse to submit to  random drug tests.  </P> <P> We should hope that other states will follow California's lead, as they often  do.  </P> <P> As important as the court ruling was, it still allows companies to continue  giving drug tests to job applicants and those in safety-related jobs. And that  leaves a large number of workers vulnerable to rejection or dismissal because  of false test results.  </P> <P> Also, workers can be labeled drug users if they take a legally prescribed  medicine -- or even a poppy-seed bagel -- that can produce the same test result  as an illegal substance.  </P> <P> Few employers bother or can afford to offer a second test to check for  mistakes, although responsible companies avoid those pitfalls by offering  repeat tests and using only certified, reliable testing companies.  </P> <P> Eric Greenberg at American Management Assn. says 51.5% of all medium-sized and  large companies already do some kind of testing, and that means that it is more  urgent than ever for Congress to enact strict safeguards to protect workers  from abuse by testing.  </P> <P> Limited, non-random testing can assist the war on drugs. But it must be done  with great care, and government-mandated counseling and drug rehabilitation  must be offered, with the help of federal funds.  </P> <P> One system that seems sensible, especially for dangerous occupations, was  negotiated recently by four building trades unions representing 100,000 workers  and four Southern California construction associations. It provides fairly  strong safeguards for workers' rights.  </P> <P> Under the agreement, no random testing is allowed, and tests can be required  only for "reasonable cause" based on evidence of suspicious on-the-job behavior  observed by a supervisor and a worker or union representative.  </P> <P> Workers who test positive must be given a second test and, if they still  contend that there has been a mistake, they can appeal through the  industry-union grievance procedure.  </P> <P> Those who must take the test get it at a facility agreed on by the company and  union. Those who pass, including job applicants, must be paid for any lost  time.  </P> <P> Current employees who fail the test can go through a rehabilitation program; if  they complete it successfully, they are rehired.  </P> <P> Controlled testing is often approved of by workers who can be endangered by  drug users. Douglas McCarron, head of the carpenters district council, who  helped negotiate the construction industry testing system for this area, says  his members overwhelmingly voted for it.  </P> <P> That system, and probably no other, is going to eliminate drug use in the  workplace. But then the problem isn't nearly as horrendous as the Bush  Administration contends.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VICE VERSA: WEAKNESS INTO ART;  </P> <P> T. S. ELIOT AND PREJUDICE BY CHRISTOPHER RICKS (UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRESS:  $25; 290 PP.; 0-520-06578-6)  </P> <P> In 1933, the poet Thomas Stearns Eliot gave a series of lectures in Virginia,  eventually to be published under the title "After Strange Gods." The lectures  focused on the importance of a cultural tradition, specifically the American  tradition in the Southern states, but the lectures will be remembered more for  furthering the charges of Eliot's anti-Semitism than the cause of tradition.  </P> <P> Controversy centers on a passage about the need for stability in a society  developing a tradition: "The population should be homogeneous. . . . What is  still more important is unity of religious background; and reasons of race and  religion combine to make any large number of free-thinking Jews undesirable. .  . ."  </P> <P> There also are early poems, such as "Burbank With a Baedeker: Bleistein With a  Cigar," that express anti-Semitism: "The rats are underneath the piles./The Jew  is underneath the lot."  </P> <P> Combined with these, the statement about "free-thinking Jews" has made  anti-Semitism as lasting a part of Eliot's legacy as his receipt of the Nobel  Prize for Literature in 1948. But Christopher Ricks reconsiders the  controversy.  </P> <P> In Eliot's prose and poetry, Ricks finds a sensibility struggling to  rationalize its own prejudice and the nature of prejudice in general. "Eliot is  from the beginning preoccupied with prejudice because it constitutes an  intersection of philosophy, psychology, politics, and art." It also is a  struggle that Eliot did not always win.  </P> <P> Ricks does what is needed to an issue that has sat, growing in its own  sensationalism, for the last 50 years. There is no doubt about his appreciation  for Eliot's mastery as a poet, but he does not excuse Eliot's anti-Semitism  either. What Ricks offers are explanations, acknowledging their incompleteness,  that may help us toward an understanding not only of Eliot's biases but of  prejudice in general.  </P> <P> This position has been challenged by Leon Wieseltier, and Ricks addresses  Wieseltier in the book. Wieseltier says the horror of the Holocaust cannot be  explained. The victims of that brutality are innocent; "it came unbidden from  the outside." To understand the issue would mean assigning the victim a part in  the cause, but Wieseltier argues "when the victim is an accomplice, evil is --  banal."  </P> <P> The brutality of the Holocaust certainly makes discussions of anti-Semitism  difficult in this century. But if we accept Wieseltier's argument, Ricks says,  prejudice becomes irrational, and this abolishes "the chances of the rational  reduction of prejudice." To treat it rationally, no matter what the pitfalls,  is to maintain the chances for change.  </P> <P> But understanding prejudice is easier in theory than in practice. Ricks devotes  a long chapter to the nature of prejudice. What is discussed, supported with  the work of Edmund Burke and William Godwin in the 18th Century, is the  necessity of prejudice.  </P> <P> Ricks draws on many interesting sources for his information. William James'  observation on the conformity of young professionals shows, gratifyingly, that  my generation is not responsible for the yuppie. Allan Bloom, sounding  controversial but actually making good sense, says he tries to teach prejudice  to his students. For him, it is important that his students believe in  something before they learn to doubt.  </P> <P> The enormity of the issue creates an attitude in the book similar to "He that  is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone." What Ricks is doing is  deflating our tendency to sit in judgment of another person's supposed guilt.  </P> <P> Is the tone of the lines "In the room the women come and go/Talking of  Michelangelo" from Eliot's "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" obvious?  Literary critics Hugh Kenner, Helen Gardner and Grover Smith are assured that  the speaker is condescending. Gardner and Kenner hear whiny feminine voices,  while Smith says the women talk "no doubt tediously and ignorantly." Ricks  shows that these assurances are unfounded; the lines are actually very  toneless, and open to many interpretations. It is a lesson to us that even our  critics, trusted for their explanations, are not infallible.  </P> <P> This ambiguity is not accidental, nor is Eliot unaware that he is loading the  title of his first volume of verse with a clunker, "Prufrock." He knew what the  name would do to people's expectations of a poem called a "love song." It was  Eliot's way of showing how easily we make judgments, even on the basis of a  name; "how so little information controls so much behavior." Already with his  first volume, Eliot was winking at the public's predictability, and making  satire of it.  </P> <P> One convincing argument concerning anti-Semitism in Eliot's poetry is treating  it in relation to content. An error that readers make, and Eliot exploits, is  to assume the printed word always reflects the true feelings of the author,  when it may be only the dramatic persona's.  </P> <P> The speaker of "Gerontion" is a sick man with a "dry brain," living in a  decaying house (house so often is a metaphor for the body). A person in such a  rotting condition may foster a questionable perception of the world. When we  read that "the Jew squats on the window sill, the owner," we must remember the  questionable mental state of the speaker. In fact, in much of the poetry cited  for instances of anti-Semitism, Ricks says, the narrator's authority is  questionable.  </P> <P> Other explanations are connected to Eliot's relationship with his father. Eliot  grew up in a Unitarian household, the son of a strict father, and William  Empson interprets Eliot's anti-Semitism as a symbolic repudiation of his father  and his father's religion.  </P> <P> Empson takes Eliot's opinion that the Jewish religion, liberalized, becomes a  "colourless form of Unitarianism" and says, "If you are hating a purse-proud  businessman who denies that Jesus is God, into what stereotype does he best  fit? He is a Jew. . . ."  </P> <P> Ricks' own opinion is more tactful. One of the more offensive poems, "Dirge"  ("Full fathom five your Bleistein lies/Under the flatfish and the squids"), was  a poem Eliot never published -- it happened after his death -- and he never  permitted a second printing of "After Strange Gods." Ricks sees in these  actions a recognition of his mistakes. And this is the premise that guides the  second half of the book, taking him from "The Waste Land" to "Four Quartets."  </P> <P> In doing this, Ricks takes us and the concept of prejudice into the mechanics  of poetry. Eliot's meticulous care for the formation of lines is discussed in  relation to his influences, Shakespeare and Dante. Ricks recognizes Eliot's  debt to them, while still maintaining the innovation Eliot made in 20th-Century  poetry.  </P> <P> Ricks' careful attention to Eliot's poetics is a joy to read. He enhances the  poetry for those who, when they read poetry, whip through it as if it were a  faster-format newspaper.  </P> <P> It would not be inappropriate if his book were subtitled something like "A  study in the art of making poetry," because he illustrates the poet's tools  better than one would expect (due to a prejudgment, no doubt?) in a book about  prejudice.  </P> <P> It is clear from this study that poetry, in a sense, requires prejudice. Poetry  is the synthesis of the poet's words with the reader's comprehension. Most  often with drama, the artist deliberately leaves mood up to the actor. An  expression like "Ah, soldier!" from Shakespeare's "Antony and Cleopatra" has  many interpretations. The woman utters it after Cleopatra's death, and then she  dies too. So is this a cry of pain? Or does she mourn the queen's death?  </P> <P> Eliot's struggle with prejudice is connected to his belief that weaknesses  could be turned into art. He once said of Dostoevsky that he studied his  epilepsy and hysteria in order to open up a "personal universe." Ricks says the  same of Eliot. And this self-contemplation of human spirit, Ricks reminds us,  also includes "human personality at its lowest." The low points for Eliot are  when anti-Semitism finds expression in his poetry.  </P> <P> In the entire study, the area excluded, surprisingly, is Eliot's anti-Irish  sentiment. "Apeneck Sweeney," a stereotype of the violent, uneducated Irishman,  appears many times in Eliot's poems, but is overlooked here. However, Ricks  says more biographical inquiry into Eliot's life is needed, and maybe this will  be a part of the next study to penetrate even further into Eliot's "Gioconda  smile."  </P></p>

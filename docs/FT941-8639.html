			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Relyon warns on profits Directors of Relyon Group, the beds and furniture manufacturer, warned yesterday that its annual results would be adversely affected by non-recurring costs. They estimated that pre-tax profits for the 12 months to December 31 would be reduced by some Pounds 700,000 by the items, which include costs of withdrawal from its French operation and redundancy payments following reorganisation. The bottom line would also suffer from a higher than expected tax charge, following payment of a tax liability dating back to 1984-85. They emphasised, however, that the underlying trading performance was in line with expectations and that the current year had started well.</p>

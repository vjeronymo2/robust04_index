			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE FAVORS VOIDING PROP. 65 FOOD, DRUG EXEMPTION  </P> <P> A Sacramento Superior Court judge indicated Tuesday that he is likely to throw  out a state regulation that exempts foods, drugs and cosmetics from the  requirements of California's antitoxics law.  </P> <P> In a tentative decision, Judge Ronald B. Robie said the regulation granting the  exemption is "not consistent" with Proposition 65 and therefore "is invalid on  its face."  </P> <P> But Robie withheld final action to scrap the controversial regulation until  attorneys representing the state, environmentalists and industry groups can  file another round of written arguments.  </P> <P> Removal of the exemption, which is sought by environmentalists and organized  labor, would lead to consumer warnings for products that pose a "significant  risk" of causing cancer or reproductive harm.  </P> <P> Representatives of the food, drug and cosmetics industries have fought hard to  keep the exemption, but they have refused to say what products, if any, would  fail to meet the standards of Proposition 65.  </P> <P> The state Health and Welfare Agency, after persistent lobbying by the Grocery  Manufacturers of America and other industry groups, adopted the regulation in  February, 1988, granting an exemption to all foods, drugs, cosmetics and  medical devices that meet existing federal standards. The products are all  regulated by the federal Food and Drug Administration.  </P> <P> But California environmentalists contend that loopholes in the federal  regulatory system allow consumers to be exposed to hazardous chemicals,  particularly pesticide residues, in some of the products.  </P> <P> In some cases, environmentalists argue, federal standards are more lax than  Proposition 65, which requires that there be "no significant risk." They point  out that the FDA does not test food for the presence of some chemicals  identified by the state as causing cancer or reproductive harm.  </P> <P> "The FDA regulations have loopholes that Proposition 65 is designed to close,"  said David Roe, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund and a co-author  of Proposition 65. "If the judge rules the way he is leaning, it will close  those loopholes."  </P> <P> The Grocery Manufacturers of America have argued that the nation's food supply  is safe and that the FDA has done a good job of regulating the industry.  </P> <P> Jeff Nedelman, a spokesman for the food manufacturers, said the industry is  fighting to keep the exemption because it believes that food should be  regulated solely by the federal government without interference from individual  states.  </P> <P> "We're trying to protect the confidence of the American people in the food  supply," he said.  </P> <P> State officials have long insisted that their regulation is not a blanket  exemption for foods, drugs, cosmetics and medical devices because Proposition  65 will still apply to those products that do not meet federal standards.  </P> <P> But Robie quickly dismissed the contention, saying from the bench, "You have to  call it an exemption because that's what it is."  </P> <P> A decision to strike down the regulation would be a major victory for the  AFL-CIO, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Natural Resources Defense Council  and other environmental groups that brought the lawsuit.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, the same labor and environmental coalition won a decision  from Robie ordering the state to consider whether as many as 200 chemicals  should be added to the list of 279 substances so far identified by the state as  causing cancer or reproductive harm.  </P></p>

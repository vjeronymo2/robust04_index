			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The Voz Andes" newscast] </F>   [Excerpt] Hundreds of students protested today against the  government after fuel prices were increased by up to 71 percent.  Despite rain and low temperatures in Quito, university and high  school students had serious confrontations with the police,  whose numbers have been insufficient to contain the  demonstrators.    Vice President Alberto Dahik became a target of the protests  in spite of the public force deployment downtown and throughout  the city. A group of students threw rocks at the vice  president's vehicle and broke the windows as he approached his  offices near the presidential palace. Witnesses said Vice  President Dahik emerged unscathed from the shower of rocks. The  police reported that the demonstrators then tried to reach the  presidential palace but were turned back by tear gas.    The Army began increasing security at the Ecuadoran  presidential palace on Friday in the face of a wave of protests  against the increase in fuel prices. More than 28 protest  centers have been pinpointed in the capital. Students in  Guayaquil held demonstrations during which transportation  vehicles were hijacked and tires burned.    The government has announced the suspension of classes on 2,  3, and 4 February throughout the nation in light of the general  protest situation. Education Minister Rosalia Arteaga said: We  ask the people to remain calm because violent attitudes do not  solve the nation's internal problems. On the contrary, the  problems get worse as they create a climate of uncertainty.  Politicians responded that the Ecuadoran people have at the  very least the right to protest.    Student federations and centers as well as teachers  associations called for a strike on Wednesday. The workers  called for a 24-hour preventive national strike on Thursday to  protest the new prices and to exert pressure on the government  to rectify the measures. [passage omitted]</p>

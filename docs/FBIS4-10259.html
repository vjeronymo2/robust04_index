			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Tania Monteiro] </F>   [Excerpt] Brasilia -- President Itamar Franco is trying to  separate the economic plan from the presidential candidacy of  former Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso (PSDB) [Brazilian  Social Democracy Party]. He fears that the stabilization  program, chosen by the PSDB as its main campaign banner, will be  rejected in Congress for electoral reasons. His main concern is  the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], which believes  the PSDB candidate will be the main beneficiary if inflation is  curbed.    "We need maturity; the stabilization plan is not simply a  convenient electoral banner, but a national commitment that must  be complied with, even by future governments, for the benefit of  the country," Franco said. On 6 April Franco discussed the  subject during a meeting with Cardoso, Civilian Household  Minister Henrique Hargreaves, and Deputy Luiz Carlos Santos  (PMDB-SP) [Sao Paulo], the government leader in the lower house.  Franco still intends to talk with the government leader in the  Senate, Pedro Simon (PMDB-RS) [Rio Grande do Sul] and with other  party leaders. Franco will probably even summon a cabinet  meeting to explain that the economic plan must not be confused  with the PSDB candidacy. [passage omitted]</p>

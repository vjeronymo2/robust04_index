			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Johor Baharu, 18 May -- Illegal fishing  activities in Malaysian waters by Vietnamese fishermen who are  former military personnel well trained in warfare are posing a  new threat to the country. This follows the discovery of a  rocket-launcher and several automatic rifles in two Vietnamese  fishing trawlers detained in Terengganu recently.    Abdul Hamid Syukor, chairman of the Marine Division of the  Fishery Department said that from the national security  viewpoint, the discovery of the weapons is serious and at the  same time a danger to the country's maritime officials. "Even  though there were no clashes when the weapons were seized, the  seizure was something serious because these Vietnamese were well  trained in using war weapons," he said to reporters after  visiting the marine fishery center here. Therefore, maritime  officers have been instructed to conduct thorough examinations  on Vietnamese trawlers involved in illegal fishing in the area.    Abdul Hamid said the trawlers were found during the  incidents  on 4 and 7 March to be armed with one rocket-launcher, one light  machine gun, two M-16 rifles, and two AK-47 rifles, as well as  eight ammunition magazines, 13 rounds of 40mm ammunition, and  485 rounds of ammunition. He added the two trawlers had been  detained by two Royal Malaysian Navy patrol boats at 150  nautical miles in Pahang waters early in the morning. [passage  omitted]</p>

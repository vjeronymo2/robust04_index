			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Arts: Maxwell Davies &amp; Muldowney - New Music Peter Maxwell Davies took charge of the Royal Philharmonic on Monday in his new role as the orchestra's associate conductor/composer, a position he already holds with both the Scottish Chamber Orchestra and the BBC Philharmonic. He has promised his Sixth Symphony to the RPO for performance in 1996, their 50th anniversary. In the meantime he will conduct the orchestra in concerts and recordings, though his forays into the mainstream orchestral repertory remain unconvincing. The programme combined Davies's own music with Sibelius - the tone poem Tapiola and the Violin Concerto, with Tasmin Little as the excellent soloist. Sibelius has been a potent influence on Davies's own music for the best part of two decades, from the First Symphony onwards, and it was fascinating to hear how, in Tapiola especially, he dealt with those elements that bear directly on his own later style - the continuous skeins of development, the saw-tooth waves of tension, the machine-like consistency of the momentum - without ever quite welding them into a unity. Davies ended the concert with An Orkney Wedding, with Sunrise, arguably nowadays his most popular work, and conducted the first performance of a second suite drawn from his evening-long score Caroline Mathilde, written for the Danish Royal Ballet last year. The first suite of four movements (already available on disc) drew upon the first act of the ballet; the new one, lasting half an hour, contains seven numbers from Act 2 which chart the inevitable drift towards disaster of the heroine, wife of King Christian VII of Denmark, the execution of her lover, Struensee, and Caroline's own exile. The music is skilful, effortlessly sustained; Davies's mingling of parody and pastiche with his own style is now utterly instinctive. But it is also far less pungent and memorable than it was: the music makes more accommodations with its audience, softens its edges, undercuts its irony. Even the final section of Caroline Mathilde, accompanying the queen's farewell to her child and her departure, is soft-centred, not at all bleak. The passacaglia that provides the second pas de deux for Caroline and Struensee, built from arching string lines, is the core of the suite and its strongest music, but even that power is diffused in the sections that follow it. * * * At the Barbican the London Symphony Orchestra's new season has already included two significant premieres. The orchestra's first concert with Michael Tilson Thomas contained Colin Matthews's Hidden Variables, an orchestral expansion of an existing ensemble piece which pokes gentle and sometimes not so gentle fun at the 57 varieties of minimalism, while last Wednesday brought the first performance of Dominic Muldowney's Oboe Concerto, commissioned by the LSO for its principal oboist Roy Carter. This is the third concerto by Muldowney to appear in less than a year, but it is far less intricate in construction than either the work for percussion or that for violin. Muldowney calls it a 'Song-cycle for oboe and orchestra', and the impression is of an intensely lyrical work, a succession of deliciously suggestive inventions separated by brief recitatives. The solo writing keeps the oboe in its highest register for much of the time, while the accompanying textures are generally thin and crystalline; the technical demands, wonderfully mastered by Carter, are formidable. The songs contain passing references to jazz and popular-song styles, dips into Debussyan impressionism and overripe Straussian romanticism (though the near-quote of the Redemption motive from The Ring is surely accidental). The single lack, perhaps inappropriate in an oboe concerto in any case, is of any real muscularity, as if in stripping out all his complex apparatus of rhythm and tempo Muldowney has jettisoned some of his more bracing aspects too. A small cavil, though; the piece is a major addition to the oboist's repertory. RPO: Royal Festival Hall. LSO: Barbican Hall; Muldowney commission assisted by Sema Group plc.</p>

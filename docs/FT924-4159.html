			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: Santiago weighed down by overheated economy - Traders fear another rate rise Santiago's stock exchange is suffering from a bout of year-end blues, due to fears of another rise in interest rates to cool down the country's overheated economy. The latest projections show the Chilean economy growing by over 9 per cent in 1992. Inflation has also quickened in November and may overshoot the government's target of 13 per cent for the year. So in spite of rises in interest rates in August and October, traders believe the central bank will try to dampen Chile's frenzied economic activity with a further adjustment in base rates before the end of the year. High yields on government paper have siphoned off funds from the bolsa. The Ipsa index of the 40 most traded shares fell by 7 per cent in November, continuing a downward trend that began in August. Compared to previous years, the performance of share prices has been modest this year. The Ipsa has risen by 17.7 per cent in nominal peso terms since January, or by 10.4 per cent in dollar terms, according to the International Finance Corporation. By contrast, Ipsa shares more than doubled their value last year. 'We do not see much year-end enthusiasm in the stock market given low third-quarter corporate earnings and high risk-free government yields,' say investment analysts at Celfin, the managers of Solomon Brothers' Chile Fund. Other factors are also undermining confidence. The government has announced a major reform of the capital markets in Chile, but details of the new regulations are being kept under wraps. They are expected to affect the equity portfolios of private pension funds - the biggest players in the stock market - and the ensuing uncertainty is holding back investors. Daily turnover has dropped to Dollars 6.5m from an average Dollars 11m in the past year. In addition, Chile's electricity companies, the most actively traded stocks, have taken a pounding following a very public row over electricity tariffs. These come under review every four years, and the government has ordered tariff cuts for the 1993-97 period. By protesting too loudly electricity companies appear to have triggered a run on their shares. Enersis, the holding group which owns Chilectra, the biggest power distribution company in Chile, saw its shares plunge by 9 per cent in November, for a 24 per cent drop since their peak in June. Not even the company's healthy third-quarter earnings, up 34 per cent compared with the first nine months of 1991, have been able to revive interest in the shares. The offloading of utility shares has also affected Endesa, the biggest power generator in Chile, even though the tariff cuts apply only to the electricity distribution companies. Endesa shares, which account for 30 per cent of daily trading volume, were down 6.3 per cent last month. They have lost 26.8 per cent of their value since June, even though profits were up by 22 per cent in the first nine months of the year. Traders, however, are expecting a rally as Endesa was recently awarded an 'investment grade' rating by Standard &amp; Poor's, making it the only private-sector company in Latin America to attain international standards of creditworthiness. One foreign investment fund manager believes that the market has overreacted to what is essentially good news. While investment and exports continue to grow at almost twice the rate of the economy, he thinks that fears of overheating are unwarranted. Most traders believe the market will bounce back early next year, once the new legislation affecting Chile's capital markets is in place. They expect the Ipsa index to rise by 10 per cent in real terms between now and March, given the underlying strength of the economy and the growth potential of Chile's leading companies.</p>

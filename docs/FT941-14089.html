			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: Pennzoil faces Dollars 957m tax demand Pennzoil, the US oil company, has been presented with a tax demand for Dollars 957m from the Internal Revenue Service over a settlement it received six years ago after a long-running dispute with Texaco. The IRS has ruled that Pennzoil should pay tax on the Dollars 2.2bn of the Dollars 3bn settlement which it invested in shares in another oil company, Chevron. Pennzoil, which has paid tax on the remaining Dollars 800m, has always argued that the larger part of the settlement should not be taxed. It said it had received a ruling from the IRS that its 1988 income should be increased by Dollars 2.2bn. This created a tax deficiency for the year of Dollars 551m, plus additional after-tax interest of Dollars 234m. Pennzoil said the IRS had disallowed Dollars 366m of litigation and other costs related to the dispute with Texaco, and that this would produce a tax deficiency of Dollars 125m, plus interest of Dollars 47m. The company said it continued to dispute the issue, and would appeal. It said it had the financial resources necessary to deal with any ruling that followed. Late last year, Pennzoil sold Dollars 721m of Chevron stock, prompting speculation that it was building cash reserves in case the IRS ruling went against it. The Dollars 3bn settlement followed a dispute over Texaco's acquisition of Getty Oil in the 1980s.</p>

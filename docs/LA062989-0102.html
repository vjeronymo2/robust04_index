			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT SAYS U.S. HAS FINAL POWER OVER GUARDSMEN  </P> <P> The federal government, not state governors, has the final authority over the  deployment of National Guard troops outside the United States, an appeals court  ruled Wednesday.  </P> <P> The U.S. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld an amendment that prohibits  governors from withholding consent to send troops outside the country because  of objections to the location, purpose, type or schedule of active duty.  </P> <P> "We hold that the Constitution does not require gubernatorial consent to active  duty for training of the National Guard of the United States," the court said  in its 7-2 opinion.  </P> <P> The original lawsuit was filed on behalf of Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich by  Hubert H. Humphrey III, the state's attorney general. Minnesota was joined in  the suit by the states of Colorado, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, Ohio and  Vermont.  </P> <P> Opposing them was the Defense Department, which was joined as friends of the  court by the National Guard Assn. of the United States and the states of  Alabama, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi and  Missouri.  </P> <P> In 1985 and 1986, several governors objected to deployment of National Guard  personnel to Central America. The governors withheld or threatened to withhold  their consent to federally ordered active duty missions by their states'  National Guard units.  </P> <P> In response, Congress enacted the Montgomery Amendment, which prohibits the  governors from withholding consent.  </P></p>

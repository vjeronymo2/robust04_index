			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHAMIR GETS RIGHT-WING GOVERNMENT;  </P> <P> ISRAEL: THE CABINET WILL BE DOMINATED BY OPPONENTS OF PEACE TALKS WITH THE  PALESTINIANS.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir formed the most right-wing government in Israeli  history today and said its top priority would be Jewish immigration from the  Soviet Union.  </P> <P> After protracted last-minute wrangling, seven extreme right-wing and religious  parties and three independent parliamentarians signed a coalition agreement.  </P> <P> It came 12 weeks after the dovish Labor Party brought down a national unity  government over Shamir's refusal to accept U.S. proposals for  Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.  </P> <P> The new government, backed by 62 members of the 120-seat Parliament, will seek  a vote of confidence Monday.  </P> <P> An exhausted-looking Shamir, 74, toasted his new coalition as "a national  government that will conduct affairs of state during a tough period with many  dangers."  </P> <P> "The government's main effort will be on the most important matter in our lives  today -- the mass immigration flowing into the country and the absorption" of  immigrants, he declared.  </P> <P> Israel expects up to 250,000 Soviet Jews to arrive this year and Jewish agency  officials disclosed this week that about 1.1 million Soviet Jews had received  immigration visas.  </P> <P> The Cabinet will be dominated by opponents of peace talks with the Palestinians  and advocates of increased Jewish settlement in the occupied territories.  </P> <P> Political commentators said it could set Israel on a collision course with the  United States, its guardian ally.  </P> <P> "Barring a miracle, Shamir will find himself in direct conflict with the United  States, the Soviet Union, Europe, the Palestinians and the Arab world,"  diplomatic commentator Akiva Eldar wrote in the Haaretz newspaper.  </P> <P> The coalition's policy guidelines said the new government would work to  "strengthen, expand and develop" Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank  and Gaza Strip, the biggest source of friction between Israel and Washington.  </P> <P> "Settlement in all parts of the land of Israel is the right of the Jewish  people and an inseparable part of national security," the document said.  </P></p>

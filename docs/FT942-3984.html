			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Private View: The real woman who plays a man's game - Giselle Prangnell might have been a ballet dancer. But rugby hooked her and now she lines up for England Her name is Giselle and she plays rugby for England. Not, to be sure, for the side that hammered South Africa last Saturday but for the distaff side that beat the US to win the women's world rugby championship last month. At 5ft 6in and a little over 9 stone, Giselle Prangnell might easily have become the ballet dancer her mother once dreamt of. Instead, she is playing the scarcely less demanding role of fly-half for the women's team at London club Wasps, and inside centre for England: her running, thinking, kicking and tackling have earned her 14 caps and two tries. OK. So there are girls who play football and girls who row. There are even some who box to keep in shape. But rugby? That's a real man's game. No longer. There are more than 300 women's clubs in Britain, some able to field several teams, and the number continues to grow. Giselle, 28, took up the game eight years ago at the suggestion of a boyfriend because she was bored with netball and hockey. She was at Exeter University and commuted to London every Sunday to play for the quaintly-named Antlers Club. 'I'd got six phone calls from six different women I'd never heard of before,' she said. 'So I said, 'All right, I'll be there, I'll be there.' I went down the following Tuesday and I've never enjoyed myself so much.' Didn't you find it a bit physical? 'Um. Initially, I think so. Sometimes when I watch men's rugby, or even ours, and see the contact that goes on, it looks like madness.' She laughed, happily. 'But when you're actually involved in the game, when you're hit, you're not thinking that. You're thinking about what you've got to do with the ball next, where you've got to be next. There are very few occasions where I've felt the contact was a problem - and I'm quite quite small in comparison to some.' Yes, I said, ungallantly, I think I might get past you. 'It's not about size and weight,' she rebuked me. To illustrate, she described making the 'fatal mistake' of once watching opponents, the French national team, in training. Her opposite number was huge, and a crash tackler. 'But on the first contact we had I just went really low, took her down, and that was it. If anything, she had more trouble with me and Jackie (the outside centre) than we had with her. It's all in the mind.' What does rugby do for a girl that hockey doesn't? 'I find it the most complete sport I've ever come across. Because you have to be there physically, you've got to be really fit - at the top level, we're all athletes in one form or another - and you've got to be mentally tuned. And you've got to have a really good knowledge of the game. It's very tactical.' I suppose you can drink 20 pints in a session as well? 'Oh my God, no]' she giggled. 'No, I couldn't, not by a long chalk.' I imagine that some men come to your games hoping to see women wrestling in mud. 'Some may come with that attitude, but they don't leave with it.' The women's game has had favourable reviews from the commentators. It is different, however: there is less kicking (good kickers are rare), more running, and many more tries. But Giselle disagrees with those who have compared the national team to a good schoolboy side. Technically, she said, the women probably were better; they learned later in life and had developed fewer bad habits. Women have more fat on their bodies than men and cannot develop the same muscle tone, however hard they train. Some, like Giselle, may bruise easily. But there were few broken bones. One team-mate, a fierce tackler, had broken her collarbone - but not on the field: she was flattened in the street by a fleeing shoplifter. 'If people say you can't play rugby because it's physical contact, our simple answer is: why not?' Because you could damage yourselves, I said. 'All our reproductive organs, everything, is internal. It's all protected. But, for a man, it's out there for all and sundry to kick and stamp over. So, from the physiological point of view, a female's body is better protected.' Nor, she said, were breasts particularly vulnerable. 'Men have this idea that it's a massive problem for us. And it's just not.' We associate girls with gentleness, consideration, deference. Are they like that on the field? 'No,' she said, briskly. Alternatively, we are told that when a woman is ruthless, she is more ruthless than a man. Giselle seemed to like the sound of that. 'We're very committed when we're out there. We're there to win it. It's not like: 'All right, you got there first, you have the ball.' We mean business as much as anybody else.' Is there bad behaviour in the rucks? 'It's creeping in. But it's different to the men's game. You'll see very few incidents. For instance, a lot will step over you if you pop out the wrong side of the scrum. It depends how important the game is.' But, I protested, isn't there something very unladylike about it all? 'Um. Yeah. I mean, I hardly think we look particularly feminine when we're all covered in mud from head to foot. In some games, I'm sure you couldn't tell when we leave the field whether we were a bunch of girls or guys.' Even on the field, it is sometimes hard to tell from the beefy legs of the scrummaging forwards - and some of these women weigh 13 stone - the cropped hair-styles and quick running of the backs. Was it part of the fun to defy the girly stereotype? 'No,' she said, firmly. 'There are misconceptions. I don't play sport to be feminine or masculine. I play sport because it's an emotional release. I always feel tremendous after I've exercised. It's a feeling of physical well-being. I play rugby because I really enjoy it. I've always been sporty. I come back into the rest of my life a more relaxed, a calmer, person.' It is no secret that some women rugby players are lesbians. Giselle, who is not, says sexual preferences have no more relevance in rugby than in tennis, golf, athletics or any other sport. 'In men's rugby you've got giants, squat ones, pretty boys in the backs,' she said. 'If someone looks butch or hasn't got a pretty face, they get stereotyped. 'I couldn't care less what people do behind closed doors. My sport has nothing to do with my sex life, with my relationships, with anything. It's a completely separate part of my life, as is my work (she is a a physical education teacher at Sheen Comprehensive in south-west London). What other people do with their lives is their business.' She agreed that women's rugby was a 'massive challenge' to men's ideas about what women could or couldn't, should or shouldn't, do. Yet many little girls  -'the tiniest, most feminine and pretty' - were keen to take it up. 'You don't have to be a certain type of woman to play. I still enjoy cooking supper. I love being with kids. I want kids and all the rest of it, and plan to do that. I never wear make-up to play my sport. I run out, play my sport, am totally committed when I'm on the field. I then go in, have my shower, put my make-up on, dry my hair. And I'm out and ready to be back into what society expects of a female.' If women's rugby got more of an airing on television, she said, finally, the players would be seen for what they were: normal human beings, not freaks. Nor was there any reason why women's rugby should not become an established sport. 'To be honest, such limitations as there are - like we can't kick so far - is what's now making it more attractive than men's. If ever we overcome all that, maybe then we would just become a slower version of the men's game. But, no, I can't see anything that would stop it, apart from people's attitudes.' So you expect to see a women's international played at Twickenham (the headquarters of English rugby) one day? 'It's one of my ambitions. I'd love to.' Giselle sprang from the sofa to show me the video of herself and her team-mates in action in their world cup final. 'You should come and see a game yourself one day,' she said. I will, I replied. And I shall. Life of Riley, Page XVI</p>

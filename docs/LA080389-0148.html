			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: VOLUNTEERISM TAKES A MUSICAL TURN IN ORANGE COUNTY  </P> <P> Instead of a thousand points of light, an Irvine social work student named  James Lovell has decided to transform volunteerism into a few thousand watts of  sound.  </P> <P> Lovell, 20, has merged his interest in the local rock music scene with his  desire to do charitable work by launching Spare Change, a new organization  devoted to putting on benefit shows that will showcase Orange County rock music  talent. Lovell, a senior at Christ College, a Lutheran school in Irvine, will  inaugurate his project Saturday night with a five-band charity bill at the  Saddleback Valley Board of Realtors Hall in Laguna Hills.  </P> <P> "This is my volunteer work," he said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The varied lineup includes funk band Jerrasound, hard rockers the End and  Shuttup, Purple Shake, a psychedelic group, and the Slugs, who play new wave  rock. The show starts at 7 p.m. at the Realtors Hall, 25552 La Paz Ave.  Proceeds will go to the Interfaith Christian Assistance Network, which sponsors  drug education programs, and LIFE (Love Is Feeding Everyone), a Los Angeles  group that helps feed the homeless.  </P> <P> "I've been going to shows since I was 13, all different styles," Lovell said  Wednesday. "I think it's great to see new talent. It's the new talent that does  something different."  </P> <P> Lovell's goals for Spare Change are to highlight the work of local bands (which  will all be donating their services), to raise money for good causes, and to  prod the conscience of young rock fans.  </P> <P> "Laguna Hills, where this show is taking place, is an affluent area," Lovell  said. "I want the kids who listen to that kind of music to realize there are  people who go with a lot less and need some help."  </P> <P> Lovell said he is using his own money to cover the show's overhead costs: $900  for renting the 299-capacity hall and taking out insurance. Tickets to the  benefit, which Lovell has dubbed "Regaining Consciousness," cost $10, with a $2  discount to concert-goers who bring two canned food items. Information: (714)  854-6764.  </P> <P> FIRST SOLO: Chameleon Records has scheduled a September release for "Ward One:  Along the Way," the first solo album by former Black Sabbath drummer Bill Ward,  who lives in Seal Beach. It's a concept album, in which Ward combines heavy  metal with progressive rock touches as he chronicles the life-or-death struggle  with alcoholism that followed his ascent to rock stardom.  </P> <P> Ward's old Black Sabbath buddy, Ozzy Osbourne, appears as guest lead singer on  two tracks, "Bombers" and "Jack's Land" -- with "Bombers" a fine, rumbling,  dark-hued rocker that Ozzy's fans shouldn't miss (Osbourne headlines tonight at  Irvine Meadows). Cream's singer, Jack Bruce, also makes a guest appearance on  the album.  </P> <P> In a recent Billboard magazine tribute to Osbourne, Ward recalled his friend's  reaction upon first hearing "Pink Clouds an Island," a Pink Floyd-ish track  from Ward's album: Osbourne physically and verbally attacked Ward, "all of  which is his way of saying he liked what he heard."  </P> <P> WASTELAND: Music Connection magazine decided to survey the Orange County music  scene in its July 24 -- Aug. 6 issue. Apparently, according to record label  talent scouts queried by the magazine, there's no there there (or, from our  viewpoint, no here here) when it comes to music-making.  </P> <P> "Where's Orange County?" wonders Bret Hartman, A&amp;R representative for MCA  Records. Says Mio Vukovic, of Geffen Records: "A few of our bands play down  there, such as Little Caesar and Junkyard, but now it's almost like a wasteland  down there. And there really isn't much young talent in Orange County."  </P> <P> Such comments are par for the course from creatures of a corporate,  multinational music industry that's geared more to watching the bottom line  than to following its ears.  </P> <P> The fact is that it's better, at least from a creative standpoint, for local  bands to be ignored by big-label A&amp;R folk who want to mold everything they  touch into the next Guns N' Roses. The better Orange County bands -- and there  are many of them -- are finding their own ways to play, rather than gearing  their output to the tastes of big-label scouts trained to think like bankers  rather than as seekers of passionate, adventurous music.  </P> <P> Maybe Junkyard, the sort of workaday clone-of-Aerosmith hard-rock band that the  L.A. scene churns out like so much ear fodder, is Mr. Vukovic's idea of  promising young talent.  </P> <P> I'll stick with the creative locals you've been reading about regularly in this  space, even if they aren't something the big labels can sell by the bushel.  </P> <P> DIVERSIFICATION: Dr. Dream, the Orange-based record company that is home to a  good many of those creative locals, is throwing a bash this weekend to  celebrate its diversification into the record shop business.  </P> <P> The store, like Dr. Dream's roster of bands, is geared to alternative music  tastes. Grand opening festivities will take place Saturday and Sunday from 1  p.m. to 5 p.m., with in-shop acoustic performances by the Swamp Zombies,  Eggplant and Imagining Yellow Suns, as well as free food and drink, prizes, and  storewide merchandise discounts.  </P> <P> Dr. Dream Records (the store) is located at 60 Plaza Square in Orange, below  its parent label's offices.  </P> <P> ENDINGS: The Movement, a San Clemente-based pop-rock band that got some  exposure last year with a self-released album and soundtrack work for surfing  shows, has called it quits over musical disagreements within the group.  </P> <P> "I wanted to play hard-edged, more guitar-oriented, stronger music," said Steve  Clifton, the Movement's singer. "Some other people in the band wanted to go a  little more sophisticated, and others wanted to go acoustic."  </P> <P> Clifton said he is forming a new band called Joyriders with three transplanted  Londoners -- not to be confused with Joyride, another new group being launched  by former Adolescents Steve Soto and Sandy Hansen.  </P></p>

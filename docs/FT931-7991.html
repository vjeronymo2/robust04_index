			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / ANC sanctions plea until poll date set THE African National Congress yesterday relaxed its policy on economic sanctions against South Africa, but said sanctions should remain until a date is set for multi-racial elections. This cannot be done until multi-party negotiations yield agreement on a range of difficult issues, including basic principles for a new constitution, the re-incorporation of nominally independent black homelands and multi-party control of the security forces. Agreement on an election date is likely to take several months, although swift progress in multi-party talks, due to begin next month, could bring agreement sooner. The ANC yesterday imposed several linked conditions for the lifting of sanctions, apart from an election date: a multi-party council must be established to oversee the government, with subsidiary councils to supervise elections and the state-run broadcasting corporation, and the existing constitution must be amended. Once these steps are taken, the ANC would call for trade, investment, financial and diplomatic sanctions to be lifted, but the international arms and oil embargoes would remain in place. Such a move would boost the business mood in South Africa, but would have little effect on private investment, with domestic and foreign investors more concerned about prospects for political stability and economic discipline under a multi-racial government. A resumption of lending by multilateral financial institutions such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund would be the biggest benefit from an end to sanctions. The IMF might make funds available immediately through its compensating financing facility, designed to reimburse member countries for an unexpected shortfall in export receipts or for a rise in imports. However, South Africa could not seek balance of payments support until its current account was in deficit. It was around R4.5bn (Pounds 1bn) in surplus last year. Since the mid-1980s, South Africa has been forced to run a substantial current account surplus to cover foreign debt repayments, since international banks halted new lending to the republic. Capital outflows since 1985 have totalled over R40bn. ANC officials hope that lifting sanctions would prompt a surge of foreign investment and boost its chances of victory in the first multi-racial elections. At the weekend, ANC leader Nelson Mandela appealed for R130m for the organisation's election campaign. Meanwhile, Mr FW de Klerk, the President, tried to tackle his government's racist image in advance of elections, by appointing two coloureds (mixed race) and one Indian to his cabinet in minor positions. However he also appointed a noted hardliner, Mr Kobie Coetzee, to the sensitive position of Minister of Defence.</p>

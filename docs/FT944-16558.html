			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Foreign operators calling Beijing's number  -It is 'the end of a very long road and the first step on a long march' Lord Young, chairman of Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK and its principal operating subsidiary Hongkong Telecom, yesterday resembled a cat with a bowl of cream. As he parried questions about Hongkong Telecom's latest deals in China, Lord Young knew - but could not say - that he was announcing the end to China's post-war policy of prohibiting foreign participation in the operation of domestic telecoms services. The implications are wide-ranging, although analysts were careful to stress the preliminary nature of yesterday's announcement. The Chinese government aims to increase its number of phone lines from about 30m - barely more than the UK - to at least 110m by 2000. That is equivalent to the construction of a telecoms network far larger than Japan's in barely six years. Equipment suppliers familiar with China's ministry of posts and telecommunications (MPT) have long believed it would not be possible to meet that objective without investment and management input from western network operators. Yesterday's announcement appears to signal Beijing's recognition of the fact, opening the world's largest telecoms growth market to overseas operators. The regime for participation is likely to remain unclear for some time. C&amp;W has still to negotiate the precise terms of its engagement in the two networks operations unveiled yesterday, and negotiations with other operators are still at an early stage. But many operators besides C&amp;W have ambitions to enter China, and some already have a foot in the door. Nynex, one of the seven US Baby Bell regional operators, is acting as an adviser to LianTong Communications, a recently-launched state telecoms company operating alongside the established MPT. AT&amp;T, the largest US operator, is also exploring prospects. In all, Hongkong Telecom expects to invest between Dollars 250m and Dollars 350m over the next two to three years, and that could just be the beginning. For the past 15 years China's domestic telecoms market has been the Holy Grail for Hongkong Telecom. 'We have been talking to China for years about projects,' Lord Young said. 'The first project - which will take three-quarters of planned expenditure - is a joint venture with Beijing's Telecommunications Authority to upgrade, develop and share the management of the Chinese capital's cellular telephone network. Currently the network supports 60,000 users and 300,000 pagers. In addition to upgrading from analogue to digital technology, Hongkong Telecom plans to double its size of the network every year 'for the next few years'. The second is participation in the construction and management of a fibre-optic cable between Beijing and Hong Kong. It will undertake this venture with the ministry of posts and telecommunications. The cable will stretch some 3,000km - passing 80 towns and cities along the way - and connect to the Guangzhou-Hong Kong fibre optic link. Capacity will be increased by 80,000 lines. As with the Beijing cellular telephone deal, Hongkong Telecom expects to participate in the management of the facility and earn equity-type returns. C&amp;W said it was important for Hongkong Telecom to do its first major deals with Beijing entities, signalling the Chinese government's blessing for the ventures. Hongkong Telecom has spent years cultivating relationships in Guangdong, Fujian and Shanghai. After its network in Hong Kong went digital last year it completed shipping - and installing gratis - all its analogue telephone switches to Guangdong. 'It helped promote telephone traffic between Guangdong and Hong Kong; it was enlightened self-interest,' he said. In Shanghai, where Cable &amp; Wireless on Monday held its first board meeting on the Chinese mainland, the local authorities welcomed their participation in the city's telecommunications market. The local government is especially keen for the company to expand telecoms in the Pudong special economic zone. The Chinese move takes place against a backdrop of rapid liberalisation and privatisation in the international telecoms industry. Demand for capital and telecoms development expertise is intensifying across the developed world - particularly in Asia - as governments seek to modernise their telecoms networks as a key element in policies to promote economic growth. 'You could say it is the end of a very long road and the first step on a long march,' said Lord Young. But as the Chinese say: the longest march starts with a single step.</p>

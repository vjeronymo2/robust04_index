			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Arts: 'Canterbury Tales' on the vicarage lawn - Martin Hoyle finds more postcard humour than Chaucer in this revival Across the road from the Garrick Theatre on Thursday evening a group of Morris Men, biologically if not politically corrected to Morris Women, jingled their stuff. Inside the theatre ominous signs directed us 'to the vicarage lawn'. In the auditorium we were assailed with the determined jollity of actors acting normal people, uttering lines like 'I'm the local vicar here' and 'It's lovely weather, just what we needed' as they mingled in the stalls with the insouciant spontaneity of Desert Storm. At the appearance of the ultimate deterrent, notebooks and pens in the hands of some of my colleagues, their cordiality became less marked and they turned their frozen smiles elsewhere. The mood of village theatricals is deliberate. The latest resurrection of Michael Bogdanov's 1978 Young Vic adaptation of The Canterbury Tales is set during the annual Geoffrey Chaucer Storytelling Competition supervised by the vicar of Upper Hopewell. This framework cunningly licences the muse of writer Robin Davies to roam through such well-loved comic exchanges as 'Can I have the actors on the lawn, please?' Excited female voice: 'You can have me, vicar]' and 'I'm the Reverend Nicholas Nunn.' Brian Glover, heckling from the audience: 'Knickerless nun? Oo]' There are time-honoured references to 'spanking tarts' and competitors 'getting the biggest clap'. If the thrust and parry of 'You're the fakir]' 'I beg your pardon]' and the spirit of Donald Magill postcards are your sort of thing, you will find this a painless introduction to the first great English poet. Ah yes, Geoffrey Chaucer. The amateur thesps of Upper Hopewell mount (ho ho) five of his tales, while the audience is coerced, panto-style, into demanding a sixth, the Miller's Tale, needless to say, from the previously proscribed Brian Glover. Your final receptiveness to Peter James' production depends on how you take Mr Glover, voice of a thousand TV commercials (even the theatre posters refer to 'Chaucer with nowt taken out'), God in the National's Mysteries and remorselessly jovial professional Yorkshireman. Here he turns up as everything from a fakir to a busty barmaid in costumes that ingeniously incorporate an elephant and the bar respectively. What is more, much more, is that he fills in with what used to be called saloon bar stories, a few of which go a long way, some decidedly too far. When not cringeing, or blossoming, before this campaign of ferocious comic attrition, you can find much to admire in a cast that gives signs of being rather classier than its material. Richard Cant, an accomplished young comic, and the pretty Katherine Oliver deserve mention for gallantry that includes exposing bare bottoms in the Miller's Tale. Nicolas Lumley's vicar puts over hoary old facetiousness as if it were fresh; but then the whole company deserves a clearer brief. Is this a family show? It strikes me as too unremittingly, leeringly smutty. Is it an adults only show? It is too clumpingly unsophisticated. I have an awful idea that it may be fitted into a sixteen-pints-and-a-vindaloo evening by office parties or those still suffering withdrawal symptoms over the World Cup. I would hesitate to recommend it to Eng. Lit. students.</p>

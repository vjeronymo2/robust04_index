			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Warning over tax file access SENSITIVE company tax information could fall into the 'wrong hands' under government market-testing plans for parts of the Inland Revenue, Mr Clive Brooke, general secretary of the Inland Revenue Staff Federation, warned yesterday. In a letter to 50 companies, he said Revenue files had never been penetrated by industrial or commercial spies or by computer hackers. Confidential tax information was known only to officers, who had never sold nor exchanged any details. 'This may not be the case in future because the government is set on privatising key parts of the Revenue,' said Mr Brooke. The Revenue's computer division is about to be contracted out, and typing and secretarial services are to be market tested with the possibility of work going to private contractors.</p>

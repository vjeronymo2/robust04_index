			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RIVER TRIP  </P> <P> Short walk through fields to soft-drink stand where boats wait -- all aboard!  Creak of rope oarlock. One man pulls the single oar, another poles, a third  steers, a fourth stands by to relieve the first. High-up shrine, bamboo glade.  Woodland a cherry tree still in bloom punctuates like gunsmoke. Egret flying  upstream, neck cocked. Entering the (very gentle) rapids everyone gasps with  pleasure. The little waves break backwards, nostalgia con moto, a drop of fresh  water thrills the cheek. And then? Woodland, bamboo glade, high-up shrine.  Years of this have tanned and shriveled the boatmen. For after all, the truly  exhilarating bits  </P> <P> were few, far between  </P> <P>  -- boulders goaded past, dumb beasts  </P> <P> mantled in glass-green  </P> <P> gush -- and patently  </P> <P> led where but to the landing,  </P> <P> the bridge, the crowds. We  </P> <P> step ashore, in our clumsiness hoping not to spoil these brief impressions.  </P> <P> From "Prose of Departure," Part IV of "The Inner Room" (Alfred A. Knopf: $16.95  cloth; $8.95 paper; 95 pp.). Of this section of the five-part book (including a  verse-drama), Stephen Yenser writes, in a note for the publisher: "Set mostly  in Japan, it intertwines narratives of beginnings and endings even as it  intersperses its prose with hokku in a manner reminiscent of Basho's travel  journals -- though the delicately managed rhymes set Merrill's cachet upon the  form." James Merrill, 1988. Reprinted by permission of Alfred A. Knopf. Merrill  is one of the most celebrated poets in America, having won the National Book  Award twice, the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Critics Circle award and,  for "The Changing Light at Sandover," the Los Angeles Times Book Prize.  </P></p>

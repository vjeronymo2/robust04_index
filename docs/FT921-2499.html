			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Bristol &amp; West up 11% despite bad debt charge BRISTOL &amp; WEST, the 10th largest building society, last year increased pre-tax profits by 11 per cent despite the depression in the housing market. The outcome amounted to Pounds 67.4m, up from Pounds 60.6m in 1990, though the society had to make a bad debt charge of Pounds 24.5m, up from Pounds 5.4m. Total group assets rose from Pounds 5.64bn to Pounds 7.14bn. During the year the society took over the Cheshunt, only to discover that its reserves were wiped out by its bad debt, leaving a shortfall of Pounds 5m. The merger contributed Pounds 392m to total assets, despite the high proportion of bad debt. The society also incurred a Pounds 3.5m loss on its two estate agency chains. Both its lending and savings businesses expanded during the year. The mortgage book increased from Pounds 4.32bn to Pounds 5.34bn, with net mortgage advances up from Pounds 1.18bn to Pounds 1.31bn. Mr Tony FitzSimons, chief executive, said that the society had 5,600 customers in arrears of 12 months or more at the end of 1991, about 3 per cent of its total mortgage customers. Savings rose sharply, growing from Pounds 189m to Pounds 436m. The cost-income ratio was up from 50.7 per cent to 53 per cent, but Mr FitzSimons said that the ratio for the building society operations was down from 41.5 per cent to 40 per cent. During the year the society spent Pounds 14m on developing its computer systems and Pounds 10m on new store developments. Mr FitzSimons said that the society had turned in a strong performance. 'Our balance sheet is absolutely rock solid,' he said.</p>

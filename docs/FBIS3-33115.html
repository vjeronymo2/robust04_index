			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Salvador, 15 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- The Farabundo  Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) today said the government  was "cynical" because it criticized the latest report on the  human rights situation in El Salvador. The report was prepared  by Pedro Nikken, an independent UN human rights expert.    Juan Ramon Medrano, the official spokesman of the former  guerrilla movement, stated at a news conference: "It seems to us  that the position of several officials, who said that Nikken did  not come to the country to verify the information in his report,  is a bit cynical."    In the document, which was presented at the UN Human Rights  Commission meeting in Geneva, Nikken expressed his concern over  the deterioration of human rights in El Salvador, adding that  the pace of compliance with the peace agreement "unfortunately  has weakened.    Presidency Minister Oscar Santamaria challenged the report  and strongly criticized Nikken. According to the minister,  Nikken prepared the report without visiting the country.  Nikken, however, recently stated he was unable to visit the  country because Salvadoran immigration authorities had not  processed his entry permit.    The FMLN's Medrano pointed out that "the government was the  one that blocked Nikken's visit," and he added that the report  had been prepared with information provided by UN officials who  are in El Salvador. Medrano said, "The fundamental aspect and  also what causes more apprehension is that the report  underscores the existence of armed groups with political  objectives, as the government calls them, or `death squads' if  you talk in plain Salvadoran Spanish." He added that up until  now, authorities have not solved the cases of 40 FMLN members  who have been murdered since the peace agreements were signed in  January 1992. "Furthermore, three FMLN directorate members were  also murdered and those cases have not been solved either, even  though there was initial evidence," the FMLN spokesman observed.    In his report, Nikken asserted that in 1993, the practice of  torture has claimed more victims in the country and that  "arbitrary arrests continue on a regular basis."    Meanwhile, Salvadoran Foreign Minister Miguel Angel  Salavarria requested in Geneva last week, that UN human rights  observers be withdrawn from El Salvador because of the  "advances" made after the conclusion of the civil war. However,  FMLN Adjunct Coordinator Marcos Jimenez stated, "The UN report  is an obstacle for the government currently because it shows  that the human rights issue must continue in the UN agenda in  Geneva." The FMLN leaders said the human rights situation in  the country was "serious."    FMLN spokesman Medrano also condemned the murders of two  leaders of Arena [Nationalist Republican Alliance] (governing  rightist party), which were perpetuated in separate locations by  unidentified people last Saturday. He likewise censured the  attack against an Arena deputy in San Salvador last week. He  said: "We condemn these events with the same energy with which  we censured the murder of our members. We demand a thorough  investigation of these crimes to ensure that they will not be  used to generate further confrontation and to show that the FMLN  party had nothing to do with them." He added that if any FMLN  member had participated in those crimes "the entire weight of  the law must fall of him because the FMLN Directorate and  members are on the road to peace."    The FMLN will participate in the first International Peace  Culture Forum to be inaugurated in San Salvador tomorrow. It  will be represented by a commission headed by FMLN General  Coordinator Shafik Handal.    The FMLN leaders criticized the government for refusing to  comply with several points of the peace agreements, mainly those  related to the implementation of programs for the social reentry  of former FMLN and Army combatants, the deployment of the new  Civilian National Police in the country, the transfer of lands,  and the reforms to the judicial system.</p>

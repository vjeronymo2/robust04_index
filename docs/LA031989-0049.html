			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIEWPOINTS;  </P> <P> WOMEN AT WORK: A NEW DEBATE IS BORN;  </P> <P> THE 'MOMMY TRACK' HAS AUTHORITIES ARGUING ABOUT WOMEN'S ROLES AT WORK  </P> <P> A recent Harvard Business Review article suggested that there are two basic  types of women managers -- those who put career first and those who need a  flexible schedule to take care of their children. The article, written by  Felice N. Schwartz, stirred controversy by recommending that companies should  accommodate women with these differing goals by establishing separate  "career-primary" and "career-and-family" tracks for women. But would such a  system really help women meet their career and personal goals? Or would it  pigeonhole women and institutionalize unequal treatment on the job? Free-lance  writer Meredith Chen raised these questions with a variety of authorities, and  excerpts from her interviews follow:  </P> <P>  Felice N. Schwartz, founder and president of the researcher organization  Catalyst:  </P> <P> "The article I wrote for the Harvard Business Review is an essay that is my  commentary as an informed, concerned person who has headed a research  organization for over 27 years. We have probably done more research at Catalyst  than any other group or research organization on the subject of women. . . .  </P> <P> "The vast majority of women need to work out of economic necessity. I think  also that a vast majority of women would like to have the opportunity to  participate more actively in the lives of their children than they can within  the present structure. I think that because of the new demographic realities  and because women are so prepared to make a contribution to corporate  management, companies now are going to enable women to have the flexibility  that they need.  </P> <P> "I predict companies will enable women to work on whatever schedule works for  them and to come back part-time. . . . The thing that I think is great about  that is that women will be able to be fully productive during those hours that  they do work and they will be able to take the time for parenting that they  want to take. Even poor women will be able to afford to cut back somewhat and  have prorated pay and not be deprived of the opportunity to be with their  children.  </P> <P> "I think that corporations aren't ready yet to respond to men. I think what  they condone for women they condemn, or at least look at as a lack of  commitment, from men. But . . . there is no question in my mind that the single  most significant, cost-effective thing that companies can do to release the  productivity of women is to legitimize and facilitate the role that men want  increasingly to take in family life. I think that what they do in response to  women, vis-a-vis flexibility, will be a model for what they do with men."  </P> <P> Jerome M. Rosow, president of the Work in America Institute research group:  </P> <P> "The criticism of Felice Schwartz's piece is a little bit of an over-reaction.  I think to some extent, she was defining the reality of what's happening. What  we see here is the leading edge of a trend of women with professional careers  who are becoming a predominant part of the American labor force, trying to  adjust the conflicts between work and family. Part of what we see in her  definition of the two-track phenomenon is an expression of the fact that women  need wider choices than men in their professional careers because they are not  relieved of the child-rearing responsibilities.  </P> <P> "It is not a question of being derailed from a career, but rather going on a  slower pace. What we are seeing is an elaboration of choice.  </P> <P> "The article demonstrates the tremendous impact of the feminization of American  workers. Large employers have been slow to adapt to the changing fact of women  in the workplace.  </P> <P> "I don't see the mommy track as a permanent track. I see it as a temporary  sidetrack for a large number of women who are highly motivated. Women who are  not allowed by the corporation to get back on track will be apt to leave and go  elsewhere where they are not treated like second-class citizens. The point is  that if you are going to get this track, it has to be by choice and  administered with equity."  </P> <P> Ann Morrison, co-author of "Breaking the Glass Ceiling" and director of the  Center for Creative Leadership:  </P> <P> "I think what Felice has done is to assume some givens. Instead of trying to  change the way some things are done, she has accepted that and proposed some  solutions that fall into existing givens. Those givens are not entirely  acceptable, and I think that is where the flak has come from. People are saying  that women shouldn't have to be solely responsible for parenting. The bulk of  her article assumes that women are going to continue to assume the  responsibility for child-rearing as well as child-bearing. A way to help women  out is to share the responsibility more fairly between two parents so that  there doesn't have to be a mommy track.  </P> <P> Richard Lewis, chairman of Corporate Annual Reports:  </P> <P> "I think that what Felice Schwartz was really saying was that you should  identify the fast-track people, the fast-track women who, in fact, don't want  to drop out and have children, and make sure that you don't have any false  barriers in their way. There is almost an assumption in business that these  bright women are going to drop out after 10 years and have children. If you  have some who are identified as not going to drop out, you can give them more  responsibility and training and keep them going up. It is a positive if you can  identify those few that will go straight up.  </P> <P> "I think it is a landmark subject, and it has not been talked about publicly  before. I think the reason is that on the one hand the feminist point of view  had been that women and men essentially are equal and there should be no  discussion of differentiation. In big business, there is a great concern over  being labeled anti-feminist. Men just don't want to do that, they'd rather just  duck the issue. Consequently, it really took a prominent woman with impeccable  credentials to bring the subject to the table.  </P> <P> "There may be men who want to go on a daddy track, but there is a real world to  consider here. Men accept the idea that a woman might take time off to take  care of a baby. At the same time, they would not understand why another man  would take time off, and men know that. They know that it would be out of step  and that is just the cultural bias. That is just the reality. It may be a good  idea, but I don't think at this point in time many men would do it."  </P> <P> U.S. Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.):  </P> <P> "When you have something in a journal as prestigious as the Harvard Business  Review citing two studies that they won't name or tell the methodology -- but  that says that women that have families cost (businesses) more than men and  therefore it is OK to have a second track -- I think we should jump on them.  </P> <P> "The new government statistics say that young girls in school are five times  more likely to be the sole support of their families as young boys. What  happens is that women know that and they are terribly conscientious about their  jobs, be they military or anything else. The way I read Schwartz's article is  that she is saying that we professional women are just tired of being held back  by you ladies who insist on having children. . . .  </P> <P> "The amazing thing to me is that (Schwartz) is getting back to the thing I  thought we buried years ago and that is you can't have a family and a career.  She is polarizing women and everybody loves it.  </P> <P> "It is very confusing and the most surprising thing is that Harvard would print  something like this."  </P> <P> Kirk O. Hanson, a corporate ethics consultant who teaches a business ethics  course at Stanford University that considers the trade-offs between work and  family:  </P> <P> "Many companies are structured in a way that makes it difficult for women to be  on the fast track. The clearest indicator of that is the marital status of  top-level executives. Some 95% of top-level male executives are married. Only  50% of top-level women executives are married.  </P> <P> "The dual track makes me uncomfortable if it is available only to women. In  fairness, it needs to be available to both men and women. One reason that it  should be available to men is so that it doesn't stigmatize women, and so that  it serves as encouragement for men to take on more of the child-rearing  responsibilities. It is inevitable that it will be primarily a vehicle for  women to manage the conflicting pressures of family life and work.  </P> <P> "In many companies a peculiar brand of macho has taken over where an  unnecessary standard of work is the norm. Many women who object to the mommy  track want to be more macho than the macho males who have run business over the  last hundred years.  </P> <P> "I teach a lot of MBAs who exhibit a peculiar brand of macho that leads them to  believe they can do it all, have a happy family life, work 70 hours a week and  achieve unlimited corporate success. There are trade-offs, and this is a  fundamental ethical decision that every business person makes whether male or  female.  </P> <P> "Current evidence is that women are voting with their feet when it comes to  making work and family trade-offs. Even among our most professionally oriented  women, there is strong evidence that they chose to modify their working hours  in order to put family priorities ahead at certain times in their careers. Few  of them see and have the opportunity to reintegrate onto the fast track, and  their talents, at the peak period of their careers, are lost to the companies  that might have taken advantage of them.  </P> <P> R. Gordon McGovern, chief executive of Campbell Soup Co.  </P> <P> "You have to try to relieve some of the tension and pressures that keep you  from getting at some of the talent that is in the female and male work force.  There are specific cases where people have come here because we had a  child-care center or have stayed because we had it.  </P> <P> "I think that job sharing is something we have to get accustomed to. There is  not resistance to it philosophically. It is the problem of putting the time and  energy into organizing it to make it work.  </P> <P> "I agree with Felice Schwartz that maternity should not be the thing that cuts  women off from getting to the top. . . . In the United States, 45% of our  company's total work force is women, and 23% of our management positions are  women. . . . I don't think it is enough."  </P></p>

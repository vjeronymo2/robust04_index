			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Bush suffers fresh blow in US primaries PRESIDENT George Bush suffered another setback yesterday as Mr Pat Buchanan, his rightwing challenger for the Republican presidential nomination, won strong support among party voters in Georgia and Maryland. In the race to become the Democratic party's candidate for president, two front-runners emerged: Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who won in Georgia by a big margin, and former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, victor in Maryland. Mr Bush won the primary elections of Republican voters in Georgia and Maryland and appeared assured of victory in Colorado. But Mr Buchanan's surprising showing turned the results into a Pyrrhic victory for the bruised president. In Georgia, where Mr Buchanan had concentrated his campaign, he appeared to have scored 39 per cent to Mr Bush's 61 per cent with more than half the polling precincts counted. In Maryland, exit polls and early returns showed him with more than 30 per cent of the vote, although he had hardly campaigned in the state. The outspoken television commentator based his Georgia campaign on a racially oriented appeal to conservative white voters, but his most productive theme remained his assault on Mr Bush for breaking his 1988 'no new taxes' campaign pledge. Mr Bush yesterday acknowledged that the 1990 budget compromise - in which he agreed to a tax increase - was one of the biggest mistakes of his presidency. But he remained determined to interpret support for his challenger as a protest vote directed at politicians in general, not just his own record in office. 'To those who have been with me in the past but did not vote for me today, I hear your concerns and understand your frustration with Washington. I am committed to regaining your support,' he said. Mr Buchanan still shows little sign of having a broad enough appeal to win even a single state from Mr Bush, but his repeated strong showings seem likely to kill any lingering hopes the Bush campaign may have nurtured that their irritating challenger might retire from the race. Instead, he appears sure to remain a thorn in Mr Bush's side right up to the Republican convention in Houston in August, weakening the president's efforts to prepare for the November 3 election. On the Democratic side, Governor Clinton's victory in the Georgia primary had been anticipated but the margin of victory outperformed expectations. With 57 per cent of precincts reporting, his tally topped 63 per cent to 18 per cent for Mr Tsongas. In Maryland, exit polls and early returns showed Mr Tsongas had won an estimated 43 per cent, against Mr Clinton's 32 per cent. Although the margin was narrower than Mr Clinton's in Georgia, Mr Tsongas in Maryland was outside his home region - unlike Mr Clinton in Georgia. In both states, the three other Democratic hopefuls - Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa and former Governor Jerry Brown of California - garnered so few votes that political analysts raised doubts about whether their campaigns could continue. But they still hoped their bids would be salvaged by the voting in other states yesterday: primaries in Colorado and Utah, and closed party caucuses in Minnesota, Idaho and Washington state. Results from these ballots were not expected until this morning. The seven states which voted yesterday account for 10 per cent of the delegates to the Democrats' nominating convention, to be held in New York in July. For the Republicans, only five states voted.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Republican Party Chairman Mykhaylo Horyn by </F> unidentified reporter; place and date not given: "Equal  Opportunities for Everyone"]    [Text] [Reporter] Do you think that democratic principles  will be observed in the upcoming legislative elections?    [Horyn] I believe that there are no grounds for grave  concern, although certain forces will probably want to create an  atmosphere of uncertainty and tension. In my opinion, the  situation could be normalized if the executive bodies take  preventive measures now.    [Reporter] Will the electoral law affect the results of the  elections?    [Horyn] The electoral law was meant to limit the influence  of parties on political life in Ukraine. We hoped that the  elections would be a great chance for many young parties to  grow, become stronger, and form the political basis of a  democratic society, but this has not happened. The majority  system has in fact put an end to hopes for a multiparty society.  This has happened, although all of Ukraine's democratic forces  demanded that a mixed proportional system be introduced.    [Reporter] How many candidates will the Republican Party  field?    [Horyn] According to preliminary calculations, we will have  more than 100.    [Reporter] What is your opinion about holding a referendum  on the main provisions of the draft constitution on election day?    [Horyn] This would only complicate the electoral process. I  would rather propose that this issue be resolved by the new  legislature. It would be very unwise to vote on the main  provisions without a preliminary discussion of the draft by  either the newly elected Supreme Council or the Constitutional  Assembly. I am against doing this.    [Reporter] Could you briefly outline your election platform?    [Horyn] Our economic, political, and military programs were  drafted as early as 1992, because we were the first registered  democratic organization and the first alternative to the  Communist Party of Ukraine. We believe that Ukraine should be a  multiparty parliamentary republic. Private property, coexisting  with other forms of property, should be the driving force of the  economy. We want the privatization program to provide equal  opportunities for all Ukrainian citizens.    [Reporter] What is your opinion regarding the tripartite  declaration signed in Moscow by Presidents Kravchuk, Clinton,  and Yeltsin?    [Horyn] I believe that this is a very important document  which requires thorough analysis.    [Reporter] How can this document affect Ukraine's national  security?    [Horyn] In my opinion, the adoption of the current version  of the document would deal a heavy blow to Ukraine.</p>

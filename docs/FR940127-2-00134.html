United of Omaha is a stock life insurance company that was incorporated under the name of United Benefit Life Insurance Company under the Laws of Nebraska on August 9, 1926. In 1981, the company changed its name to United of Omaha Life Insurance Company. United of Omaha is engaged principally in the sale of life insurance, accident and health insurance, and annuity policies, and it is licensed in all states (including the District of Columbia) other than New York. United of Omaha is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mutual of Omaha Insurance Company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Variable Account was established as a separate investment account under the laws of Nebraska on December 1, 1993 pursuant to a resolution of United of Omaha's Board of Directors. Under Nebraska law, the assets of the Variable Account are owned by United of Omaha but are held separately from United of Omaha's other assets and are not chargeable with any liabilities arising out of any other separate investments account or any other business of United of Omaha that has no specific and determinable relation to or dependence upon the Variable Account. The income, gains, or losses, realized or unrealized, from assets allocated to the Variable Account are credited to or charged against the Variable Account without regard to other income, gains, or losses of United of Omaha. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The Variable Account will invest in shares of one or more of the investment portfolios of the Variable Insurance Products Fund, the Variable Insurance Products Fund II, the Scudder Variable Life Investment Fund, and such other registered investment companies as United of Omaha may make available under the Policies from time to time (each, a ``Fund''). Each Fund will be a diversified, open-end management investment company, and may have a number of classes or series. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. MOIS will serve as the distributor and principal underwriter of certain of the Policies. MOIS is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a broker-dealer, and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Broker-dealers other than MOIS may also serve as distributors and principal underwriters of certain of the Policies, to the extent the Policies are sold through alternate distribution channels. Any such other broker-dealer will be registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and will be a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. The requested order would apply to any such other broker-dealer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The Policies may be purchased with an initial purchase payment of $5000 on a non-tax qualified basis or in connection with retirement plans or individual retirement accounts that qualify for favorable federal income tax treatment. A Policy owner may make additional purchase payments of at least $500 each at any time prior to the annuity starting date. A Policy owner can allocate net purchase payments to United of Omaha's Fixed Account and to one or more subaccounts of the Variable Account. The minimum amount that may be allocated is $500. Several annuity payout options are available to Policy owners. In the event that the Policy owner dies prior to the annuity starting date, a death benefit is payable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

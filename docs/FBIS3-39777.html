			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has said that the  goal in Bosnia-Herzegovina is not to launch an air raid at all  costs, but to end the siege on Sarajevo. He added that one  should not be very optimistic about the NATO announcement that  it does not deem it necessary to launch an air raid on the  Serbian positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina at this stage.    In an assessment to Turkish Radio and Television following  the NATO announcement that it does not deem it necessary to  launch an air raid on Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cetin recalled that  the regions outside Sarajevo are also under siege by the Serbs.  Pointing out that NATO should take action on that issue as  well, Cetin said Turkey will take steps to achieve this end.    Noting that he discussed the NATO ultimatum by phone with  Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, Cetin said: Our goal is  not to launch an air raid at all costs. Our goal -- everyone's  goal -- was to end the siege on Sarajevo. Now, are we faced  with a delaying tactic or have physical conditions prevented it?  This will be clarified in the coming hours. In our view, what  is more important is that one should not view this development  too optimistically.    Cetin stated that if, in the aftermath of recent  developments, the Bosnian Muslims are attacked and cannot defend  themselves, then the world and NATO will be responsible for the  consequences. Cetin added: By not lifting the arms embargo on  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the world, which bears moral responsibility  for all the tragedy that has been caused so far, will now be  directly responsible for what happens. I do not even want to  think that NATO will permit such a thing to happen at this  stage. I believe NATO will do what is necessary.    Cetin concluded by saying that the necessary pressure should  be applied to the Serbs and Croats to secure the just requests  of the Bosnians and that [words indistinct].</p>

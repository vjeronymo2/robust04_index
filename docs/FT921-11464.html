			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Survey of World Industrial Review (2): The hangover that persists - State of the Economy SHRUGGING off last year's soporific growth rates is proving hard work for the world's leading economies. This year should deliver more vibrant trading conditions; but only just. The world economy remains burdened by a hangover, following the late 1980s boom, that is taking longer than expected to fade. The world economy has probably avoided an outright recession. Back in 1982, the last time that total OECD output fell year-on-year, both the US and Germany were in recession. Growth was sluggish among the rest of the group of seven largest industrialised countries except Japan. The current downturn has been less synchronised. OECD activity reached its trough in the first half of last year, with around one third of the OECD countries in recession, including the US, UK and Canada. But overall OECD growth remained positive - up 1 per cent on the second half of 1990 - because of the still buoyant performance of Germany and Japan. The Japanese stock market crash of 1990 was not having the negative impact on consumption and investment that many feared. Meanwhile, the spending boom that followed German unification was fuelling west German growth and sucking in imports, thereby cushioning the economies of northern Europe. This healthy divergence of economic performance among the world's three largest economies began to turn sour in the second half of last year. The OECD remained relatively bullish in its July Economic Outlook, forecasting OECD output growth of 2.4 per cent in the second half of 1991 compared with the first half, and 2.9 per cent in 1992. It expected recoveries in the US and UK to outweigh a moderate slowdown in Japan and Germany. Yet both the US and the UK have failed to deliver their side of the bargain, while Japan is slowing faster than expected. By December, the OECD had cut its forecasts to just 1 per cent growth in the second half of 1991 and 2.2 per cent growth in 1992. Since then, the Bundesbank has raised German interest rates again, in an attempt to deflate rising wage demands in western Germany. Goldman Sachs has since cut its forecast for OECD output growth in 1992 to 1 1/2 per cent. What went wrong? First and foremost, the heralded US recovery has not materialised. The US economy, having suffered one of its shallowest post-war recessions, is stumbling through an equally slow recovery. Consumer and business confidence fell last autumn, following a brief recovery after the end of the Gulf war, depressing spending and orders. The evidence suggests that the US slipped back into recession in the fourth quarter. This 'double-dip' US recession has occurred in spite of an aggressive easing of monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve. US real interest rates, adjusted for expected inflation, have now fallen below 1 per cent. Yet consumers remain burdened by unprecedentedly high levels of debt, while banks are still accumulating bad loans. If anything, the UK is in a worse state than the US. It has not yet convincingly emerged from its recession, which began a quarter before that of the US. Further comparison with the US is instructive: the UK has a higher burden of household debt; its economy is trying to recover from a deeper recession; it suffers from higher underlying inflation; and has an exchange rate that is less competitive in world markets. Most important, however, Britain's short-term interest rates remain more than twice as high as in the US. Britain was the only member of the European exchange rate mechanism not to follow the Bundesbank's lead by raising rates at the end of last year. Yet real interest rates in the UK, and in France and Italy too, remain painfully high. The ERM will prevent any marked easing of European monetary policy until the Bundesbank starts to cut rates. With tension between the German metal employers and unions rising, and strike threats in the air, the Bundesbank may not cut rates until the early summer. The result is predictable: more slow growth across Europe, including Germany. The OECD's leading indicators of industrial production, which are designed to predict movements in actual output, suggest flat or falling output across Europe, the US and Japan in the first half of 1992. The one exception is the UK, whose leading indicator has been rising for the past 10 months. But there is little sign that UK output is responding. The one possible source of more robust growth in 1992 is Japan. The Japanese economy grew by more than 4 per cent in 1991. Moreover, the Bank of Japan has responded to growing signs that activity is weakening by cutting interest rates three times since last July. Yet this easing of Japanese monetary policy has been accompanied by a steady fall in business confidence, sluggish retail sales, and rising bankruptcies, especially among heavily-indebted small and medium sized companies. Broad money growth has fallen to unprecedentedly low levels, reflecting the Japanese banks' continued nervousness. Japan may well ease policy further over the coming months. But unless these rate cuts are accompanied by easier German monetary policy, and, more importantly, spark a rise in lending and spending as has not been the case in the US, the world economy could well face another miserable year.</p>

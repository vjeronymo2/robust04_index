			<p>BFN     [Text] Bacolod City -- A faction of the Communist Party of  the Philippines [CPP] allied with the exiled Jose Ma. Sison is  plotting to assassinate Arturo Tabara, chairman of the New  People's Army's [NPA] Visayas Commission and a bitter critic of  Sison.    The plan to liquidate Tabara and three other top rebel  leaders opposing the leadership of Sison, will be carried out by  the Melito Glor Command headed by Gregorio Rosal, Alias Ka  [Comrade] Roger, according to intelligence reports gathered by  the military.    Other rebel leader sentenced to death are Romulo Kintanar,  former NPA chief; Ricardo Reyes, then Secretary General; and,  Felimon Lagman, secretary of the Manila-Rizal Regional Party  Committee, the report added.    The liquidation of Tabara, Lagman, Kintanar, and Reyes were  confirmed by Ka Roger as published in the national papers.    Tabara is facing kidnaping charges in Tiaong, Quezon and is  detained in Fort Bonifacio, Makati.    Estelito Dioquino, former commander of the NPA in Southern  Negros, admitted selective liquidation is being practiced by the  underground movement on abusive policemen, paramilitary  troopers, and even army men.    He said he does not know about the claims of pro-Sison  forces  in Central Negros that Tabara and others are subjects of  liquidation by the other rebel faction.    Dioquino said the extent of punishment for abusive law  enforcers or individuals depend on the gravity of their acts  against the masses.    Dioquino used to be aligned with Tabara in the still  unresolved power struggle within the CPP-NPA.    The continuing criticism being waged by the Tabara faction  against Sison and its plan to establish a new party might have  forced the CPP mainstream officials to order the liquidation.    Col. Antonio Romero, 301st infantry brigade commander, said  a  bloody confrontation between the two rebel factions is possible  if reports about the liquidation of top rebel leaders are true.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / US lodges protest over Indian factory attack THE US embassy in New Delhi has asked the Karnataka state government to take 'swift and expedient action' against farmers who attacked the Cargill Seeds factory in the state on Monday. Embassy officials believe the attack against the US multinational, the second this year, could have ominous consequences for foreign investment in India. The American Business Council, to which all the leading US companies in India belong, has also expressed 'great concern' about the security of foreign investors in India. Mr Veerappa Moily, the Karnataka chief minister, has condemned the attack. The farmers fear multinationals may try to patent traditional seeds and enforce the patents under the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr Moily said his state's industrial liberalisation policy had been welcomed by investors and would create 20m jobs in the next seven years.</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Saudis take the heat out of Opec talks - A look at a meeting driven by 'economic self-interest' President Suharto of Indonesia may have been right when he told Monday's meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries that the peaceful atmosphere of Bali would pervade their usually troubled and acrimonious deliberations on oil prices. Or maybe it was just Bali's energy-sapping heat, as delegates from even the hottest Middle Eastern countries struggled to cope with temperatures in the high nineties fahrenheit and humidity to match. Whatever the reason, oil ministers yesterday succumbed easily when Saudi Arabia, Opec's largest producer, made it clear that it wanted quick agreement on its surprise plan to roll over Opec's existing production ceiling for the whole of 1995. Kuwait, Libya and Gabon expressed last minute reservations. But all resistance crumbled before the united front presented by the other eight members, including Iran, so often a dissenting voice within Opec. It was, however, 'economic self-interest' which drove the delegations to an early agreement, according to a Gulf Arab official. All the countries share a 'common goal' of lifting oil prices higher than the present level of about Dollars 17 for the benchmark Brent Blend. The differences at this week's talks were only about how to achieve it. The option of a three month roll-over was never seriously considered because delegates feared that it would merely set off renewed market speculation about Opec's next move. A cut was also not a serious option. 'I can't see any country willing to go below the ceiling,' said one delegate last night. Saudi Arabia dropped its widely-signalled support for the six-month roll-over option in the days leading up to the meeting. A Gulf Arab official said the six-month option could only have been justified 'if you believed' forecasts for 1995 which assumed that non-Opec would not be able to capture any of the 800,000-1m barrel a day increase in demand expected during the year. Saudi Arabia clearly did not, although the kingdom did not inform any of its colleagues about its change in position until Saturday, when Mr Hisham Nazer, its oil minister, arrived in Bali. The one year plan meets a number of Saudi aims, according to analysts. It sends a signal to the markets that the kingdom is prepared to forego volume increases in favour of firmer prices. It also largely eliminates market uncertainty associated with frequent Opec meetings. And, more importantly, it confirms that the Saudis want to shift the burden of maintaining stocks on to oil companies and refiners. A Gulf Arab official said he expected that the international oil industry would have to hold more stocks and compete more fiercely with each other for available crude oil supplies as a result of the agreement. The one-year roll-over also reflects a Saudi preference for Opec to focus on longer term goals, rather than trying to set short-term prices. 'Technical factors are more important than Opec' in the short term, said one delegate. But a Saudi official said the one-year roll-over did not necessarily represent a sea change in an oil policy that has tended to emphasise market share. 'We're not rigid in terms of market shares,' he said. 'We like a good share and a good price.' So will the Saudi plan succeed in achieving that aim? Opinions vary widely, with few delegates forecasting any big jump in prices. Many expect the benefits of the roll-over to be relatively modest, with little likelihood that the cartel will soon achieve its reference price of Dollars 21 a barrel for the Opec basket, an index of seven international crude oils. A big uncertainty remains the upward trend in non-Opec production. One Arab delegate yesterday admitted that North Sea operators 'out-manoeuvred us with their increased production this year'. There is also uncertainty about possible quota cheating by Opec states should prices rise. That was said to be Kuwait's biggest reservation about the plan. Mr Nazer declared yesterday: 'Over-production is a problem. We're very keen to have everyone abide by quotas'.</p>

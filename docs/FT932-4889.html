			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Clinton puts pressure on California in unitary tax row THE CLINTON administration is quietly pressing California to change its company tax laws in a way that may settle the long-running dispute over its worldwide unitary tax system while raising more money for the financially strapped state treasury. If the change were to be made soon enough, it might also head off retaliation threatened by the British government against US companies and spare the Clinton administration from having to take sides in the lawsuit between California and Barclays Bank, which is the test case for the unitary tax system. But some big California companies are beginning to move against the proposed change, which might cost them money, and state legislature officials say it will be hard to bring together the Democratic and Republican support it would need. US Treasury officials are encouraging California to move to a mandatory 'water's edge' system of corporate taxation, which state officials calculate could raise between Dollars 155m (Pounds 101m) and Dollars 175m a year of additional revenue. Under that system, companies are taxed only on income from operations within the borders of the US, whereas the worldwide unitary method calculates their global income and then taxes it in proportion to their payroll, property and sales within the state. California has already introduced water's edge reporting as an option, bowing to arguments from Washington that compulsory unitary assessments were inconsistent with the international tax system. Foreign companies, though, complain that they have to pay a fee to select that option, and that California reserves the right to overrule their choice and impose a unitary tax assessment. Moving to compulsory water's edge taxation would make California conform with the other 49 states and with most countries, and ought to settle the issues raised in the Barclays case, on which the Supreme Court has asked for the federal government's views. But 20 to 30 per cent of companies operating in California, including Caterpillar and British Petroleum, benefit from the unitary system, and have in the past lobbied against a move to mandatory water's edge report-ing. The administration does not want the risk of California losing before the Supreme Court; the state, still in recession and needing to fill another Dollars 8.6bn budget deficit by June 30, may stand to lose as much as Dollars 4bn on Barclays and other related cases.

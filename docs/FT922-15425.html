			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Average family 'better off' than a year ago THE AVERAGE family in Britain was better off in February this year than a year before, Reward Group, the employment consultancy, says in a report published today. According to the latest twice yearly cost-of-living survey from Reward, the income needed to maintain living standards fell by 4 per cent for the average family over the 12 months - the biggest such fall since 1976. However, only families buying homes with mortgages experienced the resulting increase in their standard of living. A drop of nearly 18 per cent in housing costs, reflecting falls in house prices, mortgage rates and the poll tax, was chiefly responsible for the fall. Poorer families living in council houses needed a 5.6 per cent increase in income to maintain living standards, the report finds. Reward says the Budget meant that a typical family living in a three-bedroom semi-detached house would be better off. The plans of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, meant the income required to maintain their standard of living would fall 1.7 per cent. UK Regional Cost of Living Report.

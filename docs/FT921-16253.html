			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Oil shipment helps Haiti rulers Haiti's military-backed government, facing an economic embargo by the country's neighbours, has received a temporary lifeline with the arrival of a shipment of oil from Colombia, Canute James writes from Kingston. The shipment of 165,000 barrels, mainly of diesel oil, was loaded at the port of Baranquilla on a Bahamas-registered tanker, and is in violation of the economic embargo imposed on Haiti by the Organisation of American States.</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Israel and the PLO: Knesset vote hangs on judgment of Rabbi Yosef - The battle shaping in parliament over the peace deal THE FATE of Israel's historic peace agreement with Palestinians could rest on the decisions of a shadowy 73-year-old ultra-orthodox rabbi who has emerged as a powerbroker during the last five years. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, was due back home last night to face a considerable challenge in mustering the parliamentary votes he considers necessary to pass the peace accord. He could be forced into calling a national referendum. Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, the country's leading ultra-orthodox oriental clergyman, is unelected but he controls the Shas party which has six critical parliamentary seats. Last week it quit the Labour-led government over charges of corruption levelled against leaders. How Shas votes in next week's Knesset debate on the peace agreement will decide whether Mr Rabin is forced into holding a referendum. The Baghdad-born rabbi has been keeping his cards close to his chest, saying he will decide how Shas will vote only after the Jewish New Year, which ends on Sunday. But Mr Arye Deri, the parliamentary leader of Shas and former interior minister, said yesterday he had recommended the rabbi should 'demand and insist' on a referendum to be held together with local elections due in early November. Mr Deri also said he had instructed the interior ministry, before he formally left the building yesterday, to prepare the 'infrastructure, law proposals and all the technical means for holding a referendum'. Although the prime minister has a 61-59 majority for the peace agreement in the Knesset he has consistently said he would not allow a peace agreement to be passed if it depended for passage on the five Arab parliamentarians. 'If we will have 61 votes for the agreement and 59 against we will go to a referendum,' Mr Eli Dayan, head of Labour's parliamentary faction, said yesterday. 'But if Shas and others abstain we will have to reconsider what to do.' Mr Ran Cohen, an MP of the left-wing Meretz bloc which is a part of the coalition, said his party would fight a referendum. Labour party officials said Mr Rabin would mount a lobbying campaign to convince Rabbi Yosef to support the agreement or, at the very least, instruct Shas to abstain in next Wednesday's vote. Mr Rabin is also hoping to win support from the three Knesset members of Agudat Yisrael, a faction within the orthodox United Judaism Torah Party. At least one right-wing dissident - Mr Ronni Milo, a senior MP of the opposition Likud party who is running for mayor of Tel Aviv - may also abstain or vote for the agreement. If Mr Rabin could win all nine floating Knesset votes he would have a 70-50 majority and would not be forced to call a referendum. Much will depend on how Rabbi Yosef, who rarely gives interviews, interprets Jewish law. In 1989 the cleric returned from a visit to Egypt and issued a 'halachic' rabbinical ruling declaring that giving up part of the biblical land of Israel was less important than the greater religious obligation of saving human life. A year later he brought down a national unity government led by Likud after it rejected talks with Palestinians. 'This might have led us, heaven forbid, to war,' he said at the time. Agudat Yisrael is also considering its position in the light of rabbinical teaching and is likely to be influenced by Rabbi Yosef's decision. Mr Deri has said the prime minister has so far failed to convince Rabbi Yosef that his ruling of 'giving away territories to save lives applies to the present agreement. There is a great danger to the lives of the settlers. There are great pressures on Rabbi Yosef to vote against the agreement. We have no obligation to vote for it - we are completely free.' Clouding the issue is whether Shas will remain in coalition. Mr Deri has alleged that charges prepared against him of fraud, breach of public trust and misallocation of government funds to Shas-supported religious schools and institutions are part of a wider campaign of discrimination against Sephardic or oriental Jews originating from North Africa, Spain and the Middle East by the larger and more dominant Ashkenazi or European Jews. Shas is wary of quitting the government for fear of losing the power to deliver funds and benefits to its supporters. If Mr Rabin is forced to call a referendum, political experts say he stands a good chance of gaining majority public support for the peace agreement. Latest public opinion polls show a 65 per cent majority among Israeli Jews for the agreement. A referendum would also include the votes of 800,000 Israeli Arabs who would support the accord. However, polls have shown that among those Jews who support the agreement a large percentage have security fears and could be influenced by a right-wing campaign for a No vote.  ----------------------------------------------------- KNESSET PARTIES  -----------------------------------------------------                                     Seats  ----------------------------------------------------- Left/centre  -----------------------------------------------------   Labour                               44   Meretz                               12   Arab Democratic                       2   Hadash                                3  ----------------------------------------------------- Religious  -----------------------------------------------------   Shas                                  6   United Tora Judaism                   4   National Religious                    6  ----------------------------------------------------- Right  -----------------------------------------------------   Likud                                32   Tsomet                                8   Moledet                               3  ----------------------------------------------------- Total                                 120  -----------------------------------------------------</p>

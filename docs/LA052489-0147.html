			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BROTHER OF GAMBINO CRIME BOSS CONVICTED IN RACKETEERING CASE  </P> <P> Gene Gotti, younger brother of Gambino crime family boss John Gotti, and fellow  crime soldier John Carneglia were free on bail today after 11 jurors convicted  them of racketeering and heroin trafficking charges.  </P> <P> The convictions Tuesday night ended seven days of deliberations and the  longest-running criminal case in the federal court system, stemming from an  indictment handed up in August, 1983.  </P> <P> The anonymous panel announced its verdict in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn  just four hours after Judge John Bartels dismissed a juror who said he believed  that he had been threatened.  </P> <P> Two previous trials in the last 18 months ended in mistrials, one because of  possible jury tampering.  </P> <P> The panel found Gotti, 42, and Carneglia, 44, guilty of all charges against  them.  </P> <P> Both were convicted of racketeering, possession with intent to distribute  heroin and conspiracy with intent to distribute heroin. Carneglia also was  convicted of interstate travel to further the commission of a crime.  </P> <P> Each could be sentenced to up to 50 years in prison.  </P> <P> Bartels rejected a request by U.S. Atty. Robert LaRusso to jail the defendants  immediately, allowing them to remain free on bail.  </P></p>

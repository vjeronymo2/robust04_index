			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Paraguay demanded true integration during the  Fourth Ibero-American Summit of heads of state and governments  held in Cartagena, Colombia. President Juan Carlos Wasmosy also  defended the right to life and stated his opposition to  abortion. The report on the president's activities in Cartagena  is summarized by SNT [Sistema Nacional de Television] special  correspondents Andres Caballero and Pedro Colman.    Cartagena implemented extreme security measures to assure  security during the summit. Without a doubt, the first  appearance of a civilian Paraguayan president at a summit and  the change of Fidel Castro's military uniform for civilian  clothes were noted by presidents and the press.    The international forum mainly discussed matters pertaining  to trade and integration as factors for Ibero-American  development. Wasmosy talked about Paraguay's need for an outlet  to the Pacific Ocean because of the country's landlocked  situation. [passage omitted]    President Wasmosy discussed the matter with the presidents  of  Chile, Peru, and Bolivia trying to find a solution.    [Begin Ruben Mengarejo, Paraguayan ambassador to the OAS,  recording -- in process] ...an outlet to the Pacific Ocean  through a road to Antofagasta. Chile's president, through his  foreign minister, committed his country's effort to finishing a  stretch of the road -- Paraguay will finish another stretch --  connecting Mariscal Estigarribia and Pozo Hondo to a corridor to  the Pacific Ocean. [end recording] [passage omitted]    All presidents participating in the summit are staying at  the  Cartagena Hilton Hotel. There Wasmosy met Spanish Prime Minister  Felipe Gonzalez and King Juan Carlos.    [Begin recording] [Wasmosy] He [Felipe Gonzalez] will visit  Paraguay between August and September. He will visit the Jesuit  ruins, our dams, and other areas of the country. We also have  agreed to establish a scholarship system for Paraguayan graduate  students. We explained to them our project to regulate the  Paraguay River's flow near Bahia Negra on the border between  Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay. It is a project that seeks to  regulate water flow, establish an irrigation system, maintain  the ecology of the swampy area in the north, and permit the  navigation of the Paraguay River, which also will benefit  Argentina and Uruguay.    [King Juan Carlos] I visited Paraguay not long ago. I have  been talking with my namesake [Juan Carlos Wasmosy], and I hope  I will be able to return soon. The president has invited me, and  I hope I will be able to include the country on my agenda, which  has to be worked out in accordance with the Spanish Government,  which decides on my plans. [end recording]    Wasmosy also talked with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria,  who was accompanied by his assistants. Gaviria said he will help  Paraguay from his position at the OAS.    [Begin recording] [Gaviria] Many American countries require  cooperation, particularly technical cooperation, and other  programs that help the OAS fulfill its mission.    [Wasmosy] He knows I have been one of those who worked for  his election to the OAS before other presidents. I think  Paraguay will have relevant participation in the OAS. [end  recording]    Wasmosy also met Chilean President Eduardo Frei. The two  presidents discussed investments and Mercosur [Common Market of  the South].    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Did President  Wasmosy put any conditions on Chile joining Mercosur?    [Ambassador Melgarejo] The overall wish is...[pauses] The  problem is the way the treaty is written. We are studying the  possibility of introducing changes into the treaty to permit the  entry of Chile and Bolivia, as the president....[end recording]    Wasmosy also met Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran Ballen.  Duran Ballen confirmed he will visit our country next September.    [Begin recording] [Duran Ballen] I want to visit Paraguay  after the Rio meeting [reference unknown] in September.    [Unidentified reporter] What issues interest you, for  instance?    [Duran Ballen] We are interested in learning something about  cattle raising; Paraguay has had great success in this area and  the area of energy. We are all acquainted with the large  hydroelectric projects in Paraguay. We want to learn something  from that experience. [end recording]    Wasmosy also met Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro. The  two presidents talked about problems affecting cotton  plantations and possible solutions. [passage omitted]    Wasmosy talked with Cuban President Fidel Castro on various  occasions. He asked Castro not to send instructors in guerrilla  tactics to Paraguay any more. According to Wasmosy, Castro  answered that he was only helping the Paraguayan people without  hurting the Paraguayan Government.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Do you continue to  justify his economic isolation despite the suffering of the  Cuban people?    [Wasmosy] We do not support any blockade. What we have asked  him for is an agreement, a proposal -- to give it a name --  permitting an increased opening and more freedom in his country.  [end recording] [passage omitted]    Various presidents agreed in pointing out that these  meetings  must produce more concrete results or more immediate  resolutions. Otherwise, people will continue thinking that these  types of summits are simply social meetings for the heads of  state and government.</p>

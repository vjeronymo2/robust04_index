			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE HANDYMAN;  </P> <P> WHEN IT COMES TO HANGING WALLPAPER, ALWAYS REMEMBER STEP 1  </P> <P> When John T. Hall goes to work each morning, he eagerly confronts something  most of us would just as soon pass by -- walls in need of wallpaper, and  sometimes wallpaper that needs to be stripped.  </P> <P> Hall is a professional paperhanger, an artist whose canvas is a bare wall on  which he carefully creates the special looks his customers crave.  </P> <P> From Hall's perspective, of course, most people would be better off turning to  a professional if papering is part of their decorating plan.  </P> <P> The Laguna Niguel resident has been hanging paper since 1973 and has learned a  few tricks in the ensuing 16 years. He agreed to share some of his knowledge to  make the task easier for those who would like to tackle it on their own.  </P> <P> And hanging wallpaper is something that the average handyman can do. All it  takes is the right tools, a positive attitude, patience, a little time and a  willingness to get a bit messy.  </P> <P> If you've been a homeowner for more than a month or two, chances are you have a  neighbor or friend who has botched a wallpapering job; you may even have blown  one yourself.  </P> <P> That's because after spending lots of money and time finding just the right  wallpaper, Hall says, many do-it-yourselfers doom themselves to failure at the  first step (often by skipping the first step entirely).  </P> <P> So here is the one thing to remember, if you remember nothing else about  wallpapering after reading this column:  </P> <P> Always, always, always prepare the wall you are going to paper, and prepare it  properly. No matter how expensive your paper, how carefully you match patterns  and fit the paper around corners and into window sills, no matter how carefully  you measure -- if the wall isn't prepared properly, the paper ultimately will  pop off, leaving you with ugly bubbles and peeling edges.  </P> <P> If you are starting with a smooth, painted plaster or gypsum-board wall, the  basic preparation is fairly simple. Wash the walls to be papered and fill any  holes, dents or gouges with spackling compound or other interior filler. Then  remove the light switch and wall plug plates and any other hardware or  ornamentation.  </P> <P> Finally, prime the walls, using a primer made specifically to be applied under  wallpaper. An oil-base primer is the absolute best -- and most expensive -- way  to go, but Hall said there are several good latex primers now on the market.  The primer takes the place of wallpaper sizing, gives you a surface with plenty  of "slip" for sliding the paper around once you've got it on the wall, seals  the wall and gives the paste a proper surface to adhere to.  </P> <P> If you are dealing with a textured wall, you have three options: Sand it  smooth; fill it out with spackling, wallboard compound or plaster until the  texture disappears; or, if it is only a very light texture, hang a lining paper  before putting up the wallpaper (for all but the most dedicated homeowner,  papering textured walls often calls for professional help).  </P> <P> The other common mistakes made by novice paperhangers, and Hall's tips for  avoiding them, are:  </P> <P> Trying to hang Mylar, foil or hand-printed papers themselves. These all require  special skills and tools, and are best left to a professional.  </P> <P> Not using the right type of paste for the paper being hung. A heavy-bodied  paste with a light paper is just as bad as a light paste with a heavy paper.  Hill and most other professionals also recommend pasting all wallpapers, even  those that come prepasted. Soaking prepasted papers is messy and the paper  usually comes out either too wet, so that some of the glue is dissolved, or not  wet enough, so that it won't adhere to the wall.  </P> <P> When pasting paper, using too light a paste can cause the paper to peel away  from the wall after a while, but using too heavy a paste can cause more  immediate grief. The tackier, heavy-bodied pastes set up fast and won't give  you much time to slide the paper around on the wall as you try to line each  strip up with its neighbor. Heavy pastes on light papers also can grab too  hard, both on the wall and when "booking" the paper prior to hanging it. In  either case, the backing can pull away from the printed surface, leaving you  with an unhangable paper.  </P> <P> Not buying enough paper. This comes either from a misplaced sense of thrift or  from mismeasuring.  </P> <P> Unless you are using a paper with no pattern or with a completely random  design, you will have a lot of waste on each roll. And you will find that doors  and windows don't save that much paper. Inevitably you won't be able to simply  cut strips 30 inches long for the wall under the window and 18 inches long for  the wall at the top.  </P> <P> You will have to cut full 8-foot strips, at least for the ends of the windows,  and trim big-but-not-quite-full-width pieces out of the center. If you don't  buy enough paper the first time, you will wind up either piecing things  together from scraps or face being left with a strip that doesn't quite match  because you had to pick up a roll from a different printing run.  </P> <P> To measure, Hill offers the following rules of thumb to determine how many  rolls you will need:  </P> <P> European, or metric, rolls contain 28 square feet of paper per single roll.  When the pattern repeats vertically every 18 inches or less, divide the total  square footage of the area to be papered by 22. If the pattern repeats at  intervals greater than 18 inches, for every additional 6 inches, subtract 1  from the divisor. For example, divide by 21 for pattern repeat intervals of 19  to 24 inches, by 20 for pattern repeats of 25 to 30 inches, and so on.  </P> <P> American rolls contain 36 square feet per single roll. When the pattern repeats  every 18 inches or less, divide the total square footage by 30. For pattern  repeats longer than 18 inches, subtract 1 from the divisor for each additional  6 inches; i.e., divide by 29 for pattern repeats of 19 to 24 inches.  </P> <P> Failing to use a plumb line to mark a perfectly vertical line on the wall at  each corner and for the first strip you hang. Once you get a strip of paper on  the wall even slightly crooked, the tilt magnifies with each subsequent strip.  The plumb line is a weighted, chalk-impregnated string that is snapped sharply  against the wall to mark a straight vertical line. The line should be made to  mark where the edge of the paper will be placed.  </P> <P> Not starting in the right place. Most wallpaper instructions tell you to begin  in a corner. But Hall suggests starting your layout at a window. In either  case, when you get to a corner, don't just wrap the paper around and keep  going. Each strip going into a corner should be cut so that about one-half inch  wraps around. Then a new chalk line is snapped on the unpapered wall, and a new  strip of paper is cut to butt into the corner, overlapping the excess half-inch  from the first piece and matching the pattern.  </P> <P> Not using the proper tools. That hunting knife in the junk drawer in the  kitchen might be sharp, but it isn't what you need to cut wallpaper. Use sharp  razor-type knives; a good steel straightedge; a high-quality sponge to wipe  down and clean the glue from the face of each strip after it is hung, and a  plastic squeegee or bristle brush for smoothing the paper once you've  positioned it on the wall. Use brushes for lightweight papers, squeegees for  heavier papers.  </P> <P> Going too fast. Take your time. The walls won't go anywhere, and if you can't  finish the job in one day, there is always another. It is better to take two or  three days to do a good job than to take one day to put it up, two days to peel  it off and two months to earn enough money to buy more paper.  </P></p>

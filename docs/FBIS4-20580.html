			<p>for   Boron Carbide Based Composites   <F P=102> 43070061K Tokyo ISBB'93 in English Aug 93 p 50--FOR OFFICIAL  USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 43070061K </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo ISBB'93 </F> <F P=105>  English </F> CSO   <F P=106> [English abstract of article by Koichi Niihara and Atsushi </F> Nakahira, ISIR, Osaka University; Tomohiro Yanai, Nagaoka  Institute of Technology; and Gen Sasaki and Katsuaki Suganuma,  National Defense Academy]    [Text] The effect of micro and nanostructure effects on the  mechanical properties such as hardness, fracture strength,  toughness and high-temperature strength were investigated for  the monolithic B[.sub]4[/]C and B[.sub]4[/]C/SiC,  B[.sub]4[/]C/TiB[.sub]2[/] and  B[.sub]4[/]C/SiC/TiB[.sub]2[/] composites. These  composites were fabricated by hot-pressing the homogeneous  mixtures of B[.sub]4[/]C, SiC and TiC powders in Ar  atmosphere at 1900 to 2200C. X-ray diffraction  analysis indicated that the TiB[.sub]2[/] was formed by  reacting the TiC with B[.sub]4[/]C during sintering. Scanning  and high resolution transmission electron microscopic  observation revealed that the finer SiC and TiB[.sub]2[/]  grains less than 100nm were mainly dispersed within the  B[.sub]4[/]C matrix grains, although the larger grains were,  of course, located at the grain boundaries of B[.sub]4[/]C  grains.    It is well known that the intragranular nanosized grains  improved remarkably the mechanical properties, in particular,  the fracture strength even at high temperatures in the composite  systems such as Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/SiC,  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/],  MgO/SiC, mullite/SiC, Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/TiC and  Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/]/SiC. As expected from the results  reported for these composites, the nanosized TiB[.sub]2[/]  and SiC strongly improved the mechanical properties of  B[.sub]4[/]C. The fracture toughness and strength were over  two times improved as compared with those of monolithic  B[.sub]4[/]C. And the improved strength and toughness did not  degradate up to the temperatures of 1200 to 1300C even  in the air atmosphere.    In this presentation, the processes micro- and nanostructure  mechanical properties relationship will be discussed in detail.  Special emphasis will be placed on the understanding of the  nanosized dispersion effects.</p>

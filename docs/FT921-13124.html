			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Further expansion despite fall NEWMAN TONKS yesterday announced that annual pre-tax profits had fallen by more than a third. In the year to October 31 they emerged at Pounds 15.1m, against Pounds 23.2m last time, writes Paul Cheeseright. Earnings per share fell to 9.56p (15.35p), but the dividend is maintained. A proposed final of 5.5p makes a total for the year of 9.3p. The group has continued its policy of expansion. It is buying, after a courtship of several years, Shapland &amp; Petter Holdings, the Barnstaple door manufacturer, from the Raynsford family for Pounds 13.4m. The payment will be in new shares and Pounds 2.33m of loan stock. The Raynsford family will receive 4.18m shares which will be conditionally placed and 2.89m shares which the family has agreed not to sell for a year. Newman Tonks is also buying Moller &amp; Auster, the Norwegian locks and security systems company, for NKr61.7m (Pounds 5.5m). Again the payment will be in shares: this time 3.79 new shares will be issued and conditionally placed. In addition to these two sets of new shares, Newman Tonks is issuing a further 5.01m shares. The placing of all the new shares will raise Pounds 17.89m after expenses. The placing price is 145p but there is a clawback arrangement for shareholders. They can buy one new share for every 8.5 they hold or one new share for every 17 convertible preferences they hold. Newman Tonks shares yesterday fell by 2p to 153p.</p>

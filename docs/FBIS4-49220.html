			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chen Decai (7115 1795 2088) and Reporter Liu Li (0491 </F> 0500): "Develop Rural Economy in an All-Around Manner and Make  Peasants Prosper at an Earlier Date"]    [Text] Spring left and has returned. The busy season for  spring farming has begun. To lose no time in successfully doing  this year's agricultural production and rural work, He Zhukang,  secretary of the provincial party committee, led the comrades in  charge of pertinent provincial departments to the rural areas of  Nongan, Qian Gorlos, Fuyu, Qianan, and Changling to conduct  investigation and study and guide work shortly after the  televised rural work conference held by the provincial party  committee. In view of the current problems in rural areas, he  emphasized: It is necessary to comprehensively analyze and  acquire a better understanding of the current rural situation  from the overall and long-term perspective, conscientiously  implement the guidelines of the central rural work conferences  and the rural work conference held by the provincial party  committee, fully stimulate and develop peasants' enthusiasm,  make the current spring farming successful, and aim at moderate  prosperity and the market economy in deepening reform,  restructuring the economy, and developing the rural economy in  an all-round manner to promote Jilin's rural work to a new stage.    During the investigation and study period, Comrade He  Zhukang  went deep into townships, towns, township and village  enterprises, and large households specializing in diverse  production and livestock breeding to learn about their  production and conditions of the people. He held a series of  forums of various types to hear the opinions of the grass-roots  levels and to pool the wisdom of the masses. He exchanged views  with city, county, township, and village cadres as well as  peasants on how to correctly assess the rural situation, how to  make peasants affluent as soon as possible, how to promote  agricultural modernization, the issues affecting peasants'  enthusiasm and rural economic development, how to fully  stimulate peasants' enthusiasm, how to strengthen leadership  over rural work, and the specific problems to be addressed. He  also held discussions with them to explore the ways to  accelerate Jilin's agricultural development and to make peasants  affluent and lead a moderately prosperous life at an early date.  Comrade He Zhukang publicized the guidelines of the central  rural work conference and the rural work conference of the  provincial party committee wherever he went, summarized and  extracted the rich experiences rural grass-roots cadres and  peasants had created in the course of practice, and gave many  important opinions on the work concerning rural areas,  agriculture, and peasants.    He Zhukang said: Thanks to the attention of the central  authorities and the hard work of cadres at all levels, peasants'  enthusiasm for production is high. This has not been seen for  many years. In addition, thanks to the deepening of reform, the  concepts of the vast number of rural cadres and peasants is  effecting a profound change, the correct principle of developing  agriculture in an all-round manner as defined by the provincial  party committee has become the people's common understanding,  the idea of the market economy has begun to take root deeply in  people's hearts, and it has become a common topic and urgent  desire to attach importance to information, stress the market  force, look forward to affluence, and march toward a moderately  prosperous life. The overall rural economic development trend  is very good, and the situation encouraging. We may say that  the current rural reform and development are in a new crucial  period, and, in particular, the rural economic development is in  a period of transition. Party committees and governments at all  levels should seize the current favorable opportunity to guide  action according to circumstances, step up work, pay attention  to implementing the guidelines of the central rural work  conference and the rural work conference of the provincial party  committee, fully stimulate peasants' enthusiasm, and promote  faster economic development in rural areas. He pointed out: To  develop rural economy further, we should first comprehensively  and accurately analyze and acquire a better understanding of the  rural situation, think more deeply over the development trend  from the overall perspective, and be more farsighted. In  particular, we should see the problems. We should not  overestimate peasants' income, investment capacity, and  agricultural development and be unrealistically optimistic.  Judging from the entire situation, rural areas are far from  being moderately prosperous, and tasks remain very arduous to  achieve a moderately prosperous life ahead of schedule; capacity  for sustained agricultural development has yet to be enhanced,  and to enhance the capacity, to a certain extent, is more  difficult than developing industry, involves more complicated  factors, and takes more time; and how to protect and  persistently develop peasants' enthusiasm remains an issue to be  properly addressed. Therefore, leaders at all levels should  further enhance their understanding of the position of  agriculture as the foundation, have a strong sense of work  responsibility and urgency, and, in compliance with the target  of moderate prosperity and the requirement for the market  economy, further emancipate the mind, deepen rural reform,  liberate and develop rural productive forces, proceed from and  aim at making peasants affluent and lead a moderately prosperous  life when carrying out the work concerning rural areas,  agriculture, and peasants, fully stimulate and develop peasants'  enthusiasm, and consolidate and develop the excellent rural  situation.    How to increase peasants' income and accelerate the pace of  attaining a better-off level of moderate prosperity? This is an  issue to which Comrade He Zhukang has paid great attention. He  stressed on several occasions that the task of prime importance  is to raise the agricultural labor productivity and let peasants  have work to do all the year round and generate profits daily.  The fundamental way out is to readjust the rural economic  structure, and make full use of and tap all sorts of natural  resources potentials in the rural areas. To readjust the  structure, it is most important to proceed from our own reality,  act in line with market demands, and accurately select items  with our own advantages and our own characteristics. Each and  every county, township, and village have different conditions.  We must not strictly demand uniformity. It is better to  develop things that suit a locality, grasp the characteristics,  and gradually make it grow more intensive, specialized, and  industrialized to form an optimal scale. Actively developing  township enterprises is an important aspect in readjusting the  structure. Developing township enterprises, however, needs  certain conditions. As far as the broad masses of villages and  households are concerned, during the initial stages, it is  necessary to pay attention to seeking avenues that are mostly  acceptable to peasants, and can be easily learned and  understood, with less investment and risks but noticeable  efficiency. Judging from the situation in various localities,  animal husbandry, courtyard economy, and diversified  undertakings can be initiated rapidly; they require less input  and a low degree of socialization; peasants are able to easily  approach them; and they have a vast market. They must be  regarded as a major task during the current structural  readjustment, and must be grasped well. In this aspect, we must  pay attention to summing up and popularizing typical examples,  and give play to their exemplary and initiating role. Peasants  are most practical. When they see typical cases with their own  eyes, they will follow them without having to be mobilized.  Nongan and Qian Gorlos have done a good job in giving play to  the role of typical examples and achieved structural  readjustment and economic development rapidly. In the  development of township industry, it is necessary to accurately  select the projects, pay attention to quality, and not seek  output value in a lopsided manner. Strenuous efforts should be  made to build a batch of dragon-head enterprises, and through  serial development, such as "all forms of integrated management  of trade, industry, and agriculture, and the link-up operations  of production, supply, and marketing," and such form as using  companies to bring along peasant households, effectively link  the production of all households with the domestic and foreign  large markets, increase efficiency, and reduce risks. In the  development of diversified economy and township enterprises, we  must persist in taking a high starting point, try our best to  adopt technologies of the present age, and have them attain the  level of our time. To accelerate development, it is not  realistic to do without advanced technology.    He Zhukang said: To readjust the industrial set-up and to  raise the labor productivity in the rural areas, it is most  important to raise the quality of peasants and solve the issue  that some peasants want to become prosperous but they do not  know how to do it and have no way to do it. Chairman Mao said  during the 1950's, the serious issue is to educate peasants.  This task has become more urgent today. Rural development  should be finally determined by the enhancement of the overall  quality of peasants. Nurturing a generation of peasants of a  new type with scientific, technological, and cultural mind that  fit the rural economic development, particularly the demands of  the market economy, is an arduous task. Relevant departments at  all levels should grasp it as a major task. In practice, all  localities should have some good methods and experiences. For  example, rural scientific and technological winter activities,  peasants' vocational education, the "three plus one" middle  school education, and "green certificates," are all feasible  methods which must be upheld and popularized with continued  efforts. Meanwhile, governments at all levels and all  educational and administrative departments should put peasants'  vocational and technical education high on the agenda and study  specific implementation measures. It is necessary to train the  existing labor forces in a planned manner, have plans, and set  demands on them. We should give consideration to adding  agricultural technology classes in the broad masses of rural  schools starting in junior middle schools this year, in addition  to running peasants' vocational and technical schools. Senior  middle schools, if conditions permit, should popularize Jian's  "three plus one" experience, strengthen agricultural science  technological knowledge training among peasants of a new  generation, and fundamentally intensify the agricultural  development momentum. This is a foundation work. All  localities must pay high attention to it and grasp it firmly and  well.    He Zhukang pointed out: Peasants are the mainstay of the  rural economic economy. The key to effecting a fundamental  change in the rural outlook and accelerating the pace of  agricultural modernization is to fully mobilize the broad masses  of peasants and to give play to their enthusiasm. Cadres at all  levels should firmly cultivate the viewpoint of believing in the  masses and relying on them, change ideological concept, improve  work style, and through emancipating the mind and deepening  reform, break the shackle of traditional mechanism and the mode  of thinking on peasants, give full play to the role of market  mechanism as an incentive for peasants, give a free hand to  peasants, and rely on the markets to solve the issue of funds  and technology. It is necessary to strengthen peasants'  organizational work, mobilize peasants through some carriers,  and boost the mass enthusiasm of peasants. It is necessary to  let peasants participate in policymaking in rural reform and  development, strengthen democratic management, make the masses  understand and support all sorts of rural work, and turn it into  their conscious action. Peasants have tremendous wisdom and  enthusiasm. If we let peasants participate in solving difficult  problems in the rural areas and mobilize their endeavors, all  problems can be solved and all undertakings will be a success.  Many localities can prefulfill the great project of making the  vast land of Jilin green in 10 years if the enthusiasm of the  masses is mobilized. All levels should fully understand this.    Agriculture is a weak industry. In the process of transition  into the market economic structure, the state should continue to  implement all sorts of effective supporting and protective  policies. But specific methods should be relatively changed in  line with the new situation. Continued efforts should be made  to reduce the burdens of peasants, and prevent the  "reappearance" of burdens. It is necessary to conscientiously  resolve the issue on hot topics which the masses of people in  the rural areas have paid close attention, do practical things  for peasants, help them eliminate misgivings, and enable them to  participate in the development of the rural market economy with  all-out efforts.    Developing and expanding the collective economy is the  material basis for forming cohesion of the rural party  organizations and appeal of grass-roots cadres, the fundamental  way for reducing peasants' burdens and resolving the rural  social security issue, and an important means for enabling rural  grass-roots cadres to lead the rural economy under market  economic conditions. On his way, He Zhukang repeatedly explored  ways of developing the village collective economy along with  rural cadres. He said: What can be managed by the peasant  households can also be managed by the village collectives. One  of the important targets of evaluating rural work and the  building of grass-roots organizations is to see whether they  have developed a collective economy. All localities should  adopt measures, be determined to make all villages have  collective economic units within the next two years, and enable  all villages across the province each with an annual revenue of  over 20,000 yuan at the least. In addition to formulating  specific plans, we should also implement target management and  work in a down-to-earth manner. Regarding those villages whose  collecive economy lacks development, we should organize efforts  to study them one by one so that all villages have collective  economic development items. Concerning villages with weak  leadership, we should make up our mind to send cadres to assume  posts and to define work objectives for changing their poverty  and backward outlook. In addition to developing their economy,  we should help them cultivate a good party branch secretary and  form a good leading body. We should care for the living of  peasant households with special difficulties, analyze their  situation one by one, give them suitable remedies, and adopt  practical and effective methods, such as giving social mutual  assistance, encouraging them to engage in development and  production, and providing them relief by the civil  administrations, in an effort to guarantee their basic life.    He Zhukang pointed out: In developing rural market economy,  we must invigorate the rural commodity circulation and pay  attention to cultivating and building rural markets, including  rural internal market cultivation and formation. The key to  linking production with supply and marketing lies in the dragon  head which means marketing, and market is the crux. At present,  the information for peasants is not quick and accurate and their  products are unmarketable. In a final analysis, these problems  are caused by the uncultivated and imperfect rural markets. It  is necessary to exert efforts to develop the market. In this  aspect, we should broaden our thinking, not only make good use  of the existing markets but also develop new markets, develop  small cities and towns in a planned manner, and realize an  integration of rural and urban efforts. This is not only a  necessity for developing the market economy but also the only  way for enabling peasants to become prosperous without making  them leave the rural areas.    During discussions with rural cadres, He Zhukang repeatedly  emphasized: New ideas and new methods are needed in leading  rural economic development. The past traditional leadership  methods characterized by giving orders, defining plans, and  hastening production and harvesting should be changed into ones  emphasizing guidance, support for peasants to enter the market,  and efforts to address the difficulties and problems in  developing the market economy. We should provide peasants with  market information, help them explore the market, establish the  socialized service system well, and render good service prior  to, during, and after production. In the transition to the  market economy, new conditions and new problems will emerge one  after another, of which many will be ones we do not understand.  Therefore, to lead the market economy, cadres at all levels  should intensify study, and those in the dark are in no position  to light the way for others. They should study the theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the knowledge  on the socialist market economy, and modern scientific and  technological knowledge. The recently published two books,  "What Is the Socialist Market Economy" and "Modern Scientific  and Technological Knowledge," are very good teaching materials,  and all levels should earnestly study them. We should attach  equal importance to the two civilizations and strengthen  grass-roots organizations. In particular, we should strengthen  the activities of party branches and leading party groups, hold  democratic meetings frequently and party branch sessions at  regular intervals and fully develop the role of party  organizations as leadership cores and the role of party members  as leaders and models. We should pay attention to establishing  village plans and village rules and regulations, crack down on  various criminal offenses, and check evil trends and bad customs  and habits, such as gambling, superstitious activities, and  lavish weddings and funerals, and transform social traditions so  that peasants can live and work in peace and contentment.    He Zhukang also emphasized on many occasions: A pressing  task is to concentrate efforts on spring farming and plant crops  well to stabilize Jilin's grain production. As 60 to 70 percent  of peasants' current income comes from grain production, rural  areas will be stabilized when attention is given to grain  production. It is hoped that all localities will lose no time  in spring farming and lay a good foundation for this year's  bumper grain harvest.    During the discussions in various localities, He Zhukang  affirmed the work of rural grass-roots cadres on many occasions  and expressed gratitude to their industrious work. He said: We  should both set strict demands on grass-roots cadres and fully  trust them to protect their enthusiasm well. Grass-roots work  is very complicated, and some of it is very difficult. We  should have a full understanding of the difficulties of  grass-roots cadres, support their work, and ensure the  implementation of the party's line, principles, and policies in  rural areas.    Participating in the investigation and study activities were  responsible comrades of the general office and the rural work  office of the provincial party committee, the provincial  agricultural bank, provincial agricultural department,  provincial water resources department, provincial township  enterprise bureau, and provincial supply and marketing  cooperative. Responsible comrades of Songyuan city party  committee and government participated in the inspections and  discussions in the various counties and districts of Songyuan  city. Wang Yunkun, standing committee member of the provincial  party committee and secretary of the Changchun city party  committee, and pertinent comrades of Changchun city party  committee and government joined the investigation and study  activities in Nongan.</p>

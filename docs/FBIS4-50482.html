			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Sutang (1728 1372 1016)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 16 May (XINHUA) -- According to  information gathered by this reporter from the Supreme People's  Procuratorate, Liu Bangyun, a worker at the Fangting Town Grain  Shop in Shifang County, Sichuan Province, and Huang Kaihong, a  former inmate in a reform-through-labor institution, used  industrial alcohol to brew a toxic white spirit, which they sold  for consumption, leaving four people dead and seven others  seriously injured. Liu Bangyun and Huang Kaihong were sentenced  to death after the Supreme People's Court verified the incidents  and gave its approval; they were executed by shooting in Sichuan  today.    In November 1991, Liu Bangyun, without applying for a  business license, rented a distillery in Huaishu Village, Yunxi  Town, Shifang County, illegally to brew and sell the white  spirit for consumption. In August 1993, Liu Bangyun hired Huang  Kaihong, who had been released from a reform-through-labor  institution, to promote sales. To seek staggering profits, Liu  Bangyun and Huang Kaihong hatched the scheme to lace the white  spirit with industrial alcohol. From 17-30 September 1993, they  bought 3.8 tonnes of industrial alcohol through fraudulent means  on four occasions, and mixed it with water to produce some 20  tonnes of the white spirit in bulk, which they sold in Shifang  and Guanghan Counties. At the distillery, they also retailed  the spirit to people in nearby villages.    On 9 October 1993, Ye Shaofu and Ye Shaorong, two brothers  in  Huaishu Village where the distillery is located, bought 28 jin  of the white spirit in bulk from the distillery for a funeral  dinner in memory of their late father. Many guests at the  dinner suffered from methanol poisoning after drinking the  spirit. Although they were given emergency treatment in a  hospital, Ye Shaofu, Ye Shaorong, and several people who  suffered from poisoning sustained severe eye damage and lost  their sight as a result. At midday on 12 October 1993, Chen  Zhonghui, a woman in Qingming Village, Yunxi Town, entertained  guests at her home. In all, she drank about three liang of the  spirit, during the day and at night. After the drinks, her  vision turned blurry, and she was too weak to walk. She died on  that night. During the 10-day period from 4-14 Ocotber 1993, 11  cases of alcohol poisoning were reported one after another in  Yunxi Town and Minzhu Township in Shifang County, leaving four  people dead, seven seriously harmed, and three with minor  injuries. An investigation confirmed that the white spirit  consumed in all 11 cases was brewed by Liu Bangyun and Huang  Kaihong. Following an autopsy of the dead, and testing of the  poisonous substance and samples of the spirit, relevant  departments found that the white spirit, brewed by Liu Bangyun  and Huang Kaihong through mixing with industrial alcohol,  contained methanol whose minimum and maximum contents were 229  and 330 times higher than those set by the state for health  reasons. Just drinking a small amount could leave people blind  in both eyes or dead. After the incidents, more than 10,000 jin  of the toxic spirit, which had not yet been marketed, and which  had methanol contents more than 250 times higher than those set  by the state, was found at Liu Bangyun's distillery.    By wantonly using industrial alcohol to brew the harmful  white spirit for sale, Liu Bangyun and Huang Kaihong seriously  endangered society and people's lives. Ruling in accordance  with the Criminal Law and relevant decisions of the National  People's Congress Standing Committee, the Deyang City  Intermediate Court convicted Liu Bangyun and Huang Kaihong on  charges of brewing and selling toxic and harmful foods. Because  the circumstances of the crime and the consequences of the harm  inflicted on people were both exceptionally serious, the court  sentenced Liu Bangyun and Huang Kaihong to death in accordance  with the law, deprived them of their political rights for life,  and fined Liu Bangyun 3,300 yuan. Liu Bangyun and Huang Kaihong  disagreed with the ruling and filed an appeal. During  second-instance proceedings, the Sichuan Provincial Higher  People's Court rejected the appeal and upheld the original  verdict.    A responsible person from the Supreme People's Court pointed  out: Criminal activities in producing and selling counterfeit  and substandard goods, especially toxic and harmful foods,  directly endanger people's lives and safety. People's courts  should continue to mete out stiff punishment for such criminal  activities in accordance with the law.</p>

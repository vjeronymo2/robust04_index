			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zayra Pereira; from the "Union Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Text] In a communique issued by the National Banking  Council, which met the morning of 15 June, representatives of  the financial sector expressed their position on the  government's abrupt decision to intervene in seven banks and one  finance company. (Jose Monzi Izquierdo), National Banking  Council president, read the communique:    [Begin (Monzi Izquierdo) recording] The National Banking  Council and the Venezuelan Banking Association would like to  clearly express our amazement on the decision to intervene and  close a group of financial institutions that were receiving  financial assistance from Fogade [Deposit Guarantee and Banking  Protection Fund]. The government has adopted that decision  without notifying the financial sector, and that is why we have  been unable to understand the logic behind such a measure.    As such, we neither share nor support this decision. We join  the rest of the country's desire to be kept fully informed on  the fate that awaits these institutions. In addition, we request  that depositors and employees be treated with justice and  fairness. [end recording]    (Jose Monzi Izquierdo) has reiterated an official position  regarding the closure and intervention of the financial  institutions will be announced after they receive a clear  explanation of the issue; he has also expressed his desire to  become actively involved in assisting the financial institutions  due to their decision to trust the government's support.</p>

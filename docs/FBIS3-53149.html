This came in the enlightenment which his  excellency presented at the assembly's session today about a  parliamentary delegation's visit to the Upper Nile State.    Muhammad al-Amin Khalifah explained that the brothers, who  were bearing arms, reached the firm conviction of the  inevitability of the halting of the war and saw that the war  should come to an end. He said he met a number of the  leaderships of the united factions of the rebel movement in the  Fangak area, who confirmed their decision to stop the fighting  and formulate peace and lead the march of construction and  development.

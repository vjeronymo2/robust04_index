			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhen Yan (3914 6056): "An Analysis of the State </F> of Macroeconomic Regulation and Control in 1993"]    [Text] Macroeconomic regulation and control had a profound  impact in the two areas of economic growth and system reform in  1993. To analyze 1994's macroeconomic regulation and control  policy results, we will first review the economic setting that  caused the Central Committee to take macroeconomic regulation  and control steps.  <H5>  I. The State of the Economy From 1992 to the First Half of </H5> 1993    In early 1992, the inspiration of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  southern-tour speeches set off an upsurge of faster economic  growth everywhere throughout China so that, once the state of  economic stagnation that had been extant since the improvement  and rectification campaign was changed, economic growth in all  areas steadily jumped to new heights. But as China's new  economic system based on a market economy had not yet been  established, various flaws of the old system resurfaced. All  areas competed to build new shops and stores, reexpanding the  scale of capital construction in particular, while "bottleneck"  industries, such as power and transportation, did not grow  correspondingly, causing a tense situation of supply not meeting  demand for both commodities and capital. Statistics show that  our 1992 GNP was up 13 percent from 1991's, while this tense  macroeconomic state intensified steadily in the first half of  1993, becoming a glaring threat to economic growth.    Along with this economic phenomenon of too fast economic  growth, our macroeconomic financial order during this period was  in chaos, spurring public capital-demand to exceed normal  limits. This was seen mainly as:    1. Interbank borrowing was enormous, with quite a few money  markets converting to currency markets. As direct central-bank  control of the credit scale restricted to a certain extent  enterprise loan-demand, while call markets grew rapidly through  financial-system reform, borrowing became a key source of  capital for enterprises to breach state control. As the central  bank and state specialized banks in all areas also wanted, due  to a variety of reasons, to do all possible to satisfy these  enterprise aspirations, their capital outflow in non-loan forms  was huge. It was reported that other state-bank fund-source  account-headings in 1992 were down 152.43 billion yuan, or 42.8  percent of the increased loans for the same period. And in the  first four months of 1993, they were down another 79.909 billion  yuan. Net lending by specialized banks was up 59.32 billion yuan  in 1992, as well as up again somewhat for the first four months  of 1993. By May 1993, 14.3 percent of loan capital was being  used by non-money markets.    2. All types of fundraising activities arose one after  another. While these funds were all beyond-plan, making it  hard to ascertain their scale precisely, we can see from the  results they caused the extent of the fundraising impact. a)  This fundraising was without exception through means that  promised interest rates higher than those for bank savings  deposits, with the widespread extent of the fundraising  activities raising real capital prices (interest rates) above 20  percent. b) The huge gap between these fundraising-capital  interest rates and official ones caused a large national  savings-decline and a bank-payment crisis. It is calculated that  real savings deposits were down at least 80 billion yuan from  the savings deposit balance trend-value, or 22.4 percent of the  1992 loan increase.    3. Development-zone, real-estate, and stock fevers  attracted much construction capital. As much as 75-80 percent  of loan funds were loaned at high interest to certain economic  subjects that used them for purposes, such as real estate and  stock speculation, with many enterprises and institutions even  drawing on regular production working capital or high-interest  fundraising to take part in speculative selling. So real  estate and stock prices climbed time and again, showing a false  market prosperity of supply not meeting demand, and forming to a  certain extent a so-called "bubble economy."    In addition, foreign-exchange conversion prices, also due to  many reasons, were speculated in a short period to the boiling  point, with the real exchange rate of the RMB to the dollar  reaching 11 : 1 for a time.    Such a macroeconomic state unavoidably had the following  consequences: a) funds were in severly short supply for  priority enterprises and construction projects that played a  mainstay role in national economic growth, as well as for  indispensable farm products and foreign-trade purchasing  activities, impacting normal economic activities; b) the "bubble  economy" expanded rapidly, tending to flow over into other  economic sectors; c) inflation remained high, in danger of  high-speed growth under "bubble-economy" conditions; d) high  inflation was about to severely obstruct the sound growth of our  national economy.    So the Central Committee officially decided in June 1993 to  apply macroeconomic regulation and control to national economic  operations.  <H5>  II. Macroeconomic Regulation and Control Application and </H5> Results    Directed at the state of operation of our national economy,  the state adopted the principles of rectifying the financial  order, optimizing the industrial structure, raising economic  efficiency, and promoting balanced, rapid, and sustained  economic growth, by doing all possible to abandon the  indiscriminate method of all-out tight money, in order to ensure  the funds needed for farm and sideline product purchasing,  normal production by priority enterprises, national priority  construction projects, and foreign-trade purchasing and  operations. So we adopted mainly the following regulation and  control policies:    1. We tightened overall monetary demand, strictly  controlling overall credit. The Central Committee instructed  all areas to conduct a one-time, all-out examination and  verification of our project and fund-use lineup, deciding to  halt or slow projects that did not conform to national  industrial policy, did not have construction funding, and had  not been examined and approved per stipulation, to strictly  control the construction of new projects, and to not approve in  principle any new construction projects for the last 4 months of  1993. We tightened credit so that all bank loans grew only  99.3 billion yuan for the first half of 1993, 26.3 billion yuan  less than for the same period in 1992.    2. We regulated the economy through market-economy means.  In May and July 1993, the central bank raised bank deposit and  loan interest rates twice, with the finance sector also  correspondingly raising 1993 treasury bill interest rates.  Based on improving foreign-exchange management, the pertinent  state sector gave up some of its foreign-exchange intervention  in market exchange rates, stabilizing the rate of exchange  between the RMB and the dollar at about 8.7:1.    3. We improved our financial order through administrative  means. a) We made a few simple rules to be observed by all  concerned in the financial system: all illegal lending was to be  immediately stopped and conscientiously cleared up, with  deadlines set for recouping illegally loaned funds; no financial  institutions were allowed to covertly raise deposit and loan  interest rates, or collect kickbacks from loan subjects; the  input of credit funds by banks into all economic entities run by  them was to be immediately stopped, with banks having to  completely dislink themselves from all of their own economic  entities. b) We strictly enforced tax-revenue policy. The  tax-revenue sector had to strictly control tax reductions and  exemptions, strictly control spending, and further cut back the  growth of social-group purchasing power. c) We cleared up  compensated fundraising activities. Except for the sale per  stipulation of stocks, enterprise bonds, financial bonds,  investment-fund bonds, and trust-beneficiary bonds, all  fundraising activity compensated by repayment of capital with  interest or payment of dividends and bonuses to capital  contributors was temporarily stopped. We particularly  stipulated that compensated fundraising activities by state  organs, institutions, and social groups directed at employees  and the public were prohibited.    Such a large-scale macroeconomic regulation and control  policy produced in a very short time remarkable results:    1. Industrial production, while maintaining high-speed  growth, fell steadily, with the excessive growth momentun of  fixed assets controlled somewhat. State Statistical Bureau  information shows that state-unit investment growth, in  comparison to the same periods in 1992, was 70.7 percent for the  first half of 1993, but 66 percent for the third quarter, down 9  points. As to investment sources, the ratio of self-raised funds  at all levels also correspondingly fell from 86 percent to 76  percent, with the industrial growth rate down from its  first-half of 25.5 percent to 22.5 percent for September, and  down again to 16.4 percent for October.    2. Our financial situation and order began to improve. This  could be seen mainly as: a) The currency-input growth-trend  slowed. While our money supply growth reached a high of 54  percent for the first half, four consecutive months of lower  input in the last half in relation to the same periods in 1992  brought our market money-supply growth down by the end of  October to 38.6 percent, 15 points lower than for the first  half. b) Specialized bank payment-readiness funds quickly  rebounded, reaching about 10 percent by the end of October. In  addition, the PBC injected 20 billion yuan of funds into all  financing centers, resolving bank-payment problems, and starting  to invigorate normal interbank lending; c) The illegal  bank-lending phenomenon began to be corrected, with a net of  over 30 billion yuan in loaned funds recouped, or one-third of  that recoupable. d) All arbitrary fundraising began to be  curbed, with actions, such as high-interest fundraising and  financial swindling, severely cracked down on. e) The higher  interest-rate policy showed marked results, with savings  deposits climbing monthly to reach a balance of 1.3867 trillion  yuan by the end of September, up 232.2 billion yuan from that at  the end of 1992. f) Foreign exchange conversion prices  stabilized at the policy-anticipated control level.    3. The development-zone and real-estate fevers in all areas  cooled somewhat, with real estate prices in coastal zones down  about 20 percent. Correspondingly, capital goods supplies  loosened, with investment-product prices back down somewhat.  According to a report in ZHONGHUA GONG-SHANG BAO [CHINA  INDUSTRIAL-COMMERCIAL REPORT] for October, the domestic  commodity market price index was down 2.8 percent, including  drops of 6 percent for ferrous metals, 2.3 percent for  nonferrous metals, 0.8 percent for industrial chemicals and  light industry, and 2.6 percent for machinery and electronics  products.    4. Loans to ensure national priority projects increased  sharply. As much as 93.9 percent of the funds for 112  state-loan-invested national priority projects were provided.    For 65 priority projects in the transportation, post and  telecommunications, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, light  textiles, and other industries, all of the loan funds in 1993  plans were provided; 71 percent of technological upgrading funds  were provided, up 7.5 points from the same period in 1992;  foreign-trade loans grew over 10 points more than foreign-trade  exports; farm and sideline-product purchasing loans grew to 12  billion yuan for October, with the Agricultural Bank having  specially set aside over 22 billion yuan in preparation for  purchasing.    While this shows that this macroeconomic regulation and  control policy's objectives had basically been or were being  realized, many negative regulation and control effects still  needed much attention.    1. Enterprise operating-fund difficulties remained quite  glaring. In order to alleviate these difficulties, the PBC  issued 150 billion yuan in basic money supply to specialized  banks from late August to late October, increasing the lending  capability of specialized banks. But while this should have  improved the overshortage of funds generally, a time-lag was  involved, meaning that we still needed to see if the lending  structural reform was appropriate.    2. Enterprise inventories grew, with losses up and economic  efficiency declining. By the end of September, finished  products were tying up 152.67 billion yuan in funds, up 14  percent from the same period in 1992; State Statistical  Bureau data on inventories of 75 key manufactured goods showed  54 up from the beginning of 1993, with 11 goods, such as rolled  steel, tin, and concentrated nitric acid, up more than 100  percent. By the end of September, inventories were up from the  beginning of 1993 by 2.664 million tons for cement, 53,400  vehicles for automobiles, and 4.03 million tons for rolled steel  goods throughout China. For October, finished-goods inventories  of budgeted state-owned industrial enterprises were up 19  percent from the same period in 1992, with realized profits down  21.8 percent from September. As many as 37.8 percent of  enterprises were sustaining losses, which losses were up 9.1  percent from September. "Triangular debt" resurged, with mutual  arrears recurring, leaving net accounts-due by the end of  October topping 210 billion yuan, up more than 40 billion yuan  from the end of July.    3. Fixed-asset investments continued to grow too fast. While  the macroeconomic regulation and control steps had controlled  new projects that had not yet gone into construction in 1993,  the building of new shops that had begun in all areas was  certainly not genuinely cut back, with national priority  construction projects striving to complete plans, making it  impossible to reduce the investment scale in the short term.  Fixed-assets investment for the first three quarters was still  up over 65 percent from the same period in 1992, leaving  market-demand pull and inflationary pressures certainly not  markedly lighter.    4. Final public demand showed a weakening trend, with  markets slightly soft. For October, overall retail commodity  turnover corrected for inflation actually grew only 5 percent;  investment-product demand corrected for inflation actually grew  less than in 1992; export demand remained slow, with customs  exports for October up only 5.1 percent from the same period in  1992. In addition, commercial-purchasing zeal was not high,  with net commercial purchases of manufactured goods for October  up only 10.5 percent, 16.1 points lower than for June.    5. In clear contrast to the slight downturn in  investment-product prices, consumer-goods market prices saw a  sustained upswing. For the first three quarters, overall  retail prices rose 12 percent, while the cost-of-living price  index rose 14 percent, including 18.9 percent for the 35 large  and midsize cities, to reach a peak-state since economic reform.  Prices in all areas throughout China rose simultaneously in all  dimensions, forming a moderate degree of inflation.  <H5>  III. An Analysis of the Macroeconomic Regulation and Control </H5> Policy's Effects    While this macroeconomic regulation and control policy was  generally correct in direction and appropriate in degree, to  basically achieve a "soft landing" without a sharp economic  retrenchment, such macroeconomic regulation and control through  mostly administrative measures would have damaged to a great  extent the regular operations of many enterprises. Phenomena,  such as the heavier "triangular debt" and soft market sales for  enterprises at the time, showed that the macroeconomic  regulation and control was too sharp in force, leaving an  appropriate easing of the money supply the inevitable option for  maintaining a certain economic-growth rate.    Our economic operations after the macroeconomic regulation  and control showed a seemingly contradictory economic  phenomenon. On one hand, higher inventories, declining  efficiency, and soft markets showed inadequate market demand; on  the other, too high investment growth and rapid retail-price  rises showed an abundance of funds and strong demand. As to  funding, while the central bank had recently issued 150 billion  yuan in basic money supply, enterprises were again forming  "triangular debt" on a large scale due to fund shortages. We  hold that two basic factors created this situation. a) The  macroeconomic regulation and control impact still existed, and  was going to for a short time, as the new funds injected by the  state had not yet reached all economic players. b) This  macroeconomic regulation and control was structurally  characterized by a guarantee of priority-project fund demand,  with a cutback of nonpriority-project fund demand. But in our  current economic operations, nonpriority projects were sharply  driving market demand, with the demand inadequacy created by the  fund shortage for this sector lasting for quite a long period of  time. So as time passed, the conflicts in our economic  operations would be bound to improve somewhat.    In order to prevent the recurrence of such macroeconomic  overheating, the state still had to make follow-up policy  adjustments in many areas. As to the factors producing this  "bubble economy," on one hand, the severe market imbalance  created by administrative monopoly had artificially raised  market prices in many fields, thus causing excessive  profiteering and speculation; on the other, our financial  system's responsibilities were hard to separate, with policies  imbalanced, leaving large amounts of funds, induced by market  interests, to successfully detour policy restraints. So for  our financial system, development zones, real estate market, and  securities market, we had to combine administrative regulation  and control with market reforms, by clarifying all policy  limits, as well as making a timely adjustment in line with  economic reform and growth needs, in order to prevent "the  exploitation of authority for private market gain," and to  control the direct factors driving economic overheating.    To keep our national economy growing in a sustained and  balanced way, we had to root out the basic factors leading to  economic overheating. This grim macroeconomic state caused  mainly by changes in the field of finance was essentially part  of the economic-fluctuation cycle of expansion -- retrenchment  -- expansion of our traditional planned-economy system, being of  an unavoidable nature. As current systems, such as investment,  finance, tax revenue, and enterprise, still largely placed soft  budgetary restraints on enterprises, forcing local microeconomic  interests on our conversion to a market-economy system,  investment expansion was an inherent demand of enterprises and  local governments in all areas. While this demand had to  acquire funding support from the field of finance, our banking  system per se was still in a reform process, unavoidably still  burdened with the dual responsibility for both policy and  commercial loans. As commercial loans were consistent with  their own interests, banks were bound to transfer some  policy-loan funds to commercial-loan funds, through means, such  as irregular lending of funds and issuing of IOUs, leaving the  priority-guaranteed policy-loan-fund shortage to the central  bank, for a bottom-up forcing of the state to increase the money  supply. It is thus obvious that the nonmarket-oriented system  was the basic reason for the macroeconomic expansion touched off  by market reform. So promoting sustained and balanced economic  growth under the new conditions meant establishing an effective  market-economy system. In addition to investment, taxation,  market-circulation, and enterprise-system reform, our currently  most important task is to establish a more rational financial  system. This will include: 1) Establishing a central bank  with independent authority, whose primary task will be to  maintain the value of the currency and prevent excessive  inflation, while paying attention to policy loans. 2) Thoroughly  reorganizing state specialized banks into commercial banks, to  carry out businesslike operations with no further responsibility  for policy loans. 3) Actively pushing forward with the  establishment of a securities market, by increasing stock and  bond supply to meet market demand. 4) Appropriately easing  restrictions on private financial institutions, to make the  financial industry more competitive in regular market  operations. In such a financial framework, the state will have  a solid system-basis for developing indirect macroeconomic  regulation and control, while market restraints between  enterprises and banks will correspondingly strengthen.    In order to smoothly convert from our existing system to a  market-economy system, macroeconomic policy has to pay great  attention to quantitative control. In light of China's  realities, our macroeconomic policy must curb economic  overheating and excessive inflation, by regulating and  controlling in line with set quantitative criteria. But in  issuing currency, we not only must consider economic growth  rates and a sustainable degree of inflation, but also have to  accomodate a certain amount of economic-monetarization factors.  In China's future economic reforms, two areas will obviously  increase our economic-monetarization extent. 1) The  commercialization of production factors, such as the rise of the  securities market, development of the real estate market, and  other forms of market-building, will objectively absorb a lot of  capital, absolutely increasing public monetary demand. 2) The  oil-price reform already set by the state will be bound to  sharply change China's price system. As oil is the major  energy source for modern industry, having a huge chain-reaction  on downstream industries, price reform involving mainly higher  crude prices will inevitably raise all of our prices to new  highs. So it will be only by acting on historical experience  and real needs to set a rational economic-monetarization rate,  that will enable us to prevent severe inflation, while retaining  full market-economy vitality.</p>

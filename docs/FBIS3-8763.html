			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jerzy Pilczynski: "Another Citizens' Initiative"] </F>   [Text] An Extraordinary Committee working on bills of  amendments to the procedures for preparing and passing the  Constitution has completed its work. At one of its coming  sessions, the committee, chaired by Democratic Left Alliance  [SLD] Deputy Zbigniew Siemiatkowski, will present the Sejm with  three proposed amendments.    The first one concerns the holding of a preconstitutional  referendum, proposed in a bill submitted by the Union of Labor  [UP]. As was agreed upon during a previous meeting of the  committee, it would be of an optional character; that is, the  Sejm might, but would not have to, hold such a referendum.    On Friday [11 March], the committee also agreed to give up  the idea of the so-called zero option--that is, the proposal  that the seven draft constitutions submitted in the previous  Sejm be declared invalid. This means that the drafts will be  taken into account.    The committee also accepted the idea, submitted on behalf of  the coalition by SLD Deputy Jerzy Jaskiernia, that the right to  submit a constitutional draft also be granted to a group of  500,000 citizens, if this support is backed up by their  signatures. The period for the submission of these bills would  be three months from the day the law comes into force. In the  cases of well-founded doubts concerning the authenticity of the  signatures, the Constitutional Committee of the National  Assembly could request that the State Electoral Committee verify  them on the basis of appropriate regulations of the Sejm  Election Law.    A counterproposal was put forward by Krzysztof Kaminski  (Confederation for an Independent Poland--KPN). He suggested  that the right to submit a draft constitution be granted to a  group of 100,000 citizens.    The issue of the citizens' constitutional initiative stirred  up the most controversy during the Friday session. UP Deputy  Janusz Szymanski and KPN Deputy Krzysztof Kaminski expressed  their doubts about whether the committee can debate this motion  because it is clearly an extension of the matter included in the  amendment bills (prepared by the KPN and UP) the Sejm forwarded  to the Constitutional Committee. It was claimed that this  motion should be the subject of a separate legislative  initiative; it was at the same time recalled that the Sejm  recently rejected similar proposals submitted by the president.  However, in the ballot that followed, the committee did not  share these objections.    During the discussion, the bill was also criticized for  something else: It was claimed that drafting a constitution in  three months' time and collecting 500,000 signatures is next to  impossible.    Deputy Jaskiernia polemized with this view; he claimed that,  in practice, this period will be longer and that many groupings  have already prepared or almost prepared their drafts. Setting  a more remote deadline would excessively prolong work on the  Constitution, which has lasted too long already, and would be  dangerous. The explanation of the figure of 500,000 was the  following: The right to submit a Constitution draft is exercised  by, among others, 56 members of the National Assembly, who  represent 1.2 million voters. Granting the right to the  initiative to 100,000 citizens would mean unjustified privileges  for the electorate of extraparliamentary groups.    According to Deputy Jaskiernia, the coalition has launched  this initiative because, especially in a situation when the  right wing refuses to cooperate in the creation of a  Constitution, it wants to avoid the accusation that "the  parliament members that are dealing with this fail to notice the  citizens." Serving this purpose is the invitation of the  representatives of the extraparliamentary parties to the work in  the Constitutional Committee, abandoning the zero option, the  possibility of holding a preconstitutional referendum, the  constitutional citizens' initiative, and a confirming referendum.</p>

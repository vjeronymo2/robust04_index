			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> INGLEWOOD OFFERS TEACHERS FUNDS TO CUT ABSENTEEISM  </P> <P> In an attempt to break an impasse in contract talks, negotiators for the  Inglewood Unified School District this week offered to give teachers half the  money the district would save if teachers reduce their absenteeism.  </P> <P> The district has allocated about $1 million for substitute teachers this  academic year but expects to actually spend almost twice that amount, according  to Lester Jones, the district's chief negotiator.  </P> <P> The Substitute Teacher Reduction Partnership Agreement would split any savings  for next year between year-end bonuses for teachers and school improvements.  </P> <P> "This is truly a 'win-win' opportunity for the entire district," Jones said in  a statement.  </P> <P> Inglewood Teachers Assn. President Cheryl Bell, however, called the latest  district offer "no big deal" and said the two sides are still far apart. The  teachers have authorized a strike if no resolution comes soon.  </P></p>

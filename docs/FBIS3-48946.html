This explains why the SDL has proposed early  elections, he says.    To avoid the crisis in which it had found itself, the  Movement For a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) formed a coalition  with the Slovak National Party (SNS). Because its 75 votes are  exactly half the parliament's total number of seats, the vote of  no confidence in it cannot be made. However, since it is one  vote short of a majority, it lacks leverage for pushing through  certain issues, Kanis says, adding that he believes that the  process of differentiation within the HZDS is something latent  and hidden which it might be possible for all to see if members  of the HZDS group of deputies show the necessary courage. If  they fail to take initiative, the process might be sparked off  by the worsening political and economic situation in Slovakia.  Some deputies from the most deeply struck regions may come  under pressure from their voters and distance themselves from  the government, Kanis says in SLOVENSKY DENNIK.</p>

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Putting on the Ritz: A US presence in the UK video rental business The takeover of Cityvision of the UK by Florida-based Blockbuster looks, on the face of it, like good news for the 15.6m British households which own video cassette recorders. Blockbuster, the leading US video rental chain, boasts of a wider selection, longer opening hours and more sophisticated computer systems than its competitors. It says it will use the expertise gathered in expanding from a couple of dozen outlets five years ago to more than 2,000 today to transform Cityvision's Ritz chain, the largest in the UK. The Blockbuster takeover was opposed, however, by dissident Cityvision shareholders who claimed that the Pounds 75m takeover, launched last November, undervalued the company. The objectors were defeated last Thursday when Blockbuster said it held 50.21 per cent of Cityvision's shares. Other questions can be raised about the Blockbuster takeover. One is that it is buying into a declining sector. After growing from Pounds 50m in 1981 to Pounds 569m in 1989, the video rental market in the UK fell to Pounds 564m in 1990 and Pounds 544m last year. At the same time, the value of video tapes sold in the UK has increased steadily from Pounds 15m in 1986 to Pounds 375m last year. An additional question relates to Blockbuster itself. To describe the company as controversial is an understatement. For much of its six-year history, its shares have oscillated widely. Over the past 12 months, they have been as high as Dollars 15 1/8 , as low at Dollars 7 7/8 , and now stand at about Dollars 13. Blockbuster seems to have all the trappings of a success story. Until the mid-1980s, it was called Cook Data Services and provided software services to the oil and gas industry. In 1985, faced with the energy industry slump, the company switched to video rental. In early 1987, Mr Wayne Huizenga became chairman and chief executive, positions he still holds, along with a near-12 per cent stake. Blockbuster's rapid growth followed Mr Huizenga's arrival. Even before the Cityvision deal, the company's geographical spread was considerable, with outlets in Puerto Rico, Canada, Guam and the UK. Spurred by this heady expansion, after-tax profits have soared from Dollars 3.2m in 1987 to Dollars 93.7m in 1991. Earnings per share have more than quadrupled over four years, to reach 56 cents in the last 12 months. So what is the problem? The first is Mr Huizenga himself. The stocky businessman, in his early 50s and of Dutch descent, is better-known as a co-founder of Waste Management, a large US waste disposal group. Despite its number one industry ranking, Waste Management's 23-year-history has been a chequered one. It has paid fines after charges of price-fixing. In 1976, Huizenga signed a consent decree (without admitting guilt) on charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission that the company made improper political contributions in Florida. A rather different concern has centred on Blockbuster and the quality of its profits, in particular whether its depreciation charges are too low. In the company's accounts, the videocassette rental stock is recorded at cost, and then written off over its economic life. The faster the write-off, the higher the amortisation charge, and the bigger the dent in profits. In its early days, Blockbuster generally wrote its stock off over three years. This sparked criticism from analysts that the stock should be written off more quickly. So, from 1990 onwards, the company switched to writing off a certain number of 'hits' - new release feature film videos, bought in large numbers - over 12 months. Some critics are still not satisfied, and would like an even more conservative stance. The figures are material; in 1990, for example, the amortisation charge for the rental stock was Dollars 91.7m. The third question is whether the group is basically driven by expansion alone, or whether it is an effective retailer. Blockbuster's supporters argue that there has been a good deal of progress on the latter score lately, partly thanks to the arrival of Mr Joseph Baczko, a former head of Toys R Us International, as chief operating officer a year ago. Mr Norman Abbott, director general of the British Videogram Association, says there is plenty of scope for Blockbuster to improve the management of the UK rental industry. He estimates that the UK has 6,000 to 7,000 outlets dedicated wholly to video rental, in addition to the many newsagents and other retailers who rent out tapes as a sideline. Although some video stores are well run, many are not. 'There are still a lot of amateurs in video rental. People came into the business in the early days with no experience of retailing - redundant lorry drivers, redundant steelworkers, redundant white collar executives,' he says. Although Mr Abbott excludes the Ritz chain from his criticisms, Cityvision's dissident shareholders charged that the Ritz shops were so badly staffed that they had to close during peak hours to allow the manager to use the toilet or to catch up on paperwork. The dissidents also produced photographs of video shops owned by Cityvision which still carried the logo of the previous owner, despite having been bought many months earlier. Mr Abbott says video rental has been hit by the recession, but he believes the arrival of satellite television has eaten into the market as well. He does not believe the sale of pre-recorded videos - what the industry calls 'sell-through' - affects the rental business directly. Many of the tapes sold are cookery or fitness cassettes or are bought as gifts. But the sellers of videos - retailers such as Woolworths and WH Smith - do advertise their products, something which the rental industry has failed to do. Mr Steven Berrard, Blockbuster's vice-chairman and chief financial officer, says an increase in advertising will be one of the US company's priorities in the UK. 'The thing to do first is energise the industry a bit. Part of the problem with the rental industry in the UK is that it lacks oxygen.' He plans to widen the range of films available in Ritz outlets and get rid of the titles which are not being rented. Mr Berrard does not deny that the UK rental market has been damaged by satellite television. 'The numbers probably speak for themselves. The recession and competition have hit the business. The operators have cut back on what they buy and the customers have become even more frustrated. I think we have to turn that round a little bit. To rent a video is still the cheapest form of entertainment.'</p>

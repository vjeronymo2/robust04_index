			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Coptic Pope Shanudah by Sana' al-Sa'id in </F> Cairo; date not given]    [Excerpts] [Al-Sa'id] There has been a lot of talk in Cairo  about an upcoming conference on minorities in the Middle East.  This conference considers Egypt's Copts a religious minority.  How do you feel about that?    [Shanudah] We are Egyptians and a part of the Egyptian  people. We are not a minority in Egypt. We do not like to  consider ourselves a minority and do not like others to call us  a minority. The terms minority and majority indicate segregation  and discrimination. This does not befit the sons of a single  homeland, especially if this homeland is beloved Egypt. If the  reason for the use of the terms minority and majority is the  difference in religion, the tolerance of religion--any  religion--does not permit this discrimination. We are all the  descendants of one father, Adam, and one mother, Eve.    If the Copts have some problems or demands, these matters  can  be solved in a spirit of amity in the same homeland without the  use of the terms minority and majority. These matters can be  solved without psychological sensitivities. The attempts, even  if they are well meaning, by some to defend the Copts does not  necessarily require them to call us a minority.    [Al-Sa'id] Can it be said that under the new world order the  attempts to stir up religions chauvinism and deepen the struggle  among the parties have increased? Israel exploited this  situation when it warned against the so-called Islamic  fundamentalism in an attempt to win the sympathy of the West.    [Shanudah] I believe that states are motivated by interests  and not religion. The proof is that during World War II the  allies joined with communist Russia against Hitler. It was a  temporary alliance. Each state is motivated by its interests  and not by religion. If religion enters into the picture, it is  marginal, not basic, and its use is temporary. For example, the  United States now supports the Jews although it differs in  religion with Israel. The whole issue is one of interests.    [Al-Sa'id] But Israel has always concentrated on using  religion and on appearing as a religious state.    [Shanudah] In Israel proper religion is part of the state's  mechanism. Israel is a state with a Jewish religious character.  Jews did not cooperate with non-Jews in old times. The  religious aspect is a basic one in Israel. Israel has both  political and religious aims.    [Al-Sa'id] This illustrates Israel's racism and double  standards in differentiating between its treatment of the Jewish  settlers and the Palestinians.    [Shanudah] Naturally, Israel combines religion with racism.  Israel's policy contains both elements. The Israelis call  themselves "God's people." This expression is religious and has  religious connotations. For example, the desire to rebuild the  temple is a religious desire. In Israel both racism and  religion are permanent fixtures. However, this does not apply  to other states. [passage omitted]    [Al-Sa'id] What is your opinion of U.S. President Bill  Clinton's statement on Jerusalem as the united capital of Israel  and that it is not part of the occupied Arab territories?    [Shanudah] Israel views Jerusalem as an essential issue. The  United States should not have gone to this extent to appease  Israel. It should not have made such a statement. The U.S.  Administration retracted the statement later. It perhaps  realized that it should not have gone this far, that it has hurt  all the Arab countries, and that it has disregarded the feelings  of the Muslims all over the world. For this reason, Clinton  corrected the mistake and said that the issue of Jerusalem will  be discussed in the political dialogue. [passage omitted]    [Al-Sa'id] While Israel has been trying to deepen Jewish  religious chauvinism, it has tried to accuse the neighboring  countries of extremism and terrorism. Isn't this considered a  kind of ideological conflict?    [Shanudah] Israel is the last country in the world that can  accuse others of extremism and terrorism because the description  applies to it. The al-Ibrahimi Mosque incident in Hebron is the  best proof. Wasn't this an ugly terrorist operation? [passage  omitted] Israel has no right to criticize or accuse others  while it is involved in terrorism.    [Al-Sa'id] Regarding the existence of religious parties in  Israel, there are some who think that the issue of whether we  need religious parties or not should be raised in the national  dialogue that is expected to be held this month. Some also  think that a religious party, after it is established, cannot  pull the carpet from under the religious extremists.    [Shanudah] Who said that the Israeli Government can coexist  with the religious parties?    [Al-Sa'id] The parties constitute a pressuring factor and  the government is afraid of them and seeks to win their support.    [Shanudah] The fact that the government seeks to win the  support of the religious parties to ensure a majority in  parliament does not mean that it welcomes them. On the  contrary, if there were no religious parties the votes would go  to the ruling party. We must not find controversial things in  other states to emulate them. The existence of one religious  party in Egypt will open the door to the formation of many other  religious parties because there is no single religious ideology.  As Christians we do not approve of this. There is no single  religious ideology among the Muslims, and this could create  conflicts.    [Al-Sa'id] This means that there is no reason to raise the  issue of religious parties?    [Shanudah] In my opinion, if the Islamic trend is allowed to  rule, more than one party will surface and these parties will be  fighting each other. As it is now, there is a conflict among  the various religious groups and each one labels the other  atheist.    [Al-Sa'id] What about the Christians?    [Shanudah] We do not accept the establishment of religious  parties. We do not accept the existence of a Christian  religious party. It is not in our interest or in the interest  of the state. [passage omitted]    [Al-Sa'id] How can terrorism and violence be stopped?  Shall a terrorist be regarded as a sick person who must be  treated and reformed or a renegade who must be fought and  eliminated?    [Shanudah] First of all, wide-scale enlightenment is an  important matter. By enlightenment we mean answering the ideas  used by terrorists to convince others to join them. Moderate  thought and extremist thought must not run in two parallel lines  that never meet. We must study their ideas and answer them.  [passage omitted]    [Al-Sa'id] Can dialogue be held with blood-thirsty  terrorists?    [Shanudah] If it is not possible to hold a dialogue with  them, then we must hold dialogue with their ideas. We might not  be able to hold a dialogue with a certain person because he  might be in jail or in hiding. However, we can hold a dialogue  with his ideas. This is one point. Another point is that we  must eliminate those who support terrorism using their ideas,  arms, and training. Some people encourage terrorism with their  ideas, others with arms, and others by providing training. We  must confront these three kinds of people who mostly come from  abroad. [passage omitted]    [Al-Sa'id] Can we depend on the security services alone?    [Shanudah] The security aspect alone is not enough. Emphasis  on it may prolong the battle. An ideological and precautionary  approach may preclude new conflicts between the security  services and the terrorists.    [Al-Sa'id] Is it difficult for someone to argue with  extremist thought and closed mentalities that stick to their  ideas?    [Shanudah] It is not a difficult process. It is possible to  get rid of old ideas by discussing new ones. It is possible for  a person to believe in ideas, including religious ideas,  different from his own ideas by discussing them with others.  There are those who believe in certain ideas and then abandon  them as a result of religious discussions. I discuss ideas and  do not refer to persons. [passage omitted]    [Al-Sa'id] In your opinion, what has caused this attack on  religion? Who has encouraged attacks on religion at this  particular time?    [Shanudah] Freedom of thought has been exploited beyond its  boundaries. We are in an age in which freedom can be used  incorrectly to attack old religious values. [passage omitted]    [Al-Sa'id] Can the phenomenon of attacks on religion be a  result of negligence by religious scholars?    [Shanudah] The phenomenon of attacks on religion is part of  a general atmosphere. Just as there are attacks on religion,  there are also attacks on law, politicians, family, and  principles and ideals. [passage omitted]</p>

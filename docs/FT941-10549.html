			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Agents and Names claim success Both loss-making Gooda Walker Names and the Lloyd's agents they are suing took a positive view yesterday about the outcome of a High Court hearing on an application to adjourn one of the biggest legal actions at the insurance market. No ruling was given after the hearing, held in chambers rather than in open court. Mr Andrew Pincott, senior partner at Elborne Mitchell, solicitor for the agents, said the 'application for an adjournment has itself been adjourned until February 28. It is still very much a live application.' The Gooda Walker Action Group, which is organising the Names' action due to begin on April 26, said Names 'will not have their case adjourned to next year. (Defending members' agents) did not obtain a change in the date of the trial.'</p>

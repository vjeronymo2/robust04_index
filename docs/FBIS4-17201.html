			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Sitnikov] </F>   [Text] United Nations April 22 TASS -- "Russia calls for a  breakthrough towards the settlement of the bloody Bosnian  conflict, which can be ensured only by perspective and bold  political steps, projected into the future," Russian Permanent  Delegate on the United Nations Yuliy Vorontsov told the U.N.  Security Council in connection with its resolution on Gorazde,  adopted last night.    "Russia is convinced," Vorontsov noted, "that there is no  alternative to the political deblocking of the Bosnian conflict.  In addition to urgent measures, called upon to stop the  military escalation, we need perspective political steps,  projected into the future, which would ensure a breakthrough  towards the settlement of this sanguinary conflict. This is the  purpose of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's initiative,  envisaging a summit meeting of Russia, the United States, the  European Union and the United Nations. It is high time for them  to work out a joint political approach to the solution of the  Bosnian conflict and to make it known to the conflicting sides  so that it would be clear to them that it is necessary to reach  an agreement and not to skip over from one crisis to another,"  the Russian delegate noted.    He pointed out that in the present-day conditions it was  primarily necessary for all the sides to immediately conclude  under the aegis of the U.N. PROFOR [UN Protection Force] an  agreement on a ceasefire in Gorazde and on the entire territory  of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which should be  scrupulously observed. "The Bosnian Serb leadership must assume  a commitment to stop attacks and to withdraw its forces from  Gorazde, to ensure conditions for the deployment of U.N. troops  in that city... At the same time, all provocative actions in  Gorazde and around it, as well as in other safety zones must be  stopped," Vorontsov stressed. He said that the Security Council  "cannot and shall not put up with attempts to undermine the  political process by adventuristic and provocative actions, no  matter who is behind them."    The Russian representative drew attention to the concern  expressed in the resolution in connection with the abuse of the  status of safety zones and pointed out that it was necessary to  specify the concept of such areas. He expressed Russia's  readiness to strengthen the safety zones.    Vorontsov stressed that the idea of lifting the embargo on  arms deliveries to the conflict zones "runs counter to the  efforts to achieve an early peace and is apt to add fuel to the  blazing conflict, which is liable to spread to neighbouring  countries".</p>

			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PADDLE TENNIS;  </P> <P> PROPONENTS OF A MISUNDERSTOOD SPORT BATTLE TO IMPROVE THE GAME'S WIMPY IMAGE  WHILE TRYING TO FIND A DECENT PLACE TO PLAY  </P> <P> Jerry Newmark tells a story about a famous Hollywood producer who answered the  question, Is there paddle tennis after death?  </P> <P> The producer's Beverly Hills estate came equipped with a paddle-tennis court.  Every week for years, he played doubles with the same bunch of guys. When he  died, he made sure the game went on without him.  </P> <P> "In his will, he specified that we could play paddle tennis on his court as  long as we wanted," says Newmark, who lives in Tarzana.  </P> <P> Newmark, a 63-year-old former California doubles champion, considers himself  lucky to have friends with private courts. In Los Angeles, if a player lives  outside Venice, finding a convenient public paddle-tennis court is almost  impossible.  </P> <P> Take away the 11 courts at Venice Beach and there are only a handful of public  courts in the entire L.A. area, probably none in your neighborhood. In the  Valley area, the only public courts in good shape are the two at the Racquet  Centre in Studio City. The three courts at North Hollywood High are in  disrepair and the one at Granada Hills Park doesn't have a net. There are no  courts in county parks in the Valley.  </P> <P> Why so few public courts in a town that produces almost all of the great  paddle-tennis players in the world? That's one of the many puzzling questions  about paddle tennis, America's most misunderstood sport. Despite being around  for nearly a century, it has yet to imprint its image into the American  consciousness. If anything, people are more confused than ever.  </P> <P> Ask around at the office and this is what you usually get:  </P> <P> "Paddle tennis? It's like table tennis and paddle ball. I think in the East  they call it deck tennis and play it on a wooden platform."  </P> <P> "They play it in a chicken-wire cage."  </P> <P> "Isn't that the game that old, bald, infirm guys play at the beach?"  </P> <P> Tell them that paddle-tennis is almost exactly like tennis. The rules are about  the same. But the playing surface is only 20 by 50 feet, a little more than a  third the size of a tennis court; the net is only 31 inches high; there are no  walls or chicken wire; hard-birch paddles weighing about 16 ounces can whack a  forehand drive upwards of 90 m.p.h.; and the ball is served underhanded, almost  eliminating faults.  </P> <P> The ball used in paddle tennis also creates a lot of confusion. It is a regular  tennis ball that has been punctured by a hypodermic needle to let the pressure  out (try explaining that at the office). But the deadening effect gives a  player more control of the ball coming off his paddle than a tennis player has  with a lively ball on a string racket. The result is a game that is easier than  tennis to learn and to play well.  </P> <P> Unlike tennis players, paddle-tennis players like to dress down, perhaps  because of the beach's influence on the game. And the strict etiquette that is  required in tennis is almost completely ignored. Sol Hauptman, who has won 14  of the last 15 national doubles titles, is renowned for screaming -- at  teammates -- during matches. Tournaments get nasty -- players have been known  to purposely smash overhands at opponents' torsoes from point-blank range.  </P> <P> At its highest levels, paddle tennis is played at the net, fast and furious,  the players only a few feet apart, cracking volleys at one another with  dizzying speed. Because of the lack of courts, doubles is the preferred game.  Age has little to do with ability. Newmark, at 63, can hold his own in a  friendly game with top players, and he plays regularly with a 76-year-old man.  </P> <P> According to the Culver City-based U. S. Paddle Tennis Assn. -- the sport's  governing body -- only an estimated 200,000 people in the country regularly  play paddle tennis, and half live in the L. A. area. No one is quite sure  whether Americans aren't playing paddle tennis because there are no courts or  there are no courts because Americans aren't playing. But it's evident that the  image problem doesn't help.  </P> <P> "People just don't understand the sport," says Barry Zelner, an attorney and a  highly regarded open-class player.  </P> <P> Like Newmark's Hollywood producer, Zelner has solved the court-shortage problem  by building one in his Tarzana back yard. And like most dyed-in-the-wool  players, he's passionate, almost evangelical, about the game. "It just amazes  me that more people don't play," he says.  </P> <P> A former tennis teaching pro, Zelner didn't play paddle tennis until he entered  a tournament at the Racquet Center about eight years ago. He and his partner  used a pair of ancient Marcraft PT-90 paddles, circa 1950. Somehow, they came  in third and "I haven't hardly played tennis since," says Zelner, who teamed  with Newmark to win the California A-class title in 1984.  </P> <P> On a recent evening, a bright yellow glow spills over the palm trees in his  neighborhood as Zelner bangs paddle-tennis balls on his lighted court. He is  playing with Newmark, '89 U. S. doubles runner-up Lance Tepper, and a man so  far in over his head that he prefers not to be identified. The game is doubles,  which Tepper considers "three times as fast as singles and more fun."  </P> <P> The games on Zelner's court get combative but never sink to the level of  competitiveness found in tournaments. In the 90-minute, sweat-inducing workout,  Tepper and Zelner, both of whom can launch rockets off their paddles,  graciously hit balls slow enough to be returned, and Newmark doesn't direct as  many volleys at the feet of the inexperienced player as he could. Tepper lets  it slip that "we were going about one-quarter speed."  </P> <P> Inside Zelner's Southwest-influenced house, they sit around talking about  paddle tennis. With them are Zelner's wife, Lori; their son, Brian, an  8-year-old who hits a mean forehand; and Shasta, a golden retriever who fetches  errant shots during games.  </P> <P> Lori also plays paddle tennis, preferring singles. When she drives around the  Valley, she says, she always notices paddle-tennis courts in back yards and one  day wants to organize their owners into a Valley league. An advocate of the  sport, she comes to its defense if she hears anyone disparage it.  </P> <P> "Barry's uncle has a tennis court in his back yard and he's always putting down  paddle tennis, calling it 'walking Ping-Pong,' " Lori says. "He thinks it's so  easy. 'Give me a chance at you,' I tell him. 'You'll find out.' "  </P></p>

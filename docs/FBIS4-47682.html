			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Election '94" program] </F>   [Text] The Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] has  confirmed that the target time for the completion of  vote-counting is midnight tonight, with a few exceptions. This  was announced by the chief director of election administration,  Mr. Piet Colyn, at a news conference a short while ago. Mr.  Colyn said the final provisional count would be made known by  early tomorrow morning. He said good progress was being made  and minor problems were being ironed out.    [Begin Colyn recording] By 5 o'clock this afternoon a high  percentage of the counting will be completed. We have  experienced problems with the counting, especially in two areas.  The one area is where we have a voting venue comprising various  voting stations. To give you examples: the one at Nasrec  [National Exhibition Center], Pretoria show grounds, the  exhibition center in Durban. These are well in progress now and  those results will start coming in. The other area is the  outlying parts of the country where you have tremendous  logistical problems to do with counting. I'm confident that the  counting of votes will more or less be completed by midnight  tonight. We get positive reports from all over the country.    As far as Northern Transvaal is concerned, problems  experienced there, I'm quite sure, they have been resolved now.  We have sent in expert teams to assist it. And today we can  specialize on those kinds of problems that we still experience  and identify the particular individual voting station still  experiencing problems, and send in teams to assist with the  counting in those stations.

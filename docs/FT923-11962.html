			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Letter: Adam and Eve and others Sir, As a devoted reader of the last item in your Observer column, may I point out that the three protagonists featured in 'At the core' (July 20) all have the facts completely wrong. The Englishman and the Frenchman seem to believe that it was Adam who offered the apple to Eve, when we all know on the best authority (Genesis, 3) that it was the other way round. And far from having nothing but an apple to eat, as the Russian asserts, they could eat the fruit of all the trees in the Garden of Eden, except that from the tree of knowledge of good and evil and the tree of eternal life.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yelena Kotelnikova: "Brakov Gives an Ultimatum </F> to the Authorities"]    [Text] The management of the Moscow joint-stock  company "Plant imeni I.A. Likhachev" (AMO ZIL) has demanded that  the president and the government "find an opportunity" for  financing the enterprise annually (up to 1998); otherwise the  enterprise faces the threat of "a social explosion." The  question of financial support for the privatized enterprise is  to be examined today at a meeting of the government's Committee  on Strategic Matters under the chairmanship of First Vice  Premier Oleg Soskovets. It is clear that concession to pressure  from the ZIL administration will be a signal for a frontal  assault on the budget by those directors who are not prepared to  accept the market rules of the game.    The AMO ZIL (about 3 billion rubles [R] of charter  capital), which manufactures trucks, as well as refrigerators  and microwave ovens, was privatized in accordance with the first  version of benefits, as a result of which 40 percent of its  shares were acquired by the enterprise's employees (25 percent  of them are preferred shares). After the checking privatization,  the largest blocks of stock (about 20 percent of each) were  concentrated in the ZIL administration and the "Mikrodin"  Trading Firm. A block of similar size was reserved for  investments and is under the jurisdiction of the privatization  organs.    According to Vladimir Nosov, the ZIL chief engineer, the  plant assembles 180 trucks per day at a price of about R14  million each, and it needs state support so much that the  enterprise's managers "stand watch at the telephone so that they  do not miss a call from the government." At the same time,  Yevgeniy Brakov, the "president and general director,"  personally is looking over the lists of those invited to the  stockholders meeting which opens today in Luzhniki (the AMO ZIL  has about 180,000 stockholders); a call from the government and  the stockholders meeting may bring a fundamental change to the  ZIL director's position. The productivity of the enterprise's  principal output has dropped by 80 percent over the year and the  number of industrial personnel has been cut back by 14,000  (about 15 percent of those employed). Brakov himself links the  slump with "the government's poorly planned domestic policy." It  follows from this that President Boris Yeltsin and First Vice  Premier Oleg Soskovets are in debt to the ZIL. Letters of  ultimatum are being sent regularly to the Kremlin and the White  House (Soskovets received the last one on 18 April) with the  demand that "funds be found" to add to ZIL's working capital and  for budgetary financing of its investment programs (over R100  billion annually up to 1998). In addition, Brakov is insisting  on tax holidays for the enterprise, as well as the introduction  of a favorable investment exchange rate for the ruble against  foreign currencies to pay for contracts. At the same time, the  ZIL board of directors is not concealing the fact that the  enterprise already has "a large debt to the budget and nonbudget  funds" (from his February letter to President Yeltsin). However,  the main obstacle to further subsidized financing of the  enterprise by the state, in the opinion of the enterprise  management, is "the connivance" of vice premiers Aleksandr  Shokhin and Anatoliy Chubays "to abolish the domestic automotive  industry and open a market for imported equipment" (from  Brakov's April letter to Soskovets).    Indeed, in Chubays' department, which oversees the  management  of state proportions in the privatized sector of industry, they  do not consider the ZIL claims to be justified, since they  consider the reason for the crisis at the enterprise to be  primarily "the inability of the enterprise's managers, who are  accustomed to working 'under the government's tutelage,' to  adapt to market conditions." In particular, Alfred Kokh, deputy  chairman of the GKI [State Committee on the Administration of  State Property], reported that the enterprise's capacities are  designed for 200,000 trucks. In his words, however, the  management "deliberately cut back" output to 34,000 vehicles,  since it was "not in a position to restructure the system of  product sales based on such a large batch of trucks (no less  than 100 units)." The GKI believes it is precisely the  enterprise management's policy which is adding to the  unemployment. In this connection, the GKI plan for the ZIL's  financial normalization is based on utilization of the  enterprise's internal reserves and retention of the existing  ownership structure. This differs not only from the plant  management's proposals, which are totally oriented toward state  support, but the plan of Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov, who is  demanding 20 percent of the enterprise's stock in exchange for  helping it.  <H5>  Basic Proposals for Financial Normalization of the ZIL: </H5>   --Pesident and General Director Yevgeniy Brakov:  to provide for budget financing of the enterprise's  investment programs until 1999 and to introduce tax holidays for  the ZIL, as well as a favorable exchange rate against foreign  currencies to pay for contracts    --The State Committee on the Administration of State  Property: to introduce outside management of the  enterprise, to add to its working capital through the sale  of administration buildings (the plant management, in  particular), and to form a dealer network    --Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov: to lease land to the  ZIL for 49 years for mortgage operations in exchange  for 20 percent of the enterprise's stock; to defer payment  to the city budget until the end of 1994 (about R63 billion).</p>

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Flaws in the Elf takeover theory  -A strategic stake in Petrofina PETROFINA, the Belgian oil and gas company, yesterday confirmed that Elf Aquitaine, the French state-controlled oil company, had built up a 4.9 per cent stake in the group. Elf's undeclared presence on the Petrofina share register has fuelled intense speculation about a possible bid for Belgium's largest industrial company, which would rival the controversial struggle for control of Societe Generale de Belgique, Belgium's largest holding company, in the late 1980s. Petrofina's share price, which rose slightly to BFr8,790 yesterday, has come down from its peak of BFr11,750 a year ago, making the stock a more attractive target for predators. Shareholders are due to vote today on a series of proposed defensive measures, one of which would have forced Elf out into the open anyway, by obliging investors to declare stakes of more than 3 per cent. Meanwhile, La Generale, which controls an 11.33 per cent stake in the oil company, is searching for ways of reducing its industrial exposure. But in the last few days oil has been poured on these troubled waters. On Friday, Mr Gerard Worms, chairman of Compagnie de Suez, La Generale's French majority shareholder, said it was 'highly unlikely' the Belgian holding company would sell its Petrofina stake. If it did, Petrofina's chairman, Mr Albert Frere, who controls some 28 per cent of the group through Groupe Bruxelles Lambert and other holding companies, would have first refusal. Given Mr Frere's predilection for shuffling his holdings, this may not be as sure a guarantee of future stability as Petrofina would like the speculators to believe. But it is true that the typically Belgian network of agreements between existing shareholders might deter outside predators. A more important flaw in the Elf takeover theory is that Petrofina would not fit into the French company's strategy. The activities of the two groups are complementary - Elf is strong in exploration and production, while Petrofina is more heavily committed to refining. But Elf would almost certainly have trouble digesting Petrofina. A more likely option is a strategic alliance between the two. Strapped for cash and carrying debt of some BFr100bn (Dollars 3.02bn), Petrofina is trying to cut operational costs by BFr3bn this year and raise between BFr5bn and BFr8bn annually from asset sales - meaning strategic partnership rather than outright disposals. For Petrofina shareholders, such alliances could be their only consolation over the next two years. Consolidated profits in 1992 fell by 72 per cent, from BFr16.3bn to BFr4.6bn, as low crude prices, pressure on refining margins, overcapacity in the petrochemicals sector and an adverse dollar-franc exchange rate all took their toll. The dividend was halved - the first cut since 1959. Moreover, the company is having to take swift and expensive action to upgrade the ageing Ekofisk oil installations in the North Sea. This year, a 7 or 8 per cent increase in oil production is probably the best that investors have to look forward to. The exploration budget - BFr10bn two years ago - is being cut to less than BFr3bn this year, and some of the work is being farmed out to new partners. Downstream, the group has reined in its US and European ambitions for a wide network of Fina service stations, to concentrate on areas which can be easily and cheaply supplied from existing pipelines and refineries, such as northern France and Germany, or Texas and Louisiana. The company's real hopes, however, are pinned on its BFr29bn investment in the Antwerp refinery, which should allow it to add more value to its oil products, while cutting sulphur emissions and content to levels much stricter than required by European environmental regulations. The good news is that the project is on schedule to come on stream at the end of 1994. The bad news is that its benefits will not show through in the accounts until 1995. Under the circumstances, analysts are surprised that the share price has remained so buoyant for so long, but the speculation may continue. Even Friday's calming statement from Suez prompted a small surge in the share price, based on the fact that Elf would be interested in the La Generale stake if it were sold. For the future, there are new rumours about shadowy Elf 'allies', holding stakes of less than 3 per cent and ready to support the French company should it seek to parley with Mr Frere.</p>

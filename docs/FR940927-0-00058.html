			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By letter dated March 7, 1994, Utah submitted a proposed amendment to its program and plan pursuant to SMCRA (administrative record No. UT&hyph;900). Utah submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative. The program provisions of the Utah Coal Mining and Reclamation Act that Utah proposed to revise were Utah Code Annotated (UCA) 40&hyph;10&hyph;14, appeals to district court of decisions by the Board of Oil, Gas and Mining (Board) and further review, and UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20, civil and criminal penalties. The plan provisions of the Utah Coal Mining and Reclamation Act that Utah proposed to revise were UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28, recovery of reclamation costs and liens against reclaimed land, and UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28.1, certification of completion of coal reclamation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the March 29, 1994,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 14591), OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment, provided an opportunity for a public hearing or meeting on its substantive adequacy, and invited public comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. UT&hyph;911). Because no one requested a public hearing or meeting, none was held. The public comment period ended on April 28, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns relating to the provsions of the Utah Coal Mining and Reclamation Act at UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;14 (3) and (6), procedural guidance for formal hearings and appeals of decisions by the Board and district court decisions; UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(3), waiver of rights to contest the violation or amount of a civil penalty if the operator fails to forward the amount of the penalty within the time allowed; UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(8), review proceedings of a civil penalty assessed for failure to correct a violation; and UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28 (1)(a)(ii) and (2)(a), sale price of reclaimed abandoned mine land and waiver of liens when certain criteria are met. OSM notified Utah of the concerns by letter dated June 10, 1994 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;935). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For each of the issues identified by OSM, Utah responded in a letter dated July 5, 1994, by submitting additional explanatory information (administrative record No. UT&hyph;949). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon the additional explanatory information for the proposed program and plan amendment submitted by Utah, OSM reopened the public comment period in the July 29, 1994,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 38579, administrative record No. UT&hyph;955). The public comment period ended on August 15, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Director's Findings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed below, the Director, in accordance with SMCRA and 30 CFR 732.15, 732.17, 884.15(a), and 884.14 finds, with certain exceptions and additional requirements, that the proposed program and plan amendment submitted by Utah on March 7, 1994, and supplemented with additional explanatory information on July 5, 1994, is no less stringent than SMCRA. Accordingly, the Director approves the proposed amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Nonsubstantive Revisions to Utah's Statutes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Utah proposed revisions to the following previously-approved provisions of the Utah Coal Mining and Reclamation Act that are nonsubstantive in nature and consist of minor editorial, punctuation, grammatical, and recodification changes (the corresponding SMCRA provisions are listed in parentheses): <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(1) (b) and (c) (section 518(a) of SMCRA), civil penalty for violation of Chapter 10, Title 40, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(3) (b), (c), and (d) (section 518(b) of SMCRA), public hearings, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20 (5) and (6) (sections 518 (e) and (f) of SMCRA), criminal penalties, and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28 (1), (1)(a)(i), (1)(b)(ii), and (iii) (sections 407 and 408 of SMCRA), recovery of reclamation costs and liens against reclaimed land. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Algerian military sets up ruling body: Defence minister likely to play central role A BROAD-BASED committee has been handed power in Algeria by the military-dominated council which took control at the weekend after the resignation of President Chadli Bendjedid. The new five-man committee of state has been given a mandate to rule until December 1993. It is headed by Mr Mohamed Boudiaf, a former opponent of President Chadli, but includes Khaled Nezzar, the defence minister, one of three generals on the previous council. The new body, effectively a collegiate presidency, sidesteps the legal ruling that an acting in in president must call a new presidential election within 45 days Mr Chadli is widely believed to have been forced out by the military which was alarmed at his desire to go ahead with the the second round of general elections, scheduled for tomorrow, in which the Moslem fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win parliamentary power. The FIS has pledged to make the north African country an Islamic state. Gen Nezzar's presence on the new council indicates that the army intends to continue a prominent role in running the country. Other members are Mr Ali Haroun, the human rights minister, Dr Tidjani Haddam, rector of the Paris mosque and considered a moderate, and Mr Ali Kafi, president of the Veterans' National Organisation. There was no mention of Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozali, the prime minister, who headed the previous ruling council. Mr Boudiaf, 72, head of the council, has not lived in Algeria since 1963, one year after independence, and currently resides in Morocco. In 1964 he was condemned to death in absentia by President Ahmed Ben Bella for setting up the Party of the Socialist Revolution. Ben Bella was ousted in 1965 but Mr Boudiaf continued to live in exile, opposing the new president, Houari Boumedienne. The present crisis erupted after the FIS won an unexpected landslide in a first round of voting on December 26 and needed just 28 of the remaining seats at stake to take a majority in the new five-year parliament. Gen Nezzar, 54, is seen as the military strongman after having effectively run Algeria twice during states of siege imposed by Mr Chadli in 1988 and last June after the street battles between FIS militants and security forces. Gen Nezzar, a veteran of the independence war with France, was named Algeria's first defence minister in 25 years in July 1990. Mr Kafi, 64, also a veteran of the independence war, spent 22 years as a diplomat. Dr Haddam is a medical doctor. He set up a body to promote family planning in Algeria, before going to Paris. The US yesterday shifted position on Algeria, saying it would not take sides. Earlier the State Department had defended the military-dominated council which took power as provided for by the constitution. The formation of the council was seen as a unifying gesture.</p>

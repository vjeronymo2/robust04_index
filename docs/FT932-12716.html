			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / UK Company News: BTR reveals higher earnings bands THE SALARY of Mr Alan Jackson, chief executive of BTR, is not revealed in the industrial conglomerate's annual report because his duties are considered by the company to be discharged mainly outside the UK. In fact, Mr Jackson earned between Pounds 460,001-Pounds 465,000 last year - not the figure of Pounds 272,590 reported in the Financial Times last week. The lower figure was that of BTR's highest paid UK-based director, which an adviser to the company wrongly identified as being the chief executive. BTR has now revealed the higher earnings bands of three directors which were not published in the annual report - Mr Jackson, a director who earned Pounds 365,001-Pounds 380,000, and another who earned Pounds 410,001-Pounds 415,000. Mr Graeme Pearson, who joined BTR's main board on November 25, earned Pounds 20,001-Pounds 25,000 for his work to December 31. Mr Jackson's salary increased by 5 per cent last year, a period which saw group profits increase 18 per cent to more than Pounds 1bn. His salary is not regarded in the City as excessive, given the company's performance. Mr Stanley Williams, BTR's company secretary, said: 'We are proud of the basis on which our executives are rewarded.' BTR declined to comment on whether Mr Jackson, an Australian, was resident in the UK for tax purposes. Under Inland Revenue rules, anyone who spends 183 days or more in the UK per annum is resident - whether or not the person is a UK citizen. Mr Williams said the salaries of these executives had not been in the annual report because of the terms of the 1985 Companies Act, which requires only the salary of the chairman and UK executives be published. The act also states that this information 'need not be given in respect of a director who discharged his duties as such wholly or mainly outside the UK.' Analysts and institutional investors in BTR were surprised to learn that Mr Jackson came into this category, although more than 60 per cent of BTR's sales and profits come from outside the UK. Mr Jackson, 57, moved to the UK in 1991 when he became group chief executive, after having been managing director of BTR Nylex, the UK group's Australian subsidiary. He is still chairman of BTR Nylex and in 1991 was appointed a director of the Australian Reserve Bank. BTR's reputation for restraint was burnished when Sir Owen Green, the group's retiring chairman, received a pay increase of just Pounds 804 to Pounds 217,616 - a rise of 0.37 per cent. One analyst said: 'You can understand why the Companies Act was drawn up in the way it was, but there's really no reason why we should not know the salaries of all directors of UK companies.'</p>

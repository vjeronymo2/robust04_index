			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / How To Spend It: Why minimalism can be a tyranny - War and Peace (Chintz versus Zen) David Chipperfield is an architect who is possibly most famous for his association with the Equipment shops (for those who do not know them, they are the brainchild of a Frenchman, Christian Restoin, who has built a business on a single garment - the perfect shirt). His sensitive and sympathetic settings tune in perfectly with the sense of timeless quality which Restoin wished to convey. In his earlier years he was deemed to be part of a group of minimalistically inclined architects such as John Pawson, Kenneth Armstrong, and Eva Jiricna. These days he is associated with a 'school of rigour' - that is, with those who believe in precise, rigorous work lacking the bravura and exuberance of the post-modernists. It is the greatest possible compliment that he is much sought-after in Japan for his serene and confident approach to the complex problems that modern retailing must address as well his Tak Building in Kyoto and the Gotoh Museum in Tokyo. 'I wouldn't describe myself as a minimalist, for minimalism suggests a stylistic approach which I am not fundamentally very interested in. What I am interested in is designing with a certain authenticity. 'For instance the decorative approach is often used to suggest a richness and a depth of culture which is often not there and it is the falseness that I do not like. But equally minimalism implies a Zen-like austerity which is often just as false. The stuff is there all right, it's just hidden away in cupboards. 'I don't mind anything which people genuinely value. I wish they would ask themselves why they feel they must have pelmets or frills or curtains - often it is simply because they feel they must, they have not really bothered to work out why. If people truly value them and have real preferences then they are valid. 'I like houses that are a true reflection of the people who live there - books that are there to be read, objects that they have chosen and really like, displays that relate to someone's life and characters. 'I've got friends with amazingly cluttered houses and I love their houses because it's all about them. 'It's when people wrap up their homes with suggestions of things which they haven't really thought about or don't relate to them that I find it . . . well, tasteless. 'I also don't like the industrialisation, the mass-production of the decorator-look turning into a marketable consumer commodity, making it a this or that year fashion because I believe it takes away from people their sense of who they are. 'I don't like what I call symbolic taste - for instance the sort of hotels that go in for acres of stuff and fluffy things and a riding print on the wall because this is what they think a room should look like. It is difficult to get people to disentangle their real attitudes from cliches, for instance, to make them think about what is real comfort as opposed to apparent comfort. 'Japan has been a huge influence on me - the Japanese have a gift for enjoying the essence of things. When the cherry blossom comes out you will find people just sitting under the trees enjoying it. It is the same with bathing which is a simple daily task but they approach it in a ritualistic way, it is important to them and yet it is very simple. 'Personally, I am not convinced by minimalism - it can become a tyranny but if you are going to have less, everything must mean more. I like to make spaces and to create a framework for people's lives. 'I like to give them essentials such as daylight - if you make a window which enjoys a certain view you have brought them closer to nature. What people do with the frame-work after that is up to them.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 5 (KCNA) -- Party and government  officials saw the 18th part of the multi-part feature film "The  Nation and Destiny" on May 4.    The film was seen by Choe Kwang, Kye Ung-tae, Han Song-yong  and other senior party and government officials.    "The Nation and Destiny" Part 18 which was completed as a  masterpiece under the guidance of the party deals with the life  of the heroine Ho Chong-sun who covered an eventful road because  she failed to meet a wise leader after setting out on the  communist movement in the 1920s for the independence of Korea.    The film deeply anatomizes the tragic communist movement in  those days when it was divided into various factions by their  disgusting fighting and vividly proves the truth that only when  the whole nation is united around the wise leader, guided by  him, is it possible to restore the lost country and win victory  in revolution.</p>

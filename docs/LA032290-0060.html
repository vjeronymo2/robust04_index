The 1991 game will be played under Canadian  rules.  </P> <P> Village Christian, a Southern Section Division IX school in the Alpha League,  will play host to St. Mary's of Calgary on Sept. 15 at Kennedy High in a game  played under U. S. rules. The Crusaders are scheduled to play at Calgary under  Canadian rules.  </P> <P> "I figured we had to do something innovative, since everyone else is going to  Hawaii," Crusader Coach Mike Plaisance quipped. Another Alpha League member,  Montclair Prep, is one of four area teams scheduled to open the '90 season in  Hawaii.  </P> <P> Village Christian's contract was arranged through the Southern Section office,  which received an inquiry from St. Mary's, a private school with an enrollment  of 950.  </P></p>

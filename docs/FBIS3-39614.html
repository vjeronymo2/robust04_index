			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Parkin, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>   [Text] Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds today pledged  to take every chance to present a balanced view on the Downing  Street declaration during a visit to the United States next  month.    Speaking ahead of a meeting in London this weekend with John  Major, he again highlighted hopes that their peace initiative  would prompt a permanent end to Northern Ireland-linked  terrorism.    Mr Reynolds told the Irish parliament he was still  "cautiously optimistic" about the success prospects of the  two-month-old joint declaration.    The Irish premier, who meets Mr Major before the two leaders  attend Saturday's Twickenham rugby international between England  and Ireland, said they would be reviewing recent Northern  Ireland political developments. Northern Ireland Secretary Sir  Patrick Mayhew and Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring -- joint  chairmen of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference -- will  also be at the talks.    Mr Reynolds said the meeting would focus primarily on issues  connected with the peace declaration. "We will review progress,  share assessments of the current position and examine approaches  of attaining our common objective of a lasting peace with  justice in Ireland."    He said the advancement of political dialogue through a  resumed inter-party talks process would be discussed too.    Mr Reynolds refused to agree that Sinn Fein's annual  conference at the end of this month would signal the deadline  for its response to the peace bid.    Mr Reynolds is due to go to the U.S. for a period including  St Patrick's Day, March 17, when he will meet President Clinton.  He said he would "avail of every appropriate opportunity to  present and promote in a balanced way the complexities of the  Northern Ireland conflict, as well as our efforts towards its  peaceful resolution.    "This will be of particular importance during my discussions  with President Clinton and congressional leaders."</p>

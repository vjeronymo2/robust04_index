			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Watchdog raps urban aid bodies URBAN DEVELOPMENT corporations have failed to meet at least 40 per cent of their performance targets, the National Audit Office, the government spending watchdog, says in a report today. But the NAO doubts whether performance measures have been well-defined, and suggests that the corporations may be even less successful. It says that the Department of the Environment has not been given sufficient information to fulfil its supervisory role. The report by Sir John Bourn, comptroller and auditor general, says output data are unreliable, that some achievements claimed by the corporations resulted from developments started before they were established, and that measures are inconsistently defined. It also raises questions about whether some projects in the pipeline will contribute to regeneration. The eight corporations covered by the report, which were established between 1987 and 1989, are projecting delivery of 5.5m sq metres of floor space during their lifetimes, in spite of a recent survey which found that 14m sq m of industrial floorspace is available in England, including 1.6m sq m in new buildings. Some building plans exceed the corporations' estimates of what is necessary. In the areas of two of the corporations - Trafford Park and Central Manchester - demand for 840,000 sq m has been identified by the corporations, which plan to build 1.29m sq m.

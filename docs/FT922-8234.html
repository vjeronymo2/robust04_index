			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / The awesome power of a Triple-A: Richard Waters on the impact of the credit rating agencies on the financial markets On Church Street in Manhattan, in a building sandwiched between City Hall and the twin towers of the World Trade Centre, a small group of people met recently to decide on a matter of vital importance to a bank on the other side of the Atlantic. The question: should Swiss Bank Corporation, one of the three mighty and secretive Swiss banks, remain one of the world's tiny band of top-rated financial institutions? The meeting took place at the offices of Moody's Investors Service, which, alongside Standard &amp; Poor's, is one of only two credit rating agencies with worldwide recognition. Among those present were Mr Ken Pinkes, responsible for the 42 analysts in Moody's financial institutions group, and Mr Don Noe, head of the agency's international side. With them was Mr Tom McGuire, head of all Moody's corporate ratings. Together, they represent one of the most powerful groups in the international financial markets. Their judgments on the standing of banks and other entities around the world determine how much it costs companies and governments to borrow money. In the event, the meeting decided to back the judgment of its young analyst, Mr John Kriz, a banking specialist who has been with Moody's for seven years. His view: that SBC should lose its cherished triple-A rating. The men on Church Street had reached a similar decision weeks before about Credit Suisse. That leaves only two European banks - Deutsche Bank and Union Bank of Switzerland - with an undisputed triple-A seal of approval. The Moody's decision, announced on Tuesday, comes in the week that rival S&amp;P decided to confirm its triple-A rating of all three big Swiss banks. The differences in the two agencies' views are stark. According to Moody's, there has been a 'recent material deterioration' in SBC's loan book. S&amp;P thought otherwise. 'Loan and asset quality are sound,' it said. This difference of view is important because both have had access to information hidden from investors. In the case of the Swiss banks, this includes details of their hidden reserves. As a result, the financial markets follow their judgments almost slavishly. Lower-rated borrowers pay higher interest rates in the debt markets. As the chart shows, this is particularly true during recessions, when concern about credit quality becomes most acute. When the agencies disagree, the markets feel uncertain. Investors and other financial institutions are left to guess at what has happened. 'I just wonder if Moody's has discovered some undisclosed problem in their (SBC's) loan book,' said the head of credit at one large bank in London. A less sinister explanation is the heavy subjective element that enters all ratings decisions. Both Moody's and S&amp;P have well-established methods for assessing a company's financial health, and S&amp;P even publishes guidelines of how financial ratios affect a company's rating. S&amp;P is widely regarded as being more scientific in its approach to ratings, relying heavily on the results of intensive number-crunching, while Moody's is said to take a broader view of a company and its environment. In practice, though, both rely ultimately on the judgments of their analysts. Not everyone is happy about their power. Bond market professionals complain that agencies react too late to factors which affect a company's credit standing. Naturally enough, companies which receive poor ratings complain bitterly, often adding that, being based in the US, the two global agencies simply don't understand non-US businesses. Concern about their power has percolated into the US political arena. Congressman John Dingell, chairman of the powerful House energy and commerce committee, is pressing for regulatory oversight of their activities. The agencies, along with four other smaller companies, enjoy the privilege of recognition from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, giving their ratings powerful standing. Yet the SEC does not vet the agencies at all. Similar concerns could migrate to Europe. French and UK regulators already officially recognise several rating agencies. The EC is about to do the same: its proposed directive on the capital backing needed by securities companies, to be agreed by the end of next month, explicitly recognises the ratings of bonds and other debt market securities. The EC's recognition of rating agencies is likely to give another push to attempts to develop European-based companies with the power to rival the global giants of the business. IBCA, a London-based agency and one of the six recognised in the US, has established a strong reputation around the world. Bertelsmann, the German media group, is now considering taking a majority stake in a new venture being planned by a powerful group of German banks and companies. 'It could fit in with our range of activities and make sense for us,' the company said yesterday. If it decides to act, Bertelsmann will enter a field dominated by publishing groups - McGraw Hill, which owns S&amp;P, and Dun &amp; Bradstreet, owner of Moody's. Only companies which are distant from the financial institutions, such as media groups, are generally considered to have the independence to run a rating agency. It could be that only Bertelsmann has the muscle to challenge US control of the business.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Iurie Rosca, leader of the Christian </F> Democratic Popular Front of Moldova, by Corina Caramete on 28  February; place not given: "A Gloomy Future for Bessarabia"]    [Text] [Caramete] After partial results have been  announced, what do you think the future composition of the  Republic of Moldova's Parliament will be?    [Rosca] I believe that the Communist Block [The Democratic  Agrarian Party, the Socialist Party and the Edinstvo, and the  Social Democratic Party] has ensured itself two-thirds of the  votes. We can say that the Alliance of the Democratic Christian  Popular Front [AFPCD] did not succeed in winning elections in  competition with Russia. We had to compete with Russia. The  balance of forces was somehow unequal.    [Caramete] The AFPCD nevertheless will have 10  parliamentarians.    [Rosca] Something like that.    [Caramete] Logically, Ilie Ilascu's release should follow  now, he was the second candidate on the AFPCD lists.    [Rosca] This would be normal. However, it is certain that  the struggle for his liberation will intensify, providing that  he succeeds in ending his current hunger strike and stays  healthy.    [Caramete] According to the law he should be released.    [Rosca] Certainly. When we enter parliament, the first  issue that we will table will be the release of Ilies Ilascu and  his group and the majority will not risk spoiling its image by  failing to support such an initiative.    [Caramete] It is possible that the parliamentary majority  will support this idea in word only.    [Rosca] Yes, it is possible, as has happened in the past two  years. However, when we are in parliament we will be able to  see whether something is indeed being done or whether everything  stops at certain futile declarations that can cover up the  complicity between the authorities of Chisinau and Tiraspol.    [Caramete] Are you going to dispute the elections?    [Rosca] We advanced several appeals disputing the results  during the electoral campaign and now, too, one day after the  elections. We will set down all cases of violation of the  electoral law, but these appeals certainly can have only a  propagandistic character. I do not think that they will have  any legal consequences for the current leadership, especially  considering -- as far as I could notice -- that the  international observers who were here almost unanimously  recognize the correctness of elections. I even heard somebody  who represented the Council of Europe saying on Chisinau radio  that the elections took place without violence. As if violations  were carried out with tanks. Thus, I do not believe that we  will obtain more than to succeed in drawing the public's  attention at home and abroad to the fact that these elections  were not democratic. Everything that is state authority, from  the very top down to the mayor's office, had been put at the  service of the Agrarian Democratic Party.    [Caramete] How do you think the political situation is going  to develop in the future?    [Rosca] The prospects are pretty gloomy. The program of the  Communist Block is known: federalization and immediate  adherence to the CIS. Thus, for the first time the 1940  occupation will be legalized definitively. Then, the law  regarding the official language will be reviewed and possibly  the 14th Army will be transformed from an occupying army into a  long-term Russian military base to ensure peace and stability in  the area. I believe that unfortunately the West will hail such  an idea. Probably the aggression of official anti-Romanian  propaganda will increase and new attempts to condemn the idea of  unification [with Romania] will follow. However, what the  imperialists always overlook are the fundamental human feelings:  a religious, and then a national feeling. In no way can these be  defeated by totalitarianism or a parliamentary majority. I was  talking with my colleagues the night of the elections about what  is going to be the first initiative of our parliamentary group.  We will turn to the parliamentary majority with the request to  let us keep our alphabet. Thus, this would be the last  stronghold. We might feel pretty bad if, in a probable  multinational state, it were finally recognized that we are a  Moldovan people and that we speak the Moldovan language [in  contrast to Romanian]. Just as dramatic will be the  discontinuation of relations with Romania in the area of  education and educational programs.    [Caramete] Have you thought about opposing the anti-Romanian  offensive?    [Rosca] Ilie Ilascu's book was issued in 250,000 copies. We  have paved Bessarabia with this book and this is the most useful  and most concise history of the Romanians and the most touching  assertion of the national identity in the present Republic of  Moldova. We are also preparing a long-term plan for our  activity and I believe that everything will turn out fine,  because communists do not understand this, namely that anything  that is against God will collapse, sometimes very rapidly and  spectacularly.</p>

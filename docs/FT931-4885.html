			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Spain threatens delay to EEA free-trade treaty SPAIN UPSET its 11 European Community partners yesterday by threatening to delay ratification of the European Economic Area, the treaty creating a free trade area of 370m people from the Arctic to the Mediterranean. Signalling growing frustration with the delay in ratification of the Maastricht treaty, Spain announced a 'go-slow' on parliamentary approval of the EEA. Mr Carlos Westendorp, a senior Spanish diplomat, told reporters that the Spanish parliament would wait until after the November elections to complete EEA ratification. The unilateral Spanish declaration caused consternation at a meeting of EC foreign ministers in Brussels. EC delegations had hoped to secure a joint commitment to ratify the EEA treaty between the EC and the European Free Trade Association in all 18 countries by July 1. Mr Westendorp implied the delay was linked to the hold-up in approval of the Maastricht treaty in Denmark and the UK. He said: 'July 1 is not a realistic date. Some of us are going to take a good deal longer, not least because we (the EC) have the Maastricht treaty to deal with.' The majority view in Brussels last night was that the EEA would still come into force this year. 'July 1 was never a realistic deadline,' said a Dutch diplomat. Spain's move cast a shadow over efforts to repair the damage to the EEA caused by Switzerland's rejection of the treaty in a referendum last December. It could jeopardise a hard-fought compromise under which the other six Efta members will contribute between 60 and 70 per cent of Switzerland's expected contribution to the EC's poorest countries - Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal. The new protocol on these so-called 'cohesion funds' was already weighted heavily in favour of the Community. Spain's threat to delay ratification could complicate enlargement negotiations with Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway, the four Efta countries which hoped to to join the EC by 1995, Brussels diplomats said. Finland is thought to be unhappy with the deal on Switzerland's contribution to cohesion funds because it risks encouraging Mediterranean countries, led by Spain, to bargain harder for Nordic concessions in the enlargement negotiations. A senior Efta diplomat added it might be difficult to justify the increased payments to Nordic voters who are already sceptical about the benefits of EC membership. The new agreement says that interest rate rebates provided by the six Efta members will be reduced from 3 per cent to 2 per cent. Switzerland was due to contribute 27 per cent of the Ecu2bn (Pounds 1.6bn) cohesion fund, split between Ecu1.5bn in loans and Ecu500m in grants. Diplomats noted yesterday, however, that the EEA deal covering farm products comes into force on April 15 and will not depend on ratification of the new EEA protocol - a concession which substantially benefits Spain.</p>

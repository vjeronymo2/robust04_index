			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Regulated institutions typically are subject to capital-based lending limits that restrict the amount of credit they can extend to any one borrower. While a $1 million business loan may be much more significant to a smaller institution, the agencies believe that a second capital-based limit in the appraisal regulation is inappropriate because it can place smaller institutions at a competitive disadvantage to larger institutions. In addition, the agencies regularly examine the lending practices of all regulated institutions and can address problems with individual institutions if they arise. The agencies believe it is appropriate, however, to place a limit on the size of loan that can qualify for this exemption. Many commenters agreed that a $1 million dollar limit was appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Primary Source of Repayment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters suggested that the exemption should be available only if the borrower could repay the loan entirely from sources other than sale of, or rental income derived from, real estate. Commenters also suggested specific percentage limits on the contribution of real estate to repayment of the loan ranging from 10 to 50 percent. Other commenters stated that the exemption should allow a regulated institution to determine whether a business loan requires an appraisal, regardless of the contribution of real estate sales or rental income to the borrower's repayment of the loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The exemption is intended to improve the ability of small- and medium-sized businesses to obtain real estate-secured loans for business purposes. As the contribution of real estate sales and rentals to the borrower's sources for repaying the loan increases, repayment becomes more dependent on the performance of the real estate market. Therefore, in deciding whether a transaction qualifies for this exemption, regulated institutions should be guided by the importance of the real estate-related sources of income to the borrower's repayment of the loan, rather than applying a universal numerical cap. In no case, however, may a business loan qualify for this exemption if real estate-related sources of income contribute more toward repayment of the loan than non-real estate sources of income.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Exempting these business loans will reduce the adverse effects on small- and medium-sized business lending associated with the requirement to obtain a Title XI appraisal. Moreover, since repayment of these loans generally will not depend primarily on the performance of the real estate markets, allowing lenders to make these business loans on the basis of evaluations of the real estate collateral does not threaten the safety and soundness of financial institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Agricultural Lending.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agencies received comment letters from appraisers in rural areas who stated that the exemption should not apply to agricultural production loans because use of the real estate generates the income for repayment of the loan. For any transaction exempt under this provision, the regulated institution is responsible for documenting that the borrower's sources of income are not primarily dependent upon the sale of, or rental income derived from, real estate. The agencies do not view the sale of growing crops as the sale of real estate, nor as providing rental income derived from real estate. The agencies have concluded that transactions involving agricultural operations present no greater risk than other types of business operations, provided the primary source of repayment for the loan is not sale of, or rental income derived from, real estate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (6) Leases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agencies did not propose changes to the existing exemption for leases. Under this exemption, regulated institutions are not required to obtain appraisals of leases that are not the economic equivalent of the purchase or sale of real estate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Even though the agencies did not propose changes to this exemption, some commenters suggested that Title XI appraisals should be required if a regulated institution takes any security interest in a real estate lease. The distinction between operating leases and capital leases is well recognized in accounting practice. Consistent with the distinction in accounting for operating and capital leases, the agencies have concluded that, in general, operating leases, which are not equivalent to the purchase or sale of the leased property, should not require Title XI appraisals given the limited real estate interest such leases represent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In transactions that involve capital leases (leases that are the economic equivalent of purchasing or selling real estate), the given real estate interest is of sufficient magnitude to be counted as an asset of the lessee under accounting practices. Generally, the agencies will continue to require regulated institutions to obtain appraisals in connection with transactions that involve capital leases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (7) Renewals, Refinancings, and Other Subsequent Transactions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agencies are adopting a modified version of the proposed exemption for renewals, refinancings, and other subsequent transactions at the lending institution to simplify the conditions under which the exemption applies. Under the final rule, regulated institutions will be permitted to renew or refinance existing extensions of credit without first obtaining a Title XI appraisal for two general classes of transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, a subsequent transaction is exempt provided there has been no obvious and material change in market conditions or physical aspects of the property that threatens the adequacy of the institution's real estate collateral protection after the transaction, even with the advancement of new funds. This modification to the proposed rule is intended to emphasize that an institution must consider the effect of changes in market conditions and physical aspects of the property on its collateral protection when it advances funds in excess of reasonable closing costs as part of a renewal, refinancing, or other subsequent transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, a subsequent transaction is exempt provided that no new monies are advanced other than funds necessary to cover reasonable closing costs. The proposed rule did not explicitly address this class of transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agencies note that this exemption would not be applicable if a borrower refinances a mortgage with a new lender.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior to the adoption of this amendment, the agencies did not require a Title XI appraisal for a subsequent transaction that resulted from a maturing extension of credit if:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The borrower had performed satisfactorily according to the original terms;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) No new monies were advanced other than as previously agreed;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The credit standing of the borrower had not deteriorated; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) There had been no obvious and material deterioration in market conditions or physical aspects of the property which would threaten the institution's collateral protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the agencies' experience, the original exemption may not have provided sufficient flexibility to regulated institutions and borrowers when a transaction was refinanced before its maturity. This is particularly true for refinancings to reduce a loan's interest rate. Further, bankers questioned whether a Title XI appraisal would be required for a refinancing where the borrower's payment history is sound and future repayment prospects are good, but the borrower's collateral has declined in value as a result of a general market decline. The agencies believe that not requiring a Title XI appraisal in such refinancings is consistent with safe and sound banking practices because the amount of the loan (except for the addition of reasonable closing costs) and the lender's collateral remain the same, and the lower loan payments may improve the ability of the borrower to repay the loan without adversely affecting the likelihood that the lender will be repaid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

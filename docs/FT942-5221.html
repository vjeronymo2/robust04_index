			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Business Travel: Chinese accidents More attention to safety has been ordered by Chinese civil aviation officials after dozens of near-accidents have been reported so far this year. The China News Service said yesterday that 'several tens' of near-accidents had occurred, including aircraft going off the runway or landing at an angle, aircraft wings brushing and engines 'stopping in mid-air'. China's airlines have been trying to improve their reputation after a succession of crashes in 1992 and 1993 killed nearly 400 people. The government regulatory body, the Civil Aviation Administration of China, announced plans late last year to improve maintenance and safety training.</p>

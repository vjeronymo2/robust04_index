			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Move to open market in peak energy BRITISH GAS is discussing with the Monopolies and Mergers Commission the creation of a market for trading peak loads of gas as a way of maintaining cheap prices for big industrial users. The commission, which is reviewing British Gas's UK business, is encouraging the company to find ways of opening the so-called interruptible market to rivals without jeopardising the low prices on offer in that market. Large energy consumers which pay 'bargain basement' prices in that market in return for being cut off during times of peak demand are worried that prices will have to rise as British Gas yields part of its market share to its competitors. Mr Tony Mitchell-Harris of English China Clays, who represents gas users on the Major Energy Users' Council, said: 'It is absolutely essential for the viability of British industry that prices in the interruptible market stay where they are now.' Competitors to British Gas have secured about 50 per cent of the firm contract market - where prices are higher and consumers do not run the risk of being cut off - but none has so far penetrated the interruptible market. Interruptible gas users pay about 17p a therm compared with 20p to 40p a therm in the firm market. Rival suppliers argue that interruptible prices will have to rise to encourage competition. British Gas is obliged to shed part of its market share of interruptible sales to fulfil undertakings the company has made to the Office of Fair Trading on giving up 60 per cent of its share of the whole industrial market by 1995. Mr Ian Powe, chairman of the Gas Consumers' Council, told a conference in London yesterday that British Gas 'will very probably put up the price of interruptible gas. The price will rise until it reaches a convergence either with alternative fuel or with a price that is attractive to competitors supplying firm gas.' Rival suppliers say this means the price will have to increase by at least 3p a therm. Mr Powe said this would adversely affect large industrial consumers and inhibit their ability to compete with other EC member states. The commission is looking at ways of balancing peak supplies in a form of spot market, although discussions are still at a very early stage.</p>

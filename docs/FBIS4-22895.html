Avchiyeva, A.Yu. Vinarov, I.A. Kozlova, </F> National Scientific Research Institute of Protein Compound  Biosynthesis, Moscow; UDC 576.8.095]    [Abstract] Extensive uses of citric acid--an important  organic acid for the food, medical, and pharmaceutical  industries--due to its low toxicity and easy metabolism and the  advantages of glucose in citric acid production by fermentation  are noted; moreover, the use of glucose during Aspergillus  niger fermentation greatly facilitates research into the  patterns of citric acid biosynthesis under continuous  fermentation. Today, the Charles Pfizer Inc. and Miles  Laboratories Inc. companies, both in the United States, are the  largest citric acid producers. Despite considerable successes in  the citric acid production methods by periodic fermentation,  search is underway for a continuous method utilizing both  A. niger and n-paraffins with Candida  lipolytica, yet persistent problems of the continuous  cultivation method, e.g., a drop in the citric acid  concentration in the medium with a transition to continuous  operation, prompted a comparative study of the biomass and  citric acid biosynthesis by the A. niger culture from  glucose under periodic and continuous fermentation. To this end,  the A. niger fungus is used. The cultivation  procedure is outlined. It is noted that in order to optimize the  nutrient medium composition and avoid precipitating heavy metal  salts thus eliminating the possibility of using the fungal  biomass as a feed additive, the fungus was cultivated in a  specially selected water-mineral medium containing glucose as  the carbon source. The citric acid biosynthesis yield under  these conditions depends on the cell concentration in the  medium, the medium dilution rate, and diffusion properties of  the culture. The study reveals the possibility of realizing  two-stage fermentation: a biomass accumulation stage and induced  citric acid excretion stage. The latter is facilitated by  dimethylsulfoxide which is continuously added to the medium at  the second fermentation stage at a 0.5% concentration. As  a  result, the citric acid concentration is higher that after  conventional two-stage cultivation without induced excretion.  The findings make it possible to develop stable and intensive  citric acid production. Figures 9; references 13: 7 Russian, 6  Western.</p>

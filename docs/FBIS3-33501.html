The  preparations for the high-level meeting, which will determine  the disarmament of El Chacal, were made yesterday afternoon by  Sergio Caramagna, mediator and coordinator of CIAV-OAS  [International Commission of Support and Verification-OAS] and  Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta.    The meeting with El Chacal is scheduled to be held at noon  today [as heard] at Caulatu, the same place where the rearmed  group last year kidnapped two Sandinist deputies and several  government officials. Yesterday, the Army withdrew all of its  troops from the area to facilitate the meeting.    In addition to Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta, who  leads the government delegation, the other people who will  attend the meeting are Colonel Javier Carrion, on behalf of the  EPS [Sandinist People's Army], while the Catholic Church has  appointed Dr. Winston Betanco.    Government sources reported the government delegation is  fully empowered to solve the conflict with the rearmed men from  the 3-80 Northern Front.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, PRI [Institutional  Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate, has formally  invited two of his colleagues, PAN [National Action Party] and  PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution] presidential candidates  Diego Fernandez de Zevallos and Cuahutemoc Cardenas,  respectively, to a public debate.    [Begin Zedillo recording, in progress] ...agree that the  upcoming elections are of special importance for the future of  the country. Mexican society demands a strengthened democracy  for peace, unity, and justice. Democracy requires legality,  impartiality, and transparency in the elections. Democracy also  requires the promotion of dialogue and respectful debate among  those who aspire to the presidency of the republic.    All the presidential candidates have expressed their  willingness to publicly debate ideas and programs. Luis Donaldo  Colosio was the first to call for a debate. I have personally  reiterated at different campaign rallies my desire to hold a  debate.    I trust that throughout the campaign there will be an  opportunity to discuss our positions with all candidates from  all parties. Therefore, I now respectfully invite Diego  Fernandez de Zevallos and Engineer Cuahutemoc Cardenas to  discuss as soon as possible and in public our ideas and  political programs.    The citizens' demand and the expressed willingness of the  contenders make it possible that the debate be held as soon as  possible. Therefore, I expect a prompt response from Fernandez  de Zevallos and Engineer Cardenas. I propose the debate be  carried live by radio and television in a format of  unquestionable impartiality, transparency, and fairness. I  propose one single broadcast that can be received and  transmitted by all radio and television stations that wish to  join be used, without favoring any specific enterprise.    In addition, conditions must be established so that  representatives of the print media can cover the debate to their  full satisfaction. I believe that to make the debate a fair  political exercise and fruitful for citizens, the candidates  must have equal time to explain their ideas. Additionally, we  must have the opportunity to comment on the responses from the  other candidates and issue an opening and final statement. A  moderator of absolute integrity and recognized impartiality  would help candidates adjust to the time allotted.    This would be the first debate among presidential candidates  in Mexico's modern history. Holding the debate would give all  citizens the opportunity to learn directly about our ideas and  programs as well as allow the public a respectful exchange of  ideas. Above all else, holding this debate would strengthen our  democracy because it would permit voters to compare the  different political programs in order to select freely among  them.    I am fully confident the debate will make it clear that my  party has the best program to secure Mexicans a future of  well-being, democracy, and justice. I am fully confident public  opinion will be able to confirm that the PRI's candidacy to the  presidency of the republic offers the leadership, service  experience, and social sensibility required to achieve the  progress of Mexico. Many thanks. [end recording]</p>

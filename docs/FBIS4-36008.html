			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, June 2 (AFP) -- Northern Yemeni troops fired  missiles and artillery shells at a Palestinian camp on Thursday  [2 June] in Dar Sa'd, north of the southern stronghold Aden,  Palestinian sources said here.    Thirty Palestinian families were evacuated from the camp to  Aden, the sources said, but it was not known whether anybody was  killed or injured in the attack.    Several Palestinian camps are situated in Yemen. The attack  came as gun battles raged around Aden on Thursday despite a UN  resolution Wednesday for a cease-fire in the civil war which  broke out on May 5.    At least six civilians were injured during northern air  raids  on Aden Thursday, a southern military source said.</p>

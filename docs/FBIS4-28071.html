			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Sandwiched Between United States and </F> China, Japan Is Agonizing"]    [Text] Japan, sandwiched between the United States, which  is poised to begin a full-fledged study of ways to impose  sanctions against North Korea for its suspected development of  nuclear weapons, and China, which is cautious about any  sanctions against North Korea, is agonizing over how it should  conduct its diplomacy.    The Foreign Ministry's view is that if the UN Security  Council [UNSC] continues to hold discussions on imposing  sanctions against North Korea, leaving the current deadlock over  the issue unbroken, the UNSC would inevitably vote to adopt a  resolution warning North Korea, the substance of which is  harsher than that of two presidential statements, or to impose  the first mild economic sanctions against North Korea. According  to a high-ranking government official, the government plans to  place priority on what the United States advocates if the United  States and China split in their opinions on sanctions against  North Korea, but the government intends to vigorously persuade  China, which is negative about imposing sanctions against North  Korea. The government believes that if China is isolated from  the rest of the world because of the North Korean nuclear issue,  it would lead to instability in the Asia-Pacific region. The  government is concerned that Japan would have limited policy  options if a situation were created wherein China vetoes a  resolution slapping sanctions on North Korea and the United  States responds to China's action by taking the lead in imposing  multinational-type sanctions against North Korea outside the  United Nations. The Hata government wants to promote a strategy  under which Japan makes aggressive international contributions  mainly through the United Nations. It seeks permanent  membership in the UNSC, and it vigorously participates in the UN  Peacekeeping Operations (PKO). For the Hata government, it is  most desirable for all permanent members of the UNSC, including  China, to take concerted actions to settle the North Korean  nuclear issue.    Unlike the Gulf war in which the United States took  initiatives in the UNSC and led multinational forces in fighting  against Iraq, the Clinton administration has continued to  cautiously deal with the North Korean nuclear issue while  watching the progress of negotiations between the IAEA and North  Korea. The United Kingdom and France have taken a tough stand  on the North Korean nuclear issue. It appears that their tough  stand has not become a consensus in the UNSC because of the  cautious U.S. stand.    A growing number of officials in the government think of the  need to reaffirm Japan's cooperation with the United States,  saying: "We must think of forging a Japan-U.S. alliance in light  of the North Korean nuclear issue" (according to a top  government official). Japan, however, cannot make light of  relations with China which have a great impact on Japan's  security. Prime Minister Hata is likely to be pressed to make a  difficult diplomatic response to the North Korean nuclear issue.</p>

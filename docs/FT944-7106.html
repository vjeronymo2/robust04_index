			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / S Korean opposition chief quits parliament Mr Lee Ki-taek, South Korea's main opposition leader, resigned his parliamentary seat yesterday in protest at the recent decision by the government not to prosecute two former presidents for their role in a 1979 military coup that brought them to power. Mr Lee, who has blocked parliamentary proceedings for the last three weeks over the issue, called on other MPs to follow his example and force a general election. But analysts believe his surprise move may instead cost him the leadership of the Democratic party (DP) because some party officials regard his position as too extreme. 'He has painted himself into a corner,' said one aide to Mr Kim Dae-jung, the former DP head. Mr Lee, who has been criticised for his hapless leadership since becoming party head two years ago, sought to use the government's failure to prosecute former presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo as an issue to strengthen his position within the party. By confronting the government, he hoped to rally support behind his leadership. Many DP members opposed the military government after the coup leaders violently suppressed a 1980 revolt in the city of Kwangju, the party's main power base. But some senior DP officials, including the party's founder Mr Kim, have urged Mr Lee to abandon his hardline attitude and resume parliamentary proceedings, which will include the scheduled approval of South Korea's membership of the World Trade Organisation. The fate of former presidents Chun and Roh has also posed a political problem for the current President Kim Young-sam, who was an opponent of military rule in the 1980s. President Kim favoured leniency for the two former presidents because he feared that prosecuting them could lead to a split within the ruling Democratic Liberal party. Prosecutors said Mr Chun and Mr Roh would not be charged with military rebellion because of their subsequent service to the country. The majority of DLP MPs are allies of Mr Chun and Mr Roh. The DLP was created in 1991 following a merger between then-president Roh's ruling party and Mr Kim's smaller opposition group. There have been persistent rumours that conservative MPs may soon quit the DLP and form a new party to oppose President Kim because of concerns that they will not be renominated for parliamentary seats in the 1996 elections.</p>

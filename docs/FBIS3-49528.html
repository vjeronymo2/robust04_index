			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Railroad Track Macedonia-Bulgaria"] </F>   [Text] The railroad link up of Macedonia with Bulgaria is  soon expected to be realized. In Macedonia, two lines, in the  direction Kocani-Blagoevgrad (Bulgaria) or Kumanovo-Guesevo  (Bulgaria), are envisaged. The route Kocani-Blagoevgrad  foresees the construction of a new track long 145 km, and which  will cost $430 million. The second route Kumanovo-Guesevo  consists of a track long 46 km, at the cost of $120 million.  The direction Kumanovo-Guesevo is given the advantage, in view  of the costs and the quick realization. The public in Kocani is  complaining about this and believes that the government is not  well informed as to the advantages of this route, which would  connect their own town with Bulgaria.</p>

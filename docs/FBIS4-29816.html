			<p>BFN     [Text] China has cautioned the Philippines to go slowly on  its proposal for an arms registry in Southeast Asia because it  might raise "suspicions" among the countries concerned and  depict an arms race in the region, Foreign Affairs  Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino said over the weekend.    "They (China) said we should not be in a great hurry to push  for this (arms registry) proposal because ... to push too hard  might itself raise suspicions," Mr. Severino said after China's  foreign ministry officials met with their local counterparts for  the annual Philippines-China bilateral consultations in Manila  last Thursday.    Manila called for the establishment of an arms registry in  the region during a senior officials meeting among member-states  of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Bangkok  recently to ensure transparency of military armaments,  particularly on imports, exports, enhancement and weapons  expenditures.    Mr. Severino said Beijing has agreed, however, to an ASEAN  proposal to have Brunei collect various proposals on the  framework and mechanism of a regional arms registry.    "What was agreed upon was to look at several proposals (for  an arms registry) and then study it even further. But we told  them (Beijing) we are pushing for more speed and progress on  this," Mr. Severino said.    During the ASEAN senior officials meet, member-states agreed  to temporarily shelve the Philippine proposal for an arms  registry. Instead, the officials suggested that the United  Nations model be studied further since it was only established  last year.    The Philippine proposal goes beyond the scope of the UN  model  and includes transparency on the production of indigenous  military weapons as well as expenditures.    Despite having a different perspective on the Philippine  proposal Beijing has nonetheless supported Manila's call to have  the arms registry issue tackled during next month's ASEAN  Regional Forum (ARF) in Bangkok.    The ARF will bring together the foreign ministers of the six  ASEAN countries (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,  Singapore and Thailand) along with its seven dialogue partners  (Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, New  Zealand, and the United States) to tackle growing security  concerns in the Asia Pacific.    It will also have China, Russia, Vietnam, Laos and Papua New  Guinea in the discussion table.</p>

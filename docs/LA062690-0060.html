			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> MONTOYA'S JAIL TERM DELAYED BY APPEAL  </P> <P> Former state Sen. Joseph B. Montoya's scheduled date with prison was  temporarily delayed when his attorneys filed a motion with the U.S. 9th Circuit  Court of Appeals requesting bail while his case is under review. The Whittier  Democrat, sentenced to 6 1/2 years in prison for his conviction on seven  corruption charges, had been scheduled to report to prison Friday. But now it  will be up to the appeals court to determine whether Montoya has a substantial  chance of winning his appeal and therefore should be allowed to remain free on  bail.  </P></p>

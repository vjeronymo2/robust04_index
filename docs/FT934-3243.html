			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Government Bonds: Successful auction gives further boost to UK gilts The Bank of England's successful auction of UK government bonds gave the market a further boost, with long-dated prices closing up a half to three-quarters of a point. The Bank sold Pounds 3bn of 6 3/4 per cent Treasury stock due 2004 taking the size of the issue to Pounds 6.25bn. The lowest accepted price was 101.26, yielding 6.51 per cent, while the highest was 101.29, yielding 6.50 per cent. The cover, or ratio of bids to offers, was much higher than expected at 2.19 times, reflecting strong demand for the issue, which will take over as the new liquid 10-year benchmark next year. 'There was enough demand out there for the Bank to sell Pounds 6bn of stock,' exclaimed one dealer. The Bank announced a further Pounds 1.2bn in tap issues in the afternoon, available for dealing from today. Dealers do not expect this to halt the market's momentum and predict that prices will remain firm. The tap stocks include Pounds 400m of 6 per cent stock due 1999; Pounds 400m of 8 per cent due 2013; Pounds 200m of 4 5/8 per cent index-linked gilts due 1998; and Pounds 200m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked due 2024. Dealers noted strong demand from domestic and overseas investors as well as from proprietary traders. The US Treasury market drifted higher as traders awaiting today's November producer price data. In late trading, the 30-year bond was up 1/32 at 101 5/32 , yielding 6.159 per cent and the two-year note was 1/16 ahead at 100 3/16 , to yield 4.133 per cent. With the report on wholesale prices due out this morning, activity was listless for a second straight session. The lack of direction stemmed in part from the conviction that the data will provide a favourable reading on inflation, with a 0.2 per cent uptick generally forecast. That optimism was supported by a sense that it would take very bad news indeed to rattle the market, in view of its response to last week's strong employment figures and to recent veiled warnings on inflation by Federal Reserve governors. Prices ebbed until midday, when the Fed's Beige Book summary of regional economic conditions was released. As expected, it presented no obstacles for bonds, painting another picture of low inflation and moderate growth. On the announcement, the market began to inch forward, crossing into positive territory in mid-afternoon. The strength of the French franc, combined with optimism about the progress being made on the Gatt talks, helped push French government bond yields sharply lower across much of the yield curve. The franc returned to its former narrow ERM trading range for the first time since the summer currency tensions. Bonds rallied and the Matif December futures contract ended up 0.60 at 125.12. French bonds outperformed their German counterparts, with the 10-year yield spread narrowing to 8 basis points, from 16 points on Tuesday and 22 points last week. Dealers said the recent disappointing economic news - lower than expected third-quarter growth and a big rise in bankruptcies - together with the franc's strength, ought to encourage an interest rate cut, although this was not reflected in yesterday's smallish move in the Pibor contract. German government bonds rallied late in the day, encouraged by the rise in the other main European markets. The main focus was the sale of the 6 per cent bund due 2016, sold at average yield of 6.24 per cent, or 41 basis points above the 10-year benchmark. The Bundesbank said it had accepted DM4.363bn in bids for the 6 per cent 22 1/2 -year bonds. All bids at 97.06 and above were accepted and the average yield was 6.24 per cent. Also, DM1.637bn in bonds were allocated to the central bank for market intervention purposes. The Dutch government bond market closed higher, helped by continued strong demand for the new 10-year state bond. Sales of the 5.75 per cent bond due 2004 amounted to Fl 11bn at an average yield of 5.82 per cent. Elsewhere in Europe, Belgian government bonds rallied, helped by the strength of the currency, with the spread over German 10-year bonds narrowing from 91 basis points to 85 basis points.</p>

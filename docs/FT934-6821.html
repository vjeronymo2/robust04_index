			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Banks start to scramble for safe borrowers: John Gapper finds that competition is hotting up in the corporate lending arena Is history repeating itself? After three years spent recovering from the disasters of the late 1980s, European banks are displaying signs of returning to the past. The strongest evidence has emerged in lending to large companies, where competition is becoming more fierce. One example came earlier this month when an Dollars 800m loan to Pechiney, the state-controlled French aluminium group, was heavily over-subscribed by banks wanting to join syndicates. Large creditworthy companies - those perceived as single A or above - are being offered loans at rates well below those prevailing two years ago. The slipping of margins has evoked memories of the late 1980s, when a lending push by Japanese and other foreign banks led to intense competition. Pressure eased in late 1990 after a wave of corporate failures shocked banks. Some withdrew, margins were pushed up and loan covenants tightened. But lending competition has now resurfaced. While banks could get margins of more than 50 basis points (half a percentage point) above the London inter-bank offered rate (Libor) a year ago, investment grade companies are now seeking lending in the mid-30s above Libor, and even lower. Mr Hugh Paton, head of credit marketing and execution for JP Morgan in Europe, says there has been a 'pronounced contraction in spreads' for high quality companies. Mr Stanley Hurn, Midland Bank's head of loan syndication, says the margin for investment grade companies this year has been the upper-30s over Libor, but 'the benchmark is being challenged. Banks are out there wanting to do business.' There are a number of reasons for the narrowing of margins. The first is that loan demand remains weak - relatively few well rated companies want to borrow. Activity has been stronger in the commercial paper and medium-term bond markets as old debt has been restructured. The potential supply of loans has also increased. British banks have noticed the re-emergence of some foreign banks which pulled back from London at the end of the last decade. European banks have also become more active. In addition, most banks have more lending capacity. The capital of US banks has been considerably strengthened by a favourable yield curve, and European banks have started to rebuild the capital weakened by loan losses in the 1980s. The hunger for loan assets is increased by the fact that many fixed-term loans from the late 1980s are being repaid. 'Many banks whose balance sheets expanded in the 1980s are now seeing a big run-off, and they are left with holes in their books they want to fill,' says Mr Paton. This also means banks are feeling stronger because the yield on their portfolios has risen. 'A substantial proportion of loans churn every year and banks have seen a significant pick-up in yields,' says Mr Peter Newman, managing director of corporate banking at National Westminster Bank. The rekindling of competition has shown itself in narrowing margins, in the way loans are structured and in the terms of loan covenants, such as the ratio of interest payments to a corporation's income. Mr Neil Harland, managing director of corporate banking at Barclays, says an example of more favourable loan structures is that banks are again becoming willing to lend to holding companies, rather than having loans directly secured on the operating subsidiaries which produce the income to meet interest payments. Covenants which were tightened considerably after the defaults of the 1980s are also starting to loosen. Banks say that single A companies are chafing at the tough restrictions when facilities come up for renewal, and insisting on re-negotiation. All these trends seem to undermine banks' claims that they have learned their lessons and are no longer willing to compete for lending which does not provide high enough returns to cover risk. However, the implications are not as clear as they appear. An important aspect of lending to large investment-grade companies is that it is one of the least risky activities. Banks say the strong competition for such borrowers reflects a new aversion to high-yield, high-risk lending. Mr David Harrison, Lloyds Bank's senior general manager for corporate banking, says that margins have only narrowed for the lowest-risk loans. 'As soon as you get below the As, you find people are much more cautious about risk. At that point the pressure on margin is secondary.' He believes this emphasis on low-risk lending shows that banks are not slipping back into ill-calculated competition. 'I do not think it is a dangerous scene. I have heard people say 'here we go again' but I do not subscribe to that view.' Nonetheless, the margins on loans to highly rated companies are starting to approach the point where some bankers question whether they cover the cost of capital. That implies that banks would be wise to exercise caution if margins slip further, no matter how assiduously they are concentrating on quality borrowers.</p>

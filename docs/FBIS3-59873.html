			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by 'Abd-al-Jabbar Muhsin: "An Accounting of </F> Failures"]    [Text] Iraq cuts the lifeline to the south. Iraq blockades  the north. Iraq impoverishes the central region. What is this  Iraq that works against its south, north, and everything in  between? What is this Iraq that works against Iraq, trying to  assassinate it?    Ask the Security Council and those who dominate its  resolutions. They are the ones dominating and besieging all of  Iraq. They forbid all Iraq to have a loaf of bread, medicine,  and cloth--with official resolutions they are proud of, which  they are delighted to agree upon. They allege that all is well  in the world, even that the world is new and pure, as stable as  a mountain top. Why? Because the big people who are manipulated  by the United Nations agree to extend the sanctions and to  deprive Iraq of all imports and exports. And shamelessly,  without any feeling of fraud or deceit, they claim that Iraq is  besieging itself.    Iraq has become, from their point of view, a hook on which  they may hang all their errors and evils, including their crimes  against Iraq.    Again: Why?    First, because Iraq is a huge reservoir of oil in the grip  of  a powerful people; they want its oil for free or almost free,  down to the last drop, not just down to the last barrel.    Secondly, because Iraq has reclaimed its [oil] wealth from  the clutches of big companies and gone on to handle it justly,  neither oppressing buyers nor cheating sellers.    Third, because Iraq has used its oil revenues to benefit  people: to build factories, roads, and bridges, universities,  schools, clinics, and residential buildings; to eliminate  illiteracy and to liberate people from ignorance. In short, Iraq  has moved quickly toward modernization, to bridge the gap  between it and post-industrial society. That is to say, its  resources have not ended up at roulette wheels, or in banks to  be brazenly stolen, nor have the revenues from our resources  been distributed among kings and princes.    Fourth, Iraq has become a power, a force for the truth that  it defends. It is a power, a treasury of civilization, a power  to strive toward a future where everything is new and honest.    Iraq is a force for a unique mind and a powerful arm. These  factors have all strengthened the philosophy and logic of  Commander Saddam Husayn, and his management of matters of state  and society. I say these factors have been strengthened, making  Iraq a material and military power.    This power has nothing to do with aggression, nor do its  people have any time for aggression against anyone else. It is  not in their character to encroach on other people's rights,  though they may respond to aggression. It is enough that they  safeguard their building; it is enough that they are protective  of justice, and profoundly opposed to all evil.    Fifth, when they failed in their plan to alienate the leader  from those he leads; when God, the people, and Saddam Husayn  thwarted their efforts to destroy the people's spirit, to kill  the conscience of the resistance, then their hatred increased,  and these failed people's hatred grew even more bitter and  crafty.    Today the whole world knows that Iraq has departed from the  script written in the West. Countries have fallen, blocs have  collapsed, people and countries have been torn apart. Leaders  have crumbled under American pressure; some have chosen to rely  on the refuge and the mercies of their enemy. All this has  happened, yet Iraq remains as it wants to be, not as  they want; as God, not they, has decreed.    And so?    The masters of many traitorous individuals admitted their  failure even before we said so.    These many utterances from the marshes, mountains, coasts,  and valleys are unmoved. We are and will remain justified  because we are believers.</p>

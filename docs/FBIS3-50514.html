			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] JATHA--Finance Minister Fernando Illanes told  American investors that only 15 percent of Bolivia's potential  hydrocarbon resources have been explored and developed, and  emphasized the investment opportunities in the various sectors.    According to Illanes, there is an oil and gas potential of  53  percent in the 386,000 square miles of national territory, and  it is considered that only 15 percent of that area has been  explored and developed.    He described the petroleum as light, and noted that there  are  extensive fields with natural gas deposits.    He also indicated that proven reserves of gas have amounted  to 6 trillion cubic feet over the past 10 years, and that  current gas exports to Argentina amount to 200 million cubic  feet per day.    Illanes indicated that projected natural gas exports to  Brazil could exceed 1.1 trillion cubic feet at a rate of 250  billion cubic feet per day, bringing investments to more than  $2.8 billion.    Regarding investment opportunities in the electricity  sector,  Illanes reported that generating capacity is 550 megawatts, with  the possibility of rising to 900 megawatts by the year 2000.    He explained that the National Electric Power Enterprise  (ENDE) expects to build some 1,000 kilometers of transmission  lines.    Among the incentives that will encourage foreign investment  are the efficiency of generation and the installation of  distribution companies.    In addition, he indicated that the growth rate is estimated  at 7 percent a year, and that the new investments in the sector  could generate more than $300 million between 1995 and 2000.    Concerning opportunities in the telecommunications sector,  he  described the following:     -  Telephone density of 2.7 lines per 100 inhabitants. The  lowest percentage is 5.8 lines per 100 inhabitants. [as  published]    -  Eighty percent of service is concentrated in La Paz,  Santa Cruz, and Cochabamba, with 40 percent, 25 percent, and 15  percent, respectively.    -  Only 45 percent of international calls  are completed.       He explained that unsatisfied demand today amounts to  100,000  lines, 50 percent more than the number currently installed, and  that density is expected to be 5.2 lines per 100 inhabitants by  the year 2000.    In this regard, an investment of $630 million will be  required over the next 10 years, and some 400,000 new lines will  be installed by the year 2000.    Regarding the National Telecommunications Enterprise  (ENTEL),  Illanes stated that in 1992 it had approximately $42 million in  current operating cash, and it paid $25 million in dividends.    Illanes explained that the national airline, Lloyd Bolivian  Airline (LAB), primarily services international routes, but it  also dominates the domestic market.    He added that LAB has an inadequate, old, and fuel-guzzling  fleet, so the capitalization of the firm will require some $40  million. In addition, the privatization of airports and air  services is contemplated.    He stressed that the National Railway Enterprise (ENFE) has  a  monopoly on that service, and noted that the state-run railway  has reduced its surplus employees from 5,000 to 2,900. ENFE has  a net value of approximately $80 million, he said, and its  operational costs cover its operational income.    After stating that Bolivia is primarily a mining country, he  explained that mining exports from the private sector exceeded  those of the public sector, and that in the last few years  foreign investment has amounted to $10 million.</p>

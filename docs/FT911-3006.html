			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (13): 'If it gets any worse, your houses could be at risk' - The plowshares / Recession darkens the Review's soap The Plowshares, John and Alison, are a couple in their late forties with two children: Lucy, who is at university; and Toby, who still lives at home. John Plowshare is an architect earning Pounds 60,000, while Alison has a part-time job as a receptionist at a doctor's surgery. Because of the death of John's parents, and his subsequent inheritance, the Plowshares have a portfolio of Pounds 50,000 in unit trusts, Pounds 6,000 each in a personal equity plan, and just over Dollars 36,000 deposited in the building society. In this episode, we find John and his partners Tom and Amanda at the Plowshares' house, mulling over the rather bad news that their accountant has given them on the current financial state of their partnership. IT'S MONDAY evening, and John, Tom and Amanda are gathered round the kitchen table in the Plowshares' kitchen, conducting a brainstorming session on the state of the architectural industry today, and the more immediately pressing problem of the state of their architectural practice today. 'Something's got to give,' says Tom. 'We just can't afford all these overheads.' Business, largely from the public housing and office-building sectors, had flooded into their practice for eight years, until last summer when the impact of high interest rates caused a significant drop in worthwhile enquiries. Since then, the staff have been kept busy, finishing off current projects. Now, the facts have to be faced: that there isn't any more, or any likelihood of any more, work on the horizon. 'Yep, something's got to give,' agrees Amanda, sadly pouring herself another glass of wine. John casts a wistful glance out of the window at his brand-new top-of-the-range car parked outside the garage, gleaming with prestige and bursting with executive gadgets. Through the other window, he can see his partners' cars, parked in the street and looking equally appealing and equally expensive. He heaves a sigh. 'Right, let's get down to it.' Mr Ledger, the company accountant, has studied the books, talked to each of the partners and written a massive plan of action, to try to save the practice. He has pointed out that, as a partnership, the three architects have unlimited liability against partnership debts. 'If the problem gets any worse, your houses could be at risk,' he has told them. 'If you make severe cutbacks now, while you still can, you might be able to salvage enough of a business to have something left when the good times come around again.' The Budget, largely aimed at helping companies with difficulties such as theirs, has in fact little real help to offer the partnership. However, Mr Ledger has recommended that the partners switch to paying VAT on a cash basis, in response to the campaign the Customs &amp; Excise department has started: 'Even with current problems, your income is over the Pounds 35,000 threshold but well under the Pounds 300,000 limit for cash accounting,' says Mr Ledger. 'Switching to only paying VAT when you actually receive payment will give you a massive cash-flow injection which is something you really need at the moment.' The first cutback is that the remaining staff - who, apart from the three partners, amount to Dawn, the office manager, and an architectural student gaining practical experience - are to be made redundant. 'You'll have to manage any work that comes in on your own,' says Mr Ledger, 'even typing the letters. The staff have been with the practice for less than two years, and so are not entitled to redundancy money. They have been paid on a PAYE basis, and over the past three months payment of their tax has fallen into arrears. 'Keep it that way,' recommends the redoubtable Mr Ledger. 'There's no interest on PAYE arrears, and you have your own tax bills coming up. If you go into arrears on those, you will pay interest.' The thought of the July approach of tax bills has sobered up the threesome even further. Self-employed people pay their tax on a year-before basis. The tax bill that arrives in July will reflect earnings for the year 1989-90 - a year that John, Tom and Amanda remember, now rather ruefully, as a high-income year. The partners have stopped paying themselves salaries, and their payments into pension plans and private medical insurance schemes have been suspended  -dismissed as luxuries by Mr Ledger. The accountant has also recommended that the partners chop up their company credit-cards, and as each wields the kitchen scissors the gloom deepens. The partnership's offices are the next to receive the attention of Mr Ledger. The office rent has fallen into arrears - a step that Mr Ledger approves of: 'Hold fire on the rent,' he stoutly advises. 'You need the cash too much. Advertise to sub-let your spare office space. A large empty office has bad vibes for creative people.' But poor John, Tom and Amanda don't feel very creative. John has been in touch with the Royal Institute of British Architects, to see what help they can offer. The RIBA's London region redundancy counselling service has proved to be extremely busy at the moment - which John finds comforting, in a gloomy sort of way - and the advice offered has proved upbeat and positive: 'The RIBA has told me that part of the strategy for surviving the recession at the moment is to be well-placed to take advantage of the up-swing,' he says. 'They recommend taking a long and honest look at the practice, analysing strengths, weaknesses, resources and staff expertise.' The partners look at each other with some amusement, hunting for signs of expertise, but the atmosphere does cheer up a little as they each decide to take a new area in which to research new business opportunities. John fancies himself as a 1990s Green person, and so volunteers to research developments in energy-saving and environmentally-sound work. Tom has been the housing king in his time, and is looking towards bombarding the Housing Corporation, which remains a great unknown at present but might have funding free next year, with quantities of material on the merits of using their practice over all others. Amanda, looking towards 1992, has decided to look into developing opportunities for undertaking work in France, in partnership with a French architectural firm that has plenty of work at the moment. The three partners hope that from this evening's session they will emerge leaner, fitter and ready to take on any improvement in the construction sector. 'We'll certainly be leaner and fitter, whatever happens,' says Tom, sweeping the credit-card pieces into the bin, reflecting dolefully on his lost access to lost lunches. Later that night, the Plowshares - Alison, John and Toby  - gather around the kitchen table to discuss the matter. Toby casts a sideways look at his harassed father, and asks with apparent innocence: 'What are you going to do about the cars? I don't suppose you can afford those any more.' 'We didn't talk about the cars, actually,' John replies, through gritted teeth. The cars, most beloved of the company toys that the partners have invested in, should go, on the advice of Mr Ledger. 'The leases are too new to have any value, but you would be wise to get rid of them and downgrade your cars to something cheaper, particularly now that the Budget has increased the tax burden for company cars,' says Mr Ledger. 'It's a short-term move, but it would really help cash-flow. And, with the new tax, get rid of these mobile phones if you really want to save money.' Banished to using a phone box and driving a Mini, John grows philosophical. That night, before turning out the kitchen light, John takes one last look at his car parked outside the house. 'Ah well,' he reflects, 'no central-locking, winding up the windows. . . It'll be good exercise for me, at least.' Help in compiling this feature, in which all the characters are imaginary, was provided by the RlBA London Region and Michael Sampson, of accountants Sampson West.</p>

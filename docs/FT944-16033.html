			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Heseltine leads business visit to Malaysia Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, left London yesterday for the first visit to Kuala Lumpur by a cabinet minister since Malaysia ended a seven-month trade dispute. The visit marks a significant warming of the relationship between London and Kuala Lumpur, which was deeply strained by British newspaper reports of attempts by UK companies to bribe Malaysian officials. In a sign of the importance attached to the trip by the government, Mr Heseltine was accompanied by a big group of senior businesspeople from manufacturing, construction and service companies. He will meet several Malaysian ministers for talks, including Dr Mahathir Mohamad, prime minister, Mr Anwar Ibrahim, deputy prime minister, and Mr Rafidah Aziz, trade minister. Mr Heseltine said the visit was intended 'to explore ways in which we can build on our existing relationship by identifying new areas of co-operation'. Malaysia gave no reasons for its decision five weeks ago to end its ban on government contracts for UK companies. The embargo is believed to have caused substantial damage to British businesses. The ban excluded companies such as GEC, Balfour Beatty and Trafalgar House from bidding for potentially lucrative contracts for South East Asia's largest infrastructure project, an international airport south of Kuala Lumpur. British bidders were also excluded from tendering for some contracts in Malaysia's power sector and for some construction projects. The ban did not prevent British companies from continuing to bid for private-sector business. The businessmen travelling to Malaysia include Dr Terry Harrison, chief executive of Rolls-Royce; Sir Colin Chandler, chairman of Vickers; Sir Robin Biggam, chairman of BICC; Sir John Banham, chairman of Tarmac; Mr Douglas Gadd, chairman of GEC Alsthom; and Mr Martin Laing, chairman of John Laing. Mr Heseltine said: 'The Far East market is a real test for the competitiveness of British companies. The opportunities are there. We must seize them before other countries do.' Britain's relations with Malaysia had been difficult even before the trade dispute as Dr Mahathir followed a 'buy British last' policy for almost a decade in retaliation against increases in fees for foreign students at UK universities.</p>

			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / UK Gilts: Post-election rally gains fresh vigour THE GILT market's surging post-election rally, stalled recently by concerns about rising headline inflation and the overhang of new gilt issuance, was back on the rails again by the end of last week. A batch of important data due out this week could help the market to continue to power ahead. The April retail price index was looming large in the minds of investors in UK government bonds last week. Most had agreed that the year-on-year rate, when reported, would be well up on the 4 per cent of March - though there were differing views on just how sharp the rise would be. One-off factors accounted for much of the expected jump: last year's reduction in the community charge (or 'poll tax') dropped out of the calculation, together with the reduction in mortgage rates last year by  3/4 percentage point. Together, these two factors would add 2 1/4 points to the inflation rate, according to Greenwell Montagu. In the event, year-on-year inflation came in at 4.3 per cent - close to the bottom of the range of expectations, and well below some alarmist predictions that put it close to 5 per cent. The news set the stage for the expected announcement of Pounds 850m of 'tap' stock from the Bank of England. The Bank has issued some Pounds 7bn of gilts since the general election at the beginning of April and sold perhaps another Pounds 2bn from its own book. That still leaves more than Pounds 20bn of gilts to sell before the end of the fiscal year - but the market on Friday was not letting that disturb it, and took the news of the latest tap issue confidently in its stride. The tap stock was concentrated in the 10 to 15-year areas of the the yield curve, a maturity at which the Bank has issued little paper recently. (Its last auction, and the only one of the fiscal year to date, was its extra-long dated issue.) The three largest tranches, each of Pounds 250m, are the 9 3/4 per cent Treasury stock due 2002; the 9 1/2 per cent conversion stock due 2005; and the 9 per cent Treasury loan maturing 2008. There was also a small, Pounds 100m tranche of short-dated paper, the 9 per cent Treasury loan due 1994. It is this end of the yield curve that has seen the best advances, and which is likely to see further gains in the days ahead. The yield curve has already steepened marginally, and could develop an even more marked inversion. The Bank of England has made clear that interest rate cuts are out of the question until inflation falls further. Three-month money in London spent last week hovering just above 10 per cent as a result, and is not expected to come down in the forseeable future. Indeed, a more likely challenge is whether sterling could sustain its current firm position without a hike in interest rates, should the Bundesbank be forced to take action to raise German rates in the coming weeks. For longer-dated gilts, economic data due this week is generally expected to remain positive. Tuesday sees the release of industrial production data for March, while Thursday brings the latest money supply statistics. The figures are likely to show that manufacturing output fell by 0.5 percentage point in March, according to Philip Tyson, an economist at Warburg Securities. That, and soft money supply figures, could set the scene for further price gains.</p>

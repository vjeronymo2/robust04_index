			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FISHING NOTES;  </P> <P> ANGLERS WILL FIND ACTION HEATING UP  </P> <P> There will be plenty of deep-sea action over the Memorial Day weekend as  anglers choose the species they would like to try for.  </P> <P> The outlook is for an abundance of fish to be caught.  </P> <P> At Rocky Point, party boats and private boats will find the three Bs: bass,  bonito and barracuda. The Horseshoe has been yielding some good-size calico  bass. Barracuda are among the missing at Horseshoe because of fluctuating water  temperatures.  </P> <P> Catalina Island fishing remains excellent with barracuda and white sea bass at  the west end of the island.  </P> <P> Yellowtail weighing more than 20 pounds have been caught from the kelp patties.  Anglers are using live squid for bait with light line, but have lost some  good-size yellows. It takes up to 30-pound tests to hold the big ones that head  back into the kelp after being hooked.  </P> <P> Earl Vanal of Santa Monica, fishing aboard the Sumo in Santa Monica Bay, was  sure he hooked a yellowtail. He reeled and followed his fish from bow to stern  for 15 minutes, but when it came close to the surface it was a big bonito,  probably the largest caught this spring at 12 pounds.  </P> <P> Kelp pattie hopping: Aboard the boat Instinct 30 miles from Point Loma, five  South Bay fishermen had full limits of yellowtail, although the size of the  fish averaged only 10-16 pounds.  </P> <P> Leon Campazzie of Torrance landed a 16-pounder, Bob Gifford of Torrance a  15-pounder and Paul Friedman of Hermosa Beach a 15-pounder. Phil Friedman, the  voice of 976-TUNA, had a 15-pounder and Martin Thompson of Manhattan Beach had  a 12-pounder.  </P> <P> Stan and Celinda Woodward of King Harbor Marlin Club returned last week from  Cabo San Lucas. Stan weighed in a 372-pound black marlin while Celinda brought  aboard a 105-pound sailfish.  </P></p>

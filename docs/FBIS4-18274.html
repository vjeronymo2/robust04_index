			<p>BFN     [Text] After his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher in Washington, Spanish Foreign Minister  Javier Solana underlined the normality of relations between the  United States and Spain.    Solana said that during their meeting they covered the  international situation and more specifically the situation in  Bosnia and the EU [European Union] enlargement process.    Solana underlined that the Spanish Government is very  concerned with the reconstruction process in Bosnia. Solana  briefed Christopher about the EU enlargement process and added  that the recent agreement concerning minority voting rights is a  balanced compromise that allows the defense of Spain's  interests.    Furthermore, Solana -- who is traveling on to Egypt and  Lebanon next week -- said that the latest events in the Middle  East meant that the peace process was going to go through a  difficult phase.    Solana and Christopher also discussed various Latin American  issues.    In his statements to the press in Washington, Solana said  that the Spanish Government is awaiting an official announcement  from the Algerian Government about its apparent decision to  extend its territorial waters to 53 miles and to increase  pressure on foreign boats fishing illegally in its waters.    The Spanish foreign minister underlined that there is no  actual or specific Algerian document saying what this means and  that he would rather not comment until an official declaration  from the Algerian Government was available. Then, he added, we  will give an appropriate answer.    Meanwhile, Vincente Albero, the Spanish agriculture,  fisheries, and food minister, said that although the government  was awaiting more information about the measure, it had told the  European Commission about Algeria's decision to extend its  territorial waters toward the Spanish coast.</p>

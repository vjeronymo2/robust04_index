			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Ukraine energy chief loses job President Leonid Kuchma yesterday dismissed Ukraine's senior energy official for failing to make payments on arrears of Dollars 713.5m (Pounds 457m) owed for gas supplies from Turkmenistan. By sacking Mr Mykhailo Kovalko, chairman of the state oil and gas committee, Mr Kuchma sent a strong signal, both to his own bureaucracy and to the west, that he is serious about pursuing the radical economic reforms he unveiled in the autumn. Ukraine has won substantial foreign aid to back these reforms, much of it earmarked to help pay for the fuel it receives from Russia and Turkmenistan. Mr Kuchma accused Mr Kovalko of failing to make payments due under a seven-year debt rescheduling agreement Ukraine reached with Turkmenistan last month. Kiev has since paid Turkmenistan Dollars 41m, using some of the Dollars 371m in aid from the International Monetary Fund. Ukraine also owes Russia about Dollars 1.4bn, much of it to Gazprom. The Russian gas giant has no choice but to supply Ukraine because 97 per cent of its gas exports flow through a Ukrainian pipeline - a serious defect in the eyes of potential western investors. Mr Kuchma has insisted that he will not tolerate corruption in the potentially lucrative energy sector.</p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Healthcare Holdings talks off Healthcare Holdings, an owner and operator of hospitals, has invited its bankers to appoint a receiver after talks with a third party failed to produce an offer for it. The company had said on January 28 that it had entered into non-binding heads of agreement with a third party on a recommended offer. It said yesterday that no final agreement had been reached. The directors of Healthcare said that after lengthy discussions with all parties the board had concluded that there was no longer any reasonable prospect of completing a deal which would safeguard the interests of creditors and preserve value for shareholders. Shares in Healthcare were suspended in January at the company's request, and publication of the results for the 18 months to June 30 1993 was delayed pending the outcome of restructuring talks. Mr Paul Jarrett and Mr James Hughes have resigned as directors, but will provide assistance to the receiver.</p>

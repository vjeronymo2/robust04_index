			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Ford halts production at two plants for a week FORD is to halt all car and van production at two of its three UK assembly plants next week because of recession in the UK new vehicle market and weakening continental sales. There will be no production of Fiestas at Dagenham, Essex, or of Transit vans at Southampton. For the rest of November, Dagenham will be on a three-day week, while Southampton, where production was halted for the whole of last week, will be on a four-day week. The production cuts are the most severe that Ford, the country's leading vehicle maker, has imposed since the summer, when it had to take urgent action to trim output and excess stocks after disappointing sales in August  -the most important month for new car sales in the UK. The announcement of the latest production cuts in the UK came as Ford disclosed in the US yesterday that it had returned to loss on its worldwide operations in the third quarter with a deficit of Dollars 159m (Pounds 101m), compared with a net profit of Dollars 840m in the first half of the year. Ford's US automotive operations incurred a loss of Dollars 153m in the third quarter, while its European automotive operations plunged to a deficit of Dollars 479m with continuing heavy losses at Jaguar, Ford's UK luxury car subsidiary, and a sharp fall at Ford of Britain. Mr Harold Poling, Ford chairman, warned that the uncertainty resulting from instability in European currency markets had led to lower sales in most of Ford's European markets. Combined west European new car and truck sales were running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of only 14.4m in the third quarter of 1992 against a sales rate of 15.1m in each of the first two quarters, the company said. In the UK, Ford was forced to cut production at its Halewood Merseyside plant in the last two weeks of August. This was followed by the start of three and four-day working week in September at the Dagenham and Southampton plants. Production cuts announced yesterday will affect about 5,500 workers at Dagenham and 1,800 at Southampton. Output of about 10,800 Fiestas will be lost at Dagenham in the four weeks from November 2. Ford of Britain is currently seeking to negotiate with the unions a cut in lay-off pay to 60 per cent of the present level of basic wage until the end of 1994. Ford announced last month that it would cut a further 1,550 jobs by the end of 1992 in the UK, and warned union officials that it had 'half an assembly plant too much capacity'. Elsewhere in Europe, Ford has cut production significantly in Belgium in recent months, and this month it announced a programme of non-production days at assembly plants in Valencia, Spain, and Cologne, Germany.

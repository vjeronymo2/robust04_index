			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Yeltsin pushing for special IMF treatment PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin of Russia is using the acclaim he received from last week's deal on nuclear arms cuts with the US to persuade foreign governments to press the International Monetary Fund to treat Russia as a special case. This would mean allowing it access to Dollars 24bn (Pounds 12.9bn) in aid even though its economic reform programme does not observe IMF conditions. Mr Yeltsin told reporters in Ottawa, Canada, on Saturday that he would try to persuade the leaders of the Group of Seven industrial countries, whom he will meet in Munich early next month, to 'throw their weight behind persuading the IMF into opening the Dollars 24bn credit line'. He said that because of the effects of communism and the consequent difficulty of the transition to democracy and free markets, 'the standard IMF project should not be applied to us to the letter'. Mr Yeltsin's statement sets the stage for an unprecedented struggle between the IMF, whose officials are concluding talks with government ministers in Moscow, and the Russian government - with the G7 leaders invited to take one side or another. The talks between the Fund and Russia are said to be going badly, and an agreement before the G7 meeting with Mr Yeltsin in Munich on July 8 is unlikely. The IMF wants to apply the same criteria to Russia as it does to other member countries. It is thus holding Russia to account for rising budget deficits, for its decision to hold down energy prices, for the Rbs2 trillion (million million) debt which state enterprises have accumulated and for the non-payment of principal and interest on its more than Dollars 60bn foreign debt. Though Mr Yeltsin proclaimed his commitment to market reform on his trip to the US and Canada last week, the government sends a different message in Moscow, acknowledging it is moderating its policies in response to public and industrial pressure. An article in the Nezavisimaya Gazeta last Thursday, written by a senior government adviser under a pseudonym, makes clear that the cabinet 'reformers' have made a strategic alliance with the 'industrialists', who now have three representatives in the cabinet. The government accepts that this will blunt the radicalism of its programme and require more subsidies and a slower pace, but has been forced to conclude it because it needs support from those who control production and believes they too are interested in market reform, albeit in a more measured way. At the same time, worsening economic indices are narrowing the government's options. Figures published last week show a drop in exports of around 5 per cent in the first four months of 1992, compared with the same period last year. Grain purchases of 13.8m tonnes show a 75 per cent increase. on last year, according to official figures.</p>

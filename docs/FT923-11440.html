			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Ian Maxwell resists damages demand MR IAN MAXWELL went to the High Court yesterday to oppose an application by the liquidator of Bishopsgate Investment Management for immediate judgment on its Pounds 450m damages claim against him. The liquidator, Robson Rhodes, contends that Mr Maxwell, a son of Robert Maxwell, has no defence to its allegations that he breached his fiduciary duty as a director of BIM, from which hundreds of millions of pounds of Maxwell companies' pension funds are missing. Mr Maxwell's lawyers are contending at the private hearing, which continues today, that he has an arguable defence justifying the dispute going to a full trial. On Monday the liquidator was granted final judgment in an identical claim against Mr Kevin Maxwell, brother of Mr Ian Maxwell, who was ordered to make interim payments totalling Pounds 406.5m pending assessment of his total liability. Mr Kevin Maxwell did not defend the liquidator's claim because of lack of resources. Earlier this month he said he was insolvent and wanted time to formulate proposals to put to his creditors. The liquidator intends forcing him into bankruptcy. It is expected to do the same to Mr Ian Maxwell if it succeeds in its claim for final judgment against him. Both brothers face criminal charges arising from an investigation of their father's empire by the Serious Fraud Office.</p>

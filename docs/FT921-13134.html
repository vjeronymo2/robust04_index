			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Lower sales and earnings at enlarged Borland Intl BORLAND International, the US personal computer software company, reported a decline in sales and flat earnings for its third quarter, following the completion of its acquisition of Ashton-Tate, another US software company. Results for the third quarter were reported on a 'pooling-of-interests' basis, in which the results of the merged company are compared to the accumulative results of both companies last year. Revenues were Dollars 114.6m (Pounds 64m), a 6.6 per cent decrease compared with Dollars 122.7m for the same period a year ago, the quarter ending in December for Borland but ending in September for Ashton-Tate. Borland noted that in its 1990 third quarter Ashton-Tate's sales were buoyed by the introduction of a new product. Net income was Dollars 7.5m, or 28 cents per share, compared with Dollars 6.8m last time. Borland took a Dollars 6m charge against third quarter earnings in connection with the merger, bringing total pre-tax transaction and restructuring charges over the past nine months to Dollars 116m. The company also benefited from a Dollars 7m tax credit, also related to the Ashton-Tate acquisition. Revenues for the nine month period were Dollars 365.7m, up some 14 per cent from Dollars 321.4m. The company reported a net loss of Dollars 83.5m, or Dollars 3.42 per share, including restructuring and transaction charges, compared with a net income of Dollars 2m or 8 cents per share, for the same period a year ago.</p>

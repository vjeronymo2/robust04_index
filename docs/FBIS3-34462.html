In the communique issued Tuesday in Khartoum in response to  the U.S. accusations, the Sudanese Foreign Ministry stressed the  United States double standards, noting that while the United  States was referring to imaginary military operations in  southern Sudan, it maintained total silence on Israel's deadly  operations in the occupied territories. The communique stressed  that the military operations in southern Sudan were nothing but  fighting between rebel factions and that the people's armed  forces only fired in cases of legitimate defense.    The communique also confirmed the commitment of the Sudanese  Government to all the agreements on humanitarian aid, including  those signed with the United Nations, which stipulate the  facilitation of the transport of relief material to war victims  in southern Sudan.    The United States' support for the rebel movement and for  its  springboard and these unfounded accusations were phenomena which  could encourage the rebel movement to escalate the war and to  reject all initiatives designed to achieve a peaceful solution  to the problem in southern Sudan, the communique said.</p>

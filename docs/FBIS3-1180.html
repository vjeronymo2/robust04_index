Speaking at a Johannesburg business breakfast meeting, Mr  Buthelezi said the interim constitution contained "all the  unwanted baggage of the past -- the excesses of central  government, a limited bill of rights and a politically malleable  constitutional court".    The whole system remained top heavy and would continue the  autocratic and authoritarian characteristics of the present  government. The new provinces would not have a say on  provincial matters such as civil service, police, audits,  budgeting and finance, he said.    While the South African business community seemed complacent  about the interim constitution, Mr Buthelezi said he was  prepared to accept criticism for not taking part in the coming  elections.    International mediation by constitutional experts would show  the IFP's demands as fair and its concerns as legitimate, he  said.    Mediation would address the question of Zulu  self-determination and the status of the Zulu kingdom. It would  help rationalise the electoral process and timetables so all  parties could compete on an equal footing.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The absence of a training grant definition has led to disagreements between the Department and grant recipients over whether the training rate of eight percent, which is a lower rate than most recipients' negotiated rate, should be applied to certain grants. The proposed definition will alleviate this problem and improve the Department's ability to effectively administer these grants. Similarly, ambiguities in existing regulations on the use of indirect costs for matching or cost-sharing and on the reimbursement of indirect costs to groups of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible parties has contributed to administrative problems between the Department and its grant recipients. The proposed changes will clarify for all parties how these special situations are to be handled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The existing regulations in these sections are being revised and reorganized and new sections are being added. Specifically, the following sections are proposed for revision or addition:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 75.129_This section is revised to include a reference to a new requirement in &sect;75.564 on the determination of indirect costs for a grant to a group of eligible parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 75.560_This section is revised to include the requirements that a grantee claiming indirect costs must have a current indirect cost rate agreement, that the Secretary may establish a temporary indirect cost rate under certain circumstances, and that the Secretary may establish a restricted indirect cost rate for a grantee to satisfy the regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of certain programs administered by the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 75.561_This section is revised to clarify the approval period for indirect cost rates established by the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 75.562_This section is revised and expanded to include a definition of a training grant, a statement that the Secretary decides which grants are training grants, a clarification of the base to which the training rate is applied, and a restatement of the existing requirement that indirect costs in excess of the eight percent limitation may not be charged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly or be used to satisfy matching or cost-sharing requirements. It also explains that a grantee must have documentation available to show that its negotiated indirect cost rate is at least eight percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 75.563_This section is revised to refer grantees subject to a restricted indirect cost rate to the new sections in part 76 on restricted rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections 75.564 through 75.568 are removed in order to transfer these sections on restricted indirect cost rates to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part 76. Since most grants under restricted rate programs are made to agencies of State or local governments, or their subgrantees, the Secretary is proposing this change to clarify the applicability of these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 75.564_This is a new section that includes several requirements applicable to the reimbursement of indirect costs, including clarification on the use of indirect costs to satisfy matching or cost-sharing requirements and the reimbursement of indirect costs under a grant to a group of eligible parties. The exclusion of certain categories of grants from reimbursement for indirect costs is proposed, since these types of grants have very little overhead or administrative costs associated with them. This exclusion is consistent with the current policy of the Department of Health and Human Services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 76.560_This section is revised to include the requirements that a grantee claiming indirect costs must have a current indirect cost rate agreement, that the Secretary may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish a temporary indirect cost rate under certain circumstances, and that the Secretary may establish a restricted indirect cost rate for a grantee to satisfy the statutory requirements of certain programs administered by the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 76.563 is revised to indicate the new sections in part 76 that apply to grantees subject to a restricted indirect cost rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 76.564_This new section incorporates the provisions of the current &sect;75.564 and also includes the requirement that indirect costs not recovered as a result of the restrictions may not be charged directly or charged to other Federal awards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 76.565_This new section incorporates the provisions of the current &sect;75.565. The term ``general management costs'' is substituted for ``administrative charges'' to avoid confusion with the latter term as it is used in other regulations. The section explains that the term general management costs includes some occupancy and space maintenance costs. It also clarifies what is meant by the terms ``chief executive officer,'' which is used in place of ``chief administrative officer,'' and ``component'' as these terms are used in this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 76.566_This new section incorporates the provisions of the current &sect;75.566 and clarifies which fringe benefits may be used in determining fixed costs in a restricted rate calculation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

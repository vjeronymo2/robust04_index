			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Gold price rises to highest level since Gulf war: Sir James Goldsmith's sale of Newmont Mining shares starts surge THE PRICE of gold, driven by New York investment fund activity, rose sharply again yesterday to close in London at Dollars 390 a troy ounce, its highest level since the Gulf war 30 months ago. Share prices of gold mining companies worldwide followed the precious metal upwards. The latest gold surge started on Wednesday after Sir James Goldsmith, the international financier, announced he was to sell another big block of shares in Newmont Mining, North America's largest gold producer, and buy gold bullion instead. Gold moved up Dollars 5.25 an ounce on Thursday in London and rose another Dollars 6.50 yesterday. Some analysts, however, suggested that gold's rise had more to do with the rains which have prevented soya beans being sown across a wide area of the US. This caused the US Commodity Research Bureau's futures index, seen by New York investment funds as an indicator of future inflation, to move up quickly, triggering a move into gold and silver as a hedge against inflation. In New York, however, the gold price fell back on aggressive profit-taking ahead of the Independence Day weekend. The Comex August contract fell Dollars 1.50 to Dollars 386.70 after touching Dollars 393.60. 'All gold activity is being caused by New York futures markets and the speculative funds,' said Mr Andy Smith, analyst at the Union Bank of Switzerland. 'There is no demand for gold bullion at these prices, particularly in the Far East.' Nevertheless, Sir James will be pleased with his campaign. The publicity he gave to his sale of Newmont shares to financier Mr George Soros in April revived the gold market. He used some of the proceeds from Mr Soros's funds to buy call options, helping to push up the gold price which in January was languishing at a seven-year low of Dollars 327 an ounce. He sold more Newmont shares and the price rallied. Analysts suggest that, if he used only half the Dollars 440m (Pounds 293.30m) he can expect from the next sale of Newmont shares to buy more options, it would push the gold price through the psychologically-important Dollars 400 level. Meanwhile, the Newmont share price, which normally would have fallen because 9.65m shares are on offer, instead improved by Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 57 1/8 at the close of New York trading yesterday. Sir James bought his shares for Dollars 39 each. When the next sale is completed, he will have reduced his Newmont holding from about 45 per cent to only 5 per cent. Some analysts warned of the dangers inherent in a speculative gold rally. 'At what point do the funds turn from buyers to sellers?' one asked.

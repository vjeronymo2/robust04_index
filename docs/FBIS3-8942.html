			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 12 (CTK) -- Vladimir Meciar, the  architect of Slovakia's independence and for three years the  most popular Slovak politician, has become a victim of a  "Czechoslovakist, communist and Hungarian conspiracy," the  pro-government daily REPUBLIKA writes today, commenting on a  no-confidence vote in Meciar's government passed by Slovak  Parliament on Friday [11 March].    Peoples' fears of "what is going to happen with us Slovaks"  are justified, the author of the commentary and the paper's  editor-in-chief Jan Smolec writes. Politicians who did not move  a finger for the independent Slovakia seized power, he adds.    The daily outlines a pessimistic picture of Slovakia's  future  after the "dismissal" of the "beloved" premier. Peter Weiss,  chairman of the opposition Democratic Left Party (SDL), "an heir  of the communists from whom we have not heard one word of  sincere declaration to the people will now influence the life of  society," the paper says. It gives also the name of another  "accomplice" in the conspiracy -- Chairman of the Christian  Democratic Movement (KDH) Jan Carnogursky who "voted against  Slovakia's independence." "While the Slovak Metropolitan  Archbishop Jan Sokol was praying for independence a Christian  politician voted against it," says REPUBLIKA, alluding to  Carnogursky.    These people together with "extreme separatists" will likely  to lead Slovakia back to "Czechoslovakist or other dangerous  waters. But we will not surrender. The fight for Slovakia  continues," Smolec concludes.</p>

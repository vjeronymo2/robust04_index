These donations were guaranteed under Agreement PL-480,  which many Salvadoran farmers have criticized, because they  believe it dispenses with incentives for national production.    The minister has said the decline is due to food security.  "El Salvador had the best corn, bean, and millet [maicillo]  harvest in the country's history during 1992," Cabrales has  said, adding the agricultural improvement was due to "the  government's faith in the social market economy and the  elimination of price distortions."    According to the minister, food production in El Salvador  had  dropped 12 percent at the end of the 1980's, and food imports  had increased 60 percent. "For example, we had a deficit of  more than 600,000 quintals of beans in 1989, and rice producers  had threatened they would not plant, because donations had  affected them very much," Cabrales has said.    Within the government's food security program, Cabrales  spotlighted the importance of eliminating price controls and  closing down the Institute of Supply Regulation (IRA).  Likewise, the minister has announced during the four years of  the administration, the ministry's size had been reduced from  7,000 employees to 3,500.    According to an August 1993 UN Food and Agriculture  Organization (FAO) report, El Salvador is second in Latin  America in cereal production per capita. Ecuador holds first  place.</p>

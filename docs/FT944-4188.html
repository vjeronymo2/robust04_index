			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Warburg's choice SG Warburg has always looked the UK merchant bank most likely to succeed in the fiercely competitive global investment banking business. Its decision to accept the status of junior partner in a proposed merger with US investment house Morgan Stanley will thus be seen as a blow to the prestige of the British-owned merchant banking fraternity. Yet it is hard to see how Warburg could win a lasting place at the top if it continued to go it alone. For while it has long been the most internationally-minded of merchant banks, it has signally failed, over decades, to make convincing inroads into the world's tougher markets, most notably the US. That is not to decry the achievements of Warburg's management. The successful completion of the merger of the separate broking, jobbing and merchant banking businesses of Rowe &amp; Pitman, Mullens, Akroyd &amp; Smithers and SG Warburg at the time of the Big Bang was a remarkable achievement. Equally striking has been Warburg's strength in the rapidly growing cross-border financial business and in a wide range of domestic activities. Yet the figures fail to impress if measured by the highest standards. The net income of Warburg's potential partner, Morgan Stanley, grew around seven-fold from before the firm's flotation in the mid-1980s to Dollars 731m last year. Over the same period its capital rose more than fourteen-fold from Dollars 314m to Dollars 4.5bn. In dollar terms, Warburg's post-tax profits rose from Dollars 86m to Dollars 280m betweem 1986 and the end of 1993, while its capital increased only four and a half times from Dollars 509m to Dollars 2.3bn. Morgan has lost some of its edge since the early 1980s and has suffered defections. But in a global game where a capital of Dollars 5bn is probably the minimum entry fee, it was still in with a chance. While the figures are not wholly comparable, Warburg has clearly found the going tougher. Yet its preferred solution should not give cause for concern about the City's international competitiveness. The readiness of Deutsche Bank and others to locate much of their capital market activity in London reflects the very opposite of the branch plant syndrome. Within the European time zone, London still has most to offer and has seen substantial jobs growth since Big Bang, much of it in foreign firms. Part of London's strength has precisely been its openness to foreigners, as the names of British merchant banks so eloquently attest. It is nonetheless worth asking why one of the best managed British banks has failed make it to the very top. Wall Street firms enjoy an undeniable advantage in the size of their domestic corporate sector. Yet Morgan Stanley had less capital than Warburg in the mid-1980s and has outgrown it by a huge margin. Warburg, meantime, failed to pull off a merger with Kuhn Loeb in the 1960s, an alliance with Paribas in the 1970s or to make a success of the joint acquisition with Paribas of US commercial paper firm AG Becker later in the 1970s. That inevitably raises questions about the attempt to resolve a strategic problem via a merger. Management cultures in banking rarely mix well. Cross-border alliances in this area have, in the main, been fraught. The wider question is whether the fully integrated global investment banking game, which is increasingly dependent on low-grade trading profits, is worth the candle. Warburg's founding genius, Sir Siegmund Warburg, had little doubt that small was best.</p>

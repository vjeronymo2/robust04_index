			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S. AFRICA, ANC TO RESCHEDULE STALLED TALKS  </P> <P> In discussions between South Africa's two most important opponents, President  Frederik W. de Klerk and African National Congress Deputy President Nelson R.  Mandela agreed Thursday night to reschedule talks that had been suspended by  the ANC in protest over police killings of black demonstrators.  </P> <P> The peace process "is on course again," De Klerk declared after a three-hour  meeting with Mandela at the presidential offices. It was the first formal  contact between a free ANC leader and a South African president in at least  three decades.  </P> <P> Mandela, at a separate news conference, described the meeting as "cordial,  pleasant . . . and productive. We think, broadly speaking, we have been able to  make very good progress and we are hopeful further meetings also will be  productive."  </P> <P> Mandela and De Klerk, each assisted by three senior aides, agreed on a new date  for initial ANC-government talks. The ANC said the date will be announced as  soon as Mandela reports back to the ANC's national executive committee in  Lusaka, Zambia.  </P> <P> The two sides also agreed to open formal channels of communication that would,  in De Klerk's words, "eliminate misunderstandings" between the ANC and the  government in the future. Neither De Klerk nor Mandela would specify what those  arrangements entailed.  </P> <P> The ANC's efforts to unify anti-apartheid forces for eventual negotiations also  were bolstered Thursday when four of the six leaders of South Africa's  self-governing black homelands pulled out of separate talks with De Klerk, and  the leader of one of the country's four nominally independent black homelands,  Venda, was overthrown in a military coup.  </P> <P> Only two homeland leaders -- Kwazulu chief minister Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi  and Qwaqwa chief minister Kenneth Mopeli -- turned up for their scheduled  meeting with De Klerk. The government accused the ANC of intimidating the other  homeland leaders, and De Klerk criticized Mandela, saying that "no leader  should in any way whatsoever try to inhibit discussion."  </P> <P> "There is no way I'm going to be intimidated by any bullying," said Buthelezi,  whose supporters have been engaged in a bloody war with the ANC-aligned United  Democratic Front in Natal province. And Buthelezi said that "just because I'm  here," meeting with De Klerk, doesn't mean "I'm aligning myself with the  government."  </P> <P> Mandela denied any ANC intimidation of the homeland leaders, contending that  the four leaders had already made up their minds to boycott talks with De Klerk  when they briefed the ANC on Wednesday.  </P> <P> The resurrected government-ANC talks, originally scheduled for next Thursday,  will center on obstacles to formal negotiations. The ANC has refused to accept  De Klerk's invitation to negotiate a new constitution until the government  lifts the 46-month-old state of emergency, releases political prisoners, ends  political prosecutions and allows exiles free passage home.  </P> <P> The ANC, the primary black opposition group in South Africa, had suspended  arrangements for those preliminary talks in protest over a March 26 clash  between police and demonstrators in Sebokeng, about 25 miles south of  Johannesburg. Police opened fire on tens of thousands of blacks protesting poor  living conditions in that township, killing five. At least 10 other deaths  occurred in rioting and additional clashes with police later that day.  </P> <P> The ANC had demanded a government response to the "massacre of innocent and  defenseless people in Sebokeng."  </P> <P> De Klerk met that demand Thursday by assuring Mandela that he had already  ordered "an in-depth investigation" into the police actions in Sebokeng. The  president also said he would consider appointing a judicial commission of  inquiry into the deaths.  </P> <P> Mandela said he welcomed De Klerk's moves but added that he had told the  president that any commission of inquiry "must consist of people regarded as  credible leaders" in the black community. "The perception that exists,  especially among blacks in the country, is that a white judge is not the right  person to head such an inquiry."  </P> <P> It was the first meeting of the two leaders since Mandela was released from  prison Feb. 11. They conferred twice while Mandela was a prisoner.  </P> <P> Mandela was joined in the discussions by Popo Molefe, general secretary of the  UDF anti-apartheid coalition; Trevor Manuel, ANC leader in the western Cape  province, and Ahmed Kathrada, a Mandela co-defendant in the 1964 treason trial  and now part of the ANC's internal leadership.  </P> <P> De Klerk was assisted by Roelof F. (Pik) Botha, the foreign minister; Gerrit  Viljoen, minister of constitutional development, and Adriaan Vlok, minister of  law and order.  </P> <P> The two sides agreed that escalating violence across the country, especially in  Natal province where factional fighting has claimed more than 2,500 lives in  the last three years, is a major impediment to fruitful black-white  negotiations.  </P> <P> But they disagreed about the cause of that violence. De Klerk suggested that  much of it was spawned by the ANC's refusal to end its support for the armed  struggle it has waged against Pretoria's white minority-led government for 30  years.  </P> <P> The ANC contends that the armed struggle cannot be ended until the government  stops using violence against anti-apartheid demonstrators. And Mandela blamed  the violence in South Africa on the system of racial repression that has left  the black majority impoverished and frustrated.  </P> <P> The government's desire to open power-sharing talks with black opposition  groups has triggered increasing violence in South Africa's 10 homelands, which  were created under apartheid to keep blacks away from white areas. Many  residents of the four homelands that Pretoria considers independent are  pressing their leaders to return the territories to South African rule.  </P> <P> A coup last month toppled the leader of Ciskei, one of the four independent  homelands. And on Thursday, Venda President Frank Ravele, the leader of another  of those independent homelands, was overthrown.  </P> <P> News of the coup was greeted with singing and dancing in the streets, news  agencies reported. In an address on Radio Thohoyandou, coup leader Col. Gabriel  Ramushwana, deputy chief of the Venda Defense Force, said he would lead the  2,578-square-mile territory until it is incorporated into South Africa.  </P> <P> "It is quite clear these (homeland) leaders have no support," Mandela said. And  while the ANC is willing to forget the past, he warned that "discredited  homeland leaders" who are attempting to maintain their power despite public  disapproval "will not be able to run to us for protection."  </P></p>

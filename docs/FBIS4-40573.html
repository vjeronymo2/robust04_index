			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Pavel Kuznestov, Gennadiy </F> Kulbitskiy, Gennadiy Temnenkov]    [Text] Bonn June 16 TASS -- Chairman of the Russian State  Duma Ivan Rybkin who is on an official visit to Germany as the  head of a delegation of the lower house of the Russian  parliament, met with journalists in Bonn on Thursday.    "We have agreed with our German colleagues to develop close  contacts between committees of the State Duma and the German  Bundestag which deal with economic issues. I believe that  Bundestag's experience in this field will be of great interest  for us, especially in matters concerning the economic boost on  Germany's eastern lands," Rybkin said.    He pointed out that during his talks with German leaders on  Thursday the sides touched upon problems faced by Germans  residing in Russia and Russians in Germany. "We must do our  best so that hundreds of thousands of these people could feel at  home both in Russia and in Germany," Rybkin said.    Touching upon problems existing in Russo-German relations,  Rybkin singled out the problem of mutual return of cultural  values, removed from Russia and Germany as a result of the  Second World War, as the most difficult one.    Asked about the interaction between the Russian president  and  the State Duma and the extent to which the lower house of the  Russian parliament supports the course of reforms pursued by  Boris Yeltsin, Rybkin said that "from the very first days of our  existence we have been acting together with the president and  shall continue to do so in future to find a way out of the  quagmire of the crisis".</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Midlands boosts Soviet region in barter deals OFFICIALS from the gas-rich Tyumen region of western Siberia are touring the UK Midlands this week, examining the plants providing them with goods in a series of cash and barter deals set up by Orbicom, a company based in Shrewsbury, Shropshire. The deals are based on a traditional pattern. Raw materials and a limited amount of hard currency come from the Soviet Union in exchange for capital projects and goods needed to raise living standards there. Mr Mark Jones, Orbicom chairman, is working on the basis that to consider the Soviet Union as a unified market is an illusion. In his view, it is necessary to take seriously the Gorbachev reforms, most notably the movement to greater regional autonomy. But barter trade continues to attract those interested in the Soviet market. Despite the gradual opening of the Soviet market, 'the rouble is subject to arbitrary manipulation,' Mr Jones said. Given the Soviet Union is perennially short of hard currency, trade profits for western businessmen have to be earned in other ways. Orbicom's business splits into two parts, each with gas as the base and springing out of the relationship Mr Jones has developed with Neftekhimkombinat, the publicly-owned petrochemical company based in Tobolsk, a city of 260,000 people in Tyumen. The first part is long term. Orbicom has negotiated with Neftekhimkombinat the heads of an agreement for a joint venture to establish a gas fractionation unit. This takes gas and splits it into different fractions - methane, propane and so on. The cost would be Pounds 80m. Of that sum, Pounds 20m would come in the form of hard currency-spending on plant and equipment. The balance would come in sales from the new plant. This is orthodox project financing of a type common in natural resource exploitation for 20 years. But the difficulty comes both in obtaining the export credit guarantees on the sale of the plant and in obtaining the project finance from banks which remain cautious about Soviet joint ventures. The second part of the Orbicom business hinges around the sales price for propane gas. Orbicom is taking from Neftekhimkombinat a series of propane gas shipments, despatched through the port of Riga. Five shipments have been delivered; one is being loaded at the port. The value of these could reach Pounds 15m. In return, Orbicom is setting up a maternity hospital, said to be the first in the Soviet Union to meet UK Department of Health standards, under a scheme to boost health services in Tobolsk. Orbicom has also brokered a deal under which Rover is supplying Pounds 1m-worth of cars and spares for Tobolsk's police force.</p>

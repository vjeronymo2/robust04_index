			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Chairman threatened by Tiphook price fall ANOTHER sharp fall in the share price of Tiphook yesterday made the position of Mr Robert Montague, founder and executive chairman of the container leasing and transport rental group, look increasingly precarious. The UK company's shares dropped by another 46p to 123p, a 27 per cent fall. They had already fallen nearly 30 per cent on Thursday after the loss-making group warned that it would breach its banking covenants. Tiphook is trying to negotiate new facilities with its bankers. The continuing pressure on its share price makes it more likely that the lenders will distance themselves from Mr Montague, who has been criticised for his buccaneering style and high salary. Mr Montague is, however, acknowledged to have a deep knowledge of the business and may continue in a diminished role. Shareholders could also insist on his departure or demotion, as they must approve new borrowing limits at an extraordinary general meeting. The group's gearing will soon breach 500 per cent, the ceiling allowed by its articles of association. The fall-out from Tiphook's financial difficulties will be felt particularly acutely in the US, where bid speculation and the size of the dividend yield had led to a strong following for the company's stock. More than half the shares are currently held in the form of American Depositary Receipts: these had shed Dollars 1/4 at Dollars 6 by midday yesterday. One US investment analyst said it was 'almost a given' that investors would launch legal action against Tiphook, claiming to have been misled by over-confident assertions about the company's prospects. Mr Andrew Silver, an analysts at investment bank Dillon Read, said Tiphook had on several occasions made statements about its outlook that had proved too optimistic.</p>

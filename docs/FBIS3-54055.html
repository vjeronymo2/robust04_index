			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Arab League Secretary General Dr. </F> 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, in Damascus, by Ashraf 'Abd-al-'Aziz in  Cairo; date not given; from the "Dialogue From Afar" program --  recorded]    [Text] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Welcome to our program.    ['Abd-al-Majid] Thank you.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Could you tell us about the talks you held  with various officials in Damascus?    ['Abd-al-Majid] Actually, I came to Damascus to attend the  annual session of the Arab agriculture ministers, which is  sponsored by the Arab Agricultural Development Organization.  During the meetings we looked into the agricultural strategy of  the Arab World in light of developments in the region. In my  opening speech, as well as in the talks I held, I emphasized the  importance of peace in the region as well as of confronting the  economic blocs that are being formed in other parts of the  world. It is essential that the Arab World takes a clear  position on these blocs, particularly following the signing of  GATT and other economic agreements.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Let us talk for a while about the Arab  economic strategy that the agriculture ministers are discussing.  What is the Arab vision of this strategy, particularly in view  of the current regional and international developments?    ['Abd-al-Majid] The Arab vision has several parts. The Arabs  need to maintain their food and water security. The Arabs  should also find a way to confront the economic blocs that have  sprung up in other parts of the world, particularly following  the signing of GATT, an agreement that will affect [trade in]  agricultural crops.    This topic....[pauses] The timing of the current meeting in  Damascus was good. GATT was signed in December. The official  signing ceremony will take place in April and then the agreement  will be ratified.    Among the topics discussed during the meeting was ending the  subsidies to agricultural products and farmers. This topic was  given much thought in many countries during the GATT talks and  the earlier talks in Uruguay. The Arab ministers are focusing  on these issues. We hope that, by the end of the meeting in  Damascus, a fuller picture will emerge of the Arab agricultural  strategy. Such a strategy is needed to protect the Arab food  and water supply, for it represents a part of Arab national  security    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Let us have a look at the other challenges  facing the Arab World, such as the issue of water.    ['Abd-al-Majid] The issue of water, as I said, is one of the  challenges preoccupying the Arab public in the entire region.  Of course, this and other topics will be discussed again at the  coming meeting of the Economic and Social Council, which will be  held in Cairo in February, God willing. The Arab League Council  will also review these topics during its regular session in  March.    The timing of the meeting here was good, as well as the  preparations. There is no doubt that the meeting and the  discussions will help create a joint Arab position. This is all  I have got to say on this subject.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] How do you see the future of Arab economic  cooperation, especially in light of what is being touted as the  possible establishment of a Middle East [trade] area?    ['Abd-al-Majid] I have commented before and in length on the  matter of the Middle East market. First of all, we have to  discuss it with each other and see where we stand before we  begin talking about a Middle East market involving non-Arabs.  But, for starters, we should not be afraid of the prospect of a  Middle East market. We should get our act together and see  where our interests lie. I think that nothing can be imposed on  Arab countries. These countries are sovereign and will not  accept anything that contradicts their regional and pan-Arab  interests.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] There is a question on the minds of all  Arabs, private citizens as well as officials. What is happening  on your initiative to achieve Arab reconciliation? How far has  this initiative gone?    ['Abd-al-Majid] Hopefully, it is still alive and well. The  responses I have received so far have been limited. Actually, I  have received only 13 responses from the heads of states. But I  believe that there is a possibility for further consultations  about it. In the end, we will have to agree that it is in our  interest to clear the Arab atmosphere and restore Arab  solidarity, for this will strengthen the entire Arab World.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] How do you see these efforts proceeding? Is  there hope for genuine reconciliation among the Arab brothers?    ['Abd-al-Majid] I see some factors leading us somewhat  toward  clearing the Arab atmosphere. What is needed is more efforts.  I am confident that the Arab World can exert these efforts.  Arab reconciliation should be based on frankness.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Thank you.    ['Abd-al-Majid] You are welcome.</p>

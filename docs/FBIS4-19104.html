			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Prime Minister Cavaco Silva will depart tomorrow  for China. According to an interview by the prime minister to  NCNA [New China News Agency], this country is one of the  priorities of Portuguese foreign policy. The prime minister's  second visit to that country has many aims, but economic and  trade cooperation is no doubt the great Portuguese interest.  Evidence of this is the large party taken by the prime  minister, particularly a group of 60 businessmen. Maria  Pimentel will comment on Cavaco Silva's interview:    [Pimentel] We have found out that relations with China is  one  of the greatest priorities of Portuguese foreign policy.  Evidence of this statement by Cavaco Silva to NCNA is the  delegation the Portuguese prime minister is taking with him on  his second official visit to that country.    There are over 60 businessmen alone, representing the most  varied sectors. The aim is to take advantage of the open policy  of the Chinese to foreign investment. [passage omitted]    Let us remind you that the balance of payments between China  and Portugal is clearly unfavorable to Lisbon. Portugal  imported over 29.5 billion escudos worth of Chinese products and  the total of Portuguese exports was a little over five billion  escudos.    Cavaco Silva's visit to China -- the most  economics-orientated ever -- also aims to mark the seventh  anniversary of the joint Luso- Chinese Declaration on Macao,  which defined the transition rules of that territory to Chinese  administration within five years. Among the issues relating to  Macao's future which Cavaco Silva may debate with the Chinese  authorities, is the nationality of the Portuguese from Macao,  which is being considered by sources linked to the process as  the point of greatest friction at present between Portugal and  China.    [Announcer] Cavaco Silva will depart tomorrow morning for  China. He will be in the east for two weeks: seven days in  China and then Macao.</p>

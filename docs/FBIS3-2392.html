			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Shenzhen, March 4 (XINHUA) -- Crossing points in  this special economic zone bordering Hong Kong have adopted new  management methods to make it more convenient for people and  goods to enter and leave.    To make the work more efficient, some of the examination and  management fees are now collected at one go by the city  immigration office without change of payment standards, instead  of payment item by item.    Beginning May 1 this year, freight vehicles going through  land ports will receive unified examination concerning customs  affairs, sanitation and animal and plant quarantine.    As a result, freight vehicles entering or leaving the border  only have to stop twice instead of four times as at present.    By the end of the year computers will be installed at the  crossing points to handle examination and payment.</p>

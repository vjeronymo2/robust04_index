			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: Fairfax expects to exceed profits forecast JOHN Fairfax Holdings, the Australian newspaper group, expects to exceed the profit forecast for 1991-92 that was published in its pre-flotation prospectus earlier this year. Mr Dan Colson, acting chief executive, said earnings should be comfortably ahead of the forecast in spite of the Australian economy's slow recovery from recession. Fairfax, which is 15 per cent owned by Mr Conrad Black's UK-based Daily Telegraph group, had forecast pre-tax profits of ADollars 123m (USDollars 91.7m) for the year to the end of June, followed by ADollars 165m in the current year. Mr Colson said the directors were very optimistic. He confirmed that Fairfax was considering building a printing plant in Sydney to enable the group to compete more effectively with newspapers published by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. The plant, which would cost about ADollars 200m, would have the capacity to print colour news pictures. Mr Colson said Fairfax would probably appoint a chief executive within the next few weeks. Fairfax has been without a chief executive since December, when it was acquired for ADollars 1.4bn by a consortium led by Mr Black. The group was put into receivership in 1990 after an abortive buy-out of family shareholders by Mr Warwick Fairfax. The group publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, The Australian Financial Review, and The Age in Melbourne. It is the principal competitor to News Corporation.</p>

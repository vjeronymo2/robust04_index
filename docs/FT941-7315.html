			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Either get smarter or else get poorer - European manufacturing risks being too inept to equal the US and too lazy to match developing economies Just how serious is Europe's industrial competitiveness problem? The question falls into two parts. On the one hand, industry in Europe is by no means exclusively controlled by Europeans. Much is in the hands of American, Japanese and other foreign corporations. On the other, the big European companies are by no means confined to Europe, but conduct their operations around the world. The first set of questions thus concerns employees located in Europe: how far can they compete with workers elsewhere, regardless of who employs them, and to what extent can they attract investment and technology to Europe? The second has to do with European managers. Regardless of where they operate around the globe, how well can they compete against their US or Japanese rivals? How successful, in a global context, is the European business culture? The distinction between these issues is clearly illustrated by a company like Unilever. With its Anglo-Dutch origins and head offices in London and Rotterdam, Unilever appears a classic and highly successful European company. But more than half its operating assets are now outside Europe. Its European workforce has shrunk by a third over the past decade, while its global employment has remained constant overall. In such cases, European corporations are part of the mechanism whereby jobs are exported from Europe. The interests of European workers and managers are, thus, in one sense opposed. Certainly, if the footloose European manager does a good job outside Europe, wealth will flow back to the European parent via dividends. But dividends form only a very small part of the wealth created through the value-added chain. And in today's global financial markets, many shareholders in Unilever, Shell or Siemens are not European. The performance of European workers is best examined on a macroeconomic level, particularly since the picture varies between EU countries. First, employment. An OECD study of 13 leading industrial countries calculates that, in the past 20 years, manufacturing employment overall has fallen by 8 per cent. But in Europe it has fallen 20 per cent (35 per cent in the worst casualty, the UK). In the US it has barely changed, while in Japan it has risen by 2 per cent. A similar picture emerges of the contribution of manufacturing to the economy. The figures are tricky to interpret, since manufacturing's share in any developed nation tends to fall as a result of rising productivity and lower prices. The issue is what is happening to industry's contribution to GDP in volume terms; that is, at constant prices. On that measure, the OECD reckons that in most European countries - including Germany, France and the UK - the share of manufacturing has fallen over the past 20 years. In the US it has stayed roughly the same. In Japan it has risen. In terms of research and development, the picture is rather less gloomy. Between 1985 and 1990, according to a separate OECD study, the EU's share of industrial R&amp;D rose from 27 per cent to 28 per cent of the OECD total, while the US share fell from 51 per cent to a still-dominant 45 per cent. As for inward investment, the picture is cheerful. In 1985, a third of the world's direct inward investment entered the EU. In the late 1980s, the figure rocketed, and by 1990 reached almost half. Some, such as Japan's investment in cars and photocopiers, owed much to the formation of the single market and the threat of Fortress Europe. Yet, it remains a corrective to the idea that the rest of the world no longer sees Europe as a place to make things. But what does Europe now make? Japan's contribution notwithstanding, the OECD's 13-country study suggests some dispiriting answers. Take, for instance, the share of world export markets in manufactured goods. Over the past 20 years, the US has seen its position eroded by Japan, while Europe's position has stayed roughly stable. Within that, though, there has been a tendency for Europe to export more low-technology goods, such as Italian textiles, and fewer high-technology goods, such as computers. In Japan, the trend is the reverse: high-tech sectors provide the fastest growth. The picture is borne out by data in a recent European Commission publication which ranks sectors in the EU that gained competitiveness in the period 1986-91 and those that lost it. The top sectors are wood processing, ethyl alcohol, cotton manufacture and leather tanning. Among the worst are computers, office equipment, medical equipment and motor components. Before Europeans become too depressed, however, it is worth examining the other side of the coin: the competitiveness of European management in the wider world. American executives tend to dismiss Europe as an international competitor. But as a senior executive at Siemens, the German electronics giant, remarks, Americans wrote off the European electronics industry a decade and more ago. Yet, in the past decade Siemens's sales in the US have almost trebled to Dollars 5bn, while its US employees have gone from 13,600 to 33,500. European Commission figures tend to support this observation. In a ranking of the world's top 200 industrial groups by turnover, the EU plus EFTA accounted for 73 companies in 1986, against the US's 79. By 1990 the European total had reached 79, against the US's 68. Europe also overtook the US in share of turnover, with 40 per cent versus 37 per cent. Some of this may be due to currency movements: but there is no doubt European giants like Shell, Roche or Unilever are the equal of their international competitors. Having a number of star players, though, is not the same as strength in depth. A telling sidelight comes from General Electric, one of the US's most successful companies and its biggest by market value. An important part of GE's strategy has been to avoid areas where Japan is strong and to focus on those where the competition is European, such as lighting, power generation and aero engines. This might symbolise the danger for Europe. It risks being seen as a soft target: no longer sophisticated enough to match the US or Japan, and too lazy and highly paid to match the developing countries. As a half-way house, this is unsustainable. In the long run, European industry must either get smarter, or it will get poorer.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Shares of OECD trade in manufactures  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Percentage                        1970                             1990             1970   High    Med    Low        1990   High    Med    Low  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- US          20.3   31.1   21.7   13.4        17.4   26.3   15.4   13.3 Japan       11.0   13.2    8.5   13.2        15.0   21.1   16.9    7.1 Germany     18.9   17.7   23.1   15.0        20.6   16.2   24.7   17.9 France       9.3    7.7    8.5   10.7        10.3    8.7   10.0   12.1 Italy        7.3    5.5    7.1    8.5         8.6    5.1    7.7   12.8 UK          10.4   10.5   11.9    8.9         8.9   10.2    8.5    8.5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Percentage of total manufactured exports of top 13 OECD countries  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

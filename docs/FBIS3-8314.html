			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1400 GMT on 7 March carries within  its regular 30-minute newscast several reports on the combat  situation in the republic:    According to Maglaj correspondent Hajrudin Cermic, "instead  of a cease-fire arranged to exchange the dead bodies of the  soldiers of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and those of the Serbian  aggressor, Maglaj is being subjected to artillery fire. After  unsuccessful attacks on [words indistinct], the attacks were  directed exclusively on civilian targets. Some 70 57-mm shells  were fired from Bofors, while tanks are opening intermittent  fire from [name indistinct]. One civilian was wounded."    Correspondent Mirudin Aldobasic reports from the 7th South  Operations Group that "the aggressor early this morning suddenly  shelled with heavy artillery Kalosevici and the lines of defense  of the 207th Brcko Brigade and [word indistinct]. The shelling  is continuing, although infantry attacks have been successfully  repelled." Aldobasic also says that "the aggressor is  constantly" attacking defense lines in the Teslic region with  heavy arms.    Reporting on the shelling of Bihac, correspondent Mirza  Sadikovic says that "one shell alone killed three and wounded  five persons while they were performing their duties and jobs.  Regarding the new material damage, no one is talking about it  any longer. The final number of the victims of today's shelling  is still unfortunately unknown, considering that the killing  from the hills around Bihac is still going on. In addition to  Bihac, Cazin and the surrounding area are also being targeted  with howitzers and mortars."    Zavidovici correspondent Viktor Boban reports that "the  chetniks this afternoon launched attacks on the defense lines in  several sectors." He also says that the "defenders are fiercely  responding, not allowing the aggressor to advance even a  millimeter."    Boban concludes his report by saying that three civilians  have been killed.</p>

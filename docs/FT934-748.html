			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Judge rules SFO can withold papers The Serious Fraud Office should not have to give defence lawyers all documents covered by widely drafted notices under Section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 requiring banks to supply investigators with the relevant papers, a judge ordered yesterday. Lawyers for Mr Muhammed Naviede, the former head of the Manchester-based Arrows trading group who has been accused of fraud, had argued that the SFO should hand over all documents conceivably covered by the Section 2 notices. This covered papers not seen by investigators because the banks had not passed them on. The situation arose because, under the working of the SFO's Section 2 powers, it is often left to banks to decide which documents are relevant to a fraud investigation before handing them over. The defence lawyers had argued that the SFO had 'constructive possession' of documents, if not physical possession, even if it had decided they were not relevant to its inquiry. However, Judge Hawkins QC yesterday ruled that the SFO was not under any obligation to provide papers in such circumstances.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Husni Mubarak renewed his calls to Yemeni  leaders to stop fighting and to allow dialogue to triumph. He  affirmed that war never resolves any issue in the world. In  exclusive statements to Samir Rajab, chief editor of MAYU  newspaper, the president said war ends unity and does not  protect it. The Yemeni people are the ones paying the price  with their own blood and their vital institutions that are being  destroyed by the battles and wars. War has never resolved any  issue in the world, even when one party triumphs over another.    The president added that he has repeatedly advised Yemeni  leaders not to resort to military force. The basis for  resolving any problem should always be dialogue.</p>

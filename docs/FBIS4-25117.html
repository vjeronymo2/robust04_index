			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 14 April (MTI) -- A senior official at the  Chinese Foreign Ministry, anonymously told MTI's Beijing  correspondent that he saw no reason for the expansion of NATO,  now the Warsaw Pact organization has broken up.    The official made the remark in answer to a question on the  Chinese Government position on the integration of Hungary and  other Central European countries into NATO, and a possible  eastward expansion of the North-Atlantic organization.    This was the first time that a senior Chinese source had  taken a stand on the issue.    At a press conference held in Beijing for Central and  Eastern  European correspondents, the same senior official said China  understood Hungary's desire to become a full member of the  European Union and this way strengthen its links with other  European states.    However, the Chinese Government hopes Hungary will not  forget  about its eastern links while integrating into Europe, he added.</p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Bolivian stock set for listing in London A Bolivian electricity distributor will become the first Latin American company for decades to trade its shares on the London stock exchange if plans to list the group go ahead in November. The Cochabamba Light and Power Company could even be the first listing since the Antofagasta Chile and Bolivian Railway was registered, towards the end of the last century, according to Mr Peter Earl, a consultant with Fieldstone Private Capital Group. Fieldstone, an investment bank, is planning Cochabamba's listings in La Paz and London, as well as an 'offer for sale', with the overall exercise part of the recent restructuring of the country's electricity industry. It values the company at about Dollars 33m (Pounds 21m), and is giving priority to Bolivian investors, saying the London listing will be secondary. It is hoping that international investors will buy at least some of the 70 per cent stake, being sold by the Bolivian nationalised energy company. 'Until now, there has been no possibility of buying Bolivian stocks so there is considerable pent-up demand with large sums already deposited for this purpose in New York and London,' said Mr Earl. 'There has been considerable interest expressed by overseas investors particularly those from overseas markets,' he added. Earlier this year investor confidence in Latin America was dented by turmoil on international markets and signs of political instability, especially in Mexico. Although issuance is expected to fall from last year's record of Dollars 6bn, Latin American companies raised more than Dollars 3bn in international equity offerings in the first seven months of the year, according to International Financing Review, a specialist publication. Mr Earl says that the recent restructuring of the Bolivian electricity industry has followed the UK model. Describing the company as a 'Latin American Manweb', he says its operating profits rose 62 per cent and revenues 21 per cent in 1993. The Caracas-based Andean Development Corporation, a regional development body, is underwriting the issue alongside Fieldstone. International Equities, Page 21</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On the morning of 26 April, Zhao Zhihao, deputy  secretary of the provincial party committee and governor, gave  an important speech at the provincial conference on opening to  the outside world. He mobilized the people at the higher and  lower levels across the province to further emancipate the mind,  comprehensively implement the strategy of developing the export-  oriented economy to bring along the entire economy, accelerate  the progress of the patternized economy, and create a new  situation in developing an open economy in Shandong.    Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party committee,  presided over the conference.    Governor Zhao Zhihao's speech was divided into four parts:    1. Correctly understand the new situation facing the  province's opening up and strengthen the sense of urgency of  developing an open economy.    Zhao Zhihao said: Since reform and opening up, particularly  after the issuance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speech  made during his tour to South China, the whole province has  witnessed a developed economy, stable political situation, unity  among the people, and social progress. The entire modernization  drive has entered a new development period, and fairly big  breakthroughs have been made in opening to the outside world.  The province's open economy has begun to embark on the path of  sustained and rapid development. At present, the new pattern of  opening up in all directions and to all layers has been  basically formed in the province; great breakthroughs have been  made in the development of the export-oriented economy;  noticeable achievements have been made in developing friendly  contacts with foreign countries; and opening up has played a  noticeable role in promoting national economic and social  development.    Zhao Zhihao pointed out: Although our province has made  great achievements in opening to the outside world, we should  also soberly recognize that compared with advanced provinces and  cities, we still have disparities. The higher and the lower  levels across the province should enhance the sense of  responsibility and urgency, expand their work strength, and  realistically turn the province's advantages of natural  resources into advantages of the economy and competition,  improve quality to promote quantity increase, and enable the  province's economy to grow from a big one to a even stronger one.    2. Comprehensively implement the strategy of developing the  export-oriented economy to bring along the entire economy and  form a new advantage for our province's economic development.    Zhao Zhihao said: It is necessary to optimize the economic  structure, cultivate new industrial advantages, accelerate the  building of market systems, cultivate new market advantages,  press ahead scientific progress, form new technology and  personnel advantages, give play to the impetus role of cities,  strengthen the advantages of central cities, and establish new  mechanisms by deepening reforms.    3. Concentrate efforts on priorities, expand measures, and  promote a sustained, rapid, and sound development in the open  economy.    Zhao Zhihao said: To comprehensively implement the strategy  of developing the export-oriented economy to bring along the  entire economy, we must grasp the key points, pinpoint the  priorities, strengthen measures, and strive to make new  breakthroughs as quickly as possible. It is necessary to  optimize the province's overall plan of opening to the outside  world, raise the overall quality of opening up, continue to  implement the strategic policy of opening all parts of the  province to the outside world, making breakthroughs in some key  areas, pressing the work ahead step by step, combining the  efforts of the eastern part of the province with that of the  western part, accelerating development, stabilize and improve  the eastern part, accelerate development in the central part,  and adopt special policies to support the western part. We  should regard using foreign capital as the most important step  in the development of the open economy, realistically regard the  utilization of foreign capital as the key point for stimulating  national economic growth, and grasp this work firmly. We  should not be afraid of running an enterprise in the red as long  as it is in line with the industrial policy of the state, is  efficient, and is export-oriented; not fear letting foreign  businessmen hold a big portion of shares in general trades,  occupy a part of the market, or earn money. We should be bolder  and give a free hand in inviting business and introducing  capital. It is necessary to implement the strategy of  developing various kinds of markets, develop markets at home and  abroad, give emphasis to turning enterprises into industrialized  and international enterprise groups, actively develop enterprise  groups and companies in foreign countries, and persist in  setting high standards and a high starting point in the course  of accelerating the development of all sorts of development  zones. At present, our province has established 62 state-grade  or provincial-grade development zones of various descriptions.  In principle, no new development zones will be established in  the near future. As for those development zones that have been  approved, we must give different guidance, persist in setting a  high starting point, and make them have distinctive features.  It is necessary to strengthen the service systems and  realistically solve the prominent problems existing in the  development of the current open economy.    4. Further strengthen leadership, form a joint force, and do  a good job in the battle of opening to the outside world.    Zhao Zhihao said: Comprehensively implementing the strategy  of developing the export-oriented economy to bring along the  entire economy and accelerating the pace of linking up with the  international economic track is a new task, as well as a new  test for our people at all levels. We must further strengthen  leadership, mobilize the enthusiasm of all trades and  professions, turn them into a powerful joint force, and  resolutely fight well this battle of crucial importance. To  achieve this, we must further emancipate the mind, intensify  study and research, strengthen external propaganda, do a good  job in building contingents, and strengthen this joint force.    Zhao Zhihao pointed out: Seizing the opportunity, deepening  reform, expanding opening up, promoting development, and  maintaining stability is the overall situation of this year's  work. We should properly handle the relations of reform,  development, and stability, always uphold the principle of  taking a two-handed approach in work and be tough with both, pay  simultaneous attention to grasping economic work as well as  propaganda and ideological work, fighting corruption, and  promoting honesty. The provincial party committee and the  government are firmly convinced that as long as the higher and  the lower levels across the province unswervingly implement all  central principles and policies on reform, opening up, and  modernization, promote the spirit of fearing no hardships, are  unwilling to lag behind, are making earnest efforts to do  practical things, and are vying to create first-grade  achievements, we will surely be able to comprehensively create a  new situation in developing our province's open economy and  triumphantly fulfill the grand objective of modernization.</p>

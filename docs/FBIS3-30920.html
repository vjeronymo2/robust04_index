			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Krzysztof Gottesman, under the "Observations" </F> rubric]    [Text] The governing coalition, despite the agreement  reached on Tuesday [9 February] night, is going through a  serious crisis. In the middle of the budget debate, we first  witnessed the recall of Deputy Finance Minister Stefan Kawalec,  and a few days later -- the recall of Marek Borowski, deputy  prime minister and finance minister. Among observers and  politicians were, and probably still are, people who do not rule  out the possibility of a split within the coalition. Some are  already counting the votes in new configurations. A return to a  state of balance may turn out to be short-lasting.    All this is happening seemingly before the eyes of the  people. Seemingly -- because on television screens we can most  often see first of all Polonezes, Mercedeses, and Lancias, in  which participants of the talks arrive at various entrances;  these are frequently back entrances. Sometimes we can see  politicians entering a building: Either they have a not too  intelligent joke to tell, or do not condescend to say anything  to journalists' questions at all. Those who are criticizing  their partners for not having an appropriate information policy  are also acting this way. The prime minister's press secretary  most often says that she has nothing to say.    It all changes a little when the politicians come to the  conclusion that the situation is under control to such a degree  that a few general sentences can be said about the reached  agreement. This is exactly what happened yesterday night. The  preparations for the meeting at Parkowa Street were made in  strict secrecy. Journalists and photo reporters were constantly  misled by all possible methods.    Especially at important moments, politicians have the right,  and maybe the duty as well, to hold talks quietly, without any  microphones and camera lenses. It is more than certain that  appropriate services would be able to organize such a meeting of  the coalition of the Democratic Left Alliance and Polish Peasant  Party. However, if the prime minister -- the chairman of the  greatest Deputies' Club, the Sejm speaker, and a few other  politicians do not want to take advantage of such a possibility,  then it is their duty to the public to issue information about  such negotiations. No matter what the result is. Otherwise, no  one should be surprised at the reluctant attitude of the mass  media toward the authorities.</p>

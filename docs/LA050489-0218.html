			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WAYS SOUGHT TO EXTEND V-22 TILT-ROTOR WORK  </P> <P> A top defense official said today the Pentagon is studying ways to grant at  least a temporary reprieve to the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor program, which might  avert threatened layoffs.  </P> <P> Deputy Defense Secretary Donald Atwood, making his first Capitol Hill  appearance since getting the No. 2 job at the Pentagon, told the Senate  Appropriations defense subcommittee that two options are being examined and a  decision should come "in a day or so."  </P> <P> Atwood was peppered with questions about the program widely supported in  Congress but canceled by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney as part of $10 billion  in budget cuts.  </P> <P> "We have been looking at several alternatives," Atwood told Sen. Arlen Specter  (R-Pa.), whose state is home to Boeing Vertol, a partner in the project with  Bell Helicopter Textron of Ft. Worth. Bell has said work on the V-22 will stop  Friday and has warned 8,000 employees that if nothing happens layoffs will  start Monday.  </P> <P> Specter told Atwood it would be expensive to halt the work now and then restart  it in fiscal 1990 if Congress revives the plane and asked Atwood to "explore  the possibility of maintaining enough effort to keep Bell in operation,  maintain the status quo while this is evaluated by Congress."  </P> <P> "Obviously we would encourage them (Bell) to continue and not break the  contract," said Atwood, noting that all Pentagon funds for the project in 1989  have been spent and if Bell stops work on the plane the contract will be  broken. Without additional tax dollars, Bell must spend its own money to keep  work going. If the Pentagon shifted more money to the work, key congressional  committees would have to give their permission.  </P> <P> Atwood said among the options being examined were continuing the project  "through some flight test program" or through "some kind of very minimal effort  of technology demonstration."  </P> <P> The plane has engine pods at the end of the wings with large propellers. The  pods can rotate from horizontal for plane-like flight to vertical for  helicopter-like takeoffs and landings. It is intended to haul Marines and  supplies up to 200 miles from offshore boats to landing points, and the Army  also is interested in the project. About $2.5 billion already has been invested  in the program.  </P> <P> Atwood said the program was canceled for purely budgetary reasons, not because  of any problem with the aircraft just now reaching the production stage or  because of any qualms about its capabilities.  </P></p>

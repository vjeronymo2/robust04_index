			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Three Filipino borrowers line up Eurobonds THREE Filipino borrowers are preparing to launch Eurobonds following the government's return to the market with a Dollars 150m issue in February. An expected Dollars 100m issue of three-year Eurobonds by Philippine Airlines (PAL) early next month will be followed by deals for the Philippine National Oil Company and the National Power Corporation. The PAL deal, arranged by Chemical Bank, is likely to be priced to yield 350 to 400 basis points over the comparable US Treasury yield. State-owned Philippine National Oil is planning to launch a Dollars 60m five-year deal via J P Morgan in September, and the National Power Corporation is set to launch a Dollars 150m five-year issue via Morgan Stanley the following month. Reports on Reuter that the International Monetary Fund had warned the Philippines against borrowing heavily in the Eurobond market were taken out of context, an IMF official in Washington said. He said the IMF has welcomed the Philippines' return to capital markets, provided they pursued a cautious approach. Activity in the Eurobond market yesterday was concentrated in dollars and yen. However, Euroyen offerings totalling Y60bn were pre-placed with investors in the eastern Asia, dealers said. Two floating-rate note issues, aimed at different groups of investors, were launched in the dollar sector. CSFB Finance launched a Dollars 50m issue of 10-year collared floating-rate notes, with a maximum coupon of 9 1/2 per cent and a minimum coupon of 5 1/2 per cent, which met strong demand from retail investors. Gota Bank, the Swedish bank which was rescued by the government in December 1992, launched a Dollars 100m issue of step-up floating rate notes via Chemical Bank. Like a number of other Swedish banks involved in last year's bail-out, it is now legally backed by the government. Another Swedish bank, the Urban Mortgage Bank, recently completed a similar deal in the private placement market.</p>

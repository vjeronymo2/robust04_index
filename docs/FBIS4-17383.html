			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 23 TASS -- Russian Federation Council  Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko has suggested extending military  service for warrant officers for another five to ten years with  their consent.    Shumeyko sent a draft law "on military duty and military  service" to the State Duma chairman on Saturday.    "There is a shortage of warrant officer specialists in the  Russian Armed Forces," Shumeyko explained. At present, warrant  officers retire at the age of 45. After retirement from the  army, many of them start looking for a job in the civilian  sector whose employees themselves are facing redundancy claims.    Extended military service up to 55 years for warrant  officers  could help partially ease the problem, provided they want to  stay in the army, Shumeyko said.</p>

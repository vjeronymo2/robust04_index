			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Prison staff 'acted unlawfully' Prison officers who refused to accept new prisoners into an overcrowded jail were acting unlawfully, a High Court judge ruled yesterday. Mr Justice Keene said the officers at Preston prison had an 'understandable anxiety' that a breach of the peace might occur, but he rejected their argument that they had an overriding 'constabulary power' to disobey their governor's orders to continue admitting new inmates. In the highly regulated and disciplined atmosphere of a prison it was essential that a governor's lawful orders, based on Home Office admissions criteria, prevailed over the individual discretion of his officers, the judge said.</p>

The covered deck and large expanses of glass on both end walls allow  you to enjoy the surroundings of your cabin location.  </P> <P> The plan was done in cooperation with the American Plywood Assn. and includes a  complete step-by-step guide in constructing the cabin from clearing the ground  to furnishing ideas.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart 3852_Deferment of Assessment Work. This subpart would be amended for purposes of updating and clarification. Amendments would occur in the following sections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3852.0&hyph;3&blank;Authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3852.2&blank;Filing of Petition for deferment, contents. The first two sentences of paragraph (a) would be revised to state clearly the filing requirements for a deferment of assessment work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3852.3&blank;Notice of action on petition to be recorded. This section would be amended to state more clearly the recording requirements for a petitioner, once the BLM authorized officer has ruled on the merits of the petition for deferment of assessment work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Removal of Obsolete Provisions and General Streamlining of Mining Law Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Parts 3720, 3800, 3810 and 3820 of title 43, Code of Federal Regulations have subparts and sections that are no longer in effect or no longer operative due to the repeal of the statutes upon which they are based or the transfer of the regulatory authority to another Interior agency that has promulgated new rules to replace the current rules. The proposed rule would reflect these changes. Subpart 3827 is consolidated into subpart 3809, as the two sets of surface management regulations are duplicative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part 3720_Public Law 357; Entry and Location of Source Materials upon Public Lands Valuable for Coal; Subpart 3722_Report to Geological Survey. Existing part 3720 and subpart 3722 of this title are based upon Section 1 of the Act of August 11, 1955 (30 U.S.C. 541), concerning payment by mining claimants to the United States for the value of lignite coal mined and removed in the development of mines for source materials (uranium, thorium, and other radioactive minerals). As further provided by section 10 of the Act of August 11, 1955 (30 U.S.C. 541i), this provision expired on August 11, 1975, and all mining claims located upon coal-bearing lands under this Act terminated by operation of law unless patent had been applied for prior to August 11, 1975. All coal lands were removed from mineral location and entry as of August 11, 1975. Therefore, part 3720, including subpart 3722, would be removed in its entirety and the part number reserved for future use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subpart 3809_Surface Management. This subpart would be amended to add the statute designating the King Range Conservation Area to the authorities section, to define the term in the definitions section, and to include the King Range in &sect;3809.1&hyph;4(b) as an area requiring a mandatory plan of operations for all activities exceeding casual use. The authorities section will also be amended to include the Act of April 16, 1993, for Stockraising Homestead Act lands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subpart 3811_Lands Subject to Location and Purchase. Three sections in this subpart are no longer necessary and would be revised or removed. Section 3811.2&hyph;2 relates to lands in National Parks and National Monuments. The Mining in the Parks Act (16 U.S.C. 1901  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), effectively closed all National Parks and Monuments to any further mining claim location or mineral entry. After September 28, 1976, no mining claims could be located in any unit of the National Park System. The existing language of &sect;3811.2&hyph;2, which provides that certain National Parks and Monuments are open to mining claim location, no longer serves any purpose. Regulations governing access to existing mining claims on National Parks and Monuments, and operations thereon, were published by the National Park Service in 1977, and are now codified at 36 CFR part 9. Section 3811.2&hyph;2 would be revised to state simply that no units of the National Park System are open to the location of mining claims under the General Mining Law of 1872, as amended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3811.2&hyph;3&blank;Lands in Indian reservations. This section would be revised to state that all Indian reservations are closed to the location of mining claims and to entry under the General Mining Law of 1872, as amended. The Papago Indian Reservation in Arizona (now called the To Ho No O'odham Reservation) was open to mining claim location and entry from June 18, 1934, until May 27, 1955, pursuant to the Act of June 18, 1934 (25 U.S.C. 461&hyph;479, as amended). Since May 27, 1955, this reservation has been closed to mining claim location, pursuant to the Act of May 27, 1955 (25 U.S.C. 463). All minerals on lands in Indian reservations may be acquired only by lease pursuant to the Act of May 11, 1938 (25 U.S.C. 396a), the Act of March 3, 1909 (25 U.S.C. 396), or the Indian Mineral Development Act of 1982, 25 U.S.C. 2101  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The regulations governing such mineral leasing is found in subchapter I, title 25, Code of Federal Regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3811.2&hyph;8&blank;Lands under Alaska Public Sale Act. The Alaska Public Sale Act (48 U.S.C. 364a-364e) was repealed effective October 21, 1986, by Section 703(a) of FLPMA (43 U.S.C. 1701). Accordingly, &sect;3811.2&hyph;8 would be removed in this proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3821.0&hyph;3&blank;Authority. This section is amended to add the Act of August 10, 1993, as one of the authorities for the regulations in part 3820.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3821.2&blank;Requirements for filing notices of locations of claims; descriptions. This section is amended to add maintenance, location, and service fees as fees payable under part 3820 when locating a claim. A further change states that the location notice or amendment is required to indicate the applicable acts under which the claim is filed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

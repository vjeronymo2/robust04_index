			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Graduate vacancies show 4% rise Graduate employment prospects have improved over the past year, a study by the Institute of Employment Studies shows. Its annual graduate review found a 4 per cent rise in the number of vacancies for graduates, the first increase since 1990. The unemployment rate among graduates was 12 per cent, down from 13 per cent in 1993. The institute said the unemployment rate was still much higher than in the boom years of the 1980s, although lower on average than the rate among non-graduates. A total of 30 per cent of employers reported difficulties in recruiting skilled workers compared with 17 per cent last year. Companies said the main problems were finding suitable employees with engineering, finance or accountancy skills. The report warns that the pool of available graduates is likely to increase by 27 per cent between last year and 1997 but it also says there will be a rise in the number of students delaying their entry into the labour market by going on to postgraduate studies. Dr Gill Court, one of the report's authors said: 'Competition for graduate jobs is likely to remain intense.' The institute also notes a rise in the number of students going into higher education. The number of full-time students on first degree courses rose by 14 per cent from last year. More than 30 per cent of young people were in higher education in 1993-94, compared with 13 per cent 10 years ago.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Stanley Leisure's Pounds 12m beats City expectations Stanley Leisure Organisation, the Liverpool-based betting shops and casinos group, reported a 53 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to a record Pounds 12.4m for the year to May 1. The result, which compared with Pounds 8.1m, was nearly Pounds 1m ahead of analysts' expectations. The shares closed up 14p at 333p. Turnover rose by 21 per cent to Pounds 265.2m (Pounds 218.5m). Earnings per share were 44 per cent ahead to 18p against 12.5p restated for January's Pounds 21m rights issue. A proposed final dividend of 3.5p lifts the total to 5.25p (4.21p). Dividend cover is 3.16 times on post-tax profits of Pounds 8.44m. Stanley now owns 419 betting shops and 19 casinos. Of the 66 shops bought in the year, 49 were the Selwyn Demmy chain in Scotland. Acquisitions, which also include two casinos, contributed Pounds 884,000 of the Pounds 15.38m operating profit and Pounds 14.47m of the Pounds 265.2m turnover. One casino and two small groups of betting shops have been bought since the rights issue - which was 98.83 per cent taken up - at a cost of only Pounds 3m. Cash balances improved to Pounds 2.79m (Pounds 3.63m overdraft). Gearing fell to 10 per cent (37 per cent) on increased shareholders' funds of Pounds 123m (Pounds 92.7m). Stanley, which renegotiated a five-year Pounds 45m revolving credit facility in March, remains cautiously acquisitive. Mr Leonard Steinberg, the chairman, said it would continue to use sensible prices and potential for improvement as the criteria for further buying. About Pounds 4m was spent on upgrading shops and casinos.</p>

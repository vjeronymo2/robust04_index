He is Anatoliy Lysenko, a 40-year-old  Ukrainian special services major. He was given away by a Polish  agent he himself recruited three years ago.    The agent will not escape the dock either. He is Janus B., a  22-year-old technical construction worker. Dozens of times he  illegally carried copper into Ukraine and spirits on the return  journey. Ukrainian border guards caught the smuggler, and  eventually he agreed to work for Ukrainian security service  organs. Janus delivered to Lysenko information about political  and other events in Poland's eastern provinces and church life.    Lysenko was arrested in August 1992 when crossing the  border.</p>

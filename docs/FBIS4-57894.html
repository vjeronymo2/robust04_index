			<p>BFN     [Text] Army Commander in Chief Lieutenant General Daniel  Garcia has praised the restructuralization of the Armed Forces  ordered by the executive branch. He said the changes will  improve the Armed Forces' performance, thus helping to  "guarantee the security of the democratic institutions."    Garcia gave a speech yesterday morning during a ceremony to  commemorate Army Day. The ceremony took place in the Army  square and was attended by President Luis Alberto Lacalle and  the cabinet.    The anniversary of the battle of Las Piedras was  commemorated  during a ceremony that took place during the afternoon in the  town of Las Piedras, and which was also attended by President  Lacalle. Mayor Jose Andujar gave a speech in which he defended  the amendment of the Constitution through a plebiscite that will  be held in November.    During the ceremony in the Army square, Garcia said the  Armed  Forces' restructuralization plan attained "a better use of  human, material, and financial resources, which is something  essential for the performance of a modern Army."    Among the measures that were adopted, he pointed out the  staff reduction in the Army General Command, Staff, and  Administrative Support Command, several of whose members were  reassigned "to field positions."    The objective, he said, is to "concentrate the basic units  in  the large elemental tactical units by carrying out the necessary  studies and coordination to modernize and readapt them."    After listing the many changes made in the force, he said  the  improvement of the efficiency, modernization, and readaptation  of the Army "will, in the future, allow the Army to efficiently  comply with its basic traditional mission of defending our  independence, peace, territorial integrity, Constitution, and  the laws within our specific jurisdiction, and will contribute  to guaranteeing the security of the democratic institutions,  which we hereby reaffirm."    In conclusion, Garcia said he is sure that "we are heading  toward a more efficient and professional Army in which unified  thought and action are and will be our line of action to attain  our basic objectives."</p>

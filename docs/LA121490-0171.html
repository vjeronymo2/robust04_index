			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DETMER INSISTS HE'LL RETURN FOR HIS SENIOR SEASON AT BYU  </P> <P> Heisman Trophy winner Ty Detmer insists he'll return to school as a senior and  wait until after graduation to enter the NFL draft.  </P> <P> The junior quarterback, who Thursday added the Maxwell Award to his trophy  case, repeated his intention to return to Brigham Young.  </P> <P> "First of all, I made a commitment to the school and I believe in living up to  that," Detmer said in a telephone interview with former college and NFL Coach  Dick Vermeil. "I'm just enjoying school right now. I don't think I'm ready to  go on my own yet. There is no reason for me to leave right now."  </P> <P> Detmer's statement was reminiscent of two other juniors, quarterback Andre Ware  of Houston and running back Barry Sanders of Oklahoma State, who uttered  similar sentiments after winning the previous two Heisman Trophys. They  insisted they were going back to school for their senior year, but both changed  their mind and are with the Detroit Lions.  </P> <P> Detmer didn't say his intentions were etched in stone.  </P> <P> Vermeil, former head coach at UCLA and with the Philadelphia Eagles, covered  Detmer in two games this season as an analyst for ABC.  </P> <P> "I've never seen a kid throw the ball more accurately. Now he's not the biggest  guy. He's not the most elusive guy. He's just one of those guys who is gifted  when it comes to throwing the football where it has to be to be completed,"  Vermeil said.  </P> <P> "I wonder how great he would be if he only had to throw the ball 35 times a  game (instead of 50 or more)) and the offense ran 35 times a game. I think then  it would magnify how efficient he is as a passer. He throws the ball a lot. I  think he probably will be a very fine NFL quarterback."  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> OAS VOICES CONCERN ABOUT U.S. MOVE  </P> <P> The Organization of American States expressed deep concern Monday over the  entrance of U.S. troops into the Nicaraguan embassy residence in Panama last  month.  </P> <P> The resolution, approved 19-0 with the United States and six other countries  abstaining, was a watered-down version of a Nicaraguan proposal to declare the  Dec. 29 incident a flagrant violation of international law.  </P> <P> Canada, in its first vote since formally becoming an OAS member earlier in the  day, joined the Latin American and Caribbean nations who expressed concern over  the U.S. action, which occurred during the invasion to oust Panamanian military  ruler Manuel A. Noriega.  </P> <P> The resolution declared that the entrance by U.S. troops into the Nicaraguan  embassy residence was a violation of diplomatic privileges and immunities but  took note of a formal U.S. statement regretting the incident.  </P></p>

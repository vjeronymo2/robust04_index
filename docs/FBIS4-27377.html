			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Kang Yong-won] </F>   [Text] It was learned on 31 May that the 1.0195 trillion  won-scale Piho Project which is now being carried out by the ROK  Army and the ROK Air Force (30 mm anti-aircraft self-propelled  artillery project) encounters many problems. In other words,  the electronic optical tracing device which was developed in the  United States has many problems, including a defective sight  adjuster while firing.    It was also learned that our Navy's P-3C antisubmarine  control aircraft project, too, which is scaled at 620 billion  won, had to pay the U.S. manufacturing company $93 million to  recover its discontinued production line. The production line  was already discontinued when the project was initiated. At  that time our authorities failed to confirm if the company had  discontinued the production line because they lacked the  capability of collecting sufficient information on the U.S.  company.    These facts were revealed in an "Inspection White Paper"  released by the Ministry of National Defense [MND] on 31 May  after inspecting eight ongoing projects, including the  antisubmarine control aircraft project and the Sangmu project,  from January to March this year.    It is the first time that the MND released the results of  its special inspection of these projects under the Yulgok  Project in the form of a white paper. This white paper was  released in accordance with the promise that Defense Minister Yi  Pyong-tae made at the time of the MND's initiation of the  special inspection.    In the case of the antisubmarine control aircraft project,  the white paper indicated that our side had to pay the U.S.  Lockheed Company, the P-3C antisubmarine control aircraft's  manufacturing company, extra money to recovering its already  suspended production line, thereby resulting in wasting our  budget.    The white paper revealed that the U.S. Lockheed Company had  announced the suspension of the production of antisubmarine  control aircraft in 1990. Our side had to submit itself to the  burden of paying money to recover the suspended production line.  This was because our authorities concerned lacked the  capability of collecting information.</p>

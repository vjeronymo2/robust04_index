			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Burdened but unbowed: The fight over Russia's economic policy Mr Yegor Gaidar, who was forced to step down as Russia's finance minister yesterday, told the Financial Times as the announcement was made that he was determined to ride out the criticism of his economic reform policy. Though he said Mr Yeltsin 'fully supports this government and the direction of its policy', he also said his tight credit policy would be significantly relaxed under pressure from the industrial managers, now starved of credits and with debts to the banks and to each other of more than Rbs600bn. He said that about Rbs100bn would be quickly made available to these enterprise bosses, 'enough to ease their problems, but not so much that that it threatens hyperinflation'. Mr Gaidar said he could no longer adhere to his previous target of balancing the budget this year, and that there would be a large overshoot in spending in March, April and May. This was because the government would fulfil its promises to fund some programmes that it had squeezed in the first two months of this year. However, he said in the second half of the year he would be able to tighten money supply again: 'I make no commitment on this, but I would hope we would keep to a deficit of less than 5 per cent of Russia's gross domestic product at the end of the year' (this compares with a 20 per cent deficit on the all-Soviet budget at the end of 1991). He said the International Monetary Fund had itself suggested the loosening of credit - suggesting that without its pressure he might have continued the tight policy. Stressing that he would stay on as deputy prime minister, Mr Gaidar forecast he would come under attack at Monday's meeting of the Russian Congress of Peoples Deputies: 'There will be very strong criticism from the old communist bloc, there will be very strong criticism from the Russian nationalists, who will say I am selling the country to the IMF and the western powers. We will be criticised by the agrarian deputies because we don't care about agriculture and we will be criticised by the enterprise managers because they face serious problems of industrial restructuring. 'But what really should be at issue will be this: can you really afford to change the government now? Because a change of government will mean an institutional mess, and it will be very bad to get rid of a government that is so recently in office.' He added: 'I think we will survive next week.' Mr Gaidar said that the Dollars 18bn balance of payment support and Dollars 6bn stabilisation fund from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries announced on Wednesday was 'a sign of very serious support. And it was the right moment to do it from the political point of view.' He said he was 'very satisfied' with the IMF's offer of a 3 per cent quota, giving borrowing rights of Dollars 4bn once Russia gained membership at the end of this month. 'Of course, we would like more as a big important country, but first we have to prove we are a superpower economically as well as a superpower because we have nuclear weapons.' Mr Gaidar says the government will use the Dollars 6bn stabilisation fund to allow the Russian Central Bank to intervene in the markets to keep the rouble at a rate floating at - on his present estimates - 40 to 50 roubles to the dollar (it is presently at Rbs110). He said the government's original calculations that the rouble could be fixed at 25 to 30 roubles to the dollar had been revised, and that 'we would never attempt to defend an overvalued rouble'. There were no fears, he said, that there would be a speculative run on the rouble which would eat up all of the Dollars 6bn stabilisation fund  - 'quite small interventions by the bank would be enough to deter speculators, because the market is really quite limited'. He said the new rate of the rouble should be set after oil prices were raised (though not freed) to about Rbs2000 a tonne in two months. Liberalisation of oil prices to world levels might take a year and half longer after the first price rise to allow the restructuring of the industry. It would reach these levels in stages. He would not be drawn on what other changes would be announced in a wider reconstruction of the cabinet, but said that Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, would remain as prime minister. He evaded giving any reply on the future of Mr Gennady Burbulis, the first deputy prime minister: it seems likely that Mr Burbulis will lose this role in the reshuffle. There was no sign in the interview, given in the old Communist Party Central Committee headquarters, that Mr Gaidar was a broken politician: merely one who has learned to compromise, and to survive.</p>

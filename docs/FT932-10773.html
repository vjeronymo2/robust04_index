			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Hospitals raise only a third of target income A GOVERNMENT programme to encourage hospitals to make money from activities such as retail services has fallen far short of its financial targets, a National Audit Office report shows today. The income generation scheme was introduced in 1988 and the government hoped it would raise Pounds 75m a year. According to the report, however, health authorities and hospitals generated only Pounds 25m in 1991-92. Even so, the National Audit Office believes income generation has 'significant potential' in the National Health Service and says that, in principle, the Pounds 75m target should be attained. It believes one reason for the failure to met targets so far has been due to managers giving priority to introducing the 1991 health service reforms. 'However, these reforms will in themselves offer additional incentives for units in future to exploit income generation where it would represent a sensible use of their resources,' the report says. An examination of three hospitals by the NAO and Touche Ross management consultants concluded that they could raise additional net income of Pounds 298,000 in ways that would safeguard patients' interests. The Department of Health has appointed its North Western regional health authority to act as the lead region in promoting similar projects. Authorities and hospitals have introduced a range of activities, from leasing retail space and car park charges to offering occupational health services to industry. The report recognises that some hospital managers will not wish to share expertise with potential competitors. But it says the NHS management executive should promote networks of hospitals willing to share knowledge. Income Generation in the NHS. National Audit Office. HMSO. Pounds 7.40.</p>

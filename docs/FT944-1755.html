			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Dockers meet brokers over shares bonanza In the cabins and mess room of one of Britain's biggest ports this morning two stockbrokers will address dockers, dredging crews and engineers on the technicalities of a deal which could bring port employees windfalls of up to Pounds 60,000 each. The workers who will meet the Wise Speke stockbrokers in the next two days are all shareholders in the Tees and Hartlepool Port Authority. Powell Duffryn, part of the consortium which owns the authority's parent company, Teesside Holdings, wants to take full control of the business and has offered shareholder employees, who hold a 5 per cent stake, Pounds 18.17 a share. Many of the 338 employee shareholders - from a workforce of 920 - obtained their shares for Pounds 1.07 each nearly three years ago when Teesside Holdings took over the authority. A number also received one free share for each one they bought. Powell Duffryn, which has launched a fully underwritten Pounds 70.7m rights issue to fund the acquisition of the shares it does not own, seems virtually certain to gain the 75 per cent acceptance it needs at extraordinary general meetings in London and Middlesbrough after Christmas. But it is anxious that authority worker-shareholders understand that if they are to receive the Pounds 18.17 offered for each of their shares, holders of 75 per cent of the employees' shares must separately give their consent for the articles of association of their Employee Benefit Trust to be changed. Without this consent, which they must give individually by letter by January 9, their shares will continue to be locked into the Employee Benefit Trust. This would cut them out of the Pounds 18.17 a share offer and allow them to sell only at the dealing price, currently Pounds 2.98 a share. In spite of this complexity Mr Jeff Gregory, Teesdock shift foreman, says the stockbrokers will find a well-informed workforce. He said: 'It's remarkable how the average working man can get pretty clued up if it means money to him. You'd be very surprised how much the average working person values money when they have the chance to get some.' Mr Gregory, who holds 700 shares, says the employee shareholders are 'gearing up each other' to make sure apathy does not prevent the 75 per cent vote for the trust's rule change. Most people are 'pretty chuffed' at the prospect of making about Pounds 18,000 on average. The only cloud, he said, had been the disgruntlement of those who did not buy shares or, worse still, sold them within the last year for less than Pounds 3 each. Mr William Baker Baker, one of the Wise Speke stockbrokers giving the dockside advice sessions, expects a high level of awareness. He expects most discussion to centre on capital gains tax, since the alternative offer of Powell Duffryn shares, rather than cash, offers the opportunity to avoid CGT liability. Mr Baker Baker said: 'One does go from the sublime to the ridiculous. From the boardroom with its coats of arms to the dockers' cabin where the most comfortable chair is in plastic.' But, he added, 'you get a full and frank exchange at the A dock. And the quality of the coffee's better there'.</p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Higher and mightier yet at Davos World Forum / A report from a more than usually august annual economic gathering in Switzerland FEW, if any, organisations can rival Switzerland's World Economic Forum at bringing together a broad cross section of the world's business and government leaders. But the guest list at the annual conference, which ended yesterday at the Swiss ski resort of Davos, defied belief. The leaders of virtually all the eastern European countries - including the warring Yugoslav states - were there. The heads of almost all the former Soviet Union's republics came, and the one who did not - Mr Boris Yeltsin - sent a message. South African leaders, black and white, spoke from the same platform. The attraction of the Davos gathering is that it gives a variety of leaders an opportunity to meet each other, and top businessmen, in a private and totally secure environment without having to respect the niceties of protocol. Many such meetings in the past few days may turn out to have been important, notably those between the Indian and Pakistani prime ministers and between the Greek and Turkish leaders. In general, however, the conference was simply overwhelmed by the eastern European and Commonwealth of Independent States presence. In every corner, there was a president from one of these countries trying to convince an audience of his country's commitment to free market principles, of its overall stability and, hence, of its worthiness for aid and foreign investment. This was easier for some than for others. The Russians had the most difficulty, with a gaggle of bright young officials eager to express contentious views in remarkably fluent English. According to one of them, the CIS could break up within a few months leading to brutal border disputes between the increasingly nationalistic republics. Another maintained that there was no doubt that inflation and unemployment would soon be brought under control and the rouble would proceed steadily toward convertibility. (The rule at Davos is that remarks cannot be attributed publicly to an individual unless he makes them in a plenary session.) The eastern Europeans were more calm and convincing, and many acknowledged that their main development problem was not so much a lack of capital as the scarcity of skilled people who could design and execute sound projects. Hence the aggressive appeal to western industrialists to bring their own projects. Some countries even brought glossy brochures promoting themselves. 'A new state on the sunny side of the Alps,' proclaimed one from Slovenia. A disturbing cultural question crept into the debates on European integration, with some participants wondering if the EC was deliberately dragging its feet on opening to eastern countries that did not share the Judeo-Christian culture. Croatia and Slovenia stressed their 'western-ness' in their appeals for admission to western European institutions, and trying to distance themselves from their neighbours. This was not lost on the others. 'Don't forget the new countries south of the Sava, proclaimed the leader of one of the southern Yugoslav republics at one session. What the 1,000-odd businessmen, who had paid Dollars 10,000 apiece for the privilege of facing all these begging bowls, made of it is hard to tell. Many preferred to bury themselves in their own mini-summits for much of the conference, leaving the preening politicians and their top advisers to their academic and media hangers-on. The Forum is supposed to be an occasion for discussion of global economic issues, but this year at least, these took a back seat to politics, perhaps because no one was able to think of anything positive to say. 'The tone is very gloomy,' admitted Mr Jean-Claude Paye, secretary-general of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Forum also aims to push forward discussion on other leading issues of the day, as suggested in the rather pretentious overall theme for this year's conference: global co-operation and megacompetition. Perhaps because global politics are evolving so quickly, discussion rarely seemed to get beyond descriptions of the complexity of the issues involved in building the much talked about new world order. But, as Mr Henry Kissinger, one of the conference's ageing chairmen, reminded everyone, compared to the grim confrontations of the cold war era, these were not bad problems to have.</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Relaunch into more enterprising culture - Paul Abrahams sets the scene for today's ICI result IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, flagship of British manufacturing industry, will today announce its first results without Zeneca, its recently floated bioscience operations. Mr Ronnie Hampel, ICI's new chief executive, will have the opportunity to describe how he intends to navigate the world's sixth largest chemical group through the malaise that has overwhelmed the sector. The demerger's aim is to allow ICI executives to concentrate on a narrower range of businesses, and to release what Mr Hampel calls 'creative management energies.' ICI is being relaunched with a very different and much more enterprising and profit-conscious culture, he argues. ICI could have done with some creative management in the past. As Mr Hampel admits: 'Our focus on profitability was less good than it should have been. ICI did not drive its businesses, good or bad, hard enough.' Management will need to be especially creative; the trading environment is grim and Mr Hampel's targets are challenging. Each business will be required to achieve a rate of return on assets employed of at least 20 per cent on average over the next five years. His ability to achieve such targets will depend partly on management and partly on the economic cycle. The company is two thirds of the way through a three-year restructuring programme aimed at saving Pounds 400m a year. About 17,000 jobs have disappeared. A further 7,000 will go over the next three years, and another 8,000 through disposals of non-core and under-performing businesses, according to Mr Hampel. However, such measures may only allow ICI to stand still, given the poor business environment. Most of the group's activities are heavily cyclical, capital-intensive operations whose profitability is volume-related. Prices for ICI's products will have to improve before it can start increasing profits significantly. Mr David Ingles, chemical analyst at brokers James Capel, explains: 'Prices depend upon the demand and supply balance and this is almost impossible to predict in terms of either its extent or timing.' On the plus side, about a quarter of ICI's turnover is in the US, where a patchy recovery is happening. A further 20 per cent is generated in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region, although some of that is in Australasia. The UK market, which accounts for about 25 per cent of sales, is also recovering, but slowly. On the minus side, continental Europe, which generates 25 per cent of turnover, is decelerating rapidly, to the extent that it could undermine the UK recovery. Some divisions are less affected by the economic malaise. Both paints and explosives are stable businesses. Paints generated sales of Pounds 1.5bn last year and operating profits of Pounds 115m. Kleinwort Benson is predicting profits of Pounds 107m for the full year. Operating profits from explosives last year were Pounds 59m on turnover of Pounds 549m and Pounds 50m is forecast on sales of Pounds 600m this year. Results at the materials division are likely to be be dire. With sales of Pounds 1.8bn last year - 22 per cent of group turnover - the division incurred a Pounds 25m loss and is expected to make only Pounds 10m for the full-year. More difficult to predict is the performance of ICI's industrial chemical division, which still dominates the company. It made sales last year of Pounds 3.5bn, 42 per cent of group turnover, and lost Pounds 17m in the process. The medium-term outlook for industrial chemicals remains grim. Prices of PVC  -of which ICI's partly owned subsidiary EVC is Europe's largest manufacturer - have fallen from a peak of DM1.85 in 1989 to DM1 during the second quarter of this year. In the longer term, investors are betting that the division's profitability will recover to the peak levels of 1989, when as industrial products it reported trading profits of Pounds 789m on sales of Pounds 5.7bn. But even if demand picks up, it is doubtful that profits will reach such levels. Mr Ingles reckons that there will be no repeat of the rapid recovery seen in the 1980s and the massive imbalance between supply and demand is likely to dominate the sector for many years. One leading manufacturer of titanium dioxide - ICI is the world's second largest producer - thinks that it could be 1997 before demand catches up with supply. Mr Hampel recognises that most ICI businesses are cyclical and there is little he can do to change cyclical fluctuations in demand. He says the company has a simple overall objective - to enhance shareholder value by developing businesses selectively and profitably. 'Gone are the days when ICI could afford to carry businesses in which we can have no competitive advantage and which do not have profitable potential,' says Mr Hampel. The less profitable are likely to be selected out of the company. Some businesses will be disposed of or swapped, though not necessarily in the near future. The company has low debts and is not a distressed seller. The ICI that leaves the 1990s will be very different from the one that entered the decade. Mr Hampel now has to prove that it can be more profitable.</p>

			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Retailers' respite expected to be brief BRITISH RETAILERS had a brief respite from dismal high-street trading last month, but the rise in sales was not spread across all sectors and may not last long. The CBI's latest monthly survey of distributive trades, which questioned 502 companies, also showed that most sectors are cutting back stocks because of fears that trading will deteriorate. September's 'modest' improvement in the high street was driven by sales of clothing, footwear, furniture and confectionery. However grocers, whose sales have tended to rise during the recession, saw trading stall at last year's level for the third month running. Off-licences, chemists, speciality food and durable household goods suffered badly. All of the retail trades apart from clothing and confectionery considered sales poor for the time of year. Retailers are cutting back on orders placed with suppliers, although at a slower rate than in recent months, but they still consider stock levels too high compared with expected sales. Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, said: 'Retailers fear that October will see September's gains reversed.' All wholesaling sectors reported higher sales except builders' merchants, agricultural machinery and electrical installation. Mr Whittaker added that wholesaling stocks were also 'still too high', despite cuts over the summer. Wholesalers expect October sales to remain ahead of last year, and will use that as a chance to reduce stock further. Motor traders reported that sales of parts and accessories continued to rise.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     CBI DISTRIBUTIVE TRADES SURVEY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Sep   Nov   Jan   Mar   May   Jul   Sept                              91    91    92    92    92    92     92 Retail total                 +8   +25   +21    -5   +14   -15     +4 Grocers                     +50   +67   +46   +38   +48    +3     +1 Specialist food              -3   +23   -38   +16   -15   -54    -50 Off-licences                 -7   -26   -59   -12    -8    -3   -100 Clothing                    -31   +47   +56   -24   +21   -25    +42 Footwear                    -48   -15   +77   -93   +33   -30    +39 Hsehold durables            -42    -5   +10   -26   -33   -10    -11 Furniture                   +53   +15    -7    +4   -33   -43    +48 Hardware/DIY                +18   -20    -7   -22   +36   -28    -52 Confectionery               +25   +36   -15    +9    +4   +26    +37 Booksellers                 -28   -32    +6   -27   -28    -9     -1 Chemists                    +83   +37    +4   +18   +66   +36    -28 Other retail                 -7   -24   +38   -45   +12   +13     +5 Motor trades                -66   -50   -42   -43    -8   -44    -33  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Balance = % reporting an increase minus % reporting a decrease in sales compared with a year before  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

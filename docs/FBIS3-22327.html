Such checks will be held in the very  near future in a further nine regions. Basically where nuclear  electric power stations are in operation.    The conclusions of experts who spent two weeks making a  detailed study of the situation are not reassuring. Over 500  violations were revealed in the oblast. The establishments  which present a serious danger include the Saratov hydroelectric  power station [GES] across which highways and railroads run.  Recently numerous freight trains have been accumulating and  standing idle for a long time in front of the giant dam.    The manmade seas -- the Saratov and Volgograd reservoirs --  also contain an inexorable threat. Their banks are being eroded  so rapidly that in a year or two water could descend on the  highways, telegraph lines, and oil bases created here. The oil  pipeline laid in the thirties has also become a time bomb in the  Volga region capital.    The Moscow experts also took a look at the underground gas  storage station, the largest in Europe, at the Balakovo nculear  electric power station, the "Nitron" and "Khimvolokno"  production associations, and many other potentially dangerous  establishments of which there are over 150 in Saratov Oblast.    In connection with the change in the form of ownership, at  many of these enterprises there has been a collapse of the  engineering services which used to keep track of manufacturing  discipline and were in charge of civil defense questions.    The tendency toward an increase in accidents has been  growing  in recent years. Last year over 1,200 emergency situations were  recorded in Russia. And we ourselves prepared most of the  tragedies. According to Anatoliy Tkachev, chief of the  inspectorate of the Russian Federation Ministry for Civil  Defense, Emergency Situations, and the Elimination of the  Consequences of Natural Disasters, the main reasons for all  accidents are disregard for the requirements of industrial and  ecological safety, extreme wear and tear on equipment, and  insufficient strictness on the party of leaders and supervisory  services.    The life and peace of any large city is a hair's breadth  away  from disaster day and night. That is why a law on the  protection of the population is essential in Russia today. And  the absence of such a law can also without exaggeration be  called the main emergency on a Russian scale.</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / New CSO head likely to set sights on selling data A MARKETING drive aimed at making economic data more useful to the commercial world may emerge after Mr Bill McLennan takes over as director of the Central Statistical Office in March. In recent years the CSO has been criticised for providing inaccurate data which have had to be extensively revised, particularly in areas such as trade figures and overall economic growth. Mr McLennan said the press had given the office a 'rough deal' which had not been fully deserved. 'Part of my job is to try to find out how that bad impression has come about, and to try to do something about it.' Mr McLennan, whose appointment was confirmed yesterday, is deputy head of the Australian Bureau of Statistics, where he has forged links with customers in industry. He hinted that he might introduce similar links at the CSO, which answers to Treasury ministers and is the UK's main agency for economic statistics. While the Australian agency raises 10 per cent to 15 per cent of its ADollars 150m (Pounds 62m) annual budget through sales to industry, the CSO gains less than 2 per cent of its Pounds 32m budget in that way, with the rest coming from the taxpayer. Mr McLennan said: 'Once you start charging (for data), users expect you to perform, and that in turn gives very strong feedback about what the users need. I am very comfortable with marketing and putting a price on things.' The agency says it has made important strides in increasing the quality of its information in the past year, thanks to improved surveys and staff increases. At present, the main thrust of the CSO's work is to provide data about the economy for the use of the Treasury, and relatively little effort has been made to put statistics into an ideal form for industry. As part of his new post, Mr McLennan, aged 49, also becomes head of the UK Government Statistical Service - which includes professional responsibility for all statistical services in other government departments outside the CSO. He will be paid Pounds 79,000 a year and will be given an allowance to help to find a home in London and to travel regularly to Australia, where he has two children at university. Mr McLennan is succeeding Sir Jack Hibbert as CSO chief. The office has about 1,100 staff, located in London, Watford, and Newport, Gwent. The workforce is to increase to about 1,280 in the next 14 months. Mr McLennan has been deputy head at the ABS since 1986 and has a high reputation in the international statistics community. Ms Barbara Bailar, director of the Washington-based American Statistical Association, was asked whether Mr McLennan would be able to transfer his skills to Britain. 'Going to the CSO from the outside will be a big challenge,' she replied. 'But if anyone can do it, it's Bill.' Professor Denise Lievesley, head of the Economic and Social Research Council's data archive unit at Essex University, said Mr McLennan was a wonderful manager who was good at recruiting and retaining high-quality staff. A person involved in the selection process said: 'He came across as a good, broad-brush administrator who knows what he wants and is good at putting ideas into practice.' Observer, Page 18</p>

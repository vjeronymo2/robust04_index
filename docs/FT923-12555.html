			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / International Company News: Battle for Germany's domestic skies - Lufthansa's challenge to BA BRITISH Airways' efforts to stay in the lucrative German domestic airline market are being challenged by Lufthansa, which is set to launch a budget rival airline. At the centre of the battle is the custom of high-spending business passengers in Europe's biggest country. BA ran air services between Berlin and west Germany throughout the cold war following the allies' occupation. German reunification in 1989 ended this special status. As a foreign-owned airline, it is being forced to close its international service by 1994. However, last month's agreement in Brussels to deregulate European air travel may eventually allow foreign carriers to operate within Germany. BA has determined to keep a strong presence in Germany. It found financial backing from a consortium of German banks for its plan to form a German airline, Deutsche BA. The banks hold 51 per cent of Deutsche BA so that it qualifies as a German airline. The consortium bought Delta Air, a regional airline in Friedrichshafen which was fully absorbed into Deutsche BA. Through the takeover, BA and its new partners gained control of one of the lowest-cost German carriers. It breaks even with only half its seats filled. Last month it inaugurated its Berlin-Munich and Berlin-Stuttgart routes using three new leased Boeing 737/300s. Delta's old fleet of Saab 340s serves 19 other European destinations. Berlin-Dusseldorf and Berlin-Cologne/Bonn will be added this autumn when BA winds down its old German service, well ahead of schedule. Mr Gerd Leidinger, Deutsche BA's spokesman, said that by next year London, Paris, Zurich, Spain and Italy would be served. Once long-range aircraft were available, the new airline would also fly to North America and the Far East from Munich and Berlin. By the end of March 1993, the first trading year, the new airline plans DM200m (Dollars 131.5m) in ticket sales. Mr Leidinger said that while Deutsche BA was a low-cost carrier it was not a 'low-price' one and would charge the same fares as Lufthansa. 'Our difference will be in product and service,' he said. Meals would be served for the first time on all routes. Since cutting costs was a priority, it was made clear from the start that personnel would not be hired directly from BA's high-cost internal German service. Advertisements were run in German newspapers and out of 180 BA cabin staff only five stewardesses applied and were hired by Deutsche BA. Some 240 of BA's staff in Berlin were made redundant, although BA will continue to employ more than 700 people in Germany because of a passenger handling contract it signed with Deutsche BA. Wages of Deutsche BA's pilots and stewardesses are a notch below those paid even by Sudflug, a low-cost subsidiary of Lufthansa's Condor charter airline, according to Mr Leidinger. Lufthansa, the German loss-making state-controlled carrier, is responding by putting its domestic services into a new airline, Lufthansa Express, from November. Lufthansa Express will be a separate profit centre and may eventually be formed into a separate company. At first, it will take over the most heavily used Lufthansa routes and then the parent airline's entire domestic service by next April, using 65 to 70 aircraft. Lufthansa said that the airline hoped to achieve significant cost savings to eliminate the DM350m loss last year on the German domestic service. Staff costs are to be cut by offering Lufthansa personnel, who face a wave of redundancies in the near future, jobs for less pay with the new airline. Aircraft and crews will always return to their home base at the end of the day, cutting out accommodation costs. And quick check-in procedures, tight controls on costly delays and the use of flexible pricing are all being tried to help make Lufthansa Express a lean and hungry division of its still-lumbering parent.</p>

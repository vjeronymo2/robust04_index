			<p>931102 FT  02 NOV 93 / Survey of Corporate Treasury Management (5): Banks may be over-estimating the effect - New US rules will shake up securities accounting A NEW accounting rule that comes into effect in January in the US will require banks and corporate treasurers to take a closer look at securities held in portfolio, and account for them according to the institution's long-term investment intentions. The rule is expected to shift a large number of debt securities out of the historical amortised cost basis accounting into market value. Many capital-sensitive companies, particularly banks, are already shuffling portfolios in response to the rule, trading off potentially volatile long-dated debt in favour of short-dated securities. The concern over bond price volatility is considerable, since the Federal Reserve Board in August grudgingly decided to follow up on the accounting rule, known as Federal Accounting Standards Board statement 115, by requiring banks to adjust their equity capital to reflect unrealised gains or losses for securities they hold for sale. FASB 115 establishes three classes of debt securities. Securities that are to be held to maturity can continue to be reported at amortised cost. However, if the institution believes the security might be sold under some circumstances - say, to create liquidity to meet seasonal loan demand - the security must be classified as 'available for sale,' and be valued at the market on a quarterly basis, with unrealised gains and losses affecting the institution's equity position. Securities held for trading purposes, the third category, are reported at market, with unrealised gains and losses going straight to the income statement. Bankers say that many securities traditionally considered as held to maturity will shift to the 'available for sale' category, because the rule discourages the sale of a security classed as held for maturity. The rule says transfers between classifications must be rare and unusual, and any transfers must be accounted for as a sale and repurchase at market. In addition, because FSBE 115 is asymmetrical, and deals only with the asset side of an institution's balance sheet, a security must be classed as 'available for sale' if its price risk is hedged, or if it might be sold to implement an asset-liability management strategy. A sizeable amount of long-term debt that had been safely amortised under the investment category will soon be subject to the whims of the market, which bank managers say will have near-term and intermediate effects on capital. The current environment of low interest rates and rapidly appreciating stocks in the US should benefit a bank's capital position when the initial market valuation occurs. 'Almost anyone who's holding a long bond has a profit in it these days,' notes one institutional money manager. As a result, few companies are expected experience immediate equity mark-downs. However, the lofty levels of both the US bond and stock markets makes these profitable investments highly vulnerable to a market reversal, and introduces the very real risk of capital volatility. Bankers fear that depositors and regulators who use capital as a measure of a bank's soundness will misinterpret market-based capital swings. In fact, even the Fed believes that the rules will force banks to manage their portfolios to avoid dramatic capital shifts, at the expense of profitability or managing interest rate risk. The belief is well-founded. Bankers, when given the choice, invariably choose capital preservation over higher portfolio returns. A secondary concern for US banks is that a variety of regulatory actions, including the price of bank deposit insurance, is linked to an institution's capitalisation level. 'We're concerned that, by forcing capital to rise and fall, FASB's action could trigger a variety of unnecessary penalties and unwise business decisions,' said Mr Donald Ogilvie, executive vice-president of the American Bankers Association. In fact, the bank lobby could be overestimating the effects of the new accounting rule. Many of the smallest US banks continue to act as traditional bankers - making money by lending deposits at higher rates than they pay depositors. If lending is the primary business, a bank's securities portfolio can rightly be classed as investment, and held to maturity, and avoid market valuation. The nation's largest banks will also be prepared for the rule, with many intending to use derivatives to manage market risks and to adjust the maturities in their 'held for sale ' securities. However, many managers are shortening debt maturities. Securities with maturities of four years or less can be put in the 'held to maturity' category with more confidence than a 30-year bond. In the 'available for sale' bucket, a short-dated note is less exposed to a capital shock than a long bond. One unexpected result of the accounting rule may be to shut traditionally long-term municipal borrowers off from their usual investors, and prevent communities from locking in historically low long-term interest rates. In communities where local banks are active buyers of municipal debt, the effect of these portfolio shifts could be to force municipalities to issue short-term debt to finance long-term projects.</p>

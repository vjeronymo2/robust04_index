			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Teaching union calls for above-inflation pay rises Teachers are on a collision course with the government over a pay submission that would mean rises of more than 20 per cent for some over two years. The National Union of Teachers challenged the government's public-sector pay freeze yesterday by calling for a salary increase next year above the rate of inflation, possibly up to 4 per cent. The biggest teaching union's submission to the School Teachers' Review Body, the quango which advises the government on setting teachers' pay, is calling for a 10-point salary scale by 1996. This would range from Pounds 14,750 for a graduate-entry teacher - up 13.5 per cent from the present equivalent starting salary of Pounds 12,999. Pay for a classroom teacher with 10 years' experience should rise to Pounds 27,000 - up 22.3 per cent from the present maximum of Pounds 22,068 without payment for extra responsibilities. The NUT is arguing for a 'significant increase' next year, beating the rate of inflation and combining a lump sum and percentage to boost starting pay. Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary, said the government had breached its own ban on 'catch-up' pay rises when MPs awarded themselves a 4.7 per cent increase. Mr McAvoy warned that his members could take their own steps to cut mounting workload. 'There comes a point where you say it just can't go on,' he said. 'If no one is going to listen to us, we will have to look very carefully and decide which aspects of our work we could discontinue.' With early retirement, teacher absences and stress-related illness at record levels, conditions of service were as important as pay this year, he added. Teachers worked an average 49-hour week, with one in 10 putting in more than 60 hours. The NUT wants the review body, which reports to the government in January, to recommend smaller classes and more supply teachers. The union rejected the government's call for performance-related pay as 'completely inappropriate' for teaching. It wants a two-year deal producing salaries comparable with other non-manual workers and compensating for years in which it says teachers' pay has slipped behind other professions. This year the government imposed the School Teachers' Review Body's recommended 2.9 per cent pay rise. Mr McAvoy said improvements in pay and working conditions were essential to avoid a crisis as the recession eased and numbers of pupils grew. On present projections of pupil numbers, it would take 19,000 more teachers just to keep class sizes the same over the next four years. The submission to the review body from the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers called for a 35-hour-week and a pay increase in line with other non-manual staff. The Secondary Heads Association urged the a pay increase for all teachers 'in recognition of their improved productivity, measured by published examination results'.</p>

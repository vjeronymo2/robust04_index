			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- The head of the government  tax commission, Kan Kato, blasted Tuesday [10 May] as "strange"  U.S. criticism of Japanese plans to cut income taxes and raise  consumption taxes.    It is "simplistic" to argue that writing a later consumption  tax hike into the same legislation that cuts income taxes will  hurt the economy and erase the boost the tax cut should bring,  Kato told a regular news conference after a meeting of the  commission, an advisory panel to the prime minister. "The  American way of thinking is strange," said Kato, a professor  emeritus of economics at Keio University.    U.S. officials have complained about the idea of linking tax  cuts and hikes, saying the knowledge of a coming tax hike would  psychologically cancel the effect of the cut. But Treasury  Secretary Lloyd Bentsen recently indicated the United States  would endorse a linked tax plan if the two measures were  separated by a "substantial time."    Washington wants Tokyo to cut taxes first to boost domestic  demand and thus curb Japan's huge trade surplus. But fiscal  conservatives led by the powerful Finance Ministry insist that  the offsetting financing be locked in before the government cuts  taxes.    Earlier Tuesday, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata vowed to the  tax  commission that he will continue his predecessor Morihiro  Hosokawa's tax overhaul agenda, including "permanent income tax  cuts."    He asked the commission to flesh out its detailed tax  overhaul report next month as planned, "based on the pillar of  lessening personal income taxes and fulfilling taxation on  consumption."    Hata renewed Hosokawa's vow of submitting the tax reform  plan, based on the options proposed by the panel, to parliament  by the end of next month and enacting the legislation this year,  with "the cooperation and understanding of the various parties."    To meet the panel's deadline, Kato said, the members must  consolidate the thrust of their proposals by the end of this  month to allow time for public hearings throughout the country  before compiling the final June report.    Hata asked the panel to "treat the request of former Prime  Minister Hosokawa as my request." Hosokawa had also said  Japan's net tax burden must grow to meet the coming needs of the  nation's graying society.    But Kato said a net tax increase has not emerged as a  consensus view in the panel, although some members favor an  overall increase in taxation for social welfare spending.    Kato also confirmed that some members argue for a multi-rate  consumption tax, that would tax such necessities as food at a  lower rate than other items. But he said it has not emerged as  a formal panel option, as reported Tuesday in the NIHON KEIZAI  SHIMBUN.</p>

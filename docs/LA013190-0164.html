			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> RACING TEAM ORDERED TO PAY FINE  </P> <P> The McLaren-Honda racing team must pay a $100,000 fine imposed on driver Ayrton  Senna by Thursday or lose its license to compete in Formula One racing, the  sport's ruling body said today.  </P> <P> A letter from Yvon Leon, secretary general of the International Auto Sports  Federation (FISA), said McLaren's license would be suspended until the fine is  paid.  </P> <P> McLaren, whose cars have won world championships in four of the last six  seasons, has been feuding with FISA since November when Senna was fined for  misconduct.  </P> <P> On Monday, FISA President Jean-Marie Balestre said Senna will not be granted a  license to compete in Formula One unless he retracts allegations that last  year's championship was manipulated in favor of Frenchman Alain Prost, at the  time his McLaren teammate. Senna, a Brazilian, won the 1988 drivers' world  championship but finished second last year to Prost, who moved to Ferrari at  the end of the season.  </P></p>

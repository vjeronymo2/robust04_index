			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Ma Zhiping: "85 Percent Rise in Technical Service </F> Companies"]    [Text] Scientific research and technological services are  in demand. Last year, the number of firms engaged in such  activity jumped by 85 per cent.    By the end of last year, 98,000 firms were involved in  scientific services, statistics from the State Administration  for Industry and Commerce indicated. Public health, sports, and  welfare services also grew, as the number of firms in these  areas grew 54 per cent over 1992.    Tertiary firms and companies in the fields of geological  prospecting, education, art and culture, real estate,  residential community services, and consulting also increased.    "This shows that the tertiary industry is developing  smoothly" said officials with the State administration, which is  in charge of issuing business licences.    However, transportation, postal and telecommunications,  finance, and insurance services have failed to grow at a similar  rate, the statistics indicated.    "The tertiary industry has great potential for development,"  the officials said, predicting that the country's service sector  will develop rapidly in the coming years.    By the end of last year, 7.28 million enterprises employing  252 million workers were registered at the State administration  and its local branches.    In 1993, they had a record 4,236 billion yuan ($486.9  billion) in registered capital, surpassing the 2,780 billion  yuan ($319.5 billion) set in the previous year.    Never before in China's history have the number of  enterprises grown so rapidly.    Among the country's enterprises, 5.02 million are engaged in  tertiary industry, about 70 per cent of the total.    The average amount of capital registered by service sector  corporations was about 1 million yuan ($114,942), a 9 percent  rise over 1992.    Hainan Province, Beijing, and Shanghai were hot spots for  such firms. They listed 2.38 million yuan ($0.27 million), 1.22  million yuan, and 1.17 million yuan in registered capital  respectively.    While more than 1.83 million new enterprises and firms  opened  for business last year, some 340,000 companies folded--33 per  cent more than in 1992--indicating increasing competition  nationwide.</p>

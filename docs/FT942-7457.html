			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: Varity first-quarter income up at Dollars 29m Varity Corporation, which makes braking systems and diesel engines for cars and trucks, reported a rise in first-quarter net income to Dollars 29.4m, or 65 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 505.8m. This compares with Dollars 11m, or 20 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 455.6m in last year's first quarter to April 30. During the quarter, Varity agreed to sell its remaining Massey Ferguson farm equipment operations to Agco for Dollars 310m in cash and 500,000 shares of Agco stock. The sale should bring an income gain of between Dollars 15m and Dollars 30m and increase Varity's stockholders' equity by about Dollars 100m. Varity's first-quarter income, excluding Massey Ferguson's results, was Dollars 25m, or 55 cents, up from a comparable Dollars 15.1m, or 33 cents, a year ago. Massey Ferguson saw net income rising to Dollars 4m, against a net loss of Dollars 4m a year ago. Sales were Dollars 253m, up from Dollars 189m last year. Varity's remaining businesses benefited from a 9 per cent increase in North American vehicle production.</p>

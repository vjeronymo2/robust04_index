			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / The spirit of glasnost reaches the Highlands: Local Enterprise Companies are trying a policy of openness in handing out grants The West Highland Free Press, a weekly newspaper, reported recently that Mrs Jean Threlfall of Ardvasar in Skye had been given a grant of Pounds 400 for her business breeding Skye terriers. The money was spent on new kennels. Last month the paper recorded that the fish processor Johnston Seafayre of Stornoway, Lewis, had been granted Pounds 42,000 for working capital, and that Lady Clare Macdonald, the Skye hotelier and cookery writer, had been given Pounds 4,500 to expand her cookery demonstration business. These and countless other modest pieces of news have been appearing regularly in newspapers in northern Scotland since April, when the 10 Local Enterprise Companies (Lecs) which have been operating in the area for three years adopted a policy of almost total disclosure of their activities. No longer can the Highland Lecs, the employer-led economic development bodies, cite 'commercial confidentiality' as a reason for keeping most transactions secret, unless the release of information would harm a company's competitive position. Each month the Lecs produce a list of businesses and people to whom they have given grants, even down to individuals receiving training grants, and newspapers are free to publish it. The policy, called 'accountability through openness', was introduced by the Lecs and their parent body, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, in response to criticism that the Lecs were unaccountable to the people they served. The same claim is made about the Lecs reporting to Scottish Enterprise in the Lowlands, as well as about the Training and Enterprise Councils, which deliver government training schemes in England and Wales and have a development role. Critics, notably in the Labour party, argue that none of the people on the boards of Lecs or Tecs has had to face democratic election, and that they use the 'figleaf' of commercial confidentiality to conceal what they are doing. In Scotland there is a widespread perception that the Lecs, with their boards largely composed of businessmen, are a kind of old boy's club, occasionally handing out public money in grants and loans to businesses which involve the directors themselves. Lecs certainly do have dealings with companies run by their directors, but such transactions are governed by strict rules. However, the problem of conflicts of interest is particularly acute in the Highlands because most Lecs cover areas with only a few thousand inhabitants. High-profile local businessmen sit on the boards of their Lecs and some also have commercial dealings with them, although these must be arranged at arm's length and declared in the Lec's annual report. HIE acknowledges that 'it has taken time to gain local support for the Lecs', but points out that the network has suffered 'no instance whatsoever of misdealing involving Lec directors'. As it is unable to do anything about its structure, which is accountable to parliament through the Scottish secretary, it is trying to achieve broader accountability by being open about its activities. Caithness and Sutherland Enterprise started its own glasnost six months before the policy was adopted by the rest of the network. It produces a 10-page monthly overview and a full list of grants. Mr Neil Money, deputy chief executive, said: 'What we wanted was make people aware of what we do. We tell people when they apply for grants their names will be published, though we say we'll withhold them for a time if it's commercially sensitive. 'There's no evidence that people have been put off from applying. In fact the reverse is the case. People have come to us because they have discovered grants are available.' Mr Iain Robertson, chief executive of HIE, believes that the openness policy is assisting economic development. He said: 'People look at the lists and they read what's going on in their areas, they get ideas and they come to us for help. It's opening up the Highlands.' But although Mr Henry McLeish, deputy shadow Scottish secretary, says that 'in principle' he would favour the same openness policy being adopted by Lecs in the Lowlands, Scottish Enterprise says the idea is 'not appropriate'. It points out that a large part of the activity of the Highland Lecs consists of handing out relatively small grants, many of them only available to people and businesses in the region because of its special needs. This type of activity, they say, makes up only a tiny fraction of the activity of Lecs in lowland Scotland, which are mainly involved in large-scale training, and in striking agreements with private-sector companies in areas such as property development, the creation of new products, and attracting investors. In those cases it believes commercial confidentiality is usually essential. Mr Des Bonnar, chief executive of Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise, said: 'It's a question of balancing transparency with effectiveness and acting as reliable partners of private sector companies. 'Would you do a deal with a company which told you that the transaction would automatically be in the public domain by the end of the month?' For Mr McLeish, the attitude of Scottish Enterprise typifies 'a culture of secrecy which is bringing it more criticism than it actually deserves'.</p>

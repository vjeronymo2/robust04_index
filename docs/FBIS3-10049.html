The 500 workers also continued to collect signatures for a  petition rejecting an adjustment bill, to be presented to  trustee Juan Schiaretti on 20 March, that sparked violent riots  here late last year. Union sources said that teachers were  upset about differences in salaries paid to staff doing the same  job. The sources added that there is no salary scale to go by  in the province for teachers and other state workers. Teachers  unions also said that the 20 percent bonus paid to teachers with  more than 20 years on the job had been cancelled by the  government here.</p>

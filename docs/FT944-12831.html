			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Management: Of fish 'eads, baked beans and cola There are signs, say researchers, of a tilt in consumer sentiment away from cut-price, own-label goods and back towards higher-priced branded ones. But the 'demanding consumer' - acutely value-conscious and sceptical about advertising claims - is now said to be a fixture of the retail landscape. That sounds correct to me, though I find myself moving in the opposite direction to the general mood. For example, I have boycotted own-label food products for years. This followed a visit, one freezing morning, to a scene from hell: a processing plant in Hull where fishwives working for a famous food manufacturer were gutting and filleting the catch. My fur coat made them giggle. I approached one of the women. She was placing each brilliantly-sliced fillet in a tray packed with ice and throwing the head, tail and bones into a bucket at her elbow. I said: 'What's the bucket for?' She replied that the scraps in the bucket were used by her employer to make own-label fish-fingers for a supermarket chain. I said I found that shocking. She said: 'You've 'ardly lived, my robin. There's nothing wrong with 'eads.' After that I ignored own-label products, believing, in any case, what marketing folk told me: that the higher prices charged by makers of branded goods reflected what they said they did: superior product development and quality as trumpeted, expensively, in their advertising campaigns. Yet own-label products have got better and better. Today, almost all my supermarket purchases of commodity-type items are retailers' own-label. Some weeks ago I had lunch with David Sainsbury, chairman of J Sainsbury, Britain's leading grocery chain. I discovered that we both do our supermarket shopping at the same branch of Sainsbury's, the one near Notting Hill. I find this supremely comforting because it strikes me that the ferocity of the price-cutting and the IQ of the staff are likely to be most pronounced in the branch of Sainsbury's round which the man who owns 17 per cent of the shares is wont to push his trolley. I asked Sainsbury about his public row with Coca-Cola over Sainsbury's look-alike own-label cola. Coke had claimed, crossly, that the look-alike's packaging imitated its own too flatteringly. Sainsbury was vivaciously unrepentant. 'Fifty-five per cent of our (packaged grocery) sales are own-label,' he said. 'We have always been in the business of finding better-value products than the branded ones. For the first time a cola has been found that is as good as Coca-Cola. That is a new situation for Coke.' And a worrying one, too. Today, every Tom, Dick and Harry has his own cola. To survive, owners of commodity-type brands (not just grocery ones) will have to raise their game. The other morning I was round at Sainsbury's, studying the shelf-space devoted to baked beans. What I saw was a continuing death-struggle between Heinz and Sainsbury's own brand. Heinz offers a few lacklustre variants, including baked beans with bacon or with eight pork sausages. But nothing remotely hip. Why doesn't Heinz give us baked beans with truffles, or with goose leg? The president of Heinz is Tony O'Reilly. Next time you see him, ask him what he's doing. Hugo Boss, Germany's leading maker of 'upscale' menswear, has a thrusting chief executive: Peter Littmann, 46. Littmann is astute, but he ought to study some of the promotional material pumped out by corporate HQ in Metzingen. It is some of the wackiest stuff imaginable - a terrifying example of what might emerge if you hooked up 10 word processors in your marketing department to 10 word processors in your PR agency and let them get on with it. Littmann's career has included broadcasting, film-making, carpets, porcelain. In March last year he was made boss of Hugo Boss, and five months later split the Boss range into three distinct brands. They are called HUGO Hugo Boss, BOSS Hugo Boss, and BALDESSARINI Hugo Boss, after the chief designer. HUGO Hugo Boss is for younger customers; BOSS Hugo Boss focuses on business-wear; and BALDESSARINI Hugo Boss is positioned as a top-flight range of hand-tailored clothes. HUGO Hugo Boss man and BOSS Hugo Boss man are reasonably exotic dudes. But the most exotic dude is BALDESSARINI Hugo Boss man. According to the word processors, BALDESSARINI Hugo Boss man has 'charisma and sovereign ways . . . He is cosmopolitan and conservative, whether he is an executive or a successful artist with a passion for perfection . . . He shows a marked interest in culture; his sports - golf, yachting, hunting - are as distinguished as his lifestyle.' On and on it goes, indefatigably, a mish-mash of images, utterly surreal. They call this marketing? Littmann should sprint round HQ and rip all the plugs out. Things need to cool down at Hugo Boss.</p>

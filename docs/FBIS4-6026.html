			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 15 April editorial: "Our Revolution Which Is </F> Advancing With the Harmonious Unity of the Leader and People  Will Always Be Victorious"]    [Text] Today in our country the leader [suryong] and  people are in harmonious unity [honyon ilche] and are  victoriously advancing the chuche socialist cause. We are  meaningfully marking the respected and beloved leader's birthday  at a time when all people's resolve and will to complete the  socialist cause to the end under the leadership of the party and  the leader [suryong] have been further consolidated and when the  honor and dignity of our fatherland, which is advancing under  the uplifted banner of chuche, are displayed vigorously.    Our people and revolutionary people of the world are now  celebrating the felicitous festival of April with great joys and  emotion and extending the greatest honor to the great leader  Comrade Kim Il-song.    The respected and beloved leader's birth is the most  significant historic event in which the people's great sun rose  and a great festive event never before seen in the long history  spanning 5,000 years.    The proud history, in which our people have demonstrated  lofty dignity as the masters of their own destinies after being  united in close ties of kinship with the leader [suryong], and  our fatherland's brilliant future are linked to this honorable  day.    As time passes and as the revolution advances far, our  people's hearts are more and more filled with great national  pride in upholding the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and a  warm sense of loyalty and filial devotion with which to better  serve [tojal mosigo] the leader [suryong] and uphold the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's leadership.    Throughout the long period from the day when he embarked on  the revolutionary road, the respected and beloved leader Comrade  Kim Il- song has devoted himself to promoting the people's  freedom and happiness. Throughout this long period, only the  people have existed in the great leader's heart, and our leader  [suryong] has always existed in our people's hearts. Today in  our country this harmonious unity between the leader [suryong]  and people is being further consolidated into an unbreakable  one. This gives our people a belief in certain victory and  boundless strength and firmly guarantees the bright future of  the cause of socialism of our own style.    Harmonious unity between the leader [suryong] and the people  is the greatest achievement in the Korean revolution and the  source of the invincible strength of the socialism of our own  style. A fundamental key to victory in socialist construction  and confrontation with the imperialists is harmonious unity  between the leader [suryong] and the people. The leader  [suryong] is the popular masses' top brain [choego noesu] and  the leader [yongdoja] of the revolution, and the people are the  masters of revolution and construction and those in charge of  revolution and construction.    The people can display their boundless strength as powerful  main forces of the revolution, defeat any powerful enemy, and  vigorously carry out revolution and construction when they  achieve harmonious unity with the leader [suryong].    From the cultivating period of our revolution up until  today,  our people have resolutely waged struggles while upholding the  great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and strongly uniting around the  leader [suryong].    The entire history in which our revolution was cultivated  and  advanced is brilliant as a proud annals in which harmonious  unity was achieved between the leader [suryong] and the  revolutionary warriors and the leader [suryong] and the people  and in which victories were won based on the strength of such  unity.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has pointed out: Since  our revolution began, the Korean communists firmly believed that  they can cultivate the turbulent road of the revolution only  when they uphold the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in the  forefront and walked along the road of struggle and victory  after overcoming all trials. They have also entrusted their  entire destinies to the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and  lived and fought with single- hearted loyalty toward the leader  [suryong] though they might live even for a moment.    The Korean revolution has embarked upon an ardent and  complicated road ever since its beginning.    Since the beginning of Comrade Kim Il-song's revolutionary  activities, the great leader has always trusted in the people  and found himself among them leading the revolution. As a  result, he has unreservedly displayed the qualities and traits  of the great leader of the people.    Thanks to the greatness, prominent leadership traits, and  lofty personality of the respected and beloved leader [suryong],  the Korean communists and people have been able to forecast the  victory of the revolution, as well as their future and have been  able to trust and follow him as the savior of their destinies.    The great leader [suryong] believes in the people and the  latter trust and follow him. The bonds between the leader  [suryong] and the people are those of kinship between the father  and his children. Also, so unbreakable are their bonds that  make it possible to do anything under any harsh circumstances.  Thus, from the beginning, our revolution has began with  harmonious unity between the leader [suryong] and the people and  has traversed a brilliant course by its might.    The harmonious unity between the leader [suryong] and the  people is a great driving force that has constantly led our  revolution and construction to become ever-victorious by  withstanding the harsh storm of history.    The revolution is accompanied by difficulties and trials.  Because there is the harmonious unity between the leader  [suryong] and the people, we can boldly defeat any imperialist  powerful enemy, as well as overcome harsh difficulties under all  circumstances. This is the truth that has been proven in the  long and ardent history of our revolution.    Our people had no other choice but to pioneer their  destinies  by confronting other powerful enemies all the time under the  most disadvantageous and ardent situations. In this harsh  course, there was once a difficult time that determines the  destiny of the revolution, as well as periods in which we should  carry out the vast and heavy tasks. However, we have been able  to embark upon the single road of victory all the time without  the slightest faltering as a result of the invincible unity and  cohesion of our people who are firmly united around the  respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song.    Whenever we have a difficult time, the respected and beloved  leader Comrade Kim Il-song has trusted our people and solved all  problems with them. Also, our people have fought against  enemies by entrusting their destines to the leader [suryong],  thus respecting him.    If we had not had the harmonious unity, in which the leader  [suryong] and the people are firmly united, we would not have  defeated the imperialists during the two rounds of wars against  them, nor smashed [punswae] enemies' plots, nor effected the  great upsurge of Chollima during the difficult period of the  postwar, nor established the socialist power -- independent,  self-reliant, and self-defensive -- on this land.    Experience shows that the harmonious unity between the  leader  [suryong] and the people have a boundless might that makes it  possible to defeat all powerful enemies and to effect a greater  upturn in the socialist construction. The harmonious unity  between the leader [suryong] and the people is a great might in  resolutely safeguarding and adhering to socialism of our own  style today.    We are now carrying out the revolution and construction by  acutely confronting the imperialists. The imperialists are now  viciously maneuvering to isolate and crush [apsal] our country  -- a fortress of socialism -- throughout all areas, such as  politics, military affairs, the economy, and diplomacy. The  single-hearted unity between the leader [suryong], the party,  and the masses are, however, further strengthened.    Now, our party and the revolutionary ranks have cherished a  firm faith that one will surely win a victory only if one  vigorously fights on under the leadership of the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong- il, thus upholding the great leader Comrade  Kim Il-song. Our people today are the invincible people who  have a firm faith and determination to endlessly share their  destinies with the leader [suryong], thus cherishing deep in  their hearts the greatness of their leader [suryong].    Because all people are firmly united around the leader  [suryong] and the leader [yongdoja] with their burning faith to  resolutely safeguard their leader [suryong] and their leader  [yongdoja], we have boldly smashed [chippusida] any threat,  blackmail, and maneuvers of aggression by the imperialists and  have firmly safeguarded the socialist feats, as well as the  nation's dignity and honor. This is a great demonstration of  the invincible might displayed by the harmonious unity between  the leader [suryong] and the people.    It is the great pride of the Korean communist movement to  have established the harmonious unity between the leader and the  people early in the opening-up period of our revolution and to  have advanced the revolution and construction with the might of  the unity.    The might of the harmonious unity between the leader and the  people that has highly been displayed in our revolution lies,  above all, in the fact that the leader and the people have  become a community bound firmly together into a single life by  common fate.    The leader and the people are linked with each other by  common fate. In the revolutionary struggle, the leader is the  pioneer and protector of the people's destinies, and the people  are an invincible fortress that protects and defends the leader.  The revolutionary rank can demonstrate its limitless strength  when relations between the leader and the people are not only  those between a leader and his followers, but also those linked  by blood, in which they share life and death.    The whole course of the arduous and well-tried Korean  revolution is literally a course in which the leader and the  people have struggled while sharing sorrow and joy and  entrusting their destinies and future to each other.    The respected and beloved leader has trusted the  revolutionary fighters and the people from his heart and  regarded their destinies as his own, saying that always only a  true heart can fuse our blood and the people's blood in an  artery, while the people have absolutely trusted, resolutely  protected, and defended the leader as the center of their lives  and as their supreme head [choego noesu].    The Korean revolutionaries and people have fought by  devoting  their lives without hesitation to shield the respected and  beloved leader against the enemy's bombshell with their hearts.  This is their lofty trait.    This exalted ideological and spiritual world can be  personified only by faithful revolutionaries who identify not  only their faith, will, ideology, and emotion but also their  private thoughts with their leader's. This trait was the  ideological and spiritual source of the creation and  consolidation of the inseparable, harmonious unity between the  leader and the people.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is leading the people  along the single road of socialism today, too, holding the  responsibility of their destinies to the last, and the people  are fighting with a firm faith to entrust their destinies to the  party and the leader and to follow them to the end of the world.  Because of this identity of fate, the harmonious unity between  the leader and the people has constantly been consolidated and  developed in our country.    The might of the harmonious unity between the leader and the  people also lies in the fact that they are a community bound  together by common ideology and will. The most important tie  that links the leader and the people is the identity of  ideology. When the leader elucidates the victorious course of  the revolution and renders ideological leadership, the people  come to uphold the leader as their teacher and firmly unite  themselves based on his ideology.    Since the creation of the immortal chuche idea by the great  leader Comrade Kim Il-song in an early stage through a  scientific envisagement of the demand of the times and the  people's desire, our people have stoutly struggled with this  revolutionary idea as a firm faith and as the only banner of  unity. In those days of the struggle, our people learned by  keen experience that they can achieve the prosperity of the  fatherland and the victory of the revolution only by fighting  along the road indicated by the respected and beloved leader,  and they have upheld the leader as their great teacher.    The linkage between the leader and the people has been  guaranteed by the ideological identity of sharing will and  destinies based on the chuche idea. Today, thanks to the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il who has constantly developed to  complete the chuche idea, our people's ideological identity is  being consolidated even further.    Our party and the revolutionary ranks are the community of  chuche-type revolutionaries -- who struggle with the leader's  revolutionary ideology, the chuche idea, as a firm faith --  bound together by ideology and will. All party members and  working people breathe, speak, and act only in conformity with  our party's ideology and will.    When the party and the leader present a new line or policy,  the entire party and all people rise as one to live and struggle  according only to it. Thus, the harmonious unity between the  leader and the people has limitless strength.    The might of the harmonious unity between the leader and the  people also lies in the fact that it has been succeeded,  developed, and consolidated through generations so as to  consummate the socialist cause.    Blood unity between the leader [suryong] and the people  was and is very important and will be all the more important.  The people wage struggles after strongly uniting around the  leader [suryong] in order to complete the revolution to the end.  As the revolution deepens and develops today in our country,  harmonious unity between the leader [suryong] and the people is  being further consolidated.    The entire party, all the people, and the entire Army are  vigorously fighting after strongly uniting around the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. It shows that the harmonious unity  between the leader [suryong] and the people, which was formed  and consolidated and developed historically, has eternal  vitality and is brilliantly inherited. Through their actual  experiences and realities all party members and workers have  come to have the belief that they can enjoy worthwhile and happy  lives and complete the socialist cause to the end when they  uphold the dear comrade leader. They also entrust their entire  destinies to the party and the leader [suryong]. As a result,  our revolutionary rank takes pride in the fact that it is an  invincible combatant rank that has achieved strong unity based  on a single goal and aspiration and a single idea and will and  advances to complete the chuche cause. The noble revolutionary  spirit, with which this rank is filled, is the revolutionary  belief and strong will that the rank, just like the fallen  anti-Japanese revolutionaries who fought by even unhesitatingly  risking their lives to resolutely defend the great leader,  upholds the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and fights forever.  Thanks to this, harmonious unity between the leader [suryong]  and the people highly demonstrates its boundless might in our  country as time goes by. This provides our fatherland and  revolution with bright prospects.    When we recall the long history of the communist movement,  the most solid harmonious unity between the leader [suryong] and  the people is achieved only in the Korean revolution, which is  led by the great leader. A crucial key to the achievement of  this invincible unity is the greatness and nobleness of the  ideas, leadership, and virtue of the respected and beloved  leader, the great father [widaehan oboi] of our party members  and workers and our fellow countrymen.    The source of the solidity of our harmonious unity is the  respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song's idea of  believing in the people as in heaven. The idea of believing in  the people as in heaven, an idea that one considers the people  to be heaven, is an opinion and motto that the great leader  cherishes in the entire course of revolution and construction.  The chuche idea's profound principle that one considers the  popular masses to be the masters of revolution and construction  and relies on their strength comes from idea of believing in the  people as in heaven. The chuche-oriented theories and  leadership methods also come from this idea.    In resolving any issues concerning revolution and  construction, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has given  priority to the people's interests, had their aspirations and  demands reflected on all lines and policies, and made all  efforts to implement those aspirations and demands. The idea of  believing in the people as in heaven is reflected on all lines  and policies Kim Il-song presented historically, from the lines  on building the party, the country, and the Army, which he  presented at the early stage of building new society, and to the  party's revolutionary economic strategy today.    The revolutionary strategies and tactics which the great  leader Comrade Kim Il-song present for the sake of the popular  masses; the people-oriented policies; the favors which the party  and the leader [suryong] do each family and each individual on  an equal basis give rise to the people's absolute trust for the  party and the leader [suryong] and strongly connect the party  and the people in a single artery.    Just like the idea of believing in the people as in heaven  is  eternal, our solid harmonious unity which was achieved based on  this great idea will not shake. The most solid blood ties  between the leader [suryong] and the people were formed in our  country because the achievements which the respected and beloved  leader has brought about in the struggle for the popular masses'  cause of independence are great.    A great leader [yongdoja] wins respect and trust from the  people not because someone stands him in front; he does so  because of his own achievements. Numerous boundlessly difficult  and massive tasks never before seen in history were presented in  our people's struggle for sovereignty and independence. In the  long revolutionary course, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song  has led every stage and type of struggle to victory in order to  carry out the cause of independence in our era. And, in this  process, he has brought about immortal achievements, which will  remain brilliant forever in the history of mankind, in  political, economic, political, and cultural fields and all the  other fields.    The achievements of building the chuche-type party and the  people's government, which responsibly take care of the popular  masses' destinies; the achievements of building the people's  genuine revolutionary armed forces, which defend the people's  freedom and happiness; the achievements of raising our people  into revolutionary people who have a strong sense of  independence; the achievements of building popular  masses-centered socialism of our own style in this land where  only backwardness and poverty prevailed; and all the other  achievements which the respected and beloved leader has brought  about win admiration from all people.    The history of any other country in the East or West or in  the past or present age has not seen a leader [yongdoja] like  our respected and beloved leader, who has brought all historic  achievements for the people as best as he can and raised the  people's position to the peak of the era.    The achievements which the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song  has brought about are immortal achievements which he has brought  about for the people while riding out the road of arduous  struggle with the people.    In bringing about these achievements, the respected and  beloved leader has faced all hardships that a revolutionary may  face and has overcome trials and difficulties.    During the days of the anti-Japanese struggle, he personally  took the lead in the arduous march to break through the line of  death and find a way out; after the liberation, he first  embarked on the road toward building the country; and today,  when he is over 80 years old, is giving on-the-spot guidance to  plants and enterprises and farms across the country and devoting  himself to giving greater happiness to our people. This  devotion to and sleepless and restless efforts for the  fatherland and people by the respected and beloved leader is  incomparable to anyone else's. Therefore, every time they think  of the great leader's achievements for them, our people  consolidate their determination to better serve the leader  [suryong] with loyalty, devotion, and single-mindedness.    The most solid harmonious unity between the leader [suryong]  and the people was achieved in our country because the respected  and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song's virtue is great and  because his people-oriented trait is boundlessly noble.    A great politician has noble virtue, and the people become  happy because of such a virtue. The respected and beloved  leader's politics is the politics of love and trust and that of  virtue.    The great leader, who started the revolution by winning  comrades, has not hesitated to face any hardship if it were for  his comrades and people, considered having many comrades to be  the most important asset, and considered winning love and trust  from the people to be the greatest happiness. In this way, he  has written the most beautiful annals of revolutionary  comradeship and human love.    Millions of members of our party rank were raised amid the  respected and beloved leader's revolutionary comradeship and  human love, and single-hearted unity was achieved in the entire  society in which all people are strongly united based on  comradely love and revolutionary moral obligation.    The respected and beloved leader's is a great bosom that  amazes all people and leads them into a single worthwhile  revolutionary road.    The boundless love in trusting anyone who has embarked on a  revolutionary road and leading him to a worthwhile struggle; the  boundless magnanimity in embracing even those who have different  political views, religions, or classes and leading them to a  noble patriot road; and the generosity in leading even those who  have committed mistakes on a revolutionary road to make a fresh  start and responsibly taking care of their destinies to the end:  This is the nature of the great leader.    Captivated by this character of the great leader Comrade Kim  Il- song, who is a human being of human beings and a politician  of politicians, the revolutionary warriors follow him, the  people follow him, and all fellow countrymen follow him.    The respected and beloved leader, who is best in ideology,  best in achievements, and best in virtue, is truly the eternal  sun for the survival of our people and nation.    Today our people have an honorable and rewarding task of  further solidifying the ties of kinship with their leader  [suryong] and their leader [yongdoja] and vigorously  accelerating the general onward march of our-style socialism  with the might of wholehearted unity.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has noted: We should  attach the greatest importance to the unity and cohesion of the  party and the popular masses, strengthen and develop it onto a  higher plane, and make the party a mighty party taking deeper  root in the popular masses.    The wholehearted unity of the leader, the party, and the  people has been and will be the life line of our style socialism  and the ever-victorious banner. We must make the road of our  revolution's onward march a history of the strongest ties of  kinship between the leader [suryong] and the people and between  the leader [yongdoja] and the fighter. To do this, all the  party members and working people should, above all, unite around  the party and the leader with the great pride in being blessed  with the happiness of having the leader.    The greatest happiness of the people is enjoying the  leadership of the great leader [widaehan suryong] who has  brilliant wisdom, outstanding leadership, and noble virtue.  Their greatest misfortune is having a wrong leader [kajang kun  purhaengun yongdojarul chalmot mannanungosida]. This is well  proven by the long history of the international communist  movement and today's reality. Socialism, which was built over  decades, fell in many countries, and the people in those  countries are in distress. The fundamental cause of this was  that they did not have the leader who is faithful to the cause  of socialism and the people.    Our people are a proud people who have always lived enjoying  the tested leadership of the great leader [suryong] and the  great leader [yongdoja] throughout the entire period of the  revolution and construction. Upholding the respected and  beloved Comrade Kim Il-song, our people have been able to  display their glory of a great people who have traversed the  road of independence and socialism without deviation. Upholding  the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, they are able to display  their pride in being a happy people inheriting and completing  the cause of the revolution most brilliantly.    The greatest blessing our people enjoy is the blessing of  having the leader. Greeting the festive 15 April holiday, we  must bear this happiness deeper in our hearts and renew our  resolve to devote ourselves to the party and the leader with  utmost loyalty and filial duty.    We must have a firm faith that we will never fail to be  victorious because we have the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il--the general of generals who is skilled in both  literary and military arts and tames a fierce head wind--as the  great leader [yongdoja] of our party and people and as the  supreme commander of the revolutionary armed forces, and crush  any maneuvers of the imperialists resolutely with a  revolutionary offensive.    Because we are blessed with the happiness of having the  leader, we must be loyal and dutiful to the leader. The faith  in and the revolutionary volition to the leader--this is a warm  conscience not forgetting the benevolence of the leader who has  brought us up as a revolutionary and who has given us true life,  and it is a firm revolutionary principle of not deserting our  pledge to the leader even in a solitary island in the distant  sea or on a guillotine. The ties of kinship with our leader are  more firmly connected and unbreakable by this faith and fidelity.    All the party members and working people must not only  cherish their loyalty to the great leader and the dear comrade  leader as their firm faith but make it their conscience,  morality, and life so that they can firmly prepare themselves to  be loyalists and dutiful children not knowing any change of mind.    Resolutely adhering and adding luster to our-style  socialism,  which was built by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and led  by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is the loftiest duty of  all the party members and working people. In the superior  chuche socialist system and in all the gains of the revolution  built in this land are the labors of the respected and beloved  leader Comrade Kim Il-song which he devoted in the long and  arduous path of the revolution, as well as the blood and  perspiration of the revolutionary martyrs who were boundlessly  loyal to the leader. No matter what complicated situation may  be created against us and no matter what trials may overtake us,  we can never give up these gains or allow them to be damaged.    With unswerving confidence in the correctness and future  of the chuche-based socialist cause pioneered on our own, all  the people should more firmly bear the revolutionary  determination to follow the road of socialism to the end under  the leadership of respected and beloved supreme commander  General Kim Chong-il.    All the party members and working people should invariably  implement revolutionary lines and principles, including the line  of three revolutions, construction of self-reliant national  economy, and the military line of self-reliance which have been  consistently adhered to by the great leader and the comrade dear  leader, and should further vigorously accelerate the general  march movement of socialism of our own style.    We should manifest the might of socialism of our own style  to  the whole world by marking a new advance in the struggle to  implement the party's revolutionary economic strategy while  highly displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and  fortitude. Consolidating our party and people's single-hearted  unity centered around the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il into  an impregnable fortress is a firm guarantee for inheriting and  completing the chuche-based socialist cause to the end.    All functionaries and party members should inherit our  revolution's tradition of single-hearted unity, always bear in  mind the great leader's teaching that we should strengthen  reunification and cohesion with the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il as the center, and regard the teaching as a firm  guidance to all party works and activities.    As did the anti-Japanese revolutionary martyrs, who had the  great Comrade Hanbyol as the center of the cohesion and  leadership and staunchly defended him in the past, we should  defend our destiny and defender Comrade Kim Chong-il as bullets  and gun shells to the end.    We should strengthen the ranks' principal cohesion based on  the faithfulness toward the party and the leader and  revolutionary comradeship, and make our society a big family  with the great leader and the dear leader as our father, and  develop it as a warm society where everyone helps and leads each  other as real brothers.    More than 80 years have passed since the great sun rose in  the dark sky of Korea. What our people have invariably kept in  their minds during the meaningful days when the most significant  incidents of the 20th century took place is the enthusiastic  wish to uphold the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song for  thousands and tens of thousands of years until the sun and the  moon vanish.    Our people's respect grows as more new records are added to  the chronicle of the chuche cause. With the great pride and  self- confidence of upholding the great leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il -- the most experienced leader of our times -- our  people will vigorously fight on to complete the chuche-based  socialist cause.    Our revolutionary cause, which is vigorously advancing with  the harmonious unity between the great leader and the great  people, is forever victorious and indomitable.</p>

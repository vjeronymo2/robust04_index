			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Boardroom bestsellers: FT writers give their verdict on the year's best business books This has been a disappointing year for business books. There were few interesting titles and even fewer books which did their subject justice. Here is a subjective selection of business publications which FT correspondents have read and enjoyed. They are often concerned with analysing and learning from the managerial and financial failures of the 1980s. For several of the books, any drift towards the intellectually lightweight tends to be offset by sheer physical bulk. The best financial book of the year was Money of the Mind - Borrowing and Lending in America from the Civil War to Michael Milken (Farrar Straus Giroux, Dollars 27.50) by James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer. Although there is nothing new about debt-financed bubbles, Grant argues that the rapid economic expansion in the US in the 1980s, financed largely by borrowing, was unique. Two important trends converged in the period: the democratisation of lending and the socialisation of risk. Increasing numbers of people were able to borrow, and more and more debt was federally subsidised. The result was that, all around the world, the marginal borrower found it much easier to raise finance. The consequences have been devastating for the international economy, and the story is told in gripping detail. No one has found the consequences more destabilising than the international property industry and its bankers. In Bricks and Mortals (Century Business, Pounds 25), Alastair Ross Goobey takes the reader on a tour of the property industry's booms and busts of the past 20 years. It is a compelling story, not least for its abundance of idiosyncratic and audacious personalities, whose failings are held largely responsible for the industry's current slump. Ross Goobey's account, though occasionally turgid, is accurate and thorough. His book, published in the summer, skates too quickly over the recent profusion of corporate collapses, but it is worth reading for its insight into the ambitious developments and deal-making of the second half of the 1980s. The recent spate of corporate failures that has resulted from the collapse in asset prices has left many shareholders concerned about the standards of information they receive from companies in which they have invested. Little wonder that Accounting for Growth (Century Business, Pounds 12.99), Terry Smith's useful, if incomplete, book on the potentially dry subject of accountancy, has attained great heights of publicity and sales: more than 60,000 copies to date. For the more seedy side of the late 1980s boom, try BCCI: the Inside Story of the World's Most Corrupt Financial Empire (Bloomsbury, Pounds 20). Written by Peter Truell and Larry Gurwin, it is the third and most comprehensive of the books on the bank since its collapse in 1990. It outlines in detail the Middle Eastern and US political connections to BCCI that made it far more than a bank and helps explain how it managed for so long to escape the scrutiny of financial regulators. A very different escape was staged by Nigel Lawson, the chancellor during the 'boom' part of Britain's latest and longest boom-bust cycle, who managed to jump ship with the rocks in sight. His memoirs, The View from No 11: Memoirs of a Tory Radical (Bantam Press, Pounds 20), provide a compelling and lucid explanation of events and personalities of the Thatcher era. The book does not pull its punches in its analysis of why the main protagonists parted company. In the process, it touches upon many economic issues that are still very much alive. But it contains much more - a wealth of material on City issues ranging from tackling fraud to bank behaviour and Lawson's own successful struggle with the BP underwriters after the 1987 Wall Street crash. Readers deterred by the book's 1,000-plus pages could heed the author's own suggestion in the foreword, and treat the contents as an a la carte meal. But at least there is only one volume. The New Palgrave Dictionary of Money and Finance (The Macmillan Press, Pounds 350) runs to three volumes, more than 2,500 pages and checks in at 14lb on the bathroom scales, making it the heavyweight business publication of the year. It is not an impulse buy. Built around more than 1,000 sizeable essays written by more than 800 authorities from around the world, it is a rich mine of information. It is readily accessed through a system of cross references which, if you have time on your hands, can send you off on lengthy and diverting by-ways through the text. Another weighty tome, physically at least, is Liberation Management: Necessary Disorganisation for the Nanosecond Nineties (Macmillan, Pounds 20; Knopf, Dollars 27.50) by Tom Peters, the millionaire American business evangelist. Do not be put off by its length - 834 pages - or Peters' penchant for wacky American slogans, such as 'marketising', 'fashionisation' and 'Glow] Tingle] Wow]' This is, in fact, the best management book of the year. Peters' enthusiasm for fast, flexible and customer-responsive companies lightens this packed guide to almost every advanced management practice under the sun: from delayering, delegation and empowerment to outsourcing, vertical disintegration and 'networks'. David Osborne and Ted Gaebler have produced a book of Peters-style prescriptions for the public sector. In Reinventing Government: How the Entrepreneurial Spirit is Transforming the Public Sector (Addison-Wesley, Pounds 19.95/Dollars 22.95), the authors argue that government must be more 'entrepreneurial' or businesslike if it is to overcome decades of accumulated bureaucratic inertia and financial waste. Their solutions include privatisation, decentralising responsibility to encourage innovation, and greater flexibility among civil servants. Improbably for such a dry subject, the book spent eight weeks on the New York Times non-fiction bestseller list and has been through several reprints since publication in February. Fans include Mr William Waldegrave, the cabinet minister in charge of reforming the UK's public sector, and President-elect Bill Clinton. Finally, some in-flight reading for the weary executive. While the New Palgrave Dictionary may be a little heavy for hand-luggage, a much more manageable alternative is Dave Barry Does Japan (Random House, Dollars 18), the story of US comedian Dave Barry's incursion into the inner sanctum of Japanese industry, the Keidanren. Dave Barry may be the funniest man writing in America today. His humour has a deliciously outlandish quality. He works out that, when a Japanese businessman tells a visiting foreigner 'we will study your proposal', he really means 'we will feed your proposal to a goat' - one useful tip that no management handbook or financial dictionary could reveal.

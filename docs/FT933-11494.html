			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Management (Marketing &amp; Advertising): When the jokes start to wear thin - Humour can benefit a campaign but must not make the product seem superfluous When Volkswagen introduced the Rabbit (known as the Golf in the UK) to the US market it used a simple commercial. It showed two rabbits looking straight at the camera. A voice-over stated: 'In 1956 there were only two VWs in America.' The ad lasted 10 seconds, but it made its case with economy and wit. There are good reasons for using humour in advertising. Both have compression forced on them: humour for effect, and commercials because air time costs money. Humour also helps commercial persuasion through its capacity to engage. Humour can soften the sales blow, relaxing viewers and making them more attentive. A good example was the recent 'Creature Comforts' campaign in which an animated panda, cat, tortoise and parrot took turns to vaunt the merits of electricity. The soundtrack amounted to little more than a straight product endorsement - something barely worthy of attention. But coming from comic Plasticine figures, the audience lapped it up. Such commercials show the value of using humour, not least as a defence against the devastating remote control which allows 'trigger-happy' viewers to wipe out thousands of pounds of advertising at the flick of a switch. The problem is that advertisers seem to have carried the joke too far. The evidence abounds. It starts with the over-representation of comic celebrities as brand mascots - from Robbie Coltrane (Persil washing up liquid) to Dudley Moore (Tesco) - not to mention the virtual colonisation by comedians of the financial services sector. The rationale behind this is that comedians are memorable and consumer-friendly. But their comic persona can overshadow the brand and any empathy felt towards them is no guarantee of action. It may be that British agencies are looking too hard for a joke on which to hang their selling proposition. One manifestation is the increasing number of spoof ads. For instance, the current Carling Black Label offering ('Spider in the dunny') looks very much like a Castlemaine XXXX commercial. This could be a measure of the confidence advertisers have in the capacity of viewers to distinguish between joke-kitsch and the real thing. But such ads have a fin de siecle feel to them. Though entertaining, they are self-indulgent. One-upmanship has edged out any strong product message. They imply that new creativity is impossible, that there can only be exhuming and recycling of the old. Advances in technology have also served as excuses for dragging humour into commercials. For example, a recent series of Tennent's Pilsner spots relied for their comic impact on a mixture of actions running forwards and backwards, including people jumping out of the sea. The impression it left was one of a technique looking for a script. Another culprit was the much-praised, but now defunct, Holsten campaign. As former JWT chairman, Jeremy Bullmore, pointed out: 'You could take Holsten out and you'd still get a quite agreeable technique of interfacing a modern comedian with old movie footage - which is admirable and difficult and clever - but more or less any product could have replaced it.' Or again, take the Mercury Communications ads starring Harry Enfield in something resembling an Ealing comedy. The suitability of a black-and-white pastiche for what is such a forward-looking IT company has to be questioned. Another instance of the joke getting the better of the product message? The humour in such commercials does not emerge from the product but is arbitrarily applied to it. It therefore fails to reveal anything of interest, importance or value about the product. Such ads may not bore, but neither are they likely to set the cash tills ringing. In replacing the hard sell with a more entertaining approach, often the product or service appears superfluous. As Bullmore sees it: 'Humour shouldn't be bolt-on, it should be integral. And once you've said that, you can get rid of about three-quarters of humorous advertising.' Winston Fletcher, chairman of Bozell Europe, the advertising agency, reiterates the point: 'Humour should support an idea, not be a substitute for one. It should make you think differently about what's being offered.' A good example is the current Direct Line motor insurance campaign, which sets the product in the role of hero. In it, a little red telephone comes hurtling to the rescue of people who need insurance. The phone not only symbolises the persona of the company, but encourages telephone inquiries. The campaign has been so successful that Direct Line has almost abandoned press advertising altogether. The golden rule for comedy in commercials is that the humour should arise from the selling point. Unless the humour is woven into the product message, the danger is the jokes will merely serve as a distraction. It should be impossible to remember the 'joke' without remembering the attendant message. Opting for a humorous style of advertising is fine provided it is not done at the expense of the selling principles on which advertising is founded. Advertising can be light hearted but it must not stop there. The ad has to make the viewer think differently about a product or service. Advertising must always be a means to an end. Therefore, the basic question for companies to ask themselves when presented with a humorous rough cut is: 'Would the ad still have shape if the product were removed?' Before accepting the humorous gloss agencies are wont to foist on them, companies must think carefully - otherwise they may find that the joke is on them.

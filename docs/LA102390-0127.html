			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SEAWALLS GET COUNCIL APPROVAL;  </P> <P> GUIDELINES: NEWPORT BEACH COMES UP WITH NEW RULES ON ENCROACHMENT BY BEACHFRONT  HOMEOWNERS INTO PUBLIC BEACH.  </P> <P> Ending one of the most contentious issues to erupt in this coastal city, the  City Council on Monday night voted unanimously to allow some beachfront  residents to keep seawalls, small patios and sun decks that extend onto the  public beach.  </P> <P> The new policy, hammered out after more than six public hearings over the span  of a year, will limit homeowners in the West Newport area to extensions of 15  feet beyond their property lines, while denying encroachments to homeowners on  Peninsula Point. Homeowners in a third area, the four blocks east of Balboa  Pier, will be allowed 7 1/2 feet of patio or fence encroachments.  </P> <P> The policy, which must be approved by the California Coastal Commission, also  establishes guidelines governing the use of the encroachment area and requires  homeowners to pay $600 a year in permit fees, or $300 if they live in the four  blocks east of Balboa Pier. Homeowners have a year to comply with the new  regulations.  </P> <P> "This is one of the toughest issues that the council could have to address,  because there is no one right answer," said Councilman John Cox. "The people  who care and care deeply have really studied this issue and have made their  recommendation."  </P> <P> The new policy is the result of more than a year of study by the city staff,  the Planning Commission and the Newport Beach Ocean Front Encroachment  Committee, a citizens' task force. In granting West Newport homeowners the  extensions, the council upheld the findings of the committee, which had  requested that 15-foot encroachments be allowed.  </P> <P> At Monday night's meeting, a representative of the Peninsula Point Homeowners  Assn. said that residents in his area would voluntarily remove their  encroachments in order to facilitate the new city policy.  </P> <P> The encroachments run along a 30-foot-wide easement that was dedicated by area  developers to the city for a beach road that was never been built. There are  just under 300 homes between the Santa Ana River channel and the tip of the  Balboa Peninsula that encroach onto the beach, some by as much as 27 feet.  </P> <P> For years, infringements onto the right of way were unchecked by city  officials, since there was no regulation governing the property extensions.  </P> <P> Monday night's meeting was attended by more than 125 people, many who came to  testify about the extension of a pedestrian-bike path along the beach to the  west and east of the current oceanfront sidewalk.  </P> <P> The California Coastal Commission, which must approve any land-use changes  along the beach, has said that any policy that allows encroachment should  include mitigation measures that will extend the pedestrian-bike path from 36th  Street to the Santa Ana jetty and from Balboa Pier to the Wedge.  </P> <P> Many residents speaking at Monday night's public hearing opposed the extension  of the walkway. "I really don't want to look at the concrete beach," said  Suzanne Warner, a resident of Seashore Drive.  </P> <P> The issue of beachfront encroachments was first brought to the attention of the  City Council nearly two years ago by the California Coastal Commission. The  council appointed a citizens' committee to come up with a policy, which was  then reviewed by the city Planning Commission. In August, planning  commissioners voted to allow a 10-foot encroachment and conduct an in-depth  study on ways to improve public access to the beach.  </P> <P> Among the arguments that the property owners and others have stated in favor of  maintaining some encroachment is that the landscaping, trees and decorative  walls improve the look of the beachfront. Others say that landscaping and walls  protect their homes from drifting sand, as well as from the public.  </P> <P> Opponents of the encroachment have maintained that the public right of way  should be protected. They also argue that the property owners should have to  pay for the use of the land, since it represents among the most valuable real  estate in the county.  </P></p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Arts: Major ballets resurrected - New productions of Ashton's 'Enigma Variations' and Massine's 'Le Tricorne' Birmingham Royal Ballet has begun its new season with the acquisition of two major works: Ashton's Enigma Variations and Massine's Le Tricorne. This is a welcome extension of Peter Wright's policy of rescuing important ballets from repertory oblivion. The recent staging of Choreartium was significant in reminding audiences of Massine's stature. There are other Massine works, ballets by Ashton, Tudor, MacMillan, Lichine  -and how many more - which merit such new life. The Tate Gallery aspect of such care - 20th century masterpieces kept on show for us - should be a vital aspect of BRB's identity. Not surprisingly, Enigma Variations came up very well at Tuesday night's first performance. The cast understood Ashton's loving homage to Elgar's world, with its nostalgic haze of golden autumnal light - such days as we are currently enjoying - warmed by late sun and much emotion. All honour to Michael Somes, great Ashtonian, who has mounted the ballet impeccably. It is also a tribute to the exceptional quality of BRB's artists as an ensemble of dance-actors. Technical style may be sometimes mousey; the playing of roles, as we see here, is authoritative. Enigma is, superficially, a series of vignette portraits done by a master - and assembled by a master into something far greater then its brief parts, with Ashton, like Elgar, able to evoke a social world and the feelings that sustain it with subtlest skill. With a couple of exceptions - Troyte like a man beset by hornets - the portraits are ideally done. I salute Desmond Kelly's life-like Elgar, true and commanding focus of the action, and the serene beauty of Sherilyn Kennedy's view of his wife. The work's emotional heart - the scenes with Alain Dubreuil's sincere, acutely judged Jaeger - was perfectly shown. Very touching, too, Sandra Madgwick as a mercurial Dorabella (coached, I'd venture, by Antoinette Sibley, the enchanting original) and Catherine Batcheller's noble Mary Lygon. The sense, throughout, is of a ballet honoured because understood. And I record with pleasure that Leslie Edwards is returned to the role of Nevinson which he created, and that his precision of playing is as rewarding as ever. About Tricorne my feelings are rather mixed. It is important that this masterpiece be seen, but it is increasingly difficult to find dancers who look as essentially Spanish and as stylish as Massine's dances demand, and as the Picasso designs and the de Falla score postulate. When the piece first came to the Royal repertory in 1947, Massine was on hand to galvanise the cast, and to show in his own performance the psychic and physical energies needed. (It was significant that the best interpreter of the Miller's Wife was the Bolshoi-trained Violetta Elvin, who brought a blaze of physical beauty and temperament to the dances.) On Tuesday, BRB's artists had still to come to terms with the piece: there was more sang-froid than hot blood on view. It is not a polite ballet, not in theme - sexual jealousy as comedy - nor in step, score or design. It must have the furia we see with Cumbre Flamenca, controlled but not diminished by balletic rule. BRB show it as some sort of Hispanic charade. Joseph Cipolla - who has the heart of the matter in him - came alive as the Miller when the dramatic temperature started to rise. Monica Zamora, very lovely, needs a dress, and emotions, of a deeper shade: let her trust her Spanish blood rather than her Baron's Court training. The neighbours look extinguished under the marvels of their costumes, vivid patterns and colours framing bun-faces and a general air of wishing they were in Frinton rather than Andalucia. (They should adopt a darker, bolder make-up, and the manner to go with it). But Tricorne is a masterpiece, worthy of every effort to capture its style. It must not be neglected, nor allowed to remain in its present deep-frozen state. It has been revived by Lorca Massine - and what has happened to the little kite that the Dandy used to fly? - its score, like the Elgar variations, played with strong theatrical sense by the Royal Ballet Sinfonia under Barry Wordsworth. The Tricorne production was sponsored by British Land. The programme was completed by David Bintley's Galanteries. Birmingham Royal Ballet plays this triple bill again on October 21, 22; then tours it to Edinburgh, Bradford, Bristol, Plymouth until November 26. Check local theatres for dates.</p>

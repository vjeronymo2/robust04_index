			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee market gets back to record-breaking ways Yesterday's opening surge in London coffee futures notched up another market record. At Dollars 924 for the September robusta futures contract, it was the biggest ever opening rise, according to Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst at brokers GNI. It easily beat the previous opening record of about Dollars 500. Just as significant as the market's extraordinary gain is the fact that the earlier record was reached in 1976, a year after the frost that decimated Brazil's coffee crop. The second severe freeze in a fortnight has increased the prospect of serious shortages for the next two years. That prospect has driven the market up 220 per cent this year, with a 77 per cent rise in the past two weeks alone. Traders in London said they could not remember two such severe frosts coming so close together before. Although they are only just beginning to get a clear picture of the damage from last month's frost, the initial fear yesterday was that as much as half Brazil's 1995-96 crop could now be in jeopardy. The Brazilian government had already cut its estimate for the crop to 17m bags from at least 25m before last Saturday's frost. The latest damage to coffee trees spread through the southern states of Parana and Sao Paolo but also again hit southern parts of the major producing state, Minas Gerais, where coffee production was moved during the 1980s to escape such freezes. One producer in a co-operative in the south of the state told the Reuters news agency: 'This was a very hard blow for us. It was worse than the frosts two weeks ago.' Particularly galling to farmers was that the latest frost - which left ice in some areas - damaged coffee fields that had been planted at 1,000 metres or above in order to avoid the frost danger. Ms Judy Ganes, softs analyst with Merrill Lynch in New York, said futures prices would go on rising because there was a danger that Brazil might run out of stocks if demand remained constant. Supply deficits looked set to continue from the 1993-94 season through to the 1995-96 season 'at a time when producers have already reduced their stockpiles of coffee'. The US Department of Agriculture puts the 1994-95 deficit at 9m bags, which will have to be met from producer stocks. Furthermore, the USDA is suggesting that only about 9m bags of the 17m-bag Brazilian government stockpile may be fit for consumption. 'If Brazil is going to sell 5m to 7.4m bags in the next 11 months, that's exhausting their stockpile,' said Ms Ganes. Brazil has suspended exports in order to assess the damage to the crop. Colombia yesterday announced it would halt registrations for private exporters, giving an added fillip to the New York market. There were mixed views about the likely impact of the price rise on production. While some Brazilian farmers may be scared off replanting in frost-damaged areas, other south American farmers may wish to cash in on the price bonanza by planting more. However, they will have to wait about three years before new plantings yield a crop.</p>

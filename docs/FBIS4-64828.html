			<p>BFN     [Text] The United Nations does not see prospects for  success in the efforts for implementation of the  confidence-building measures [CBMs], and for this reason it is  not willing to grant an extension to this process. Reliable UN  sources told CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation] that from  the contacts held after [UN Secretary General's special  representative on Cyprus] Joe Clark's departure from Cyprus  there was no evidence or developments that justify an extension  to the process. The same sources also noted that in view of  this situation, there is no plan to call a meeting in New York  between President Glavkos Kliridhis and Turkish Cypriot leader  Rauf Denktas.    Attention is now focused on the preparation and presentation  of the UN secretary general's report to the Security Council in  which the events will be reported objectively. Furthermore, the  same UN source rejected Denktas' accusations and the British  side's views that there were changes in the original package of  the confidence-building measures. The UN sources clarified that  the package of measures refers to the outline, whereas the 21  March document refers to the ways to implement the measures.  They also noted that the 21 March document includes serious  improvements which are almost all to the Turkish Cypriots'  benefit.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 11 (KNS-KCNA) -- The Central Standing  Committee of the General Association of Korean Residents in  Japan (Chongnyon) released a statement on March 11 denouncing  the criminal act of the South Korean authorities in dumping  nuclear waste in the East Sea of Korea at random.    The statement branded the nuclear waste dumping by the Kim  Yong-sam clique as the heaviest anti-national crime of turning  Korea into a barren land polluted with nuclear substances and  cutting off the lifeline of the nation and as a wanton violation  of international law and convention.    The statement further said:    The traitorous Kim Yong-sam group which, while developing  nuclear weapons under the "nuclear umbrella" of the United  States, had cried for "an international cooperation system" and  "a military countermeasure" and now, even at the working contact  for the exchange of special envoys between the two parts of  Korea, is reversing the black and white, raising a row over the  "nuclear issue". This is outrageous, indeed.    To make the matter worse, the traitor Kim Yong-sam plans to  visit Japan a few days later and have a confab for a more  vicious smear campaign against the DPRK and Chongnyon. This  will be a criminal mendicant trip designed to balk the  projected third round of DPRK-U.S. talks at any cost in  conspiracy with outside forces and continue to do harm to the  DPRK.    The Kim Yong-sam clique has been hell bent on flunkeyist  treachery, fascism, confrontation with the North and splittist  moves and, as if it were not enough, is now unhesitatingly  dumping radioactive waste. This is a criminal act which can be  committed only by them who are clean indifferent to the nation  and international law.    The South Korean rulers must stop the criminal nuclear waste  dumping at once, disclose its truth and apologize to the whole  nation.    We strongly demand that the Kim Yong-sam regime immediately  give up the anti-reunification and anti-national moves to kill  fellow countrymen in reliance upon outside forces, scrap the  "National Security Law" and unconditionally stop the fascist  suppression of the South Korean people.</p>

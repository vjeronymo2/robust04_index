			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Brandenburg faces early poll The east German state of Brandenburg yesterday looked set to call an early election in June after its governing coalition broke up in dispute over state premier Manfred Stolpe's role during the communist era. The state legislature called a special session for April 13 to vote on putting forward the election, originally planned for September but now likely on June 12, the same day as the European parliament elections. Brandenburg is the fourth of the five eastern German states to see its government stumble since German unification in 1990.</p>

			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Books: The struggle for the soul of the sixties - Poetry INDIAN JOURNALS by Allen Ginsberg Penguin Pounds 6.99, 210 pages POMES ALL SIZES by Jack Kerouac City Lights Books Pounds 6.95, 175 pages MINDFIELD by Gregory Corso Paladin Pounds 6.99, 268 pages THERE he goes, in a high ganja reverie, slipping in and out of the alleyways of Benares in dhoti and lumberjack shirt, bespectacled and already balding in his mid-30s, though he sports a big, holy man's beard. On the wall of the dirty little hovel he shares with Peter Orlovsky, his poet-lover, hangs the death mask of William Blake, prophet, seer, mentor to the Beat Generation. Allen Ginsberg is dreaming of the spiritual rebirth of America. The date? 1962. The re-publication of Ginsberg's Indian Journals of 1962-63 in their original form - complete with illustrations, and his own idiosyncratic approach to grammar, spelling and other dubious orthodoxies - is only one of a number of new and forthcoming titles from members of the Beat Generation. Earlier this year, Viking America published a Beat Reader; next spring we are promised the Kerouac/Ginsberg Correspondence from the same publisher. For the moment we have, in addition to the Ginsberg journals, the selected poems of Gregory Corso and, perhaps most interesting of all, a hitherto unpublished collection of poetry from Jack Kerouac. The Indian Journals, which consist of dream sequences, sketches, poems, night reveries, political ravings, accounts of visits to opium dens, many ganja-induced, crazed scramblings of past and present, and a number of absorbing reflections upon the state of American poetry at the turn of the 1960s, possess an intellectual coherence and a vein of self-mockery that one would not have associated with Ginsberg, that assiduous tinkler of the cow-bell. What they make clear to us above all perhaps, and setting all the absurdities aside, is that the Beats genuinely regarded the East and its philosophies as the best means of combating the wilfully corrosive, hell-bent materialism of the West: their mission was nothing less than a serious crusade to save America's soul from damnation. Jack Kerouac's collection of 'new' poems has been a long time coming. Written between 1954 and 1965, and taking in drafts of poems written in Berkeley, Mexico, Tangier and the Bowery, it has been lying in Lawrence Ferlinghetti's safe in San Francisco since Kerouac died in 1969. It was not until 1988 that Ferlinghetti, in the course of an uneasy meeting with Kerouac's widow at the dedication of the Kerouac Memorial Park in Lowell, Massachusetts, aired the subject of the estate's releasing it for publication. There had been hostility between the surviving members of the Beat Generation and Kerouac's family, who held the Beats responsible for driving Kerouac into the addiction to drugs and booze that killed him. Now Ferlinghetti has got his wish - a cheap paperback edition of Pomes All Sizes, complete with his own portrait of Kerouac on the jacket. The collection is rough, raw, uneven - and perpetually fascinating. There are mystical, Buddha-friendly pomes; damp, sad, street pomes; pomes written in the Quebecois French that Kerouac learnt at his mother's knee; streams of haiku (that form so beloved of the Beats); slivers of pomes of all shapes and sizes. Scarcely a single one of them has been worked up into a state of formal perfection - though such a notion would have been meaningless to the Beats anyway, who worshipped above all things the God of spontaneity. Corso's selected poems, Mindfield, are less engaging for a number of reasons. Four years younger than Ginsberg, he clearly regarded himself as a soaring, playful, mythical creature who could banter with words as if they were a child's hoop and, in the course of pleasing himself by doing so, delight us all. Ginsberg over-praises him to the skies in one of several introductions to the book - but we know that this is simply one more instance of speaking well of one's friends. Exclamation marks proliferate throughout Corso's work because life is essentially Wondrous. Much of the poetry is written in a state of manic delirium - evidence of a pure spirit throwing off its shackles. Unfortunately, Corso has the ability to see off big themes - themes that other, lesser poets, Shakespeare, for example, have shed a lifetime's blood and craft over - with bravura gestures of a breathtaking platitudinousness: 'Death proved meaningless without Life. While Ginsberg and Kerouac may have been wedded to the theory of the importance of spontaneous effusion (or 'un-repressed word slinging' in Kerouac's own words) as the most effective means of blasting the false consciousness of America, they manage, at their best, to see reality sharply and clearly. Consider Ginsberg's harrowing descriptions of the burning-ghats of Calcutta in Indian Journals, how the ghee streams down the cheeks of the decomposing faces of the dead. . . Though the Beats may have come walking down the mountain in stride with Whitman and Blake, the scene was not necessarily shrouded in mist. Not all of the time anyway.</p>

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Unita suspends truce talks The Angolan rebel Unita movement yesterday suspended its participation in ceasefire talks with the Angolan government in the Zambian capital, Lusaka. 'We suspended our participation in the meeting late this morning because. . . the truce has been violated,' Unita chief negotiator and secretary-general Eugenio Manuvakola told reporters. Asked if the formal signing of a peace accord to end the 19-year Angolan civil war could go ahead as planned in Lusaka on Sunday, he replied: 'Let us wait and see.' Unita earlier accused the government of violations of a truce which should have come into force on Wednesday to smooth the way for Sunday's signing by Unita leader Jonas Savimbi and Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. Mr Manuvakola said government troops had overrun the northern Angolan city of Uige yesterday morning.</p>

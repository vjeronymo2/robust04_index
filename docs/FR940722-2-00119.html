Amtrak is requesting that it be permitted to extend the clean, oil, test and stencil (COT&amp;S) period from 36 months to 48 months on all passenger cars equipped with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 26&hyph;C Brake Equipment. Section 232.17(b)(2) states_``Brake equipment on passenger cars must be clean, repaired, lubricated and tested as often as necessary to maintain it in a safe and suitable condition for service but not less frequently than as required in Standard S&hyph;045 in the Manual of Standards and Recommended Practices of the Association of American Railroads (AAR).'' Paragraph 2.1.2 of Standard S&hyph;045 (AAR Manual Section A, Part III) currently specifies 36 months for 26&hyph;C Type Brake Equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FRA Docket Number H&hyph;91&hyph;2 authorized Amtrak to conduct a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> four year test of the 26&hyph;C Brake Equipment on 50 cars of their 103 Horizon car fleet built between May 1989 and January 1990. A tear down inspection of five representative cars was conducted after the four year service period. The test has now been concluded and a final report indicating satisfactory performance of the brake equipment over the four year test period has been issued. As a result of this performance, Amtrak has requested that the COT&amp;S period for all cars with 26&hyph;C Brake Equipment be extended to 48 months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written reviews, data or comments.

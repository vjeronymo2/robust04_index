			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Government in Nigeria accused of repression Amnesty International yesterday accused the Nigerian government of jailing hundreds and killing dozens of opponents to stifle political activity, write Paul Adams in Lagos and Reuter. The human rights pressure group said it considered Chief Moshood Abiola, winner of the 1993 presidential elections but imprisoned by the military government, as a prisoner of conscience. 'The country is now facing one of the most serious human rights crises for decades, triggered by these killings of critics, imprisonment for treason of the president-elect of Nigeria and the detentions of ethnic group leaders, prominent trade unionists and opposition politicians,' it said. Amnesty called on the Nigerian government to release all prisoners of conscience and abolish legislation allowing indefinite detention without charge or trial. It accused the government of arresting hundreds of demonstrators, detaining government critics and using 'lethal force' to crush pro-democracy protests and strikes. 'The military government of General Sani Abacha has shown its contempt for the rule of law and internationally recognised human rights by silencing the opposition not only in the press and the streets, but also in the courts,' it said. Amnesty also accused the government of repressing the impoverished Ogoni people of southeast Nigeria who have protested against pollution by oil companies. Meanwhile, Nigeria's constitutional conference has been extended by at least two months until next January. Delegates at the conference in Abuja will review proposed changes to the constitution until December 8, then begin to approve a draft constitution on January 9. The conference was set up by Gen Sani Abacha's military regime, which seized power after the annulment of last year's presidential election, to pave the way for the promised transfer to elected civilian rule.</p>

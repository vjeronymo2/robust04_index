			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Abacha seeks to bolster hard line with shake-up: Political moderate replaced as new chiefs are named for Nigeria's army and navy Nigeria's head of state, Gen Sani Abacha, has restructured the military high command following his crackdown on civilian opposition last week that widened the ethnic divide between the north and south-west of the country and exposed divisions within the armed forces. The government announced new chiefs of the army and navy on Monday in an effort to bolster Gen Abacha's hard line against jailed opposition leader Mr Moshood Abiola and banned leaders of the striking oil workers' unions. The union leaders yesterday were reinstated until Aug-ust 31 by a federal high court judge who said he would hear an appeal against their dismissal on that date. There are indications that the military changes may be followed shortly by a reshuffle in the civilian cabinet. Maj Gen Mohammed Chris Alli, a Christian from the Middle Belt of Nigeria and reputed to be a political moderate, has been replaced by Brig Gen Alwali Kazir, formerly commander of a northern army division. Rear Admiral Allision Madueke, an Ibo who fought for the rebel Biafrans in the 1967 civil war, is succeeded as head of the navy by Commodore Mike Akhigbe, a former military governor of Lagos state. There is strong speculation Gen Abacha will replace Lt Gen Oladipo Diya as chief of general staff. Along with one third of the armed forces, Gen Diya like Mr Abiola is a member of the southern Yoruba tribe and was expected to press hard for the regime to accommodate the different interest groups in Nigeria and move quickly towards democratic rule. His position as number two has been circumvented by Mr Aminu Saleh, secretary to the government, who is seen as an advocate of political domination by the north. After 24 years of army rule, the Nigerian armed forces' main role is political rather than military and although most troops and technically skilled personnel are drawn from from the south and the Middle Belt, a minority of northern officers remain a dominant influence in the army and in the key intelligence services. The government has taken a tough political stand against the economically powerful south-west: Lagos is the main port, the centre of banking and commerce and the base for more than half of manufacturing industry. The army has a nominal strength of 62,000. There are four army divisions in the west, east and north of Nigeria which are at operational strength, and a battalion of presidential guards in Abuja. Military analysts say that most other units are under-strength, under-equipped and under-trained. Morale is low and repeated late pay has been partly alleviated by the military's lucrative share in fuel distribution since the oil workers' six-week strike left most filling stations dry. The hardened stance by the Abacha government appears to rule out any dialogue or compromise with Mr Abiola and those who support his claim to form a civilian government. In a speech last week, the head of state said would not drop the charges of treason against Mr Abiola, who faces trial again in Abuja on August 29. Maj Gen Alli and Rear Admiral Madueke were key members of the military junta which helped Gen Abacha to oust interim civilian president Ernest Shonekan last November and force out of power the remnants of ex-president Ibrahim Babangida's closest allies remaining in the armed forces. After the annulment of Mr Abiola's victory in last June's presidential poll, then president Babangida appointed Gen Alli as head of a committee of inquiry into the issue. The committee reported that the best way out of the political impasse was to declare and uphold the results of the June elections. This view had widespread support among the armed forces, most whom voted for Mr Abiola, the Yoruba candidate from the south-west, even in the presidential brigade of guards in Abuja, according to military sources. As Gen Abacha acknowledged, there is still a ground-swell of support for democracy in the armed forces.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Tsekhmistrenko: "Russian-Greek Economic </F> Relations: The Path From the Varangians to the Greeks Passes  Through a Business Club"]    [Text]  <H5>  Russian-Greek Trade Volume (Based on Information From the </H5> Greek Embassy in Russia)    Greek exports to Russia: $125 million in 1992 and $175  million in 1993 (an increase of 40 percent). The export  structure is dominated by agricultural products, refined  petroleum products, bauxite and other ores, and consumer goods.    Russian exports to Greece: $437 million in 1992 and $479  million in 1993 (an increase of 9.6 percent). The export  structure is dominated by oil, non-ferrous metals and motor  vehicles.    Russia's share of Greek exports was 1.3 percent in 1993, and  1.9 percent of its imports.    There are already 70 large and 150 medium-sized and small  Greek firms in Moscow. Their numbers are growing. A total of 20  Russian-Greek joint ventures have been established in Greece  (primarily in Piraeus).    * * *    At the end of next week Brussels will witness the final and  decisive round of Russia's talks with the European Union  regarding partnership and cooperation. In connection with this  Moscow attaches particular importance to the position taken by  Athens, current chairman of the Union. But there appears to be  no reason for concern: Greece has already announced its  intention to facilitate the signing of an agreement without  delay. Furthermore, Athens has decided to set an example and  demonstrate that mutually advantageous cooperation with Russia  is quite possible. Toward that end a business club has been  established at the Greek Embassy in Moscow, with its official  opening held yesterday.    The Greeks make no secret of the fact that the signing of a  cooperation agreement between the European Union and Russia  would be a worthy prize for Greece's six-month chairmanship of  the Union. And Greece's new ambassador to Moscow, Kiryakos  Rodusakis, has from the very first days following his arrival a  few months ago devoted particular attention to the establishment  of contacts between business people in the two countries. He  proposed establishing a business club in order to help his  countrymen who are willing to take the risk of plunging into the  tumultuous Russian market. That initiative garnered the support  of approximately 20 Greek companies that have been operating in  Russia for several years and have offices in Moscow. The time  lag between words and actions proved short, and last Thursday  the Greek Embassy was the scene of an official presentation of  the business club (with the club temporarily headquartered in  the embassy's commercial section). It was there that Mr.  Rodusakis announced his intention to get Russian entrepreneurs  who have or would like to have business ties with Greece  involved in the club as well.    According to the Greek ambassador, the business club's  primary function is to fill the information vacuum that has thus  far hampered expansion of economic relations between the two  countries. Toward that end the decision was made to establish  close cooperation both with the Russian authorities and with  commercial structures. In addition, the club intends to provide  information about prospects for business in various sectors of  the economy. Priority will be given to those sectors in which  the Greeks have considerable experience and strong traditions:  trade, shipping, tourism, banking, insurance, construction,  communications and the food industry. The club will place  particular emphasis on familiarizing Greek businessmen with  regions both in Russia (Siberia and the Volga region) and in the  rest of the CIS (the Crimea, the Caucasus, Kazakhstan and  Uzbekistan) where the Greek diaspora is represented.    For this summer the club has plans to sponsor the first  international Greco-Russian congress on cooperation in Moscow,  and also to open a joint business center in Russia's capital.</p>

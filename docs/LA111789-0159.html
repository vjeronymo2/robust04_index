			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 GROUPS JOIN TO END WATER WARS IN STATE  </P> <P> Two committees formed to study water policy issues -- one in the San Francisco  Bay Area and one in Southern California -- said Thursday that they have joined  forces to seek an end to California's water wars.  </P> <P> The groups are the Southern California Water Committee, chaired by Ventura  County Supervisor John Flynn, and the Bay Area's Committee for Water Policy  Consensus, headed by Contra Costa County Supervisor Sunne McPeak.  </P> <P> Flynn and McPeak said the new State Water Conservation Coalition includes local  governments, business interests and environmentalists. They told the state  Water Resources Control Board that the new group will work for a statewide  consensus on the volatile issue of water quality in the San Francisco-San  Joaquin River Delta.  </P> <P> Water drawn from the delta currently is used by San Joaquin Valley farmers and  the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which imports Northern  California water for use by urban Southern California.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Today, on the first Friday of the auspicious  month of Ramadan, millions of fasting compatriots held Friday  prayers in the cities and various areas of the country in an  atmosphere imbued with spirituality.    The unifying and formidable Friday prayers were held in  Tehran under the imamate of His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i,  the exalted leader of the Islamic revolution, and Tehran's  Friday imam, and with a spectacular participation of the fasting  and faithful people in serried ranks at Tehran University and  its surrounding streets.    His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i devoted the first prayer  sermon to a discussion about the importance of observing divine  piety and its role in a life of faithful human beings and, while  calling upon the worshippers to take the opportunity of the  blessed month of Ramadan for entering the tremendous realm of  piety, said: Piety brings many benefits with it to the life of  human beings, including the guarding of self against slips and  precipices. Strengthening a spirit of piety brings success for  human beings in divine tests and enables them to continue along  the path of further strengthening their faith and serving God.    Tehran's Friday imam considered the fall of eastern  imperialism to have resulted from lack of piety and said: Fall  comes after lack of piety and nations devoid of piety will be  beset by pride, arrogance, deviation, and destruction. The fact  that the powerful nations of the world have been beset by all  that at various periods of history demonstrates that all the  impious individuals and nations of the world must await such a  fall. [passage omitted]    The Friday prayer leader of Tehran stressed the widespread  currency of words of righteousness in the Islamic country of  Iran. He said: The present aura in the country belongs to  righteousness. This is because our sovereignty is based on  righteousness to which our nation ardently adhere. For this  reason, we are not sensitive to the nonsense spoken by the  wrong-doers. In the Islamic system, security has been provided  for all the members of the society, even for those who are not  in agreement with the trend of righteousness. [passage omitted]    His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i began the second sermon of  the Friday prayers by paying tribute to the Iranian nation for  their epic making presence in the 11 February revolution  anniversary demonstrations, and considered this move of the  people as an important and effective blow to the poisonous  propaganda of the enemies of the Islamic Republic of Iran.    [Begin Khamene'i recording] I consider it necessary to  sincerely thank the great, aware, and vigilant nation of Iran--a  nation who appreciates time and place, is fully capable of  identifying its enemies, and is always grateful to God for His  blessings--for displaying its power and might on 11 February  before the eyes of the friends of foes the world over.    The huge streets of Tehran, the Azadi Square, and all towns  and cities were filled with a massive crowd on that day. This  was the case even in those towns which the enemy wants to  portray as having disputes with the Islamic system. The serious  and resolute faces of the people of these towns were clearly  visible. The enemies and the others [as heard] saw that the  Iranian nation conducted its movement in such a cohesive manner.  [end recording]    The leader of Islamic revolution continued his sermons by  referring to the hefty budget that the Zionist and arrogant  media devote to their attempts to influence the public opinion  of the Iranian nation. He said: News agencies which are  influenced and guided by the Zionists, as well as a number of  foreign radio stations have been trying for a while now to  create the illusion that the Iranian people are no longer  interested in the revolution and Islam, and the performance of  the Islamic republic has led to the weakening of Islam.  However, this deceitful ploy is too disgraceful for any one to  pay attention to. This is because Islam's growth and  magnificence in the world is due to the creation of the Islamic  republic.    The Friday prayer leader of Tehran then revealed the  propaganda ploys of the enemies of Islam and said: They want to  induce that the formation of an Islamic government and the  delivery of the crushing blow of Islam and the Koran to the  enemies has caused Islam harm. However, they are ignorant about  Islam. If what the enemies claim had been correct, then the  eminent prophet of Islam would not have formed a political  entity, and he would not have been involved so many wars.  Furthermore, His Holiness 'Ali, may peace be upon him, would  not have set out to form a government, and the leaders of the  Islamic community during the early years of Islam would have  remained in their homes.    His eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i said that the people's  magnificent rallies on 11 February humiliated the enemies of  Islam. He said: Our enemies saw that the Iranian nation was  present on the scene cohesively. Today one cannot find any  other nation in the world which is able to mobilize its people  in this way to take part in a national and ideological event.  [passage omitted]    His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i said the issue of occupied  Palestine is another example of the onslaught by the enemies of  Islam. He said: The usurper Israelis have usurped Palestine in  full view of the world people and continue to torture, exile,  bomb, and execute Palestinians; but the arrogant world, headed  by America, condemns the oppressed Palestinians and criticizes  their defense of their home. That shows what sort of malevolent  new order is ruling the world.    The leader of the Islamic revolution referred to the world  powers collaborating to destroy Islam. He said: The enemies of  Islam have started a dangerous and harsh struggle against Islam.  The longer it takes the more they fail, and governments  supporting them more scarce. World Muslims should know that  Islamic Iran is the point where Islam can say its piece with  strength.  [passage omitted]</p>

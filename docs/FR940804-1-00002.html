Producers who participate in the Feed Grain Acreage Reduction Program (ARP) would be eligible for benefits such as price support loans and deficiency payments. This action is required by section 105B of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended (the 1949 Act).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before September 14, 1994, in order to be assured of consideration.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be mailed to Director, Grains Analysis Division, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), P.O.

Based on information compiled by the USDA, this proposed rule has been determined to be ``economically significant'' because it would have an annual effect on the economy of more than $100 million and would materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, or loan programs or rights and obligations of recipients thereof. Budget outlays for deficiency payments are expected to range from $1.5 to $3.5 billion annually. This proposed rule would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities; would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; and would not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles set forth in Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is applicable to this proposed rule since the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) is required by section 105B(o) of the 1949 Act to request comments with respect to the subject matter of this rule. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was prepared, which determined that this regulation will have no significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because the particular acreage reduction percentages considered will not affect the paperwork, reporting, or compliance burdens of the small entities in the program. CCC thus certifies that the rule will have no significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis describing the options considered in developing this proposed rule and the impact of the implementation of each option is available on request from the above-named individual.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It has been determined by an environmental evaluation that this action will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment.

A PLD program is not being considered because, given the allowed ARP percentages, it is not needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If an ARP is announced, the reduction shall be achieved by applying a uniform percentage reduction to the respective feed grain acreage base for the farm. In making such a determination, the number of acres placed into the agricultural resources conservation program established under subtitle D of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, must be taken into consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Producers who knowingly produce feed grains in excess of the respective permitted acreage for the farm plus any respective feed grain acreage planted in accordance with the flexibility provisions are ineligible for loans and purchases and all payments with respect to that crop on the farm. If an ARP program for the 1995 crop is in effect, the program must be announced no later than September 30, 1994. Adjustments in the announced program may be made if it is determined that there has been a significant change in the total supply of feed grains since the program was first announced. These adjustments must be made no later than November 15, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 105B of the 1949 Act, not less than 60 days before the program is announced for a crop of feed grains, proposals for public comment on various program options for the crop of feed grains are required to be set forth. Each option must be accompanied by an analysis that includes the estimated planted acreage, production, domestic and export use, ending stocks, season average producer price, program participation rate, and cost to the Federal Government that would likely result from each option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In determining the 1995 corn ARP, the Secretary will choose a specific ARP reduction percentage from within a range established by the estimated ending  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stocks-to-use (S/U) ratio for the 1994/95 corn marketing year.

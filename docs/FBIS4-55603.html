			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Agata Nowakowska: "The Constitution According to </F> the SLD--Weakening the President"]    [Text] What will the president be doing if the  Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] manages to push through its  constitutional draft? He will be awarding medals and shaking  diplomats' hands.    In April of 1993 (in the previous Sejm), the SLD submitted  its own constitutional draft. Since then, Lech Walesa  successfully made life miserable for the SLD several times  already.    As soon as Walesa signed the Budget Law, a group of Sejm  deputies for the SLD made an attempt to amend the Small  Constitution. They wanted to severely limit presidential powers,  but the Belweder reacted in strong terms: The president even  made a declaration that he "will dissolve the Sejm" even if he  is "subsequently charged by the Tribunal of State."    In the end, however, a cease-fire came into force:  Aleksander Kwasniewski promised that the SLD will not tinker  with the Small Constitution, and Walesa promised to accept the  SLD's new candidate for finance minister, as well as allow  deputy ministers coming from the SLD into the Ministries of  Defense, Internal Affairs, and Foreign Affairs.  <H5>  Corrections After a Lesson </H5>   But, after this lesson, the SLD changed its previous draft  of  the "big" constitution. It blows a strike, first of all, to the  president, whoever he happens to be (presidential elections are  scheduled for fall 1995).    The SLD draft suggests cutting short the president's term of  office from six years (the old version) to five years. Instead,  the Sejm's term would be expanded: It would last until the  first session of a new Sejm. The SLD wants to avoid a case  similar to that of Hanna Suchocka, who was in power without the  Sejm's supervision.    The point is also to make it impossible for a future  president to block governmental nominations (as happened in the  case of Dariusz Rosati, the SLD's initial candidate for the post  of finance minister), to drag his feet over signing the budget,  or to try to avoid accepting individuals from the governing  party or coalition into the presidential ministries.  <H5>  Almighty Prime Minister </H5>   The SLD now wants the Sejm to appoint a prime minister, with  the president having a say only after four unsuccessful attempts  by the Sejm (he could also order early elections in such cases.)  Under the previous draft, it was the president who made a  motion in the Sejm to have a candidate approved.    The SLD also changed its mind concerning ministers: They are  to be appointed not by the president but by the prime minister  (under the old version, the president was to perform the role of  a notary public; he would sign a nomination at the request of  the government's chief). The president would lose the privilege  of appointing the attorney general. According to the SLD's new  draft, this would be done by the Sejm, which would also appoint  a chancellor of the law, who would supervise the conformity of  draft laws with the legal system.  <H5>  A Lesson Over Budget </H5>   The Polish Peasant Party and the SLD were scared until the  very last moment that Walesa might not sign this year's budget.  The SLD wants to avoid such traumas in the future: Under the  proposals, the president would have to either sign the budget or  veto it within seven days. However, the Sejm could overrule  such a veto by a three-fifths' majority, thus forcing the  president to sign the budget anyway.    Under the previous draft, the SLD treated the budget almost  the same way as other types of laws: The president could sign  or veto the budget within 15 days; he could also address an  inquiry to the Constitutional Tribunal over the budget's  conformity with the Constitution.  <H5>  Concordat, Work, Personality </H5>   The SLD has been saying for a long time that the Concordat  with the Vatican is discriminatory vis-a-vis non-Catholic  churches. In the new constitutional draft, the party makes  things perfectly clear: Nobody can be placed at an advantage by  any kind of law or international agreement.    The SLD declares a regime of a "social market economy" (even  though the statute of Social Democracy of the Polish People's  Republic speaks of democratic socialism), it wants to provide  legislative guarantees for a 40-hour workweek (which the  striking miners demanded recently), and it guarantees a right to  organize strikes, but it also leaves a safety valve in the form  of the possibility of banning strikes, for instance, in  strategic sectors of the economy.    The SLD declares in its draft that work is "the fundamental  precondition for the development of the human personality," and  it wants to give every citizen the right to "unrestricted  development of his or her personality" and to "freely chosen  work done for just remuneration."    The SLD promises free education in public schools, free  health service at public clinics and hospitals (but only such  services as are "necessary for health protection"), and the  right to a dwelling.</p>

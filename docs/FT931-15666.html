			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Court plea on pit pay fails MINERS FROM two of the 10 collieries that are closing under the government's pit closure programme lost a court action yesterday to win bonuses on top of basic pay, Richard Donkin writes. The case was brought by the Union of Democratic Mineworkers on behalf of miners at Silverhill and Cotgrave pits in Nottinghamshire, where coal production has stopped. The union argued that miners at the two pits, and at eight other collieries facing closure, should be given bonus payments and shift allowances as well as basic pay for the period they have been laid off. The union believed that, had the court action been successful, miners at all 10 pits could have claimed up to Pounds 2,000 in back pay from the time production stopped last year. The payments would not have affected redundancy terms because British Coal has agreed to base calculations on the period up to the closure announcements in October, when men would have been receiving bonuses. Mr David Prendergast, UDM vice-president, said the union was disappointed by the decision 'and we are considering grounds for appeal'.</p>

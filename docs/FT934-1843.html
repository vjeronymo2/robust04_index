			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Six new highs registered around the Pacific Basin Continuing political turmoil on the final day of the special parliamentary session kept many investors away from the market, but the Nikkei average closed higher on index-linked buying, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index rose 180.42 to 17,489.15. The Topix index of all first section stocks edged up 1.34 to 1,452.35. Share prices fluctuated on index-linked trading by arbitrageurs. Weakness on the Chicago futures market overnight dragged the Nikkei down to a low of 17,169.52 during the first 15 minutes of trading. Index-linked buying in the afternoon pushed the index to a high of 17,536.15 just before the close. Volume totalled 210m shares, against 221m. Declines led rises by 522 to 464, with 175 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 11.52 at 1,207.18. Investors were cautious as negotiations between the coalition government and the opposition parties over the extension of the parliamentary session dragged on. Although the Liberal Democratic Party, the leading opposition party, is expected to compromise eventually, its threat to boycott talks if the parliamentary session were extended heightened public anxiety. Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities said that in spite of the political uncertainty, investors were banking on Mr Hosokawa's pledge last week to implement measures to help the economy, and his show of concern over a weak stock market. High-technology issues were strong, led by Sony, which rose Y120 to Y5,430. Hitachi moved ahead Y20 to Y835 and Toshiba Y18 to Y702. Sumitomo Metal Mining, which climbed Y47 to Y847, saw continued popularity on a rally in the gold market. However, banks lost ground on profit-taking. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y40 to Y2,850 and Fuji Bank Y20 to Y1,890. Brokers were also weak, with Daiwa Securities down Y40 to Y1,220. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 23.93 to 19,225.17 in volume of 36.8m shares. High-technology issues were higher, with Nintendo, the video game maker, up Y50 at Y7,150. Roundup The region scored another six new highs. A potential seventh, Bombay, was officially open but brokers refused to trade for the second consecutive day to protest against a ban on carry forward deals. BANGKOK, where there were worries about overheating in financials, still managed a 2.4 per cent advance, the SET index finishing 36.07 higher at a new peak of 1,519.06. Turnover amounted to Bt32.03bn, second only to the record Bt36.27bn set on November 3 this year. TAIWAN's financial sector soared and offset heavy profit-taking elsewhere, the weighted index hitting a 22-month high of 5,161.80, up 58.84. Turnover swelled to TDollars 129.65bn, the heaviest since June 1990. The Big Three commercial banks all closed limit up, while Cathay Life Insurance surged TDollars 8 to TDollars 194. SINGAPORE saw strong domestic retail buying due to low interest rates, which pushed the Straits Times Industrial index ahead by 18.93 to a new peak of 2,271.24 in volume of 555.7m shares. KUALA LUMPUR set its high on buying of index-linked stocks, the KLSE composite index adding 23.43 at 1,116.09. Analysts said that expectations of a successful conclusion to world trade talks also boosted sentiment. JAKARTA, a recent critical choice for 1994, peaked again with the official index 7.76 stronger at 543.84 on both foreign and domestic buying. HM Sampoerna extended a strong performance, rising Rp700 to Rp12,000 on an upward earnings revision. SEOUL fell just short of its year's high as the composite index climbed 8.66 points to 865.86 on follow-through buying in blue chip manufacturing stocks and shares with low price/earnings ratios. HONG KONG reflected profit-taking by institutions, the Hang Seng index shedding 76.22 to end a volatile day at 9,945.26. AUSTRALIA fell on Wall Street's weakness overnight and on declining metal prices, the All Ordinaries index closing 16.7 lower at 2,069.9.</p>

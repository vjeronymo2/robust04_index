REUTERS quoted Akashi  as saying he had tried to mediate and effect a total and  immediate ceasefire, but that vast differences existed between  the conditions made by the two confronted sides. He regretted  that no agreement had resulted at this time, but refused to  attribute responsibility to either side.    The Japanese diplomat added that the biggest obstacle to an  agreement was the Moslems' insistence that the Serbs withdraw  their artillery from positions around Sarajevo and place it  under U.N. control. Akashi and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan  Karadzic had drafted a truce agreement at their meeting earlier  in the day. The truce, subject to Moslem approval on Sunday  evening, was to take effect at 10 A.M. local time (09:00 G.M.T.)  on Monday, February 7.</p>

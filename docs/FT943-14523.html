			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Accountancy Column: Partners contemplate a new existence - Why liability and more positive factors are making incorporation an attractive option Just one month after he took over from Mr Jim Butler as head of KPMG Peat Marwick at the start of this year, Mr Colin Sharman called a meeting of the firm's inner sanctum of 25 'general partners' to discuss a radical proposal for change. He put forward a suggestion that has stirred the profession in the last two weeks, since the news emerged that KPMG, the UK's second largest firm, was considering abandoning its traditional legal status as a partnership in favour of incorporation. When details of the plan emerged, much of the rhetoric focused on incorporation as a technique to limit the liability of partners from vexatious legal actions. In practice, the issue is far more wide-ranging. For professional partnerships as a whole, the motives are varied and the results mixed. At a country hotel in Berkshire at the start of this month, the KPMG general partners met again and agreed to set up a small sub-committee of three, including Mr Sharman, to take the idea further. They have until late September to report back, before making proposals to the full partnership at its annual meeting in October. The sub-committee faces some formidable challenges. One of the frustrations is that little is known about incorporation in professional firms. Few of any size have so far done it, and little research exists on how successful it has been. KPMG is not alone in considering the issue. For example, Mr Ian Brindle, senior partner of Price Waterhouse, says: 'It is more a case of when than whether'. He says the firm is examining incorporation, but is unlikely to make a decision even within the next 12 months. Like KPMG, Brindle argues that the escalating lawsuits against accountants is a key force for change. 'The driver is the liability situation,' he says. 'It's got so out of hand.' The same view is taken in a fact sheet issued to its members last October by the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants. By incorporating, a firm gets around the difficulty that all the personal assets of all of its partners are at stake. The firm itself can still be sued as a corporate entity, but most of the partners would have their own wealth protected. Those still at personal risk would be the ones directly involved in the advice which led to the legal action being taken, who could still be sued individually. They, like the firm, would attempt to buy insurance cover for their protection. 'What it gets around is the problem of the Aberdeen tax partner suffering because of a muck-up by an audit partner in the south east of England,' says Sharman. Incorporation also crystallises outstanding legal actions so that new members joining the partnership would be protected from the legacy of the past. 'It offers a psychological feeling of well-being to partners for today and tomorrow that when they go home they still have a home to go to,' says Brindle. However, it still falls short of the large accountancy firms' desire to limit 'joint and several liability', by which they can be ordered to pay all damages in a court case even if they were only partly to blame. A firm's reputation may be severely damaged or it may be driven out of business entirely by legal settlements. But it places the accountants in the same position as any company. These worries are less significant in other professions. Mr Chris Bramall, head of professional ethics at the Law Society, says that firms of solicitors have been able to incorporate since January 1992, yet only a handful of sole practitioners have so far done so. 'No one has really shown any interest in it,' he says. Mr William Corbett, chief executive of Stephenson Harwood, the law firm, says: 'The number of outstanding claims against accountants is huge. There is simply not the same level of against solicitors. When these large financial transactions go wrong the auditor is a very much closer and easier target than other professionals.' He concedes that he has considered incorporation for his firm regularly  - the last time just six months ago - but has so far ruled it out. He says one drawback for lawyers is a reluctance to disclose their fee income. Mr Bramall also highlights drawbacks to incorporation which are as important for accountants as for lawyers and other types of firm: notably the transitional tax costs of restructuring. For newly-created partnerships, this is less of an issue. More generally, there are considerable cost implications: in the payment of national insurance and health contributions, pensions and taxes. Yet the traditional benefits of partnership over corporate structure are now declining, partly as a result of the move to current year assessment by the Inland Revenue. Declining profits and falling inflation have reduced the benefits of deferral of tax that have been possible up till now. KPMG is in any case believed to be examining some tortuous legal structures involving a combination of limited partnerships and corporate shells in an attempt to ameliorate its tax bills. Incorporation has other clear benefits. Few professions have gone as far as the chartered surveyors, which relaxed their rules on incorporation as far back as 1986. A number of firms have now not only taken on a corporate legal structure, but sought outside capital through investors and stock market quotations. Access to outside investors is already possible for accountants and being considered in revisions to Law Society rules. Mr David Buck, vice chairman of Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks, the surveyor which floated in 1987, says: 'We were operating in an increasingly competitive market which promised to put a brake on internal generation of capital to grow the business. We had aspirations to become a worldwide property adviser.' He says that outside investment has not raised concerns from clients about interference and independence, but has given the company access to additional resources. He adds that disclosure of profits has proved 'a good thing' and has no regrets about the decision to go public. Mr Sharman at KPMG rejects the suggestion that outside capital as a fund for investment is a necessity - although some of the firm's activities in eastern Europe and south east Asia do suggest substantial costs that require funding. But he concedes that his interest in incorporation is far broader than purely as a response to liability pressures. He is more interested in the management impact incorporation might have: whether a corporate legal structure would better permit more corporate-style governance, or jeopardise the partnership ethos. A corporate structure might, he argues, make it easier to give long-standing non-partners an equity stake, relieve the current heavy demands for capital from newly-elected partners, and make remuneration more flexible, for example. These are problems that never troubled his predecessors, which controlled accountancy firms with partner numbers in double digits. KPMG now has nearly 600 partners in the UK alone. It is a management challenge for the larger accountancy firms that does not exist for many of their rivals - neither for the smaller accountants, or most of the lawyers and surveyors let alone stockbrokers, consultants and merchant banks that have remained partnerships. It is one they neglect at their peril.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television  Network in Hebrew at 1700 GMT on 5 May carries a 5-minute video  report by military affairs correspondent Roni Daniyel which  recounts that "the entrance of the Palestinian policemen to Gaza  and Jericho will be delayed and will be carried out in stages."  The report states that "the weapons of the Palestinian  policemen will arrive in Egyptian Rafah in approximately three  days. Later, after proper coordination with the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces], the policemen will enter Rafah and assume  immediate responsibility over the area. The entrance of the  Palestinian policemen to the other parts of the Strip has been  delayed to a later date." The report notes that these details  were concluded in a working meeting today between heads of the  Israel-Palestinian liaison committee.    Daniyel explains that the first meeting of this committee  was  held at an IDF base near the Erez checkpoint today. He adds:  "The initial stage of the Palestinian force's entrance started  today in the shape of a familiarization tour of the five police  installations in the Gaza Strip." Daniyel points out that the  Palestinians "did not assume any responsibilities today, rather  only reviewed the situation." Describing "the agreed-upon  withdrawal method," Daniyel notes: "Unarmed Palestinian forces  will enter the area while the IDF withdraws. Only then will the  armed Palestinian policemen arrive with their vehicles and  assume responsibility. The phased withdrawal from Rafah will  start next Wednesday [11 May]."    Daniyel points out that the Palestinians will be the ones  who  decide how the withdrawal process proceeds, "on the basis of  their ability to assume responsibility." "They will announce  next week what size they can control. As things look now, they  will start with the Rafah area." "The IDF is ready to evacuate  all the areas over which the Palestinians will be ready to  assume control." Daniyel stresses that both sides are striving  to prevent a situation of a vacuum on the ground, "in which  incidents can occur which both sides are not interested in."  "For this reason the two sides are coordinating an overlapping  process, wherein the Palestinians enter the area unarmed, study  the area, and take over only after they are able to assume  responsibility and rule. The IDF will evacuate the area  immediately after it receives the appropriate order."    The report goes on to quote correspondent Yoram Binur, who  says that "in Jericho too it is not known exactly when the  Palestinian policemen will arrive. It is assessed they will  cross the bridges from Jordan in the middle of next week.  Meanwhile a preliminary Palestinian police team is in Jericho,  coordinating the process with the IDF."</p>

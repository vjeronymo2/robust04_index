			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Bogdan Burileanu article: "Zhirinovskiy Dismantles </F> Romania"]    [Text] Zhirinovskiy's latest pronouncements leave no doubt  at all about the designs of Russian imperialism on Romania.  Doing us the "honor" of devoting a very suspect kind of  attention to our country, the favorite horse of the Russian  electorate has taken up once more his original thesis about the  artificial nature of the Romanian state, which, according to his  precarious historical knowledge, is inhabited by Italian  Gypsies. Now he has also found a final solution to get rid of  the Romanians: His long-term program envisages nothing more or  less than wiping out Romania from the map! The western part of  our country will be given to Hungary and the southern part to a  future Greater Bulgaria. Let us not delude ourselves into  thinking that Czar Boris' [Boris Yeltsin, president of the  Russian Federation] "clown" is dreaming in vain or that he  failed to pass his geography exams, as seems to be the case with  the history exam. The fact that his statement makes no mention  whatsoever of the northern and eastern parts of the country does  not mean that he lost sight of them. Those territories (Moldova  and South Bukovina, respectively) have whetted the appetite of  Russian expansionism for ages. Let us not forget that, in the  disastrous summer of 1940, the Romanian Army would have still  been able to defend Transylvania against the implementation of  the Vienna Diktat [which allocated Northern Transylvania to  Hungary]. But the Soviets mobilized their troops on the Prut  River, ready to move up to the Carpathian Mountains, while the  Bulgarian troops were actively dreaming of taking over all  Dobrogea. In these conditions, the Crown Council decided to  accede to the German-Italian verdict, which at least guaranteed  the country's southern and eastern borders.    Unfortunately, Romania finds itself today in a similar  situation of isolation as 54 years ago. Moreover, today's  situation is even worse than at that time, if one thinks of the  fact that there is no longer the oil stake or other lucrative  concessions which can interest the West in any way. Regardless  of what one hears, the Partnership for Peace [PFP] remains for  the time being a mere euphemistic formula of passivity toward  the same aggressive Russian claims as ever, while the United  Nations and the CSCE amount to nothing more than what the League  of Nations had been in the period between the two world wars.    On top of all this comes the Yugoslav inferno, where both  the  Islamic states and the spokesmen of the pan-Slavic trend are all  so very eager to become involved. For both of these camps to  reach there, there is but a single land route, namely through  Romania. Washed with all waters, the Muslims are refraining from  making statements, since the element of surprise and the prompt  use of any favorable set of circumstances have always been the  asset of the weak. On the other hand, Zhirinovskiy bangs the  big drum with a brutality that defies all customs, thus making  it all more threatening. It is not at all accidental that he is  throwing such an appetizing territorial bait to his fellow  travelers in both Hungary and Bulgaria, who are on the rise  there. Encouraged by these strong statements coming from the  East, it is quite likely that these forces will not take too  long to begin manifesting themselves. As for the Arabs, they  are very familiar with many strategic secrets of our country,  since they did not cater to Ceausescu for nothing. The recent  contacts established by certain extremist parties with various  political forces in the respective countries -- Ilie Verdet's  Socialist Party of Labor [PSM] with Iraq and Greater Romania  Party's [PRM] Corneliu Vadim Tudor doing the same thing on  neutral ground, in Cardiff [PRM Leader Corneliu Vadim Tudor  accompanied Romania's soccer team for an international match  there in 1993], where he sent obscure messages from the toilets  of the Welsh stadium, as we were told by some high officials of  our secret service -- come to complete the aberrant picture of  an ever closer encirclement and imminent danger. The fact that  the most vehement "nationalists" are the spokesmen of such  interests should not come as a surprise to anyone. The wolf in  sheep's clothing and the quisling have existed since times  immemorial. Nevertheless, these dissolute elements have never  expressed themselves more loudly, perfidiously, and  destructively in the entire history of the Romanian people.    There is now a real need for defining and observing the  national interest. Confronted with such dangers, those at the  helm of the country must be aware of the huge responsibility  devolving upon them for the political decisions they are taking.  After all, it is obvious that our national existence cannot be  defended now with tricky statements, greasy diplomacy, or  obscure maneuvers. Romania's place should be unreservedly and  unequivocally alongside of the Western nations, the only ones  able to credibly guarantee our existence before the ordeals  ahead of us. However, in order to be accepted and protected,  the Romanians must prove, through facts, not only words, that  they deserve the attention they really need. By mimicking  democracy, we will not manage to fool anyone. On the other  hand, we will just be left to drift alone, when fate does not  seem to favor us so much.    President Iliescu refuses, in more or less veiled terms, to  agree to the necessary change of orientation in the country's  policy. He prefers to blackmail the West with our geostrategic  position, pretending that he does not notice its main  characteristic, namely that we are just one step away from a  catastrophe, both territorial and temporal. Is his hatred or  fear of the moral values of the civilized world so high?  Anyhow, his fear manifests itself the same way as the feelings  and attitudes of Slobodan Milosevic, Saddam Husayn, Mu'ammar  al-Qadhdhafi, and more recently Vladimir Wolfovich Zhirinovskiy  do. The latter -- self- proclaimed uncontested leader of an  inevitable anti-Western offensive -- has already sealed our  destiny, a destiny which our national-socialist forces are ready  to accept, because the civilized world will never accept a Funar  [Gheorghe Funar, president of the Romanian National Unity  Party], a Vadim [Corneliu Vadim Tudor, president of the Greater  Romania Party], and the like of them. Consequently, their state  of exaltation makes them commit suicide through isolation or  self-destructive alliances. The tragedy is that, the same as  the pharaohs, they want Romania also to disappear along with  them.</p>

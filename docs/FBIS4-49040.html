			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 2 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese  Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua today urged China and the United States  to seize the opportune moment by pushing vigorously for  exchanges and cooperation in various fields.    Speaking at a gathering of U.S. businessmen hosted by the  U.S.- China Business Council here, Zou said that over the 15  years since China and the United States established diplomatic  relations, despite ups and downs, difficulties and disputes, the  overall relations between the two countries have moved forward  with exchanges and cooperation in various fields on constant  increase. The world has undergone some major and profound  changes in the past few years, but the importance of Sino-U.S.  relations remains unchanged. They have extensive shared  interests and common responsibility in many areas such as  safeguarding world peace and stability, ensuring a secure and  prosperous Asia-Pacific region, promoting global economic  prosperity and bringing about a better environment.    One outstanding feature of the post-Cold War world, he said,  is that all countries have given their top priority to economic  development. Asia-Pacific region, by maintaining the best  growth records for years running, has caught attention in the  world. On the other hand, he added, international economic  competition, as seen in fierce rivalry for market shares, has  become increasingly heated. New opportunities and new  challenges keep presenting themselves one after another.    Under such circumstances, he stressed, it behooves both  China  and the United States to seize the opportune moment by pushing  vigorously for exchanges and cooperation in the fields of  economy, trade, science and technology. "This is not only in  the fundamental interest of the two peoples, but also  contributes to peace, stability, prosperity and progress of the  world at a large," he noted.    Speaking of bilateral trade, mutual investment, and economic  and technological cooperation, Zou said, in 1993, Sino-U.S.  trade volume reached 27.65 billion U.S. dollars according to  Chinese customs statistics, which was an increase of more than  ten times over 1979, with China's imports from the United States  up by 20.1 percent over the previous year. The United States  has retained its place as China's third largest trade partner.  In terms of investment volume, the United States still leads  other overseas investors. By the end of last year, the  contractual value of U.S. investment in China had totalled 11  billion U.S. dollars, and the number of U.S. funded projects  surpassed more than 8,000. More than half of American  investment in China was made by large companies and their  projects are large in scale, high in technological standards and  quite profitable.    Facts have shown, Zou said, that it is entirely possible for  countries of different social systems and ideologies to actively  develop economic and technological cooperation to the benefit of  both sides.    Zou maintained that the differences between China and the  United States in the economic and trade fields are being ironed  out gradually with the signing of a number of memorandums of  understanding in 1992.    "What I want to emphasize is that the Chinese Government  will, as always, honor its commitment in accordance with the  requirements of the three memorandums of understanding. We hope  that the U.S. Government will also strictly honor its  commitment. In our view, all the problems between us can be  resolved by way of negotiation and consultation as long as the  two sides abide by the principle of equality and mutual benefit."    He promised that China's sustained and rapid economic growth  and its ambitious development program will surely bring about  more opportunities for the American business community. For  example, every year China imports from the United States large  quantities of wheat, aircraft, computers, chemical fertilizer,  cotton, paper, pulp, machinery, electronic equipment and  equipment for chemical and petroleum industries. It is expected  that from now to the year 2000, China will import one trillion  U.S. dollars worth of commodities from the international market.  "We hope that American businessmen will take up a larger share  of that import," Zou said.    However, he reminded the audience that competition among the  world's major powers in the Chinese market is very intense.  Advanced technology and equipment and fine service alone are not  enough. "They must be accompanied by a long-term, stable and  harmonious environment for cooperation in the economic and trade  field," he said.    "Frankly speaking," he pointed out, "American business  people  are not as advantageously placed as their counterparts in Europe  and Japan. It is very clear that the annual dispute over the  MFN status causes serious damage to the development of economic  and trade ties between our two countries."    Then he stressed that the mutual granting of MFN status is  the foundation stone for Sino-American economic and trade  relations. If this is undermined, it will do serious damage to  the economies and trade of the two countries and to the  interests of their consumers."    He deemed it the duty of the Chinese and U.S. governments to  encourage and support business people of the two countries to  conduct mutually beneficial cooperation, thus creating favorable  conditions for closer bilateral relations.    He stated that the Chinese Government always attaches  importance to the relations with the United States and has made  tremendous and effective efforts to improve and develop them.  Facts have proved, he added, that "so long as the two sides act  in accordance with the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, bear  in mind the larger picture, stand on high ground and extend the  vision, we will be able to rise above the present differences  and bring bilateral relations back on track soon for a healthy  development, thus contributing to stability and prosperity in  the Pacific rim and the world at large."</p>

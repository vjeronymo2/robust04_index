			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Northern League Secretary Umberto Bossi </F> signed "g.p." in Padova; date not given: "Bossi: `Forza  Italia? Dilettantes'" -- first paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA  introduction]    [Text] Padova -- For the moment, [Northern League  Secretary] Bossi is staying away from Rome. For some time he  had been planning a tour of election rallies and, for him,  rallies are all-important, and therefore he is not prepared to  consider postponing them, neither for Clinton's sake nor for the  sake of the differences within the majority. However, albeit  from afar, Bossi is following developments step by step,  suggesting the next moves to be made, and encouraging his men.    [LA REPUBBLICA] What is happening, Deputy Bossi?    [Bossi] What is happening is that we are confronted by a  bunch of dilettantes who are in full rout. It reminds me of  "Corrida," Corrado's TV program.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Who are the dilettantes?    [Bossi] The mistakes have been made by the people in Forza  Italia. I had told them and warned them repeatedly. I even  explained the situation in an interview. I then said: "Let us  give them a few parliamentary oversight committees."    [LA REPUBBLICA] Give the committees to whom    [Bossi] The opposition forces. Not only because of the  democratic principles involved, but also because the majority  does not have sufficient numbers in the Senate.    [LA REPUBBLICA] So what happened instead?    [Bossi] They moved to the attack. You see, you cannot say  "I won and I take everything" without having sufficient numbers.  It is numbers that count in a democracy. You bet they do.    [LA REPUBBLICA] However, some Forza Italia members are  insisting on elections.    [Bossi] They say such things to conceal their utter lack of  ability.    [LA REPUBBLICA] What about the defeat over the committees?    [Bossi] We must now see what happens. Of course, it is a  clear and very telling indication of how hard things are likely  to become in the house. We must negotiate with the opposition,  but I think that it is a bit too late now. I have been saying  so for weeks.    [LA REPUBBLICA] In short, [Prime Minister] Berlusconi is  failing to grasp the situation?    [Bossi] Berlusconi is in the hands of a bunch of amateurs.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Yes, but rumor has it that some of them are  pressing for new elections, so as to reduce the League's  strength.    [Bossi] Such people are going nowhere.    [LA REPUBBLICA] You have put an end to your flirt with the  Left, but the fact remains that, when he stood as a candidate  for the chairmanship of the Public Works Committee, League  member Bosco also received votes from the Left, and was elected  thanks to these votes.    [Bossi] The Left proved to have a good eye.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Why a good eye?    [Bossi] Because we have proved that we are the only genuine  political force in this mess.    [LA REPUBBLICA] What will happen with the anti-Mafia  Committee?    [Bossi] That is a different story. The real problem was the  permanent committees those used for governing.    [LA REPUBBLICA] But did you expect all this to happen?    [Bossi] When I read the first signs I was surprised and  worried. I told myself "This is going to end in a big mess" --  and I was right.</p>

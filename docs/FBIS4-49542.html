			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 9 (AFP) -- Zhai Weimin, a former  student leader in the 1989 pro-democracy movement, was arrested  here last month, a friend of Zhai's said Monday. "Zhai Weimin  was detained by police on April 23, and we have had no word of  him since then," the source said.    Zhai had been arrested in Beijing in early March, and was  then imprisoned in his home province of Henan, in central China.  He had returned to Beijing in late March. He is the fifth  Chinese dissident to be rounded up by police in less than a  month. Four pro-democracy activists have been arrested in  Shanghai since April 14.    Zhai, 23, was jailed for three and a half years for his role  in the pro-democracy movement, which was crushed by the People's  Liberation Army on June 4 1989. He was freed last September 13.</p>

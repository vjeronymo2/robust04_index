			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Cazenove replaced by Warburg as Steetley's adviser STEETLEY, the building materials group fighting a hostile Pounds 626m bid from its rival Redland, was yesterday shocked by the withdrawal of Cazenove as its lead broker. Mr David Donne, Steetley's chairman, has written to Mr Anthony Forbes, senior partner of Cazenove, saying: 'I and my colleagues find it wholly unacceptable that Cazenove should have placed the company in this position at a crucial stage during a hostile bid.' The rift came the day after Steetley had launched its most robust line of defence so far against Redland. Steetley has replaced Cazenove with SG Warburg as lead broker to the bid. The disagreement follows the abandonment yesterday of a joint venture plan that Steetley had propagated with Tarmac, but which was referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission during the week. Mr Donne said in the letter that when the Redland bid was announced, Cazenove confirmed that it was 'pleased to be able to act for Steetley in relation to the bid from Redland, rather than withdrawing from both companies due to a conflict of interest'. Cazenove is also broker to Redland, but is not acting for it in the bid. Mr Forbes said: 'Regrettably we don't agree with the version of events set out.' It was Cazenove's policy to stand down from both sides when two companies for which it acted were involved in a bid. The exception was when 'we are already acting for one of our companies and a third party intervenes, then we continue with the first party until that particular business is completed'. In this case, the Steetley-Tarmac joint venture pre-dated the Redland bid. Mr Donne complained that if Cazenove had said in December that its willingness to act was dependent on the joint venture continuing, 'Steetley would have appointed a different lead broker'. Mr Forbes refused to say whether or not the policy had been spelt out to Steetley at the time of the bid, but added that 'companies which have been with us know this and every company is interested in how their advisers will act in the event of a bid'. The relationship between Steetley and Cazenove goes back more than 20 years. In 1982 it helped Steetley to repel a bid from Hepworth.</p>

			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / International Company News: Allied Irish Banks advances to IPounds 139m - US market continues to be focus of future growth ALLIED IRISH Banks, the Republic of Ireland's main clearing bank, reported a 42 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 138.6m (Pounds 130m) for the half year to June 30. The group has changed its financial year to end-December and the comparable Pounds 97.4m is for the six months to September 30 1992. A strong performance in the capital markets division, which contributed IPounds 33.1m - a 38 per cent increase - and an overall 12.5 per cent reduction in non-performing loans, equivalent to IPounds 95m on a constant currency translation basis, were the main reasons for the advance. In addition, the 1992 figures were deflated by an exceptional IPounds 13.9m, which if excluded would give a pre-tax increase of a more modest 24.5 per cent. The surprise in the results was the return to profitability of the British division, which showed a IPounds 2m pre-tax profit compared with a IPounds 17.2m loss, a recovery which was not expected until the second half of 1993. Mr Gerald Scanlan, chief executive, said 'the lower interest rate environment in Britain has meant that customers there are now better able to service loans.' A sharp reduction in non-performing loans and loan loss provisions had therefore brought the division back to profitability, he said. However, he predicted that there would be little volume growth in business for the remainder of the year, either in the UK or in the group's core market in Ireland where profits declined by 11.9 per cent to IPounds 73.9m. 'We will first need to see an improvement in performance of (Ireland's) main trading partners,' he said. The US market, where its First Maryland Bancorp subsidiary reported a 37 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Dollars 93.2m (Pounds 62.5m), continues to be the focus of AIB's growth strategy. Mr Scanlan said that the move into the US market was 'to find our growth outside the Irish market. We are continuously looking for acquisition opportunities in the Washington, Baltimore and Maryland area.' An increase of only 7.9 per cent in the interim dividend to 4.1p was a source of disappointment to some analysts, but as one pointed out: 'They are retaining profits to build a war chest for acquisitions.' Earnings per share rose by 37 per cent to 12.9p.</p>

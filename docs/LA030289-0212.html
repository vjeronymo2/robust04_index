			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> INS HOUSES IMMIGRANTS IN TENTS  </P> <P> Illegal immigrants are being housed in tents after the dormitories at a  southern Texas detention center filled up with rejected applicants for  political asylum, an immigration official said today.  </P> <P> Twenty-eight men slept in a tent Tuesday night, after the Immigration and  Naturalization Service ran out of bed space for male detainees in buildings at  the minimum-security center here, INS spokeswoman Virginia Kice said. "This is  the first time the tents have been deployed," Kice said. "We've reached our  capacity." The INS has been faced with a flood of Central Americans it  maintains are filing "frivolous" applications for political asylum after  illegally crossing the Rio Grande into southern Texas.  </P></p>

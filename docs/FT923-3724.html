			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei up 3.2% at best close since March FUTURES-LINKED buying sparked a late-afternoon rally and the Nikkei average rose 3.2 per cent to its highest close since March 31, writes Neil Weinberg in Tokyo. The Nikkei ended 593.13 up at 18,875.55 after an early low for the day of 18,208.25, and a high of 18,897.63 shortly before the close. Turnover, at 320m shares, was down from the previous day's 398m, as the market lacked direction for most of the day. Advances outnumbered declines by 618 to 373, with 158 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 21.66 to 1,413.52, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 1.80 to 1,145.94. The nature of the day's trading was reflected in the preponderance of speculative issues among the 10 most active stocks, which together accounted for about one-quarter of the total market volume. Mr Chris Ringer, equity sales manager at County NatWest Securities Japan, said foreign houses intent on covering short positions ahead of tomorrow's expiration of September futures undertook heavy index arbitrage, buying stocks in Tokyo and selling futures in Singapore. Other market observers agreed that, barring a fundamental boost, such as an improved profit outlook or an economic upturn, the measures unveiled by the government to support stock prices were likely to do little more than prevent another precipitous fall in values. Lacking fresh incentives, investors focused once again on speculative, theme-related stocks, with several recording daily limit gains. Nissin Food forged ahead Y400 to Y2,730 on news that it has signed an agreement with a UK company to develop and market an Aids cure. Other biotechnology and pharmaceutical shares also surged, with Green Cross adding Y150 at Y1,880 and Meiji Milk Y50 at Y1,190. Rhythm Watch, which issued Dollars 50m in warrant bonds the previous day, jumped Y36 to Y446, while Isuzu Motors advanced Y23 to Y403 on reports that it has developed a ceramic engine. A handful of petrochemical shares rose sharply on news that Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, is likely to push for additional investment in the development of his nation's natural resources during his forthcoming visit to Japan. Mitsui Petrochemical gained Y30 to Y615. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone made its first advance in four sessions as brokerages focused on laggards. The telecoms giant was up Y18,000 at Y603,000. In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 122.13 to 20,058.62 on volume of 23.1m shares. Nintendo rose Y100 to Y10,800. Roundup TOKYO'S rally had little effect in the Pacific Rim. Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta were both closed for a public holiday. HONG KONG ended firmer, following Tokyo's rise and on optimism over a possible solution to the financing of Hong Kong's new airport. The Hang Seng index put on 26.4 to 5,726.99 in turnover of HKDollars 1.51bn, up from the year's lowest of HKDollars 1.14bn registered on Tuesday. Most actively traded was HSBC, which rose HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 56, followed by Cheung Kong, up 30 cents at HKDollars 22.80. AUSTRALIA's decline continued on worries about possible interest rate rises and a weak Australian dollar. The All Ordinaries index lost 23.0 to 1,478.9, its lowest close for 17 months. Turnover amounted to ADollars 235.3m. News Corp fell 98 cents to ADollars 23.62, while Commonwealth Bank lost 15 cents to ADollars 6.50 after reporting a 54 per cent drop in 1991/92 net profit. BANGKOK rose sharply, led by banks and finance stocks. The SET index advanced 12.43 to 782.85 in turnover of Bt10.4bn. Bangkok Bank climbed Bt2.50 to Bt73.50 and Union Asia appreciated Bt10 to Bt113. SEOUL ran into profit-taking on the eve of the three-day Chusok festival. The composite index fell 2.23 to 551.12 in turnover of Won335.59bn, after Won365.15bn. TAIWAN ended slightly higher after a dull session. The weighted index closed 11.74 ahead at 3,770.12. Turnover contracted to TDollars 16.3bn. SINGAPORE closed easier with activity focused on speculative, over-the-counter Malaysian companies. The Straits Times Industrial index shed 8.66 to 1,368.54 in volume of 31.6m shares, against 40.5m. MANILA saw quiet trading as the composite index fell 5.43 to 1,407.47 in combined turnover of 160m pesos. BOMBAY's BSE index dipped 2.77 to 3,201.46.</p>

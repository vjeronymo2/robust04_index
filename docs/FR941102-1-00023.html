			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Question 8. In addition to the proposal mentioned in the preceding question, are there other alternative institutional structures for the electric power industry that warrant the Commission's consideration in this Inquiry? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Question 9. What are the strengths and weaknesses of today's power pools? We are particularly interested in concrete examples related to existing power pools. Should the Commission consider changing any existing power pool practices or policies to facilitate competitive bulk power markets? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Question 10. Would changes to existing power pools be preferable to creating new pooling institutions? Is an RTG an appropriate institution to become a power pool? Or should the RTG's transmission planning function be kept separate from the pool's generation market-clearing function? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Question 11. Can a pool provide advantages to its members without unduly preferring members to non-members? How should pool members relate to non-members in an open access market? Are any improvements in information availability necessary for existing pools or alternative pooling institutions to be more beneficial? What reciprocity conditions are appropriate between pool members and non-members? How would a state policy of retail access affect pool membership conditions and reciprocity obligations? What if retail access were available in only some states in the pool? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Question 12. How should the Commission's recently-announced policy concerning comparability of transmission services be implemented with respect to alternative power pooling institutions and/or existing power pools? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V.

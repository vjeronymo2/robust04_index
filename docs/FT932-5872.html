			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Pechiney insider dealing trial opens NINE PEOPLE are due to appear before the Paris criminal court today charged with passing, or receiving, inside information on the purchase by Pechiney, the French metals and metal packaging group, of the US company Triangle in late 1988. The case, though it involves events more than four years old, has continued to reverberate through the French political and financial establishment. One of the accused, Mr Alain Boublil, headed the private office of Mr Pierre Beregovoy when the latter was finance minister. Mr Roger-Patrice Pelat, who was implicated earlier in the affair but is now deceased, was a close friend of President Mitterrand. Mr Beregovoy himself was called to give evidence to the investigating magistrate after his election defeat as prime minister in late March and before his suicide on May 1. Mr Boublil, now a senior executive of Framatome, the state nuclear reactor group, has denied passing on information allowing others to profit from buying shares in Triangle, which controlled American National Can, just before Pechiney, a state-controlled group, made a Dollars 56-a-share bid. Others in the dock maintain they concluded from market research, rather than any tip-off, that Triangle shares were a good buy. But the US Securities and Exchange Commission detected unusually heavy buying in the US stock and passed on its suspicions to the French authorities. A conviction for insider trading can carry a prison sentence of between two months and two years as well as a fine of between FFr6,000 to FFr10m (Pounds 1.18m). Where an insider trade has made a profit, the fine can be up to 10 times the profit, without limit.</p>

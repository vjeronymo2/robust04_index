			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Guillermo Endara by correspondent </F> Guillermo Rodriguez and Caracol News Director Dario Arizmendi in  the India Catalina Convention Center in Cartagena de Indias,  Colombia -- live]    [Text] [Rodriguez] Mr. President Endara, good morning.  It's a pleasure to greet you.    [Endara] Thank you very much. Good morning to all of you. I  wish you the best. I feel very well here in Colombia. It has  been very pleasant for me these last couple of days to be with  President Gaviria, with Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin, two people  whom I shall always remember because of the friendship they have  bestowed on me and on the Republic of Panama.    [Rodriguez] I understand that the last armed soldier left  the  Canal Zone and that there are no longer U.S. soldiers?    [Endara] Yes, that is right, but not armed soldiers, because  all soldiers are armed. The last combat soldier left. It was a  combat brigade that left. That was the last combat brigade.  There are soldiers left. Although they have weapons, they are  not combat weapons. There are, for instance, the military  police, the doctors, and other essential components.    [Rodriguez] Mr. President, undoubtedly one of the topics to  be analyzed and one which is of interest here at this summit,  although it is not on the agenda as the presidents said from the  beginning, is the topic of Cuba, the topic of President Fidel  Castro. Yesterday, in his second speech he said that if one  wants to speak of democracy in Latin America, another summit  like this one would have to be held in his country. What is  your opinion?    [Endara] I think we are quite clear on what democracy  signifies. Of course, he has declared himself to be a  Marxist-Leninist, and he has another concept of democracy, which  we are acquainted with after meeting people who subscribe to  this ideology. Of course, we have always respected that concept  of democracy, although we may not agree with that proletarian  dictatorship that we believe is fundamentally undemocratic. I  think there is much truth in what Commander Fidel Castro said,  but there is also much truth in what was said by the presidents  of Chile, Honduras, and I don't remember who else, but they all  stated some truths. We envision a democracy as one in which the  people express themselves through elections or express  themselves through freedom of speech, manifesting total support  of human rights, which unfortunately is nonexistent in Cuba. We  have to discuss this with him, and I believe we will have an  opportunity to do so this afternoon.    [Rodriguez] Dario Arizmendi, President Endara is there.    [Arizmendi] Greetings to the president of Panama. Mr.  President, what will be the outcome of the topic raised by Cuban  President Fidel Castro yesterday when he criticized precisely  the rest of the Latin American presidents for not dedicating a  single sentence of their 15-minute speeches to the U.S.-imposed  blockade against Cuba?    [Endara] I believe the criticism was not directed against  all  the presidents. I believe the criticism was... [pauses] it was  a very friendly criticism. I don't know if you had the  opportunity to hear what he said. It was very friendly  criticism. He referred especially to those presidents who  referred in their speeches to freedom and democracy in Cuba. He  maintains that, in addition to mentioning that, they should have  mentioned the blockade, the great achievements by Cuba in social  aspects, particularly in terms of medicine and education. I  believe that Castro is suffering from these truths, but the  presidents also mentioned other truths which is that these big  social achievements must go hand in hand with what we understand  as democracy and liberty, as exists here in Colombia, for  instance, and in the other Latin American countries.    [Arizmendi] President Endara, do you think it is possible  that the Fourth Ibero-American Summit declaration of Cartagena  de Indias will include an explicit paragraph, precisely  regarding the blockade against Cuba?    [Endara] I don't believe so. I believe this is a topic we  are going to broach, that is if we broach it again it will be at  a private meeting attended by the presidents and foreign  ministers. Now that is not the only topic we are going to  discuss in this private meeting. We will broach other topics,  which we could perhaps mention at a given moment, but we cannot  at this moment.    [Arizmendi] We imagine that the case of Haiti will also be  on  the agenda of that private meeting, won't it?    [Endara] I don't believe so. I cannot say that there is no  country that wants to broach it, but I don't think so. This is  a topic fundamentally for the OAS, and it was discussed in  Belem, Brazil, only a few days ago.    [Arizmendi] Mr. President of Panama, do you think that the  summits are going to be institutionalized and that this one has  been more fruitful than previous ones?    [Endara] Yes, of course. I believe that one of the great  achievements of the summit in Cartagena de Indias has been  institutionalizing the summits. It is now taken for granted  that the summits will remain as a permanent thing in our  countries. The fact that we have the host countries up to the  year 2001 is a clear indication of the interest in maintaining  them. I think that the great achievement, the preliminary  achievement of the summit of Cartagena de Indias is precisely  that. The first three summits were to sound out the situation  to see if they were successful. Here in Cartagena de Indias it  has been proven that the summits are like one of those big trees  that will flourish and have many flowers.    [Arizmendi] One last question, Mr. Guillermo Endara, and  expressing our thanks in behalf of our program, what will you  dedicate yourself to when you turn over power in the coming  weeks?    [Endara] I will return to my law practice. Former presidents  do not receive any pension or privilege in Panama. I think the  only thing they get is a large automobile license plate, which I  would rather pay for. I will dedicate myself to my law  practice, which is what I have done all my life. Of course, I  will not leave politics, although there is no reelection until  after 10 years. Still, it is crazy to think of 10 years ahead.  I will dedicate myself to my party, which is a very large and  good party. As of now I can anticipate, without fear of being  wrong, that in the year 1999, the Arnulfist Party, with the same  candidate it had this year, Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, is going  to win by a broad, a very broad margin.    [Arizmendi] Mr. President of Panama, thank you very much for  being with us. We hope that the rest of your stay with us will  be a very pleasant one.    [Endara] Thank you very much.</p>

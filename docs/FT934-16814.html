			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / India overcomes quake aid scruples MR P V Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, yesterday said that India welcomed the foreign funds offered by various countries following Thursday's devastating earthquake in Maharashtra, Shiraz Sidhva reports from New Delhi. Visiting the region, a visibly shaken Mr Rao pledged central government aid of Rs500m (Pounds 10.5m), saying money was 'no constraint' to rehabilitate the victims of the disaster. The government's immediate priority, he added, was to rebuild the flattened villages at safer sites. The Maharashtra state government is planning to ask for a Rs2bn loan from the World Bank for rebuilding houses. The bank will send a team of surveyors to assess the damage. The government's initial reluctance to accept foreign aid was set aside when the scale of the disaster became apparent. Officials in New Delhi say the government hopes foreign donors will contribute those relief items the country could not itself provide, such as X-ray plates. 'We have been able to (fulfil) the immediate demand for food, blankets, and medicine, and we have thousands of medical volunteers and relief workers ready to help,' said a member of the government's crisis management group in New Delhi yesterday. 'But we have allowed supplies from foreign agencies because we realise the task is more daunting than we had earlier anticipated.' Offers of aid have been received from the United Nations, the west as well as from Iran and even Pakistan, which set aside the traditional enmity between the two countries. Millions of rupees are being collected in India. Estimates of the death toll in the earthquake range from 10,000 to 30,000. In the quake-hit area, army rescue teams scrambled through endless piles of debris, continuing their search for the dead for the fifth consecutive day, their task made difficult by bad weather and onlookers who poured into the worst-affected areas.</p>

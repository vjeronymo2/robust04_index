			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Observer: Labour of love At a time when The New Statesman is once again hogging the limelight with its publicity-seeking gimmicks, it is good to see a fresh crew climb aboard Tribune, the other left-of-centre weekly. Labour MP Peter Hain, despite his once-rebellious past, is the least exciting of the new faces. He is a longstanding Tribune member and takes over as board chairman. However, new editor Mark Seddon, who is a Westminster lobbyist, and Bill Hagerty, the former editor of The People, the down-market Sunday paper, could make an interesting combination. Hagerty, who lost his job last November, says his new post of consultant editor is ideal. He wanted a day-time interest to combine with his night-time activity as theatre critic for Today newspaper. And in case the new team run short of ideas, they can always turn to Michael Foot, the former leader of the opposition and former Tribune editor, who shares an office with Tribune. When not working on his biography of HG Wells, he still fires off the occasional Tribune leader on Bosnia. Shouldn't be too difficult to give the 'staggers' a run for its money.</p>

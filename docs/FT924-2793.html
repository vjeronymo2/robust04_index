			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (3): Goodbye to paper shuffling? - Boost for office efficiency / John Kavanagh highlights significant improvements in office productivity through the use of document image processing, compared with traditional paper filing systems JUST five per cent of a company's information is held on computer and only one per cent is available on-line. Much of the rest is stored in filing cabinets, which are being poured into UK offices at a rate of 10,000 a day. As a result, executives spend four weeks of their expensive time every year simply looking for documents. It costs Pounds 75 on average to find a document which has been misfiled. These and other findings from the many studies of office productivity - or the lack of it - are used by both suppliers and users to argue the case for document image processing systems. A document is defined in different ways here. In some cases, originals such as application forms and letters are scanned in to the system and held as true images, albeit as a collection of ones and zeros that a computer understands. In other cases a document is a collection of data from a company's own computer: for example, statement data or text from a letter produced on a word processor. Here, there is no need to hold a complete image of the document, including the letterhead: if the document has to be sent out again it can simply be printed on office stationery in the correct format. Documents can also be annotated with short spoken messages, again stored in digital form. Other additions can be typed in or handwritten and scanned. All these original or computer documents, plus any additional notes, can be grouped into an electronic file, just as documents, photocopies, memos and so on might be stored together in a folder in a filing cabinet. However, there are some big differences between a document image processing system and a filing cabinet. These differences are bringing impressive increases in office productivity and competitiveness. Document systems use optical discs: the ones and zeros representing letters and numbers are literally burnt into the surface by a laser. A single 12-inch disc can store 7m characters: this means around 50,000 A4 page images or 300,000 or more pages of computer data. A storage device - commonly referred to as a jukebox - can store over 200 discs: a jukebox with 100 discs and two drives can retrieve any document from any disc and display it on a computer screen in around 20 seconds. In addition, any number of people can look at and work on the same document on t heir screens at the same time. These differences in storage space and retrieval times alone have brought big savings to organisations which are using document systems successfully. A study by Nolan Norton, a computing consultancy subsidiary of KPMG Management Consulting, shows floor space savings of 50-80 per cent, transaction time cuts of 50-90 per cent and increases in transactions per employee of 25-50 per cent, leading to staff cuts of 30-40 per cent. Such savings make it surprising, perhaps, that even in the most advanced markets, such as the UK, the number of systems can be counted in hundreds rather than thousands. This is despite the fact that almost all leading computer manufacturers are in the market. Consultants and suppliers point to two reasons: The pioneer suppliers of the early 1980s, notably Philips and then Filenet, sold systems based on their own computers and other equipment. This was in the days before so-called open systems emerged and users started questioning the idea of tying themselves to a particular supplier and computer range. The early systems were viewed largely as rather expensive straight replacements for filing cabinets and microfilm, simply to be document archives. However, developments in 1990s have led to market growth forecasts of anything from 26 to 60 per cent a year in Europe. Software suppliers have emerged to build systems based on standard equipment such as IBM-type personal computers and Novell networks, supplemented with optical disc units, document scanners and larger, high-resolution screens. These companies have put their emphasis on software to control the flow of work between staff. Links are being provided into data held on the traditional corporate central mainframe computer. Suddenly document image processing systems are no longer peripheral filing systems but at the centre of a company's business. 'Companies are literally cutting their customer-response times from days to minutes through work-flow software,' says Mr Kamran Kheirolomoom, chairman and chief executive of US supplier Viewstar, which recently launched its product in the UK through computing services group EDS Scicon. He points to Viewstar customer Texas Commerce Bancshares, which won an innovation award in October for its loan application processing system. Application forms and supporting documents are sent by fax to the head office, where the transmissions are received directly by personal computers and stored on optical discs. The work-flow software then directs the forms to the relevant people for checking credit status, other accounts and loans already held and so on. A reply is sent back to the branch by fax, with the centre having stored and handled all relevant documents without touching any paper. 'The time to process applications has been cut from two or three weeks to three hours,' Mr Kheirolomoom says. 'The company is winning business on this benefit.' The Texas Commerce Bancshares experience is confirmed by the Nolan Norton study, which shows that in manual filing systems 65 per cent of staff time is spent on shuffling and filing pieces of paper and only 16 per cent on dealing with the customer. Kamran Kheirolomoom and many others see document image processing really making its mark in so-called business re-engineering: the complete overhaul of the way a company is organised and works. This applies especially to organisations in which individuals or teams work on a document and then pass it to another team for the next action. A typical example is a company which deals with the public through application forms and telephone or letter enquiries: certainly the banking and insurance industries are currently the biggest users. 'In these cases, the work-flow and the work place are organised around the physical movement of documents, such as an insurance claim form,' says Mr Roger Sinden, an executive consultant specialising in document image processing at KPMG Management Consulting. He adds: 'This organisation structure, based on work flow, is outdated in an era of instant electronic communication.' The need for business re-engineering is underlined by Mr Chris Gill, a European director of Japanese information technology company, Oki - 'studies show that office workers' output has grown by only one per cent over the last decade while the amount of time they spend in the office has risen by 20 per cent,' he says. 'Meanwhile spending on information processing systems has increased five-fold in the last 20 years. Our research has highlighted work flow as a major problem. Productivity is hit by delays in document movements and by interruptions such as the arrival of a fax.' Factors that hinder acceptance There are still barriers to the acceptance of document image processing. One is cost. Prolonged viewing of document images demands large screens with high resolution. There is the cost of the scanner and of the optical disc drives. Work-flow software has to be added. EDS Scicon says a system with 10 to 15 users will start at around Pounds 50,000, including the special hardware and software but excluding standard networked personal computers. Another barrier is a lack of understanding of what the systems can do. Roger Sinden at KPMG says that 'some people think they can throw all their books in and the system will allow them to do full text searches on any keywords.' Optical character reading is possible but expensive and, besides, the main purpose of the systems is to store and control the flow of complete documents for business. Mr Sinden says optical character reading could be used in a small way to read identification codes added to a document; other methods include barcode reading or optical mark recognition. At Texas Commerce Bancshares identification data is keyed in using the telephone keypad attached to the fax machine. The impact that the systems can have on a business is also a barrier, in that it forces management to look at the whole way the company is run. Certainly suppliers in Europe say they are having to do a lot of work to sell their systems. Roger Sinden talks of sales efforts lasting up to two years. If the research is to be believed, during that two years the executives considering the proposal will each have spent eight weeks looking for documents.</p>

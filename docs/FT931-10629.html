			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / International Bonds: Deluge of Canadian dollar issues widens spreads TREASURERS have rushed to raise funds in Canadian dollars in the international capital markets in the past week or so, to take advantage of the favourable arbitrage conditions available in the swaps market. More than CDollars 3bn worth of paper has been raised since January 28, bringing the total volume since the start of the year to CDollars 5.94bn. Given the relative similarity of the deals, there has been insufficient demand from investors to absorb the deluge of paper immediately. Consequently, spreads on most of the new issues have widened since their launch. The main casualty has been a CDollars 300m 10-year offering from Asfinag, an Austrian government-guaranteed agency, which has seen its spread widen by 8 basis points to 48 basis points above comparable Canadian government bonds. The City of Montreal's CDollars 125m 10-year deal and Daimler-Benz North America's CDollars 100m three-year bond have seen their spreads widen by 7 basis points to 107 and 55 basis points respectively. The only Canadian dollar deal to see its spread narrow has been the Municipality of Toronto's CDollars 125m 10-year deal, by 4 basis points to 70 basis points. The over-supply of Canadian dollar Eurobonds has been spread across the yield curve. Of the 15 recent issues, seven have been pitched into the 10-year area, while the remaining eight have been split between three and five-year maturities. This has reduced the scope for further launches, although some syndicate managers believe there might still be room in the three-year area for a good-quality name. The heavy activity in the swaps market, related to the flood of new issues, has caused swap spreads to narrow. Syndicate managers say that fewer arbitrage opportunities and a saturated market should help to cancel each other out, since the former should discourage treasurers from raising more funds in this currency. This in turn should give the market a chance to digest the recent flood of paper. Underwriters hope the overhang of Canadian dollar deals will soon be taken up by investors. They are said to be attracted by the renewed stability of the Canadian dollar after its fall last year, triggered by constitutional concerns and casualties in the corporate sector. Furthermore, the volatility in the European currency markets last week has increased demand for paper denominated in 'safe haven' currencies such as US and Canadian dollars. Analysts believe Canadian government bonds look cheap against their US counterparts. They expect the recent reduction in the yield differential between the two to continue. In the 10-year area of the curve, for example, the differential has narrowed to 146 basis points from 158 basis points a week ago, and some analysts expect a further narrowing of some 60 basis points in the coming months. An improved outlook for the Canadian economy - its gross domestic product is expected to grow by 3 1/2 per cent this year after an expected rise of 1 1/2 per cent in 1992 - as well as subdued inflation prospects of around 2 per cent have also encouraged investors to return. While the recent spate of issues has been led by foreign borrowers, some Canadian borrowers have tapped the market. Many Canadian provinces continue to face heavy financing needs, and could add supply to the market at a later date. Syndicate managers say that for Canadian borrowers there is currently not much difference between the cost of borrowing in the domestic market and the Eurobond market. However, if the Canadian dollar continues to recover against European currencies, it could encourage greater demand among European investors eager to make currency gains. This in turn could cause Eurobond spreads to narrow, which would reduce the borrowing costs for Canadian issuers. The Province of Ontario has not participated so far in the recent rush for Canadian dollar Eurobonds, mainly because it has fulfilled its fiscal 1992-1993 funding programme of CDollars 10.9bn with a USDollars 3bn 10-year offering in January. KommuneKredit of Denmark has signed a USDollars 1bn Euro medium term note programme. Lehman Brothers International and Lehman Brothers Bankhaus acted as arrangers and the notes will be rated Aa1 by Moody's Investors Service.</p>

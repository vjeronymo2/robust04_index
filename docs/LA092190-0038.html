The first was filed this week against a Bronx video retailer. A court  order also allows for the seizure of any pirate cassettes of "GoodFellas" in  the New York area. Investigative units of the Motion Picture Assn. of America  and a private investigation firm are searching for pirate copies. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

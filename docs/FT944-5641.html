			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Berlusconi averts strike with retreat on pensions The Italian government yesterday averted a damaging general strike due today by making concessions to the country's trade unions over pension reform and cuts in welfare payments. Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, insisted that the concessions did not alter the overall aim of the 1995 budget to find an extra L50,000bn (Pounds 2.8bn) in spending cuts and fresh revenues. The agreement will now ensure the approval of the 1995 budget in parliament, but it has underlined the weaknesses of Mr Berlusconi's coalition and does nothing to remove the threat of the Northern League, his most troublesome coalition partner, leaving the government. The financial markets reacted cautiously but positively, with the lira strengthening against the D-Mark to L1,027 against Wednesday's L1,029. Analysts said the markets were relieved that the destabilising consequences of a serious confrontation between government and the unions had been headed off. But they reserved judgment until the government detailed how it would cover the L4,000bn cost of the deal with the unions. The agreement was reached against the threat of an eight-hour general strike in a marathon 22-hour negotiating session. Cuts in Italy's costly state pension system were an integral part of the money-saving measures proposed in the 1995 budget. The unions had carried out a four-hour general strike on October 14 and on November 12 mobilised 1.5m people at a protest in Rome against the cuts. The unions argued that pension reform had to be considered more carefully and should not be linked directly to next year's budget. The government refused to accept that argument, afraid the budget would be diluted and pension reform postponed. However, the populist Northern League had increasingly sided with the unions against its rightwing coalition partners, and the government faced a tough battle in the senate where it lacked a clear majority. Mr Berlusconi agreed yesterday to allow until June for the preparation of pension reform and made the unions leading partners in the discussions. This means dropping two key proposals - penalising early retirement and a reduction in the rate at which pensions entitlements accrue. In return the unions have agreed to a freeze on new people eligible to start taking up their pension entitlements actually doing so until June. The rightwing coalition also took on board union requests to earmark more funds to boost employment in the south, raise investment in research and development and training, as well as provide more help for low income families. The government will also return some L1,000bn during 1995 lost to wage earners through fiscal drag. Game player of the right, Page 14</p>

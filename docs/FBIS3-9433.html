			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy by correspondent </F> Jerzy Lesniak; place and date not given]    [Text] [Lesniak] What were the topics discussed at the  private conference you recently held with President Lech Walesa?    [Oleksy] As the press is sure to know, the president said in  public that he would never again set foot in the Sejm. So I  asked him for an audience on the eve of his move to his new  residence, and our conversation actually took place in the new  premises at the Namiestnikowski Palace. It lasted for an hour  and a half, was most interesting and useful, and ended with a  modest supper. However, I will not criticize the president's  catering because I have heard that Lech Walesa is trying very  hard to lose weight.    [Lesniak] Never mind the food. Could we discuss the more  important aspects of your discussion?    [Oleksy] Among other things, we talked about the latest  conflict between the Sejm and the president, the question of the  candidate to the office of deputy prime minister, the recently  approved state budget (as we know, the legislative process is  not complete until sealed by the president's signature), the  excitement in the police force generated by the Poznan affair  (and by other things, too), the armed forces' role in the state  security system, and the preparation of the president's  legislative initiatives. The conversation would not have been  complete without some gossip, but all details of that will  remain with the interlocutors....    [Lesniak] Did the president like the budget?    [Oleksy] Neither the president nor I is pleased with this  year's budget....    [Lesniak] So why did you vote for it, along with the rest of  the coalition?    [Oleksy] Before I explain that point, let met assure you  that I know perfectly well that old age and disability pensions  are so low as to fall before subsistence levels, that the health  service is deeply in the red, that education and science are  underinvested, and that the police and the military are in  drastic need of funds. Nor am I too blind to notice the high  prices of, say, medicinal drugs, or services in the public  sector. I know how much it costs to educate our children, and I  know the social effects of unemployment, the curtailment of  unemployment benefit, and reductions in the extent of social  services available to the needy. I know the vast sizes of the  sums needed by enterprises to break the vicious circle of debt  liabilities and climbing out of the recession trough. Of  course, when viewed from such a perspective, this year's budget  cannot even hope to solve all of these problems because it is  simply not in its power to do so, and we cannot hope for  miracles. In that context, I am unhappy with the budget, just  as the president is unhappy. However, this very same, much  maligned budget is a good step in the direction of positive  changes aimed at a a policy that will be oriented more toward  social concerns. It brings with it a chance of galvanizing  economic prospects and gives rise to the effective promotion of  exports.    [Lesniak] Nevertheless, voters, including the left-oriented  electorate, demonstrate their considerable disappointment with  the budget....    [Oleksy] Individuals are not obliged to think in terms of  state interests, history, or macroscale policies. Indeed, it is  difficult to talk about any noticeable improvement in the  situation of particular families. But--so help me--it is really  most unfair to tear the government to pieces after it has been  in office for only four months! Let me point out to all those  eager fault-finders that we still guarantee the upgrading of old  age and disability pensions and wages in the public sector.  Will even that upgrading be enough to satisfy those interested?  Of course not! And let me put it to you bluntly: A lot of  water will have to pass under the bridge before we come to enjoy  universal prosperity and adequate social welfare in Poland.    [Lesniak] But there were so many promises made during the  election campaign....    [Oleksy] It is true that I often hear people say: "You  promised, but there is no improvement." However, these grudges  are not directed specifically at any concrete target. They are  not followed by the second necessary element of the  argument--the identification of an agency that would meet these  public expectations more quickly and more efficiently. In any  case, we are talking of Utopian visions here. It is certain  that not all people in Poland will find their circumstances  improving, and that is why the coalition must first and foremost  protect the weakest. I am convinced that the majority of Poles  do not expect to live the dolce vita from tomorrow  onward; that they understand the restricting nature of the curb  bit that is necessary if the country is to be led to development.    [Lesniak] So what are Solidarity's demands?    [Oleksy] I find the strikes imposed by Solidarity  incomprehensible; furthermore, they do severe damage to the  major branches of the economy as they impair the already weak  tissue of economic life. Union activists call for a revision of  the legally and democratically approved budget, unheard-of  behavior in all civilized countries, but they fail to point out  where the money is to be found, which section we should take it  away from in order to give it to someone else. Nevertheless, I  believe that the will to talk will prevail over the desire for  political confrontation. The government, which had not  concentrated much on the budget before, is now getting its  second wind and setting briskly to work. Many program  blueprints are already complete--for example, for combating  unemployment, reforming the social insurance system, and  extending wider protection to the weaker members of the public,  who are particularly at risk from unbridled market forces.    [Lesniak] We hear rumors that family benefits will be taken  away from people....    [Oleksy] They will not be taken away; they will be  rationalized. Within the family benefit scheme, 20 trillion  zlotys [Z] [per month] go to 10 million families. In global  terms, this is a large sum of money, but, at the individual  family level, it works out to a mere Z167,000 per child per  month. In better-off families, such a sum makes no practical  difference in the monthly budget. So perhaps it would be better  to raise the benefit to Z500,000 or Z600,000 per child, but then  allocate it to only the most needy--for example, to the 3  million large families? The budget outgoings would remain the  same, but the social gain would be greater. The more affluent  will probably never even notice the loss of Z167,000, while the  poorer families will receive more significant amounts of money  with which to boost the family budget. Even so, I can already  hear protesters shouting about unequal rights, just as I expect  to hear them if and when we decide to change the real estate  tax. It would be calculated on the basis of the value of the  property rather than on its area, as is done now. At present, we  pay the same tax on a palace as on a dilapidated slum.    [Lesniak] What danger areas should we fear most?    [Oleksy] First of all, the two major financial traps:  structural--that is, lasting--balance-of-payments deficit (at  present, imports outweigh exports to the tune of $2 billion),  and uncontrollable growth of domestic debt. In 1989, this  amounted to Z2.5 trillion; today it stands at Z83 trillion,  which is exactly the amount of this year's budget deficit.  There are many reasons for this state of affairs, and I do not  intend to point a finger at culprits because some reasons would  appear to be objective. However, I do try to point out to people  that Pawlak's government has very little room for maneuver, as  does the coalition of the Democratic Left Alliance and the  Polish Peasant Party.    [Lesniak] Let us now return to the first question,  concerning your visit to the Namiestnikowski Palace. What were  your impressions of the place in terms of so-called esthetic  values?    [Oleksy] To tell you the truth, I do not like the  president's new residence. I do not envy him. I would not want  to either live or work there....    [Lesniak] Thank you for talking with us.</p>

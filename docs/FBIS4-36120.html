			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Following the bold initiative announced by  Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] Secretary General Jalal  Talabani to normalize the situation in Kurdistan and remove all  manifestations of tension and conflict in the relations between  the two allied parties -- the PUK and the Unified Kurdistan  Democratic Party [KDP] -- Talabani and KDP leader Mas'ud Barzani  held a meeting in Shirin Palace Hotel in Irbil yesterday. The  meeting was attended by members of the political bureaus of the  two allied parties; Dr. Ahmad al-Jalabi, chairman of the  executive council of the Unified Iraqi National Congress, the  INC; and Major General Hasan al-Naqib, member of the INC  Presidium Council.    During the meeting several important resolutions were issued  regarding the withdrawal of the forces of the two parties and  the establishment of an operations room in al-Sulaymaniyah  including the PUK, KDP, INC, and the Islamic Movement.    It is worth noting that this important meeting took place  two  days after the historic speech delivered by PUK Secretary  General Jalal Talabani to establish security and stability in  Kurdistan. In this speech, brother Talabani announced an  initiative for a unilateral cease-fire and the withdrawal of the  PUK forces.    At the end of the meeting, Dr. Fu'ad Ma'sum, Sami  'Abd-al-Rahman, and Dr. Ahmad al-Jalabi held a news conference  attended by representatives of the media establishments in  Kurdistan and foreign correspondents. Answering a question on  the position of the Islamic Movement in Kurdistan, Dr. Fu'ad  Ma'sum, active member of the PUK Political Bureau, said: It was  decided that if the Islamic Movement abides by the cease-fire  decision, the two parties will show their readiness to disengage  their forces under the supervision of the operations room. If  the Islamic Movement persists in its previous positions, it will  be held responsible for the events by the two parties--that is,  the PUK and KDP. In this case, we in the PUK and the KDP must  defend the areas of Kurdistan, and the regional government must  also carry out its duty.    It should be noted that brother Talabani and Dr. Ahmad  al-Jalabi have held a bilateral closed meeting to discuss the  situation.    Meanwhile, there was wide-scale reaction to brother  Talabani's initiative from regional and international circles.  [passage omitted]</p>

C. Mehta, general secretary of the Indian  council of enviro-legal action, New Delhi.    This was stated by Mr. Mehta in a paper on the ``Role of  judiciary in environmental protection'' presented at the  Indo-British workshop on ``Environmental impact and risk  assessment of petrochemical industry and environmental audit''  currently being held at the National Environmental Engineering  Research Institute (NEERI) campus here.    Mr. Mehta was not present at the workshop, but his paper has  been included for consideration by the workshop participants.    Mr. Mehta noted that there are about 200 legislations in  India, which directly or indirectly relate to environment  protection. The earliest one, the Shore Nuisance (Bombay and  Colaba) Act was passed way back as 1853 and the latest one was  the Environment Protection Act of 1986. But these legislations  did not have the desired effect, he regretted.    However, a significant development in the past decade has  been the increasing number of public interest litigations  initiated by people belonging to all walks of life and the role  played by the supreme court and some of the high courts in the  protection of the environment. The courts have taken upon  themselves to expand the ambit of article 21 of the constitution  by interpreting that the right to life included the right to  live in a healthy environment.    Mr. Mehta alleged that because of the close nexus between  the  industry and the authorities, effective implementation of  environment laws have been blocked. Also, there was not enough  public consciousness about environmental issues.    Mr. Mehta has made a fervent plea for implementing the  supreme court's suggestion, made in 1956 while hearing the Delhi  gas leak case, for the setting up of environmental courts. He  noted that at present more than 4,500 population-related cases  were pending before various courts in the country with no sign  of them being disposed of early.    He cited serious environmental problems like pollution of  rivers by industries, loss of millions of acres of fertile soil  and crops due to ground water contamination by discharge of  toxic industrial effluents and alarming rate of deforestation.</p>

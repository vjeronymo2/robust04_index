Kozhemyakin by Pavel Koltsov; place and </F> date not given: "The Intelligence Officer Who Returned to the  Cold: He Does Not Promise To Swell the Ranks of the Righteous  and Miracle-Workers"]    [Text] On 20 December 1990--Chekist Day--a  minister-counselor of the Embassy of the USSR in Stockholm was  summoned to the office of the chief of the Protocol Department  of the Swedish Foreign Ministry. He was notified that Vladimir  Kozhemyakin, third secretary of the embassy, had to leave the  kingdom "for activity incompatible with his diplomatic status."  That evening Lieutenant Colonel Kozhemyakin was returning to 31  Jorvelsgaten Street, to the Soviet Embassy, from a routine  operation ("a meeting in the city"), still unaware that his  mission in Sweden was over. This had been preceded neither by a  foulup in work nor negligence, even. The chance of an  intelligence professional being deported from a country always  increases if he is an active worker. An analysis of the Center  showed that Kozhemyakin's deportation was also in fact a  "preventive action" of the SEPO Swedish counterintelligence.  When, that inclement day around Christmas, the five-deck ferry  Ilich, sounding its horn in the fog, approached the  Leningrad moorings, Lieutenant Colonel V.N. Kozhemyakin (a  native of Moscow, born in 1956, career officer of the KGB First  Main Administration, member of the CPSU, married with two sons,  from a serviceman's family) was in a state in which, in everyday  language, his heart was not where it should be. For he had after  long soul-searching adopted the firm decision to quit  intelligence without waiting for a new assignment. He had  written in his report that he had serious reasons for leaving  the profession and testing his mettle in another field. In  February 1991 V.N. Kozhemyakin, political adviser, showed up in  the administrative system of the Supreme Soviet of Russia. The  operations officer had become a desk analyst. Today Vladimir  Kozhemyakin stands at No. 11 on the electoral slate of the PRES  (Party of Russian Unity and Accord) and is running for the State  Duma in Moscow's Tsentralnyy District 202.    [Koltsov] You are a retired intelligence officer and  fledgling politician. Do you feel yourself to be in the right  place?    [Kozhemyakin] I would not say that I have become a real  politician. I will say only that the world of politics is  tougher than that of intelligence.    [Koltsov] When you handed in your discharge application, did  the KGB turn its back on you?    [Kozhemyakin] Far from all my colleagues in the First Main  Administration approved of my decision. But nor did anyone try  to throw a wrench in the works. I have kept up friendly  relations with many of my fellow employees. We hoist a glass on  Chekist Day.    [Koltsov] The opinion has often been expressed that the KGB  was called upon to defend the safe transformation of Soviet  society ("perestroyka"), but failed to cope with this  assignment. It is said that the KGB was inefficient, and  reference is made to amateurish miscalculations in the  performance of operations, in Vilnius, for example. What do you  think about this?    [Kozhemyakin] Truly, the KGB, as the powerful custodian of  state interests, not only the untroubled dominion of the  nomenklatura, was required to make smooth the risk-fraught  maneuver from totalitarianism to an open society. And many  people in the committee understood this. But there were in the  leadership people who were living in the past. And if the  authorities had to oppose nationalism and centrifugal forces,  they should not have done so as ineptly as in Vilnius in January  1991, when, in addition, there was no one willing to assume  responsibility for the mess.    [Koltsov] When television is now showing old American movies  about Soviet agents operating in the West, where they are  portrayed as half-wits and criminals, what are your feelings? It  is doubtful whether even the intelligent "Dead Season" has been  shown on American television. Or is this self-flagellation also  part of the course of "repentance" following totalitarianism?    [Kozhemyakin] Even the penitent should show moderation. But  on a broader plane I will answer with lines from our party  program: "Russian culture cannot develop without extensive  contacts with world culture, of which it is a part. But  international terrorism in the sphere of culture supported by  the mass media should be rebuffed at the level of official  cultural policy. Limits on the permissible amount of television  time used for showing foreign mass-culture programs should be  established, at the 30 percent level."    [Koltsov] Many foreign intelligence people have become  defectors. And on almost every occasion this has coincided with  the recall home of an agent at the end of an assignment or  mistakes in his work. Does this not point to a dual mentality,  when a person secretly identifies with the value system against  which he is working? Or is there a more prosaic explanation?    [Kozhemyakin] A traitor is a traitor. The not-unknown  Gordiyevskiy, incidentally, was one of my first instructors in  the First Main Administration. Intelligent, urbane.... But an  alien soul--darkness. I believe that there were various motives  behind his switch to the side of the enemy: self-interest, some  scores with the authorities, unpleasantness at work, even.  "Dostoyevskiyism" is not to be sought in such characters. In any  event, in switching to the "other" side you give away your  comrades and those who placed their trust in you.    [Koltsov] You are on the slate of the PRES, the party of new  state absolutists. Someone said that the PRES had jumped like  the devil out of the snuff box, having performed some political  somersault. People who died for the sake of democracy, the  sovereignties, and the overthrow of the "imperial" paradigms  made a complete about-face, becoming state absolutists,  federalists, and geopoliticians....    [Kozhemyakin] I shall cite the eternal rightness of the  well-known idea of self-determination in politics: Whoever in  his youth was not a radical has no heart, whoever by his mature  years has not become a conservative has no brain. The PRES  appeared in the political arena not in connection with a  particular occasion--the Duma elections. Had there not been  elections tomorrow, this conservative and constructive current  among democrats would have detached itself and presented a  program of new federalism all the same. In my view, the PRES  embodies a coming of age in Russian politics.    [Koltsov] If you had to confess, what sins in the field of  intelligence and politics would you acknowledge?    [Kozhemyakin] Like all Soviet employees, I am guilty of the  sin of padding. I would have recourse in my reports from  Stockholm to the Center to the following subterfuge. By the  method of analysis of information flows I would extract valuable  and reliable information and attribute it to a specific  "source," that is, a foreigner who was being cultivated. I am  sure that this is a sin of all the world's intelligence  services, for that matter. And I have not yet amassed any mortal  sins in politics on account of the brevity of my length of  service.    [Koltsov] The West is dismayed at how far the democrats in  Moscow have gone in defending their policy against malcontents.  In turn, there are hardly any people left here who ardently  believe that the establishment of representative democracy in  Russia is a sacred goal of the West. Does it not seem to you  that we were all of a far more "pro-West" frame of mind in the  so-called stagnation years than today, when Moscow and  Washington are on intimate terms with one another? I refer not  to politicians, but to the mood among the people....    [Kozhemyakin] There is no denying it: I myself am less of a  "pro-West" frame of mind than when I worked in Stockholm. We are  certainly over the period of euphoria at the surmounting of the  confrontation with the Western world. There is coming to be an  understanding that both the fate and interests of each are  unique, although there are many common nonmaterial values.  Henceforward, I am not wrong here, I believe: If we are of a  pro-Russia frame of mind, we will be more quickly understood.    [Koltsov] To what did the president refer, in your view,  when  he told Ryazanov that at the time of the events of 3-4 October  the Ministry of Security occupied a position of noninterference  and was "protecting itself"?    [Kozhemyakin] It would have been far worse and more  dangerous  had the Ministry of Security displayed undue zeal those days in  October. Consequently, democratic instincts are taking hold in  our society. It is a bad omen for a normal society when the  special services acquire a taste for participation in domestic  political opposition.    [Koltsov] All parliamentary candidates say that they will do  good things for the electorate if they obtain a mandate. But to  put the issue the other way about: What would you, as a deputy,  not do under any circumstances?    [Kozhemyakin] I would not promise prosperity in one  constituency by itself and I would not swear that the voucher is  a particularly valuable piece of paper and that I would in  parliament swell the ranks of the righteous and the  miracle-workers.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] The prosecutor general's [Gustavo de Grieff]  questionable situation moved into even deeper water this  afternoon. When he was about to meet with Cali Cartel lawyers,  he received a surprise visit by the DEA director in Colombia.    Attorney Bernardo Gonzalez, representative of Gilberto  Rodriguez Orejuela, and Attorney Juan Fernandez Carrasquilla,  representative of Julio Fabio Ordinola Grajales, arrived this  afternoon at the Prosecutor General's Office to confirm that  their intentions to surrender remain firm. Although the slated  meeting did not take place because de Grieff left hastily to  meet with President Cesar Gaviria, the visit of the DEA director  in Colombia caused surprise. Authorized Prosecutor General's  Office spokesmen said it was regrettable that the U.S.  Government, through the DEA, meddles in the surrender process.  According to the attorneys, the Colombian Government has not  allowed the surrender.    [Begin recording]    Fernandez: In our opinion, the delay is the  government's fault.    Unidentified reporter: Why?    Fernandez: Because the government has not decided  yet to guarantee the jail. Before any more steps are taken in  the negotiations, the Justice Ministry must guarantee the  Prosecutor General's Office that the inmates will not be moved  from the place where they surrender. [end recording]    To conclude, the attorneys said that their clients'  surrender  will be done individually and not in the name of the drug cartel.</p>

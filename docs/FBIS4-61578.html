			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Potemkin] </F>   [Text] Warsaw 7 May TASS--A meeting of Russian Vice-Premier  and Minister of Economy Aleksandr Shokhin, currently in Warsaw  to attend the 3d conference on "East-West" economic cooperation  and Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak was held here on  Friday night to discuss joint projects and problems hampering  bilateral economic cooperation. The meeting will help to  prepare the upcoming Polish visit of Russian Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin.    Shokhin told ITAR-TASS they discussed ways to settle the  mutual debt problem, including the "null variants" suggested by  the Polish side. Russian and polish ministers of finance will  prepare proposals on the issue.    Sources at the Polish Government and the Russian delegation  told ITAR-TASS, gradual payment of Russian and Polish debts is  possible. A partial payment of the debt on the parity basis is  also suggested.    The sides discussed Polish participation in the construction  of the Yamal-Western Europe pipeline via Poland and joint  modernization of the Moscow-Berlin highway via Minsk and Warsaw.    New forms of payment relations were considered as well.  Bearing in mind Russia is against the return to inter-state  clearing, the Polish side agreed to consider the forms of  payment relations previously suggested by Russian banks, said  Shokhin.    Poland is concerned over guarantees of the Russian gas  delivery. Shokhin said there will be no problem if the Polish  consumers pay for the gas as good as the western ones. Russia  is also ready to take into account "special circumstances," he  said.    When in Warsaw, the Russian vice-premier also met his  colleagues from the United States, Germany and Japan.    A meeting with Japanese Minister of Foreign Trade and  Industry Eijiro Hata resulted in a statement the Japanese  Government does not plan to cut cooperation with Russia.    The sides discussed aspects of investment cooperation.  Aleksandr Shokhin offered Hata to abandon the demand for  Russian Government guarantees on most profitable joint projects  and the Japanese side agreed to think over this proposal.</p>

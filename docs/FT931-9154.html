			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Brokers and dealers profit from currency turmoil STERLING'S ejection from the European exchange rate mechanism and the UK's deteriorating fiscal position have boosted the profits of brokers and dealers in the City in recent months, according to figures released yesterday. Gilt-edged marketmakers - the band of specialists who deal in UK government debt - made record profits last year while brokers and dealers in the equity market bounced back into profit by the end of the year, after experiencing their worst losses for nearly three years. According to an article in the latest Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, to be published today, gilts marketmakers made post-tax profits of Pounds 65m between them last year, their best results since the Big Bang reforms which reshaped the market in 1986. This was up from Pounds 49m in 1991, although the profits are still dwarfed by the Pounds 190m losses that gilts specialists incurred in 1988 and 1989. The government's heavy borrowing has helped to breath life back into the market, which seemed doomed to be quiet backwater of the financial markets as the UK started to pay off its public debt in the 1980s. Trading in gilts jumped last year to Pounds 4.9bn a day, up from Pounds 4.4bn a day in 1991. Some houses are also thought to have made good trading profits from two rallies in the gilt market - one prompted by the Conservatives' election victory in April and the other by sterling's departure from the ERM on September 16. These were balanced by the reversal in the market in the early summer, when Danish voters refused to ratify the Maastricht treaty. Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the securities arm of the UK clearing bank, is thought to have performed strongly again last year, having been the most profitable gilts house in 1991 with Pounds 25.7m. Greenwell, owned by Hongkong Bank and another leading gilt firms, is also thought to have done well, after seeing its profits slip to Pounds 3.5m the year before. The gilt marketmakers' new year got off to a bad start, however, with losses estimated at Pounds 20m to Pounds 25m during a gilt auction in January. UK interest rates were cut the day before the auction, driving up gilt prices. This hit marketmakers, who had left themselves short of bonds in anticipation of buying stock in the auction. Meanwhile, members of London Stock Exchange are estimated to have made Pounds 24m in the final three months of last year - a poor return on their Pounds 4.5bn of capital, but a sharp improvement after pre-tax losses of Pounds 126m in the previous quarter. The flow of rights issues so far this year and continuing buoyancy in the equity market means that profits are likely to rise further. A sharp decline in broker income in the third quarter accounted for the losses at that stage. Total income fell from more than Pounds 1bn in the previous quarter to just Pounds 739m. The boost to the stock market as sterling fell out of the ERM reversed this, with trading volumes jumping from a lull during the summer. The head of equities at one large bank in London said: 'It's self-evident that things have got dramatically better. The question now is whether they continue to get better, or whether people start bidding up salaries again.' In spite the improvement in profits, City firms continue to make a poor return on capital. Gilts houses made a return of 15 per cent on the Pounds 432m capital they had at the start of the year - by the end, it had risen to Pounds 532m. Members of the Stock Exchange are estimated to have made Pounds 30m for the year as a whole, on a capital base of Pounds 4.5bn - a return of less than 1 per cent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Durban Feb 14 SAPA -- Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini  hinted strongly at secession on Monday, saying he was preparing  to promulgate a constitution for kwaZulu and Natal to establish  an autonomous monarchy.    King Zwelithini said in a memorandum to be delieverd to  State  President F. W. de Klerk in Durban later on Monday [14 February]  that with the adoption of the national interim constitution, and  after failed negotiations to amend it, "a situation has emerged  which brings back into existence the kingdom of kwaZulu and its  full sovereignty".    "I am preparing myself to promulgate the constitution of  kwaZulu and Natal which will establish a monarchy modelled after  the best examples of democratic and pluralistic monarchies in  the world." The current national constitution "is not the  constitution of the Zulu nation, which will neither now -- nor  at any time in the future -- be bound by this constitution".    He said the Zulu nation retained its inalienable right to  self- determination and "if the society expressed by the Zulu  nation cannot co-exist with other societies in a united South  Africa, then it becomes necessary and ineluctable that the  society expressed by the Zulu nation exists on its own, with its  own territorial bases and with its own government".    King Zwelithini said the Zulu nation had always been a  sovereign one. Although his nation had been conquered, its  sovereignty had not been eliminated. "Those who conquered us,  namely the white nations of Afrikaner and British, are now  relinquishing their sovereignty over the land of South Africa.  The nation which was exercising sovereignty over the land is  abdicating its power to open the door for new nations to  exercise their sovereignty over the land. Under this set of  circumstances, I take the position that the sovereignty of the  Zulu nation is revived, and I am advised that this position is  also supported by the international law of decolonisation."    The Zulu nation had not been defeated in war or conquered by  "those who are preparing themselves to exercise their  sovereignty over the land".    "Therefore we take the position that they have gained no  right for themselves to rule over our nation, and their rule  cannot force us to merge with all other nations of South Africa  in a unified government."    The Zulu nation did not want to be ruled by a government of  a  unitary state but would be ruled only by its own government for  its own people. "I demand that you, Mr President, give the Zulu  nation the opportunity to become free once again and to choose  their own destiny for themselves."    The Zulu monarch charged the interim constitution did not  offer space for his nation's survival. Referring to the  rewriting of the interim constitution by a constituent assembly  after the April elections, King Zwelithini said the Zulu  monarchy and nation "cannot walk this road".    The king rejected the notion of a referendum in  Natal/kwaZulu  on the future of the region, saying it would become an intensely  fought party political contest between those who wanted to  "subjugate kwaZulu to Pretoria, and those who want the  expression of sovereignty in kwaZulu to be a healing of the  divisions in kwaZulu".    Earlier, kwaZulu chief minister and Inkatha Freedom Party  President Mangosuthu Buthelezi told about 20,000 Zulus packed  into King's Park soccer stadium that he wanted peace, and for  that the issues raised by the king would have to be addressed.</p>

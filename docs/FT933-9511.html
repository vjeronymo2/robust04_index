			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Nato pulls punches over air strikes: Alliance warns the Bosnian Serbs but holds back on military action MR Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, yesterday warned Bosnian Serbs that the alliance was prepared to take military action, including air strikes, if the siege of Sarajevo was not lifted. However, a four-hour meeting of the Nato Council in Brussels stopped short of ordering the strikes. The organisation insisted further UN consultation and Nato meetings were needed before action could be taken. It said any air strikes would be limited to supporting humanitarian relief efforts and should not be interpreted as a decision to intervene militarily in the Bosnian conflict. In a concession to the concerns of some European countries, it was agreed the UN secretary-general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, would decide when the first air strike would take place. Mr Worner said Nato would take four criteria into account in assessing whether Serbs had lifted the siege - the blockade of water and electricity in Sarajevo, the shelling of the city, the 'strangulation' of other safe havens and attacks on UN forces. These would be monitored daily, he added. In Geneva President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia met the peace conference's co-chairmen in the wake of their suspension last week of peace talks amid Bosnian protests over Serb seizure of Mounts Bjelasnica and Igman, key mountains near Sarajevo. Later Mr Izetbegovic said he had refused to resume talks with his Serb and Croat adversaries until Serb forces withdrew from these mountains. The Moslem president made clear he had not met Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, during the talks. 'It was only talks with the co-chairmen. . . because we established that the Serbs did not withdraw from Mount Bjelasnica.' He said he would return to the negotiating table today but would not restart direct talks on future borders of three ethnic republics until Serb forces completed their pull-out, as promised, from the strategic high ground around Sarajevo. After the meeting, Mr Karadzic criticised international calls for military intervention against Serb targets. 'The western troops are jeopardising the conference. It gives the Moslem side a chance to stall the talks by waiting for western attacks against our positions.' Diplomats say Mr Izetbegovic is holding out for Nato air strikes against Serb targets. But some believe a firm decision on the strikes would be untimely at the moment. They cite uncertainty over whether Serb troops have withdrawn from mounts Bjelasnica and Igman. A spokesman for the peace talks said the Serb flag was no longer waving over Bjelasnica. UN officials, however, could not confirm that Serb forces had pulled back from Mount Igman, which is of greater strategic significance for the Bosnian army because it controls a crucial supply route to the besieged capital. After the talks in Brussels, US officials said they would meet Mr Izetbegovic today to dissuade him from assuming that the threat of air strikes would provide salvation for Bosnian Moslems.</p>

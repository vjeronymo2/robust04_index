			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HOLDEN PROMISES CHANGES FOR VOTERS IN WILMINGTON  </P> <P> Los Angeles Councilman Nate Holden -- attempting to woo voters in a district  where people blame the Port of Los Angeles for pollution, traffic and unsightly  junkyards -- told a group of Wilmington residents Thursday night that if he is  elected mayor, he will curb the growth of the harbor.  </P> <P> "I pledge to you that this program they have in place (to further expand the  port) will end," Holden declared. "Your problems will be reduced -- if I have  to close down the harbor."  </P> <P> He also promised that if elected mayor this spring -- the primary is in April  with a runoff, if necessary, in June -- to appoint new harbor commissioners  who, he said, will be more responsive to residents' concerns. When one man said  he believed that the community had been making progress with the current harbor  commissioners, Holden replied: "Don't be fooled or used. Your problems are not  being dealt with."  </P> <P> In his wide-ranging talk before the Wilmington Home Owners, Holden also pledged  to beat the city's gang and drug problems. He offered few specifics, however,  except to say that he wanted to steer youths into a program similar to that of  the California Conservation Corps.  </P> <P> "We're going to break these gangs up," he declared. "Well you say, 'How are you  going to do that?' I pledge to do that and it will be done. . . . I want you to  know that we're going to clean up this crime. Trust me. . . . If need be, I'll  put a black-and-white in front of every rock cocaine house. That's what I'll  do."  </P> <P> The one-time state senator and former aide to Los Angeles County Supervisor  Kenneth Hahn painted himself as a candidate of the people, an outsider in Los  Angeles city government but an insider at the county, state and federal levels.  He was elected to the City Council in June, 1987, defeating Homer Broome Jr., a  candidate backed by Bradley for the 10th District seat.  </P> <P> While saying he was "not a member of the club" -- meaning the insiders on the  City Council -- Holden peppered his talk with anecdotes about his chats with  other public officials, including Hahn, Gov. George Deukmejian and even former  President Gerald Ford.  </P> <P> "You want someone who is committed," Holden told about 100 residents at the  meeting. "When I want something done at the local level, I get it done because  I can talk to the governor. The mayor can't -- and won't."  </P> <P> The homeowners had invited Holden to their meeting, just as they invited  Bradley last month. Next month, the group hopes to host the remaining candidate  in the three-man race, Baxter Ward, a former Los Angeles County supervisor.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Warm Reception  </P> <P> The group gave Holden a generally warm reception, although at least one  community leader said she was disappointed that he did not offer more concrete  solutions to the harbor area's problems.  </P> <P> "I feel tonight that they (those problems) weren't really addressed fully,"  said Simie Seaman, whose group, the Banning Park Neighborhood Assn., had sent  Holden a four-page typewritten list of questions. "I wasn't comfortable with  the way they were addressed."  </P> <P> But others seemed hopeful about Holden, who is considered a long shot against  Bradley. "He presented like he has a lot of power," said Joe Mendez, who asked  the councilman if he would consider pushing the refineries to help clean up  Wilmington. "Whether he had that power or not, I don't know."  </P> <P> Said Wilmington Home Owners President Peter Mendoza: "I like him. I agree with  him. It's time for a change."  </P> <P> Holden hammered away at the theme of change throughout his talk, often  challenging the residents -- like a preacher -- to shout out the word.  </P> <P> "Do we want change?" he yelled.  </P> <P> "Yes!" the residents replied.  </P> <P> "Then that's what we'll have."  </P></p>

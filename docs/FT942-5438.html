			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / World Commodities Prices: Spices During the week prices of both black and white pepper went up drastically, reports Man-Producten. Improving demand from American buyers for larger quantities sent up prices in India and Indonesia immediately which indicates how thin the market is these days. In the US market spot black pepper improved to about USDollars 85/lb and in Europe the grade 1 went up to about USDollars 1,750. The white pepper price went up to about USDollars 2,950 spot and nearby shipment positions. Since the new crop white pepper can only be expected as from August onwards and spot stocks in Europe and the USA are really small we might expect still higher levels.</p>

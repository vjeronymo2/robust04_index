			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / United Biscuits boosted by US and European operations UNITED BISCUITS lifted pre-tax profits by 8 per cent to Pounds 211.3m last year, thanks to solid performances by its US and continental European operations which offset weak trading in the UK. Mr Robert Clarke, chairman, said the results, were 'highly creditable' in difficult economic conditions. He forecast satisfactory profits and earnings this year although there was no sign of an upturn in the group's main markets. The results, above market expectations, compared with Pounds 195.1m last time. Sales advanced to Pounds 2.98bn against Pounds 2.72bn. The fastest growth was in the McVitie's division's continental operations, where acquisitions contributed to operating profit of Pounds 14.6m, up from Pounds 5.2m, on sales of Pounds 217.9m (Pounds 103.9m). KP Snacks' continental business also did well, increasing profit to Pounds 6.6m from Pounds 5.4m on sales of Pounds 140.4m (Pounds 99.1m). In the US, where product launches helped Keebler lift its market share, trading profit rose to Pounds 65.6m from Pounds 54.7m. Sales were Pounds 983m compared with Pounds 900.8m. A change in Keebler's accounting policy to reflect the cost of US post-retirement healthcare benefits reduced United Biscuit's pre-tax profits by Pounds 3.1m. The previous year's figures have been re-stated to reflect the change. In the UK, results were depressed by sluggish demand and trading down by consumers. McVitie's lost volume market share but increased profit to Pounds 92.1m against Pounds 85.6m on sales of Pounds 586m up from Pounds 548.6m, while KP's profit rose to Pounds 36.9m from Pounds 36.1m on sales of Pounds 363.9m (against Pounds 343.2m). Terry's was hit by a fall in demand for boxed chocolates, and profit edged up to Pounds 14.3m from Pounds 14m on sales of Pounds 143.4m against Pounds 138.9m. Profits of Ross Young's frozen foods operation fell to Pounds 27.5m (against Pounds 30.1m) on lower sales of Pounds 542.9m, down from Pounds 564.4m. United Biscuits said rationalisation had given Ross Young's a competitive cost base. Acquisitions overseas and the UK recession meant only 53 per cent of the group's sales and 64 per cent of profit were generated in Britain last year, the lowest in its history. Earnings rose 9 per cent to 29.5p per share on a fully diluted basis compared with 27.1p a year ago. Undiluted earnings were 30.8p (28.9p). The interim dividend is raised to 5.5p (5.3p) for a full-year total of 9.8p (9.1p). Lex, Page 18; Market, Page 40</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Caroline Faraj] </F>   [Excerpt] Jordan's Ambassador to Yemen Dr. Fayiz al-Rabi'  has said no final decision has been made yet on the return of  the Jordanian military committee to Jordan, having finished the  mission it was officially assigned.    In a telephone interview with AL-RA'Y, Dr. al-Rabi' said the  Jordanian military committee is now awaiting further missions.  This, however, is a political, rather than a military, decision.    Dr. al-Rabi' denied reports that the members of the  Jordanian  side in the joint Jordanian-Omani military committee supervising  the implementation of the accord document in Yemen have returned  to their country following the completion of their mission.    The members of the Jordanian military committee are still in  Yemen. Only certain officers returned to Amman, having spent  the 'Id al-Fitr holiday in Yemen, while the officers who spent  their holiday in Jordan returned to Yemen. The members of the  Omani Army returned to their country and no final decision has  been made on their return or reassignment to other missions in  Yemen.    He said contacts are continuing between the three parties --  Yemen, Jordan, and Oman -- on the future missions of the  military committee. [passage omitted]</p>

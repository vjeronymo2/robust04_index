Rutskoy, at the Head of Combatants, Will Stand Up to  Zhirinovskiy"]    [Text] The somewhat dubious prospect of ensuring national  concord hardly inspired the State Duma deputies during  yesterday's voting for a package containing the elements  "memorandum of accord, amnesty, political amnesty, abolition of  the commission to investigate the October events." It is more  logical to assume that lying behind the slogan of universal  conciliation are quite concrete political interests whose  coordination was reduced to commonplace bargaining.    The agro-communist bloc, which sought to the very end to  uphold the "investigation" commission, tried to use the package  for just another attack on President Yeltsin. Gennadiy  Zyuganov's supporters were ready to agree to the prospect that  the inmates to be released from Lefortovo can pose serious  competition for the "legal" opposition and cause just another  split within communist ranks. Yet even the threat of renewed  political activity by Russian Communist Workers Party leader  Viktor Anpilov did not keep them from the temptation to  demonstrate their fighting spirit to the Kremlin. True, it needs  to be recognized that the liquidation of the parliamentary  commission was a fairly tangible fly in the ointment for the  Russian Federation Communist Party and the Agrarian Party of  Russia.    Sergey Shakhray, traditional author of various  "compromises,"  according to Deputy Viktor Sheynis (Yabloko faction), "has won  in his own game: Now he will be called the father of national  accord." This accord, however, appears rather one-sided. It was  the Communists who rushed to congratulate Shakhray on his  impressive victory after the session. Shaking his hand,  Zyuganov's associates were happy: "At last Sergey Mikhaylovich  has waken up."    The PRES [Party of National Unity and Accord] leader  himself,  however, did not share this joy over his own "awakening." PRES'  "natural allies," i.e., Yabloko and Russia's Choice, did not  display any particular ecstasy over the proposed formula for  ecumenical conciliation. Moreover, the muffled hissing behind  Shakhray's back clearly contained the word "treachery." Having  tipped the scale in favor of the Communists (this conclusion  follows from the voting results), Shakhray has for the first  time dissociated himself from the "democratic bloc." In spite  of this, he will always be received back into the fold with  outstretched arms: His "natural allies" need heads too badly.    Russia's Choice leader Yegor Gaydar is waiting for the first  results of the "national accord" -- the appearance of "Rutskoy,  Khasbulatov, and others at the head of combatants in Moscow  streets." According to Viktor Sheynis, on the other hand, the  political revival of the Lefortovo inmates is not a catastrophe.  In fact Sheynis sees their release as a boon for the president  and the entire democratic camp.    The first "plus" is the possibility for the president to get  gracefully out of the situation where the participants in the  October events have acquired the aura of martyrs while "chances  are that they will never be indicted anyway." Another "plus" is  Aleksandr Rutskoy's participation in the upcoming presidential  elections. According to Viktor Sheynis, Rutskoy has an  electorate similar to Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's, which they will  share on an approximately equal basis. Therefore the chances  for victory by a democratic candidate in the elections are still  intact.    It is dubious, however, that Boris Yeltsin has such a gift  of  prophesy and it was for the sake of these dubious advantages  that under the Constitution he endowed the Duma with the power  of amnesty, whereupon a corresponding bill to the parliament's  lower chamber was submitted. Moreover, not to understand that  the Duma majority will add political amnesty to this draft law  points to a total lack of political acumen.</p>

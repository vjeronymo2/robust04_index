			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast: Video report from Vladivostok </F> by M. Voznesenskiy and V. Domovidov, identified by caption]    [Text] [170848] [Voznesenskiy over video of Kozyrev  arrival at Vladivostok airport] The Maritime Kray  Administration had a special stake in the meeting of the heads  of the Russian and U.S. foreign policy deparments at Vladivostok  airport.    The point is that the situation around the construction of  installations for reprocessing liquid nuclear waste from our  nuclear submarines has become deadlocked: On the one hand the  Japanese are ready to share this problem with us, and provide us  with both money and equipment. But on one condition only....    [Ye. Nozdratenko, head of Maritime Kray Administration,  identified by caption] Namely that this installation is built  in Maritime Kray and that the money goes to the Maritime Kray  Administration without the involvement of any central organs.  That is to say that all work is carried out directly, without  any middlemen, under Japanese supervision.    [Voznesenskiy] Well, he who pays the piper calls the tune.  Maritime Kray Governor Yevgeniy Nozdratenko said that he has  secured Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's support and that the  construction of the first such installation, offered by the  Japanese company Nissho Iwai, at Bolshoy Kamen's "Zvezda"  nuclear submarine repair plant is an entirely realistic  proposition. Another installation of this kind is to be built at  a Pacific Fleet nuclear waste storage facility.

John Hancock is a mutual life insurance company chartered under the laws of Massachusetts in 1862. Account UV, which is registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust, is a separate investment account of John Hancock. Account UV funds: (i) Flexible premium variable life insurance policies based on the joint lives of two insureds, issued by John Hancock in reliance on Rule 6e&hyph;3(T); and (ii) scheduled premium, annual premium and single premium policies issued by John Hancock in reliance on Rule 6e&hyph;2 under the 1940 Act.

(The Account U Policies and the Account UV Policies are substantially identical and are referred to herein collectively as the ``Policies.'' <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE> ) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Applicants have obtained exemptive relief from the Commission to the extent necessary to permit Account U and Account UV to support variable life insurance policies issued in reliance on both Rules 6e&hyph;2 and 6e&hyph;3(T) under the 1940 Act.

John Hancock is a registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a broker-dealer, and is the principal underwriter for Account U, Account UV and the Policies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Like other variable life insurance policies issued in reliance on Rule 6e&hyph;3(T), the Policies provide for premium flexibility, together with a death benefit and a surrender value that may increase or decrease daily depending, in part, on the investment performance of an underlying mutual fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Each year, as specified in the Policy, John Hancock and JHVLICO (collectively, the ``Companies'') will deduct from each premium payment a charge equal to 4% of premiums paid in such year up to one ``target premium'', to cover sales expenses. No sales charge will be deducted from premiums paid in excess of one target premium in any Policy year. The Companies intend to make this deduction only in the first ten Policy years, but the Companies reserve the right to deduct this charge for a longer period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. For Policies having a current sum insured ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> face amount) of at least $250,000, the Companies will waive one-half of any sales charge that otherwise would be deducted from premium payments. The continuation of this waiver is not guaranteed, and the Companies may withdraw it at any time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The Companies will deduct a contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') only if a Policy is surrendered in full or stays in default past its grace period. This charge is computed as a percentage of base Policy target premiums (target premiums less any component thereof that is attributable to additional rider benefits), according to the following schedule: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,tp0,i1,xs100,r300 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1For surrenders or lapses effective during  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Maximum contingent deferred sales charge  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Policy year 1  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 26% of premiums received in Policy year 1 up to 1 base Policy target premium.2 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Policy year 2  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 26% of premiums received in Policy years 1 and 2 up to 1 base Policy target premium in each year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Policy years 3&hyph;7  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 26% of premiums received in Policy years 1, 2 and 3 up to 1 base Policy target premium in each year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Policy year 8  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 83.33% of the maximum CDSC for Policy year 7. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Policy year 9  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 66.66% of the maximum CDSC for Policy year 7. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Policy year 10  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 50% of the maximum CDSC for Policy year 7. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Policy year 11  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 33.33% of the maximum CDSC for Policy year 7. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Policy year 12  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 16.67% of the maximum CDSC for Policy year 7. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Policy years 13 and later  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 0. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 8.

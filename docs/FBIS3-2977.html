The report said their talks started in the city's airport  building directly after Christopher's arrival and were expected  to cover ways of dealing with the recent spy row between the two  countries, former U.S. President Richard Nixon's visit to  Moscow, and how to build strategic partnership relations.    They will also discuss a settlement of the Bosnian conflict  and the peace process in the Middle East.    Before leaving Moscow for Vladivostok Sunday [13 March]  night, Kozyrev had said there were certain groups both in the  United States and Russia opposed to cooperation between the two  countries, especially if it assumes a strategic character.    However, he told reporters at Moscow Airport that further  development of Russian-U.S. relations should be based on the  principles under the Moscow Declaration signed by U.S. President  Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin in January.    After the talks, Kozyrev and Christopher are expected to  hold  a brief news conference.</p>

In an interview with Ken Daniels, he  explained AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] leader Eugene  Terreblanche's involvement with the events that led to the  downfall of his government.    [Begin recording] [Mangope] He said he spoke to me about  their helping us and I said: No, I can't say yes; speak to my  security people. I referred him to Mr. Cronje.    [Daniels] He didn't go on with your consent, as it were?    [Mangope] No, the people I spoke to and the people I invited  are the Volksfront [National Front] people of Constand Viljoen.    [Daniels] With hindsight now, do you think it was a mistake  -- Mr. Terreblanche coming into the country?    [Mangope] Well, I mean, he was not invited. I think it was a  mistake that when he was told to leave he didn't leave. The  people who were in charge -- my people in charge of security  repeatedly requested him to leave but he, apparently, according  to what they tell me, he would not leave.    [Daniels] Did you think the whole situation could have been  avoided altogether -- the traumatic events of the past few days?    [Mangope] I don't know. I think you should direct that  question to the African National Congress [ANC], to the  Communist Party, and to the Nationalist Party who started the  strikes. It has for a long time been the policy of the African  National Congress and the Communist Party to destabilize  Bophuthatswana, to make Bophuthatswana ungovernable, and to  topple my government.    [Daniels] But were you not facing a situation which a large  section of your people were in fact supporters of the ANC?    [Mangope] That has not been proved to me. I don't know if  you have proof of that, that is the case. In any case even if  that were the case why not allow me two days to put this matter  to parliament -- for parliament to adopt a resolution in terms  of which we would take part and that question that you asked  would be proved right or wrong -- whether I have support or not,  and also flowing from that resolution would be free political  activity for other parties because we would not engage in an  election campaign and deny others, other parties to do the same.  We were literally denied the opportunity to prove that in fact  we have...we have majority support in Bophuthatswana.    [Daniels] Could you not have held a referendum?    [Mangope] I have said all along that should the results of  negotiations be satisfactory to us and should we be convinced  that the constitution such as has been negotiated will bring a  better life for our people, we'll go back to our people, but you  know that up to the eleventh hour, which was last week, there  was an impasse. We have said, therefore, that let there be  international mediation. We are prepared to abide by whatever  the mediation ... [pauses] whatever will emerge from the  mediation, and we then will go to our people. [end recording]</p>

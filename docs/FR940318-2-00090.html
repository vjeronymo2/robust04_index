In response to the information and technical assistance needs of the family violence community the Department has established the National Resource Center for Domestic Violence (NRC) and three Special Issue Resource Centers (SIRC). The purpose of the NRC and the SIRCs is to provide resource information, training, and technical assistance to Federal, State, and Native American agencies, as well as to local domestic violence prevention programs and to other professionals who provide services to victims of domestic violence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the resource center network, the Department also awarded 21 family violence grants to assist in the development of public information and community awareness campaign projects and activities to serve as information models in the prevention of family violence. Six family violence prevention grants also were awarded to implement demonstration models/courses to train public prosecutors to successfully try cases of domestic violence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> C.

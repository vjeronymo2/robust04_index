			<p>BFN     [Text] Ba'labakk, Lebanon, June 9 (AFP) -- Pro-Iranian  Hizballah guerrillas released six Lebanese men and a retired  Syrian soldier hours after kidnapping them in Syrian-controlled  eastern Lebanon, Syrian military officials said Thursday [9  June]. They were freed overnight Wednesday after the Syrian  military command in the al-Biqa' Valley threatened to arrest  Hizballah militants in retaliation, the officials said.    The men were seized in the Ba'labakk region after three of  them were seen taking photographs outside the home of  Hizballah's former secretary general Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli.  Two of the men were identified as Lebanese expatriates who had  returned to their home villages after long stays in the Gulf  state of Qatar and the United States.    Security sources said the seven could have been taken in a  Hizballah sweep to investigate the kidnapping on May 21 of  pro-Iranian guerrilla leader Mustafa al-Dirani who was seized  from his home in a raid by Israeli commandos. Moslem  fundamentalist leaders have charged that the commandos were  assisted by local accomplices. Hizballah has been on alert  since June 2 when Israeli warplanes killed 32 guerrilla trainees  on a base near Ba'labakk.    Israel hopes al-Dirani can supply vital information on  missing Israeli airman Ron Arad shot down in south Lebanon in  1986.</p>

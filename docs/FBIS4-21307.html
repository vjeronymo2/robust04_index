Compared with 1992, last year saw a lot more requests  received from foreign law enforcement authorities for assistance  in investigating international drug trafficking activities.    The Drug Investigation Department of the police last year  received some 330 such requests from foreign law enforcement  authorities, up 50 percent from the 1992 records. According to  an official of this department, the continuous increase in such  requests in recent years is due to the fact that drug  traffickers are using Hong Kong as a connection spot for their  activities and as a place for money laundering. Meanwhile, the  route of drug trafficking has also changed in recent years.  Because of Hong Kong's effective anti-drug work, there are less  traffickers using Hong Kong as a transshipment point. Instead,  most drugs are now going directly from the Golden Triangle to  their destinations, primarily European and American countries.    Currently, Hong Kong has signed bilateral agreements with 11  countries on cooperation in investigating transnational drug  trafficking and money laundering. The agreements also cover the  exchange of suspects arrested in each other's side. Over the  past four years, Hong Kong has repatriated close to 100 suspects  to their original countries for trial.    The Drug Investigation Department of the police says that  all  transnational drug trafficking groups are characterized by a  strong organizational power, adding that it will beef up  cooperation with foreign countries in expanding the  informational network so as to deal blows at international drug  trafficking.</p>

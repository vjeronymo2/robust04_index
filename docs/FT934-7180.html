			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Three sellers at T&amp;B - Directors' Transactions THREE MEMBERS of the board of Tibbet &amp; Britten, including Sidney Gould, the vice chairman, sold a total of 258,000 shares at 730p. The shares have been trading between 670p and 760p since January of this year and one of the non-executive directors sold 50,000 shares at 750p in June. Interim results were announced in September and the chairman expected a better year once the recovery in the clothing and west European motor sectors came through. Each director retains a sizeable number of shares. At Alexanders Holdings, which holds Ford dealerships in the UK, Aleksandra Clayton, the chairwoman, bought 4,870,000 shares from T Cowie. This means that T Cowie no longer has a stake and Clayton's holding has been increased to 68 per cent. In July we noted a large purchase at 25.5p by Paul Kelly in Gardiner Group, the surveillance system company. Since, the shares have risen to 32p but have fallen slightly and Jeff Caplan has bought 130,000 shares at 25.5p. Final results are not due until March 1994. The forecast is for growth in excess of 70 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              No of Company                    Sector     Shares   Value     directors  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bemrose Corporation         Pack      10,000     39          1 British Vita                Chem      25,000     61          1 Courtaulds Textiles         Text       4,000     23          1 Farnell Electronics         Elns       7,514     38          1 Glenchewton                 Misc      35,000     11          1 Lillieshall (CnPref)        BdMa       7,500     11          1 London &amp; Associated         Prop      40,000     16          1 Macro 4                     Elns      26,000    177          1 Pentland Group              Misc      33,000     31          1 Provident Fin Grp           OthF       7,500     31          1 RMC Group                   BdMa       2,500     20          1 Spirax - Sarco              EngG       5,000     18          1 Standard Chartered          Bank      20,000    210          1* Tibbett &amp; Britten           Tran     258,000  1,883          3  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Albert Fisher               FdRe      30,000     18          1 Alexanders Holdings         Motr   4,870,000    974          1 Alexandra Workwear          Text      10,000     18          1 Amber Day                   Stor      50,000     25          1 Drayton Far East            InTr      25,000     33          1 Elliot (B) (CCRP)           EngG      10,000     11          1 Gardiner                    BuSe     130,000     33          1 Guinness                    Brew       3,128     13          1 Hillsdown Holdings          FdMa      20,000     28          1 Intl Food Machinery         BuSe      70,000     20          1 Mirror Group                 Med      25,000     38          1 N Atlantic Small Co         InTr      15,000     63          1 RIT Capital Partner         InTr      12,632     21          1 TR Pacific Inv Tst          InTr       7,000     12          1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

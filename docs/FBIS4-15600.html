			<p>BFN     [Text] Georgia's Chief-of-General Staff General Guram  Nikolaishvili says that regardless of all its problems that  within two or three years, Georgia will have an army with an  adequate fighting capacity.    In Friday's appearance on Georgian television Nikolaishvili  reported good progress in the efforts to build a national army.  The top executives of the Georgian Defense Ministry have  drafted and approved a national military doctrine which will be  very soon presented for endorsement to the Georgian parliament.    According to Nikolaishvili, the Georgian armed forces number  up to 20,000 men. Instead of calling up reserves, the Georgian  army practices regular army drafts. Nikolaishvili said up to  300,000 men in the 18 to 25 age bracket had never served in the  army. Up to ten army bases were under construction in the  republic, he added.    The army's one big problem was the officers. Nikolaishvili  explained it by financial limitations. He said a Georgian army  officer earned an equivalent of 4,000 Russian Rubles a month.</p>

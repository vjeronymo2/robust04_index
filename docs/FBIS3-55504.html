			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Pavel Shinkarenko report under the "Talk of the World" </F> rubric: "Warren Christopher's Alter Ego"]    [Excerpts] On New Year's Eve the U.S. President nominated  Strobe Talbott for the post of U.S. deputy secretary of state.  Thus on the eve of the first official visit to Moscow by the  U.S. President, the list of "portfolios" which Talbott has  already held for eight months -- special envoy and special  adviser to the secretary of state on new independent states --  has been supplemented by a new portfolio: He has become  Christopher's "alter ego."    The State Department chief commented as follows on the new  appointment of his envoy: "He is the most suitable man for the  job. I am convinced of Talbott's capabilities, his knowledge of  international relations, and his human qualities. I can  certainly say that Strobe will make a unique and long-term  contribution to the formulation and implementation of U.S.  foreign policy...." [passage omitted]    "I have known and respected S. Talbott for over 25 years and  have always regarded him as a man of enormous potential,  intellect, and insight," Bill Clinton stressed in turn. "Strobe  is coping admirably with his present duties as special envoy to  the former Soviet republics. I am absolutely convinced that he  will be just as successful in his new post at the State  Department."    This new appointment of Strobe Talbott's is viewed by  analysts on THE WASHINGTON POST as one aspect of Secretary of  State Warren Christopher's wider efforts to put right at least  two weaknesses for which he has been criticized. The first is  the not particularly inspiring manner of his public statements,  and the second is his inability to anticipate potential crises  before they occur. Christopher's entourage also believes that  Talbott will continue to carry out his principal task -- dealing  with relations with Russia and the other republics of the former  USSR. However, he is now allowed to make public comments on  foreign policy problems.    The State Department's number two has already availed  himself  of this opportunity. Speaking at the National Press Club in  Washington, he stated that "Russia is on course for reforms, and  the international community should do everything in its power to  encourage movement in this direction." At the same time S.  Talbott stressed: "When we say that we support the reforms  course in Russia, we mean the following. First, we support  political leaders who are committed to the principles of  democracy and reserve for the people the final say on who should  rule the country and what the country's policy should be. This  is why we so doggedly support Boris Yeltsin, because over the  last two years he has on several occasions resolved complex  situations to the satisfaction of the Russian people. Second,  we support economic reforms. And third, we support a reform of  foreign policy direction, which is a major component of our  policy."    Within the next few days we will see how this aim will be  put  into practice when the U.S. President comes to Moscow.</p>

			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Anger in Germany at scrapping of liberal law on abortion THE GERMAN constitutional court yesterday scrapped eastern Germany's liberal abortion law, prompting the fury of women's groups and opposition politicians in the east and the west. Ms Renate Hildebrandt, labour minister of the eastern state of Brandenburg, said: 'This is a catastrophe. It is just impossible at the end of the 20th century.' In eastern Germany, a 1972 law permitted free abortion on demand up to the 12th week of pregnancy. The court of seven men and one woman also declared unconstitutional a compromise law passed last year to unify abortion regulations in the western and eastern states. It decided abortion was no longer a criminal offence but declared that it would be subject to restrictions throughout Germany and that state funding for abortions would no longer be available. The court's six-to-two ruling, aimed at protecting the rights of the unborn child as required under the constitution, was welcomed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the Roman Catholic church. In 1991, eastern German women had 32 abortions for every 100 births, compared with western Germany's nine abortions for every 100 births. Tighter restrictions will also mean that women, who make up 65 per cent of the unemployed in eastern Germany, will not be able to afford abortions. 'Whoever has money can afford an abortion. Whoever doesn't will have to return to back-alley butchers,' said Ms Heidemarie Wieczorek Zeul, a senior member of the opposition Social Democrats. Women's groups were last night planning to protest against the court's ruling by holding demonstrations in Berlin and other German cities. The court's decision highlights the difficulty in reconciling two diametrically opposed views on abortion, and the wider difficulties of integrating east and west at the social level. In 1976 the Bonn government passed a law permitting abortion up to 12 weeks, provided a woman met certain social and psychological requirements and received medical advice. As a result, only two-fifths of abortions for west German women complied with the legal requirements. The remainder were carried out privately or took place outside the country. East German women perceived their legal rights not as an ethical issue, but as one that gave them the freedom to make decisions outside state interference.</p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Japan-US economic accord 'distant' JAPAN and the US will need more than one meeting before agreeing on a new framework to govern their economic relations, one of the Japanese negotiators said yesterday. Speaking shortly before his departure for preliminary talks in Washington, Mr Koichiro Matsuura, deputy minister for foreign affairs, told visiting journalists there was a big divergence of views between the two sides, and that it was difficult to see what kind of agreement could be reached. Rejecting US demands for numerical targets to reduce Japan's current account balance of payments surplus, Mr Matsuura said that Japan did not regard its voluntary restrictions for car exports to the European Community - or the semiconductor agreement encouraging US producers to take 20 per cent of the Japanese market - as desirable precedents for regulating trade. He said voluntary export curbs were not in accordance with the goal of the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks, which the leading industrial countries have promised to complete by the end of this year. The Japanese government now regards the semiconductor agreement as a bad precedent which should never be repeated, he added. However, there have been signs from Washington that a softer line towards numerically managed trade is being adopted, as part of attempts to make progress towards a US-Japan agreement. Mr Matsuura will be accompanied, at the talks today in Washington, by Mr Tadeo Chino, deputy minister for international affairs at the Japanese ministry of finance, and by Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, deputy minister for international affairs at the ministry for international trade and industry.</p>

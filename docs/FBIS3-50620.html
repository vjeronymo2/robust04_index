			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Defense Minister Hugo Estigarribia stated: "If  abusing the right to veto means resorting to this institutional  tool as many times as is deemed convenient, then I think the  executive branch is going to abuse it, but only to the extent  that Congress, too, abuses its powers."    The secretary of state also noted that the military law is  flagrantly unconstitutional, as is the Council of Magistrates  Law and radio broadcasting law, and added that the veto is  democracy's natural mechanism to submit a difference of criteria  or legal interpretation to a third state power.

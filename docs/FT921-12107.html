			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Back to academe in Glasgow Gavin McCrone, one of Scotland's top civil servants, is joining GLASGOW UNIVERSITY's social and economic research department where he is already a visiting professor. McCrone, a Cambridge-educated economist, was unusual in entering the Scottish Office in 1970 from academic life, first as special adviser to the then Labour Scottish Secretary. Since 1972 he has been chief economic adviser, as well as holding, concurrently, a number of senior administrative posts - including head of the industry department from 1980-1987. McCrone, 59, possesses an exceptionally lucid delivery and is one of the most open figures at the Scottish Office. In 1986 he assisted Malcolm Rifkind as Scottish Secretary when the latter gave Ernest Saunders a ferocious wigging over Guinness's broken promises to Scotland. In 1987 he was made head of the environment department, removing him from day-to-day events in industry and thus diminishing his role as chief economic adviser. Harold Mills, 53, currently the Scottish Office's principal financial officer, replaces McCrone as secretary of the environment department but no appointment has been made to the post of chief economic adviser.</p>

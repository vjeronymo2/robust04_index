			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / International Company News: Paribas plans Axime bid after lifting stake to 50% Paribas, the prominent French banking group, plans to extend its portfolio of industrial investments by taking control of Axime, an information services company. On Friday, Paribas bought a 13.2 per cent stake in Axime for FFr98.7m (Dollars 16.7m) from a group of institutional investors, raising its holding to 50.4 per cent. It announced plans to make an offer for the remaining shares in the company, apart from the 26 per cent stake held by Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the utilities group. Generale des Eaux plans to hold on to its Axime stake. Paribas has offered FFr280 a share for the remaining equity, which is divided between private and institutional investors. Axime is valued at FFr748m on the offer price. Paribas, which has interests in the information services field through the SEMA Group, said the offer for Axime formed part of its policy of becoming the controlling shareholder in 'companies that we consider have high growth potential'. Paribas has in recent years pruned its industrial portfolio by ceding some of its peripheral minority interests. Axime, which operates a payment system for tele-marketing and direct marketing services as well as providing general information services, has had a difficult time in recent years as a result of the pressures on the French market place. However, the company, which employs 2,400 people, is recovering after rationalising and restructuring its interests. It recently announced that it returned to the black with a net profit of FFr65m, on sales of FFr1.9bn, in the 12 months to June 30, after making a net loss of FFr82m in the previous year.</p>

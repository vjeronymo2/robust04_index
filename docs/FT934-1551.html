			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Tokyo comes to the aid of over-the-hill 40-year-olds The Japanese government plans to increase substantially its wage subsidies for middle-aged employees, who are the target of most companies' attempts to reduce costs by cutting jobs. Labour Ministry officials hope to safeguard as many as 1m jobs under the scheme, under which the government will provide subsidies for the wages of employees transferred to lower-paid positions and provide incentives for companies willing to take on workers 45 years or older. Japanese companies traditionally transfer older employees to affiliates or subsidiaries during an economic downturn, but cases are on the rise of group companies refusing to accept these employees, claiming that they, too, need to reduce labour costs. The trend is a challenge to the traditional system of lifetime employment among leading companies, and the government fears that an increase in the unemployment rate, now 2.7 per cent, would further undermine consumer confidence, which is already shaky. To support the labour market, the ministry is expecting to spend Y326bn (Pounds 2.05bn) or three times the amount spent during the downturn in the mid-1980s. The final figure will however be decided by the Finance Ministry during negotiations for the budget for the year beginning in April. The government will subsidise a quarter of the wages of older workers at larger companies and a third of the wages at smaller companies, and lower the age limit for the subsidies from 55 years to 45 years.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Authorization Criteria and Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM, EPA noted that sections 209(b) and (e) are in many respects alike and in those respects should be similarly interpreted. One difference between the two provisions that the Agency identified, however, was an apparent difference in the sequence of California and EPA actions. In this regard, EPA focused on the following language of section 209(b):  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> &blank;&blank;(b)(1) The Administrator shall, after notice and opportunity for public hearing, waive application of this section to any State which  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 --> has adopted standards <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->  .&blank;.&blank;. for the control of emissions from new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 --> prior to March 30, 1966. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> &blank;.&blank;.&blank;. (Emphasis added.)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> EPA interpreted the phrase ``has adopted'' to mean that the Administrator could waive the prohibition of section 209(a) after a state has adopted standards. By contrast, section 209(e)(2) provides that ``the Administrator shall .&blank;.&blank;. authorize California to adopt and enforce motor vehicle emission standards.'' EPA concluded that the difference in language indicated that California must receive authorization from EPA before it can adopt any nonroad standards or requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CARB took issue with EPA's interpretation of section 209(e)(2) as requiring California to obtain authorization before adopting regulations. It believed that for several reasons, EPA could and should follow the same process under section 209(e) as it follows in granting motor vehicle waivers under section 209(b). First, CARB argued that although section 209(e) states that ``the Administrator shall .&blank;.&blank;. authorize California to adopt and enforce standards .&blank;.&blank;.&blank;,'' sections 209(a) and (b) could be similarly construed when read together. Section 209(a) states that ``no state .&blank;.&blank;. shall adopt or attempt to enforce.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.'' The only exception to the prohibition is if the Administrator grants a waiver under section 209(b). Thus, considered together, sections 209(a) and (b) could be construed to preclude prior adoption of a regulation by a state unless a waiver is granted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CARB noted that despite this language, EPA has consistently interpreted sections 209(a) and (b) to provide that the waiver process commences after state regulatory adoption. EPA's rationale has been that the Administrator should consider a ``final'' regulation when making a determination to waive federal preemption of state regulations that may differ from federal regulations. Between the time CARB holds a hearing on a proposed regulation and submission of the final regulation to the California Office of Administrative Law (OAL), significant changes could be made to the regulation. Under the California procedures for adopting regulations, CARB releases a ``Staff Proposal: Initial Statement of Reasons for Proposed Rulemaking'' along with a Notice for Public Comment. The comment period is forty-five days. A Board hearing takes place at the end of this forty-five day period. CARB makes modifications to the regulation after the hearing. These modifications are made available for public comment for fifteen days. CARB then prepares a ``Final Statement of Reasons for Rulemaking'' in which it addresses changes made to the regulation and summarizes and responds to all comments received during the public comment period. This document is submitted to the Executive Officer, who signs an Executive Order which formally adopts the final version of the regulations. Then CARB is required to submit the final regulation to OAL, which reviews regulations adopted by state agencies. OAL has thirty days to review and either approve or disapprove. It has authority to disapprove if (1) the regulation is inconsistent with California law or (2) improper procedure has been followed. If OAL disapproves, CARB has 120 days to modify the regulation, re-adopt, and re-submit the regulation to OAL. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 33 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 33 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Cal. Admin. Code tit. 2, &sect;&sect;11340&hyph;11356 (1989).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Thus, significant changes could be made to a regulation between the CARB hearing and adoption as well as after CARB adoption due to the review by OAL. If significant changes were to occur, the waiver California received would be insufficient to cover the regulations as adopted and California would be forced to reapply for a waiver of a now final regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA finds California's argument persuasive. As an initial matter, the Agency no longer believes that the difference in language between sections 209(b) and (e) was intended to delineate a difference in the sequence of events surrounding adoption and authorization. The use of the past tense in section 209(b) (``has adopted'') was merely intended to identify the states that could obtain a waiver for motor vehicle standards. (In fact, California alone had adopted such standards prior to March 30, 1966, and therefore, all other states have been prohibited from adopting emission control standards for new motor vehicles except as provided under section 177.) EPA also acknowledges that sections 209(a) and (b) could be read to require California to obtain a waiver prior to adopting motor vehicle standards, but the Agency has not so interpreted these provisions. Therefore, sections 209(b) and (e) need not be interpreted as requiring different adoption and authorization processes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, EPA believes section 209(e) should be interpreted to allow a process like that established under section 209(b) for the same reasons EPA construed 209(b) to permit California to seek a waiver after it has adopted motor vehicle standards. It is inefficient for EPA to rule on a waiver or authorization request for what amounts to a regulatory recommendation. Until California adopts its program, neither California nor EPA can be sure that the program for which a waiver or authorization is requested is the program that the responsible official will sign into law. If there is a difference between the program submitted to EPA by California and the program California eventually adopts, any waiver or authorization granted may be insufficient to cover the enacted program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In fact, EPA received comments that illustrate the confusion that would result if California were required to receive EPA authorization before it could adopt final regulations. Several commenters were concerned that CARB had modified its proposed Utility Engine Rule twice since CARB had requested EPA authorization in December 1990. The commenters requested that EPA clarify that it will grant authorization based on the most recent version it has received from CARB and that if any changes are made after an authorization is granted, California must resubmit its authorization request. EPA believes that today's change allowing California to adopt before receiving EPA authorization resolves this confusion and inefficiency. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 34 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 34 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA notes, however, that as with motor vehicle waivers under section 209(b), if CARB substantively amends a rule, EPA would expect CARB to request a new authorization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the same time, EPA does not believe that section 209(e) may be interpreted to permit California to enforce any nonroad regulations before receiving authorization. Were California to enforce its regulations before it receives authorization, it would defeat the protection section 209(e) was established to provide_that California's nonroad program only go forward if EPA authorizes it in accordance with the provisions of that section. Thus, EPA believes that while California may adopt nonroad regulations before receiving EPA authorization, its adoption must be conditioned upon EPA's authorizing those regulations under 209(e). In short, California may adopt, but not enforce, nonroad standards prior to EPA authorization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the authorization criteria, EPA proposed that the first two criteria be interpreted the same as for section 209(b). These criteria are first, that no waiver or authorization shall be granted if EPA finds that California's determination that its standards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protective of public health and welfare as applicable Federal standards is arbitrary and capricious. Second, no waiver or authorization shall be granted if California does not need such standards to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The language of the third criterion, however, was not as clearly similar to section 209(b). Section 209(e)(2)(A)(iii) stated that no authorization shall be granted if ``California standards and accompanying enforcement procedures are not consistent with this section.'' EPA proposed that ``this section'' be interpreted to mean consistent with sections 209(a) and 209(e)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters disagreed with EPA's proposed interpretation of ``consistent with this section,'' stating that ``consistent with section 209'' should mean all of section 209, particularly section 209(b). Some commenters also proposed that ``consistent with this section'' should include section 213.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has determined that, given the plain language of section 209(e), interpreting ``consistent with this section'' to mean ``consistent with section 213'' is not a reasonable statutory interpretation. The phrase ``consistent with this section'' clearly refers to section 209, not section 213. EMA proposed to interpret this phrase to refer to section 222 of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. This would require consistency with both sections 209 and 213 of the Act. Absent any legislative history to explain the intent of ``consistent with this section'', however, this interpretation would give to the phrase a meaning clearly different than its plain meaning in light of its placement in section 209 alone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

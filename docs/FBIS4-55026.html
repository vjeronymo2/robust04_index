			<p>BFN     [Text] Dear listeners: We have just received a copy of  the letter thatAlija Izetbegovic, president of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, has sent to UN Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali.    Mr. Secretary General: Your envoy for Yugoslavia, Mr.  Yasushi Akashi, has, with his latest actions, destroyed the  minimum of trust that is a precondition for any kind of  cooperation. Our people and the international public have for a  long time been witness to his strange and incomprehensible  techniques in handling the basic issues of war or peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. In our view, his conduct and decisions  regarding the crisis in Gorazde are clearly contrary to the  corresponding Security Council resolutions and NATO decisions.  They have helped the aggressor to maintain his machine for  killing people and destroying cities. In granting permission to  Karadzic's Serbs yesterday to allow the passage of tanks through  the zone strictly forbidden for heavy arms, and securing an  escort for these tanks to be moved to new positions, Mr. Akashi  has effectively sided with the aggressor. I am sure that no  well-intentioned person, including his closest associates, can  understand or explain Mr. Akashi's conduct. It is no wonder  that the Serbs are ignoring the decisions of the international  community if its official representatives fail to observe them.  The result of such conduct is an endless continuation of the  war, which has entered its third year in this region, and an  increasing remoteness of any chances for peace.    Mr. Secretary General, it is my duty to inform you that  these  reasons make it impossible for the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government  to continue to cooperate with Mr. Akashi.    Respectfully yours, Alija Izetbegovic</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] War continues in the city of Kuito in Bie Province.  The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]  has resumed shelling the city, hitting defenseless people. Our  correspondent Abel Abraao has further details.    [Begin Abraao recording] UNITA resumed shelling the city of  Kuito yesterday afternoon, after a break in the morning. The  shelling has continued until now, wounding nine civilians --  four in Cunje commune -- and killing five others. Despite the  apparent reduction in actions by the Black Cockerel's troops  over the past 24 hours, the military situation in Kuito has not  changed in any way. It is believed that this atmosphere is due  to the losses suffered by UNITA troops over the past 15 days.  This is the assessment made by Simeone Mukume, second commander  of the operational command of the government forces in Bie.  Brig. Mukume said silencing guns only depends on UNITA. When  the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola halts their  attacks, the war will end. [end recording]</p>

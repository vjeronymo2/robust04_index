			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON D.C.;  </P> <P> WOMEN TO OUTPACE MEN IN DOCTORATES  </P> <P> Women will be earning more doctoral degrees than men by the year 2000, the  Department of Education predicted in a study entitled "Projections of Education  Statistics to 2000." The department said also that elementary and secondary  school enrollments wil rise dramatically and teachers will be paid 14% more in  real purchasing power. Women have been earning more associate, bachelor's and  master's degrees than men in recent years, but 1999 is expected to be the first  year that they exceed men in the number of doctoral degrees received. Men are  expected to continue to earn more first-time professional degrees in fields  such as medicine and law.  </P></p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: Wall Street ends its love affair with Sears Roebuck - The US retailer has lost favour Wall Street's year-long love affair with a slimmed-down and revamped Sears, Roebuck cooled when the retailer's fourth-quarter figures failed to produce the forecast accelerated earnings. Sears reported record income for 1993 of Dollars 1.7bn in a turnround from heavy losses of Dollars 3.93bn, which included restructuring costs and charges for losses following Hurricane Andrew. But per share earnings, at Dollars 4.36 for the full year and Dollars 1.39 in the quarter, fell short of forecasts of Dollars 4.50 and Dollars 1.43. The share price fell by 6 per cent. Company executives complain they were victims of unrealistic expectations. Sears' share price moved from a low of Dollars 30 in October 1992 to a high of Dollars 60 a year later, gaining at each step in a restructuring that shed the company's brokerage, credit card and real estate business and closed its venerable but loss-making catalogue sales division. Investor confidence peaked just after portions of Dean Witter, Discover and Co. and Allstate were sold to the public in popular offerings. Sears continues to hold the majority shares of Allstate, while the balance of Dean Witter was spun off to Sears' shareholders. However, 1994 will be a pivotal year for Sears. Both of its main businesses  -insurance and retailing - face intense competition and, unlike 1993, will be up against comparisons with their own strong performance a year ago. The Sears Merchandising Group posted substantial 9.1 per cent year-on-year sales advances for 1993, making it more difficult to maintain that momentum this year. This helped knock 20 per cent off Sear's share price since its peak in October. Analysts are also concerned that the retailer's new-found grip on expenses may be loosening, with the company sliding back into the fiscal liberties that toppled Sears in the late 1970s. Fourth-quarter expenses rose in relation to sales, particularly at the Merchandising Group, which poured Dollars 40m into a glitzy television advertising campaign to boost Christmas season sales. The campaign paid off. Sears stores saw sales jump 13.3 per cent in December, while most competing retailers logged only single-digit increases. However, Sears' desire to capture more of the high-margin women's clothing market has been only marginally successful, analysts say, with the sales increases coming substantially from Sear's traditional hard lines. The merchandising group's advertising expenses are likely to remain high in the first quarter due to an ambitious promotional push that made Sears the prime advertiser for the Olympics on US TV. Allstate, one of the US's largest property insurance concerns, managed to squeeze a 2.8 per cent revenue gain in the fourth quarter, and stabilised its balance sheet after taking a Dollars 1.6bn charge in 1992 for the effects of Hurricane Andrew. However, analysts are already toting up Allstate's share of the insurance costs related to this month's California earthquake. Mr Richard Nelson, analyst with Duff and Phelps in Chicago, says the quake will cost Sears between 20 to 30 cents per share in 1994 earnings, and has revised his full-year estimate down to Dollars 4.50, from a pre-earthquake forecast of Dollars 4.75 per share. Allstate itself has estimated its costs from the January 17 quake to be Dollars 350m.</p>

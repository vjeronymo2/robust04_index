			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / People: Into Bank Negara's hot seat Ahmad Mohamed Don steps into the hot seat as governor of Bank Negara, Malaysia's central bank, on May 1. Late last month Bank Negara announced foreign exchange trading losses for 1993 of MDollars 5.7bn (Dollars 2.1bn). Subsequently Jaffar Hussein, the central bank's governor for the last nine years, announced his resignation, writes Kieran Cooke. Ahmad, a 47-year-old British trained chartered accountant, has a tough job on his hands. Bank Negara's 1993 forex loss followed on from a deficit of over MDollars 9bn the previous year. For the past three years Ahmad has been chief executive and managing director of Malayan Banking or Maybank, the country's biggest financial institution. He joined Maybank in 1982 as head of its treasury division where he earned a reputation as a highly successful head of foreign currency trading operations. He will be reviewing his new bank's overall foreign exchange trading policy. The Malaysian finance ministry recently instructed Bank Negara to stop its 'excessive' foreign exchange dealings.</p>

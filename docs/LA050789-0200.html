			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: ADJUSTABLE MORTGAGE RATE INTEREST CAN DIFFER, DEPENDING  ON INDEX  </P> <P> QUESTION: I am a puzzled real estate broker. What is going on in the  upside-down mortgage market? In our town, fixed-rate mortgages are a little  over 11%, whereas adjustable-rate mortgages, after the initial six-month teaser  rate around 9%, jump to almost 11%. I thought adjustables were supposed to be  cheaper than fixed-rate mortgages, but that doesn't seem to be happening. Also,  most of my home buyers who took adjustables preferred the cost of funds index,  but now all that seems to be available are adjustables tied to the volatile  Treasury bill index.  </P> <P> ANSWER: As you know, local savings and loans, banks and mortgage brokers have  been selling most of the mortgages they originate to the secondary mortgage  market, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. But, in the last few months, these  major buyers have discovered the cost of funds index is moving very slowly  upward, whereas the Treasury bill index changes much faster to reflect rising  interest rates.  </P> <P> For example, in the last year the cost of funds index has risen only about 0.5%  whereas the Treasury bill index has gone up around 3%. Adjustable-rate mortgage  borrowers with loans tied to the cost of funds index (as I have been  recommending) need not worry about massive monthly payment increases. But, ARM  borrowers whose loans are tied to Treasury bill indexes are often shocked to  receive big payment increases.  </P> <P> The result is that lenders have suddenly switched from originating ARMs tied to  the cost of funds index to ARMs tied to the faster rising Treasury bill indexed  loans.  </P> <P> To complicate matters, a few adventurous ARM lenders now offer loans tied to  the LIBOR index, the London interbank rate, which has nothing to do with U.S.  interest rates and is not understandable to most borrowers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Should Option on Land Be Recorded?  </P> <P> Q: I have an opportunity to buy an option on land that I think I can get  rezoned for a shopping center. The option price is only $5,000. Do you think I  should record the option?  </P> <P> A: Yes. Since you are not living on the property, an unscrupulous owner might  sell to another buyer who would not have to honor your option if he was not  aware of it. Recording the option, or a memorandum of it, gives constructive  notice of your option rights to anyone dealing with that property. Ask your  attorney to explain further.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Personal Property in Sale Should Be Listed  </P> <P> Q: At a Sunday open house, the realty agent handed us a listing information  sheet about the home. It said stove, refrigerator, washer, dryer, barbecue and  drapes were included. After some heated negotiation, we bought the house. But,  when we received the keys we were shocked to discover the house was stripped  bare. The realty agent refuses to help us get the items we thought were  included because they weren't listed on the purchase contract that we signed.  However, we presumed they were included since they were on the information  sheet. Do you think we are entitled to these items?  </P> <P> A: Yes. Shame on that realty agent for failing to be certain that the personal  property items on the information sheet were not listed on the sales contract.  </P> <P> The general rule is that a real estate sale does not include personal property  on the premises. From a strictly contractual viewpoint, the seller was correct  in removing the personal property because it was not included in the sales  agreement. However, as novice buyers, you were relying on the truth of the  information sheet and the honesty of the agent to deliver what was promised.  </P> <P> I suggest you try to settle the matter with the agent's broker, but if that is  not possible, don't hesitate to go to court. Consult a real estate attorney for  further details.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ask the Right Questions When Buying a Home  </P> <P> Q: My husband and I want to buy a home in an elegant, established neighborhood  where the schools are top quality. However, the homes are about 30 years old  and some have serious problems, such as the need for new plumbing and faulty  additions built without permits. What is the best way to avoid being "taken" by  the seller and the realty agent?  </P> <P> A: Just ask the right questions of the seller or the realty agent. My favorite  is: "What are the drawbacks of this house?" To be absolutely certain you have  been told about any defects, when you make a written purchase offer, make sure  it includes a phrase such as: "Seller warrants all material defects in this  property have been disclosed in writing to the buyer." If the seller or agent  failed to disclose a problem, then you have a basis for legal action later.  Please consult your attorney for further details.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Home Seller Should Limit Repair Costs  </P> <P> Q: I am trying to sell my home, but my real estate agent isn't much help, so I  am turning to you for advice. Our home is in an out-of-the-way location and is  rather unusual, so it is not easy to sell.  </P> <P> It has been listed for sale two months and we have only received one low-ball  offer, which we rejected without a counteroffer. However, that offer said the  buyer wanted a professional inspection. We had no objections to that. But the  offer also said the seller agreed to pay for any necessary repairs.  </P> <P> Naturally, we objected to that. If we receive a similar offer with such an  inspection clause, how can we protect against unlimited liability?  </P> <P> A: That's easy. In your acceptance of the purchase offer, just add a clause  such as: "Seller to pay for any necessary repairs to the premises recommended  by the professional inspector up to $1,000." Ask your attorney for further  details.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Should Home Seller Let Buyer Make Repairs?  </P> <P> Q: We must sell our home due to financial problems. The agent with whom we plan  to list our home recommends we paint and fix up our home. Frankly, we don't  have the money or the time to do the work. However, if necessary, we could  borrow the $1,500 we need. I think we should give the buyer a credit for the  work, but my husband thinks we should borrow the money. What do you recommend?  </P> <P> A: Please listen to your husband. Getting your home into tiptop condition  before putting on the market for sale could be the smartest investment you ever  made.  </P> <P> Paint is by far the cheapest and most profitable improvement you can make.  Cleaning and repairing are other valuable home improvements. Most home buyers  have little imagination. If you don't fix up your home before selling, it will  appeal only to the bargain hunters like me.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Small Down Payment Advantages Outlined  </P> <P> Q: I think you are wrong to tell home buyers to get the biggest available  mortgage and to make the smallest possible cash down payment. If people  encounter financial difficulties, then they have a large monthly mortgage  payment and they will probably lose the house. A better idea is to make at  least a 25% cash down payment, so they can reduce the monthly mortgage payment  and minimize the risk of loss if times get tough. Why don't you rethink your  advice?  </P> <P> A: There are several sound reasons that home buyers, even those who can afford  a large cash down payment, should obtain the largest available mortgage and  make the smallest possible down payment: Uncle Sam allows home mortgage  interest deductions only on acquisition mortgages plus up to a $100,000 home  equity loan; if the home appreciates in market value, the owner's yield per  dollar invested will be maximized with a small down payment; if the owner  encounters financial difficulty the home can be sold whether it has a large or  small mortgage, and if the home has a large assumable mortgage it will be  easier to sell.  </P> <P> A mortgage is really a forced savings account. Most home owners need the  discipline of a mortgage payment. They would probably waste any slight monthly  payment savings if they made a large down payment.  </P> <P> To illustrate, suppose one home buyer purchases a $100,000 home with a $10,000  down payment and a $90,000 mortgage at 10.5% interest. The monthly payment on a  30-year loan is $823.25. However, if another home buyer pays $25,000 down and  obtains a $75,000 mortgage at 10.5% interest, the monthly payment on a 30-year  loan is $686.05. That is only a $137.55 lower monthly payment, but the second  buyer tied up an extra $15,000 cash.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Uninsured Losses May Be Tax Deductible  </P> <P> Q: A severe storm damaged the roof of our home. Although I think our  homeowner's insurance company was wrong to deny our claim, and we are now suing  them, we did not receive any insurance payment. Can we deduct our loss of about  $4,500 for repair costs on our income tax returns?  </P> <P> A: Probably. If your loss was "sudden, unexpected or unusual" you qualify for  the casualty loss tax deduction if the loss was more than 10% of your adjusted  gross income. Other examples of casualty loss deductions include uninsured  losses due to fires, floods, earthquakes, thefts and wind storms.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Know Risk of Buying With Zoning Limits  </P> <P> Q: We are considering buying a two-family duplex on a lot zoned for  single-family homes. This is called a "nonconforming use." The realty agent  says if we should have a fire, the city will allow us to build only a  single-family house. Do you think this should stop us from buying the duplex,  which we like very much?  </P> <P> A: If you understand the risk of buying a nonconforming use property, I see no  reason why you should not purchase that duplex. However, your offer should  consider the diminished property value due to the zoning problem. If a fire  should damage or destroy the duplex, rebuilding with a single-family house  might be an advantage because such properties usually appreciate much better in  market value than do small rental properties.  </P> <P> Letters and comments to Robert J.

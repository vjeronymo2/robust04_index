			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Letter: Only a market-led regime will lead to lowest cost electricity Sir, If the generators wish to slash the amount of coal they burn, that should be their decision. But they should be prepared to face the consequences in a genuine, not a rigged, market. The economic case for closing coal-fired power stations should be tested. Power stations which the duopoly (National Power and PowerGen) wants to scrap should be offered to other operators who wish to prove they can under-price the new gas-fired plant. A market-led regime would ensure that only the lowest cost electricity is sold. It is the regulator's responsibility to establish such a competitive market. If gas-fired electricity is cheaper, then more pits may indeed have to close. But it is more likely that it would be some of the new gas-fired power that would be left unsold. The government claims it wants a competitive energy policy. In that case the coal capacity which it is claimed cannot be sold should also be subjected to the market test. Other willing operators should be encouraged to take over the pits which British Coal claims are not viable, but which others believe can be operated at lower cost. Why are they being prevented from putting their money where their mouths are? Then we would preserve a fairer market for coal, saving pits and jobs. The economy would benefit from lower cost coal and our hard-pressed industry would see lower priced electricity. Proper market forces would slow down the dash for gas, so easing the upward pressure on its price to the additional advantage of energy-intensive users.

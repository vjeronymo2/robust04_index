			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Austrian group moves into Bullers Control of Bullers, the maker of giftware and decorative accessories, is expected to change under a series of arrangements announced yesterday. Gamlestaden, which holds 48.24 per cent of the company has granted an option to Auric Holdings of Austria on a 29.99 per cent holding. It has also accepted the conversion of a Pounds 350,000 loan to Bullers into 35m preference shares and given Auric the right to buy them at any time over the next three years. Auric will have the right to convert the preference shares on a 5-for-2 basis at any time. If Auric exercises its rights in full it will control 58.9 per cent of Bullers. The Takeover Panel has waived the requirement to make a full bid should shareholders, other than Gamlestaden, approve the moves. Marmara Bank, a Turkish bank, of which Mr Atilla Uras, owner of Auric, is chairman, has provided an unsecured loan facility of Pounds 550,000 to Bullers. Mr Peter McBride, Auric's representative, has been appointed managing director of Bullers.</p>

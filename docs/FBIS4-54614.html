			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 3 (CTK) -- To expect civic  reconciliation now after different political groupings joined  together against the winner of the 1992 parliamentary elections  and seized power in a parliamentary way would be either  political naivete or deliberate demagoguery, the daily  REPUBLIKA, close to ex- premier Vladimir Meciar, writes today  referring to the situation in Slovakia after the change of  cabinet.    "Meciar, as a non-corrupted and a pro-Slovak orientated  politician, has strong voter support in Slovakia, in spite of  all the attacks on him. But it is not only because of Meciar's  charisma that even people whom the Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia (HZDS) has not addressed until recently and who  preferred business to politics, are currently turning towards  Meciar's banner," the paper says.    The government coalition's attacks on the HZDS have a deeper  meaning than it may outwardly seem. "It is not only more than  200 billion crowns of property to be privatized which is in  question, although it is just this which caused the majority of  regional party leaders to miraculously change their positions,  but rather the internal development of the country and the  question of which international circles will include Slovakia in  their sphere of influence, REPUBLIKA writes.    "The internal political situation in Slovakia is  characterized by controversies. Instead of building serious  international prestige and advantageous economic ties which  would lead Slovakia to prosperity, it is acquiring the stigma of  an unstable country. Foreign investors and partners have no  guarantee that they are not investing in a country where the  political situation and economic projects change with the  weather," the daily writes.    The new government coalition had pledged to pursue civilized  policies without confrontational tones while accusing the HZDS  of doing that. "But the developments we have been witnessing  recently show how distant are the bosses of political parties  and movements from political culture, they lack the political  maturity which [is] reflected in a gentleman-like approach  towards adversaries. Attacks on the ex-premier did not calm down  even after the victorious assault of his post by temporary  allies. On the contrary, they are growing stronger, the daily  writes.    Meciar took time out immediately after the shocking fall of  his cabinet, the independent NARODNA OBRODA writes. Two years  after a decisive election victory the HZDS has weakened to such  an extent that a direct hit from the Democratic Left Party (SDL)  and the opposition put it out of parliament for six months.  However, the HZDS, the strongest political force in Slovakia  according to poll ratings, has recovered quickly from the  knock-out. The ex-premier's tactics of silence and avoiding  journalists has become its program and the HZDS has sent to the  advance front positions its "reserve snipers" such as Olga  Keltosova, Sergej Kozlik, Tibor Cabaj, and Katarina Tothova.    "This phenomenon might have at least two explanations.  Either a fight for confidence and the nomination to the  candidate slates is being waged within the movement or it is  hiding its biggest trumps -- election leaders Meciar and Ivan  Gasparovic -- to use them for the last pre-election moves,"  NARODNA OBRODA writes.    The daily stresses, however, that the shift of sympathies  during the current election campaign in Hungary does not play  into the HZDS's cards since if Hungarian Socialists of Gyula  Horn in coalition with the Free Democrats win the elections then  Meciar's Hungarian card will be set at naught.    "And finally, a protective mist over Meciar is aimed to  convince voters that he has never been and is not a source of  political confrontation. And with the loss of memory it would  be easy to believe that it was the Castle (Slovak president's  residence) and all those who betrayed the HZDS and the Slovak  National Party (SNS) who caused the confrontation. The sharpest  attacks will not therefore be directed towards the strongest  political enemies -- the Christian Democrats and the SDL -- but  against Meciar's former co- workers such as Roman Kovac, Jozef  Moravcik, Rudolf Filkus, Ludovit Cernak, and President Michal  Kovac, the daily writes.</p>

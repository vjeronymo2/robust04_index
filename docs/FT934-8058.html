			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: PowerGen moves into oil and gas production POWERGEN, the electricity generator, yesterday made its first move into oil and gas production when it bought a 3.9 per cent stake in exploration blocks covering Liverpool Bay from Monument Oil and Gas. Mr Simon Williams, an analyst with Kleinwort Benson Securities, said the investment made sense and should not worry shareholders concerned about diversification. PowerGen knows the field well because it is contracted to buy the gas for its Connah's Quay generating plant, he said. 'It is a toe in the water which involves limited risk.' Monument is reducing its stake to 20 per cent in the Liverpool Bay blocks, 110/13 and 110/15, through the sale. The consideration is Pounds 45.5m at July 1 plus interest payments and up to Pounds 3m more over the next two years depending on exploration results. Monument said the sale would release cash for investment and reduce future debt, without materially reducing exposure to Liverpool Bay. PowerGen said the purchase, subject to government consent, would be funded from the company's own resources. Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive, said the company was cash positive and would move only slightly into a negative cash position towards the end of the year. The company's interest in Liverpool Bay began when it contracted with Monument and Hamilton Oil, operator and joint developer of the fields in the blocks, and others to buy gas for Connah's Quay in North Wales. 'We have said many times we want to move upstream,' said Mr Wallis. 'Hamilton was the first company to get gas out of the North Sea. We are in safe hands.' Mr Wallis said Liverpool Bay and Connah's Quay would start to contribute to earnings in 1995 with the full benefit of both being seen from 1996 onwards. 'At this time PowerGen will be the largest single consumer of gas in the UK, one of the largest gas markets in Europe,' said Mr Wallis. PowerGen expects to contribute about Pounds 40m to development costs of the Liverpool Bay field in the next year. National Power, the UK's largest electricity generator, already has upstream assets through its 24 per cent stake in Seafield Resources and 10 per cent share of the Victor gas field. PowerGen's other interests in the gas market include its Kinetica joint venture with Conoco which is the second largest distributer of gas in the UK with a claimed 25 per cent of the available market. It also has a combined heat and power subsidiary which recently signed a contract with Grovehurst Energy for the supply from a gas fired plant of 80MW of electricity and 200MW of steam to three Kent paper factories.</p>

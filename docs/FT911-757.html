			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Call for North Sea plan rejected - Scottish Conservatives' Conference in Brief LORD STRATHCLYDE, the Scottish agriculture minister, yesterday gave no sign that the government accepted the case for a scheme to decommission fishing boats in the North Sea in order to reduce over-fishing, despite calls from Conservative party members. Mr Sandy Manson, prospective Tory candidate for Banff and Buchan, a seat with a large fishing community held by Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish National Party, was one of several speakers urging a decommissioning scheme. Such a scheme is backed by fishermen and many fishing experts but has consistently been turned down by the government. Lord Strathclyde said that no decommissioning scheme could have an immediate effect on preserving fish stocks. He said the government would continue to consider 'any viable proposals' to secure the industry's future.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / World Trade News: Brittan urges US to avoid sanctions SIR Leon Brittan, EC Commissioner for external economic relations, yesterday urged the US to avoid imposing sanctions in the partially resolved dispute over government procurement rules. Sir Leon told the EC committee of the American Chamber of Commerce in Brussels that sanctions would be 'unjustified', despite the failure of the EC and US to resolve the Clinton administration's demands for access to the Community's telecommunications market. In his speech, Sir Leon also called on US local authorities to end 'Buy American' discrimination. He said European companies offered first-rate services, but they faced barriers in contracts ranging from bridge-building across the Potomac, the planned extension of Dulles International Airport, outside Washington DC, to the port of Los Angeles. Recalling AT&amp;T's plans to challenge BT and Mercury by offering private networks to international businesses in the UK, Sir Leon said: 'If AT&amp;T wants to dig up Europe's sidewalks, good luck. But why should Europe not bid to do the same in New York?'. A US decision on sanctions is believed imminent. EC officials are nervous about retaliation because Sir Leon has no 'ceasefire' understanding with Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative. French-led pressure for a tough line on trade remains strong. After last week's partial deal, Mr Kantor said US sanctions, which would have barred European companies from up to Dollars 50m in government contracts, would be scaled down 'commensurate with the portion' that telecoms represents in EC-US contracts. EC officials insist this means that the US will avoid action in telecoms, the prize the US covets most. Sir Leon praised the agreement, saying it showed both sides could do business with each other, and that Washington was prepared at last to start dismantling 60 years of steadily increasing 'Buy American' legislation.</p>

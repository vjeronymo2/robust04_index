			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Economic recovery has yet to trigger euphoria: Norwich, Manchester and Southampton for the elusive feel-good factor The worst is over. Recovery is under way. Those sentiments are pretty universal in Manchester, Norwich and Southampton. What is missing, however, is any sense of euphoria, of a 'feel-good factor'. Mr David Herman, finance director of the Anglian Group, said: 'Maybe it's because we were in a recession for so long. People can't believe things are OK now.' His company, which sells replacement windows, is dependent on consumer confidence. He says business is 'patchy - not geographically, but week-on-week'. Nearly all the economic statistics point in the right direction. The economy grew at 3.75 per cent in the year to the second quarter. Inflation and interest rates are at 25-year lows. Unemployment has fallen 340,000 from its 1992 peak. But in spite of the encouragement given by the statistics, many business people report that they are seeing a modest rather than spectacular recovery. Mr Rod Sellers of British Vita, the Middleton-based polymer and plastics group, said: 'It's a gradual recovery. I don't think it's a boom.' Mr Terry Goddard of Dimplex, the Southampton-based heating appliance manufacturer, said: 'We're seeing signs of improvement but no underlying confidence.' Mr Peter Beebe, director-general of the Southampton Chamber of Commerce, said: 'Everywhere I go here, there remains a sense of caution. There has been a lift-off which has been sustained over the past year but it has not been a significant lift-off.' According to Mr Robert Hough, chairman of Manchester Ship Canal and president of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce: 'People talk of a slow recovery; the word fragile is frequently used.' The same picture of modest growth applies to the retail sector. Mr Ken Hunter, manager of the Arndale shopping centre in Manchester, said things were better. 'But we don't think it's good enough at this stage to say we're on a roll.' The three main influences on consumer confidence are jobs, incomes and the housing market. In terms of jobs the recovery is yielding, at best, growth in part-time and short-term employment. For those in work incomes are growing at a modest nominal rate compared with the pace of annual wage rises in the early 1980s. Business people do not seem too concerned about wage pressures. Mr Sellers of British Vita said: 'Wage increases are under control'. Mr Hough of Manchester Ship Canal echoed this: 'The wage-cost side is very subdued. Wages are rising marginally above the rate of inflation.' In addition to modest wage rises, consumers have had to cope with this year's tax increases, which at one time were widely expected to derail the recovery. Official figures show some slowdown in spending, but retailers say business has been better than feared. The housing market, which has often been the motor behind recoveries in the past, is not playing the same role this time. House prices are static or increasing, but the effect of the late 1980s drop is still apparent in many areas. Years of subdued house prices appear to have resulted in a change in attitude. Ms Gina Matthews of the Nationwide estate agency in Southampton believes that homeowners are no longer buying houses for short-term investment gains, but as a place to live for six or seven years. Mr Herman of Anglian Group said: 'Research before the recession showed that within two years of moving to a new home occupants would do most of the major work. Those days are gone. Now people who can't or won't move find that eventually they have to improve their homes.' Companies such as Dimplex, which produces heating units, say they are having to respond to the changed climate by producing more innovative products to persuade cautious consumers to splash out. Housing market activity is picking up. Ms Matthews of Nationwide said: 'Last year we had 20 to 23 viewings before a house sales was agreed. Now it is down to ten to 12 viewings.' In Manchester the price of residential land has risen 25 per cent in the last 12 months, according to chartered surveyors Grimley JR Eve. Mr Robin Brocklehurst of Grimley said he had 'never been as busy in selling residential land. Successful builders are cash rich and haven't carried a land bank for some time'. The improved climate is gradually making business people more confident. Mr John McLellan, regional business appraisal manager at National Westminster Bank, in Southampton said: 'Over the past three months we have sanctioned more new lending limits than for a very long time. However, although we've sanctioned new lending limits, companies haven't yet drawn them down.' But until the crucial trio of jobs, incomes and housing show more spectacular growth, the 'feel good' factor may still be absent. Given Britain's past history of boom and bust, some say that may be no bad thing. 'Perversely, you have to have a slow imperceptible growth in the economy to make it sustainable,' said Manchester Ship Canal's Mr Hough.</p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Boeing falls 45% due to recession BOEING, the world's leading commercial aircraft manufacturer, yesterday reported a 45 per cent drop in third-quarter net earnings as it continued to be hit by recession in the world's civil aviation industry. The company reported earnings of Dollars 189m, or 56 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 5.15bn, down from earnings of Dollars 345m, or Dollars 1.02 a share, on sales of Dollars 6.9bn in the same period of last year. The figures were within the range of analysts expectations but the shares dipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 37 5/8 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Boeing said that based on current programmes and schedules, fourth-quarter sales and earnings would be well above the third quarter, with total sales for 1993 now projected near Dollars 25.5bn. Lower sales would continue next year, reflecting previously announced production cutbacks. Production rate changes were currently being implemented to cut the 737 rate to 10 per month, the 757 to five per month, and the 767 to three per month. In early 1994 the 747 production rate would be cut from five to three per month. 'Economic growth in the major airline traffic markets worldwide continues to be weak, particularly in western Europe and Japan,' it added. 'Consequently, airline profitability, although improving in the aggregate, is expected to remain below historic levels in the near term.' Boeing continued to review future production and 'there is no assurance that rates will be maintained . . . for all models'. However, it added that the start-up of production of the new 777 aircraft in 1995 would provide a 'substantial offset' to sales reductions elsewhere. For the nine months, the company reported net earnings of Dollars 940m, or Dollars 2.77 a share, on sales of Dollars 19.78bn, compared with earnings of Dollars 1.19bn, or Dollars 3.52 a share, in the same period of 1992 on sales of Dollars 22.69bn, excluding adjustments for accounting changes. The company gained new orders for 142 commercial aircraft worth Dollars 9.8bn during the nine months, compared with 158 orders valued at Dollars 11.5bn in the same period of last year. At the end of September its firm backlog stood at Dollars 77.4bn, compared with Dollars 80.8bn at the end of June and Dollars 87.9bn at the end of 1992.</p>

			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGAN KNOWS HOW TO MIX THINGS UP IN THE RECORDING STUDIO  </P> <P> At times, John Archer lives a monkish existence, cloistered from sunlight for  long stretches of time.  </P> <P> The San Diego musician, composer, producer and recording engineer has a  dedication to music that's almost religious, hiding out in studios where he  works the kind of audio magic that brought his band, Checkfield, a Grammy  nomination this year for the album "Through the Lens."  </P> <P> When Archer isn't working in his home studio, he's probably at a larger  professional studio such as Network Music in Rancho Bernardo, where he spent 12  hours on a recent Sunday working on Checkfield's next album with his bandmate  Ron Satterfield.  </P> <P> Two-inch recording tape rolled, stopped and rolled again through the heads of a  24-track recorder. Archer sat behind a giant mixing board, adjusting dials,  directing a violinist on the other side of the soundproof glass.  </P> <P> Though his name is not well-recognized outside San Diego, Archer has become  something of a player, in more ways than one, in the world of contemporary  music.  </P> <P> Since 1982, when he and Satterfield recorded the first Checkfield album,  they've built a national following for their richly textured studio sound,  engineered by Archer. Mixing folk, rock, jazz and high-tech electronics,  Checkfield has become popular enough that "Through the Lens" has sold 50,000  copies.  </P> <P> Archer also gets credit for discovering San Diego keyboard and synthesizer whiz  Spencer Nilsen. He helped Nilsen get a recording contract with Checkfield's  label, American Gramaphone, then produced and engineered Nilsen's debut album,  "Architects of Change."  </P> <P> And he has produced several albums for Network Music, a lucrative "music  library" in Rancho Bernardo that records background tunes used in radio and  television commercials and films. You can hear his work on commercials for  several San Diego businesses, including automobile dealerships and car stereo  stores.  </P> <P> Archer's ability to combine talented musicians and engineer a seamless, upbeat  sound has impressed his Omaha, Neb.-based label, which recently signed him to  produce five albums by other groups.  </P> <P> "John's greatest talent is his ability to put the artist and the project in an  ambiance that's creative," Nilsen said. "Being a talented engineer, producer  and writer/arranger, he's able to see aspects of production a lot of engineers  and producers can't see. He's a great buffer. He can kind of look ahead to the  mixing and mastering process while you're recording and take a lot of steps  out."  </P> <P> Archer is a stickler for details. Several times during the Sunday studio  session he asked violinist Darol Anger to redo a small section of music that to  most other ears would have sounded fine.  </P> <P> "That's a little stylized," he said after Anger played one part a little too  much like Bulgarian folk music.  </P> <P> "We need longer phrases," Satterfield told Anger during another break.  </P> <P> "More legato," Archer explained, using musical terminology for smooth,  drawn-out phrases, as opposed to the violinist's sharper approach.  </P> <P> Archer said his years at Network, which he left recently to concentrate on  Checkfield and producing and engineering for American Gramaphone, provided  fantastic experience.  </P> <P> "Those albums are literally the entire range of Western music, from rock to  16th-Century minuets," Archer said. "They're the most wonderful training ground  a producer could ever have."  </P> <P> Some musicians come to their calling early in life, but Archer, 37, was in his  late teens before he chose to pursue music.  </P> <P> At Wayne State University in Detroit, Archer thought he would become an  engineer -- the number-crunching kind.  </P> <P> But he became bored with engineering classes and, in 1970, loaded his Ford  Mustang with his few possessions and traveled the country for a few months  before he ran out of money in San Diego. Something clicked, and he decided to  be a musician.  </P> <P> "I locked myself in a room for a couple of years and practiced," he said. "I  started as a guitarist. In late 1971 or '72, I began playing local clubs. My  first love has always been finger-style acoustic guitar -- Leo Kottke, John  Renbourne, all of those characters.  </P> <P> "While I was working the clubs, I was taking community college classes, and I'd  switch back and forth between music and electronics."  </P> <P> In the late '70s, the University of California at San Diego was in the  forefront of computerized electronic music, and Archer remembers the state of  technology in the classes he took.  </P> <P> "We'd sit at a terminal and do punch cards, then take them to data processing.  Three days later, at 2 in the morning, out of a little output port would come  my 15-second composition."  </P> <P> Archer and Satterfield met in a music class at Mesa College and soon began  performing together. Satterfield's background as a serious jazz player provides  a good counterpoint to Archer's folk, rock and synthesizer leanings.  </P> <P> "The first incarnation of Checkfield was myself and Ron on acoustic guitars and  singing, with a female vocalist. We were a cross between Manhattan Transfer,  Crosby, Stills and Nash, and Peter, Paul and Mary. We left clubs, shifted to  studio work and became an instrumental act right before we recorded 'Spirit,'  our first national album, in 1982."  </P> <P> Archer changed his last name from Slowiczek to Archer after that album, when  disc jockeys had trouble with the Czechoslovakian name.  </P> <P> "Ron came up with that on an exceedingly drunken night as a combination of the  fact that I like old English Renaissance music and I'm a Sagittarius, an  archer," he said.  </P> <P> The name Checkfield combines the last syllable of Archer's former last name  with the "field" from Satterfield.  </P> <P> Though at times Checkfield's music has been compared to the new age music  recorded by pianist George Winston and others on the Windham Hill label, Archer  doesn't like to label it new age, jazz or anything else.  </P> <P> "Our whole concept is one of writing the material and finding the right vehicle  to express that material," he said.  </P> <P> Archer's good fortune allows him a bit of the good life. He's an avid scuba  diver and within the last year has been to the Grand Cayman Islands, Cabo San  Lucas and the Great Barrier Reef off Australia. Also, being a boy from Detroit,  he drives a late-model Corvette, "the ultimate dream."  </P> <P> But those trappings aren't his fulfillment.  </P> <P> "To be honest, I guess I'm so busy doing the work that I don't pay much  attention (to the money). If there's anything that I would like about  notoriety, it's that more people would hear the music."  </P></p>

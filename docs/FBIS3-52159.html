			<p>Language: <F P=105>English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by A.K. Bhattacharya] </F>   [Text] The latest review of the Indian economy suggests  that the gross domestic product during the current financial  year ending March 1994 will be between four and five percent.  This may not be an achievement worth a celebration. But at the  same time, it is not an easy task either to clock a four or five  percent GDP growth in only the third year of the economic  reforms. The experience of economic reforms all over the world  has shown that there is a sharp decline in growth of GDP in the  first few years after the introduction of structural adjustments  and economic reforms policies. This is because the industry and  other economic agents take their own time to get adjusted to the  new rules of the game. As a result, GDP growth is the first  casualty. The fiscal squeeze, which normally accompany such  reforms and structural adjustment, has also been rather modest,  some critics argue. This will mean that there has been  virtually no fiscal squeeze in 1993-94. The hope now is that  the finance minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, will present a budget  for 1994-95 in February that seeks to reduce the fiscal deficit  to a more manageable level and in consistence with the pursuit  of economic reforms and structural adjustment policies of the  government.    The government's optimism on the GDP growth can also be  explained from the fact that the agricultural sector will once  again do reasonably well during the current year, exceeding the  production levels reached in 1992-93. Monsoons have been good  this year and there has been no slippages in the timely supply  of fertilizers. Even the procurement prices for major crops  during both the commercial rabi [spring] and main kharif  [autumn] seasons were announced well in time, ensuring that  farmers go ahead with their plans for sowing in full knowledge  of the likely returns the crops might fetch in the market.  Since the weightage of agricultural production in the GDP is  quite substantial, any increase in the farm output helps the  economy record a reasonable growth rate even if industrial  production lacks behind the targets.    Such optimism has now been further boosted by the fact that  the industrial sector has at last begun to see some light at the  end of the long tunnel called recession. The depression of  demand witnessed in most consumer durable sectors in this  country for the last two years seems to be over. A large number  of industries, including those in the transportation sector like  the automobiles manufactures, are reporting higher sales. The  six-monthly performance of the most companies operating in the  consumer durable sector have shown a marked improvement in the  sales. Excise duty collections, which is one of the key  indicators of the degree of manufacturing activity in industry,  has also begun picking up.    If all this gets reflected in GDP as they should, there is  no  reason to doubt the government's projection that the GDP growth  this year would cross four percent. There is, however, a need  for striking a note of caution here. A GDP growth of four  percent may be a reasonably satisfactory performance for an  economy in its third year of economic reform, but this is  decidedly far below the potential of an economy of India's size  and resources. As the finance minister has often reiterated in  the past India should look forward to an annual growth rate of  around 10 percent in the next decade and only then can it live  up to the world's expectations of being an uncaged tiger.    Quite clearly, the need for the hour is to get on with the  second phase of economic reforms without any delay. It is an  acknowledged fact that future growth will not come to much from  industry as from the services sector. The potential of the  services sector in this country lies virtually untapped. The  financial sector reforms are now under way. Once the R.N.  Malhotra Committee's report on liberalizing the insurance sector  is accepted by the government, one can hope for further reforms  in this crucial area of the economy also. The financial markets  and the capital market too are gradually getting liberalized.  This should in near future allow the entrepreneurial talent of  the Indian businessmen to exploit the potential availability in  this sector in competition with foreign firms. In the financial  sector also, more new private banks are being set up, stepping  up the pace of economic activities in the economy through a  transparently competitive environment. In the coming years, the  services sector would take a clear lead in terms of the  economy's GDP growth. And, as long as such reforms process  continues unimpaired, there is every reason to achieve a higher  a GDP growth of around 10 percent in the next few years.</p>

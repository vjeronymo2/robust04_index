			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIR, FIRE, WATER AND EARTH  </P> <P> Despite the fact that the feelings of the (Southern California) residents upon  whom malathion was recently sprayed ran the spectrum from not-thrilled to  actively opposed, they were sprayed. A few thousand farmers get their way  regardless of the feelings of millions of city dwellers.  </P> <P> There is another arena in which the balance of power is just as lopsided.  Southern Californians, who consume approximately 17% of the Central Valley  water shipped south, are metered and pay for every cubic foot. Central Valley  farmers, who consume 83%, receive all the water they desire, unmetered. This  year, a drought year, one can still drive through the orchards of the Central  Valley and see farmers spraying their crops at midday, ignoring the simplest  rules of water conservation. Why? Because it is slightly more costly to use  conservation techniques. Farmers will argue that consumer would pay for water  conservation through higher food bills. This is true. But it would be far  cheaper in the long run for everyone if farmers had a financial incentive to  use the existing techniques of water conservation.  </P> <P> It's time we offered a trade to the farmers. We'll allow them to spray the  cities for pests if they allow their water to be metered at a rate that will  encourage water conservation.  </P> <P> DOUG KERR  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

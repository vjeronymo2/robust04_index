			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIFFERENT COURSE;  </P> <P> SHERK WEATHERS STORM AS ONLY WOMAN IN GOLF EVENT  </P> <P> Moments after Cathy Sherk strode off the 18th green at Lookout Point Country  Club here in southern Ontario Friday, a howling rain poured down and a mighty  wind began to blow.  </P> <P> It was as if someone had called upstairs for a display of symbols, after a week  of heavy symbolism. Sherk had been the symbol of women competing against men  and was at the center of a national media barrage, having become the first  woman to qualify and play in a men's professional golf tournament.  </P> <P> And although Sherk, who played for five years on the Ladies Professional Golf  Assn. tour, was cheerily handling the attention, there were certainly dark  clouds hovering over her golf game.  </P> <P> "I wasn't as embarrassed today as I was yesterday," Sherk said Friday, after  finishing with a round of 81 in the $100,000 Ontario Open, playing, of course,  from the men's tees. It might have been nine over par, but it still represented  a tremendous improvement over her 91 of the previous day, a round that included  five double bogeys.  </P> <P> It has been a tough week for Sherk, who lives in Toronto, especially with the  eyes of Canada upon her. Sherk earned the right to play here after shooting a  72 in a qualifying tournament in nearby Port Colborne.  </P> <P> Since then, she has been ballyhooed -- incorrectly -- as the first woman to  play in a PGA-sanctioned event. The Ontario Open is not a PGA event, it is an  event on the Canadian Tour, and it is not specified as a men's event, although  no women had ever played in it.  </P> <P> Sherk, 39, is the first woman to have qualified for an open event, but she is  not the first to play in one. Babe Zaharias played in the 1938 Los Angeles  Open, shooting 84-81 from the men's tees but missing the cut at Griffith Park.  She had been declared a pro after endorsing a line of sporting goods and she  entered the tournament because there was no such thing as a women's pro  tournament then.  </P> <P> Then in 1985, Kathy Whitworth and Mickey Wright played in the Legends  tournament on the Senior PGA Tour.  </P> <P> And in 1986, Tracey Kibsey, a club pro from Winnipeg, became the first woman to  play in a Canadian provincial open. But Kibsey did not have to qualify for the  Manitoba Open because there wasn't a full field that year. She played in the  first two rounds, shooting a 76 and then a 71, missing the cut by a stroke.  </P> <P> Sherk was not that close. Her two-round total of 172 was well above Friday's  149 cutoff.  </P> <P> Her disastrous first day was something from which she could not recover. Was  she nervous?  </P> <P> "Well, I haven't eaten in three days," she said. "I slept last night but I  don't think I've slept for three nights before, either. My stomach has been in  knots. I tell you, I don't know how I teed it up. I don't even remember  yesterday morning."  </P> <P> That may be for the best. This course, about 90 miles southeast of Toronto and  eight miles west of Niagara Falls, is enough to knot anyone's stomach. The  first hole drops 164 feet from tee to green. Several fairways snake through  narrow canyons in what is known geographically as the Niagara Escarpment. A  downhill ski run was once operated alongside the 10th fairway.  </P> <P> "I was humbled by a great golf course," Sherk said after Thursday's round.  </P> <P> Friday's weather made it worse, what with winds gusting to 40 m.p.h. and  intermittent thundershowers.  </P> <P> Sherk took it all with good humor. Tall and husky, she briskly walked the hilly  course, smoking and chatting, while trailed by a ragtag gallery that grew as  the day wore on. Making it more homey was Sherk's 14-year-old son, Chris, who  was her caddy.  </P> <P> Sherk's partners in the threesome -- Jeff Boismier and Brian Hanson -- lent  strong moral support, even while getting overshadowed by a lesser player.  </P> <P> "It helped me to focus," Boismier said. "I really enjoyed playing with Cathy.  She deserved to be here."  </P> <P> Boismier and Hanson had talked to Sherk Friday morning before they teed off and  told her to forget Thursday's round and relax.  </P> <P> "It meant a lot to me," she said. "They have been really supportive."  </P> <P> Sherk might have received some support simply because she's from this area --  she used to be a member at Lookout Point -- and she's not trying to rock the  boat. She said this tournament is special because it's at Lookout Point and  because there was a special ceremony for club professional Gordon McInnis, who  has been her coach for 17 years.  </P> <P> "I was certainly not trying to be smart or make a point by qualifying," she  said. "I talked to a lot of people because I was very nervous about doing this  thing. I didn't know if it was right or what. It was definitely not a women's  lib movement thing at all."  </P> <P> Sherk's reception here is starkly different from what Kibsey got in 1986.  Kibsey, an assistant pro at St. Boniface Golf Club in Winnipeg, said Friday  that she has nothing but bad memories from her experience at barrier-breaking.  </P> <P> "A lot of people were not happy with my entering the event," she said in a  phone interview. "They said they thought I was being a little facetious."  </P> <P> Kibsey said she entered because there were not many options for professional  women golfers in Canada.  </P> <P> Asked if she felt snubbed at the tournament, Kibsey said: "Let's put it this  way. If I hadn't been in the tournament, it would have been OK by them. They  put up with me. No one went out of his way to make me feel welcome."  </P> <P> Sherk wants no part of that action. She has been accommodating with reporters,  and there have been many, but she doesn't care to be singled out.  </P> <P> "I'm not the only person at this tournament," she said. "I wish everyone would  also pay attention to the other guys."  </P> <P> Sherk, who turned pro at 29 after winning the World, Canadian and U.S. amateur  titles, still retains her LPGA card but is non-exempt, which means she must  qualify for each tournament in which she plays. When she was playing regularly,  from 1979 to 1984, her husband and son traveled with her.  </P> <P> "We took Chris with us when he was 4 years old," she said. "We got a trailer  and a truck and off we went to tour the countryside for a year. We found every  zoo and every park from Los Angeles to New York City. It was a great experience  for all of us."  </P> <P> Now, Sherk says, she plays only a few LPGA events a year. By allowing her to  play here, the tournament organizers have used "a liberal interpretation of  what an Open is," said Bob Beauchemin, the commissioner of the Canadian Tour,  which governs both male and female professional golfers in this country.  </P> <P> "There is a loophole there, and each event can put its own conditions on  entry," he said from Toronto. "I have mixed feelings on it. There are a lot of  people interested in Cathy playing and that inadvertently helps expansion of  the game. On the flip side, I cannot imagine a woman playing in the PGA."  </P> <P> Sherk, who has tried to make this clear again and again, has no interest in  playing on a men's tour. She simply wanted to play at this course.  </P> <P> "I didn't have many expectations of doing well in this tournament," she said.  "I knew that if I played lights out, I'd be in at 150. I know these guys are  fantastic. There's no way I had even an expectation of making the cut unless I  just put two rounds together that were just dynamite."  </P> <P> There were no explosions from Sherk here, but, apparently, that's the way she  wanted it.  </P></p>

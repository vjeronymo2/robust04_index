			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Receivers move into property company MONHOUSE, a London-based property company which owns Queens West, one of Cardiff's best-known shopping centres, has gone into administrative receivership. Queens West, which was valued at Pounds 30m when it opened in Cardiff city centre six years ago, has 70,000 sq ft of retail space on three floors and a food theatre with seating for 430 people. The centre's tenants include Laura Ashley, Currys, Burton and Dorothy Perkins, but there are many vacant units. It is continuing to trade normally. Mr Mark Batten and Mr John Soden, of Price Waterhouse, have been appointed joint administrative receivers. Mr Batten said yesterday that although retailing in Cardiff had stood up well in the recession, Queens West had suffered from not having quite as good a location as the rival St David's Centre. He said a number of options were being considered for the centre and, in the meantime, it was business as usual. He added there would be a marketing campaign to attract new shops.</p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Arts: Dreams, demons and a rare talent to disturb - Annalena McAfee talks to Ian McEwan about his first book for children Incest, bestiality, cross-dressing, murder and dismemberment are not the traditional stuff of children's literature. But when novelist Ian McEwan turns his attentions to younger readers, speculation is inevitable. One newspaper has already referred to 'a sex scene' in The Daydreamer, McEwan's new collection of short stories for children. This scene, it transpires, describes a single, imagined, and entirely non-incestuous, kiss. 'You see the problem of my reputation,' says McEwan, whose early preoccupation with extremes of human behaviour once earned him the soubriquet Ian Macabre. 'I suppose it's my own fault,' he says wryly. 'I'm sure The Daydreamer will get poured into the mould somehow.' This reputation as the elegant chronicler of polymorphous perversity has its positive aspect. Since his collection of short stories First Love, Last Rites was published nearly 20 years ago, attracting critical acclaim and revulsion in equal measure, he has consolidated his position as one of Britain's most original and successful writers of fiction - novels and screenplays - and acquired the concomitant trappings, including homes in Oxford and France. The down-side includes incessant requests from Hollywood for scripts about serial killers. 'Their sheep-like imagination angers me. They all want to do the same thing. All the plots involve the systematic wiping out of attractive young women. It's so easy to do on screen.' Hollywood is still a sore point after the debacle over The Good Son, in which his original script about a psychotic child was 'put through the mincing machine' following the interventions of Macaulay Culkin's father. 'It's a terrible film. Don't ever go and see it,' he says, before recalling that it was banned in Britain following the Jamie Bulger murder case. McEwan's decision to embark on his first children's book marks, in a sense, a return to basics. 'I had wanted to write short stories again for some time. This was a way of tricking myself into it.' Although The Daydreamer (Cape Pounds 8.99, 96 pages) is his first work for children, childhood has been a constant theme in his novels, from The Cement Garden, a tender story of forbidden sibling love and unlawful burial, to Black Dogs, an exploration of the conflict between science and soul, in which the orphaned narrator states that looking after children is a way of looking after yourself. The protagonist of The Child in Time, devastated by the abduction of his own child, is a writer who finds that, by some accident, his first novel is humiliatingly categorised as children's literature. McEwan enjoys the irony. 'Yes, he earned so much money with his book that he generated an enormous tax bill which made it inevitable that his second book was for children. I was wondering if I was about to just become a children's book writer. But I think I've escaped that fate by coming to it late.' The Daydreamer represents the fulfilment of a promise to his 11-year old stepdaughter Alice, who had asked him to write some of the stories he had made up for her on holiday. The stories have had a lengthy gestation - Alice is now 22 - and went through several changes and refinements in the re-telling to his other step-daughter Polly, now 24, and his sons William, 11, and Gregory, 8. 'I inscribed Alice's copy saying 'sorry it's late'. She said she was perfectly pleased to have it at any time.' The collection is also a celebration of the imagination, of waking dreams, 'that thing teachers are always telling you off about but is a vital part of everyone's inner noise.' The theme of the book is transformation and exchange and the mood is in turns elegiac, disturbing (though, pace Hollywood, no more so than many favourite fairy tales) and subversively funny. Peter, the central character, swaps places with the family cat; subsequently becomes a baby for a day (featuring cross-dressing, though transgenerational rather than gender); erases his tiresome family limb by limb (dismemberment, albeit bloodless); and is set upon by a pack of disaffected dolls (more dismemberment, pictured right). The language is spare but finely wrought and every story, accompanied by Anthony Browne's delicately menacing black and white illustrations, has the haunting quality of a classic. 'I don't want to sound pompous,' says McEwan. 'But I think it is a crucial part of one's sanity to imagine things other than they are. The ability to imagine yourself as someone else must be at least part of the basis of morality. Behind cruelty must lie a failure of the imagination, of empathy.' The switch of focus from adults was not difficult. 'My impression of conversations with my children is that there is nothing you can't talk to children about, short of VAT and income tax returns. There are clearly disturbing things I wouldn't want to discuss with them, but they would certainly be horribly interested.' He cites the success of Roald Dahl's gleeful misanthropy as evidence of children's fascination with the proscribed and the nasty. 'Everyone else was writing stories encouraging children to have correct attitudes, especially in the Seventies. A lot of children's books were shockingly condescending and didactic - improving books encouraging the right attitudes about gender and race. The attitudes themselves were fine but if novelists want to push values then I think they should write moral tracts.' McEwan also defends the derided Enid Blyton, whose stories enlivened his own childhood, and who incurred the contempt of the orthodox moralists of the Seventies. 'They were all marvellously ridiculous stories. Each summer holiday a gang of kids would disrupt an international conspiracy of villains with dogs, picnics and ginger beer.' Anything that gets children reading, he maintains, is worthwhile. 'When I see my children excited by a book it's a real high: that crossover moment when children don't move their lips when they read and they're seeing something unfolding in their head. Planes could be crashing, heroes could be macheting their way through jungles, but all there is is silence and the sound of turning pages. That's the moment when a child has a private life.' McEwan does not, however, subscribe to the dewy-eyed view that childhood is an Eden from which we are all brutally expelled. In The Daydreamer's final story, Peter, on holiday with his family, has the grim realisation that one day he must leave the group that runs wild on the beach and join the group that simply sits and talks. Overnight he becomes an adult, has that first kiss and, later reverting to boyhood, comes to realise that there are adventures ahead after all. 'I wanted to show that being an adult can be fun too,' says McEwan. VAT, income tax returns and the limited imaginations of Hollywood producers notwithstanding.</p>

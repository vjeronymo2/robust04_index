			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Faysal Malkawi] </F>   [Excerpts] Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the Yemeni  Presidential Council and assistant secretary general of the  Yemeni Socialist Party, has praised the distinguished Jordanian  role aimed at reaching an appropriate formula to implement the  Yemeni accord document which was signed in Amman last February.  [passage omitted]    In an exclusive statement to AL-DUSTUR before leaving Amman  yesterday, Salim Salih Muhammad said: We were informed that a  high-level Jordanian political delegation has been formed and  will be led by al-Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir, chief of the Royal  Court. The delegation is expected to leave for Yemen within the  next few days to meet with the Yemeni leadership within the  framework of the Jordanian role aimed at upgrading political  dialogue. [passage omitted]    Commenting on recent reports that Saudi forces had entered  Yemeni territories in the Sa'dah Governorate, Muhammad said that  this did occur and that joint committees were formed to discuss  bilateral border issues. This is in addition to a message which  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih sent to King Fahd. He noted that  all efforts are focused on solving these border problems as soon  as possible.    On the Iranian role to solve the crisis, Muhammad said: The  Iranian president last week received Yemeni Foreign Minister  Muhammad Basindwah. We consider Iran a fraternal Islamic  country and our relations with it are based on equality, mutual  respect, and joint interests. According to Iranian  confirmations, Iran is not biased toward any party in the Yemeni  crisis. [passage omitted]    The member of the Yemeni Presidential Council explained:  Yemen has a huge amount of weapons. This negates reports that  some Yemeni parties are receiving weapons from outside. In this  regard, he referred to the Yemeni interior minister's statement  the day before yesterday that there are 50 million weapon pieces  in Yemen; that is, four for every person. The member of the  Presidential Council considered this a modest figure compared  with the actual number of weapons in the hands of the Yemeni  people. [passage omitted]</p>

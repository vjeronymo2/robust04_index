			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL COACH HIRED AT OAK PARK  </P> <P> Scott Randles has been hired to run the Oak Park High baseball program, filling  one vacancy created when Ron Veres resigned in September.  </P> <P> Randles, who will turn 30 on Dec. 6, has had limited coaching and playing  experience. He played varsity baseball under Fred Williams at Agoura High in  1974-77, and he coached and played rugby for nine years at the club level.  </P> <P> The vacancy was created when Veres resigned as football and baseball coach  Sept. 6 because of philosophical differences with the administration.  </P> <P> Randles, who was hired as a full-time science teacher this fall, became an  assistant with the junior varsity when Oak Park reshuffled its coaching staff.  </P> <P> Randles said that he developed his coaching philosophy after taking two  physical education classes with Cal Poly Pomona Coach John Scolinos, one of the  winningest active coaches in college baseball.  </P> <P> "I'm not familiar with the players at Oak Park," said Randles, who will hold  his first team meeting today. "I understand we have a young team with only four  varsity lettermen returning. We'll find out (today) who wants to play."  </P> <P> Steve Goldstein, who coached boys' tennis last season, will return to his  position as junior varsity baseball coach. Goldstein also coaches the school's  boys' basketball team.  </P></p>

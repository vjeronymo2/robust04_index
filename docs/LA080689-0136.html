			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Thousands of mourners defied South African police to bury two African National  Congress activists in a funeral that turned violent after more than four hours  of tense confrontation. Police tolerated open defiance of orders forbidding  political statements and banners at the funeral for black student activists  Coline Williams, 22, and Robbie Waterwitch, 20. But the Rev. Richard O'Rourke  said police used dozens of canisters of tear gas to break up the traditional  post-funeral meal attended by about 500 people at St. Matthew's Catholic Church  in Bonteheuvel, a mixed-race area outside Cape Town. Williams and Waterwitch  died July 23 when a bomb they were handling exploded.  </P></p>

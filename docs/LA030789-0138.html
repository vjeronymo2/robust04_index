			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PRODUCTIVITY INCHES UP; LABOR COSTS SOAR  </P> <P> U.S. workers' productivity edged up at a tiny annual rate of 0.1% from October  through December while unit labor costs, a major inflation measure for  business, shot up 5.6%, the government reported today.  </P> <P> The 0.1% rise in non-farm business productivity, output per hour worked,  continued a sawtooth pattern in effect for all of last year with a strong gain  in one quarter followed by a poor showing in the next quarter.  </P> <P> Productivity had risen at an annual rate of 3.4% in the first quarter of 1988  only to fall at a rate of 2.4% in the second quarter. It then rose at a 2% rate  in the July-September quarter only to slow to the minuscule 0.1% advance in the  final three months of the year.  </P> <P> Of particular concern to economists were signs that tight labor markets and  high factory operating rates are beginning to show up in inflationary  pressures.  </P> <P> Unit labor costs, which reflect changes in hourly compensation as well as  changes in productivity, rose at an annual rate of 5.6% in the fourth quarter,  almost double the 3.7% rate of increase in the third quarter.  </P> <P> It was the biggest increase in unit labor costs since a 6.8% rise in the second  quarter last year.  </P> <P> Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan cited the sharp escalation of unit  labor costs as one factor behind the central bank's recent anti-inflation  moves. The Fed is hoping that by pushing up interest rates it will dampen  demand enough to cool an overheated economy and prevent an inflationary  wage-price spiral from taking hold.  </P></p>

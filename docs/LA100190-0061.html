			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: A FREE MARKET OR JUST A TRIP TO THE MARKET?  </P> <P> As Sunday's Berlin Marathon field of 25,000 streamed through the Brandenburg  Gate, into East Berlin and back, some runners toward the rear of the pack  carried German flags, while others were dressed in festive and outrageous  costumes.  </P> <P> The theme of the day was peaceful revolution and unification, but one runner  focused on the wave of consumerism in East Germany's new free-market economy.  He ran the 26.2 miles pushing a grocery cart.  </P> <P> Trivia time: Name the only two major league players to hit 50 or more home runs  in a season in which they struck out at least 100 times.  </P> <P> And Cal razed Arizona: Saturday, Oregon upset Brigham Young, which has Ty  Detmer at quarterback, and Tennessee tied Auburn, coached by Pat Dye. John  Nelson of Associated Press asked: "If 'Ty Died in Eugene,' then why not have  'Dye Tied in Auburn?' "  </P> <P> It is family: For the past month, promotional organizations in Pittsburgh have  been preparing to parlay the National League East title into a public relations  campaign designed to showcase the city as a place to live, work or hold a  convention.  </P> <P> As part of the festivities, travelers arriving at Greater Pittsburgh  International Airport will be met by a robot dressed as a Pirate.  </P> <P> Engulfed in disbelief: Last Tuesday, the San Diego Chargers' public-relations  department got a call from Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> On the line was an American soldier who said he bought 1990 season tickets  before learning he would be shipped out.  </P> <P> Rob Boulware, Charger assistant publicist, said: "I gave him our rushing and  receiving leaders and told him about the quarterback situation and all the  scores."  </P> <P> Boulware said the soldier had one question.  </P> <P> "How did we lose to Dallas?"  </P> <P> Make that five: Reader Dan Jenkins of Pacific Palisades was puzzled after  seeing in last Friday's Morning Briefing that ESPN commentator Bill Robinson  said the Yankees were just four players away from contention -- and that the  players' names were Mickey, Babe, Lou and Yogi.  </P> <P> Asked Jenkins: "Whatever became of Joe?"  </P> <P> It all adds up: Twin Peaksomaniacs, note well: Tonight's opening of ABC's "NFL  Monday Night Football" will feature two characters from the series, FBI Agent  Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) and Sheriff Harry S. Truman (Michael Ontkean).  </P> <P> Two men. Two teams. Bengals and Seahawks. Both men root for the same team.  Which team? No mystery. Think about it.  </P> <P> And while you're at it, think about hype.  </P> <P> Rays of hope: In game 2 of the 1972 American League playoffs, a pitch by  Detroit's Lerrin LaGrow hit Oakland's Bert Campaneris in the ankle. Campaneris  threw his bat at LaGrow.  </P> <P> The incident cleared both benches. Tiger manager Billy Martin had to be  restrained by three umpires. American League president Joe Cronin suspended  Campaneris for the rest of the playoffs and fined him $500. Commissioner Bowie  Kuhn reinstated the A's shortstop for the World Series but suspended him for  the first seven games of 1973.  </P> <P> Last week, Campaneris and LaGrow signed with the Sun City (Ariz.) Rays of the  Senior Baseball League.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Mickey Mantle, with 54 homers and 112 strikeouts in 1961; and  George Foster, with 52 homers and 107 strikeouts in 1977.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Washington Redskin running back Earnest Byner, on the San Francisco  49ers: "Their secret, if that's what you call it, is that they line up and  knock you on your tail."

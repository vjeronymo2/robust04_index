			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: Consob may meet Monday to answer critics CONSOB, Italy's stock markets and companies watchdog, may meet as early as next Monday to respond to criticisms of its role and consider a replacement for one of its five commissioners who is planning to resign. Last night, the agency issued a statement defending its decision not to suspend trading in the shares of the troubled Ferruzzi group. Consob has been attacked for alleged lapses in monitoring Ferruzzi's affairs. Consob's next meeting is expected to discuss a replacement for Mr Roberto Artoni, one of its commissioners, whose plan to resign after little more 18 months has been seen as indicative of a deeper malaise in the agency. The need for a new appointment could give Consob a chance to demonstrate some independence from Italy's political establishment. Consob's chairmen have almost invariably been drawn from the Christian Democrat party. Calls for a full-scale reform of Consob have come from across the political spectrum, with senior spokesmen from both the opposition Party of the Democratic Left (the former Communists) and the autonomist Lombard League demanding changes to make the agency more effective. This week, the chairman and deputy chairman of the finance committee in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house, announced plans to add legislation on giving Consob greater powers to laws currently being considered on making share ownership more attractive.</p>

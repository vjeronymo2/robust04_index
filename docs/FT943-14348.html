			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: More important than matters of life and death  -Political unrest, civil war and economic hardship are simply minor irritations The best way to get applauded on the streets of Haiti is to wear a Brazilian football shirt. Haiti's team are so bad they were kept out of the World Cup by Bermuda, so the whole country supports Brazil. 'You are asking which is more important - Brazil or a US invasion?' one fan asked an American reporter. 'We are hungry every day. We have problems every day. The Americans talk about invading every day. But we only have the World Cup every four years.' During the World Cup, economic sanctions against Haiti have failed to bite and talks between government and opposition were out of the question. At half-time during matches, Haiti's black-and white TV sets show bloody videos of the US invasion of Panama, with texts like No to Intervention superimposed. 'This country is demobilised by the World Cup,' complains Haitian Prime Minister Robert Malval. 'I think when we wake up on July 18 - that's the end of the World Cup party. And that will be the beginning of the end of the party here.' This World Cup is having a bigger effect on countries' politics than any previous World Cup. True, the Argentine junta used the 1978 World Cup much as the Haitian junta is using this one, and West Germany's 1954 triumph did more to restore German self-respect than Konrad Adenauer ever could. Other examples abound. But this World Cup is more serious. For a start, there are more TV sets in the world today than there were even four years ago. The tournament is attracting vast audiences. The average human - a Chinese peasant, Essex Man, Alexandr Solzhenitsyn - will probably have watched six World Cup games by the end of Sunday's final. Rwandans root for Nigeria, Bangladeshis for Maradona (they held protest marches in Dhaka after he was banned for drug-taking), and no doubt the Eskimos have their favourite team. In 1950, famously, Britain learned by telegram that the US had beaten England in Brazil, and even later things were not much better in Africa and Asia. But telegrams do not tend to demobilise nations. Second, in this lone superpower world, the World Cup is the one key arena which the Americans do not dominate. One Mexican soccer-lover living in Boston told me that he would prefer not to see football taking off in the US. The World Cup is the most direct way we have of ranking the nations of the world - it is hard to compare GDPs in a way that is quite as visually appealing - and the Americans' weakness at soccer leaves the field relatively even. Soccer can give a nation status. When we say 'Brazil beat Holland' we feel we are talking not just about their soccer teams but about the countries themselves. 'In the World Cup, all we lost is two games. We didn't lose our national honour,' a Colombian state governor tried to argue a few days ago. He was standing beside the coffin of Andres Escobar, the Colombian player (and own-goal scorer) slain on his return home. Whereas in the past most countries were dictatorships propped up by the US or USSR, now dozens are (or are becoming) democracies. Nicolae Ceaucescu and Todor Zhivkov did not worry about public opinion, and in the 1980s nor did African leaders. Now the Cameroonian president, Paul Biya, is so worried that for two World Cups in a row he has recalled the middle-aged Roger Milla to the team (what will he do in 1998, when Milla is 46?). Ethnic tension rises, and rulers look to the World Cup to foster unity. General Sani Abacha likes the Nigerian team to include players from each of the country's three main tribes, and after Romania beat Argentina, President Ion Iliescu said the ethnically diverse team had created a 'national consensus.' (That was before the ethnic Serb Belodedici missed the decisive penalty in the quarter-final). The US squad, which contains Hispanics, blacks, Italian- and Greek-Americans  -precious few Wasps - received a call from President Clinton that was shown on prime-time TV. Democratic rulers everywhere are struggling, and they all turn to the World Cup. In Italy, where soccer is perhaps the least tarnished national institution of the moment, Silvio Berlusconi got himself elected prime minister with a party named after a football chant. In Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, presidents have appeared on TV during the World Cup to suggest changes to the national team's line-up. Even in Norway, Prime Minister Gro Brundtland appeared on a TV panel commenting on the country's opening game. Countries that need the World Cup most were only admitted to it quite recently. Fifa, soccer's governing body, first gave Africa a World Cup berth in 1970; only this year did the continent get three places. Asia, with more than half the world's population, for long had only one spot, and still has only two. And the poor are improving. African teams regularly reach the second round. The Third World cares: when Egypt drew with Holland in 1990, soldiers of all factions in Beirut spent the night firing into the air. When England beat Cameroon a couple of weeks later, a Bangladeshi man had a heart attack and a Bangladeshi woman killed herself. 'The elimination of Cameroon also means the end of my life,' read her suicide note. Americans are trying hard to understand. 'When Brazil lost in 1990 people were jumping off buildings,' said US star striker Eric Wynalda. 'I don't think anyone jumped off a building when Buffalo lost the Superbowl.'</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Bleak summer for the ERM HISTORY must judge whether the Bundesbank's actions of the past few years will eventually confirm, or undermine, its economic reputation as Europe's most accomplished central bank. For the moment, the only conclusion that can be drawn from its baffling behaviour of the past few days is that the Bundesbank's public relations skills are woefully lacking. Its decision to allow Europe's highly-strung foreign exchange markets to infer that a discount rate cut was imminent and then leave the rate unchanged appears, at best, incompetent. The Bundesbank has achieved one thing for which it should not be criticised: no one can now accuse the bank of putting the preservation of the European exchange rate mechanism before its prime task of achieving medium-term stability. Whether German interests do, indeed, militate against a further cut in short-term rates appears highly questionable. The suspicion remains that, after a sharp recession and when the yield curve is inverted, the bank's determination to set policy by contemporaneous inflation and monetary indicators may prove a serious mistake. But the Bundesbank can and should be criticised for a series of actions which have served to feed the frenetic instability in Europe's money markets. Why, if the Bundesbank did not intend to cut the discount rate yesterday, did it unexpectedly reduce the highly sensitive repo rate the day before? And why has it felt no obligation publicly to explain its actions? One answer may be that a full explanation is too unpalatable for its council members to express. For Germany is no longer the strong and stable low inflation country that it once was. This fact is at the root of the current difficulties. Fixed exchange rate systems work well when all the members of the zone are affected similarly by the same economic problems. They perform less well when some countries have special economic problems which require a different policy mix: that is why the UK and Italy were forced to leave the ERM last autumn, and why Spain is now under such pressure. But fixed systems perform disastrously when the anchor currency also joins the problem category. The ERM's difficulties stem from the fact that Germany has structural budget problems and an inflation rate currently more than twice as high as that of France and Belgium and four times that of Denmark. For Germany, that will continue to mean high short-term interest rates. For its low inflation partners, it means ever higher real interest rates. The result is the unnecessarily deep recessions they are now suffering. An ERM re-alignment would offer no realistic prospect of relief. While Germany remains the ERM anchor, it will continue to set the interest rates floor and the markets will continue to bet on whether the low inflation countries will be forced to breach it. A better solution might be for Germany to recognise that it - not France or Denmark - is the country with structural problems and so needs, temporarily, to leave the ERM. The only other option for these low inflation countries is to try to sweat the summer out. That means continuing to lose foreign exchange reserves while trusting the Bundesbank to intervene and the big speculative players to stay away. They may yet succeed. But at what price?</p>

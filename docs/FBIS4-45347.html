Galvan and M. Cabrera] </F>   [Excerpts] Tijuana, Baja California, 10 May--The Attorney  General's Office [PGR] requested 30 warrants for the arrest and  appearance of ex-officials and ex-agents of the State Attorney's  Office, and has already implemented some of them. They are  associated with the cases of the shootout at the Christine  discotheque in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, the confrontation here  on 3 March between federal agents and "narcos," and the presumed  link between State Judicial Police [PJE] members and the drug  Mafia.    Today, the ex-state attorney, Juan Francisco Franco Rios,  appeared at the PGR headquarters to make his statement. He was  interrogated for 15 hours regarding the matter of the  credentials carried by bodyguards of the Arellano Felix family  drug traffickers at the Christine discotheque.    Franco Rios and Alvarez Barriere denied that there was a  "massive flight" of ex-PJE members, claiming that all the group  chiefs replaced yesterday still remain in town.    Furthermore, the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office took  penal action against the Federal Judicial Police [PJF] agent,  Gabriel Anzures Carpeta, as a person presumed guilty of crimes  against the administration of justice and of theft, during his  participation in the arrest of the Baja California deputy  attorney general, Sergio Ortiz Lara.    Meanwhile, 100 Federal Judicial Police agents arrived in  Ciudad Juarez searching for the Tamaulipas drug trafficking  "capo," Juan Garcia Abrego, and the brothers Benjamin, Ramon,  and Francisco Javier Arellano Felix, Sinaloan drug dealers  involved in the death of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo.  This announcement was made by the force's general director,  Adrian Carrera Fuentes.  <H5>  Thirty Arrest Warrants </H5>   After making his statement during a 12-hour period, the  ex-commander of the PJE's second sector in this town, Jorge  Alvarez Barriere, who admitted having been queried about the  incidents of 3 March, remarked that the PGR had issued 30  warrants for arrest and appearance.    He confirmed the existence of case record 3455, in  connection  with which the federal department opened an investigation of  state agents' participation in the drug traffic.    During his appearance before the PGR, Alvarez Barriere also  explained that, at the time of the confrontation in Puerto  Vallarta, he was not yet an agent of the force in Tijuana, and  hence had no connection with the incident.    He also denied having been dismissed from his position,  claiming that the one currently heading the force has merely  made a substitution. [passage omitted]    As for the case involving the state's ex-attorney general,  Juan Francisco Franco Rios, his defense attorney, Juan Belmonte  Stringel, explained that he had been interrogated for a period  of 15 hours regarding the credentials being carried by  bodyguards of the drug trafficker, Arellano Felix, during the  incidents that occurred at the Christine discotheque in Puerto  Vallarta, Jalisco.    He added that his client, who remained at the department's  facilities from 1800 yesterday until 0800 today, had submitted  evidence showing that the identity documents in the drug  traffickers' possession were false, and that his signature had  been altered.    After the questioning, Belmonte Stringel declared that the  ex-official, who appeared with an amparo to make statements at  the PGR facilities, is by no means linked with the drug traffic  or the shooting that occurred on 3 March in this town. [passage  omitted]    Moreover, in a communique, the PGR stated that, based on the  activities cited in preliminary investigation 1142/94, the  Federal Public Prosecutor's Office found Gabriel Anzures  Carpeta, a PJF member, presumably guilty of crimes against the  administration of justice and theft.    It should be recalled that, when the deputy attorney  general,  Sergio Ortiz Lara, was arrested, he was put into a green 1993  Jeep Cherokee without license plates, which had been reported as  stolen, and driven by the presumed criminal.    The vehicle was detected after the U.S. consul in Tijuana,  Edwin Cubbisson, gave the department a list of 25 vehicles  stolen in California, including that one, as well as another of  the same type, a 1989 model.    The PGR spokesman, Jesus Velasco, announced that, to date,  five persons have made statements in connection with that  preliminary investigation, which was turned over to the sixth  district judge of criminal proceedings in Baja California.    He stressed that the probes will continue, to determine  whether there are other public officials involved in this  illicit activity.  <H5>  One Hundred PJF Forces in Juarez </H5>   The PJF general director in Ciudad Juarez, Adrian Carrera  Fuentes, announced that 100 agents from this corps arrived today  on a search for the Tamaulipas drug trafficking "capo," Juan  Garcia Abrego, and the brothers Benjamin, Ramon, and Francisco  Javier Arellano Felix, Sinaloan drug traffickers implicated in  the death of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo.    The agents arrived on a special plane and on the "guajolota"  [turkey], (a DC-6 used by the Attorney General's Office to  transport prisoners classified as dangerous). They were headed  by Carrera Fuentes and the operations coordinator, Jose Luis  Patino, who were lodged in two hotels.    During the operation, initiated in Ciudad Juarez, residences  in the Campestre Juarez, Country Racquet, and San Marcos  subdivisions were searched, as well as some rooms in hotels and  even on farms located in the Casas Grandes area of the state's  northwestern section.    Carrera Fuentes explained that, based on the information  held  by the PGR, a simultaneous operation is being conducted in this  town and Tijuana, "the worst trouble spots in the passage of  drugs to the United States."    He noted that probes are being made, ranging from bank  accounts to operations carried out by the Arellano Felix  brothers on this border.    Carrera Fuentes claimed that the drug cartel chief in  Tamaulipas, Juan Garcia Abrego, was on this border a few days  ago. "We are following their trail closely, and expect to  capture the Arellano Felix brothers at any moment." [passage  omitted]</p>

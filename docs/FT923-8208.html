			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bulgarian mines flounder in market economy - Domestic shipments have fallen by 60% over the past two years THE MOVE to democracy and a market economy in Bulgaria has decimated the traditional industries of the Balkan country, leaving its metals industry in crisis. Although the Union of Democratic Forces became the largest single political party in the National Assembly elections in October last year, it failed to win overall majority. This has led to the Bulgarian Socialist Party - the repackaged communist party - blocking reforms in alliance with smaller parties, generally making the transition to capitalism that much more painful. The impact of this on the country's primary metals companies and manufacturers of semi-fabricating products has been dramatic. Domestic shipments have fallen by 60 per cent over the past two years as the construction, electronics and machine building industries of Bulgaria have floundered in the new free market conditions. In many cases home market sales now account for only 20 per cent of output. Gone are the assured trading partners of Comecon Europe, led by the former Soviet Union, and Bulgaria has been forced to join the rest of the world in its bid to sell increasingly sophisticated products in highly competitive international markets. But the most remarkable thing about the Bulgarian metals industry is that it is surviving in the face of lack of investment; a western world recession; and the enormous effort involved in trying to capture new markets. Like the lead and zinc smelters and copper semi-fabricating producers in Bulgaria, the country's sole primary copper producer MDK at Pirdop, which used to depend on state support to cover its regular losses, is operating at a profit, according to Mr Dimitre Andreev Petrov, deputy director in charge of production and development. Previously known as Georgi Damanyov, after a former and now discredited communist prime minister, the plant is forced to operate at less than half the 170,000-tonnes-a-year potential of its Outokumpu flash furnace because of lack of investment. About 25,000 tonnes of refined copper is produced annually for the domestic market and a further 25,000 tonnes for export, with some produced on a toll smelting contract basis, for, among others, Marc Rich, the international trading company based in Zug, Switzerland. However, as MDK has yet to obtain London Metal Exchange listing for its copper cathodes it is finding it hard to meet the specifications of many western consumers. Even the domestic semi-fabricator Energocabel in Sofia restricts its intake from MDK to 25 per cent, preferring western cathode. Mr Petrov, like many of his compatriots, is looking for foreign finance for investment. He said: 'We are now making investigations to this effect. Certain companies which have an interest in enlarging our copper production are helping us with preliminary investigations. In three to four months we hope to have a solution'. Unfortunately the country's precarious political situation, coupled with crippling corporate taxation - set at 52 per cent but rising to over 80 per cent when hidden levies are included - provides little encouragement for investors. And the government's ambitious privatisation programme is unlikely to have any more success in attracting foreign finance. It will be at least early 1993 before the first Bulgarian state companies come under the hammer. 'The metals industry will see no incentives this year,' Mr Pirin Tzenkov, general director of the Ministry of Trade, said. Answering criticism levelled by the industry that sluggish reforms were hindering investment, he admitted that they were moving too slowly. 'The crisis in the metals industry is very strong,' he said, 'but the financial situation needs to be sorted out before measures like reduced taxation can be implemented.' Mr Tzenkov was also pessimistic about the privatisation of the metals industry, whose expensive plants will need huge investment with little promise of early returns. 'Our banks are a good example of this. Some individual banks have issued shares and, though they operated at a profit, no dividends were released,' he explained. 'The same could happen at these large plants.' But foreign investment is not ruled out altogether. There are ways round Bulgarian law. For example, the Council of Ministers can remove taxes from large companies for limited periods. At the same time, certain legislation allows foreign companies to pay taxes in the country most favourable to them  -ie, their own. Meanwhile, without exception the metals companies of Bulgaria are following LME prices and in some cases delivering metal on to the exchange. They are selling direct to end users and using independent traders, thus reducing their dependence on state import-export companies like Rudmetal. Reducing staff levels has been a common policy throughout the Bulgarian metals industry, unless sensitive social factors make this impractical. For example, the KCM lead and zinc plant in the industrial heartland of Plovdiv has kept on its 2,250 staff as many other companies in the area have closed or face bankruptcy. The unemployment level is already at 25 per cent. At the moment KCM is negotiating a one-year contract with two labour unions. But with the average salary at L3,600 (Pounds 85) a month, more than twice the national average, strike action is unlikely. Mr Tzenkov spoke of the problems of balancing conflicting social issues in the area. 'First of all there was a movement to close the Plovdiv plant due to ecological reasons and then there was a movement to reopen it due to the unemployment problem,' he said. Green lobbyists, increasingly active in the country, were evidently mollified by a compromise situation. The plant shut down its lead production from January-March this year, during which it installed new purifying equipment. According to Mr Nicola Dobrev, KCM's managing director, this has brought the plant's emissions in line with Bulgaria's national standards. Nevertheless, the company's lead output has been restricted to 32,000 tonnes a year, compared with a potential 40,000-50,000 tonnes. Zinc production is also expected to be lower than the 60,000 tonnes capacity this year, at 50,000 tonnes. This is largely due to reconstruction and repairs to the plant. The other lead and zinc producer in the country, the Lead - Zink complex in Kardjali, planning to build a new 50,000-tonnes-a-year zinc smelter at its existing site with unnamed US partners. Mr Russi Dafinov, the general manager, said that Bulgarian government approval was expected and building should start next year. It would be a further three years before the plant was commissioned and it would replace the existing 27,000-tonnes-a-year plant. Its lead output has also been reduced to 20,000 tonnes a year from 42,000 tonnes, because of environmental concerns. Alongside the industry's emphasis on exports, with markets primarily in the Far and Middle East and neighbouring countries, imports of raw materials are taking on increasing importance. Niproruda, the Bulgarian state-owned mining, research and technology company, is currently assessing the future viability of the country's mining and metals sector. According to deputy director Ivan Daskalov, some 50-60 per cent of the country's mines and concentrators are unprofitable. Ore grades have fallen significantly after years of exploitation. So much so that the Bulgarian Council of Ministers announced last month that 56 mines would be closed in the next few years. The announcement triggered an immediate strike threat by the country's two main unions, who demanded the publication of the mine rehabilitation decree in the State Gazette. The government, already facing a crisis of confidence and possible collapse by September, quickly acquiesced, publishing the decree on July 28. Included are the Burgas Copper Mines, with six sites to be closed from 1992-94. Also copper mines belonging to Asarel Medet, Eliseina and Ustrem are to go, as well as 20 lead and zinc mines under the control of Gorubso and the Madjarovo and Osogovo non-ferrous mines. Whether the Bulgarian metals industry will be able to meet the overwhelming challenges of finding new trading partners and sources of raw material, coupled with the replacement of ageing plant and technology, remains to be seen. The country has, as yet, the advantages of cheap labour and fixed-price power, as well as a relatively good position logistically. But as Mr Tzenkov said: 'It is difficult to envisage what the industry will look like in ten years' time.' Karen Taylor is a deputy editor (non-ferrous) of Metal Bulletin magazine.</p>

			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SPOTLIGHT / A GLANCE AT THIS WEEK IN THE NFL;  </P> <P> SMALL VICTORY  </P> <P> Detroit's 27-10 victory over New Orleans was the Saints' third loss to a  run-and-shoot offense in four weeks.  </P> <P> The Saints, ranked eighth in the NFC in team defense, lost to Houston, 23-10,  last week and to Atlanta, 28-27, three weeks ago.  </P> <P> Reaching for a positive note, the Saints can offer only defensive end Jim  Wilks, who registered their first sack of a run-and-shoot quarterback this  season when he got to Rodney Peete in the first quarter.  </P> <P> Peete, however, was only momentarily grounded. The former USC quarterback got  up and completed 16 of 24 passes for 246 yards, including a five-yard touchdown  pass to Robert Clark.  </P></p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Technology: World's smallest instant camera - Worth Watching The world's smallest instant camera is how Polaroid describes Vision, a folding camera with a window on the back through which the photographer can see the developing picture. Polaroid has shrunk the camera by incorporating the functions carried out by seven chips into a single micro-controller. The in-built flash emits a brief range-finding beam as the shutter release is pressed, to determine the distance of the object while the micro-controller calculates the best exposure from information on ambient and infra-red light. The picture size has also shrunk. The cost of each photo is Pounds 1. Polaroid: UK, 0727 859191.</p>

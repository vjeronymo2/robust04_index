			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Survey of Computers and Communications (9): Livening up the picture - Olivetti transfers the videophone from science-fiction to reality THE operators of two personal computers will exchange data between Pisa and London today. The information will be flashed across Europe using Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) telecoms standards. There's nothing unusual about that. What merits a public demonstration at Wembley's Interactive Multi-Media Event is that video cameras fixed to each monitor will transmit a live video image of either user. The picture forms one frame of a split screen using windowing software. Other windows will contain still images that can be modified by one party as the other looks on. A telephone handset completes the communications package. The Personal Communication Computer (PCC) is the result of collaboration between British Telecom and Olivetti multi-media research labs in Pisa. It marks the transition of the videophone from science-fiction gimmick to working tool, and owes its existence to the maturing of international communications standards. Mr Chris Hart is a BT manager for architecture, technology and standards. He has watched video communications struggle after a false start. 'The original BT video experiments were in the '70s, but what came out of them was teletext. BT had a belief in video telephony then and it bombed.' Transmitting a moving image digitally was the problem. That was before ISDN arrived to support the speed of transmission and provide an internationally agreed standard to carry the data. ISDN has been fuelled by the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) initiative towards open standards in computer communications. Without a widespread data standard the PCC would be an expensive laboratory toy. A communications computer that would only talk to machines from the one supplier would not appeal to any sensible user. With commonly defined standards, BT can launch PCC products with any other computer maker it choses. An alliance with IBM is already in the works. The PCC only began to make sense with market acceptance of multi-media, the technology that ties video, audio text and graphics together in one PC package. Olivetti used off the shelf products (the video camera is from Panasonic or Sony) and married them to the PCC. The product owes its existence to these underpinning technologies. Not every business application cries out for live video links. Foreign exchange dealers do not require their trading partner to witness the chaos of a dealing room. And because ISDN signals still travel over copper wires, the video rate is slowed down to 10 frames a second, around a third of TV transfer rates. The result is a slightly jerky picture. But EC-funded work carried out as part of the Research into Advanced Communications in Europe (Race) project suggests live video links are more than an elaborate gimmick. Prototype PCCs became popular with staff at Allied Irish Bank. The ability to communicate with a live member of staff is the next step in the use of multi-media in retailing. Interactive systems using video disks are currently used to sell financial services. But they are limited to answering whatever queries the help-screen has been pre-programmed for. Sooner or later human intervention is required. One expert at one location can service several retail outlets via a network of PCCs. With enhanced versions on the way, Olivetti is proposing to rent out a pair of PCCs for Pounds 2,000 a month, with imminent upgrades thrown in. Used imaginatively the ability to redesign plans and documents on-screen over great distances could offer significant cost benefits. And the advance of open computer communications has already been seized on as a force multiplier by the retail banking industry. Olivetti will deliver 1,000 network controllers to National Westminster Bank this year. The bank is spending Pounds 20m in the current year to get a comprehensive dedicated computer communications systems up and running. These controllers are powerful workstations known as file servers that will run NatWest retail banking applications in each branch and summon personal account data via the bank's network. The X25 OSI protocol is the key to NatWest's plans. Building a network around the open systems model permits chopping and changing suppliers at will, provided they meet OSI criteria. Olivetti is prime contractor on the project. It integrates software from the bank and third parties and ensures that the resulting system will run happily across a wide area network. This contract comes as recognition of its status in the open systems world. But that achievement also contains a threat. NatWest is buying in Olivetti expertise in creating a broad-ranging network that will be open to other sources of technology. Doing the job properly and within cost is the only guarantee Olivetti has of being asked back to participate next year. Olivetti was an early and enthusiastic participant in the business of open communications. Historically it had never invested in its own proprietary protocol. The pay-off comes with contracts such as the NatWest deal. But dedication to OSI has its drawbacks. Older, non-open standards still enjoy a massive user base, especially in the US. 'We were first in when the OSI ball started rolling, but the market hasn't embraced OSI to the extent planned and Olivetti has invested a huge resource in it.' Mr Chris Wilson is group communications manager at Olivetti in the UK. He is well aware that a religious adherence to OSI can earn little recognition. 'Most OSI work we sell is embedded under other products,' he says. A majority of UK building societies now rely on OSI networking products from Olivetti. But the company's crucial code-writing skills have a low visibility. As customers exert greater pressure on costs, Olivetti will have to fight to justify prices that reflect a great investment in baseline communications technology. If the PCC is popular BT will have Olivetti's rivals queueing up to adapt their business computers to the world of video links. Getting in first has obvious advantages, but staying ahead of the pack could be tougher than acquiring an open communications capability in the first place.</p>

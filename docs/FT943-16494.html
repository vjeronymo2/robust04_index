			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo Japanese government bonds have failed to react to the appreciation of the yen, which is usually seen as a support factor for the market since a stronger currency depresses imported inflation. Instead, investors have focused on a possible increase in supply due to the fiscally expansive stance of the new Murayama administration. The new government has made clear it will continue to cut income taxes, while postponing the consumption tax increase, lobbied by the powerful Ministry of Finance. The government, however, is running Y2,000bn behind its minimum financing requirement for the current business year, indicating the downward pressure on prices will increase later in the year. Market participants this week will be looking at the quarterly Bank of Japan's branch manager's meeting, and possible easing of monetary policy in reaction to the yen's record highs. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, has been calling for a co-ordinated interest rate move - cuts in the official discount rate by Germany and Japan, and a rise in US interest rates - to stop the dollar's decline. However, while short-term money market rates may respond to such a move, bond prices are expected to remain depressed as investors remain cautious over the possible pressures of extra supply.</p>

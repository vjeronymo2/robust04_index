			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pasi Tuohimaa: ``Drinking Water for Hundreds of </F> Thousands of Finns Doesn't Fulfill EEA Requirements'']    [Text] Stricter rules become effective at the end of the  year. Removal of excess manganese and iron costs 2 billion  markkas.    It is estimated that the drinking water used by hundreds of  thousands of Finns will not be within legal limits at the  beginning of next year, when new restriction become effective in  connection with the EEA [European Economic Area] treaty. In the  near future, 100 to 200 groundwater utility companies and about  30 surface water utility companies will have to take measures  concerning excess levels of iron and manganese.    Small water intake plants, which are located in groundwater  areas with high iron levels, will face the toughest challenge.  The water cleaning bill will, relatively speaking, be the  highest for them. At the same time, pressure to increase water  rates will grow.  <H5>  Majority Does Not Fulfill Manganese Requirements </H5>   A work group appointed by the National Board of Waters and  Environment estimated that, by the year 2000, Finland must  invest 2 billion markkas in order to bring all of the country's  drinking water up to EC standards.    The new drinking water regulations apply to all water  supplies with over 50 users. The most urgent repairs must be  performed at water companies servicing over 5,000 people, as  they must immediately file reports with the EU [European Union].  Today, almost half of the large water utility companies exceed  the accepted limits.    The current target manganese level is 0.1 mg per liter,  while  the EU directive specifies less than .05 mg per liter. Water  quality requirements, thus, become much more stringent.    Based on information from 1987, there are 60 water utility  companies in Finland that currently are unable to reach the  figures required by the directive, not even by considering  annual averages. If we use as a frame of reference, as  stipulated in the directive, the highest measured  concentrations, most water utility companies in Finland are  unable to satisfy the requirements.    The current iron target concentration of 0.2 mg per liter  will become a requirement. Based on 1987 information, the  average iron concentration of water treated and sent out for  distribution exceeds the target value at approximately 50 water  companies. When tap water is tested, 140 companies exceed the  limit.    The majority of these water utility companies are located in  the provinces of Turku, Pori, Vaasa, and Oulu.    The iron problem is not felt that much by water utility  companies in larger cities, which use surface water.    Based on the latest information, the only ones not affected  by the more stringent water policies of health authorities are  households using well water. It would be a significant problem  in Finland to monitor every well, as there are about a million  wells that are used by individual households. According to a  study that was completed in the summer, of these, about 750,000  yield water of poor quality.  <H5>  Directive Also To Apply to Dairies </H5>   However, the new regulations would apply to all water that  is  used in the industrial production of foodstuffs. A conservative  interpretation of these rules would suggest that dairy farms, at  least, would have to bring up their water supply to EC levels.    In reality, it is not possible to take care of all problems  immediately, even if required by law. According to Senior  Engineer Leena Hiisvirta of the Ministry of Social Affairs and  Health there will be no transfer periods; the new regulations  will become effective immediately.    However, the ministry can grant special dispensation to  water  intake plants whose water values exceed the permissible limits,  on a case-by-case basis. Depending on the design of the  necessary cleaning facility, the dispensation may be granted for  anywhere from a few months to a few years.    But the authorities are still not intending to get too rough  on the water utilities. Hiisvirta, who participated in the  negotiations in Brussels last September, said that the new  regulations will not be printed and distributed to district  health and water authorities until February.  <H5>  Same Problems in All Countries </H5>   Hiisvirta pacifies those who fear disciplinary measures by  the EU Commission.    ``All European nations have experienced the same kind of  problems. The problems with the Commission are ironed out. The  citizens' worrying is the largest problem. We do not follow the  letter of the law anymore as we are used to, and the Finnish  water supply is not as good as we had thought, after all,'' she  said.    ``If a water intake plant has not been granted dispensation,  it is obligated to pay compensatory damages for, for example,  damages caused by too high concentrations of iron,'' added  Hiisivirta.    The current quality requirements for water used by  households  in Finland were issued in 1990. According to Environmental  Director Pekka Jalkanen with the Finnish Federation of  Municipalities, even at that time, close attention was paid to  permissible concentrations according to the current EC directive.    ``The most significant change is that earlier quality  targets  or recommendations are now changing to quality requirements or  regulations,'' he said.    The EU Commission does not differentiate between water  health  hazards and other quality requirements that, until now, have  been the policy in Finland.</p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Shake-up in policy team for Europe The Clinton administration is to undertake a further shake-up of its foreign affairs team, with a complete reshuffle of personnel in charge of European policy. Mr Richard Holbrooke, a senior diplomat in the Carter administration and now the US ambassador to Germany, will be recalled to replace Mr Stephen Oxman, the assistant secretary of state for European and Canadian affairs. This is likely to be seen as one more old Washington hand taking the place of another friend of President Bill Clinton, because Mr Oxman attended Yale law school with the president. Also, Mr Alexander Vershbow, Mr Oxman's deputy, will move to the White House to take over from Ms Jenonne Walker as head of European affairs at the National Security Council. The positions are central to the formulation of the US administration's policy on Bosnia, among other issues. Ms Walker is to become ambassador to the Czech Republic, and Mr Oxman is also expected to be offered an embassy.</p>

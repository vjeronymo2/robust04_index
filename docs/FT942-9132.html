			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: South Africa Gold shares finished generally lower as they succumbed late in the day to a bullion price dip, and other shares tended to soften as an expected pick-up in foreign demand failed to materialise. The overall index ended 36 down at 5,497, industrials slipped 3 to 6,707 and golds were 39 lower at 1,856. De Beers dipped R1.50 to R109.25, Anglos shed R2.25 to R232.75 and JCI lost R2.50 at R92.50. Financial shares reflected slower interest after recent gains, Firstbank receding R1 to R113.</p>

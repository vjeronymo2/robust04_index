			<p>BFN       The following is a roundup of recent environmental reports  monitored from media in FBIS Abidjan Bureau and EAU coverage  areas from 22 April to 2 May.  <H5>  GHANA </H5>   Accra Ghana Broadcasting Corporation (GBC) Radio Network in  English at 0600 GMT on 25 April reports that in order to check  overdepletion of fish resources, the government has placed a ban  on the importation of trawlers into the country. The radio says  that the Ministy of Food and Agriculture is also taking steps to  ensure that the ban on the use of undersized nets, dynamite  sticks, and the fishing practice popularly called atidsa, where  tree branches are place in water to serve as shelter for fish,  is strictly enforced. According to the GBC, the deputy minister  of food and agriculture in charge of fisheries announced this  during a tour of some fishing communities in the Volta Region.  A correspondent quotes the minister as telling the fishermen  that the government is greatly worried about the high depletion  rate of fish resources and is taking steps to check the  situation.    Accra Ghana Broadcasting Radio Network in English at 0600  GMT  on 28 April states that delegates from five African countries  are meeting at Aburi to work out a system of supporting  environmental education initiatives in the subregion. The  delegates are from Ghana, the Gambia, Nigeria, Sierra leone, and  Kenya. A correspondent report states that the course is being  organized by the University of Bradford in the United Kingdom  and the May Day Rural Project, a nongovernmental organization  supported by the Overseas Administration of Britain. This is a  follow-up to similar seminars in Ghana and the United Kingdom  where participants call for more training schemes to enhance  dissemination of environmental education. The course aims to  acquaint participants with the definition and historical  evolution of environmental education by discussing the education  strategy for Ghana and planning mechanisms to support the  implementation of environmental initiatives in the subregion.  <H5>  NIGER </H5>   Niamey Voix du Sahel Network in French at 1200 GMT on 22  April reports that in several areas of Filingue District there  are large numbers of plants like acacia, albida, or gao, in the  southeast which are being threatened by farmers and herdsmen.  Most of the 30,000 inhabitants in the area are pastoralists and  during the past agricultural season, a significant amount of  grazing ground was used. This has created a phenomenon of  environmental deterioration. The animal breeders have used trees  to feed animals. According to an environmental officer, this  phenomenon is growing and if this practice continues there will  be no environmental regeneration. The environment department is  finding it difficult to find alternatives for the animal  breeders, but until they do there is a need to alert the farmers  and herdsmen to the importance of natural regeneration for the  environment.    Paris AFP in French at 1120 GMT on 1 May reports ecologists  in Niger have sounded the alarm about increasing usage of the  plastic packings which pollute the country's main cities and  have begun to threaten the health of human beings and livestock.  On 23 April, Ecologica, an nongovernmental organization,  launched a campaign called Plastic Packing-Free Environment  Operation. Ecologica promised to supply schools with teaching  equipment in exchange for the nonbiodegradable wastes they would  collect. Ecologica has also called on beggars in urban centers  to participate in the collection of plastic packings for  recycling.    The Ministry of Environment has admitted the severity of the  problem, while confessing its inability to face it. According  to highway services, plastic packings now account for half of  household waste in the cities. In Niamey, the City Council put  in place trash cans exclusively for plastic packing waste, but  since the cans are poorly protected they are emptied by the  first gust of wind.    Sheep, goats, oxen, and asses wandering in the streets  sometimes feed on this plastic waste. The veterinary clinic in  Niamey says that in one month 30 animals suffered indigestion  due to plastic packings. Human beings are also in danger since  some people think that they can use the plastic waste as source  of energy and inhale highly toxic substances.  <H5>  NIGERIA </H5>   Lagos Radio Nigeria Network in English at 0600 GMT on 28  April reports the administrator of Adamawa State, Group Captain  Gabriel Agbonene, has expressed concern over the problem of  desertification. He was speaking in Lola when students of the  Administrative Staff College of Nigeria, ASCON, called on him.  Capt. Agbonene also highlighted some natural hazards which, he  said, had affected the state. They include the (Logdo) Dam  which neighboring Cameroon usually opens with devastating  effects on lives and property.    Earlier, the leader of the delegation, Mr. Adeyemi Yekini,  said they were in the state to study the environmental problem  with a view to recommending to the Federal Government how best  to solve it.    Lagos Radio Nigeria Network in English 1500 GMT 25 Apr 94  reports that the Anambra State Government will undertake an  experiment aimed at reducing the menace of soil erosion on some  selected roads in various parts of the state. The state  administrator disclosed this while exchanging views with  representatives of a construction company at Government House.  He told them his administration would welcome cost-effective  ideas in dealing with the problem of infrastructural facilities.  He noted that the nature of the soil in Anambra State had  created enormous ecological problems, especially soil erosion.  He said it was necessary to try a new technology that had won  international recognition.  <H5>  TANZANIA </H5>   Dar es Salaam Radio Tanzania Network in Swahili at 1700 GMT  on 26 April states two Chinese nationals have been arrested by  police after they were found in illegal possession of 135 pieces  of ivory valued at more than 4 million shillings at a Kinondoni  District house in Dar es Salaam. The Dar es Salaam regional  police commander, Ndugu Tryphon Maji, identified the Chinese as  (Shen Wen Hou) alias (Chieng Chen) and (Niyaw Huwau Wen), both  residing at 102, Victoria House. He said the Chinese were also  found in illegal possession of an assortment of minerals,  including rubies. The police commander said the value of the  minerals, weighing 100 kg, has so far not been determined.    Ndugu Maji said one of the Chinese offered the police about  1  million shillings as a bribe to avert arrest, but the police  declined the offer. He said the money had also been handed over  to the police.

The reserve, which is  confronted with serious environmental deterioration, abounds in  natural resources which represent various economic, scientific,  and esthetic interests. It is even recognized as part of the  world network of biosphere reserves. In fact, for many months  now, the Luki reserve has been confronted with deforestation  problems as a result of extensive agricultural activities,  illegal exploitation, and indiscriminate occupation of forest  zones. To minimize damage, the authorities have decided to  demarcate the reserve, repair bridges, and ensure the  maintenance of roads. They have also decided to erect 105  boards to ensure the protection of this ecosystem.</p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Management (In A Nutshell): Keeping a check on the banks More than half of business customers may be paying incorrect interest charges to their bank, according to a survey carried out by Phoenix Finance Management, a Northampton-based supplier of computer software. Phoenix surveyed customers who had bought its Bankchek program, which checks to see if interest is being properly calculated, and found that 67 out of 116 respondents had discovered discrepancies. Eleven had received refunds, usually accompanied by explanations and apologies, while 30 others were challenging their banks. Some businessmen and women found a new bank manager was unaware of verbal agreements reached with a predecessor and then imposed a higher rate which went undetected for months or even years. Often customers were unaware of the penalty rates of interest which applied when an overdraft limit was exceeded. Phoenix Tel 0604 259211</p>

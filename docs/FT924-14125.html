			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: The down-sizing of Great Britain Plc INDEXED bonds are the investment flavour of the month. They may look boring, but they have one great merit: they offer all-risks anti-Tory insurance. If our future is to be slump, real interest rates will fall; if we get the traditional inflationary dash for growth, investors are still covered. There is even a bonus: as indexed issues pile up, the market is at last gaining real liquidity. This alone may help to drive yields down further. Indexed will be a bad choice only if we can expect an ordinary cyclical recovery. This seems at best an outside chance, because in Brighton last week the Tories lived fully up to their old name - the stupid party. Patriotism, clearly, is the last refuge not only of scoundrels, but of fools. We were left with foreign policy of sulking our way into Europe, an economic policy of blind faith in men of proved poor judgment, and a government not only facing recession, as most are, but with not the ghost of an idea of what to do about it. On the contrary, it seems bent on making a bad situation worse. One example must suffice: the apparent decision, in the name of public expenditure control, not to build a Jubilee Line extension to Docklands. This will have an effect not only on the PSBR, but on the banks, which will have to make further large provisions against their Docklands book. This loss of capital can only be met by further attempts to down-size bank balance sheets: by calling in loans, and refusing new ones, and by squeezing surviving borrowers for more revenue. These are the very actions which have already produced the worst downturn for a generation. Has any official warned ministers about this? From the Bank, very possibly; but from the treasury, probably not. There has been no signxyet in what ministers say, or more significantly in what they do, that they understand the financial forces which drive debt deflation. The Fed knows about them, and so do the Japanese and Australians; but not Mr Major and his backward-walking crew. The one implied hope that was left was that sterling devaluation would enable the UK to enjoy more than its share of a recovery initiated by wiser policies in other countries. But this seems unlikely. The only big reflation is planned in Japan; but Japanese demand for imports is so low this will have little impact. So far as the UK is concerned, fiscal deflation in Germany, Italy, and Sweden, with its depressing impact in neighbouring countries, will more than outweigh whatever Tokyo may do. This leaves the US. Assuming that Governor Clinton does nothing disastrous, a change of regime and of policies can be expected there. The new policies will include a public investment stimulus on New Deal lines, which is possible because the US fiscal rules, unlike British, allow investment spending to be counted off-budget. With a friendly Congress, an effective attack on Washington waste is also possible. This is a promising approach; and since any real US recovery is also likely to trigger a strong dollar recovery, the international impact will be truly helpful. Don't rush to buy equities, though. Investment spending always has a lumbering take-off; and Mr Clinton's record is that of a cautious man. Wall Street would look attractive, were it not for the clear risk of a crash between now and lift-off. London is still caught in a trap of ever-downward expectations. In London, the only hope lies in interest rates. The anti-inflationary rhetoric in Brighton makes cuts likelier than not. This is the normal cover story of those about to relax monetary policy, as Mr Paul Volcker memorably showed in 1982. His huge interest rate cuts were prefaced by an anti-inflationary lecture so fierce it frightened the bond markets. But can any plausible cuts offset the government's determination to deflate at the bottom of a recession, while resisting the deep devaluation which worked this trick in 1982? Indexed still look the best sterling bet for the cautious. For bold pessimists, conventionals.</p>

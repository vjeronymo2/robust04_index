			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Watchdog hits at quality of loan advice - A new Consumers' Association survey ENDOWMENT mortgages continue to be oversold because of the commission they generate, according to the Consumers' Association's monthly magazine, Which? It claims mortgage advice given by banks, building societies and brokers often is misleading and inaccurate. At their peak in 1988, mortgages linked to an endowment policy - a long-term life insurance savings plan - accounted for 84 per cent of new mortgages sold. That proportion has now fallen to 68 per cent. Posing as home-buyers. the researchers for Which? visited 100 lenders across the country. Mortgage advice was given by 72 advisers and the results are based on those replies. In 78 per cent of cases, it was found that endowments were the main recommendation even though a repayment mortgage would have been just as suitable. Repayment mortgages do not pay commission, since there are no insurance-related products involved. Instead, capital and interest are repaid over the term of the loan. But the researchers found that when repayment mortgages were discussed, the tendency was to focus on their drawbacks compared with endowments. Lenders where this tendency was particularly marked included Abbey National, Bank of Ireland and Barclays bank. Which? also says that 'advisers frequently twisted the facts to recommend endowment mortgages.' Some staff said an endowment guaranteed to pay off the mortgage - which is untrue. This claim came from Abbey National, Bank of Scotland, Derbyshire BS, Leeds &amp; Holbeck BS, National Westminster bank and TSB. Although it is probable that most endowment policies will perform well enough to pay off mortgages, Which? says advisers should have pointed out there was a risk they might not - especially since life companies have been cutting bonuses. Even when asked which type of mortgage would be better if the potential buyer was to sell his house and move abroad within a few years, endowments were recommended as the best option in 87 per cent of cases. This is not the best advice, since the buyer would have to continue paying premiums into the endowment policy from abroad even after selling the property. The few companies which suggested, correctly, that a repayment mortgage would be better in such circumstances were Alliance &amp; Leicester, Bradford &amp; Bingley (which recommended a mortgage linked to a personal equity plan for its flexibility), Halifax, National &amp; Provincial, Northern Rock, Royal Bank of Scotland, and Slater Hogg Mortgages in Edinburgh. 'Endowments are a major source of profit, and it is clear that employees are encouraged to sell them,' says Which? But one heartening finding was that most staff resisted the temptation to 'churn' - advising customers to cash-in their existing endowment policy and take out a new one. They were asked by researchers, posing as husband and wife, what should be done with her existing endowment policy since the couple wanted to buy a more expensive house. Most staff recommended that she keep the original endowment and take out an additional one for the extra amount borrowed. But Barclays suggested she take out a new endowment to cover both her and her husband, and either cash-in her existing policy or continue it as a savings plan.</p>

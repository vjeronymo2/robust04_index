			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Arts: Candide's candid charms IF EVER a writer were famous for ridiculing others' views and finding himself stuck with them, it is Francois Marie Arouet de Voltaire (1694-1778). His Candide (1759) pilloried the optimistic enlightenment idea: 'tout est pour le mieux dans le meilleur des mondes', and it became his catchphrase. Leonard Bernstein's musical, Candide, was written and rewritten between 1956 and 1974 with contributions from Lillian Hellman, John Latouche, Dorothy Parker and Stephen Sondheim; its history was proof of Voltaire's own saying that the best is the enemy of the good. Now it has reached the Richmond Theatre in south west London in a production by the Liverpool Everyman. It makes a fine intellectual pantomime: colourful, energetic and entertaining. This is a picaresque tale of Candide and his fiancee Cunegonde, their adventures in Westfalia, Spain, Latin America and Constantinople; it amounts to a chaotic progress through Jesuit, Catholic, New World and Old World values. One can almost hear Michael Palin packing for a 'Candide's footsteps' TV travelogue. Bernstein wraps up with advice from Voltaire: do not seek Happiness or Knowledge, do not think, just dig the garden. This production's strengths lie in its simplicity and ingenuity. The set is a schoolroom with oversize alphabet boxes and a slide. Director John Doyle keeps the action moving at the speed of thought; the design is flexible and the costumes are a delight, all bold coloured Lycra with added ruffs and flounces. The small cast doubles as musicians. Once Bernstein's vertiginous overture is negotiated, the music and theatre hold together well. The choruses are peppy and upbeat, including the peerless 'What a day for an Auto-da-Fe' sung by the Spanish Inquisitors. There is fine singing from Elena Ferrari (Cunegonde) and Kim Harwood (as the sexy maid, Paquette) opposite Richard Felix as a felicitous Candide. Helen Ireland and Millie Taylor at the synthesizer are the rest of the orchestra. After Candide, Bernstein wrote West Side Story (1957). The key song in Candide here is an answer to the more famous 'America'; it is a lovely rumba, 'Easily Assimilated' sung by a Russian baroness (Judith Bruce) in a Colombian brothel, and is about being a world citizen, fitting in to an America which now contained all the worlds visited by Candide. Maybe it was America which turned out to be the best of all possible worlds. The Richmond Theatre (081-940-0088) until May 1</p>

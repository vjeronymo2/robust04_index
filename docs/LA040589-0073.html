			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Imprisoned members of West Germany's extremist Red Army Faction rejected an  offer of mediation by parliamentary leader Rita Suessmuth and will continue a  63-day-old hunger strike "even if it means they starve to death," their  attorneys said in Bonn. The lawyers said the Red Army members will stop their  fast only if authorities meet their demand to be moved from separate cells  among those of other inmates to common holding areas where they can be  together. Thirty-eight Red Army activists and sympathizers imprisoned at  various sites around West Germany have taken part in the hunger strike.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alija Behran from Mostar] </F>   [Excerpts] Convoys of expelled Bosniak Muslims are again  arriving from the western part of Mostar, which is partly  controlled by Boban's Ustasha units and partly by the Croatian  Army, in a new wave of ethnic cleansing of the non-Croatian  population. Two nights ago, the defenders of the city received  six of our fellow citizens on the demarcation line in the  People's Revolution Boulevard [Bulevar Narodne Revolucije].  They were ruthlessly expelled by HVO fighters late at night,  without even being allowed to take with them the most basic  belongings. At 1330 today, another six people -- mostly women,  children, and old folk -- arrived in the eastern, free part of  the city across the [word indistinct] bridge from the direction  of the airport [word indistinct]. They were forcefully evicted  from their homes. Boban's fighters came wearing hoods over  their heads, these expelled Mostar people told me, with the  obvious motive of looting and moving into other people's homes.  [passage omitted]    The [Mostar] War Presidency sees this latest wave of ethnic  cleansing of the Bosniak Muslims from the western part of Mostar  as part of the long-term project to change completely the  demographic structure of the Neretva River Valley. The final  outcome is to have a Croatian majority in the Mostar commune and  the Neretva River Valley, who would then -- in the final stage  of breaking up Bosnia-Herzegovina -- decide in a referendum to  live in the Croatian state.

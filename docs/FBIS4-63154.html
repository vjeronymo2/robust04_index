			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku, 19 May (TURAN) -- Twenty-seven members of the  Milli Mejlis support Bishkek Protocol and they addressed an  appeal to the Azeri nation.    The appeal reads that "a six-year-old war of Armenia against  Azeri nation worsened socio-economic and military-political  situation and presently it also threatens to the state system."    "We have to seek for peaceful ways to put an end to this  devastating war."    The deputies stood against "a wide campaign several  political  parties and media waged today."    "We condemn the activities of those parties, which are aimed  against the achievement of national unity and civil consent and  which are not in the interests of Azerbaijan."    The deputies consider Bishkek Protocol as a move aimed at  end  of the war and the achievement of peace in Azerbaijan.    The document mentions that the signing of Bishkek Protocol  does not mean that the UNO [United Nations Organization] and the  CSCE will not take part in the peacemaking mission in the region  since Russia cannot take part in the process of peace  restoration alone.    The deputies hope that "the Azeri Government will protect  normal mediatorial efforts further more."    The members of the Milli Mejlis accused the opposition of  using Bishkek Protocol for political purposes, that is to cause  instability in the republic and come to power.    The appeal was when 17 members of the Milli Mejlis left the  Parliament building in token protest of the intention of the  authorities to accept the Russian settlement plan. The deputies  consider that this plan infringe on Azerbaijan's interests and  they will fight against its putting into execution.</p>

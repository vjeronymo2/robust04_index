			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Servomex Servomex, the East Sussex-based gas analyser and instrumentation systems manufacturer, reported pre-tax profits ahead from Pounds 2.06m to Pounds 2.11m in the 1992 year. Mr John Burton, chairman, said the advance, which came from turnover up Pounds 1.44m to Pounds 19.7m, was due to the significantly reduced interest burden, down from Pounds 314,000 to Pounds 130,000. Earnings per share worked through at 14.1p (13.8p) and a proposed final dividend of 4p raises the total to 5.9p (5.7p). Mr Burton also announced that he would be standing down as chairman after the annual meeting.</p>

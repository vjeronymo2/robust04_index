			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (19): Pillar for economic growth - The agricultural sector Agriculture remains Bolivia's single most important sector of the economy, representing 20 per cent of gross domestic product, and agro-industrial products are presently experiencing the fastest growth of any exports. This is not a cyclical trend; agricultural development will be a pillar for economic growth in years to come. The main reason is that Bolivia is discovering that it has comparative advantages in specific agricultural products - and it has enormous tracts of undeveloped and extremely fertile land in its eastern frontier. Contrary to other tropical regions in the Amazon basin, the fluvial plains in the province of Santa Cruz boast soils extremely rich in nutrients that produce above-average yields. While soya producers in neighbouring countries harvest an average of 1.5 tonnes a hectare, Bolivian farmers reap 2.5 to 3 tonnes a hectare. The tropical climate allows two soya harvests a year, of which the larger one is in the wet season between November and April. Prospects are so promising that foreign investors, especially from Brazil and Argentina, are flocking to the area in search of sizeable tracts of land to grow soya beans and other crops. Although some of the soya production still leaves the country without any processing - soya worth Dollars 13m was exported in 1993 - large quantities are being processed into oil, flour or animal feed. Despite considerable growth figures last year, however, the agricultural sector faces significant difficulties. Interest rates on loans are still high, preventing capital investment in technology. Irrigation is virtually non-existent and dependency on rainfall does not allow for steady returns. This year, a prolonged drought caused estimated losses of Dollars 20m in soya, wheat, sunflower and fruit production. In addition, the region's limited infrastructure complicates the transport of agro-exports. Producers complain that transportation to Chile's distant Arica port is costly and that roads are in poor condition. The Paraguay-Parana waterway, which flows into the Rio Plata near Buenos Aires, provides a less expensive alternative shipping route. But the train service from Santa Cruz to Puerto Suarez on the river Paraguay has a limited cargo capacity. The influential lowland agriculture association, CAO, demands more support from the government as well as a coherent development plan for the sector. Mr Erwin Reck, CAO's president, urges the creation of a ministry of agricultural development and the construction of strategic roads in the region, as well as cheaper credits. The small-scale farming of more traditional products by campesinos of the highlands is a sharp contrast to the large agro-industrial production of Bolivia's lowlands. A large percentage of Bolivia's highland rural population ekes out a living in subsistence farming, while others manage to market excess production of foodstuffs. One product from the largely bleak and agriculturally poor Altiplano that has seen rapid growth - and is now being exported - is the quinua, a small, disk-shaped grain which has been a staple in the Andes for thousands of years and has recently seen a resurgence as a health food in Europe and the US. Quinua has higher nutritional value than any other grain commercially available. The Association of Quinua producers, Anapqui, has been promoting exports of the product, making Bolivia the world's leading producer. Anapqui, incorporating 3,000 producers of quinua, claims that 60 per cent of Bolivia's total is exported and this grows by 20 per cent annually. Mr Francisco Valderrama, head of Anapqui, says that continued growth of quinua production in Bolivia will depend on the country's ability to satisfy consumer demand for specific quinua products, such as ready-to-eat cereals or snacks. 'Above all we have to capitalise on the advantage in quality we have over other producers to increase and defend our market share,' says Mr Valderrama. Although the US and Canada are producing large quantities of quinua, they have reportedly not been able to match the size and quality of the Andean product. Another up-and-coming export product that has been grown in the region for thousands of years are textiles made of alpaca, from a domesticated version of the Andean llama. Exports last year totalled Dollars 4m. Hand-knitted designer sweaters 'made in Bolivia' are on sale in boutiques and department stores in the US and Europe. Mr Gerald Fisher, a US expatriate, who has been supplying US department stores and mail order catalogues for 20 years, says: 'Alpaca is a fibre that has awaken.' His sweaters, designed by a well known New York fashion designer and knitted by indigenous women in the highlands, retail for Dollars 195 to Dollars 295 in the US. Beatrice Patino's Coats and suits in Alpaca textiles by Beatrice Patino have been featured in New York as an alternative to garments in traditional luxury fibres such as cashmere or mohair. Patino moved her business from 7th Avenue, to a back street in a popular neighbourhood in La Paz. The Bolivian Export Foundation (FBE), a non-profit organisation funded by the World Bank and the Dutch and Swiss governments, goes beyond merely identifying potential export products to co-finance their production. Unlike other aid organisations, the FBE conducts detailed feasibility studies on specific products before entering into a joint venture with local enterprises or communities. Mr Romel Antelo, secretary of the directorate, says that while other development non-governmental organisations are often careless about where they put their money, the FBE has to make a positive return on its investment to continue operating. 'We operate very much like a private enterprise, carefully studying the investment opportunities,' says Antelo. The FBE is presently financing a garlic producing venture with 120 peasant families in Tarija, southern Bolivia, who contribute the land as their part of the deal. The FBE expects to recuperate its Dollars 300,000 investment after the first harvest.</p>

			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Investor hits at bonus cut - Casebook IT MAY just be good timing. But the announcement by Friends Provident on May 1 that it is cutting terminal bonus rates on its with profits policies might provoke cynical comment. The announcement was made just after comprehensive surveys were carried out by Money Marketing and Money Management, authoritative industry sources which financial advisers use to recommend the best policies for their clients. Friends Provident came fourth in Money Marketing's table of top ten endowment performers over ten years. If the cuts had been announced before the survey, Friends Provident would have dropped down the tables, and possibly out of the top ten. Friends Provident had already cut its bonuses at the beginning of the year and Benjamin Lemer, whose family owns several Friends Provident policies, is angry about these new cuts. 'Companies take a view once a year. If they change their mind every other week, how can you make rational investment decisions?' In April, Lemer received a letter from Friends Provident informing him of the pay-out rate on one of his policies which is about to mature. But a few days later he received another letter informing him that he would be getting less. 'To cancel letters that have already gone out is really to shoot yourself in the foot,' says Lemer, who has decided not to invest in the company's products in future. Assuming a 29-year-old non-smoking male paid monthly premiums of Pounds 35, the pay-out from a ten-year endowment would have been Pounds 9,260 at January 1 1992. But after the cut in the terminal bonus rate, the comparable figure for maturity at May 1 was Pounds 8,701 - a difference of Pounds 559, a 6 per cent drop. Using the same assumptions Money Marketing, with figures for maturity values at February 1, before the terminal bonus was cut, put Friends Provident's figure at Pounds 9,176. The value for the last member of its top ten, Commercial Union, was Pounds 8,746. The effect of the cut on 25-year maturity values would also have pushed Friends Provident down the table. If our investor had paid Pounds 20 a month for a 25-year endowment, his pay-out at January 1 would have been Pounds 42,266, but after the cut a policy maturing on May 1 would be worth Pounds 41,623. Graham Aslet, general manager at Friends Provident, who acknowledges that announcements on rates are usually made at the beginning of the year, said that the decision was taken after a valuation report prepared for the Board in April. 'We said in December 1991 that we were entering a period of lower returns and low inflation. This year saw the return of the Conservative government and therefore a commitment to the Exchange Rate Mechanism.' Lemer is unimpressed, particularly since the stock market reached an all-time high last week. 'You could argue that when inflation and interest rates are low, then the stock market might take off as people look for investment alternatives. We were in the ERM in January, Labour was committed to keeping us in it and Friends Provident made its cuts in January. What has changed between January and now to justify further cuts?'</p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Polish privatisation vote Poland's government won a clear majority in parliament at the weekend on a first reading for its modified mass privatisation proposals involving the transfer of 600 state sector enterprises into privately owned, foreign managed National Investment Funds, Christopher Bobinski writes from Warsaw The draft legislation now goes forward to committee stage where former communist SLD deputies, who voted for a first reading after gaining concessions from the government, are to resume pressure for further amendments to the plan. These focus on giving the enterprises selected for the scheme by the government the right to opt out. The weekend vote puts the government's privatisation strategy back on track for the moment, giving Mr Janusz Lewandowski, the privatisation minister who last Friday survived a vote of no confidence, a breathing space.</p>

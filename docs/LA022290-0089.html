			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PURCHASE OF SCHOOL SITE IS CANCELED BY DEVELOPER  </P> <P> Downey Unified School District officials said the city has imposed so many  restrictions and given so much conflicting information to a Los Angeles-based  home builder that he has canceled an agreement to buy a surplus school site for  $9 million.  </P> <P> The district planned to use the money to make badly needed repairs at Downey  High School and other school sites, school officials said.  </P> <P> Officials said they expect the cancellation will delay the refurbishing  temporarily. They said they will continue to seek buyers for the site.  </P> <P> M.J. Brock &amp; Sons Inc. informed the district last week that the agreement  was canceled because of additional restrictions being placed on the proposed  development by the city, schools Supt. Edward A. Sussman said.  </P> <P> The company received a letter from the city Planning Department outlining so  many obstacles that Brock decided to not go through with the deal, Sussman  said.  </P> <P> In September, the Board of Education approved the sale of 10.5-acre Edith  Unsworth Elementary School at 9001 Lindsey Ave. The Brock company proposed to  build single-family homes on the site.  </P> <P> The district was to receive $6.75 million from Brock once the sale cleared  escrow. The remaining $2.25 million was to be paid as homes were sold.  </P> <P> The district planned to use about $5 million of the money to refurbish several  buildings at Downey High School, and the remainder to pay for renovation at  other schools in the district.  </P> <P> The developer must meet city planning, zoning and building requirements to  construct the project. City officials said they have not been unreasonable nor  placed too many restrictions on the project.  </P> <P> "We felt that Brock had a very workable plan, but there were some problems,"  Assistant City Manager Ken Farfsing said.  </P> <P> Farfsing said the developer had not submitted a formal application but was  proposing to build 85 homes on lots smaller than allowed by the city. Farfsing  said the developer revised the plan by reducing the number of homes, but the  proposed streets were not wide enough for parking and safety reasons. The city  also required the developer to use two lots for a small park.  </P> <P> The city was prepared to meet with the developer to discuss the requirements  when the company canceled the agreement with the school district, Farfsing  said.  </P> <P> Eric Bathen, legal counsel for the school district, accused the city of "just  giving the developer the runaround."  </P> <P> Farfsing denied the charge. He said it is "part of the process we go through  with developers."  </P> <P> Bathen said he received a letter from the development company last Tuesday  saying that the company was withdrawing because of "mixed signals and  inconsistency" from city officials and because of the declining real estate  market.  </P> <P> Bathen said the developer had estimated that the proposed homes could sell for  between $300,000 and $400,000.  </P> <P> Bathen said the district had received a deposit of $100,000 and was to receive  an additional deposit of $150,000 Feb. 12, but after getting the city's letter  on the same day, the developer decided to cancel the agreement.  </P> <P> Brock vice president Les Thomas said he would have no comment on the matter.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Sussman said the district would continue to negotiate with Brock and  other developers to work out a deal.  </P> <P> "We are optimistic we can work something out," Sussman said. "We are trying to  do the very best for the district and for the city. We also have an obligation  to get all of our schools refurbished."  </P> <P> Downey High School has several buildings that are in need of repair, Sussman  said. The school was built in 1939 and has never had any major renovation.  </P> <P> The district purchased 35 portable classrooms for $1.4 million for use by the  students during remodeling, which was expected to start in June, Sussman said.  </P> <P> Sussman said the district plans to move nearly half of the high school's 2,500  students into the portable classrooms while the district continues a search for  money to refurbish.  </P> <P> In 1988, voters rejected a bond issue that would have generated $11.4 million  to renovate district schools.  </P> <P> The board voted to sell Unsworth Elementary School last year and use the money  for renovation. Unsworth was closed in 1972 because of a decline in student  enrollment.  </P></p>

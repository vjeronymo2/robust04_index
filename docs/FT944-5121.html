			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Poll gives Delors a wider lead Mr Jacques Delors yesterday widened his lead over other potential French presidential candidates in an opinion poll that coincided with strong denials by the Balladur government of reports that it is trying to help Mr Bernard Tapie challenge the outgoing European Commission president for the left-wing vote. The Ifop poll in the Journal du Dimanche showed that Mr Delors, with 23 per cent support, was the preferred presidential candidate over 13 others, led by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur with 17 per cent and followed by Mr Jacques Chirac with 11 per cent. Mr Delors has promised to announce by Christmas whether he will run for president. With 6 per cent in yesterday's Ifop poll, Mr Tapie still runs fourth among presidential preferences. But some pundits believe that the maverick Mr Tapie could eat into Mr Delors' electoral base if he too, were to run for the presidency, and some newspapers suggested late last week that this is just what Mr Balladur is seeking to arrange by keeping Mr Tapie out of the bankruptcy court, to the annoyance of the justice ministry.</p>

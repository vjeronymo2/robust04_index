Elf Aquitaine is raising its stake in Spanish oil refiner Cepsa, becoming the company's second largest shareholder. This is part of the deal which sees Cepsa buy its smallest domestic competitor, Ertoil, from Elf. The sale by US defence electronics group Loral of 49 per cent of its satellite business to Aerospatiale and Alcatel Espace, and Italy's Alenia, concludes an agreement made last October. The transaction, taken together with their joint purchase of Boeing's Canadian subsidiary, De Havilland, underlines the determination of Aerospatiale and Alenia to break into the US and the specialised satellite business. Contributing to the boom in receiverships, French property group Actimo is buying Pascal, the Canadian hardware chain. Construction company Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez will see its stake in UK building group Alfred McAlpine double to 12 per cent as a result of McAlpine's 1-for-2 rights issue. The realignment of interests in Europe's financial services sector continued with Dutch insurance group Aegon buying the 99 per cent of Belgian insurer Precam owned by France's Athena. Joining the flow of western car makers into eastern Europe is Suzuki of Japan. Its 40 per cent stake in the joint venture Magyar Suzuki will make it the first Japanese car manufacturer to assemble cars in the region. The sale of Pilkington Reinforcements to Nippon Sheet Glass of Japan is part of the Pilkington group's reorganisation strategy, which involves the disposal of non-core assets and the elimination of loss-making operations.</p>

			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WHY RUSH TO VEGAS?  </P> <P> Am I missing something, somewhere, along the way? Admittedly, there are a lot  of projects under way these days that I don't understand. Some of them are  highly technical, and thus are beyond me.  </P> <P> But there is one basically simple one that is nonetheless beyond my  comprehension.  </P> <P> Will somebody please tell me: What is the burning need -- or for that matter,  any need at all -- for a high-speed rail line between Anaheim and Las Vegas?  </P> <P> With so many really worthy projects that could better use the money, I have to  ask: Who needs to get from Anaheim to Las Vegas -- or back -- in a hurry? For  what reason? And if it's that important, why can't they do it by air?  </P> <P> ALLYN M. SUFFENS  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

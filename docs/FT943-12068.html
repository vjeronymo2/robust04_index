			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Observer: A split in time It is surely another sign that things are returning to normal after last year's upheavals at Barclays when the chairman Andrew Buxton is spotted out-and-about on non-bank business. Buxton is taking over from Sir David Lees as chairman of the CBI's economic affairs committee, and was yesterday on show at Lees' last presentation of the Quarterly Trends survey. Buxton agreed that it would have been harder to find the time for such public duties had he not split the role of chairman and chief executive. Yes, he confided, he had indeed been reluctant to split the job so quickly after taking the tiller at the bank, but he had eventually succumbed to pressure from institutional investors. Now, with the arrival of Martin Taylor in the chief executive's seat, he professed himself a total convert. 'I'm a walking advertisement for splitting the roles,' was his comment.</p>

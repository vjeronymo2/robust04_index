			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Allied London Props jumps to Pounds 6.8m Allied London Properties, the property investor and developer, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.49m to Pounds 6.8m in the year to June 30. Net rental income rose from Pounds 17.1m to Pounds 18.7m. Trading profits amounted to Pounds 438,000 (Pounds 562,000) and other income totalled Pounds 1.88m (Pounds 1.39m). An exceptional debit of Pounds 3.5m last time reflected a reduction in the value of the group's housebuilding assets. An unchanged final dividend of 2.455p is recommended to maintain the total at 3.53p. Earnings per share worked through at 5p against losses of 1.5p. Net asset value per share stood at 85p at June 30 against 90p a year earlier. Fully diluted, the figure was 95p (100p). At the year end the property portfolio was valued at Pounds 180m.</p>

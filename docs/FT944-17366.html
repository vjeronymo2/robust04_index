			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais reduces first-half charge Credit Lyonnais, the financially-troubled French banking group, reduced the level of provisions it was planning to make for the first half of the year by more than FFr1bn (Dollars 180m) after last-minute discussions with regulators. This reduced the overall level of provisions to FFr10.1bn. Many analysts believe this is only about half the level that will be required to cope with the legacy of non-performing loans inherited from the bank's activities over the past few years. Banking sources suggested yesterday that planned provisions in the six months to June 30 on its exposure to activities in other countries were reduced by up to FFr2bn after discussions between Credit Lyonnais officers, its new auditors and the French banking commission and state auditing commission. The reduction partly reflects the tensions between Mr Jean Peyrelevade, the chairman of the bank appointed by the government last year, and the economics and finance ministry, which has been resisting the bank's demands for additional state support against outstanding potential liabilities. Government sources suggested this month that Mr Peyrelevade had originally told Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economics minister, that Credit Lyonnais would require provisions of up to FFr25bn. Officials have demanded far more detailed and justified quantification of potential provisions before providing public assurance that they would underwrite the losses this may cause. The bank has been under pressure to sell off core activities as well as industrial investments, although it remains committed to maintaining its European network, which includes about 1,000 branches outside France and 2,200 within the country. It emerged yesterday that Credit Lyonnais was poised to appoint a new member to its executive committee with special responsibilities for internal management support in the restructuring operations. Mr Pascal Lamy, previously director of Mr Jacques Delors' cabinet in Brussels, is reviewing operations within the bank, and is expected shortly to become the fourth member of the committee alongside Mr Peyrelevade, Mr Michel Renault and Mr Dominique Bazy.</p>

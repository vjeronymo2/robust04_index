			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES RIVER  </P> <P> I walk along the Los Angeles River every day from Glendale Boulevard to Los  Feliz Boulevard; either early morning or at sunset.  </P> <P> Over the last few years the river has become beautiful. There are all kinds of  water fowl and birds living in this section of the river.  </P> <P> It is so peaceful, and hard to believe it's so near the Golden State Freeway.  </P> <P> Please spend that $100,000 to clean up the river where thoughtless people have  thrown all kinds of trash, stuck in the middle of the river.  </P> <P> I am not alone. A lot of people enjoy their walks along this "living" river.  </P> <P> MRS. VIVIAN ROCKEFELLER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

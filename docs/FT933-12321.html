			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Markets: Retailers - not a super market / The Bottom Line SIR ALISTAIR Grant, chairman of Argyll, may be rereading his statement to the group's annual meeting this week to find out just what he said to upset the City so much. His statement, although generally positive, knocked 11p off the share price of Argyll, which owns the Safeway superstore chain, and precipitated another round of downgrades of analysts' profits forecasts for the big food retailers. There seems to be little anyone can do to lift the sector, which has underperformed the stock market by more than 10 per cent since January. The main fear is that intensifying competition and a growing price sensitivity among consumers means the big grocery chains cannot sustain the spectacular profit growth enjoyed in the last 10 years. There are two elements to this. One is the fear that the UK food market is approaching saturation, that there is room for only so many superstores before they start 'cannibalising' each other's sales. The second factor is the rapid spread of discount retailers, which cut costs and margins to the minimum and concentrate on offering the lowest possible prices. The 'big three' grocery chains, Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway, have played down these threats. Only Archie Norman, chief executive of Asda, the UK's number four, has broken ranks to warn that the 'halcyon days' of food retailing are at an end. Recently, a third threat has emerged: low inflation. While the government has made strenuous efforts to reduce it, inflation is, in some ways, the retailer's friend. Inflation means the value of a retailer's stock rises between the time goods are bought and re-sold to the consumer, boosting the profit margin. Low inflation means retailers have to be more efficient and cut costs to maintain or increase margins. Although Sir Alistair made some negative noises about 'highly competitive trading conditions', inflation was the real reason the markets reacted badly to his statement. He said current inflation, at just under 1.5 per cent excluding petrol, was 'below our expectation of some modest food price inflation . . . The current year is likely to be somewhat more challenging than anticipated a few weeks ago.' What is strange about the slide in share prices, is that it has affected almost all the big food retailers, except for Asda, which is staging a recovery after getting into financial difficulties at the end of the 1980s. Analysts believe the sector will bounce eventually, but only those companies who are perceived to have got their formula right will gain. 'It's true that it's dog eat dog in food retailing, but some of them are rottweilers, and others are poodles,' says Bill Currie of BZW. 'The big dogs will eat the little dogs.' Sainsbury is agreed to be the rottweiler of the sector. Its shares are recommended by most analysts. Some favour Argyll, but there are fears about its spending on expansion. Tesco, however, is widely out of favour. It has a younger customer base than its rivals, which has been hit harder by the recession and is seen as more susceptible to the charms of the discounters. Opinions differ on Asda. It is seen as a recovery stock, but many analysts believe its price is already high enough. Wm Morrison, the Bradford-based regional superstore operator which was voted the UK's top-performing company by the Institute of Directors, has many supporters in the City. Among the discounters, Kwik Save, the oldest and biggest, is recommended by some. But other analysts fear its decision to extend its range has left it in 'no man's land', as neither a limited-range, deep discounter, nor a discount superstore, and it may lose sales as a result. Shoprite, the fast-expanding chain which operates mainly in Scotland, is the only quoted deep discounter and some analysts believe it offers significant growth potential. But with few opportunities for good news before Tesco's interim results and Asda's AGM in September, the sector may continue its downward drift for a while. Those holding the stronger shares are not advised to sell, but for those who do not, there is probably no rush to buy.</p>

Leaders of federal structures  and presidents of neighboring republics attended the inaugural  ceremonies.    Nikolay Vasilyevich Fedorov was born in 1958 in the Chuvash  SSR [Soviet Socialist Republic] into a peasant family. He is a  Chuvash. He is a lawyer by education. He worked as a senior  instructor in the department of scientific communism of the  Chuvash State University. After his election in 1989 as USSR  people's deputy, he moved to Moscow. He was a member of the USSR  Supreme Soviet, and he headed one of the subcommittees on  questions of legislation, legality, and law and order. He  participated in the development of laws on the press and on the  rights and duties of the Internal Troops of the Ministry of  Internal Affairs of the USSR. He was appointed Minister of  Justice of the RSFSR in July 1990. He was a member of the CPSU  until August 1991. In January of 1992, he spoke against the  edict of the president on the establishment of the Ministry of  Security and Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation. At the  Eighth Congress of People's Deputies, he came out with a  statement that the legislative activity of the Russian  Federation does not always confine itself to the scope of the  Constitution. He retired in April of 1993. He is married and has  two children.    During the inauguration, Nikolay Fedorov took the oath in  two  languages--Russian and Chuvash--to apply all of his strength to  lead the economy of the republic out of the crisis situation and  to promote an increase in the well-being of the people. To the  sound of the Chuvash national anthem, those in attendance were  told that the first president of the republic had assumed  office, in commemoration of which young people in national  costumes presented Nikolay Fedorov with bread, salt, and beer.  According to long-standing tradition, a festive concert was held  after the ceremonial performance.    Having finished celebrating, both the new president of  Chuvashia and the parliament will have to begin work "on  increasing the well-being of the people." Valerian Viktorov, the  head of the Cabinet of Ministers, sent in his resignation,  because he was elected chairman of the Federation Council of  Russia. According to the republic's legislation, the entire  cabinet is also supposed to follow him. Thus, Nikolay Fedorov's  presidency will begin with the formation of a new government, in  coordination with parliament. Parliament is supposed to return  to a consideration of the budget for 1994, which was interrupted  because of the inauguration of the president. This is a very  complicated question for Chuvashia, inasmuch as it had been  receiving a third of its resources as subsidies from the Russian  budget. The size of the subsidies is unknown, since the federal  budget has not been ratified. And indeed there should be no  particular counting on Russia's investment this year: As was  said by Nikolay Smirnov, the present minister of finance of the  republic, they can be received only by the territories that are  acknowledged to be in adverse circumstances. In forming its own  budget, which has not yet been coordinated with the Moscow  budget, the republic, nevertheless, hopes to join the adverse  circumstances category, inasmuch as the volume of products fell  by 40 percent in 1993.</p>

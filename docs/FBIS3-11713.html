PDT Deputy  Vivaldo Barbosa said the two parties are concerned about the  polarization of the candidacies of Luis Inacio Lula da Silva  from the PT [Workers Party] and Fernando Henrique Cardoso from  the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]. Barbosa said the  PDT and the PMDB want to present a new alternative through a  center-left candidate.    One month ago, Rio de Janeiro Governor Leonel Brizola, from  the PDT, promised PMDB President Luiz Henrique that he will not  oppose the creation of a progressive broad front.    Sao Paulo Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho said that after  consulting the grassroots, the general wish is to support the  candidacy of Orestes Quercia as the presidential candidate.  Fleury revealed that he will campaign for Quercia in all states.    The official announcement will be made on 24 March at the  Sao  Paulo Government House during a ceremony in which Quercia and  other Sao Paulo State mayors will be present.</p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Private View: A Wren with the will to shoot and kill - This week, the government announced that the Women's Royal Naval Service would be scuttled. Despite initial protests, however, Wrens have been serving at sea for three years. Christian Tyler meets one of them IN THE DAYS of sail, girls who yearned to go to sea would cut their hair and dress up as cabin boys. There is something boyish, too, about the brisk gait of a certain slim lieutenant on the aircraft carrier Ark Royal. Lieutenant Deborah Heesom trained as a weapons analyst and is the only female officer aboard the Royal Navy's flagship. At the end of the month, this smart and feminine 28-year-old will lose, officially, her sexual identity. For the senior service has crossed the gender bar. The armed forces minister confirmed this week that the Women's Royal Naval Service is to be merged fully with the navy. The retiring commandant, Anne Spencer, will not be replaced. Wrens have been sent to sea for the past three years, and there are 800 afloat today on 27 vessels. In spite of protests by navy wives, occasional complaints of sexual harrassment, and lavish media coverage of what the minister this week tactfully called 'incidents,' the navy continues to proclaim mixed manning a success. Privately, it has commissioned a sociological study. But should women go to war with men? Heesom has just returned from patrolling the Adriatic in support of British troops in Bosnia. For seven months, Ark Royal's crew of 90 Wrens and 1,000 sailors were squashed together like the beef and chicken filling of a multi-decker metal sandwich. The lieutenant appeared unbruised by the experience - although not, as she later revealed, unaffected. Ark Royal was berthed at Portsmouth for an overhaul and I was invited to lunch in the wardroom. There, we met one of Heesom's colleagues in the aircraft support section, a male officer confusingly named Lyn. Afterwards, accompanied by a chaperone Wren from the Ministry of Defence, we adjourned to a vacant cabin. For thousands of years, I said, all the fighting has been done by men. Isn't there something inappropriate about women going to war? 'No, I don't think so,' Heesom replied. 'Only really this century have women started to stand up and be noticed. If we are capable and intelligent enough to do the jobs, there is absolutely no reason why we shouldn't. 'OK, you may think we should have babies and stay at home and look after them. But there are an awful lot of females who would argue that point. We want to have the same opportunities, do the same things.' If you were required - it's not going to happen to you - to shoot a man with a rifle, would you do it? 'You say it's never going to happen but, if you are trained to do it, it becomes automatic. It's the camaraderie, it's the unit that's fighting, not you as an individual.' Would you knowingly kill another human being? 'I don't think anybody would like to answer that easily, male or female. If it was me or him, then most definitely.' Would you like to see action? 'I don't think anybody likes war, do they?' Then why join the navy? 'To defend the country in peace time. If war did occur, then we'd go and defend our country. But nobody wants to go to war.' I mentioned the case of a United States army woman driver in Panama who was said to have cracked up under fire. 'It could happen to a man, too. I don't think you can separate it by gender. It can affect people in the strangest ways, be they male or female.' The fact that you are capable of bearing children makes no difference? 'No. I don't think so.' Heesom eventually conceded that men and women - she calls them males and females - might have a different attitude to the job. Some men quite like fighting, I observed. 'So might some women. I don't know. But I think it's a strange individual who wants to go to war and kill people.' You make it sound like an office job. She laughed. 'No, not at all.' Debbie Heesom wanted a vocation, considered the police, and joined the Wrens 10 years ago with A-level maths, further maths and physics from a Cheshire grammar school. She took a degree in naval engineering and trained at Dartmouth. I asked if she were the tomboy type. She laughed, warily. 'I wouldn't say tomboy but I liked doing some things boys did. I was in a big marching band, which was mixed gender. I never felt competitive. I never felt I was out to achieve and prove something. 'The fact that I'm in the military doesn't mean I'm a tomboy. And I think the majority of Wrens aren't. They're very feminine. We don't walk around with sort of bovver boots and jeans on.' (Some do. Later, I read that Commandant Spencer was startled to meet a Wren stoker with 'Mum' tattooed on her shaven head). Seagoing Wrens are allowed to wear make-up if it is discreet - some choose a shade of eye shadow to match the blue of their stripes. They can even wear nail varnish. They may sunbathe when they are free and the flight deck is open. Topless? 'Er, no. I don't think the girls would want to. They have pride and standards.' Suppose the ship took a direct hit, I continued, and there was a lot of blood and guts and twisted metal about. Would you be able to do what the men would? 'Yes, because I'm trained as thoroughly as they are.' Wouldn't they want to get you out of the way? 'That is a possibility, I've got to be honest. They may feel that. However, we are trained to a degree where everything becomes automatic.' In fact, Heesom could not be removed in an emergency. She is in charge of two of the carrier's fire-fighting teams. Are women actually better at some things, then? 'Yes. Some Wrens are smaller and more agile, or they have smaller hands to do intricate work on aircraft maintenance. It's a matter of choosing the right man for the right job, as always.' Do you cry? 'Don't all females?' Her laugh was a rebuke to the male chauvinist before her. 'Er, no. If I feel down, I've got my own cabin to skulk away in. I have friends on board to talk to. We have a camaraderie that's second to none. Everybody has their ups and downs at sea, being away for such long periods of time.' Do you say to yourself: 'I am a Royal Navy officer and I must not cry?' 'Not because I'm a Royal Navy officer. If I was the manager of any company, I wouldn't crack up in front of my employees.' But she would, she admitted, quite like another senior woman to talk with. Have you encountered hostility? 'No, I haven't' Do you encounter male chauvinism? 'Yes, you do, but not often. There's bound to be the odd one or two that do feel anti-female. Generally speaking, we don't get it to our faces. The jokes we have are gender-free. I think they are very aware of the situation, appreciate it's very new. We are professionals doing a job at the end of the day. I personally don't think there's a problem at all.' We had talked about gender. Now I had to ask about sex. Were you not apprehensive about being locked up with a lot of men for so long? Don't people fall in love? 'It does happen. There are three couples getting married from this ship from the last deployment. But people are generally very sensible, professional. 'The no-touching rule exists. So people wait till they get shore-side. When they get into port, they're able to go off as a couple. When they come back on board, they are just able seamen and they do their jobs.' There must be cases where they touch each other, I said. 'Yes, and they get trooped for it - taken in front of the commander. We had two couples fined on the last trip for kissing and cuddling.' What about harrassment? 'People are very aware and it's really up to them, male or female, to know how much they will tolerate before they report it.' Has anyone ever made a pass at you? 'No, no. They don't get the chance.' Have you made a pass at anyone else? 'No, wouldn't dream of it,' she laughed. I asked about the complaining wives of Portsmouth. 'They musn't trust their husbands very much, then, that's my opinion. We are not promiscuous little so-and-so's who are going to go running off with their husbands. Far from it. We have standards and morals as well. But I can see their worries, apprehensions. Nobody likes change.' Is it like a co-ed school, where there is an undercurrent of sex but discipline to prevent it? 'No, we're adults. We're mature human beings. We've joined the service and we accept the rules.' Heesom was not, I thought, trying merely to put the best gloss on things for the benefit of her audience. A naval vessel, especially one the size of Ark Royal, is more like a factory-cum-hostel than a ship. 'If I worked in an office with a guy that I really liked,' she pointed out, 'I wouldn't start groping him in the office. 'I might go out for a drink with him in the evening, away from work. It's the same thing.' Earlier, I had asked Heesom about her marital status and she told me she was divorced. Have you thought of getting married again? She paused for a second. ' . . . em, yes,' then laughed. 'Yes, I have.' It emerged that she was talking about an observer stationed at Culdrose naval air station in Cornwall. You met on this ship? The lieutenant wriggled but agreed. She said he had been assigned to a fighter aboard Ark Royal for the duration of the Adriatic tour. She saw him every day. You fell in love with him, not to put too fine a point on it? At this point, the ministry's chaperone intervened with some haste. 'She met him at sea but the relationship itself has blossomed since.' Heesom agreed that was it. Still, given the subject we had been discussing, I thought it was a courageous admission.</p>

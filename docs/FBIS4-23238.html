			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The elections for a national constitutional  conference, organized by the military government, ended on  schedule over the weekend, in spite of a boycott in some parts  of the country. Well, the boycott was called by the NADECO, the  National Democratic Coalition. NADECO say they want a sovereign  national conference, whose decisions would be final, instead of  this one, which they fear may not have any significant powers.  The government says that the conference will start its work on  27 June on schedule, but NADECO says that, in spite of that, its  boycott will continue. Well, the former governor of Ogun State,  Chief Segun Osoba, is a leading member of NADECO. Sola Odunfa  met him and asked him what they are going to do now:    [Begin recording] [Osoba] We intend to start series of  legitimate actions, legitimate actions -- I want to repeat -- to  ensure that we get our rights.    [Odunfa] The military government has all instruments of  coercion. The first which they can use is to arrest all of you  and dump you in detention. Are you prepared for that?    [Osoba] I have told my family that as soon as they do not  hear from me, they should know that I have been arrested. We  are all ready, in fact fully mobilized, to be detained, and we  are fully ready for whatever action the government may want to  take.    [Odunfa] Is this action not belated? Why did you not take  this action when the election was annulled last year?    [Osoba] At that time, the government created a division  within the political class, and they were using the leadership  of the two political parties to cause the confusion, and so  there was no united front. But when the military came in, we  thought we could give them a chance -- hoping that they will  rectify the situation quickly. Up till now, we don't know the  program of this government, which is unfortunate. A military  government should come in to do a surgical operation and leave  immediately. So unfortunately, this government hasn't given us  any political program of any kind. We don't even know the  agenda of this conference, nobody knows the rules and  regulations governing this conference, there is no enabling  decree governing this conference, so everything is illegal. And  that is why we are moving, because we now think that we are back  again to an unending transitional program that we started in  1985.    [Odunfa] Will it therefore be correct to take this, your  proposed action, as a direct confrontation with the military?    [Osoba] I wouldn't call it confrontation with the military,  because we respect the majority of our compatriots in uniform as  being patriotic, and not part of the little clique who want to  cling to power. So, we should separate the military, as a group  who believe that they must go back to professionalism. That  movement started under Babangida, and 99 percent of those still  in uniform are still in support of democratization. But, there  is a small clique of them who are politicians in uniform, who  are bent on staying in power -- a continuous change of baton  from one uniformed military head of state to another one. There  is that small cabal that we are facing, not the entire military.  [end recording]</p>

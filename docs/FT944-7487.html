			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Reed Executive leaps to Pounds 1.91m A growing number of permanent jobs in the south of England contributed to a fourfold increase in pre-tax profits at Reed Executive, the UK's largest employment agency. The company yesterday announced profits of Pounds 1.91m (Pounds 457,000) on turnover up 33 per cent to Pounds 30.8m (Pounds 23.2m) in the third quarter. Mr Alec Reed, chairman, said: 'Employers are worried about retaining staff and are valuing certain temporary staff more. This helps our margins because people are not so interested in negotiating fees.' Earnings per share rose to 2.7p (0.4p) in the quarter.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Stuttgart -- PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat has expressed  confidence in Stuttgart today regarding the signing of the  autonomy agreement for Gaza and Jericho. At an international  news conference at the Daimler-Benz headquarters, 'Arafat  stated, referring to the meeting between him and Israeli Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in Cairo on Tuesday [3 May], that "there  are still a few problems to be settled." He hopes that it will  be possible "to eliminate these obstacles" during the talks.    Asked about the planned date of the signing of the agreement  in Cairo on Wednesday, he pointed out: "Where there is a will,  there is a way." He added: "It takes two to tango, one also  depends on others." He declined to mention a date as to when he  will return to Jerusalem, Jericho, and Gaza. It depends on when  the Israelis will withdraw from these regions. The final  departure of the Israelis was to have been completed by 13  April, 'Arafat stressed. "But you see."    'Arafat paid a one-day visit to Stuttgart today at the  invitation of Daimler boss Edzard Reuter.</p>

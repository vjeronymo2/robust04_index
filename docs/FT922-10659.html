			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Personal View: The new utopias that threaten Europe Has Marxism already been replaced as a political and economic utopia, so soon after its demise? One would think so, to see the influence of liberalism and federalism in shaping tomorrow's Europe. These new ideals have fostered new utopias which pose a serious threat to the European Community's future, both economic and political. On the economic front, the dangers are threefold: competition policy, free trade and monetarism. Of these, competition policy is the most significant. Liberal influence underlies most of the European Commission's powers to deal with trusts, abuses of dominant positions and government subsidies. Although administered with the greatest restraint until the economic expansion of the 1980s, competition policy was given disproportionate importance by two energetic, opinionated competition commissioners, Mr Peter Sutherland and then Sir Leon Brittan, relegating the Treaty of Rome's other policies to secondary roles. Recently, its reach has even extended to regulating industrial concentration, a master stroke of the French presidency which rebounded on it in the De Havilland affair, when the Commission outlawed the planned takeover of the Canadian aircraft company by Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy. At the same time, the Commission launched a witch-hunt against state subsidies, which seriously harmed several EC-owned companies, but did not touch the European subsidiaries of their US and Japanese competitors. European - and especially French - businesses thus find themselves hamstrung on their home turf. The second false utopia is free trade, consecrated in late 1985 by the signing of the Single Act. Although the vast new market, with its elimination of internal borders, was supposed to be a giant step forward for Europe, it was nothing new for large corporations, for which these frontiers had long been merely symbolic. The policy would not have been so bad if a common border to separate the EC from the outside world had been established. But Europe unilaterally disarmed without anything in exchange. In the auto industry, Europe had to beg Tokyo for an agreement that will offer Europe's car market to the Japanese on a silver platter. Since then, European carmakers have all announced redundancies, some of which will be huge. Even including the jobs that will be created by transplants, the European car industry will lose 70,000 employees by 1996. The Japanese car industry will gain 50,000 jobs over the same period. The European policy that creates this situation has to be strange. The third and most recent false utopia is monetarist economics, which emerged with force in Maastricht. The proposed economic and monetary union uses solely monetarist criteria - inflation rates, enforced parities, long-term interest rates and balanced budgets - to arrive at a single European currency. Those who drew up the treaty forgot to organise any co-ordination of national economic policies, without which union can never occur. So the treaty needlessly sacrifices the state's essential rights, and does nothing to solve the real problem: the Ecu's parities with the dollar and the yen. We therefore urgently need to return to reality, and thus to business, which was largely ignored by the Treaty of Rome and which today is threatened by the treaty's blind application. Economic success will never come from an ideology, whether it be protectionist or free trade. On the other hand, economies that really work, like Japan or Germany, owe their success to something else: the primacy of business, and the marshalling of all the nation's vital forces to serve it. Europe must therefore return to three economic truths: Europe is not a marketplace inhabited only by consumers. Establishing a central European authority does not mean creating a power that decides between good and evil, but one that has the best interests of business at heart. Europe does not care about a competition policy; it needs an industrial policy. Concentration must be facilitated, not condemned, and alliances encouraged, as long as they are forged between Europeans. Subsidies must be authorised, as long as they are granted equally and within the framework of a European development policy. A market economy's freedom of action cannot be organised through coercion and intimidation. There must be a political body that sets rules that are clear-cut, stable and the same for everybody, and these rules must favour European companies. Lastly, Europe must stop being afraid of itself. The so-called 'global economy' is merely a smokescreen for European faint-heartedness and US and Japanese ambition. Europe will never be the leading industrial power unless it defends its interests and takes up the same arms as its rivals. If we do not come back to these simple principles, we must realise that the current utopias will bring the downfall of our businesses and the disappearance of our states. The return of economic utopias goes hand in hand with the resurgence of a political utopia: federalism. The centralisation of power leads away from democracy. National parliaments are incapable of keeping track of the twists and turns of decisions of a handful of experts. Day in and day out, these technocrats alter economic realities that none of them understands or cares about. But since Maastricht, federalism has become the official doctrine, even if the term itself was deleted at the last minute at the UK's request. This is particularly disturbing at a time when federal systems are falling apart all over the world, as we can see in Russia, Lebanon, Belgium, Canada and, more tragically, Yugoslavia. Moreover, federalism in Europe is incapable of coping with two important challenges. The first is German expansion. Each day Mitteleuropa is becoming a more powerful reality. It takes an unusual Lilliputian complex to believe that the ties of federalism will lessen the giant's strength. Federalism is based on fear. The EC - and this is the second challenge - is a victim of its own success. Candidates from all sides are flocking to join. Considering the Community already works poorly with 12 members, would it be manageable with 19 or 25? It is imperative that the Community's executive branch be inter-governmental in nature. While it would be tempting to introduce majority rule for the sake of efficiency, this is unacceptable when essential interests are at stake. Furthermore, states must delegate only the minimum authority to Brussels. And we must restore the power of national parliaments, rather than strengthen a European Parliament that so far has failed to be convincing. Today Europe has come to the moment of truth. It will not find salvation in naive or outdated doctrines. What we need is neither 'more Europe' nor 'less Europe' but rather 'another Europe'. The author is chairman of PSA Peugeot Citroen.

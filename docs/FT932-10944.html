			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Olivetti UK back in black with Pounds 1m Good housekeeping and a tight rein on expenses helped Olivetti's UK subsidiary return to profit last year despite deteriorating trading conditions and falling prices. The improvement seems to justify the decision taken at the beginning of 1992 to merge Olivetti Systems and Networks and Olivetti Office into a single company. Profit before tax was Pounds 1.04m, compared with a loss of Pounds 545,000. Turnover was flat at Pounds 202.2m (Pounds 203.5m). Operating expenses were cut from Pounds 40.1m to Pounds 32.6m and interest payments were reduced from Pounds 5m to Pounds 1.6m. Mr Paolo Tosi, Olivetti UK managing director, said the improvement had been the result of a review which reduced operating expenses by 20 per cent. Tight control over working capital and inventory helped to reduce interest costs.</p>

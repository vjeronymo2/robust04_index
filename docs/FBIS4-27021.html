			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 28 (XINHUA) -- Duracell International  Inc. of the United States is investing 60 million U.S. dollars  to establish a joint venture in China to produce alkaline  batteries.    The agreement to effect the establishment of the new joint  venture, the Duracell (China) Corporation, was signed here today  by Duracell International and the Huaxin Industry and Commerce  Corporation of Dongguan city in south China's Guangdong Province.    Chinese Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua met with representatives of  the two sides before the signing of the agreement. The new  project sees the largest investment Duracell has ever poured  into the Asia- Pacific region. Duracell International is  believed to be the leading alkaline battery manufacturer in the  world. Huaxin is a comprehensive enterprise mainly engaging in  hi-tech development.    The new joint venture is designed to produce at least 360  million battery units within two or three years after it goes  into operation in early 1996. About 60 percent of the products  will be sold overseas.    Charles R. Perrin, president of Duracell, also announced  today a donation of 25,000 U.S. dollars to flood-devastated  areas in Guangdong Province.</p>

			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / International Company News: Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, the two largest US debt rating agencies, said they were reviewing the ratings of H. J. Heinz for a possible downgrade, writes Nikki Tait. The announcements came after directors of Heinz, the Pittsburgh-based food group, authorised the 'buy-back' of up to an additional 10m ordinary shares. Heinz has an existing share repurchase programme, which began in December 1991 and was also for 10m shares. However, it now has only 300,000 shares left to repurchase under this earlier authorisation.</p>

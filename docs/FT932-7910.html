			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Charity chief backs moves for 'efficiency' standards BRITAIN'S VOLUNTARY sec-tor, with a turnover of Pounds 17bn, must develop high standards of efficiency and integrity to complement the Charity Commission's regulatory role, Mr Richard Fries, chief charity commissioner, said yesterday. Increased competition in the voluntary sector, contract-based funding and changes in charity law are all contributing to pressures for greater efficiency. One of the issues under examination by the commission is whether recognised standards of efficiency could be established and applied across the sector. Mr Fries, presenting the commission's annual report to an audience of voluntary-sector leaders in London, said the commission was going through changes as profound as any in its 140-year history. The 1992 Charities Act had strengthened its supervisory powers, but it was important for it to use them to support as well as supervise charities. He said: 'The more we can use our powers and skills to help enhance the integrity and efficiency of charities, whether in legal or financial matters, the less it will be necessary to intervene to correct things which have gone wrong.' Mr Fries said evidence showed that difficulties were 'overwhelmingly' the result of maladministration rather than abuse or fraud, and the commission would attempt to act in a preventative way. The new charities legislation has increased trustees' responsibilities and will impose stricter accounting requirements. Computerisation of the commission's register of charities has, for the first time, equipped it to monitor charity accounts effectively. Last year 4,681 new charities were registered in England and Wales but almost equal number of defunct ones - 4,546 - were removed from the register. There were 170,357 registered charities at the end of last year. The commission started 718 inquiries into possible maladministration and abuse last year, an increase of 29 per cent over 1991. Issues under consideration by the commissioners include possible new guidance on the extent to which charities may take part in political activity, a sensitive area where there are few firm legal precedents. A consultation paper is likely to go out to charities soon. The commission is also putting out a warning that a growing practice among some organisations of recruiting collectors by random, unsolicited telephone calls does not meet the responsibility of trustees to main-tain control of fund-raising. Mr Fries, a senior Home Office official who took charge of the Charity Commission last year, is keen to dispel its former remote, supervisory image and develop it into a body working in partnership with the voluntary sector. Value-for-money exercises on the lines of those conducted by the Audit Commission in local government and the National Health Service are a possible future development. Voluntary organisations are in growing need of financial, legal, communications and other advice, a report by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations concluded yesterday. It called on the government, local authorities and other bodies funding the sector to include finance for the development of professional advice in their grants.

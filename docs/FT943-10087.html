			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Independent Whitewater counsel Fiske replaced The Whitewater investigations were thrown into some confusion last night when Mr Robert Fiske was replaced as independent counsel by Mr Kenneth Starr, former solicitor general in the Republican Bush administration. A federal appeals court panel, acting under authority granted when the independent counsel act was renewed earlier this year, ruled it was in the best interest of 'the appearance of independence' that a person 'not affiliated with the incumbent administration' be appointed. Ms Janet Reno, the attorney general, named Mr Fiske, a Republican, as independent counsel in January to much bipartisan applause. In July, in line with the renewed act, she recommended to the court his engagement be continued. The court stressed it was not impugning Mr Fiske's integrity or independence. It made no mention of allegations aired by Republicans in congressional hearings this week that as a lawyer, he had longstanding professional relations with lawyers for President Bill Clinton and his administration that amounted to a conflict of interest. Republican discontent with Mr Fiske had centred mostly on his interim report earlier this summer which said Mr Vincent Foster, the former White House aide, had died by his own hand last summer. He also cleared administration officials of any criminal violations in discussing the case against Madison Guaranty, the bankrupt Arkansas savings bank owned by the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater land development scheme. Two congressional committee have spent the last 10 days grilling officials on Madison. It was unclear last night if the status of these findings would now be called into question. The court order merely gave the new independent counsel 'full power, independent authority and jurisdiction' over the Whitewater affair. In a brief statement Mr Fiske promised full co-operation with Mr Starr and praised Ms Reno for her support. But it seems probable the investigations will now be stretched out. The administration had hoped the Whitewater affair would be over by the time the 1996 election season began. That may now be in doubt. Mr Starr, also a former judge, is currently in private practice in Washington.</p>

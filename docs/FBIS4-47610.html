			<p>SUMMARY:       The South Korean press has recently carried numerous  reports pointing to growing drug problems in the country.  While  large quantities of Chinese-manufactured, nearly 100% pure philopon   (crystal methamphetamine) have reportedly been smuggled into South  Korea, but the South Korean Government is even more concerned about  the increased flow of heroin and raw opium from Southeast Asia and  China.      According to the 26 March KYONGHYANG SINMUN, South Korean drug  enforcement officers arrested 6,773 persons for drug-related crimes  in 1993, an "explosive" increase from the 1992 level of 2,968  arrests.  The paper attributed the large number of arrests in 1993  to a government crackdown on farmers who had backyard poppy gardens.  At the same time, the paper noted that South Korean authorities are  concerned over signs of increased heroin and raw opium smuggling to,  and dealing within, South Korea.  Moreover, in addition to the  heroin and raw opium problem, the government is once again focusing  attention on the philopon problem.  According to the 31 March  KUNGMIN ILBO, recent seizures of Chinese-made philopon raise  questions about the government's claim that crackdowns over the past  several years had brought the philopon problem under control.      According to the 4 April HANGUK ILBO, the Office of Drug  Enforcement is particularly concerned about the flow of heroin into  South Korea from the "Golden Triangle" area and the flow of raw  opium from China.  These drugs are reportedly smuggled into South  Korea around Inchon harbor on Korea's west coast via routes which  South Korean authorities have come to call the "White Triangle"  route.  South Korean authorities reportedly believe that one of  these "White Triangle" routes is a direct one from Southeast Asia to  Inchon, while the other passes through Tianjin, China before  reaching the Inchon area.  According to the paper, heroin and opium  transactions usually take place on the high seas near Inchon and the  illicit drugs are then smuggled into the country on small boats.  Through 1990 there were no government seizures of heroin, but, in  1991, there were three cases involving 3.3 kilograms; in 1992, eight  cases involving 22 kilograms; and in 1993, two cases involving 22.4  kilograms.  In addition, two shipments of cocaine totaling 23  kilograms were reported seized in 1993.  South Korean drug  authorities reportedly believe that they have the problem of  smuggling fairly good control at the airports and harbors, so they  have shifted their main focus to the problem of coastal smuggling.      According to HANGUK ILBO, government drug authorities' biggest  contemporary concern is that drug dealers who once used South Korea  as a transit point are now distributing drugs inside the country.  However, aside from trying to intercept drug smugglers on the  country's coast, the paper observed that the government has not yet  devised any remedies to resolve the problem and urged it to  intensify anti-drug education for the general population.

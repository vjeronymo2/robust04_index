			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading Stock index futures failed to sustain a rally brought about by demand from UK institutions and once again closed below the recent support level of 3,350, writes Joel Kibazo. Having opened at 3,341, the March contract on the FT-SE 100 was actively sold by leading US houses in the first part of the session, leaving it to fall to a day's low of 3,329. It was UK buyers that helped to bring a rally in March and continued demand saw the contract return to trade above its recent support level by mid-afternoon, reaching a peak of 3,359. A poor start on Wall Street led to renewed profit-taking until the end of the session. March finished at 3,338, a small discount to cash and 8 points below its estimated fair value premium to cash which stands at minus 7 on this account. Volume at the official close was 15,714 contracts. Heavy trading in Hanson contributed to an increase in turnover in the traded options. Total volume was 54,400 lots. The FT-SE 100 option saw business of 15,377 and the Euro FT-SE 100 option 1,336 contracts dealt. In the stock options, Hanson led the way with 6,468 lots traded, the February 280 calls being the busiest series. It was followed by Barclays at 2,856 and Tesco at 2,823. Activity in the FT-SE Mid 250 futures contract traded on the OMLX remained low, with a mere 188 lots dealt.</p>

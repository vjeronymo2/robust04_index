			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Michele Kayal: "Central Europe Accelerates Free </F> Trade"]    [Text] The economic leaders of the Czech Republic, Hungary,  Poland and Slovakia pledged early this month to speed up the  liberalization of trade among their countries and create a free  trade zone in less than five years.    A fast-track version of the Central European Free Trade  Agreement (CEFTA) agreed upon in Prague on Feb. 4, commits the  four countries to achieving free trade by Jan. 1, 1998--three  years faster than previously planned.    By that date, tariff and non-tariff barriers for  manufactured  goods are to be lowered or abolished. In just two months, the  CEFTA nations are scheduled to decide upon an expanded list of  goods that will enjoy completely free trade under the fast-track  program.    Certain sensitive areas--including agriculture, textiles,  metals and automobiles--are not addressed in the current plan.  Expert panels are scheduled to begin immediate discussions on  how to resolve these issues.    Agriculture is expected to present the biggest obstacle. The  four countries' trade ministers said they would like to expand  the current list of items slated for completely free trade.    Czech Minister of Trade and Industry Vladimir Dlouhy said  that the group's determination to quickly solve complex  agricultural disagreements signals that the countries are "ready  to start eating this bitter apple."    Keeping in step with the Western nations that recently  concluded trade pacts such as the North American Free Trade  Agreement (NAFTA) and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT), the CEFTA countries said they expect the union to  improve their economies and to help ease their integration into  Europe. Each member country is permitted to sign bilateral  agreements with third countries--Romania and Bulgaria are  primary candidates.    CEFTA was signed in December 1992 by the Czech and Slovak  republics, Hungary and Poland with the goal of creating a free  trade zone for the region's 65 million people by the year 2001.    The agreement began taking effect in March 1993 with the  gradual removal of tariffs from 60 percent of listed items  traded between Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, and 54  percent of industrial goods from Slovakia.    Ironically, trade among the CEFTA countries has shriveled  since the agreement was initially signed. Hungary's trade with  CEFTA countries, for instance, shrank from 12.5 percent of total  trade to just 5 percent.    All four countries negotiating CEFTA are also pressing for  freer trade with Western Europe, where the threat of  anti-dumping proceedings has caused problems in the past.    "The European Union is the main market for us," said  Miroslav  Somol, a deputy minister at the Czech Ministry of Trade and  Industry.    Somol said the republic is particularly anxious to see  changes in the quotas that the Western Europeans have  implemented against Czech steel and textiles.</p>

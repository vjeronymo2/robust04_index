			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / The Full Employment Debate: Companies put low value on high skills Summary of paper by Ewart Keep and Ken Mayhew: Britain's skill problem is at least as much one of low demand for skills as one of inadequate supply. The current employer-led training policy ignores the deep-seated reasons for lack of employer demand. Thus its effectiveness is likely to be limited. It has been a commonplace assertion that Britain is faced with a fundamental choice about the basis on which the economy meets international competition. One significant strand of the official prescription for economic development has embraced a competitive strategy based on high-quality, technologically advanced, flexible production. Coupled with this have been frequent references to the altering structure of employment, the decline of manual occupations and craft-based occupations, the reduction of manufacturing jobs, the rise in demand for technicians, and the growth in white-collar and professional employment. Just how realistic are these presumptions? It is true that there have been significant structural shifts in UK employment since 1945. In broad terms there has been a dramatic decline in the numbers employed in primary and manufacturing industries and a big increase in employment in the services sector and a growth in 'higher-level' occupations. Yet there have also been shifts in the structure of employment that may point to a rather different view of skill requirements in the economy, in particular the growth of small business employment, self-employment and part-time work. Many people assume that the job structures that pertain in professional occupations are also found in other forms of employment. Yet to talk about careers, in any meaningful sense, for many employees is to ignore reality. Training for the majority of process and non-craft skilled workers in many sections of manufacturing industry has traditionally been non-existent. Job security is lacking, opportunities for progression minimal with the current employer, and still limited in the sector. In the clothing industry, for example, the situation is that a typical female machinist enters the industry in her early 20s and retires from the industry maybe 40 years later - as a machinist. Retailing, cleaning, distribution, hotels, food and tobacco, clothing and textiles, catering, and leisure and tourism would be examples of sectors where well-developed career structures frequently do not exist. These sectors employ a significant proportion of the national workforce. In order to progress, workers employed in such sectors must take the risk of changing jobs and employer. Producing high-tech, high-quality goods and services that require high levels of skill is not intrinsically important to a company. The issue of overriding concern is whether its product market strategy allows it to survive and to make adequate profits. If companies can achieve these ends through production of low-cost, low-quality, high-volume goods and services that require minimal skill levels, then there is little reason for them to change strategy. Investment is still seen as a cost, not a benefit by most companies and the cost-benefit information on training is weak. A low-training environment is reinforced by the volatility of the UK economy, the legacy of low-trust industrial relations, and the 'short-termism' of company decision-making. The problem for public policy is that many of the factors determining the low demand for skill come from the internal workings of companies and these remain firmly 'off-limits' to outside influence. One of the few admissions that the internal workings of the company have to be addressed if training policy is to succeed, comes in the Investors in People initiative.</p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Arts: Solti's Bruckner - Concert At the Barbican on Wednesday, the London Symphony played splendidly for Sir Georg Solti in Bruckner and Stravinsky. The latter's wartime Symphony in Three Movements has been a Solti party-piece these many years; not because he does sensational tricks with it, but because he knows how to sustain its sinewy tensions from start to finish. Most performances let them go slack at one place or another; here it never did. A favourite critical epithet for Solti performances is 'hard-driven'; but there is a distinction between forcing a piece like this one violently along, and what he actually did - which was simply to ensure that every rhythmic cell strained forward toward the next, holding our attention taut. A further result was that the 'affirmative' ending felt much more like an honestly earned release than it usually does. The concertante piano and harp were fine; for pungent character, however, it was the first clarinet who stood out. The baritone gurgles that Stravinsky assigned him as punctuation, here and there, were delectably funny and knowing. It was enlightening about Solti to hear him conduct Bruckner's Fourth Symphony, the 'Romantic', just six weeks after Herbert Blomstedt had led his crack San Francisco band through it on the South Bank. That was a hugely efficient performance, but steely and unyielding in effect. Though Solti was as always pretty urgent, and at a generally high dynamic level, his brassy climaxes were never abrasive. If he made less of Bruckner's bosky, evocative intimations than (say) Klaus Tennstedt does, his cooler reading of the Andante was eloquent and most scrupulously graded. Nothing much like Tennstedt's chiaroscuro, but persuasively articulate over a wide, subtly calibrated spectrum: Solti conducted the strictly musical argument with elan. With the San Francisco comparison fresh in mind, one could appreciate the lyrical flexibility of his beat (despite appearances), and his gift for engineering 'spontaneous' dramatic contrasts that did not sound engineered. All those laborious chromatic ascents in the symphony were rendered fluid, where hard-edged American precision had exposed them as mechanical - and he left room for folksy Austrian dance-echoes too, which had been Greek to the San Franciscans. That was nice. Even music of elevated ambitions may trade upon local accents that cannot be translated into standard, cosmopolitan notation. Sponsored by IBJ International plc</p>

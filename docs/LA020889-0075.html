			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The insider stock-trading scandal that has plagued Japanese Prime Minister  Noboru Takeshita's government since last summer claimed its 28th victim: the  chairman of the No. 3 opposition party. Saburo Tsukamoto, head of the  middle-of-the-road Democratic Socialist Party, announced that he will not seek  another term. To continue in the post he has held since 1985, he said, would  damage the party's chances in Parliament elections in July. Last summer,  Tsukamoto acknowledged having made a tax-exempt profit of $77,000 after buying,  at a bargain price, unlisted shares in a subsidiary of Recruit Co. before the  stock went public and the price soared.  </P></p>

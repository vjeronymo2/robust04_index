			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Euro-socialists launch early poll campaign EUROPEAN socialists have launched their campaign to remain the largest political group in the European Parliament - a good seven months ahead of the Euro-poll. Delegates at Saturday's congress of socialist parties in Brussels voted unanimously in favour of a framework election manifesto, apparently happy to run the risk that after such an early start many potential voters may be fed up with hearing about the Parliament by next June's elections. The manifesto - a compromise document which emerged from months of debate and more than 2,000 amendments proposed by the 24 member parties  - pledges to find ways to ease the consequences of recession. In his opening address at the congress, Mr Willy Claes, the Belgian foreign minister and president of the party of European socialists, told delegates that the fight against unemployment was their 'number one challenge'. The manifesto also proposes a broad campaign against war, social injustice, environmental destruction, nationalism and racism. It is the first time Europe's socialists have co-ordinated their electoral campaign. The manifesto was drawn up with the help of socialists from Norway, Sweden, Austria and Finland, which have applied for EC membership. 'Europe's (socialists) can no longer afford to be narrow-minded, with petty national priorities,' said Mr Gerd Walter, European affairs minister for Schleswig-Holstein in Germany, who drafted the manifesto. But in spite of much friendly 'comrading' of one another in the corridors and chamber of Brussels's brand new parliament building at the weekend, it is already clear that some parties will put their own spin on the manifesto once they launch their domestic campaigns. For example, Mr John Smith, leader of the British Labour party, said the Euro-manifesto's recommendation on cutting working time to maintain jobs would not feature in his party's campaign. 'It conflicts with our belief that these are matters for employers and employees,' he said. Mr Claes said it was natural that 'national chapters' would be added 'alongside' the European manifesto. Mr Michel Rocard, the French socialist leader, said he hoped the manifesto would provide a basis for 'convergence' between different views of socialism around the Community. The manifesto throws the full weight of European socialists behind the week-old Maastricht treaty, which gives new powers to the European Parliament, and its objectives of a single currency and a joint foreign and security policy. The manifesto also calls on member states to inject even greater democracy into the new European Union when they consider revising the treaty in 1996.</p>

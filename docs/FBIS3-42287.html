			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 8 Feb (MENA)--Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi  has criticized the statements issued by terrorist groups through  foreign news agencies following any incident. He described  these statements as a sign of bankruptcy, noting that they come  in reaction to the constant security campaigns and the  tightening of the noose around the terrorists. [passage omitted]    Al-Alfi pointed out that there were security shortcomings in  the attack on the showroom owned by al-Sayyid Yahya, the main  witness in the case of the [attempted assassination] of Prime  Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi. He noted that an investigation is now  being conducted by inspection teams from the Ministry of  Interior to determine who was responsible for the security  shortcomings.    Asked if some of those who carried out the attack were  arrested, al-Alfi asked to delay the announcement of arrests of  any suspects, adding that the Interior Ministry will issue a  statement when the time comes to maintain the confidentiality of  information for the sake of the public good.    In response to a question on tightening security around  citizens who give out information to security agencies, al-Alfi  emphasized that those who give information are under protection,  although this is done secretly. He added: If a mistake has  been made in one area, this does not mean that mistakes will  continue.    Asked about the bomb that exploded yesterday in front of the  Central Bank branch in Ramsis Square, the interior minister said  that it was a trivial thing done to prove that the terrorists  are still present.    Asked about the security situation in Asyut, the interior  minister stressed that the situation is completely calm there  and that there is a security presence and that security agencies  are constantly being modernized. The interior minister referred  to the regrettable incident that claimed the life of Brigadier  General 'Umar Hasan Mustafa the day before yesterday, adding  that it happened because of a personal error by martyr Brig.  Gen. 'Umar, who used his private car on his day off without any  guards accompanying him. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Quadramatic maintains its programme with Kestrel deal Quadramatic, the coin-handling and optical group which came to market in July 1993, has continued its promised programme of acquisitions with the purchase of Kestrel Injection Moulders, a maker of precision plastic injection mouldings, for up to Pounds 6.65m. At the time of the flotation, Mr Tony Gartland, chairman, said he wanted to build a specialist engineering group by acquisition. The initial net cash consideration for Kestrel is Pounds 4.4m, after the Pounds 1m sale and leaseback of a Kestrel freehold property to certain of its vendors. An additional deferred amount of up to Pounds 2.25m, in cash or shares, is profits-related. Plymouth-based Kestrel made pre-tax profits of Pounds 855,000 on Pounds 4.19m turnover in the year ended May 31. In the six months to March, Quadramatic made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.72m on turnover of Pounds 17.6m. Quadramatic's flotation was followed in November 1993 by the Pounds 11.25m acquisition of Quota, a private holding company for two high-tech businesses. Mr Glenn Powers, finance director, said originally the group wanted four divisions - hence its name - but that now the building of an equally weighted three was going well. Coin handling remained the biggest, followed by instruments and then plastic moulding. The group would think about a fourth when the market capitalisation approached the Pounds 150m mark. The shares rose 3p yesterday to 168p for a valuation of about Pounds 66.5m.</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Kohl caution over military intervention CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl of Germany yesterday warned that military intervention in former Yugoslavia would not bring an end to the war and could lead instead to further bloodshed. 'A full military involvement, as some are calling for. . . will not bring a solution to the conflict in former Yugoslavia which has historical roots,' Mr Kohl said. 'In light of the chaotic situation in Bosnia-Hercegovina, one can fear a higher death toll for both the civil population and the international military forces there,' he added. Mr Kohl said he fully supported the resolution of the UN Security Council to apply tougher sanctions against Serbia. He also favoured suspending Serbia's membership of international organisations. The chancellor reiterated that, for historical reasons, German soldiers would not participate in military activities in former Yugoslavia. 'The presence of German forces would serve the Serbian war propaganda and would worsen the situation and the international peace efforts,' he said. A Nazi-backed regime was set up in Croatia during the second world war. Germany is prevented by its constitution from sending soldiers to territories outside the Nato area, although Mr Kohl and his party, the Christian Democratic Union, want greater German participation in UN peacekeeping operations. At the weekend, Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister, also warned that air bombardments would lead to an escalation of violence. 'The risks could be incalculable. The situation and the security of Unprofor (UN protection force) soldiers must above all be looked after,' he said. Mr Kinkel also called for the withdrawal of all diplomats from Belgrade.</p>

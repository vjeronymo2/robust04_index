			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRAZIER GETS 6-MONTH BAN FOR WEIGHT INFRACTION  </P> <P> Ricky Frazier, the jockey whose victory aboard Allijeba was erased because of a  weight discrepancy after a $250,000 race at Bay Meadows on Oct. 14, has been  suspended for six months, the stewards at the San Mateo track announced  Saturday.  </P> <P> The suspension, which started Saturday, runs through May 31.  </P> <P> Frazier is currently riding at the Fair Grounds, and stewards at the New  Orleans track, following racing custom, took the jockey off his mounts there  Saturday. Racing has an informal reciprocity rule that prohibits jockeys from  competing anywhere while under suspension.  </P> <P> Fair Grounds sources indicated that Frazier would appeal the suspension to the  California Horse Racing Board, but the jockey couldn't be reached for comment.  Six months is considered to be a severe penalty, but the stewards are believed  to have considered Frazier's previous record, which includes two fines of $100  each for weight violations.  </P> <P> Allijeba was supposed to carry 126 pounds in the Final Fourteen Stakes at Bay  Meadows. When Frazier returned to the scales after a nose victory over Tex's  Zing, the weight was 123 pounds. BILL CHRISTINE  </P></p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: FLS falls 57% to DKr275m NET profits at FLS Industries, the Danish engineering, packaging and aircraft maintenance group, fell 57 per cent to DKr275m (Dollars 44.2m) in 1992 from DKr643m in 1991. A DKr154m write-off for loans to the Hafnia Holding insurance group contributed to the downturn. Group sales were down, to DKr12.08bn from DKr12.49bn, and profits after net financial items fell to DKr365m from DKr673m. An unchanged DKr12-a-share dividend was proposed. The group, which makes about 80 per cent of its sales outside Denmark, said difficult world trading conditions and the strength of the Danish currency hit performance.</p>

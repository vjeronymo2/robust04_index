			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN GIFTS FLOW FROM RICH;  </P> <P> DONATIONS TO CANDIDATES ARE AGAIN UNRESTRAINED AND THE LAW VIRTUALLY  UNENFORCED. SOME OF THE HEAVIEST SPENDERS ARE OVER THEIR LEGAL LIMIT.  </P> <P> Over the past three years, as Congress debated legislation to limit hostile  business takeovers, Texas corporate takeover specialist Harold C. Simmons and  his family pumped more than $250,000 into the campaign coffers of key federal  office-seekers. In the process, Simmons' contributions more than doubled the  legal limit on political giving by the very rich.  </P> <P> Simmons made more than $120,000 in personal contributions to President Bush and  members of Congress who were in a position to influence legislation governing  corporate takeovers.  </P> <P> He gave $59,958 just to candidates seeking election in 1988, more than double  the $25,000 limit. His relatives, after consulting with Simmons, gave to a  similar list of candidates for public office after consulting with Simmons.  </P> <P> At the same time, Simmons proved an effective force in Congress. Campaign  contributions and tireless lobbying by Simmons and others of the nation's  biggest corporate raiders, according to congressional sources, have played a  big role in blocking legislation that would have severely restricted leveraged  buyouts and other hostile takeovers.  </P> <P> While Simmons is a leader among wealthy patrons of the American political  system, he is certainly not the only millionaire who exceeded civil limits  established by a Watergate-era law designed to prevent the rich from exerting  undue influence on the political system.  </P> <P> A Times study, which used computer searches of federal election reports to  focus on the political giving habits of more than 100 of the nation's  wealthiest and most influential citizens, found that at least nine others also  exceeded the legal limit during the 1988 election campaign.  </P> <P> The nine others were corporate buyout specialists Ronald O. Perelman, Meshulam  Riklis and Henry Kravis; Kravis' brother, Raymond; Riklis' son, Ira; Manhattan  developer Donald Trump; grain trader Dwayne O. Andreas, and his wife, Dorothy  Inez, and Caroline Rose Hunt, daughter of the late Texas oilman H.L. Hunt.  </P> <P> Kravis, like Simmons, exceeded the limit by more than 100%, according to  federal records.  </P> <P> When contacted by The Times, spokesmen for each of these rich contributors  acknowledged the accuracy of the records.  </P> <P> "I can't make the problem go away," said John Garrett, Simmons' lawyer, after  reviewing his client's canceled checks and contribution records.  </P> <P> Spokesmen for most of the other nine donors asserted that the violations were  inadvertent. A few pointed out that they had exceeded the limit only by a few  hundred or a few thousand dollars.  </P> <P> These heavy contributors are the sorts of people who have important business  and financial interests affected by decisions made in Washington by officials  they help to elect. So enormous have such contributions become that many of the  congressional recipients of the largess are beginning to worry about the  consequences and to agitate for reform.  </P> <P> "There is too much money in politics; there is too much special-interest  influence," declared Sen. David L. Boren (D-Okla.), who himself has received  thousands of dollars from these contributors and is leading the drive for  reform. "It's an open invitation to corruption."  </P> <P> Ironically, the records suggest, wealthy individuals are giving even more money  to presidential and congressional candidates than they did two decades ago when  Congress enacted a law intended to restrain political contributions by the very  rich.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Example of Donations  </P> <P> The Bass family of Ft. Worth, for example, distributed close to $700,000 to a  variety of candidates for federal office over the past three years -- most of  them defenders of Texas oil interests. Many others doled out contributions of  as much as $100,000 to a single presidential candidate.  </P> <P> The Times review of federal and state campaign records shows that political  giving by the rich is now largely unrestrained.  </P> <P> Even many of those who technically abide by the $25,000 limit seem to have  found other ways to channel additional money to candidates. Some have relatives  who contribute to a similar collection of candidates. Some make so-called "soft  money" -- contributions to presidential and congressional candidates that are  not limited by law because they are forwarded to state political parties for  party-building activities.  </P> <P> Among the givers who used one or both of those entirely legal techniques for  giving more than $25,000 were the Bass family; Hollywood executive Lew R.  Wasserman; Disney executives Michael D. Eisner, Frank G. Wells and Jeffrey  Katzenberg; Chicago industrialist Lester Crown, and several descendants of the  late Texas oilman, H.L. Hunt.  </P> <P> Although Wasserman and the Bass family have been fined in the past by the  Federal Election Commission for their unrestrained giving to political  candidates, FEC officials acknowledge that they do not adequately monitor  compliance with the limits on individual donations. A search through federal  records shows no penalties exceeding $250.  </P> <P> Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, the self-styled citizens' lobby,  said the information uncovered by The Times' study of campaign giving "means  that the laws on the books intended to prevent wealthy contributors from using  large amounts of money to potentially influence government are being ignored."  </P> <P> The FEC's failure to enforce the laws governing donations by individual  contributors demonstrates the need for a massive overhaul of federal election  laws, which is currently being considered in Congress, according to Wertheimer.  He said the FEC does not monitor compliance with the $25,000 limit, and also  has failed to write regulations that would restrict soft-money contributions.  </P> <P> "If we had effective enforcement of the law today, the soft-money contributions  would not be taking place and contributions over the aggregate limit would not  be occurring," he said. "Since the FEC is not doing its job, Congress must  again act to make sure the law means what it says."  </P> <P> The current law, enacted in 1974, was intended to prevent the kinds of  activities that occurred during the 1972 presidential campaign of Richard M.  Nixon. According to public records, Nixon's aides collected contributions of $1  million or more from such rich industrialists as W. Clement Stone of Chicago,  Max N. Fisher of Detroit and Richard M. Scaife of Pittsburgh, Pa. At the time,  those contributions were legal.  </P> <P> Under the law, contributors are permitted to give up to $2,000 to a  congressional campaign, $5,000 a year to a political action committee and  $20,000 a year to a party committee. Total contributions for a single year  (donations in 1989 to a candidate running in 1990 count toward the 1990 limit)  may not exceed $25,000.  </P> <P> Although the FEC has "no legal authority to fine anyone," according to FEC  spokesman Scott Moxley, it can try to negotiate civil fines of up to $5,000 for  unwitting violations and $10,000 for willful violations, but federal records  showed no penalties approaching more than a fraction of those limits.  </P> <P> In violations deemed to be "substantial and willful," Moxley said, the FEC  could refer cases to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution, and the  penalties could range up to $25,000 and one year in jail.  </P> <P> In the 16 years since the law was passed, however, party leaders, candidates  and their rich contributors have found numerous ways to circumvent those  restrictions. The result is a system in which, as Wertheimer put it,  "Watergate-size and Watergate-style campaign money are once again a major force  in federal elections."  </P> <P> Anita Dunn, communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign  Committee, said some contributors may actually be unaware of the $25,000 limit  because the candidates, PACs and parties are not bound by law to remind them  about it. "There's no rule that you have to inform people what the federal  aggregate limit is," she said.  </P> <P> The giving habits of Simmons, Kravis and Perelman vividly illustrate how some  very rich people are eager to fill the campaign coffers of influential  candidates -- especially when their business interests appear to be threatened  by government action.  </P> <P> These three men had a great deal at stake in 1988 and 1989, when Congress  considered legislation that would have made it easier for corporate managers to  fend off hostile takeovers. George Bush, first as a candidate and then as  President, hinted that he might support legislation to toughen the tax  treatment of corporate debt, which is a vital component of most hostile  takeovers.  </P> <P> But both Bush and Congress eventually backed down.  </P> <P> Some members of Congress insist that individual contributions are so small when  measured against their total fund-raising needs that they have little  influence. "I really do not believe that senators are going to be bought for a  $1,000 contribution or for a $5,000 contribution," said Sen. John C. Danforth  (R-Mo.).  </P> <P> But economist Robert Reich of Harvard, among others who closely observed the  process, says campaign contributions from corporate raiders were directly  responsible for dissuading Congress and the President from taking any action  against corporate takeovers.  </P> <P> "Wall Street has been pouring money onto Capitol Hill and both Democrats and  Republicans have developed a strong thirst for it," he said. "All of this is  manifest in Wall Street's extraordinary power and the resolute timidity of  Congress in the face of that power."  </P> <P> Over the past three years, the Simmons, Kravis and Perelman families each made  more than $250,000 in political contributions, most of them to Bush and members  of Congress who were in a position to play a key role in killing any corporate  takeover legislation.  </P> <P> In the House, Simmons gave contributions of between $500 and $1,000 to the men  with the most control over such legislation: John D. Dingell (D-Mich.),  chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee; Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.),  chairman of the subcommittee with direct responsibility for financial markets,  and three other members of the committee -- Mike Synar (D-Okla.), John Bryant  (D-Tex.) and Joe L. Barton (R-Tex.).  </P> <P> While Markey's subcommittee held extensive hearings on the corporate buyout  issue during 1989, it did not draft legislation.  </P> <P> In the Senate, Simmons and Kravis gave contributions of $1,000 to $2,000 to  many members of the Banking and Finance Committees, which have jurisdiction  over corporate finance. Finance Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) received $5,000  from the Simmons family and $2,000 from Kravis for his 1988 reelection  campaign. After publicly criticizing the takeovers, Bentsen announced in March,  1989, that his panel could propose no legislation.  </P> <P> The year before, the Banking Committee sent to the Senate floor a bill designed  to curb corporate takeovers. But Sen. William Proxmire (D-Wis.), then the  committee's chairman, abruptly pulled the bill from the floor after the Senate  voted 57 to 40 in favor of an amendment that would have curbed the use of  so-called "poison pills" by managers to avert outside takeovers.  </P> <P> That pro-takeover amendment effectively killed the bill, and 21 of the 26  senators who had received campaign contributions from Simmons, Kravis or  Perelman over the past three years voted in favor of it. Only five -- John  Heinz (R-Pa.), Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.), Donald W. Riegel Jr. (D-Mich.),  Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) and Paul Simon (D-Ill.) -- voted to protect  poison pills.  </P> <P> While contributing these large sums of money, Kravis, by his own account, also  privately lobbied about 50 members of the House Ways and Means and Senate  Finance Committees, arguing that corporate takeovers generally are good for the  nation's competitiveness. One House member who met with him twice recalled that  Kravis was "very persuasive."  </P> <P> Unlike Kravis, Simmons seldom if ever does any personal lobbying in Washington.  Despite his wealth and phenomenal success, he remains a shy, unassuming  personality.  </P> <P> A poor boy from rural Texas, Simmons, now 58, began his business career with an  investment of $5,000 and built a successful drug store chain that he sold to  the Eckard drug store chain. Then, through a series of corporate takeovers, he  amassed a financial empire currently valued at nearly $2 billion. He recently  lost a battle for control of Lockheed Corp.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lawyers Name Wife  </P> <P> Although FEC records show that Simmons contributed more than twice the $25,000  limit to candidates in 1988, his lawyers assert that $7,000 of those  contributions were actually intended to be donated by his wife, Annette, but  she did not sign the check.  </P> <P> The lawyers acknowledged that the FEC records are otherwise accurate. And even  by their own accounting, Simmons was $27,958 over the annual limit for  political giving set by federal law.  </P> <P> A lawyer representing Simmons said the couple wrongly believed they would not  run afoul of the law if they kept their combined donations under $50,000. "That  may not be the law, but that's the way he does it," Simmons' lawyer said. He  did not explain how Simmons and his wife failed to abide by their self-imposed  $50,000 ceiling.  </P> <P> In addition to Simmons' $59,958 in contributions, federal records show that his  wife contributed $10,750, his two brothers and sister-in-law gave $15,175 and  his four daughters -- three of them still college students -- kicked in another  $51,500. That brought the family's total contribution to more than $137,000.  </P> <P> Like most rich families that make substantial political contributions, all  members of the Simmons clan gave money to a similar list of candidates. Critics  of the current system view this pattern as evidence that individuals such as  Simmons are actually responsible for all the donations. Indeed, according to  party officials, the candidates who receive the money assume it is all coming  from one source.  </P> <P> The parallel contributions of Simmons and his family members are particularly  clear in the case of his three college-student daughters. In 1987, for example,  Scheryle Simmons gave $5,000 to the PAC of one of her father's corporations,  Contran, and another $5,000 to the PAC of the Chicago-based law firm that does  business for her father, Kirkland Ellis. Simmons' lawyer acknowledged that  Simmons and his wife and daughters discussed their contributions before making  them.  </P> <P> While Simmons shuns lobbying, Kravis and Perelman are well known in political  circles, and both clearly enjoy rubbing elbows with Washington's power elite.  Perelman's national reputation soared in 1986 when he acquired Revlon for $3  billion, and Kravis is best known for the biggest takeover in history, the  $25-billion leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. in 1988.  </P> <P> Records show that Kravis, 45, contributed $56,711 directly to federal  candidates and political action committees in 1988, or more than twice the  legal limit. His brother, Raymond, an internationally recognized oil and gas  consultant, exceeded it by giving $34,500. His wife, fashion designer Carolyne  Roehm, contributed another $3,711. Like the Simmons family, the different  members of the Kravis clan gave mostly to the same candidates.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Kravis declined to comment on the FEC records of his  contributions.  </P> <P> Kravis also made a so-called "soft money" contribution of $100,000 to Team 100,  a program run out of Republican National Committee headquarters in 1988 by  Bush's chief fund-raiser, Robert A. Mosbacher, now secretary of commerce.  </P> <P> Although the money was raised by Bush's presidential campaign, it was not  subject to federal limitations because it technically was spent on the state  level by the Republican Party for such things as voter registration and  get-out-the-vote drives.  </P> <P> It is estimated that Bush and his Democratic opponent, Michael S. Dukakis, used  this loophole in federal election laws to raise about $50 million between them  in soft money in 1988. The money is used to supplement the $92.2 million in  public funds received by presidential candidates.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Even Donations  </P> <P> While Simmons and Kravis favored Republican candidates, Perelman, 46, whose  personal wealth is estimated at $2.75 billion, showed little or no party  favoritism in his giving during the last election campaign. His soft-money  contributions were evenhanded -- $100,000 to the Republicans' Team 100 and  $100,000 to a similar fund created by Democratic fund-raiser Robert Farmer for  Dukakis.  </P> <P> According to FEC records, Perelman also gave a total of $30,500 in  contributions that were subject to federal law, or more than $5,000 over the  legal limit. These included $1,000 each to Democratic presidential hopefuls  Dukakis, Joseph R. Biden Jr., Gary Hart, Richard A. Gephardt and Gore, and $500  each to GOP presidential hopefuls Bush and Bob Dole.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Perelman, James Conroy, acknowledged that his boss in 1988 may  have slightly exceeded the limit on contributions subject to federal law. But  he argued that $5,000 of Perelman's $30,500 in donations reported to the FEC  should not be subject to federal law because it was given to the Presidential  Trust, a Republican Party fund, which Perelman mistakenly thought was a  soft-money account.  </P> <P> Another corporate raider, Riklis, 77, the Beverly Hills billionaire who owns  the retail conglomerate Rapid-American and has been in the business of buying  out corporations much longer than Simmons, Kravis and Perelman, also exceeded  the limit on political giving by $1,000 in 1988, according to FEC records.  Riklis' wife, singer Pia Zadora, gave $23,000, and his son, Ira, contributed  $29,500, more than the law allows, to a list of candidates that was similar but  not identical.  </P> <P> Attorney Arnold Brozer said the elder Riklis was under the mistaken impression  the law would allow him to credit a $1,000 contribution to Biden's 1988  presidential campaign to 1987, since that was the year Biden dropped out of the  race. He said Ira assumed that one of his federal contributions -- he could not  remember to whom -- was a soft-money gift outside the purview of federal law.  </P> <P> "It was believed by both Ira and Meshulam (at the time they contributed the  money) that they were not violating the law," Brozer said.  </P> <P> The political giving of the Riklis family does not fit the pattern established  by other corporate raiders. None of the candidates funded by Riklis are members  of committees with direct jurisdiction over legislation affecting corporate  takeovers or the varied business interests of his vast financial empire.  </P> <P> The favorite candidate of the Riklis family was Biden, the Delaware Democrat  who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He received $12,000 in  campaign contributions from the Riklis family during the past three years for  his Senate and presidential campaigns.  </P> <P> Friends say Riklis' son, Ira, is primarily responsible for these contributions.  While a student at Wharton Business School, Ira met with Biden, decided he  liked the Delaware senator's policies and persuaded his whole family to  contribute.  </P> <P> It is not just the corporate raiders who have exceeded the limit on campaign  contributions. The list includes men and women with other interests in  Washington as well.  </P> <P> In supermarket tabloids, Donald Trump is known primarily for his stormy divorce  battle with his wife, Ivana. In New York City, he is known as the owner of  Trump Tower and the Trump Shuttle. But among many candidates for high office,  it seems, he is known as a soft touch.  </P> <P> Federal records show that Trump made $42,300 in contributions subject to  federal law during 1988 and exceeded the federal limit by $17,300. He also gave  $100,000 in soft-money to Team 100, and his family members kicked in another  $13,500 in contributions to various candidates.  </P> <P> Trump's beneficiaries range across the ideological spectrum from liberal Rep.  Ted Weiss (D-N.Y.) to conservative Rep. Jim Courter (R-N.J.). Sources within  the Republican and Democratic Parties say Trump appears to contribute money to  politicians primarily because it gives him an opportunity to socialize with the  nation's leaders.  </P> <P> Anthony Gliedman, an executive vice president of the Trump Organization, said  that when his boss learned a year ago that he had exceeded the $25,000 limit in  1988, he quickly asked for refunds. But Gliedman knew of no refunds received by  Trump, and none of the recipients have reported any refunds to the FEC, as  required under federal law.  </P> <P> Andreas, chairman of Archer Daniels Midland Co., one of the largest grain  trading firms in the world, has long been an acknowledged leader in the art of  influencing government officials. He has been friends with every President  since Harry S. Truman and currently makes frequent trips to Moscow in his  corporate jet for private meetings with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  </P> <P> The grain industry enjoys government subsidies at every level of production and  distribution -- all of them regulated by Congress and the Administration in  close consultation with the big agricultural leaders such as Andreas. Archer  Daniels Midland owes much of its overseas sales to U.S. grain export subsidies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Find Check  </P> <P> Two decades ago, Andreas played an unwitting role in the development of the  legislation that he now appears to be violating. The law was written after  Watergate investigators discovered that a $25,000 check written by Andreas to  the 1972 campaign of President Nixon had found its way into a Miami bank  account of Bernard L. Barker, one of those arrested in the Watergate break-in.  </P> <P> That embarrassing disclosure did nothing to dampen Andreas' eagerness to  contribute money to the American electoral system. To this day, he remains a  stalwart financial backer of the Republican Party and a contributor to many  Democratic candidates as well. In fact, Andreas, a regular churchgoer, has said  he views political giving as an obligation similar to his commitment to  contribute to his church.  </P> <P> In 1988, according to FEC records, Andreas made $28,680 in political  contributions that are subject to federal law -- or $3,680 more than the limit.  Claudia Madding, a spokeswoman, said Andreas inadvertently violated the limit  because he did not understand that contributions to candidates in a  non-election year are attributed to the year in which the candidate stands for  election.  </P> <P> In addition, Andreas' wife, Dorothy Inez, gave at least $27,680 -- or $2,680  over the limit -- to a nearly identical list of candidates. Eight other Andreas  relatives contributed a total of $99,500 to a similar list of candidates.  </P> <P> The Andreas family list of favored candidates is replete with members of  Congress who have big roles in making tax and agriculture policy governing  export and sales of U.S. grain, such as House Agriculture Committee Chairman E.  (Kika) de la Garza (D-Tex.). Andreas also gave a $100,000 contribution to Team  100, the Bush campaign's soft-money fund.  </P> <P> The Hunt family of Texas gave $148,000 in 1987 through 1989 to a list of  candidates dominated by Texas advocates of the oil industry. The leading  contributors in the Hunt family were Caroline Rose, 77, who gave $25,700 in  1988 -- $700 over the limit -- and her half-brother Ray, 47, who contributed  $17,000 plus $10,000 in soft money.  </P> <P> Jim Oberwetter, a spokesman for Caroline Rose Hunt, who runs a chain of posh  hotels, said her $10,000 contribution to the GOP Presidential Trust was a  soft-money donation not subject to federal law. But Republican spokeswoman  Leslie Goodman said all contributions to the Presidential Trust are subject to  federal law. She added that party records show that a letter was sent to Hunt  advising her that the donation was not soft money.  </P> <P> Some wealthy donors, such as Disney President and Chief Executive Officer Frank  G. Wells, say they are meticulous about keeping their political giving within  the letter of the law. In fact, Wells and other top Disney executives use a  computer program designed for them by their lawyers to keep them from violating  the law.  </P> <P> Federal and state records show that Wells, 58, and his wife, Luanne, gave at  least $118,250 to candidates and political organizations over the last three  years, including $50,000 in soft-money contributions to the Democratic Party  and a $5,000 donation last year to the California Democratic Central Committee.  </P> <P> Like other Disney executives, Wells favors candidates supported by the Motion  Picture Assn. of America. These include Rep. Jack Brooks (D-Tex.), whose  subcommittee on economic and commercial law has jurisdiction over many film  industry issues, and California Democrats such as Reps. Howard L. Berman of  Panorama City, Henry A. Waxman of Los Angeles and Anthony C. Beilenson of Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Give to Sen. Bradley  </P> <P> The Disney group also gave generously to the campaign of Sen. Bill Bradley  (D-N.J.), but that was a different matter. Although Bradley serves on the  tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, he is also a close friend of Disney  chairman Michael Eisner and a man whom Disney executives would like to see run  for President in 1992.  </P> <P> Another big Hollywood giver, MCA chairman Wasserman, 76, has also carefully  monitored his contributions ever since December, 1980, when the FEC fined him  $250 for exceeding the $25,000 maximum. His wife, Edith, also gives to  political causes.  </P> <P> Over the past three years, Wasserman has made $72,000 in contributions that  were subject to federal law and his wife has given $37,500, according to FEC  records. In addition, he was among those who gave $100,000 to Dukakis'  soft-money fund in 1988.  </P> <P> Like Wasserman, Texas oilman Perry Richardson Bass, 75, was fined $250 by the  FEC in 1981 for violating the $25,000 limit. Although he said he had intended  that half of the contributions be listed in the name of his wife, Nancy Lee,  there was no record of this. The FEC ruled that in order for a contribution to  be recorded in the name of both spouses, the check or an accompanying letter  must be signed by both. Otherwise, the full donation would be counted as coming  from the individual who signed the check.  </P> <P> The fine did not discourage the Bass family from giving huge sums of money to  political candidates. Bass, his four multimillionaire sons, Sid, 46, Edward,  44, Robert, 41 and Lee, 33, as well as other relatives gave more than $680,000  over the past three years, making them the most generous family in The Times  survey. These gifts included soft-money contributions of nearly $400,000 to  Bush, Dukakis and the Texas Republican Party.  </P> <P> Oil Industry PACs  </P> <P> The Bass family, whose wealth was derived originally from Texas oil, have  contributed primarily to Texas politicians such as Democrats Bentsen, Reps.  Martin Frost and Jim Chapman and former House Speaker Jim Wright, and  Republicans including Sen. Phil Gramm and Reps. Joe L. Barton, Dick Armey and  Lamar Smith. They have also contributed to PACs that advocate the views of the  oil industry.  </P> <P> Although most rich contributors insist that their relatives' giving is  independent of their own, Lester Crown, 64, whose $2-billion financial empire  includes a 22% interest in General Dynamics, readily admits some cooperation  with family members.  </P> <P> The Crown family contributed more than $154,000 over the past three years to a  long list of House and Senate members whose committee assignments give them  jurisdiction over arms sales, such as House Armed Services Committee Chairman  Les Aspin (D-Wis.). Among other things, General Dynamics manufactures the F-16  fighter plane used by the U.S. Navy and many foreign governments.  </P> <P> A Crown spokesman explained that many contributions attributed to Lester in  federal records were actually made by his 96-year-old father, Henry. "His dad  gave the money," explained an aide, "but his father was not available that day,  so Lester signed his dad's check."  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE SIMMONS CLAN  </P> <P> Contributions of the family of Texas corporate takeover specialist Harold C.

			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> French Prime Minister Michel Rocard won a battle with prison guards, who gave  up a weeklong strike, but tens of thousands of civil servants marched in the  capital in another labor dispute. The Justice Ministry said most of the 15,000  prison guards who struck Sept. 27 had heeded a union leader's call to return to  work. Meanwhile, about 30,000 civil servants from the Finance Ministry marched  through central Paris to Rocard's office to press their demands for higher pay  and better working conditions. Also, unions representing nurses, police  officers, firefighters and public transport workers have either threatened  walkouts or staged short work stoppages this week.  </P></p>

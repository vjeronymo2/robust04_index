			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Tesco riposte predicted The bid battle in the food retail sector is expected to take a further twist, perhaps today, with Tesco widely predicted to counter yesterday's Pounds 210m bid from J. Sainsbury for William Low, the Scottish retailer. Analysts were united in the belief that Tesco would return to the fray three weeks after making an agreed Pounds 154m offer for Low. A fresh bid of 350p a share was being mooted in the market, a move which would severely test Sainsbury's staying power in the battle for the Dundee-based grocer. However, others suggestions were of a more cautious 325p a share response. Sainsbury's cash bid is worth 305p a share. Low shares surged forward on the early morning Sainsbury announcement, reflecting the market's instant assumption that Tesco would respond. They closed 44 ahead at 324p with turnover a record 11m. Trading in Tesco was also heavy. The shares retreated 7 to 233p on turnover of 15m, while Sainsbury added a penny at 411p on volume of 4.3m.</p>

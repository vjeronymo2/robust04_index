			<p>BFN     [Text] Defunct U.S. radar installations have permitted  Colombian and Peruvian drug traffickers to once again collect  drugs in the Upper Huallaga valley, from where they "moved" some  years ago when the FAP [Peruvian Air Force] began operations  there.    Proof of this is a seizure by Dinandro [Antidrug Division]  of  537 kg of cocaine base, weapons, and communications equipment on  5 June in Biabo district, Bellavista province, San Martin  department.    Biabo, which is on the left bank of the Huallaga River, six  km from Bellavista, had been free of traffickers.    The traffickers are said to have returned to the area. An  individual known as "Lucho Tulon" might be one of the big shots.    The drugs, weapons, and communications equipment were buried  in three "cellars"--a type of silo--some 500 meters from a house  that had been raided.    This is one of the most important events, following the  seizure of 3,500 kg of cocaine base in Boca Manu, El Diamante,  Madre de Dios, and in Inapari.    Actions by the Army and the Antidrug Division (Dinandro) of  the PNP [Peruvian National Police] in coca producing areas in  Apurimac, Ayacucho, Pasco, and Madre de Dios has helped to drive  traffickers to Upper Huallaga.    As is known, when FAP Tucano planes began operations in  1992,  the interception of Colombian traffickers' planes was  intensified.    Some 200 small planes and civil planes are known to have  been  intercepted in coca growing areas since the start of FAP  operations.    FAP Tucano planes operated from illegal airstrips in the  jungle, helped by the U.S. radar installations in Yurimaguas,  and the Orion and AWACS planes.    As of May, however, the United States suspended radar  operations leaving FAP Tucano planes without classified  information to help intercept traffickers' planes.    The traffickers took advantage of this and have resumed  their  illegal work in the Huallaga region.</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Arts: Manon Lescaut - La Scala, Milan Almost exactly a year after its triumphant premiere in Turin on February 1, 1893 Puccini's opera had a successful run of 19 performances. It was revived in 1909, then dropped until the historic Toscanini interpretation, first heard on December 26 1922 and repeated almost every season until 1929, the year of the conductor's resignation. After Toscanini's departure, productions become rarer; from the end of the First World War until a few days ago there had been only three. So the new Manon Lescaut in Milan was eagerly anticipated. Actually, it was announced over two years ago, for the 1990-91 season, to be staged by Pierre Romans. But the production was postponed and, before he could mount the work, Romans died. Meanwhile, however, his collaborators Denis Fruchaud and Christian Gase had designed, respectively, costumes and sets; so the opera house found itself with the empty shell of a staging, but without someone to fill it with stage life. La Scala appealed to Jonathan Miller, who agreed to take over. It was a generous gesture: few producers with a reputation - and a distinct personality - like Miller's would have been willing to step into another's already defined place, renouncing a priori any thought of total control. In the event Miller's hand was almost nowhere evident. In the first act, the chorus milled about as usual, acting like a chorus; the gamblers, stage left, looked at the conductor and not at their cards. There was no focus, no rapport among the singers, no feeling that anything significant - like falling in love, eloping  - was taking place. In the second and third acts, the staging gained vitality, but still never ventured beyond the most predictable conventionality. What can be done with the fourth act? You imagine the producer saying to the singers: stagger for a while, then drop. The Manon and the Des Grieux at La Scala staggered well beyond the call of duty, and the hero, towards the end, dropped carefully, teasingly just beyond the soprano's reach. I attended the second performance, for which Lorin Maazel's place on the podium had been taken by La Scala's house conductor Armando Gatto. According to reports, Maazel had been booed on opening night after a chilly reading. Gatto began as if he were trying to set a speed record, making the orchestra shrill and nasty. Later, he settled down to more acceptable tempos, but the sound never became seductive. And he allowed the singers to dawdle; rhythms became aleatory. The matronly Nina Rautio has a warm, supple voice, with nothing youthful about it. She sang her second act aria with style and intelligence and, in her death scene, she was - finally  - moving. Peter Dvorsky is a known quantity: big voice, ringing notes, no idea of pathos (his 'Donna non vidi mai' was loud and assertive); but he is a presence. Gino Quilico's Lescaut supplied the elegance that was elsewhere missing; too bad Puccini didn't give him more to do. The sets and costumes looked cheap. In the first act, the chorus all dressed in the same colour - the reddish beige of the set  - draining the scene of precisely the quality it should have: variety. Geronte's mansion was barren, and the Le Havre harbour also seemed unnecessarily sombre. For the last act, a chalk cliff ran along one side of the stage: it made the singers look smaller, but still not moribund.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 442.40&blank;Availability of FFP During Appeals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We proposed deleting &sect;442.40, which presently provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for continuing FFP for up to 120 days after the effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date of termination of a Medicaid provider agreement if an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeal is pending. (See the discussion of comments on part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 431 above.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters wanted to retain the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current provisions which allow for up to 120 days of FFP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during a State's appeal process. A few wanted Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funding to continue until a final decision is issued after a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing. A few stated that elimination of the current rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would provide no benefit to the overall process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As we stated in the proposed rule, it is our  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> belief that the needs of individual residents are best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> served by the availability of prompt and effective remedial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action that will motivate the fastest efforts by providers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to comply with Federal program requirements. The Congress  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has already set the maximum time for a termination at 6  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> months. Because a State could be paid for perhaps as long  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as 4 months after the effective date of provider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination, the State would have no incentive to challenge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NFs to promptly comply with all program requirements. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is because, in all likelihood, the State would continue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funding the Medicaid facility while receiving Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments. If we eliminate Federal funding to the State on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more accelerated schedule, States are likely to stop funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the NF once we stop Federal payments to the State. Thus, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater incentive will exist for NFs to promptly comply with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program requirements. Moreover, because the 120-day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision would significantly delay the imposition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain remedies, it would not be consistent with section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919(h)(2) of the Act, which calls for States to minimize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the period of time between the identification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies and the imposition of remedies. In our  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opinion, the residents will benefit because the facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in which they reside will come into substantial compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> faster. However, for the reasons previously explained, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have decided to continue FFP to ICFs/MR whose agreements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been terminated for up to 120 days after termination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> while we work on the publication of a separate rulemaking on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ICF/MR policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A few commenters stated that if pre-hearings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were provided, the 120 day regulation would not be necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for SNFs and NFs, but that if pre-hearings were not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided, the 120 regulation should be retained in order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> give a facility time to present its side of the story before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suffering irreparable harm.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed elsewhere in this preamble, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are providing for dispute resolution beginning with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider's receipt of the official Statement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Deficiencies, in order to give facilities an opportunity to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rebut survey findings early in the process. By adding this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feature to the enforcement process, we are balancing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needs of facilities to avoid unnecessary disputes and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protracted litigation, on one hand, with the interests of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility residents, which we believe to be paramount, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assuring the most rapid correction of deficiencies. In so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> doing, we believe that the continued application of the 120-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> day rule would upset this balance of interests that we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe the Congress intended us to have.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A few commenters predicted that the courts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be clogged with pretermination or presanction hearings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if FFP were denied during the State appeal procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Post-termination hearings have been upheld  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by all the circuit courts that have analyzed the issue of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether post-termination hearings satisfy the due process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clause of the Constitution (see discussion titled,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Hearings: Medicare and Medicaid Consistency''). Moreover,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we do not believe that the courts will be eager to entertain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legal challenges from providers that have failed to exhaust  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their administrative remedies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We note that the Federal courts are not clogged with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pre-termination challenges when Medicare agreements are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminated and Federal funding ceases on the effective date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of termination. Under both Medicare and Medicaid, 30 days  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of funding will be available, as it is now, to provide a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of time for orderly transfer of residents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

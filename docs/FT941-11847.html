			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Mostly wise on open skies Yesterday's report on the European airline industry by a committee of 'wise men' makes many good points. The committee,set up to advise the European Commission, rightly points out that the industry's financial crisis is due to poor productivity as well as the recession. And it argues that the Commission should press ahead with its open skies policy, which aims to create a competitive market, despite pressure from some flag-carriers and their governments to reverse it. Competition is necessary if flag-carriers are to improve their productivity. So long as they are able to huddle behindmonopolistic barriers receiving drip-feeds of state aid, they will have little incentive to cut costs and restructure. Without a competitive market, Europe's passengers will also continue to suffer from fares which are higher than prices on comparable routes in the US. The wise men also make useful points aboutairport slots and bottlenecks in the skies. If competitors continue to have difficulty gaining access to take-off and landing slots, last year's liberalisationof the market will come to little. Equally damaging are the region's antiquatedand fragmented air traffic control systems. So far so good. The snag is that the wise men spoil their overall report by reluctantly agreeing that further state handouts to financially troubled flag-carriers will be necessary. This is despite their argument that state aid distorts competition and that governments should not intervene for non-commercial reasons in airline operations. The risk of even such a reluctant endorsement of aid is that it could open the floodgates to new airline subsidies. The Commission, which is responsible for policing handouts, is already investigating cases involving Air France and Portugal's TAP. Greece's Olympic, Italy's Alitalia and Spain's Iberia could also be in line. Further disrepute A new raft of airline subsidies would undermine the Commission's open skies policy, as unaided rivals would not be willing to compete with aided flag-carriers. It would also bring Europe's single market, which was badly damaged by the Commission's approval of Ecu7bn in handouts to steel companies last December, into further disrepute. If efficient private enterprises find the playing field tilted against them, they will ask whether there ismuch point in a single market. The wise men recognise this danger and try to guard against it by proposing tough conditions for new subsidies. They say this should be the last time airlines receive aid and that it should be allowed only as part of restructuring plans which ultimately lead to privatisation. The committee also wants the Commission to hire independent analysts to investigate aid cases and then publish their reports. Best guarantee Such conditions ' which many flag-carriers will consider excessively harsh ' are certainlybetter than no conditions. Privatisation would provide the best guarantee that aid was provided on a last chance basis. Meanwhile, publication of independent reports would be a welcome step towards greater transparency. In the past, there have been concerns that the Commission, working behind closed doors, has approved hand-outs by wrongly categorising them as rational investments. But non-aided airlines will ask why the flag-carriers deserve a last chance. The reason, according to the wise men, is that without aid flag-carriers could go bankruptand that would not be politically acceptable. This argument is too defeatist. The banning of aid could be just what is needed to spur airlines into speedy restructuring programmes - cutting staff, withdrawing from unprofitable routes and disposing of peripheral activities. With radical programmes in place, there would be no need for aid, as financial injections could probably be justifiedon normal investment criteria. If the Commission was not willing to oppose aid, it would arguably be in dereliction of its duty under the Treaty of Rome. This outlaws subsidies except in narrowly defined circumstances. Liberal-minded member states should then consider taking legal action to enforce a tougher line.</p>

Although  scheduled to start at 0930, this, the highest trade union forum,  began its proceedings after a 45-minute delay. This was because  of the late arrival of President Berisha, guest of honor at the  congress. Berisha, whose office is a few yards from the Palace  of Congresses where the BSPSh were meeting, entered the hall to  applause, creating the kind of image we had long forgotten --  that of a political leader attending a trade union meeting.  Berisha made his presence all the more strongly felt when he  announced to the floor that he "had followed developments within  the BSPSh with close attention." It is not known whether this  phrase of the president may constitute a warning to the  fractionist group within Xheka's "anticommunist" trade union.  It could be the reason for the head of state's attendance at  the BSPSh Congress. None of the separatists figured in the list  of members of the Presidium who were to chair the plenary  sessions.    Three years after its foundation, the BSPSh finds itself on  the verge of a split. Not even the opening speech made by  veteran trade unionist Llukan Prifti could evoke the old days of  ferment and struggle against communist governments. There were  harsh words about "attempts at division" even in the report on  the BSPSh's three years of work, delivered by BSPSh Secretary  Vilson Qendro. According to Qendro, divisive individuals within  the ranks of the trade union are incited by political parties  who wish to take over the uncompromising struggle that the BSPSh  is waging in the interests of workers. Qendro called them "the  spawn of the dictatorship," and accused them of using "gangster  methods" in their activities. Nevertheless, he did not mention  any names in his speech. According to the report as delivered,  the struggle of the BSPSh is now moving into a new phase. Its  coalition with right-wing parties led to their assumption of  power. The government has now reduced to a minimum its dialogue  with the trade unions and parts of the legislation now approved  can be considered antidemocratic. Meanwhile, according to Vilson  Qendro, the BSPSh now demands wages linked to the inflation  index, an end to lay-offs, and the distribution of national  assets in the form of vouchers.    The first sessions of the BSPSh Congress showed no signs of  these conflicts, which will not, apparently, be made public this  time either. The atmosphere in the hall and Berisha's greeting  encouraging Xheka may finally have tilted the scales in favor of  the present Presidium. The congress will continue its  proceedings today, its second and final day.</p>

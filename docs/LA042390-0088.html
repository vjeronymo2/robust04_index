			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEAVY DUTY;  </P> <P> WEIGHTS AND MEASURES INSPECTORS KEEP THINGS IN BALANCE  </P> <P> Wheeling a shopping cart into a Long Beach supermarket one recent day, Barbara  Sparks could have been mistaken for a grandmother running her usual errands.  Her face framed by bifocals, pearl earrings and graying curls, she headed  straight for the meat counter, pausing to test packages of boneless rump roast,  kielbasa, ground sirloin and salt pork like any choosy shopper.  </P> <P> But in her basket, Sparks, 60, toted a set of precision weights, a  battery-powered digital scale accurate to 1/100th of an ounce and a pad of  yellow violation notices that she would soon dish out.  </P> <P> Sparks, an investigator for the Los Angeles County Department of Weights and  Measures, zeroed in on a honey-cured smoked turkey. The bird, advertised as  3.99 pounds, actually weighed in at just 3.90. Five others also came up short.  Sparks slapped the meat manager with a citation and ordered him to correct the  prices.  </P> <P> Total overcharges: $2.27.  </P> <P> In a world of violence, gangs and drugs, Sparks and the county's 45 other  weights investigators keep consumers from being nickeled-and-dimed to death. "I  know short-weight meat doesn't compare with murder on 2nd Street," said Sparks,  back behind the wheel of her car and off to another market. "But somebody has  to protect the consumer. It all adds up, you know."  </P> <P> She and her colleagues hit the streets every day to ensure that a 16-ounce loaf  of bread always equals a pound, that a gallon of gas isn't an ounce less and  that foot-long wieners truly measure up.  </P> <P> Rarely are weights violations today as flagrant as those depicted in the 1937  film "Great Guy" -- a favorite at weights and measures conventions -- in which  James Cagney played a crusading inspector who busts a butcher for selling  chickens with pieces of lead slipped inside.  </P> <P> But Los Angeles County's burgeoning population and commercial growth has  produced an unprecedented number of packages to weigh, depths to gauge and  sizes to measure. The effects of even minor, unintentional discrepancies --  such as the price of the underweight turkeys -- can quickly multiply.  </P> <P> Last year, weights officials estimate, they saved consumers at least $9 million  in overcharges. They inspected 19,862 commercial scales, 25,711 retail gas  pumps, 1,734 taxi meters and 4,268,448 packaged items. And they handed out  1,510 citations.  </P> <P> "It's just too bad that the majority of the public doesn't realize what we do,"  said Nahan H. Gluck, deputy director of the department and its $1.6-million  budget. "We don't have any funds for PR people, or pet projects, or literature,  or pamphlets."  </P> <P> Lest he despair, Gluck can look to the poster hanging on his office wall for  inspiration: "A false balance is an abomination to the Lord," reads the  biblical passage, "but a just weight is His delight."  </P> <P> To large retailers, supermarkets and gas stations, the weights and measures  inspectors are something of a necessary evil. While few are thrilled by  violation notices, businesses generally say they appreciate the opportunity to  correct their mistakes.  </P> <P> "It makes us aware of the need to be careful," said Steve Koff, president of  Southern California Grocers Assn., which represents 1,200 stores from  Bakersfield to San Diego.  </P> <P> Yet since few violations are intentional -- county officials estimate that 95%  stem from human error -- merchants sometimes complain that inspectors are too  picky and unforgiving.  </P> <P> Take the case of Teresa Baker, a 36-year-old bakery manager snared last year  for selling lemon-poppyseed muffins at less than the advertised weight.  According to Baker, who was then working at a Ralphs in Santa Fe Springs, she  placed the muffins in packs of four, each of which cost $2.59 and was listed at  18 ounces.  </P> <P> But an inspector visiting the store last August discovered 41 containers  weighing an average of 16 ounces. The total overcharges were $12.08.  </P> <P> Baker argued that even at the light weight, the four-packs still were cheaper  than buying muffins individually at 69 cents apiece. A Whittier Municipal Court  judge, however, slapped her with two years of summary probation and fined the  store $235.  </P> <P> "I try to be very conscientious," said Baker, who now works at a Ralphs in  Cerritos. "I wouldn't sell something to the customer that I wouldn't buy  myself. Now this is on my record. It just seems unfair."  </P> <P> Although inspectors don't have to prove that a violation is intentional --  evidence of the error is enough -- there are cases where inaccuracies are so  egregious or far-reaching that prosecutors take the step of filing civil  charges.  </P> <P> In March, 1989, the district attorney's office won one of its biggest such  cases, a $450,457 judgment against the Kmart Corp. for consistently  overcharging at its check stands. Of the 358 products purchased by undercover  agents at Kmart stores in Los Angeles, Kern and Kings counties, 103 were  incorrectly rung up, officials said.  </P> <P> The average overcharge was 11.3%.  </P> <P> In another case several years ago, the Coleman Co., based in Wichita, Kan., was  fined $37,125 for selling 4,008 short sleeping bags at Los Angeles stores.  Although the discrepancies were minute -- most bags were little more than an  inch short -- prosecutors said those bags were the firm's biggest sellers and  they gave Coleman an unfair competitive edge.  </P> <P> "When you see a pattern of negligence like that it raises questions," said  Michael Delaney, head of the district attorney's consumer protection division.  "As a prosecutor I tend to get cynical when they say it's an accident. For some  reason, their accidents usually seem to favor the business, not the consumer."  </P> <P> For years, the weights and measures department, founded in 1915, was able to  inspect every commercial scale in the county. When officials found bogus  devices, they routinely smashed them with sledgehammers and hurled them off of  the Santa Monica Pier.  </P> <P> Today, with more than 20,000 businesses and 7 billion packaged items consumed  annually in the county, inspectors say they are barely able to scratch the  surface.  </P> <P> Officials say they target stores and service stations that have a history of  problems. "We always try to zero in on the places where we're going to have the  highest impact," said Gluck, whose department merged six years ago with the  office of the county agricultural commissioner.  </P> <P> Pity the business that challenges evidence collected by a weights and measures  inspector -- for the firm soon finds itself up against the relentlessly precise  world of metrology.  </P> <P> The weights department's nerve center is an atmospherically controlled  laboratory in South Gate. Under lock and key is a highly polished,  stainless-steel cylinder that weighs 1 kilogram and is known as Los Angeles  County No. 1.  </P> <P> Every time an inspector hands out a citation, the suspected product ultimately  is compared against that kilogram, which is the standard by which all weights  in the county are measured. One kilogram is equal to 2.2046 pounds.  </P> <P> The laboratory that contains Los Angeles County No. 1 has steel walls and its  own foundation.  </P> <P> Due in part to the needs of the aerospace industry, which relies on precise  weight measurements to calculate the thrust of rockets and airplanes, Los  Angeles is the only county in the country to have a kilogram directly modeled  after the U.S. standard, known as Prototype Kilogram No. 20. It is held at the  National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Md., and used  as the country's standard for all weights for the last 100 years.  </P> <P> Even the Los Angeles and Gaithersburg kilograms are mere approximations of the  world's standard of a true kilogram, which is held in a vault in Sevres,  France.  </P> <P> Inspectors have their scales calibrated to the county standard every six  months. Yet despite such precision, their jobs always come down to questions of  judgment.  </P> <P> After totaling up the violations in the meat department of the Long Beach store  she was casing, inspector Barbara Sparks wheeled her cart over to the store's  bakery and began weighing loaves of oat-bran bread, hot cross buns, egg bagels  and apricot muffins.  </P> <P> This time, it was a gooey hot fudge sundae cake that caught her eye. The  chocolate dessert, it turned out, was advertised at 20 ounces, but weighed in  at 19.4.  </P> <P> "It's so close that I won't take the time to write this one up," Sparks told a  visibly tense bakery manager. "But if you make some more tomorrow, maybe you  ought to put on just a little bit more icing."  </P></p>

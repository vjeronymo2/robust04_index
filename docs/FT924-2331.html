			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Arts: Musical stars shine out in the Northern sky - The 'Tender is the North festival' THE TITLE still seems just as silly as it ever did but 'Tender is the North', the Barbican-based celebration of Scandinavian arts, has proved itself one of the most worthwhile and comprehensive of such festivals in London. It all ends tomorrow, when Colin Davis conducts the last concert in his immensely authoritative Sibelius cycle. For its final week, however, the focus of activity switched very definitely to the Scandinavia of today; five concerts of contemporary music selected by the Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho have been given in The Place theatre; the last of them will take place this evening. A decade ago such a survey of new Scandinavian music would have attracted little attention. But the 1980s saw the emergence from northern Europe of a whole cadre of composers in their thirties and forties, all very different in style and approach, who rapidly made distinctive marks. Two of the Finns, Saariaho herself, born in 1952, and Magnus Lindberg (born in 1958), must now be ranked alongside the most important figures of their generation. This northern renaissance has not been at all fortuitous; it had a whole complex of cultural and historical catalysts, though perhaps the most significant of them was the opportunity for young composers from Scandinavia to study abroad and especially to work at IRCAM in Paris. As a result they have mastered a wonderful diversity of musical language, totally without its compositional dogma. It was revealing to see the 20th-century masterworks that Saariaho had included as benchmarks in her programmes; there were pieces by Ligeti, Messiaen, Berg and Takemitsu, all of them free spirits technically speaking, intensely intuitive yet at the same time highly disciplined. Tuesday's opening concert, given by the excellent Finnish ensemble Avanti], conducted by Jutta-Pekka Saraste, was the most prestigious of the series: Ligeti's Chamber Concerto preceded a new work by Saariaho and Lindberg's impressively argued and harmonically lucid Joy, which the London Sinfonietta introduced to London last year. Saariaho's piece, Amers, was a joint commission from IRCAM and the Barbican; it is a cello concerto in all but name, a single 20-minute span. The soloist (Anssi Karttunen here) is amplified: courtesy of IRCAM technology each string of the instrument has its own microphone and the sounds can be diffused independently around the hall. The ensemble contains a pair of synthesisers (generally sampling metallic timbres); there is also a computer-generated tape. The aural benefits of such a highly intricate set-up were not entirely clear at this first performance; a larger space might have given the cello lines more mobility and focus. As it was Amers could be admired for the fastidious selection of its material, the delicately graded and controlled textures, the unexpected harmonic shifts and rhythmic collisions. Each of Saariaho's wonderfully assured works leaves one wanting to hear much more, especially the big orchestral pieces which remain unperformed in Britain. In Avanti]'s second concert on Thursday the modern classic was Berg's Chamber Concerto with Ernst Kovacic and Tuija Hakkila as soloists. This time though the newer pieces preceding it were less convincing. Arne Nordheim's Tractatus set whirling flute figuration against the ensemble in an all too familiar rhetorical way, while Minnewater by the Swedish Bent Sorensen (born 1958) began promisingly with a gently lapping study in closely meshed melodic layers which owed a good deal to Ligeti, but seemed to lose its way in a flurry of rhythmic activity towards the end. Yet the opportunity to hear Sorensen's music was a thoroughly useful one; the whole event at The Place has provided a timely counterpoint to the mainstream events of the festival.</p>

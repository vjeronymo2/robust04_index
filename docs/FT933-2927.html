			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Observer: Living banker Andre Szasz, the seasoned No 2 at the Dutch Central Bank, was in urbane form at a City conference in London yesterday, a gathering which was engaged in examining the EC's exchange rate mechanism one year after sterling's rapid departure. Stoutly defending Bundesbank-style orthodoxy, Szasz expressed support for those ERM members who have not used their new-found monetary flexibility to bring down interest rates faster since August's exchange rate jitters. Signs during the summer that some countries were 'impatient' to lower interest rates themselves contributed to the speculative flurries against weaker ERM members, Szasz said. His comment was taken by some as a direct criticism of Edmond Alphandery; the French economy minister's call in June for Bundesbank interest rate cuts almost immediately sparked pressure on the French franc. Pressed for elucidation, the Delphic Szasz said he would 'never presume' to give Alphandery any advice. Any similarity between persons criticised in his speech and what he called 'living characters' was 'purely coincidental'.</p>

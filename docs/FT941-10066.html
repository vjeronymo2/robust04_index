			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Solicitor breaks the Bar's monopoly The Bar's 200-year monopoly on advocacy in the higher courts formally came to an end yesterday when Mr Richard Slowe, a former barrister, became the first solicitor to exercise advocacy rights in the High Court, Robert Rice writes. Mr Slowe, a partner of City solicitors S J Berwin, appeared before Mr Justice Ferris in the Chancery Division of the High Court as junior to Mr Alan Steinfeld QC in a business expansion scheme case. He was one of 32 solicitors whose applications for exemption from the requirement to take an advocacy training course before gaining higher court advocacy rights was granted by the society yesterday. All 32 have either experience of work in the higher courts as part-time judges, or have formerly practised as barristers. Three solicitors were granted audience rights for civil cases only, 16 for criminal cases only and 13 for both civil and criminal cases. Mr Walter Merricks, the society's assistant secretary general, said he was delighted that 'at long last some solicitors will be able to represent their clients in the higher courts'. More than 1,000 solicitors had enquired about obtaining rights of audience in the higher courts since the profession got the go-ahead from the Lord Chancellor and the four senior judges last December.</p>

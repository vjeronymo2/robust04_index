			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market report GOLD pushed to the day's highs around the Dollars 350 area in late afternoon trade on the London bullion market on renewed fund buying on Comex as the dollar slid to an all-time low against the yen. But producer selling continued to cap the upside, while there was no sign of the rumoured Bundesbank interest rate cut and the French Franc steadied against the D-mark in the ERM. Generally low levels of industrial demand growth in the major economies remained the main depressing factor on BASE METAL prices at the LME. Until this changed it was unlikely consumers would do more than satisfy immediate needs or that investors would be prepared to chase metal prices higher, traders said. NICKEL was steady after its fall to 2 1/2 -year lows earlier this week. But traders believed further losses were likely, and projected a move towards Dollars 6,600 a tonne for three-month metal. However, it was thought that around that level the major nickel producers would be strongly considering production cuts. London's robusta COFFEE closed with pared gains. Prices had been marked up early amid sentiment that some progress appeared to have been made at the ICO talks on a new pact.</p>

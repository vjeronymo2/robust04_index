			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Early gains reduced as rate worries continue - Market report Deepening concern over the interest rate outlook, coupled with a negative reaction in New York to the US payroll data, cut sharply into early gains in UK stocks yesterday. British government bonds fell in late dealings as US Federal bond prices weakened and a leading US investment bank was believed to have turned negative on interest rate prospects in Germany. Once again, UK shares displayed considerable volatility, with the stock index futures traders often influencing the underlying market. Selling of the water industry and electricity generating stocks took its toll of the second-line market indices. Market strategists remained confident that the stock market could resume its upward trend. But this confidence was tested by suggestions by some analysts that the question of a pre-emptive rise in UK base rates may be raised at this week's meeting between the chancellor of the exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England. With gilts fairly steady in early trading, the FT-SE 100 Index was able to gain nearly 26 points after a slow start. Share prices were helped by the technical reaction from the large selling programme of the previous session, which is thought to have involved a switch of as much as Pounds 800m out of equities and into gilts. New York's immediate response to the modest rise payroll numbers and stable unemployment rate in August was favourable but a gain of 13 points on the Dow began to melt away as Federal bonds eased. By the time London went home, the Dow was 3 points off. The turn down in New York hit hardest at UK government bonds. Short dates, closely linked to base rate prospects, slipped by  1/8 in late trading, while the longer dates extended early gains to show total losses of just over a full point. The gain on the FT-SE 100 Index was whittled away to only 6.2 at the close, for a final reading of 3,222.7. But the weakness in the second half of the session fell more harshly on the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, finally down 13 points at 3,781.3. Over the week, the Footsie 100 Index has fallen by 42.4 points, or around 1.3 per cent, as profits have been taken following the powerful advance of the previous five trading sessions. Growing belief that the global interest rate cycle is on the turn have increasingly unsettled markets. However, with the focus on the blue chip market leaders, last week's fall in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index has been held to around 0.6 per cent. About 60 per cent of yesterday's Seaq-reported trading volume came in non-Footsie stocks, which includes many of the utility stocks. On Thursday, retail, or genuine customer business, in UK equities topped Pounds 1.65bn, one of the better daily totals for the year; this figure bore out reports of a trading programme involving switching out of blue chip stocks. Traders stressed that UK and continental European securities houses were striving to keep their trading books flat yesterday afternoon to avoid getting caught with large open positions until Tuesday, when the New York markets return from the Labor Day holiday. Next week is expected to bring a general return to full trading in Europe as the August holiday period is finally left behind. The UK market fears that indications this week of economic recovery gathering pace in Germany and elsewhere may imply that the interest rate cycle could turn upwards sooner than investors had anticipated. However, UK stocks are expected to continue to benefit from the higher company earnings and dividends which have been spurred by the recovery in the domestic economy.</p>

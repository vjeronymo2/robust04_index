			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: French privatisation Whether BNP's offer price is objectively cheap or not, both French private investors and international fund managers clearly seem to think so. The scramble for BNP's shares will help create a suitably frenetic psychological climate. Tax benefits and loyalty shares will provide more material incentives for domestic investors. Foreign fund managers may grumble they have been unable to buy meaningful shareholdings. But it was always the government's intention to treat them mean and keep them keen for subsequent issues. The French government is either being astonishingly nave or extremely sophisticated in this approach. Arguably, giving away too much premium now will only depress the prices achievable for forthcoming issues. But maximisation of revenue is not the government's sole priority. It has broader aims to encourage wider share ownership and develop France's securities markets. Moreover, it could reckon that what it loses now can be made up later, in the same way as the UK government achieved a strong price for the third tranche of BT shares. The trouble with this theory is that investors may prove smarter than the government anticipates. Of necessity, the privatisation programme has had to be front-loaded with attractive assets most likely to appeal to foreign fund managers. The government, though, may receive a nasty shock if it subsequently aims for fatter prices on less appealing propositions like Bull and Air France.</p>

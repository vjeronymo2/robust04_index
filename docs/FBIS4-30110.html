			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Thai finance officials have been instructed to  put the U.S. dollar on the priority watch list after falling  against the yen over the past two days, hitting at one time the  post-World War 11 record low of Y99.85 on the New York market.    Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin said, "The U.S. dollar  has just started to slip; we need to monitor it further."    He added, "If this is only a short-run development, there  won't be much impact. But if it is a long-run problem, there  might be a lot of ramifications. I have urged officials to  closely monitor the development."    Currency analysts said the fall of the U.S. dollar is not a  surprise, but the depths it has reached are indeed low, because  the U.S. and Japan have failed to settle their trade disputes.    They said the jitters over the U.S.-Japan trade talks has  been accentuated by repatriation of the yen by Japanese  corporations, who are selling the dollar for yen on the belief  that the economy back home is recovering.    "If U.S. dollar is weakened over a long period of time,  there  will be significant impact on the baht. But there is an  advantage: a large chunk of foreign debt is dominated in U.S.  dollars, we might seek to refinance such loans," a ministry  source said.    "In our own fiscal position, we are ready for that. It is  also the policy of Finance Minister Tharin who wants to seek  early repayment of existing loans," the source said.    The baht also appreciated sharply against the U.S. dollar,  to  the highest level in four months. The mid rate was fixed at  Bt25.05 per dollar, while the Exchange Equalization Fund bought  the dollar at lows of Bt24.95.    The ministry source added that there had been high  volatility  in the U.S. financial market. "The U.S. authorities might not  want the dollar to be too high. And it is expected that the  Federal Reserve may not raise interest rates too high," the  source said. Higher interest rates would make the dollar more  attractive on international markets.    "The Fed might not want to raise interest rates further  because the U.S. economy has just recovered; and world economic  growth has been at just 2.5 per cent," the source said.    The benefits of early repayment of dollar denominated loans  is not expected to be significant, as Thailand loans are  equivalent to only five per cent of its exports, the source said.    As there is more volatility in the foreign exchange market,  the swap premium has risen by three per cent to nine per cent,  according to a trader at Standard Chartered Bank.    Importers are to pay higher forward rate. The forward rate  for one month ahead is BtO.10 a dollar, for two months it is  BtO.26 and for three months BtO.41.    Exporters get a premium of BtO.09-BtO.10 a dollar for one  month, BtO.24-BtO.26 for three months and BtO.42-BtO.44 for six  months, the trader said.    The recent weakening of the U.S. dollar has not created any  sense of panic in the local market. Most participants are  watching the markets in London and New York to see if the  monetary authorities will step in and intervene. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / MPs split on week's damage to Major Tory backbenchers were sharply divided yesterday over the impact of this week's Post Office retreat on Mr John Major's personal standing. Some rightwingers declared openly that the climbdown had further undermined the prime minister's authority. Others joined the rebels who blocked the privatisation plans in suggesting that ministers could yet turn the situation to the government's advantage. Some MPs felt that Mr Major's handling of the recent sleaze allegations had been much more damaging. Mr Bill Walker, MP for Tayside North, said the situation after the climbdown was 'desperately serious. It is much more serious than just a loss of face - it will affect party morale and party determination'. He added: 'It hits right at the heart of what our policy has been in all our years in government. Either we believe in what we do or we don't' Asked whether he thought the retreat had increased the chance of a challenge to Mr Major's leadership next year Mr Walker said: 'It has undermined the prime minister's authority and the authority of the cabinet. That can only lead to demands for change.' Another rightwinger predicted that if the party was still 'on the shoots' in six to 10 months backbenchers would start panicking. In such circumstances a new man might 'strike a chord' with the public. Sir Keith Speed, MP for Ashford, who opposed the planned privatisation, said he thought the government could 'turn this into a very positive thing indeed'. He said: 'I don't take the view that this is yet another nail in (Mr Major's) coffin. I don't actually think it weakens him at all.' Mr Richard Shepherd, the Euro-sceptic MP for Aldridge Brownhills, said the prime minister should be 'more relaxed' about the climbdown. 'I think he can make a virtue of it.' But he said the handling of the recent allegations of ministerial impropriety had prompted 'grave doubts' about Mr Major's standing in some parts of the party.</p>

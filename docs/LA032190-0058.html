			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CUTLER FINDS HIS PLACE IN SUN WITH 'RAINDOGS'  </P> <P> For Mark Cutler, making an album was a dream too long deferred.  </P> <P> He had been primed since the early 1980s, when he began weaving excellent rock  'n' roll in a small domain -- Rhode Island -- hoping that the bigger world  would take notice and give him his chance.  </P> <P> Finally, last year, the chance arrived. After fruitless and increasingly  frustrating years as singer, songwriter and lead guitarist of the Schemers, one  of those classic regional bands whose number never gets called in the great pop  lottery, Cutler finally had found his ticket.  </P> <P> His new band, Raindogs, had the sort of intriguing pedigree and unusual musical  premise that was bound to draw attention.  </P> <P> The Boston-based band -- which opens for Warren Zevon tonight at the Bacchanal  -- began with a bassist and drummer, Darren Hill and Jim Reilly, who had played  together in the New Orleans band, Red Rockers.  </P> <P> Transplanted to Massachusetts, they decided to form a folk-tinged rock group  that would reflect Hill's Louisiana roots and Reilly's Irish background (Reilly  also played in the Belfast punk group, Stiff Little Fingers). In a fortunate  accident, they stumbled upon Scottish fiddler Johnny Cunningham playing off by  himself in a pub across the street from their Boston apartment.  </P> <P> Cunningham was well-known in traditional folk circles for his work with the  Celtic bands Silly Wizard and Relativity. But after hitting it off with Hill  and Reilly, he bought into their dream of making Celtic sounds that rocked.  Raindogs set about wooing Cutler as their songwriter and front man. He joined  early in 1987, and later recruited Emerson Torrey, his long-time guitar partner  from the Schemers, as the fifth Raindog.  </P> <P> The result of all this multinational chemistry is a rock band that takes  Cutler's root sources -- the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan and Hank Williams -- and  transplants them on Wuthering Heights. Cunningham's highland fiddle darts and  soars and twists, lending new dimension to Cutler's melodically inventive  guitar rock. That sometimes sweet, sometimes stormy backdrop supports Cutler  songs about the moral choices that await us at every turn -- the  disappointments and derailments, the aspirations and unsatisfied hungers that  make living such a precarious but involving business.  </P> <P> By last May, signed to Atco Records, Cutler and the other Raindogs were in a  New York City studio with Neil Dorfsman, producer of Dire Straits' "Brothers In  Arms," one of the most successful albums of the 1980s.  </P> <P> Cutler was about to have his dream un-deferred in a big way. And then one of  those stubborn moral choices he was always singing about popped off the lyric  sheet and into his life.  </P> <P> Early work on the album was not going well, Cutler, 32, recalled in a recent  phone interview from a tour stop in Dallas.  </P> <P> "(Dorfsman) started hinting about wanting to bring other musicians in. It was  obvious he didn't think of us as a band" with a group personality that wouldn't  brook the use of studio aces as pinch hitters.  </P> <P> That left Cutler in a dilemma. His own career album sales stood precisely at  zero. Dorfsman, with a proven platinum touch, was telling him that by bringing  in some polished outside expertise, he could have a hit.  </P> <P> In the end, Cutler said, one of the veteran musicians whom Dorfsman was  thinking of bringing in, drummer Anton Fier, talked to all the Raindogs and  laid out the moral choices in stark terms.  </P> <P> "He said, 'Mark, it's up to you whether you want to be famous and feel terrible  for a few years, or stick up for your band.' "  </P> <P> Cutler decided to stick up for the band. He placed a call to Atco, telling  company bosses that the label's untested new band wanted to fire its proven,  blue chip producer.  </P> <P> Label head Derek Shulman was unruffled, Cutler said, and simply recommended a  new producer, Englishman Peter Henderson, whose best known credits included  Rush and Supertramp, two bands that had nothing in common with Raindogs.  Recording at an inexpensive studio outside Boston, Raindogs finished its debut  album, "Lost Souls," without further incident.  </P> <P> "Lost Souls" never minimizes how painful it is to be playing out the innings of  an unfair game. Even when Cutler tries to invoke a sense of home and hearth, on  the countrified, splendidly melodic "This Is The Place," he starts thinking  about the ghosts that haunt the tenement neighborhood he regards so fondly.  </P> <P> With "May Your Heart Keep Beating," Cutler says he set out to write an  affirmative benediction for the whole world: "May your heart keep beating, may  your pulse stay strong/May you run for miles, may your life be long." But in  creeps the uneasy, all-too-realistic clincher line that undermines those heroic  hopes with a sense of life's inevitable frustration: "I used to run for miles  myself."  </P> <P> "You have to throw a little of the pain in there," Cutler said with a laugh.  </P> <P> Singing about such matters as moral crises and the nature of creative  inspiration is not the conventional ticket to success in the music business.  Cutler said he sometimes wonders whether his songs are too philosophical or  abstract.  </P> <P> "That always occurs to me. You do have doubts, 'Am I getting too heavy here?' I  ask the guys in the band and they say, 'Yeah, it's heavy, but it's good."'  </P> <P> Raindogs open for Warren Zevon tonight at 8:30 at the Bacchanal, 8022  Clairemont Mesa Blvd., Tickets: $16.50. Information: (619) 560-8022.  </P></p>

			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Books: Still alive in Old Delhi CITY OF DJINNS: A YEAR IN DELHI by William Dalrymple HarperCollins Pounds 16.99, 352 pages ASK INDIA hands, old or new, which of the four great cities of the subcontinent they prefer, and the response will be mixed. Most will plump for the zingy, non-stop, rags-and-riches city of Bombay. Some will prefer the more traditional southern rhythms of Madras, others the intellectual and artistic predelictions of Calcutta. Few are the Indophiles, though, who will show affection for the city that sits baking on the dusty north Indian plain, Delhi. It is not only a disagreeable climate that breeds indifference to the Indian capital. Modern-day Delhi is not a city of much grace, subtlety or culture. The centre of one of the world's largest state administrations, this is a town of politicians, bureaucrats, of naked ambition, venality and grasping materialism. Nor does the physical management of the city inspire great admiration. In its race to modernise, the Moslem buildings and monuments of Old Delhi have become neglected and decrepit. In New Delhi the architecture of the British Raj remains, but is increasingly overshadowed by the spread of concrete and high-rises. For most ordinary observers Delhi's abandonment of the past and its gaudy embrace of western modernity have made it just one more over-crowded third-world city. William Dalrymple, though, is not an ordinary observer. It is a measure of his enthusiasm for history that he is able to simply ignore much of the dross of present-day Delhi; by concentrating on remnants of the past he manages to present in City of Djinns a sympathetic and intriguing portrait of this age-old city. With In Xanadu, the bestseller that he wrote in 1989 at the age of 22, Dalrymple took us from the Levant across central Asia to Beijing, an attractive blend of amusing traveller's anecdotes and scholarly historical observation. In limiting itself to describing a single city Dalrymple's second offering will not have the same wide public appeal as his first. Yet in one sense City of Djinns is a travel book, too - the route is not geographical but, using the same blend of anecdote and erudition, takes us ever further back in time. Sub-titled 'A Year in Delhi', the book describes the first 12 months that the newly-married Dalrymple spends in Delhi as a foreign correspondent. Far from focusing on Delhi daily life - much less Delhi political life - the book concentrates on Dalrymple's real interests - the Moslem world and the 900 year period in which India was ruled from Delhi by a succession of Moslem dynasties, each one more eccentric and picaresque than the last. Pursuing his historical research across the city, particularly in the narrow alleys, mosques, abandoned ruins and tombs of Moslem Old Delhi, Dalrymple encounters a range of characters who continue, despite modernising pressures, to give Delhi a special character. Pigeon fanciers, Sufi mystics, Moslem healers, musicians, calligraphers, philosophers and a guild of transvestites all provide Dalrymple with entertaining insights into the lesser-known life of present-day Delhi. Each encounter, though, provides the peg for the real meat of the book, an historical exploration of the city. Beginning with Mrs Puri, his Sikh landlady, and her arrival in Delhi on the great wave of Punjabi refugee immigration at Partition in 1947 - 'it was as if Bloomsbury were made to absorb a deluge of mud-booted Yorkshire farmers' - he looks at the shocks that time and again have transformed the city. He has ample material to work with - over the centuries Delhi has been razed to the ground and born again at least eight times. Dalrymple looks fondly at declining pre-1947 Moslem Delhi, 'the grandest of grand old aristocratic dowagers', as it was before it became Punjabi dominated - 'all show and vulgarity and conspicuous consumption.' He shows us the broad ceremonial avenues and imposing buildings of Lutyen's 20th century New Delhi, at the the same time 'patronising and authoritarian' and 'the finest cultural artifact created by the British Empire.' His gaze at colonial India stretches back through the Victorian age and Mutiny to the wild exploits of the first colonial adventurers and administrators in 18th century Delhi. Dalrymple is fascinated by the pageant of imperial rule in the city, but he reserves his full enthusiasm not for British empire but for its much longer-lived and more colourful predecessor, Moslem empire. From the 'Twilight', the century of Moslem decline that preceded the Mutiny, backwards to the glory days of the Great Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, and still further to the first Moslem invasion of India in 1192, Dalrymple follows the fortunes of some of history's most colourful and unprincipled rulers. There is nothing dry about this history. Besides describing the wealth, military skill and political cunning that kept these cruel autocrats in power, there are tales of imperial orgies, atrocious tortures, assassination attempts, love affairs, spies, palace coups, magic, court poetry, whirling dervishes, fratricides and patricides. Where else could you find a knowledgeable account of the nature and role of the eunuch in medieval Asia? It is all fine, entertaining, well-written stuff, thoroughly researched but with none of the stern, academic tone that so many historical profiles adopt. What sustains it, apart from his erudite knowledge of Moslem architecture, medicine, music, military principles, and arcane religious practices, is Dalrymple's sense of historical adventure. Just open your eyes, he says. If you know how to look, even the empty tombs and abandoned ruins of the past are alive.</p>

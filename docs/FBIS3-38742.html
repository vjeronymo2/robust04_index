			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Baroness Lynda Chalker, UK minister of overseas </F> development: "So Let's Debate the Aid Business"]    [Text] The last few weeks have seen a lot of comment on the  British aid programme. Good, I want people to know what we do  with taxpayers' money. But a lot of the comments have been  inaccurate, indeed positively misleading.    I am not going to go into detail here on the Pergau  [Malaysian dam] project. The Government stands by its decision  to proceed with it. The Commons Select Committee on Foreign  Affairs is conducting an inquiry. The Government will  co-operate fully.    Let me tell you the reality of British aid. The real focus  of British aid --during my time and before -- has been to help  the poorest countries to raise the standard of living of their  people. Especially their poorest people . To get out of the  awful grind of poverty. To avoid that 10-mile walk to get clean  water. To give people the chance of an education so that they,  and their children, can live a better life than their parents.  To give people access to those services that we take for  granted, such as health care and education. Most of all, it is  to give people choices over their own lives and their children's  future.    Some 80 percent of British bilateral aid goes to the poorest  countries of the world. All that aid is on grant terms -- none  of it has to be repaid. The purpose of our aid is to help to  put these countries and their people in a position to help  themselves. We help their economies and we help the poorer  people direct.    And it works. I have seen for myself water being piped into  villages in Nepal. Water schemes where, for an expenditure of  just 20 pounds per person, villagers who previously had to  trudge across the hills for hours in search of water can now  turn on a tap in their village. In poor countries the rate of  infant morality has nearly halved over the past 25 years. Life  expectancy has increased. Literacy rates have risen. British  aid has been part of this.    And we help the vital process of establishing democratic  systems and market economies in East and Central Europe and the  former Soviet Union. Last year nearly 150m pounds of our money  was spent through non-governmental organisations (NGOs). We  have increased tenfold in the last decade our help to the NGOs  through the Joint Funding Scheme.    The aid programme also helps io alleviate immediate  suffering; 12 percent goes on humanitarian aid to countries such  as Bosnia -- money that is spent on food to keep people alive in  the terrible, tragic enclaves of Srebrenica and Gorazde. In  Somalia we give food for those struggling to rebuild their  economy after years of bitter civil war.    But let us not shy away from the fact that aid is part of a  relationship; part of bilateral relations between countries;  part of Britain's relationship with the world; part of  international trading and financial systems. The problems faced  by the developing world are not problems for them over there as  opposed to us over here. The problems confront us all.  Political stability, greater prosperity, the reform of the  international trading system, and the improvement of the  environment in which our children will be brought up -- these  are all issues that affect us equally. Aid is a part of them.  And that is why it has so many facets.    Our priority objectives are straightforward. To promote  economic reforms and sustainable growth, to promote good  government, poverty reduction, human development, to improve the  status of women, and to tackle environmental problems.    These objectives are all in the long-term interests of  Britain. We need a more stable, prosperous, open world economy.  Many of the most effective ways of helping achieve these  objectives also help Britain in a more immediate way. Our  membership of organisations such as the World Bank gives British  firms the right to bid for their contracts. The contracts we  win are, in fact, worth more than the money we put in. And it  is right for us to use the expertise and skills of consultants  and companies, along with volunteer agencies, to help run our  projects and programmes.    Much of the criticism I read and hear has been directed at  the aid and trade provision (ATP). Anyone would think that this  was the aid programme. In fact, in 1992/93 it accounted for  less than 5 percent of the aid programme -- a little in excess  of 90m pounds of a total of more than 1.9bn pounds. By  comparison, in the same year we spent 290m pounds on  humanitarian assistance. Since the aid and trade scheme was  invented -- by a Labour government -- 272 projects have been  approved. They cost 1.4bn pounds of ATP and have brought export  business of 3.9bn pounds.    You have all seen the allegations that we are distorting our  aid programme to secure arms contracts. Let me be clear. We do  not -- and, while I am the minister responsible, will not --  link our aid to the sale of arms.    We have the sixth largest aid programme in the world. We  give a higher proportion of our aid to the poorest countries  than other major donors. Our record on humanitarian aid is  second to none. The professionalism and impact of our work in  health and population, in education, in slum improvement, in  forests -- I could go on -- are widely admired.    The Development Assistance Committee -- the club of donors  which judges its members -- has praised the effectiveness of  the way the programme is run. We are leaders in pressing for  solutions to the debt problems of the poorest countries. We  press for better government, for respecting human rights, for  sustainable economic policies. These are the issues to which we  do link our aid.    The British aid programme involves taxpayers' money. It  should be widely debated. But let the criticisms be based on  fact, not on mischievous and half-baked lies and distortions.  The Overseas Development Administration is not in the arms  business. We are in the business of helping people to help  themselves to grow and develop sustainably.</p>

			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UC IRVINE HITS ROCK BOTTOM IN LOSS TO SAN JOSE, 75-69  </P> <P> UC Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan stood, hands on hips, in front of the Anteaters'  bench trying to make sense of what was happening at the Bren Center Thursday  night.  </P> <P> Ten minutes after watching San Jose State pull away for its first Big West  Conference victory in 18 games, Mulligan still couldn't believe it.  </P> <P> Irvine hit bottom with a 75-69 loss to San Jose before 2,017.  </P> <P> "Right now we're the weakest team in the league, no question about it,"  Mulligan said.  </P> <P> Irvine falls to 2-9 overall, 0-2 in Big West play. San Jose is 4-7, 1-1.  </P> <P> Andre Brooks, one of 15 newcomers Coach Stan Morrison has brought in, had a  game-high 22 points to lead San Jose.  </P> <P> Brooks had 11 of his 22 points in the first seven minutes of the second half to  push San Jose into the lead, 48-44.  </P> <P> The lead had gone back and forth until then. Irvine led, 34-33, at halftime,  only the third time this season the Anteaters had the lead after 20 minutes.  </P> <P> Irvine made one late run at San Jose, erasing an eight-point lead but couldn't  take the lead after tying the score, 59-59, with 4:17 left.  </P> <P> Tom Desiano, who added 12 points, made six free throws in the final 1:05 as San  Jose held on.  </P> <P> Ricky Butler led Irvine with 17 points. Justin Anderson and Jeff Herdman had 12  each.  </P> <P> Irvine shot a season-low 36.9% from the field, 53.8% from the free-throw line  and had 20 turnovers.  </P> <P> "I think we're headed for the cellar this year," Butler said. "Everyone's  looking at us as a win."  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 65-YEAR-OLD POLICE STATION HIT BY FIRE  </P> <P> A fire at the old Northeast Police Station in Highland Park damaged vintage  wooden furnishings but will not delay plans to renovate the historic station  and turn it into a police museum, said the president of the Los Angeles Police  Historical Society.  </P> <P> About 65 firefighters battled the blaze, which broke out at 1 a.m. Monday in  the station at 6045 E. York Blvd.  </P> <P> No injuries were reported, but firefighters estimated the damage at $100,000,  Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Greg Acevedo said.  </P> <P> The cause could not be determined immediately, and an arson investigation was  begun, Acevedo said.  </P> <P> The 65-year-old station, which was designated a city landmark, has not been  used by the Los Angeles Police Department since 1983. A bond measure approved  earlier this year is expected to provide funds for earthquake reinforcement and  asbestos removal.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council has approved plans to lease the building to the  Los Angeles Police Historical Society for use as a police museum. Police Sgt.  Richard Kalk, society president, said the fire apparently caused no major  structural damage.  </P> <P> But Kalk said the blaze destroyed some interior wood paneling, desks and the  reception counter, all of which must be rebuilt. "We want to restore it back  the way it was in 1925," he said.  </P> <P> Kalk said his group had planned to install an alarm system in the station this  week because of continuing vandalism problems.  </P> <P> "We didn't get there in time," he said.  </P></p>

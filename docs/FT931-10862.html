			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / The German Rate Cut: Reserve cut bonus for banks - Impact in Germany THE cut in reserve requirements announced by the Bundesbank will bolster German banks' profits this year, allowing them to earn interest on DM32bn (Pounds 13.3bn) of their deposits for the first time. The Bundesbank's move to replace the reserves with new short-term money market instruments was also seen in some quarters as a boost to Germany's underdeveloped money markets. German banks have long complained that minimum reserves make Frankfurt uncompetitive against other European financial centres. The Bundesbank said the move was designed to increase the competitiveness of Finanzplatz Deutschland, Germany as a financial centre. The reserves require that for every DM100 a bank takes as a deposit from a customer, it is obliged to deposit up to DM12 with the Bundesbank. The banks are not paid interest on these holdings so the reserves act as a brake on lending, liquidity and profitability. Some other European financial centres have these reserves but they are invariably lower. In Luxembourg, a source of strong competition to Frankfurt, there are no reserve requirements. Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands have no reserve requirements, while in France they are just 1 per cent on most bank deposits and in the UK they are 0.35 per cent. The Bundesbank said it would reduce reserve requirements on time liabilities and savings deposits from an average of 4.5 per cent to 2 per cent. Other types of deposits - namely sight liabilities where reserve requirements can be as high as 12 per cent - are not affected. Almost three quarters of deposits at German banks are affected by the measure. The immediate impact is that banks will be able to earn interest on about DM32bn of cash for the first time. If customers do not require them to pass on some of these reduced costs of making a loan, this means an increase of several percentage points in banks' earnings this year. The Bundesbank has arranged it so that the liquidity effects of the move will be neutralised by the introduction of new short-term investment instruments which are intended to absorb DM25bn of the cash. The net DM7bn of new liquidity is too small to have any effect on money market interest rates. Although the Bundesbank has defended reserve requirements as an important part of its anti-inflation armoury, the fact is that they have remained unchanged since 1987. Far more important for monetary policy are the Bundesbank's operations in the money markets, which allow it to fine-tune interest rates through repurchase agreements and other instruments. Despite the headline grabbing effect of the half point cut in the Lombard rate yesterday, what is more important for was the quarter-point cut in the discount rate, which acts as a floor to money market rates. All eyes are on Wednesday's repo auction, when rates are likely to be up to 0.25 per cent lower than the 8.57 per cent rate of earlier this week.</p>

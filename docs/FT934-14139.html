			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Kashmir militants raise the stakes: Mass protests threatened unless Indian army lifts shrine siege KASHMIRI political groups yesterday threatened to call mass demonstrations on Friday, the Moslem holy day, unless the siege of the holiest Moslem shrine in the troubled state of Kashmir is lifted. About 10,000 troops and police have surrounded the white marble Hazrat Bal shrine in Srinagar, the Kashmiri capital, since Friday when they trapped militants inside the building after a tip-off that they were planning to remove a relic (a strand of hair said to be the Prophet Mohammed's) and blame the government for its disappearance. The 50 separatist insurgents inside the shrine have threatened to blow it up if negotiations with the authorities fail. Around 100 pilgrims are also inside the shrine. The militants have demanded the removal of the army cordon, safe passage for themselves and the handing over of the holy relic to Moslem clergy. The government in New Delhi, campaigning for the crucial state elections in November, is particularly keen to resolve the deadlock peacefully. 'One false move and we will have a crisis on our hands,' said a senior official in the prime minister's office. The militants, who are unlikely to cause any real harm to the shrine because it would only alienate them from the public, are holding out in the hope that the government will attack them and destroy the building, inflaming religious passions. Embarrassed that the incident has brought the four-year-old Kashmiri crisis into the glare of the international community, the government is prepared to accept foreign mediation. India has been particularly defensive about allegations from foreign governments and human rights organisations that human rights are being violated by the army in Kashmir. The government has blamed Pakistan for funding and supporting the separatist movement in Kashmir, and has also accused Pakistan for being directly responsible for the occupation of the mosque. Srinagar was tense but mostly quiet yesterday with a military curfew enforced in the centre of the city and the rest affected by a protest strike called by the militants. Mr Abdul Ghani Lone, representative of the All Party Freedom Conference, an umbrella organisation of separatist political groups, blamed the government for starting the siege. He said that if the crisis was not resolved by 3pm today he and other political leaders would break the curfew and march towards the mosque. He called on all Kashmiris to start marches on Friday if the siege is not ended. However, residents said they doubted if demonstrations would be large, given the scale of the security forces present. Kashmiris mostly support the militants' goal of greater autonomy. General B C Joshi, chief of the Indian army, said yesterday that the operation against the militants in Hazrat Bal would continue until they surrendered. But he ruled out the use of force unless the army was provoked unduly by the militants. The strategy of the operation, Gen Joshi said, was to 'tire them out and break their will.'</p>

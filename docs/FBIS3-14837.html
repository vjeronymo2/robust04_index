			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by President Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk </F> with unidentified correspondents; place and date not given --  recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] Leonid Makarovych, as we have  learned -- from the foreign mass media, unfortunately -- you do  not intend to take part in the early presidential elections  being held in June of this year. From the press service's  explanation we may draw the conclusion that one of the reasons  is the the extremely compressed time period for holding  elections for all the power structures. The refusal expressed  in the interview is not your final word, however. Please tell me  under what circumstances you would be able to review your  decision.    [Kravchuk] I (?will draw your) attention to the fact that  our  mass media and the foreign mass media are currently paying,  well, solid attention, I would say, to this problem. Well, the  press here is international. So I do not think that it is of  special significance in which newspaper or at what microphone it  was said first. The main thing is that it was said.    I would not like this problem to be viewed solely in the  context of the president as an individual. I saw this when I  drew these conclusions (?in the) interview, the context of the  formation of power in Ukraine. For example, let us try to  predict the variants. The issue here is not so much the  compressed time period as the situation that might arise.    If, for example, on 27 March, the entire composition of the  new parliament is not elected. Well, I'll say, for example, 200  deputies are elected, or even 150. The current parliament does  not have 450 deputies at present, there are somewhat fewer than  that. Thus if new deputies are elected in 150 districts, then  there will be fewer than 300 in the current parliament; that is,  less than two thirds. It will immediately not be competent, no  matter what is said. I will refer to you to the Constitution,  article 104 -- the Supreme Council of Ukraine is competent to  adopt decisions if there are no fewer than two thirds of the  actual number of people's deputies of Ukraine present at the  sitting, whose authority is recognized and has not been  suspended by established legal procedure, but more than half of  its constitutional composition. It is clearly stated.    It cannot be that two people's deputies come to the Supreme  Council, one from the old convocation and one from the new  convocation. A collision arises immediately. Such a collision  arises because there is in fact no old Supreme Council, you see,  but there is no new one yet. The run-off elections take place,  say, after two weeks.    The law on run-off elections is a complex one, a very  complex one. How will it be, say, if another 100 deputies are  elected -- 150 [at the 27 March election] and 100 [at the  run-off election]; we will have 250 altogether, or maybe 280,  or 290. Again we do not have the necessary 300. We do not have  them here, and we do not have them there. Ukraine does not in  fact have a legislative body.    The elections move on to the next stage, that is elections  of  a president then, and elections of local chairmen of  authorities. What happens? There is no Supreme Council as such.  The new government is not formed. Its authorities have not  been determined. The president is the only legitimate figure,  who in fact can realistically manage the situation together with  the local administrations and bodies of power in the localities  -- all of them -- with councils, or rather the councils'  executive bodies and representatives, and the president's  administrations. There is no one else to do it.    If at this time the president also, the president who is in  power, runs for election, clearly the danger of a collapse of  executive power becomes probable. That is, in this case I am  not speaking about my possibilities or my wish [to run] or not.  I am driven into a corner -- either to leave everything and run  for election or to be responsible and not to take this step.    Thus my decision depends on many factors. The first one is  the election of the Supreme Council and the creation of a new  government -- this without fail. Then the new government -- the  Supreme Council having, say, adopted a law on the cabinet of  ministers, determines the government's powers, let us say,  transfers executive functions to it, and the government begins  to work. Executive power is in the hands of the government.  This is the first thing.    The second thing is that it is still necessary to determine  what kind of president is going to be elected and with what kind  of powers. If this happens in accordance with the present  Constitution, the president will again be elected as head of  state and head of the executive authority with the relevant  powers. You know how many questions there are with this. We  must determine this; that is, the president or a person who is a  candidate for the presidency, who runs for elections, knows what  his future powers will be and who he will be in the state. This  has not been determined at present. If he is elected in  accordance with the present Constitution, then the issue will  arise with the new Supreme Council of what sort of law there  should be on the cabinet of ministers, what the powers and  functions of the cabinet are, and the tugging of powers will  begin again -- from the president to the Supreme Council, from  the Supreme Council to, say, somewhere else, between the  president and cabinet of ministers. All of this vagueness is an  important point.    The third thing: If, having elected a new president in June  and chairmen of executive, rather chairmen of local bodies of  power, we have not determined the powers once and for all of  those chairmen, and have not determined when they could be  suspended, or in some other way if they violate, for example,  the Constitution or laws, who is to stop this? That law says  this will be determined by a separate law, but when will we have  this law? Before the election of those chairmen, so that they  know their final powers, or will it be after that, when they  have been elected and have begun to adopt laws? That is, we  have been working in such a tight schedule over this.    I do not want to blame anyone, but remember how the  preparation for elections proceeded -- under pressure of  strikes. A decision on a referendum was adopted. Then a  decision on elections was adopted. Time went by. Time was short  and an extremely complex political situation arose, or can  arise. So I said that in this situation my responsibility for  the state is greater than my wish to run in the coming elections  for president. This is the logic. There is no need to, say,  raise banners about this.    There is another aspect, and I must tell you about it. It  is not so much political as moral. I studied, like all of us,  in school and out of school, history and the fate of various  presidents, but I have not come across such dirt, such lack of  culture, such badgering as some people feel free to do, for  example, in parliament and outside parliament, and certain mass  media, as in Ukraine.    This could become a phenomenon of the history of the  Ukrainian state, when the first president, he might be liked, he  might suit someone, or he might not -- one can elect one or  elect a new one in a legitimate way, but to feel free to do such  things, establishing in the consciousness of generations such a,  I would say, boorish psychology, as some are striving to do and  are doing, this simply causes indignation, not just my own  personal indignation, but I see in some of my colleagues, too.    Clearly as a person, in this case, not as president, I  cannot  understand this, and I do not want to understand this. Here is  a factor that affects and will affect my decision. I cannot but  say this to my people. These are two aspects of it, which I  wanted to tell you about, so that you convey this to the  electors, who naturally are also interested in this decision by  the president and what has caused it.    [Correspondent] A question from HOLOS UKRAYINY. Leonid  Makarovych, as is well-known, elections under conditions of a  difficult economic crisis are always a risky matter. And Russia  is an example of this. In addition, many of your political  opponents connect our economic ills with Ukraine's course toward  independence, and now are especially demanding the restoration  of absolutely all links with Russia and CIS countries. And some  people are even proposing the Belarusian variant, which we know  about. What can you say about this?    [Kravchuk] Well, this is a subject of many aspects. Its  first aspect, from my point of view, is that in our  time--especially a year to one and a half years ago, thanks to  the vigorous, say, political activity of certain political  forces--we established in people's consciousness that the main  reason for the economic and social suffering was the severance  of economic links, and everything, say, boiled down to this  severence of economic links with CIS countries. I explained  then, if you remember, that if one is to restore all economic  links, which existed previously, then one would have to restore  the Soviet Union, to restore or to keep unchanged the whole  structure of industry in every CIS country.    Yesterday Russia's president said in his speech that Russia  should produce what Russians need and that which can be  competitive. The same goes for Ukraine and for other states,  and to speak of restoring all links is simply nonsense because a  new, new states and new economic structures are being  constructed. The point is to restore necessary links, to create  a market, for example, within a CIS framework -- whether a  common market or a market is not important, so as not to lose  this market and to trade on this market, to sell, to buy, to  resolve customs issues, other issues, tax issues, price issues.  All of this needs to be coordinated, generalized, and  elaborated. This is a normal process, but to speak again about  the previous links and to restore them all means restoring the  military-industrial complex; this means restoring everything  that we, Ukraine, produced as a part of a former great power.  This is the first thing.    And at all meetings now, you see, links are not mentioned.  Whoever wanted these links established them, for example  Zaporozhsich, it has splendid links with Russian enterprises,  and it works. There should be links between enterprises and not  between one state and another. This is a normal phenomenon.  States should create the right conditions between themselves,  but entrepreneurs and businessmen, plants, factories,  industrialists, agriculturists, commercial people, should  establish links between themselves, trade and produce. This is  the first thing.    The second thing: If a decision had suddenly been taken  here,  say, by Ukraine, like Belarus as you say, to enter the ruble  zone, I am convinced that Russia would not want this. It would  not have been able to carry our state, because what would it  mean for Russia to take Ukraine into the ruble zone? This would  mean giving Ukraine a considerable, even a very considerable  quantity of rubles--I cannot even name a figure--and this is its  wealth. This means it would be necessary for Ukraine to do [as  heard] or Russia would have demanded such concessions on the  part of Ukraine, which would have brought its economic  independence to nought, to nought.    If one is to ask the question today, one should ask it  directly, frankly, and sincerely, that Ukraine is changing its  course with regard to its continued economic and political  independence and is agreeing to such a decision -- the formation  of some other kind of, say, union, or whatever it might be  called. That is, I am in favor of a common market, in favor of  resolving all economic and political issues by way of  coordinated actions by CIS states. Here an economic union can  play an appropriate role, too.    Maybe, you see the Asian countries have created a single  economic space, but they have not created a unified currency.  (?I have in mind) CIS countries. We could have created a  single economic space, for example, Russia, Ukraine, and  Belarus, or the whole economic space, but this with one's own  currencies, one's own banks, one's own independent credit and  financial structures, that is, as an independent state. For  example, the three Baltic states created what is called the  Baltic Assembly, but no one is losing or taking steps to lose  their independence.    Any kind of economic integration is a realistic process, but  it should clearly determine whether states are integrating or  whether some kind of autonomous or oblast structures are  integrating. This should be clearly explained to people. Those  who hint at something, that we should change our course, we  should do this and do that, they are simply either afraid to say  sincerely what they finally want -- and we have such sirs, who  were in power in their time, who are now hinting at various,  say, variants, and want to win for themselves a post of national  hero and savior of Ukraine. There are such people.  Incidentally, they could have done this when in power, but one  should then say directly, this is my surname, these are my first  names and patronymic, and I am telling you that one should put  an end to all of these problems of independence, unite in a  single state, and may that state then live on. Why deceive  people and say that some want this, and some want that, but I  want something, but do not know myself what, or maybe I know,  but I am afraid to say what.    [Correspondent] A question from URYADOVYY KURYER, please.  Leonid Makarovych, should one not view the program of actions  and first steps of the new president of Crimea as the beginning  of Ukraine's federalization? What is your attitude to the idea  of Ukraine's federalization in general?    [Kravchuk] I think that when such a complex issue is to be  resolved, one should always turn to history. See how federative  states were formed. Well, take Germany and the United States  for example. They were formed historically by way of annexation  at a certain time, lands there, states there, to a state  structure, which was already formed. For example, the state of  Texas was annexed considerably later than, say, other states;  that is, this was a process of annexing territories to a state  structure, which were annexed on appropriate terms. And  federations formed in this way.    We have a unitary state. Well, the Crimea, its special  status, is simply, say, connected with its history surely. I  will return to the Crimea later. So why now, when we have a  unitary state, does one consciously suddenly begin to divide it  into federative centers from above, well what for, when there is  an undivided unitary state, not large in territory, if one is to  compare it, for example, with other states, and is compact,  having history in common. I am in favor of regions having the  most extensive economic self-determination, the most extensive,  in issues of, for example, the budget, finances, customs, I mean  customs problems on the borders, and so on, influence on  enterprises, powers connected with managing state property, of  which there is a great proportion there now, that is the most  extensive [economic self-determination], including Crimea. This  is my point of view. It seems to me that this is the most  realistic point of view at present, which will not cause another  division and redivision of our political problems. Well,  Russia's experience shows that Russia as a federation, and it  was not formed yesterday, has problems, too. So we will begin  suddenly, and we will begin with problems.    Regarding Crimea: Well, people often accuse the president  and the Supreme Council chairman that we are supposedly the  chief culprits for there being an Autonomous Republic of Crimea.  I would like to refer you to 1990 again, to history, when the  Soviet Union still existed, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the  USSR Congress of People's Deputies, and the Communist Party of  the Soviet Union existed then, too. And then the Crimeans, and  the Crimean party -- the Communist Party -- and the oblast  council put the question of a referendum regarding autonomy.  And the second point -- the issue of what kind of status was  discussed, where was Crimea to belong -- it was already  beginning to be discussed then. Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev  often hinted to me -- you watch what is going on in Crimea. I  knew for certain then that if I did not support what was  happening there, if I banned it, then this would not mean that  everyone there would suddenly listen to me.    Then Crimea would turn directly to the USSR, not to Russia,  and the Supreme Soviet, having the powers, would adopt this  resolution, because there was a unified Soviet Union, and all of  this talk that Ukraine was a state in the Soviet Union, well we  know what sort of a state it was, and Crimea would transfer from  Ukraine. Now, when we have done this, it is not so simple now.  The Union institutions, which could have adopted this, do not  exist now, and Russia signed a treaty with Ukraine on us not  having territorial claims on each other, back in 1990.    In this way this question sounds entirely different now,  and now, and in the agreement, which we signed in Moscow with  Bill Clinton and Yeltsin with regard to nuclear questions, there  is a stance there that territorial integrity and inviolability  will be respected both by the United States and by Russia, and  so on. Already we, when--I say this frankly, I have never said  this to my people, but there is speculation going on around this  and people are speculating who know this well. Perhaps they are  making use of this in an election campaign. God knows. Or  perhaps they are simply showing ignorance, although I do not  think that academicians can show ignorance in this matter.  Although it happens. Therefore, I am saying sincerely that  this was a considered step.    Now there have been elections for a Crimean president.  People  became so absurd as to ask whether I really have the right to  meet the president of Crimea. Well, firstly, this is not a  right that I am going to ask anyone for. This is the first  thing. I could not have met him under one circumstance -- if  Ukraine's Supreme Council had revoked the law on elections of  the Crimean president and they had taken place, then the Crimean  president would have been outside the law and I would never in  my life have met him.    But as this did not happen, that is, elections are  elections,  I meet him, and it is my opinion that it is better to meet than  not to meet and it is better to resolve issues than not to  resolve them and drive them into a dead end. It is better to go  along the path of, say, mutual understanding, and not the path  of confrontation. I am convinced that the new president of  Crimea, the new government, and everyone will go along this  path, because the other path leads to trouble. They would be  the initiators of this trouble; they would assume the highest  responsibility, because Ukraine, if we are looking at this, is  fussing and bothering over Crimea so much that there is nowhere  to go from here.    And we will talk about of how many violations there are of  the (?letter of) the law, and the referendum law was violated,  for example, which does not comply in the constitution to  Ukraine's referendum law, the Crimean one I mean, the referendum  law in Crimea. And the Supreme Council, the Presidium, and all  of us, sent documents, said that they should be brought into  line with Ukraine's Constitution. They keep biding their time.    Yesterday, the Supreme Council adopted an appropriate  document and gave explanations. I think that this should  influence--influence reason, common sense--that Crimea is at the  moment an autonomous constituent part of Ukraine and any actions  directed against this most important political, say, pivotal  issue, will necessarily be viewed as illegal, as illegal. This  should be kept in mind. I think that we will manage to settle  these issues, we will manage to settle them, and again we will  resolve them by way of talks, by way of debates, by way of  coordination both of legislative and executive power documents  and structures.    [Correspondent] Leonid Makarovych, Ukrainian Radio, news  service. I would like to return to our difficult economic and  domestic situation and the related foreign economic policy of  our state. In your opinion, why is privatization not occurring  in our country? And what is it necessary to do to activate  foreign investments?    [Kravchuk] Well, privatization has not occurred for many  reasons. First, we worked on privatization legislation for a  very long time. This is the first thing. The second thing is,  legislation is all very well, but various political forces, and  in the power structures too, in their time had varying attitudes  to privatization. The previous governments, Kuchma's government  and Fokin's government, did practically nothing for  privatization, practically nothing. Everything was frozen.    Only now are the first steps beginning to be taken.  Appropriate programs are being adopted. Appropriate actions  have begun in the regions, but again this will depend on how  people there, from the village council to the Cabinet of  Ministers, will act and resolve these issues. That is, we were  late with privatization.    Although, I should tell you that privatization in Ukraine,  taking account of its heavy industrial structure--for example,  33 percent is concentrated in the military-industrial complex of  the former Soviet Union. Well, you see, these are giants, and  is it really so simple to privatize the Malyshev Plant or the  Southern Machine-Building Plant. We smelted half the metal in  Ukraine. Is it really so simple to privatize metallurgical  plants, mines, and so on? One has to see all of this. This is  a fearful structure -- nuclear power engineering and so on, but  we are late and now these steps have begun.    Second, taking account of our leaps I would call them, in  such an acute issue as nuclear weapons, where we announced one  course to begin with, said we would manage to become nonnuclear  quickly, then started to refine it. There were such layers that  it then became entirely incomprehensible to some what we really  wanted. This led to economic assistance to us being frozen on  the part of Western countries. I will give you only one  example. You probably know it, but I will give it. For  example, assistance to the Baltic countries -- all of Western  assistance in relation to gross national product comes to 25  percent. For Ukraine it is 0.5 percent, and only now, when we  have determined our position with regard to this acute issue for  the world, for humanity, has some kind of gradual progress begun  somewhere. This does not yet mean that it is finished, but it  has begun. For example, normal economic relations have begun to  be established, and there is an entirely different attitude to  us.    Therefore, there are many reasons here and what occurred  was our fault. I am being frank. There are objective problems  here, but the fault for the inconsistency and indecisiveness,  both in privatization and in the entire sphere of politics, was  severely marked in this sphere of life. [1 minute break in  transmission] ...to work and earn money. I do not see that there  is any other way. The situation regarding pensioners, doctors,  and teachers is different. They are subject to the budget and  there is a different attitude toward them. Let us say, Ukraine  has up to 40 million hectares of land: We spend a lot of time  deciding whether or not to give them land; we then make a  decision to allow them to, let us say, build together with the  land and make a decision not to let them build with the land.    As you see there are people with such a mentality who live  constantly in fear that we will sell the land to somebody. If  somebody wants to build a factory in Ukraine, and if we say that  the land on which the factory is built belongs to the factory,  then what is wrong with this? We must not think like this. We  are always arguing about this. I repeat, we have 39 million  hectares of land in Ukraine. This is practically 1 million  hectares per person, or even more if we are only talking about  adults. Where is the problem here?    Ivan Stepanovych Plyushch, during the Supreme Council  sessions, mentioned figures of many countries, including Turkey  and other countries, where the population is the same and where  they utilize only half of their land and, as well as being  self-sufficient, they also export their products. But we cannot  even do this. Land must be utilized. I would advise that in  life we must work and earn a living and produce. At present,  the majority of the population has begun to earn in a different  way, instead of producing and earning a living. This is our  misfortune and I must not severely condemn this. If one-third  of the population is traveling to the market on trains, then  this is a particular phenomenon, although if you remember there  was a similar situation six or seven years ago in Poland and  Poles were everywhere in China, Jamaica, etc. They were buying,  selling everything and transporting it, but now they have begun  some other activities because there is an accumulation of funds  and they have begun to work. One has to experience this. There  must be a desire by everyone to find a way out. It is no use  saying that the president has not found a way out. Let them  elect a holy president tomorrow, if one could be found. He will  not be able to solve anything on his own, unless, at first,  there is a desire on the part of everyone to work and secondly,  unless there is accord in society. We should know that we must  manage this land, this Ukraine, because nobody will do it for us.    Some are calling for (?dependency), and others are calling  for a return to the old structures, and now there is an  electoral campaign and it is arousing the people. You must  understand that this does not give the people vigor, strength,  nor optimism. There should be an objective. I understand that  the people have become disillusioned. They even say: Why should  I go and vote and who should I vote for? These are the kind of  letters I am receiving. But I would like to say something with  regard to my answer to your first question. Without fail, we  must have elections, it is worse not to. There must be an  authority. When there is authority there is also hope and let  us say, levers that will not permit surprises. There will be  somebody who will make the decisions.    For example, let us say that the Supreme Council cannot be  convened. The president has authority with regard to executive  power in Crimea. Elections have taken place. Certain processes  of a legislative nature have taken place in Crimea. Who should  repeal what has taken place in Crimea? How should the Supreme  Council act? I would like the people to understand that it is  all very difficult, very difficult. They ask: Who should I  listen to? You are all promising something, why should I go and  vote? But elections must be held in order to preserve the state  and make an important step in forming the political and power  structures.    Some say that the new Supreme Council will be worse than the  present one. I will not say whether it will be worse or better.  It will be a new parliament. Those deputies who do not want  elections keep on saying that it will be worse. We will see  what kind of parliament it will be, but the main thing is that  the Supreme Council should be elected, and that it should begin  to take steps toward a structural reorganization and political  reconstruction, that it begins to take specific steps toward  reforms, market and social protection. It should not go from  one extreme to the other depending on polarization or political  inclinations. It should be a Supreme Council with a clear  policy that will form a government. The government will present  a program and a process of normal work should begin. We have to  go along this path. I turn to the people with a call to  overcome these personal problems at the time of the elections.  I know that when people go to cast their votes and, let us say  a bus does not turn up, they come back and angrily say that if  they do not want us to vote, we will not vote.    We must understand that we are talking about authority. The  state must have authority. If it is no good, then we must  reelect it. If there is anarchy then that will be the end and  there will be trouble. There could be a collision or  confrontation or something else. We must not allow this. I  simply wanted to explain the situation because as I can see, it  is taking on such a tone and there are various interpretations  that do not precisely define my position or my views. Sometimes  people say to me that I am interested in the elections not  taking place. I have the most interest that elections take  place. Perhaps those who want to preserve their positions for  some considerable time are interested. Regarding myself, I have  defined my position and have told you this frankly, and I tell  the people and everybody else that I have no personal interests.  My interest is that of Ukraine.</p>

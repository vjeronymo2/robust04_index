			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y sets deadline for approval on debt plan OLYMPIA &amp; York, the Canadian property developer which has been under court protection since mid-May, is aiming to obtain creditors' approval by the end of November for a plan to restructure about two-thirds of its CDollars 13.5bn (USDollars 11.3bn) debt. O&amp;Y has indicated to creditors of its Canadian operations that it intends to ask an Ontario judge to extend its protection from October 21 to the end of the year, in order to finalise the restructuring. Its plans are complicated, however, by the fact that negotiations with 27 different creditor groups are not proceeding at the same pace. An official of one project lender said yesterday that O&amp;Y has made 'great progress' in talks on some of its 11 core Canadian properties, but that wide differences still remain on others. A lawyer for another group of lenders predicted that it is 'most unlikely' that agreements can be signed by the end of November. 'Most of their proposals are so far out that it would take a significant change in position and significant redrafting to get there,' he said. O&amp;Y last month presented draft restructuring proposals. The proposals effectively ask project lenders to extend the maturity dates of their loans and furthermore to accept tax-exempt 'distress' preferred shares. Unsecured lenders would exchange their debt for bonds convertible into equity in the parent company, Olympia &amp; York Developments. O&amp;Y has not offered to hand over any of its Canadian properties to their bondholders as it has done with the mammoth building at 55 Water Street in New York. Mr Steve Miller, O&amp;Y's chief negotiator, is understood to have told the lenders that none of the Canadian properties falls into the same 'basket-case' category as the Water Street property. That property has a high vacancy rate and it is also in need of expensive renovations.</p>

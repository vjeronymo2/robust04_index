			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / UK Company News: All-round growth lifts Misys 66% MISYS, the computer services group, yesterday reported a 66 per cent increase in annual profits, reflecting strong organic growth and a good performance by acquired businesses. Pre-tax profits in the year to May 31 advanced from Pounds 9.1m to Pounds 15.1m, struck after a Pounds 1.19m provision for proposed reorganisation and other costs, principally within the open systems and computer services divisions. Earnings per share improved by 54 per cent to 27.4p (17.8p); a proposed final dividend of 4.4p brings the total for the year to 7.01p (6.1p). Turnover expanded by 30 per cent to Pounds 88.8m (Pounds 68m) including Pounds 14.8m from acquisitions. Hardware revenues, as expected, continued to fall but software sales increased by 41 per cent. The acquisition of the Countrywide companies in June last year added to the underlying growth in service revenues, which jumped 38 per cent. Software products and support services now account for 74 per cent of group revenues, up from 70 per cent a year ago. Mr Kevin Lomax, chairman, noted that this improvement in the mix of revenues has resulted in a useful rise in gross margins. A particularly strong performance by the financial services division helped boost group operating profits to Pounds 14.7m (Pounds 8.87m) including Pounds 4.09m from acquisitions. The improvement in operating profits of businesses owned throughout the whole of the past two years, excluding the reorganisation provision, accounted for just over half the total increase for the group over the previous year. The organic growth in profits mainly reflected growth in market share for software products and services which, Mr Lomax said, had continued to improve their competitive positions. Order books in these businesses and in the group as a whole ended the year at record levels. The group continued to maintain firm control over working capital and ended the year with cash balances of Pounds 21m (Pounds 10m). This was after spending about Pounds 2.9m on acquisitions which, aside from Countrywide, included Specialist, Innsite and CMS. COMMENT With Pounds 21m of cash in the bank Misys has considerable financial flexibility and remains on the lookout for possible UK and international acquisitions. However, recent results have been underpinned by solid organic growth, although the financial services division in particular has been strengthened considerably by the Countrywide companies, which outperformed expectations. Despite lower hardware sales the steady growth of higher margin software and service revenues bodes well for the future, as does the continued heavy emphasis on the development and enhancement of its product range. Last year R&amp;D spending grew by more than 30 per cent. Yesterday the share price gained another 11p to 518p, and analysts were upgrading their forecasts. With projected pre-tax profits of Pounds 18.6m and earnings of 32.3p this year, the shares are trading on a prospective p/e of 16 and still rate as a buy.</p>

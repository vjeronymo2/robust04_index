He added that following the  Mexican crisis "any responsible government will seek to prevent  a repetition in their countries."    Ruckauf said that democratic governments "are forced to  maintain the monopoly of force," adding that this acts "as a  mechanism of self-preservation."    He reaffirmed the Executive Branch's "conviction" that "a  specific group caused the incidents," in Santiago del Estero.  He added, however, that "there are no documents to prove that  it involved a given sector or a precise trend."    Thus, Ruckauf specified that there are no documents to prove  the presence of Shining Path guerrillas, although he admitted  that "blank forms were found during some police raids" and that  some Bolivian and Peruvian citizens "have problems with their  documents."    He said: "This does not necessarily indicate that they are  linked to guerrilla groups, merely to other types of crimes or  even a simple covert migratory operation."    In an interview with a Buenos Aires daily, Ruckauf said the  electricity service company Edesur [Southern Greater Buenos  Aires Electricity Company] suffered some attacks on its  installations. He said: "it would be premature to say that an  armed organization are behind these terrorist acts."    In conclusion, the minister said the government has decided  "it is better safe than sorry," which is why President Carlos  Menem "ordered an analysis of the Latin American and Argentine  situation."</p>

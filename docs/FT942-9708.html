			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Israel to consider Mideast common market Israel would consider the establishment of a common market in the Middle East in the next decade following infrastructure developments in the region, Mr Yossi Beilin, Israel's deputy foreign minister, said yesterday. Mr Beilin, speaking to a group of UK financiers with interests in the recently launched Israel Fund Plc, emphasised the benefits of co-ordinated policies for energy, transport, telecommunications and water, but stressed that regional co-operation in these areas was a prerequisite for further integration. 'In the next five years in the Middle East, with Palestine, Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, we may see the building of a common infrastructure. If we do, in the next 10 years or so we can look at the possibility of a common market.' Mr Beilin said. Linking electricity grids is one initiative, crucial for further interdependence, which is under way. Mr Beilin argued that connecting grids with Egypt and Jordan, and thereby joining existing agreements with Turkey and Iraq, would save Israel Dollars 700m per year because of the high costs of the country's gas-fired electricity. He also claims, however, that a regional agreement on electricity could save all participants as much as Dollars 4bn each year. Other developments advocated by Mr Beilin include an open skies policy ending 'idiotic restrictions' on air travel which had forced Israel to 'live for so many years like an island'. Such a liberalisation in the movement of goods and people would, of course, have to be matched on the ground. The minister pointed out that economic integration in the area would be of benefit to all but easy for none. Vast differences in the numbers of skilled workers in the labour markets, the levels of capital investment and national product between countries would have to be addressed before any common market could be established.</p>

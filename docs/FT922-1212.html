			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Meeting over transfer of care SENIOR MINISTERS met at Downing Street yesterday to try to resolve the difficulties over the planned transfer of responsibility for community care from the government to local authorities. At a discussion chaired by Mr John Major and including ministers from the health, social security and environment departments agreed to press ahead with the aim of making the transfer as intended in April next year. Problems over the funding of the arrangement had led to suggestions from some ministers that the transfer should be delayed again, or even postponed to allow an alternative policy to be developed. The decision to carry on despite the doubts that had been raised will put increased pressure on Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, whose department is in the lead in the coming autumn public spending round to ensure that enough money accompanies the transfer to make the policy a success.</p>

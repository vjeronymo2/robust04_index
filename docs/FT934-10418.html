			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Cadbury code has not been undermined Sir, There has been much coverage of the losses at Queens Moat Houses. There are two areas that investors and lenders must consider. First, the apparent lack of basic financial controls. This adds fuel to the Cadbury debate. Sceptics have said that compliance with many of Cadbury's structural recommendations did nothing to prevent the problems, which only proves that Cadbury achieves little. I take a different view. I support the thrust of the Cadbury Code, but structures alone are not enough. Directors must also understand their responsibilities, and above all act on them. The public statement that Cadbury requires on internal controls will concentrate directors' minds on this task and this must be a good thing. But understanding needs robust, straightforward guidance - not academic tracts. The challenge for the business community is to produce this. At present this has not been achieved and we must now all work together to construct guidance that is truly practical. The second issue is the divergent hotel valuations. Blaming the surveyors is all too easy. A hotel valuation involves valuing a business. What financial information and forecasts were the surveyors given? How reliable was this information? Did the auditors or the surveyors verify it? Even where the financial information is the same, different judgments may be made. The skills required to value a business are much broader than those normally expected of a surveyor in valuing an investment property. Is it a really a job for surveyors alone? I believe that the surveyors and the accounting profession must work together to establish a framework that can command the confidence of the business community.

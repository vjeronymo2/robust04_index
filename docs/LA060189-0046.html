			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BUTCHER: PORK LEG CAN BE TURNED INTO VARIETY OF MEALS  </P> <P> If you like your pork lean and inexpensive, look to the leg. Fresh leg of pork  is often one of the best pork buys in any meat case.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, many people -- even those who love good, lean, low-cost pork --  pass up a good buy on a fresh leg because it's too big.  </P> <P> People can't imagine what to do with one, except roast it and eat it for weeks.  But there are ways to work with a fresh leg of pork to provide many different  and varied meals -- pork steaks, cutlets, roasts and kebabs for the barbecue.  </P> <P> A whole leg of fresh pork will weigh between 16 and 20 pounds and that is,  admittedly, a good-size hunk of meat, but you usually can get the shank half of  the leg at the same low price when fresh legs of pork are "on special."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shank Is Easier  </P> <P> The shank half is by far the best half for a novice to work with. It does not  contain the hip bone and that makes it much less difficult than the butt half  to divide into many meals.  </P> <P> A shank half leg of fresh pork can be turned into a freezer full of great  meal-making meat even for the smallest family.  </P> <P> There are four separate muscles that make up a leg of pork (a leg of any meat  for that matter): the top, the tip, the eye and the bottom muscles. Taking one  apart is not a difficult project and the marvelous meals that may be made from  the component parts make the project more than worth the effort.  </P> <P> First, remove the hock, if there is one. Some legs come with the hock already  removed. Find the joint with the point of your knife, then cut through it to  separate the hock from the rest of the leg. Use the hock to make a good  stick-to-the-ribs pork-and-beans casserole.  </P> <P> Next, remove the skin. Most fresh legs of pork are sold with the skin still on.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Use the Skin  </P> <P> There are several things that you can do with the skin; it should not be  wasted. For one, cut it into squares and add it to the hock when you cook  beans.  </P> <P> For another, tie it around a piece of lean, boneless pork that you roast over  the coals and let it baste the meat as it turns crackin' good and crisp. And if  you are into making your own sausage, try using fresh pork skin as an  ingredient. It gives sausage a nice texture.  </P> <P> Next, separate each of the muscles of the leg by cutting along the natural  seams that divide them. There is really no trick to it, the muscles are clearly  defined and easy to separate. What you do with the individual muscles once you  have them separated is limited by little but your imagination.  </P> <P> The top and tip muscle are the most tender (although none is apt to be tough).  Use them for roasting or frying or cut them into thin strips or cubes for  stir-fry dishes or thin slices for cutlets. The bottom and eye muscles are  perfect for braised dishes.  </P> <P> Here are a few quick-to-fix and delicious dishes perfect for the meat of the  leg.  </P> <P> TUSCAN PORK WITH  </P> <P> PEPPERS  </P> <P> 1/4 cup olive oil  </P> <P> 2 pounds boneless pork leg, cut into 1-inch cubes  </P> <P> 4 cloves garlic, minced  </P> <P> 1 (29-ounce) can whole tomatoes, undrained  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon dried basil  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon dried oregano  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> 1/2 cup dry white wine  </P> <P> 1 large onion, sliced  </P> <P> 1 sweet red pepper, seeded and sliced  </P> <P> 1 green pepper, seeded and sliced  </P> <P> Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large heavy skillet or Dutch oven over medium high  heat.

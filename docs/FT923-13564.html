			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Albania pays dearly for a new economy THE sight of elderly women in white headscarves using sickles to harvest Albania's wheat crop says much about the country's continuing problems of food production. After three years of drought and another of political and economic upheaval, the transition from Stalinist self-sufficiency to a market economy is being slowed by acute shortages of basic commodities, from flour and sugar to soap and writing paper. Last week's attempted exodus to Italy by thousands of Albanians followed the announcement of harsh economic reforms in accordance with an IMF adjustment programme due to take effect next month. These include abolition of wage subsidies and price controls on most goods, though a price ceiling will be imposed for bread, cooking oil and sugar. Dr Abdyl Sinani, a senior official in the industry and food ministry, says: 'The government view is that it will be another three years before we get back to our standard of living in 1989' - the last year before communism started to crumble. This year, wheat production will amount to only 250,000 tonnes, half last year's output and 700,000 tonnes short of the amount needed to provide Albania's 3.3m population with a daily loaf of bread. Milk and meat are hard to find because livestock breeders avoid selling young animals for slaughter to build up herds from a few animals acquired when the co-operatives' livestock was shared out last year. Italian soldiers and a Greek state relief organisation make daily truck deliveries of flour and other essentials, provided under an Ecu45m (Pounds 31.8m) European Community emergency aid scheme. This week, the EC is expected to approve another Ecu35m as an immediate balance of payments grant for Albania to buy industrial spare parts and raw materials. This amount is to be matched by the Group of 24 industrial states under a co-ordinated aid plan for former communist countries.</p>

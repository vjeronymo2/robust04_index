"It is time for the regional and international communities  to  come to the assistance of the people of St. Kitts and Nevis in  finding a solution to our problems before the situation  escalates further," the party said in a statement.    The party is pressing for fresh general elections, arguing  that the minority coalition government formed by Prime Minister  Kennedy Simmonds' People's Action Movement [PAM] and the Nevis  Reformation Party has no moral authority to run the twin-island  state.    The coalition holds five of the eleven seats in parliament.  The Labour Party has four (like PAM) and the Concerned  Citizen's Movement two.    On Wednesday, Labour Party supporters took their campaign  for  fresh elections to parliament, meeting for the first time since  the November 29 election.    Outside parliament, they clashed with police, who fired stun  grenades to keep back the crowd and clear the way after the  presentation of the traditional throne speech for the exit of  Governor-general Sir Clement Arrindell, Prime Minister Simmonds  and other officials.    At least two persons were reported to have been injured.    The Labour Party said parliament "was opened amid loud  noises  from unarmed people calling for fresh elections, shattering  glass and bottles, smoke bombs, tear gas explosions and  concussion bombs fired on the protesters by the police".    The party said businesses and banks had been closed, school  children sent home and government departments closed to the  public.    It accused the government of "repressive and military action  ... just to open parliament".    The party said it was clear "that the people of St. Kitts do  not intend to accept the Simmonds regime, and they would  continue to struggle for the government of their choice and for  fairness and justice until Dr Simmonds honours the agreement he  made with the national church leaders for fresh elections within  six months".    Simmonds described the protest action as "unfortunate and  really distressing".    The police reported the incident had been brought under  control by midday.</p>

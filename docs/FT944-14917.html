			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Survey of the UK Gas Market (6): Uncertainty causes delays / A look at the concerns of independent gas companies Quadrant, Alliance and Kinetica, just a few of the more than 40 companies which make up the UK's independent gas sector, may not be household names. But in many cases their shareholders are. A large number of the biggest oil and gas companies in the world have been drawn to the UK gas market, the fifth largest in the world and one of the fastest growing. For most oil and gas producers, the appeal is simple: the opening of the domestic gas market is an opportunity to extract a higher value from North Sea gas reserves than was possible in the past by selling to British Gas, for years the only buyer. Some also see the gas market as a logical downstream expansion. Natural gas is a product which can be marketed alongside other energy sources such as petrol, electricity or home heating oil. The government's liberalisation programme has also encouraged relative minnows to swim alongside the oil majors. John Astrop, commercial director of Kinetica, a joint venture between PowerGen of the UK and US oil company Conoco, says it is still possible for 'someone sitting in a room with a telephone and a fax to run a gas supply business'. Both minnows and majors, however, have been worried that the government will fail to put forward legislation to open the domestic market. The independents have mounted an intense lobbying campaign in recent months to reassure politicians that retail gas prices are likely to fall once competition takes hold. The political uncertainty has caused many independents to delay making the investments needed to operate in a competitive domestic market. Companies say it is also having an effect on decisions about whether to develop some North Sea gas fields and worry that prolonged delays could undermine the continuing support from their parent companies needed to stay in the market. The political uncertainty also coincides with growing competition and falling margins in those segments of the market open to competition. In recent years Ofgas, the industry regulator, has encouraged competition by setting market share targets in the mainly commercial and industrial segments above 2,500 therms a year. It also required British Gas to make available large quantities of gas to the independents as another means of encouraging competition. The low overheads of the independents enabled them to undercut British Gas prices by 10-15 per cent, and they have quickly captured the mandated 55 per cent of the firm contract market above 2,500 therms a year. But the healthy margins the independents enjoyed in the early stages of competition have disappeared as the focus of competition has shifted away from taking market share from British Gas to intense competition between the independents. The intensity of the competition is reflected in the fact that the independents submit 15,000 nominations a week to TransCo, the monopoly gas transporter, for quotes on the cost of transporting gas to potential customers. But only 1,500 result in firm contracts, according to TransCo. Most independents believe the tough operating environment will trigger a wave of rationalisation in the sector over the next two to three years. 'The people who look most vulnerable are those without heavyweight financial backing,' says one industry executive. Others say some of the 'true independents' - those not connected with North Sea producers and which do not have ready access to cheap supplies of gas - may be forced to retreat to niche markets or confine their activities to gas trading. The tough financial conditions likely to be required by the government to qualify for a public gas supply licence may also cause some companies to drop out, say industry analysts. But the sheer size of the domestic market encourages a number of companies. Just a 5 per cent market share would still translate into nearly 1m customers, spending on average more than Pounds 250 a year. Details of the market strategies likely to be used by the independents will not be known until the conditions of the public gas supply licences are agreed. But several basic approaches are becoming apparent. One is the total energy package, with companies likely to offer electricity as well as gas. Some packages may also contain energy savings schemes to induce consumers to switch suppliers, although prices are likely to be the focus in the initial stages of competition. Some companies intend to link their gas business to existing downstream activities. Total, for example, says its customers will be able to pay their gas bills at their petrol stations. There is also the possibility that gas consumers will be included in the promotional schemes now run by oil companies at their service stations. Ofgas officials say they would be pleased to see non-energy companies enter the business. These could include credit card companies with existing large billing systems able to handle hundreds of thousands of accounts. But industry executives say it is more likely that oil and gas companies would form joint ventures with big retailers, such as supermarket or department store chains. 'The marketplace could become a battleground for brand names,' says one. If it does, most independents concede that the strongest brand name is likely to remain British Gas. They worry that consumer inertia could prove the biggest barrier to their expansion into the market, and cite British Telecom as an example of how consumers stick to their existing supplier even though a cheaper alternative is available.</p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABANDONED CHILDREN  </P> <P> Regarding the April 14 article on the abandoned children, "Cast-Off Babies on  the Rise in the County," why is the Department Children's Services spending any  of its valuable time looking for people who don't want their children and who  have made that quite clear? Go look for some good adoptive parents, and  quickly.  </P> <P> Running cute little mug shots of these waifs and pleading for their mothers to  reconsider reminds me more of a Hollywood movie of the 1930s than the reality  of Los Angeles in the '90s.  </P> <P> We're not talking about poor but impeccably dressed Constance Bennett leaving  her beloved child with nuns at the convent. We're talking about abuse, drugs,  poverty, foster homes and, possibly, death at an early age. We're talking about  leaving kids in dumpsters.  </P> <P> It's going to get worse. It's time to sever parental rights and save these  kids.  </P> <P> KATHLEEN R. PERRIER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

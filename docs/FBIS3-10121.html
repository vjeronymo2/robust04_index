			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio </F> by Evelyn Blanck: "I Would Say the Lion Roared Again;" place and  date not given]    [Text] On 18 February, in a climate of tension generated by  persistent rumors concerning his resignation or a possible  attack on him, the president disclosed important changes within  his security cabinet. Among those dismissed was General Jose  Luis Quilo Ayuso, chief of the General Staff of National  Defense, a key position within the Armed Forces.    [Blanck] You have said that recent changes within the  security cabinet will strengthen the country's institutionality  and foster unity within the Armed Forces. Why?    [De Leon] I know where you are coming from. The rumors that  have circulated over the past few days concerning a coup d'etat  are just that; rumors. No attempt has ever been made to disrupt  constitutional order as in May 1988; there have only been  reports concerning movements against the government. All of  this has taken place outside the Army and although an attempt  was made to approach the military, it did not succeed.    [Blanck] Over the past few days more has been said  concerning  the involvement of several civilians in a conspiracy against you  rather than of a coup attempt. A vice presidential adviser, a  Parlacen [Central American Parliament] deputy and a former  president have been mentioned. Will you prosecute them?    [De Leon] If we had names and dates we would have taken them  to court already because we would be dealing with actions  classified as crimes under the Penal Code. However, we are  dealing with rumors that may be well founded. It is said that  certain individuals who have a coupist calling have participated  in these activities and there is evidence that they have spoken  with one another. What we do not have is evidence against them.  In fact, the resignation of one of the persons you mentioned,  Fernando Andrade Diaz-Duran, was accepted on that same Friday.  The message we are sending is very clear.    [Blanck] Doesn't the dismissal of Gen. Jose Luis Quilo Ayuso  close the chapter initiated with the departure of General Jose  Domingo Garcia Samayoa in mid-1993?    [De Leon] Top Army commanders were dismissed after 25 May  because they led the Armed Forces during a regime that ended  with the disruption of constitutional order. In the case of  Gen. Quilo Ayuso, he was removed because a new policy had to be  coordinated. It was a decision of state for purposes of state.    [Blanck] However, this coordination comes eight months after  you took office. Isn't that a long time?    [De Leon] The first mandate I received from the Guatemalan  people was to consolidate the country institutionally. The  changes that were made during the first phase of this mandate  are the result of this. Furthermore, during the course of these  months there was also a battle to purge state institutions,  which concluded with the referendum. Having done this I thought  it necessary to move one man to achieve consolidation. Yes,  eight months have passed, but the president in his capacity as  commander of the Army, used them to become acquainted with the  situation.    [Blanck] What do you expect from Gen. Marco Antonio  Gonzalez Taracena, the new chief of staff for Defense?    [De Leon] Excellent coordination with the defense minister.  I expect Gen. Taracena to transmit the High Command's way of  thinking to the officers with his leadership. Also, I have told  him and the minister that from now on I will work more closely  with the High Command and involve myself with reality. This  does not mean that I will encroach on them, but rather that I  will engage more in problems dealing with the Armed Forces. I  met with them on Saturday and asked them for a list of the  Army's problems.    [Blanck] Did Gen. Quilo Ayuso maintain the coordination you  speak about with the defense minister?    [De Leon] There have been rumors of a disagreement between  the defense minister and Gen. Ayuso, but this disagreement  really did not exist. Nevertheless, an apparent division is not  good for the Army. An institution must have leaders who are  sure of themselves. There just cannot be any doubts that all of  the leaders are following the same course of action.    [Blanck] A MIAMI HERALD article says you are restricted by a  powerful Army. Is this true?    [De Leon] Quite the contrary. The changes announced on  Friday prove the Army's support for the president. Certainly,  military power is this government's fundamental pillar. This  does not mean the president's militarization, however, but  absolute support for him and this transition government. I  would say that the lion roared again on Friday.    [Blanck] On Tuesday, 8 February, you reportedly told a group  of friends you would never resign your position as president.  Is it true?    [De Leon] It has never crossed my mind. Much less now, after  the referendum, not because it represents a victory -- I do not  want to blind myself on this -- but because this page is a  closed chapter in history.    [Blanck] The climate of confrontation between Congress and  the Executive Branch persists, however. What will happen if the  deputies fail to make good their pledges with the Executive  Branch?    [De Leon] The approved reforms are irreversible. In view of  this reality, the political parties are aware of the risk  involved if they fail to behave properly. This means they must  carry out the Electoral and Political Parties Law and debate the  three basic points: participation of civic committees, reduction  of the number of deputies, and the supervision of the use of  funds. We are not sure whether or not we will be able to do the  latter.    [Blanck] Has a channel of communication been opened between  the two state branches after the rapprochement between you and  Congress President Vinicio Villar in Salama?    [De Leon] No, that was a chance encounter. I agree with the  Congress president on the need for unity. I am after a Great  National Agreement, GAN, and will talk with the political sector  from an institutional point of view.    [Blanck] What about the labor union sector, which has  refused  to participate in GAN from the outset?    [De Leon] GAN began to be criticized even before its nature  became known. What the various sectors say here is different  from what they say out of the country, however. GAN will work  because the various sectors have no but to reinforce the  government and participate. Either we reach the agreement that  history demands or else everything will go wrong.    [Blanck] One of the government actions that has disturbed  the people and the trade unions more is the issue of  privatization. How are you going to settle that?    [De Leon] More than privatization, I have spoken of breaking  up monopolies, something I am determined to do because it is  advisable for the government. I am aware that we must convince  the unions that breaking up monopolies does not go against them.  What the government wants in this transition period is to  prepare the people, particularly the workers, for a new step.  Wonderful things are coming up, such as NAFTA which will be of  benefit to the country. NAFTA is a fact; we have not made it up.  Guatemala is the only country neighboring the most powerful  economic bloc in the world. That has its benefits and we must  take advantage of them. We must make the people understand the  benefits. We must try it, although there are some groups who do  not like this at all.    [Blanck] Nonetheless, this is happening in all groups. You  say you have attained a commitment inasmuch as the private  sector will comply with its fiscal obligations. However, who  guarantees this will be the case?    [De Leon] We have two great challenges. One is obtaining the  revenue for meeting the goals outlined in the budget,  particularly after the Constitutionality Court ruling which  declared unconstitutional withholding 5 percent. That means we  might not be able to collect 600 million quetzales. The finance  minister has the serious and grave responsibility of achieving  that, instead of 8 centavos, we collect 10 centavos for each  quetzal. One of the ways to do that is to resort to private  enterprise, with whom we are holding conversations.    [Blanck] And how about the other challenge.    [De Leon] To improve the financial situation of the state,  which is critical. We will continue with the austerity program.  We are also going to seek the help of friendly governments,  availing ourselves of the fact the government enjoys credibility  at present. Lastly, we are going to sell everything that is not  operating well.    [Blanck] Does that request for help from abroad entail more  debts?    [De Leon] No, I am referring to the renegotiation of the  debt. To mention a specific case, we are about to solve the  problem of CELGUSA [expansion unknown], as Spain has agreed to  pardon part of the debt, at least 50 percent, without the  government having had to pay a centavo for that renegotiation.    [Blanck] One last question. Your apparent indecision has  deteriorated your image. How do you plan to counter this?    [De Leon] As president, I have had to make decisions, such  as  the one I made last Friday. Some say I am undecided because I  did not pull the deputies by the hair or because I did not close  Congress. I cannot do that. My problem is that my prestige as  human rights ombudsman created great expectations with regard to  my actions. I only hope that the decisions I make when I  implement my policies will help me to recover my image.</p>

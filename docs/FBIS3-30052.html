Michio Watanabe's [former deputy prime minister and foreign  minister] home camp, the Watanabe faction, was like a hornet's  nest from the morning of 24 February. At a meeting of faction  officials in the morning, Bunmei Ibuki, a close associate of  Watanabe, was indignant.    He exclaimed: "If he is going to cooperate with Prime  Minister Hosokawa, I am going to leave the LDP and form a new  party."    Watanabe faction officials were bombarded with inquiries  about the truth of the reported meeting. Antipathy to Watanabe  surged inside the LDP in the belief that the reported top secret  meeting "demonstrates the close relation between Mr. Watanabe  and the Hosokawa administration through his intimate links with  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa."    LDP leaders were critical, saying: "Mr. Watanabe should take  into consideration his position in the party in what he does."    Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, chairman of LDP Political Reform  Headquarters, spoke to a general meeting of the Mitsuzuka  faction on the same day.    He said: "Right now, we should act consistently as an  opposition party. It is important to proceed by taking into  account the overall situation."    Mitsuzuka also told reporters: "This is a critical period  for Mr. Watanabe. I believe he will act maturely." He offered  this comment to preempt possible action on the part of Watanabe.    Meanwhile, Watanabe flatly denied reports of the meeting  with  the prime minister, calling it "an illusory meeting."    At the general meeting of his faction at noon on 24  February,  Watanabe said: "There is nothing wrong with the No. 1 party,  the LDP, exercising a certain measure of influence over the  administration."    His comments argued the case for the importance of unity in  national politics. However, he said emphatically: "It is  completely improbable that I would split the party, or leave you  all to join the cabinet."    There is strong speculation in the LDP the meeting is  evidence that "Prime Minister Hosokawa aims to bring Mr.  Watanabe into the cabinet; he is sounding him out about the post  of deputy prime minister or finance minister."    It is believed that Watanabe does not actually plan to join  the cabinet, but by agreeing to meet with the prime minister,  "he intends to demonstrate his powerful political influence."    However, according to a Watanabe faction official, Watanabe  did not act entirely innocently at the faction's general  meeting. He reported Watanabe as saying: "Now you all know my  worth."    However, it is also true that this reported secret meeting  with the "enemy's commander" -- Prime Minister Hosokawa --  represents a serious setback to "calls for Michi's [Michio  Watanabe] leadership," which have been quite prevalent among the  electoral reform-shy factions in the LDP.    At a time when there are persistent rumors of a "new  Watanabe  party" to be formed through cooperation between Ozawa and  Watanabe in anticipation of the political realignment expected  after the implementation of political reforms, the Watanabe  faction is deeply concerned "this has given rise to unnecessary  suspicions, and added fuel to rumors about the formation of a  new party."    Many believe, "this does not do any good at all for Mr.  Watanabe."</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Travel: Lights on a winter night - David Pilling visits the arctic circle in search of illumination TROMSO. Arctic Norway. 3pm. Pitch black. I leant back and gazed. This was exactly what I had come to see: the Northern Lights, the aurora borealis, flickering against a huge sky. Things had begun in the north-west. A few green bands, like slats of Venetian blind, had appeared above the horizon. Dimming momentarily, they returned stronger than before, spiralling outwards and showering waves of phosphorescence across the night. Trees, which had been enveloped in blackness, revealed gaunt silhouettes against a glowering green expanse. The technician, a burly Norwegian, snapped on the lights to illuminate the domed planetarium ceiling on to which the aurora borealis had been projected. The real Northern Lights were outside, but were obscured by cloud cover. The planetarium opened in 1989 to satisfy tourist cravings for the Arctic's most famous phenomenon. If the real lights were playing hard to get, at least these were reliable. On one occasion, he said, a group had emerged blinking from the planetarium just in time to witness one of the most spectacular displays of the aurora borealis in years. Many visitors are not so lucky. The Northern Lights remain elusive, even here in the world's northernmost city at the heart of their most active zone. I went in late January. Tromso was just emerging from two months of total darkness, a period when many people, ironically, find it almost impossible to sleep. Judging by the packed and numerous bars, the city's sleep-deprived multitudes take solace in Arctic beer - brewed, according to the can, in the world's most northerly brewery. At Pounds 4 a pint, it was certainly approaching the most elevated prices. Many Tromsonians attribute mystical qualities to the Northern Lights. Children often wave at the natural firework show, in spite of parental warnings that this invites the lights to carry them away. I was getting carried away, myself, but not by the lights. I had given up on the aurora borealis and had turned my attention to the attractions of Tromso itself, a city of biscuit-tin-like picturesqueness. January in Tromso is cold and snowy, but not as chilling as one would imagine for a city on the 70th parallel. My flight from London, via Oslo, took four hours. A similar journey south would have landed me in Timbuktu. There was an extraordinary muffled silence about Tromso, blanketed as it was in snow. The only sound was the trickle of water and the occasional crash of melting ice slipping from clapboard houses and pin-sharp church steeples. From my bedroom in the Hotel With (with what I wondered) I could make out the cobweb-thin bridge separating Tromso from the mainland. In the dark, the spindly structure vanished from sight and car headbeams appeared to float slowly over the black watery divide. On the mainland was Tromso cathedral (yes, the world's most northerly), a peculiar girdered affair like the rib-cage of a whale. Mountains stared starkly behind. I had quite forgotten the Northern Lights by now as I padded and skidded across the tiny city centre, sliding from bar to bar. I even squeezed in a visit to the Polar Museum, which occupied my attention for several hours - saving me a small fortune in beers. Inntravel (0439-71111) organises Northern Lights packages departing every Thursday in January and February, returning Sunday. The weekend, including scheduled flights on SAS and accommodation at Hotel With, costs Pounds 399. Accommodation is nominally b &amp; b, but residents can help themselves to coffee and pancakes during the day and a smorgasbord in the evening (worthwhile in view of exorbitant restaurant prices). The Northern Lights, caused by high-speed solar particles hitting the earth's magnetic field, are visible on clear, dark nights between 7pm and 3am. In January and February, you stand roughly a 50 per cent chance of seeing them.</p>

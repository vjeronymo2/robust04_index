The source, who is close to Lebanese Minister of Hydraulic  and Electrical Resources Ilyas Hubayqah, told IRNA here Monday  that the Iranians were delivered to Zionist regime by elements  affiliated with head of Lebanese Maronite Party Samir Geagea  [Ja'Ja'].    He said the hostages who were three Iranian diplomats along  with Islamic republic news agency's photographer were taken as  hostage when they came across a Lebanese paramilitary troops'  checkpoint in 1982. They were taken to occupied Palestine via  sea last year once Geagea was forced to quit his command  headquarters.    Since then, Iranian officials repeatedly have called for  their release, but Lebanese paramilitary troops have refused to  acknowledge that they are holding the four Iranian hostages.    Families of the hostages have also offered documents to the  international bodies, appealing for their release.    Foreign Minister Velayati also in a letter last month called  on his Lebanese counterpart Faris Bouez to probe into the issue.</p>

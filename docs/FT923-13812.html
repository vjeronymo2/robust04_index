			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Rebel capitalises on E German discontent: The ousted CDU chief now heading a bipartisan movement to be launched today MR Peter-Michael Diestel has become an east German folk hero since Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic party (CDU) ousted him as head of the CDU in Brandenburg state. The enigmatic east German politician was catapulted into the vanguard of the still-unnamed east German bipartisan movement, to be launched today, which seeks to tap the widespread discontent in the economically battered region. According to the movement's co-initiator, Mr Gregor Gysi, head of the PDS, the former Communist party, grass-roots committees are to be formed in an attempt to alleviate mass unemployment, de-industrialisation, the destruction of agriculture and the 'humiliation' of east Germans. Politicians of the mainstream parties, particularly the CDU, whose popularity has plummeted among easterners, attacked the new movement for allegedly turning east Germans against west Germans. Mr Diestel claimed it could become the nucleus of a political party. The 40-year-old Mr Diestel was long a thorn in the flesh of the CDU leadership in Bonn for criticising the colonial-style 'subjugation' of east Germany. But the surge in his popularity was nonetheless remarkable, as he was ousted for an interview in which he defended ex-informers of the Stasi state security police against 'one-sided' accusations. While Mr Diestel was criticised for his Stasi remarks by the Social Democrats (SPD) in Brandenburg, who are coalition partners of the CDU, his expulsion was denounced by Mr Manfred Stolpe, the SPD prime minister of the state, as being typical of west German high-handedness. Nearly three-quarters of east German production workers have lost their jobs since 1990 or are on short-time work. The majority languish in retraining or job creation programmes which offer them little future. Psychologically, says Mr Heiner Winkler, an east Berlin journalist, 'they are worse off than before'. Under the Communists, labour was scarce and workers openly complained about their lot without fear of dismissal. 'Now they keep their mouths shut, as everyone is afraid of being sacked,' he says. An entire generation of east Germans above the age of 45 - skilled workers, engineers, academics and officials - has been relegated to the scrap heap. Yet east Germans are reluctant to take to the streets to express their discontent and instead sink deeper into resignation. East German members of the Bundestag previously tried to form bipartisan alliances to press for the interests of their constituents but failed in the face of strong opposition from the west German-controlled parties, which saw a danger in obscuring party lines. Mr Diestel's alliance with his fellow lawyer, Mr Gysi, has alarmed both conservatives and social democrats, who have sought to isolate the PDS. Mr Gysi is a brilliant speaker and tactician and in local elections last May the PDS scored a stunning upset by becoming the strongest party in east Berlin's borough legislatures. But Mr Diestel's erratic behaviour during his rapid rise to prominence in post-Communist east Germany gave him a reputation for inscrutability. As interior minister of the last, freely-elected East German government, he antagonised Bonn officials by employing former senior Stasi officers as advisers. He also argued against opening the Stasi files to the public, predicting that it would lead to acts of violence within families and between neighbours. But it was Mr Diestel's purchase of a big villa belonging to the Interior Ministry which raised questions about his integrity. He bought the lakeside villa for DM193,000 (Pounds 66,500) in July 1990 when it was estimated to be worth nearly DM1m. The German government is demanding that he return the house, which it claims he bought without the approval of the east German parliament and, in effect, sold to himself. Mr Diestel, an avid body-builder, responded to the charges by insisting that he would fight the case to the highest court. Seeking to portray himself as yet another victimised east German, he added that he was in the 'best company' of citizens who also faced eviction from their homes by former west German owners. If Mr Diestel succeeds in his attempt to set up an east German coalition movement, a number of east Germans such as Mr Wolfgang Thierse, the astute deputy chairman of the SPD, believe it would backfire by deepening the mistrust between east and west Germans. 'East German problems will either be solved in an all-German way or not at all,' he cautioned recently. Mr Thierse instead advocated introduction of a minority veto on important legislation affecting the east German states in the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament. On one thing, however, all East German politicians are agreed. Unless the voice of east Germans is heard more loudly in Bonn, the danger will grow of the extreme right wing profiting from their frustrations in future elections.</p>

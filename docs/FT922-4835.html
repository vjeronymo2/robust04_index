			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Mackay set to rule on rent arrears law LORD MACKAY, the Lord Chancellor, is likely to decide by the end of the month on reforms to the controversial law which allows landlords in England and Wales to recover rent due from defaulting tenants from previous tenants of the same property. The pressure imposed by the existing system prompted an announcement yesterday from Grand Metropolitan Estates, the property subsidiary of the UK food and drinks group, that it intends to waive the liability for many of its tenants of public houses. Lord Mackay is likely to recommend that tenants should only guarantee the rents of their immediate successor. The changes, proposed by the Law Commission in 1988, are unlikely to become law before the end of next year. Tenants have been lobbying for a change in the law for the past six months. Some have received rent demands for premises they occupied up to 25 years ago. Landlords have been equally outspoken about the need to preserve a law underpinning the security of a property's rental income. The Conservative party manifesto, which promised to consider putting the Law Commission's proposals into effect, suggested that the changes would apply to new commercial leases. Lord Mackay is likely to recommend that the principles be applied to any assignment that takes place once the legislation is implemented. GrandMet Estates will offer many of its 8,000 tenants the right to waive their liability for rent owed by successors, in return for the payment of 10 per cent of the premium received on assigning a lease. Corporate tenants and those with more than one pub will not be offered the new terms. Mr Bob Williams, chairman of GrandMet Estates, said he did not support a general change in the the law, which he felt was important for long-term property investors. He felt, however, that the existing law was inappropriate for individuals.</p>

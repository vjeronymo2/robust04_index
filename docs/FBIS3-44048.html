			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Norman Patterton] </F>   [Text] Rustenburg, Western Transvaal, Jan 21 SAPA--Forget  casspirs and campari. It were gymslips, heckling, and corn on  the cob for President FW de Klerk on his "beer bus, balloons  bonanza" election trip through Western Transvaal on Friday [21  January].    In Rustenburg, taking a presidential stroll down the street,  he was heckled by African National Congress [ANC] supporters.    But at the Dwarsfontein farm near Ventersdorp, he strolled  down a dirt road hand-in-hand with black children, and later  enjoyed sizzling hot cob on the corn prepared while he had been  making his speech.    At Rustenburg, Mr de Klerk dropped into the National Party  [NP] offices, situated near a gym, where he had a quick work-out.    Slender bimbos capable of dethroning many an international  beauty queen leisurely bided their time in the narrow Rustenburg  Street where the gym is situated, giving passersby the lazy eye  treatment.    Later that evening, Mr de Klerk addressed a banquet attended  by both black and white guests at the Eben Marais Hall.    Shouts of "Viva, NP, Viva" reverberated through the hall,  the  white guests casually adapting themselves to the changed  political circumstances. Anyone shouting "viva" a few years ago  was likely to become the object of intense security police  scrutiny.    En route to Rustenburg, Mr de Klerk hopped aboard the media  bus for an impromptu chat with the press, maize fields flashing  past in the bus window behind him.    Despite laudatory efforts by his election team to lay on  additional telephone lines to remote farms, and accommodating  the press in each possible way, television crew members  complained of being pumped in the ribs by police tough treatment  specialists as they dogged Mr de Klerk's footsteps.    A financial newspaper reporter who coined the "balloon  bonanza" description for the road show initially worried that  more stones were thrown in Fochville than there were balloons,  but his description was validated at the banquet on Friday night  where helium-filled balloons bobbed above the diners.    Amid this festive decor on Friday night, Mr de Klerk warned  Conservative Party [CP] supporters against being led over the  edge to violence and crime.    The CP had had numerous chances to prove its support, he  said, but lost the 1983 referendum, the 1987 election, the 1989  election and the 1992 referendum.    On Saturday he will be in Vryburg -- one of the few  certainties in South African politics.</p>

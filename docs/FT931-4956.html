			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tories cool on investment body ONE IN FIVE Conservative MPs believes government plans to set up a Personal Investment Authority should be scrapped in favour of statutory control of the personal financial services industry. A survey of MPs conducted for IFA Promotion, an organisation representing independent financial advisers, also showed such a course of action would be backed by 83 per cent of Labour MPs and 50 per cent of MPs from all parties. Two thirds of Tory MPs and 40 per cent of MPs from all parties would favour establishing the PIA to allow self-regulation to prove itself. Under current proposals the PIA would be set up under the Securities and Investments Board to regulate the personal financial services sector. The figures were based on a sample of 100 MPs who were interviewed between January 26 and February 10.</p>

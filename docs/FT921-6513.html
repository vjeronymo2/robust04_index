			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Barclays under pressure FINAL results from Barclays yesterday pulled the stock back sharply in an otherwise firm banking sector. The market was particularly disappointed with the growth in costs at Barclays and the level of losses at the US operations. Provisions in the second half grew by 37 per cent in the UK and 34 per cent in the US. Lehman Brothers analyst Mr Robert Law said: 'This must increase the likelihood that the provision figure is likely to remain high.' The shares fell 20 to 374p in very heavy turnover of 18m. In the light of the results, Lehman is looking for Pounds 700m this year (down Pounds 200m), and Pounds 1.2bn in 1993, while Nomura is on Pounds 692m and Pounds 1.214bn and County NatWest Pounds 640m and Pounds 1.1bn. Lloyds Bank and Abbey National were again the focus of attention as recent buy notes on the former and continued sentiment on the latter sent the shares higher. Lloyds added 3 at 412p and Abbey 8 at 305p. National Westminster Bank continued to find favour after its well-received results on Monday, the shares rising 4 to 312p. Midland Bank, which reports today, gained 5 to 239p. US boosts BP The marked difference between London and New York in views on BP's prospects, obvious for more than a week, was reinforced yesterday as analysts in the City of London expressed grave reservations regarding Wall Street's continued support for the stock. BP shares attracted heavy US buying in late dealings in London yesterday. Following an analysts meeting in New York, at which BP gave reassurances about the dividend, Mr Todd Bergman of Goldman Sachs repeated his buy recommendation. But this view that BP shares are now cheap and that the dividend is safe contrasts sharply with opinions in London. When BP failed to raise its quarterly dividend earlier this month, analysts in London questioned whether the total payout for the year could be held against the background of falling crude oil prices. Nevertheless, after Goldman maintained its earnings estimate of Dollars 4.25 per BP American Depositary Receipt, which is at the top end of Wall Street estimates, the shares found fresh support. In London the stock closed 5 1/2 higher at 264 1/2 p, rebounding from a low of 256p touched before the US market opened. Turnover was a hefty 34m shares. Glaxo reverse The announcement late in the session that Denmark's Office of Fair Trading was asking the European Commission to investigate Glaxo on suspicion of abusing a dominant market position knocked the share price. The pharmaceuticals company had been up 14p at one stage but the news that the prices of three new Glaxo medicines for asthma and migraine were causing concern among Danish health authorities sent the shares back to close only a penny up at 794p. They also fell in New York, where they are traded as American Depositary Receipts, in active trading. The ADRs were down by Dollars  1/2 on turnover of more than 2.5m (the equivalent of 5m shares) in early trading. Pharmaceuticals analyst Mr Didier Cowling of Nomura Research said yesterday: 'If Denmark manages to convince the EC, Glaxo could have a problem.' Lonrho upset Expectations of a disappointing annual report from Lonrho, and belief that the trading conglomerate may terminate its UK Audi/Volkswagen franchise, prompted traders to mark down the price of the shares at the start of dealing yesterday. Then, when the annual report fulfilled the market's financial concern by disclosing that the poor preliminary figures had been boosted by a Pounds 33m asset sale, the shares fell further. They closed 9 down at 121p, contrasting with a strong stock market, on turnover of 9.3m shares, or about twice average daily volume. The stock has lost more than 100p since November. Warburg warns Shares in merchant bank SG Warburg fell steeply as the group issued a trading statement which warned that profits for the second half of the year would be below those of the first half. However, the group said pre-tax profits would be above the level of the same period last year - putting the figure at between Pounds 155m and Pounds 178m for the year. This was only slightly below most analysts' forecasts, and many felt that the drop of 36 to 538p was overdone. Kleinwort Benson produced results at the lower end of analysts' ranges and retreated 11 to 265p. Property shares were again weak as two brokers issued gloomy reports on the sector. County NatWest said gearing in the sector had risen from 53 per cent to 78 per cent over the year, and that any prospect of a revival was being stifled by indecision prior to the general election. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew also found little to be optimistic about, and recommended a move out of Great Portland Estates, off 4 at 156p, Brixton Estates, down 3 at 155p, and Land Securities, 1 off at 439p. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi was active, with turnover of more than 31m boosted by two large blocks of shares placed at 16p in late trading. The stock closed steady at 16 3/4 p. SmithKline Beecham was held back by analysts' downgradings following the announcement of full-year figures on Tuesday. SG Warburg cut its 1992 profits estimate by Pounds 15m to Pounds 1.115bn and Nomura reduced its earnings growth forecast for the company from 15 per cent by at least 1 percentage point. The shares gained only 2 to 917p, although the units rose 30 to 4210p. Strong US buying of electricity generators left National Power 5 1/2 higher at 220p and PowerGen ahead 8 1/2 at 232p. Vodafone advanced 8 to 364p in busy turnover of 5.9m after a series of presentations to US institutions. Electronics group Unitech surged 17 to 225p as speculation mounted over the next move by its two large Swiss shareholders, which on Monday announced that takeover talks had broken down. Oil company Lasmo fell to 196p on news that Smith New Court had placed a line of 4m shares with various institutions, but closed only 2 down at 199p. Shell followed BP higher, rising 5 to 447p. Grand Metropolitan lost 15 to 932p as analysts cut profit forecasts. Kleinwort Benson lowered its estimate to Pounds 398m from Pounds 472m for the first half of this year, and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew revised to Pounds 377m from Pounds 413m. Switching within the food sector boosted Ranks Hovis McDougall and United Biscuits but hit Northern Foods, as investors looked for shares which have lagged the market in what is regarded as a safe haven sector at a time of political uncertainty. Ranks Hovis climbed 8 1/2 to 214 1/2 p and United Biscuits 8 to 416p, as Northern Foods lost 8 to 560p. Retailer and drugs manufacturer Macarthy rose 17 to 316p after the Monopolies and Mergers Commission cleared rival bids for the company from UniChem and Lloyds Chemists. If Lloyds, the main contender, uses the same terms as before - one Lloyds share plus 21p - its offer would be worth about 360p a share. It shed 5 to 340p. Wholesaler UniChem firmed 2 to 203p. It is expected to wait and see what decision Lloyds takes. Also, in December it announced that it had bought pharmaceutical chain E. Moss for Pounds 27m and it may be hesitant to return to the acquisition trail so soon. A presentation to institutions by merchant bank Kleinwort Benson on the hotel sector left Queens Moat Houses ahead 3 1/2 at 82p. Turnover was a heavy 10m. Glynwed International eased a penny to 210p. Panmure Gordon issued a sell note. Nervousness ahead of today's figures sent Williams Holdings down 4 to 325p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991/92 NEW HIGHS (115).

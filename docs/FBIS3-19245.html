This is  even the case along the Rhine between eastern France and  southwestern Germany. "Meaningful regional politics here must be  politics that transcend the border," says Lord Mayor Boehme of  Freiburg. The western limits of this city in Baden extend to  within three kilometers of the Rhine and France. Stuttgart, the  capital city in the Swabian part of the land, is located 80  kilometers by road to the east, already far enough, it appears,  for estrangement and indifference to have set in.    "Still today, I feel that it is a gift of history and a  great  stroke of luck," Boehme writes, that he is received "as a  friend" in the department store in Colmar or in the city hall in  Mulhouse or Strasbourg, and that he is able to discuss "our  problems here without official posturing." Again and again,  however, agency heads in Wuerttemberg, including some very  capable ministers, have interfered with their friends' efforts.  "Why should we give the French money to boot?" one of them said  recently.    Also the blissful coexistence of the German and French  neighbors will suffer if a price is put on it. Municipal leaders  and representatives from the German Upper Rhine region and  Alsace recently held another of their periodic meetings. At  issue was a project affecting both these regions which was to  have cost 50,000 German marks [DM]. According to the notes taken  by the lord mayor of Freiburg, the German side was represented  by members of the land government in Stuttgart and their  responsible officials, important people, since they administer  the finances "and in the final analysis decide on the fate of  the projects." Representing the French side were, above all,  Alsatian mayors and their employees, in many cases "intelligent  and distinguished" men, "fluent in both languages and at home in  both cultures."    "Well now, Mister Mayor!" Cautiously, at first, the pros and  cons of the project had been discussed. At some point, however,  senior public servant Mueller from Stuttgart could not remain  seated any longer--he jumped up, fixed his eyes on the aged  mayor of Colmar, Gerrer, and bellowed out: "Wouldn't just 30,000  do the trick?" The reference was to German marks. "I felt  ashamed," recalls administrative chief Boehme, who was also a  Bundestag representative for ten years and then a parliamentary  state secretary in Bonn.    All this might perhaps not even have been necessary. In  1945,  the French had marched into the regions of the Upper Rhine and  along the section of the river between Basel and Lake Constance,  and this had brought not only privations. "We young people,"  recalls Boehme, who was born in Konstanz, "at that time ventured  into the realm of French culture, a realm which from then one  kept everyone from our generation firmly in its grip." And now  the European internal market is offering opportunities which  transcend the old boundaries. But business deals are not  everything. To this day, European progress remains an  administrative snail. The truth is that mayors, representatives,  and district councillors from Baden feel closer to Strasbourg  than to Stuttgart. Here, too, lies the serious crux of the  "Baden question," a question which has now come back with a  vengeance in the land.    Freiburg is now growing and flourishing. When the  smokestacks  in Swabia were still vying with each other to see which one  could put out more smoke, the services metropolis in Baden had  been smiled at condescendingly. But it was precisely the small  number of manufacturing trades which in the end made the  community less dependent on economic fluctuations. Where until  recently the city's effluents were still seeping into the  ground, a new city district is being built, ten thousand people  are to find housing there, soon the 200,000th inhabitant will be  welcomed to the city. The city is going places, but where is  there to go with its belly up against the Rhine?    Karlsruhe is flourishing. With no-nonsense steadfastness,  Lord Mayor Seiler brought an economic boom to the old royal  seat, the likes of which very few German cities have experienced  during the last ten years. But what else is there? In Karlsruhe  is the royal residence, so the song of the Badeners goes, "in  Mannheim, the factory." Mannheim, in northern Baden, will have  to take care that it will be left with a few factories. Rastatt  is bracing itself against decline, and Baden-Baden, once an  internationally known spa, is losing its luster.    One's own efforts, even the most forceful, are now  increasingly encountering limits, complains Professor Seiler, a  political economist respected not only in Karlsruhe. "We are  being deprived of the centrality to which we are entitled."  Early on, already, numerous land agencies, including free-lance  chambers, municipal associations, and industrial organizations,  were pulled out and moved to Stuttgart. It is true, Seiler  stated, that the state theaters in Stuttgart claim more public  funds than those in Karlsruhe and Mannheim combined. The flow  into the Swabian interior has become ever stronger, he stated:  DM1.4 billion of the land's money is to be spent on the  expansion of the airport on Swabian soil. DM5 million, possibly  a little more, is to be made available for a regional airport in  northern Baden (in Soellingen).    The list is a long one, and fiscal and tax law expert Boehme  has no desire to go through it in detail. But he does want to  talk about "centralistic stupidities." The central Neckar  region, with its classical machine construction and automobile  and automotive supplier industries, "all this is out," his  agency maintains. For some time, already, decentralized,  flexible structures have been required. What is needed more and  more is an intelligent production that is compatible with the  "environment and human beings."    "This here," attorney Boehme, referring to the Rhine basin,  is convinced, "this is the future." Here only the West European  card can be trump. It is in the hands of the Germans and the  French. Why does one not play this card?    In 1953, Baden and Wuerttemberg were joined as states,  naturally for reasons of expediency. As late as 1970, it had  taken a plebiscite to placate the "old Baden" resistance that  was still flaring up against the hyphenated makeshift  construction of Baden-Wuerttemberg. But the land has never  really become one--the financial and mental differences  prevailing there, and the pride taken in these differences, have  historical roots. The wish for more "freedom" and "autonomy" was  heard much sooner in the grand duchy of Baden than in the  rigidly regulated state of the Wuerttemberg kings. The promises  of the French Revolution had their effect along the Rhine. Since  then the Swabians have been viewed not only by the residents of  Baden as efficient, but sometimes also grimly determined,  workers. "Work imperialists," Theodor Eschenburg once lovingly  called them. The residents of Baden see themselves mainly as  quieter, more creative, and more imaginative. But again and  again they have also been on the losing end, and not just in the  dual confederation. They have always been willing to give in,  even if only for a good glass of wine.    Small occurrences in everyday municipal life in western  European border regions are sometimes more revealing than  polished papers of the government. Lord Mayor Boehme of Freiburg  now plans to concern himself more with contacts with Alsatian  politicians and with the project of a "Bi-Lingua-Zone," a  project that is to promote linguistic understanding at least  directly along the Rhine. Itinerant lecturer Oskar Lafontaine,  who in other respects is not easily irritated, expressed  concerns recently while in the region that Germany and France  might drift apart permanently. Not far from Freiburg, in Colmar,  Prime Minister Balladur recently raised his bushy eyebrows,  sounded warnings against the creation of cross-border  dependencies, and called on the residents of eastern France to  strengthen the nation above all.    The German-French border region--where the postulates of  increased municipal capabilities to create and act, of autonomy,  and of "subsidiarity" would have had a special meaning--feels  itself without an appropriate role: Even along the upper Rhine,  the "Europe of regions" has remained an icon. That, too, has  caused old dissatisfactions to resurface in the extreme  southwestern region of many.</p>

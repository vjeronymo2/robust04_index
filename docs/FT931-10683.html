			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Arts: Bewitching sisters At the Royal National's Cottesloe Theatre is a literally bewitching play for children. The Day After Tomorrow by the Dutchman Roel Adam, translated by Noel Clark, is billed as being directed at four to seven-year olds, but I think that the RNT could realistically cast its net much wider at the upper end. The most striking feature is the set: a huge arm chair, designed by Kate Burnett, which also serves as a cottage and part of a forest. The chair is so big that two sisters sleep on top of the arms; the underpart of the arms serves as tunnels. The sisters are living there because one day some soldiers burn their parents' cottage to the ground, but beyond that there is nothing sinister, certainly nothing frightening. The girls quarrel as sisters do. Alice, the elder, tends to bossiness: Jenny, the younger, can seem stubborn, largely because she resents her sister's seniority. What they really want is a baby brother, which is eventually is what they get. Their pursuit involves a trip through the forest, a sisterly dispute over who wants white or brown bread sandwiches, a separation, and a meeting with a witch and a fairy. The brother is already there but does not want to be born because that would mean leaving the land of music. An elf-like figure he constantly plays the violin; the sisters tempt him into life by taking to the strings themselves and all ends happily. There are no hidden depths or secret meanings, but the acting by Vikki Pepperdine as Alice and Kate Somerby as Jenny is consistently good and the story is intriguing enough to hold the attention of all ages throughout. The piece runs for just over an hour without an interval and the production, directed by Anthony Clark, is supported by the Wolfson Foundation.</p>

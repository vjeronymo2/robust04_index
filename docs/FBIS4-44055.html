			<p>BFN     [Text] Italy is one of the countries which may take part in  the UN mission in Rwanda. Mario De Scalzi interviewed Defense  Minister Cesare Previti a few minutes ago. He asked him what  the Italian Government's position is.    [Begin recording] [Previti] We have said we are available  for  an international mission -- either sponsored by the Western  European Union [WEU] or the United Nations -- and we can confirm  that. The mission should be very international. The commandment  should clearly be given to someone at a supernational level [as  heard]. The goals should be peace and humanitarian aid.    [De Scalzi] So a mission like the French one is not feasible  according to you?    [Previti] The United Nations has given its support to the  French intervention. It must be a short-term intervention  before there is a wider UN intervention. I hope these plans  materialize as soon as possible. It appears that it is more and  more necessary to do what the prime minister has said more than  once: There should be a task-force capable of intervening on  behalf of the United Nations or the WEU in places like Rwanda  where the disaster is getting worse by the minute.

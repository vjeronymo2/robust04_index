			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Labour hit by frontbench shake-up row The last stage of Mr Tony Blair's shake-up of Labour's frontbench team is being delayed by a row about his plans to restructure the whips' office. Mr Blair was expected to complete his new line-up yesterday by announcing the names of several appointments to the whips' office from the 1992 intake of Labour MPs. But the announcement had to be cancelled after Mr Don Dixon, the deputy chief whip, complained that he had not been consulted. Mr Dixon, who apparently discovered the proposed changes by accident, has demanded time to consider Mr Blair's proposals and is not expected to respond until Monday. He said last night: 'I am pleased that the whips' office is getting more recognition and more people. But I am not pleased about the fact that I was not consulted about what is happening.' Mr Dixon, the MP for Jarrow, is in a strong position to defy Mr Blair because he is an elected official of the parliamentary Labour party. He cannot be sacked or moved against his wishes. Regarded as a consummate backstairs 'fixer', Mr Dixon has been elected deputy chief whip every year since 1987, reflecting his popularity among Labour MPs. The dispute is unlikely to prevent Mr Blair from pushing through the bulk of his planned shake-up, which is intended to give the whips' office a fresh role as a training ground for promising MPs. However, a senior Labour MP said that the clash with Mr Dixon was likely to be seen as further evidence of the inexperience of Mr Blair's close advisers, many of whom have little experience of Westminster. The Labour party's popularity has risen to its highest level ever, according to an opinion poll published in The Times newspaper today. The poll, conducted by MORI last weekend, puts Labour's rating at 57 per cent, up from 54 per cent in late September. The Conservatives remain unchanged at 25 per cent and the Liberal Democrats are down to 14 per cent from a previous 17 per cent.</p>

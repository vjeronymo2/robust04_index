			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Leukaemia linked to virus Strong evidence linking childhood leukaemia with infection is published in the British Medical Journal today, Clive Cookson writes. Scientists at the Cancer Research Campaign's epidemiology unit in Oxford found that the exodus of more than 1m children from London and other big cities during the second world war resulted in a significant increase in leukaemia in rural Britain. Deaths from the disease in the four years after the war were 47 per cent higher in rural areas that received the largest numbers of urban evacuees. CRC researchers believe that 'population mixing' during the war exposed rural children to city children carrying the unknown infection - probably a virus.

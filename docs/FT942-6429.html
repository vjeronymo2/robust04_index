			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Tapie: man of the moment in France The assembled Eurosceptics at a recent Paris rally of Sir James Goldsmith's L'Autre Europe movement greeted the video images of the conservative and socialist party leaders with mild derision. But when the permanently tanned face of Mr Bernard Tapie appeared, the crowd went wild with jeers, boos and hisses. Love him or loathe him - and it is hard to find anyone in France who admits to being indifferent to him - Mr Tapie, 51, the leader of the left-wing Energie Radicale movement, is the man of the moment in the French campaign for the European elections. Thanks to his leadership Energie Radicale, once a motley assortment of activists with little more than 2 per cent of the votes, now scores 10 per cent in the opinion polls. Mr Tapie himself has raced ahead of the other left-wing contenders to claim third place in the polls for next year's presidential elections. He fares even better among young voters by tying for first place alongside Mr Edouard Balladur, the centre-right prime minister. His success is all the more surprising in the light of his financial and legal problems. Mr Tapie, who was born in a poor Paris suburb but made a fortune in the 1980s by buying bankrupt companies, has sold off his business empire leaving a bitter legacy of heavy debts and court cases. Olympique-Marseille, the football club that he groomed into the first-ever French winner of the European Cup, is reeling from a recent match-rigging scandal and faces relegation to the second division. Mr Tapie is currently embroiled in no fewer than six judicial investigations. Credit Lyonnais, his bank, is so concerned about his financial situation that it has given him until Thursday to repay FFr450m (Pounds 52.4m) of his FFr1.2bn debts. If Mr Tapie fails to pay, Credit Lyonnais will seize the contents of his Paris home. It recently sent a bailif to take an inventory of the contents of his Paris town house only to discover that its own private detectives had previously filmed the removal of some of the most valuable objects. The prospective Euro MP said he had lent a few 'favourite pieces' to his mother-in-law. His legal and financial plight is so dire that Mr Tapie's critics claim the only reason he is standing in the European elections is the hope that yet another layer of parliamentary immunity might help keep him out of prison. Yet his personal problems seem only to have enhanced his standing among his supporters and to have helped, rather than hindered, his progress in opinion polls. 'The public sees Bernard Tapie as an adventurer, as part of modern French folklore,' says Serge Raffy, a political commentator on Nouvel Observateur, the current affairs magazine. 'To them he's one of the few people who dares to wave two fingers at the establishment. Every time Credit Lyonnais, the legal system or the tax authorities gang up against him, it just adds to the Tapie myth.' Mr Tapie has always styled himself as a man of the people. He is known for his love of fast cars, big boats, flashy clothes and for devotion to his football club. Whereas most French politicians pride themselves on peppering their speeches with obscure literary or historical references, he is notorious for livening up television chat shows by threatening to throttle his opponents. His image has made him an anathema to the Paris political establishment. Mr Franz-Olivier Giesbert, editor of the conservative Le Figaro, recently described Mr Tapie as the 'prince of swagger' and 'a loud-mouthed guttersnipe'. But the same earthy style has made him one of the few public figures that ordinary people can relate to in a country where the upper ranks of finance, industry and politics are filled with the haut bourgeois products of the snooty Grandes Ecoles. Besides some people actually like Mr Tapie. He recently topped a poll as the man most French women wanted to go to bed with. Mr Tapie's street chic has proved invaluable during his current crises. Each time that Credit Lyonnais has stepped up the pressure over the past few weeks, he has been swift to style himself as the victim of an establishment plot. His conspiracy theories have struck a chord with the public. A poll in last Sunday's Journal du Dimanche newspaper showed that nearly a third of the electorate think he is being hounded by the establishment. Yet even Mr Tapie seems to be finding it difficult to wriggle out of Credit Lyonnais's clutches. He often claimed in past crises that all he really wanted was to sail away on the Phocea, his luxury yacht. But the Phocea is now the subject of a tax probe and is also threatened with seizure by Credit Lyonnais as security for Mr Tapie's outstanding loans.</p>

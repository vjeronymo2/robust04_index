			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Letter: Wrong angle on short-term disturbance Sir, Your odd-angled, close-up photograph of machinery (February 15, page 7) is about as fair and sensible an illustration of 'unsightly opencast mining' as a below-the-rim photograph of an unflushed lavatory would demonstrate the poor quality of bathroom decor and design. The serious environmental problems of deep mining should not be ignored. These include the disposal of colliery spoil, subsidence, and the need for high-level equipment. By contrast, the comparatively short-term disturbance arising from opencasting is followed by restoration which often recreates landscapes that have disappeared as a result of long-term agriculture.

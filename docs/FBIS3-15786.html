			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksander Lebed, commander in chief of the </F> 14th Russian Army, by Rostislav Khotin and Dmitriy Mosiyenko in  Tiraspol; date not given: "Not Long Ago We Were Citizens of One  State, Therefore We Can Gain an Understanding More Quickly and  Easily Than Any Americans, Germans, and Englishmen..."]    [Text] General Lebed, 43, is one of the most prominent  stars on the military horizon of the former Soviet Union. A  regular officer with 25 years of experience and an Afghan War  veteran, he consolidated his position and influence both in  Moldova and Moscow during the armed conflict between Kishinev  and Tiraspol in 1992. This is why he can take the liberty of  making judgments that do not become military officials, and  particularly commanders of foreign troops... People have  different opinions about General Lebed, ranging from a boorish  soldier to a man capable of replacing Pavel Grachev. General  Lebed gave an interview on the eve of legislative elections in  Moldova at the 14th Russian Army Headquarters in Tiraspol,  sitting under the Russian flag and a large poster depicting the  Kremlin. We preserved the general's style of speech throughout  the interview.    [KIEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI] Comrade commander, Moldovan President  Mircea Snegur said he would press for the complete withdrawal of  Russian troops from Moldova in 1994...    [Lebed] I got you. As they say, desires do not always match  abilities. When I am asked whether it is good when the Army of  one state is on the territory of another state, I answer "no."  Should it be pulled out? Yes, it should.    When it should be pulled out is a separate question. This  should be done when all political and economic conditions for  the pullout are in place; when, for example, one can get a  sufficient number of trains here and then dispatch them to new  stationing sites so that local women do not assault our units,  as was the case before... Those conditions are not yet met! Why  not? Just because a year and a half of peace brought no  results; negotiations are in a deadlock with no progress in  sight. As for economic conditions, Shevardnadze from Georgia  babbled much about them -- hundreds of thousands of officers are  left without jobs, apartments, and any prospects for the future.  This kind of withdrawal is even more unacceptable. There is  also a diplomatic side to the whole problem. What would Ukraine  say, if I started to transport weapons and ammunition through  its territory? After all, its railroads will be jammed with  dangerous cargo. There is a technical side to this problem.  Considering the railroads and loading sites available and the  huge amount of weapons, this transportation would require two  solid years of around-the-clock work -- day and night, and no  holidays... So, who can ever talk here about the summer of  1994? Besides, you cannot utilize the ammunition here. They  would not listen to any arguments, and only go like, Get out of  here and period. I think it is an election campaign ploy.    [KIEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI] Some politicians -- in particular,  Brigitte Schultz who is the leader of a NATO group observing  elections in Moldova -- believe that the presence of the 14th  Russian Army in the Dniester region will complicate Russia's  participation in the "Partnership for Peace."    [Lebed] Brigitte Schultz is no authority to me. Besides,  women should move their butts out of this place, and not stick  their noses into the dog's turd. She is threatening us? Let  her come down here and try to pull this Army out. The former  Soviet Army withdrew from Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland,  Germany, Mongolia, and Cuba. This was the first wave, and then  the second one followed. The withdrawal of the Western Group of  Troops is to be completed by 1 September, and the Northwestern  Group of Troops is now being withdrawn from the Baltics. All  this crush of officers, warrant officers, military equipment,  and wild homeless officers... With a severe economic crisis  crippling Russia and Ukraine, this problem will not be solved  quickly. And it must be solved in a civilized manner. When the  British Rhein Army had to be pulled out from Germany two years  ago, the British estimated that this would require nine years.  Germans checked it out and agreed. This is what I call a  civilized approach.    [KIEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI] Who could replace the 14th Army in  the future? UN peacekeeping forces, maybe?    [Lebed] Let us take it for granted that not long ago, we  were citizens of one state, therefore we can come to terms more  quickly and easily than any Americans, Germans, or Englishmen.  Take, for example, the trilateral peacekeeping posts of  Russians, Dniester Russians, and Moldovans. If they want to get  smashed, they do it together, so there are no ethnic problems  among them. Their commanders know each other, too, because they  used to serve in the same army.    A steady balance of forces has been established in this  region. If you drastically disturb it... For example, suppose  there is no 14th Army as of tomorrow. This will immediately  instigate a temptation to solve long-standing problems in one  fell swoop. Someone will have to fill the vacuum. No action,  however tough and swift, can be victorious. That is a tough  place around here -- everyone would always owe something to  everyone. European borders were drawn and redrawn after  numerous wars. Here, you can prove that white is either white  or black, depending on how old your map is. This is why this  place can become another Yugoslavia. Personally, I don't see any  possibility as to how to pull my Army out of this region. Even  if someone new comes tomorrow to lead it, he would not see,  either.    The humiliatingly short record time for withdrawal from  foreign countries often brought about a problem of, say, how to  dissolve a division in two months. Servicemen were asked then  where they came from. Are you guys from Tiraspol? Come to the  14th Army commander, he will find you a place. As a result, 51  percent of officers and 79 percent of warrant officers in my  Army come from this region. This is one whole jumble -- the  Army is Russian, its commander's last name is Lebed, his combat  deputy is Melnychuk, and his logistic deputy is Perepadya. All  of them have numerous relatives in nearby Ukraine. Generally  speaking, this is paranoia that needs to be blown away as soon  as possible. Ukrainians, Russians, Belarusians are all Slavs  with one fate, blood, and faith. We should think of what unites  us, and not the other way around. What we are doing right now  is separating them as Siamese twins that have two heads and one  body. If separated, both of them will be nothing but hideous  freaks. So, we are working now on the freaks.    [KIEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI] What are the relations between the  14th  Army command and the Dniester leadership?    [Lebed] Relations with the Dniester Republic of Moldova  [PRM]  have never been cloudless. They introduced some dumb money and  meddled in someone else's business by sending some hundred  soldiers to the White House in October. They bring in some  citizenship and pass weird laws, privatizing the 30-km-stretch  of the Russian gas pipe line in the region. They took under  their jurisdiction the air space over their republic without  even having an airport and planes. I refused to be a PRM deputy  because I am against the boorish interference with affairs of  the state that I serve. It is up to Russia what president and  parliament to elect. No Swedes, Czechs, or Dniester residents  have the right to decide this.</p>

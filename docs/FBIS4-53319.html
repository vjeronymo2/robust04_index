			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, 17 May KYODO -- The Federation of Economic  Organizations (Keidanren) proposed Tuesday [17 May] that an  advisory council for the prime minister be established to study  drastic reforms of government-backed financial services,  including postal savings and postal insurance.    The top Japanese business organization made the proposal in  a  report on reforming Japan's government-backed financial system.    It said a further expansion of the postal savings and postal  insurance services should be avoided since they receive various  forms of government protection.    The report also said Japan's future monetary policies should  be based more on the nation's money supply and land and other  asset values, not just interest rates and price trends as at  present.    It offered trial calculations on the effects of the money  supply on economic growth and rises in land and stock prices.    The report noted the money supply grew at an annual rate of  more than 10 percent in the "bubble economy" years between  fiscal 1987 and 1990.    It said if that increase rate was curbed to the average  nominal growth rate of 7 percent for gross national product in  the period, the year-to-year rise in land prices in Tokyo and  five other big Japanese cities in fiscal 1990 would have been  limited to 0.6 percent, instead of the actual 11 percent.</p>

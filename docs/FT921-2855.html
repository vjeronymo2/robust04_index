			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Appeal to voters on eve of S African reform poll BLACK and white leaders warned white South Africans yesterday that turmoil and destruction lay ahead if they failed to endorse President FW de Klerk's reform strategy in today's referendum. 'The referendum is a date with destiny,' Mr de Klerk said in a final appeal to voters as township tensions heightened in advance of today's poll of South Africa's 3.3m whites. The death toll since the referendum campaign began three weeks ago yesterday rose to more than 270 as further violence broke out in townships around Johannesburg and Durban. Street battles erupted in Soweto and Alexandra near Johannesburg, where dusk-to-dawn curfews have been imposed. At least 14 people have died in the two townships since Sunday. Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, urged whites to vote yes. A no vote would be a 'tragic mistake' which would 'give rise to a great deal of turmoil, perhaps unprecedented', Mr Mandela told a local radio station. Any attempt by the rightwing Conservative party to re-introduce apartheid would 'be resisted with all the power at our command,' he said. Mr Pik Botha, foreign minister, in one of the bluntest speeches the campaign, painted a bleak picture of the consequences of voting against the reform process. 'On one hand, you can vote for your own destruction . . . on the other hand, you can vote for the continuation of the negotiation process,' he said. Mr Botha told a lunchtime meeting in Johannesburg's City Hall: 'I predict not a single government in the world would recognise a government based on the policies of the Conservative party.' Dr Zach de Beer, leader of the liberal Democratic party, echoing Mr Botha warned that a no vote would 'cause immediate large scale internal conflict'. Dr Andries Treurnicht, leader of the Conservative party, used the last day of campaigning to stress one of the right wing's most effective points: voters were being asked to endorse negotiations which would lead to a new constitution, but would not be given a chance to decide whether they approved it. His party has tried to persuade undecided voters that a yes vote gives the government a blank cheque. 'I urge the white nation to say 'no' - and opt for a second chance to vote. An election will give you the opportunity to examine each party's policy in detail.' Results of the referendum will be released tomorrow.</p>

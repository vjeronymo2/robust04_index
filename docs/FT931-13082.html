			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chicago and New York exchanges plan merger TWO OF North America's largest futures exchanges yesterday announced that they had agreed in principle to join operations, perhaps setting the stage for other mergers as mature US futures markets struggle for economic survival. The Boards of Directors of the Chicago Board of Trade and New York's Commodity Exchange (Comex) have agreed in principle to affiliate. Under the plan, the CBoT would become the sole owner of the Comex, which has been suffering financially in recent years. The Comex is the US's fourth largest futures exchange, and its largest metals exchange. The CBoT is the biggest exchange in the country, with active trade in agricultural and financial products. The marriage would allow the Comex to continue to trade its hallmark precious metals futures while the CBoT would maintain its separate interest rate and agricultural contracts. However, Mr Patrick Arbor, new chairman of the CBoT, said other contracts could be traded jointly, with mutual access for both memberships. Under the plan, which still must be ratified by members of both exchanges, the Comex and CBoT would combine their trade clearing operations and marketing and administrative activities. The pact was suggested to the two exchanges by Mr Richard Sandor, a CBoT board member and the mastermind of the exchange's first interest rate futures contracts. Exchange officials said the deal took less than 10 days to consummate, leaving the impression it was a shotgun marriage. Mr Arbor said Comex was on a solid financial footing, with Dollars 18 million in net worth, Dollars 12 million in cash on hand, and no outstanding debt. The terms of the deal left the CBoT with 'virtually no risk'. The merger, as presented, would be financed out of present and future Comex earnings, he said. Ms Donna Redel, Comex head, emphasised that the plan provided broad economies for the two exchanges, and would improve their competitiveness overseas and against over-the-counter markets domestically. The pact represents a coup for the CBoT, which stands to garner the trading power of the Comex's 1,000 members, as well as precious metals contracts that it has been unable to sustain in Chicago.</p>

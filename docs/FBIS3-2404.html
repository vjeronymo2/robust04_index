During this final stage, workers are expected to repair and  reconstruct ancillary parts of the Potala Palace, including the  Western Buddhist Scriptural Printing House and the numerous  turrets on the ancient city wall.    Located on a hill in the heart of the Lhasa River Valley,  the  13- story palace, with 10,000 separate buildings, houses a great  number of precious cultural relics as well as eight pearl-inlaid  and gold- plated stupas holding the remains of the fifth and  seventh to 13th Dalai Lamas.    The renovation of the whole Potala Palace started in October  1989. The entire reconstruction work, which is carried out in  four main phases, will cost the central government 33 million  yuan.    After four periods of repair work, reconstruction of all  principal parts of the palace has been completed and has passed  appraisal by experts.    Palace maintenance workers have now been working hard on the  restoration of cultural relics in each of the halls. Some of  the halls have been opened to visitors and believers.    Besides working out a set of comprehensive, scientific,  strict management rules and regulations, local officials said  that they planned to install some advanced security equipment to  help prevent fires, guard against theft, give alarms, and carry  out visual supervision through closed circuit TV.    The officials added that the final stage of the restoration  is expected to be completed at the end of next July. A grand  ceremony will be held in early August to mark the completion of  the entire rebuilding project.</p>

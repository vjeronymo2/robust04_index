			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Sydney hit by News Corp preference issue Wall Street's overnight fall unnerved some Pacific Rim markets, while others were driven by domestic influences. Tokyo was closed for a public holiday. SYDNEY finished slightly lower, hit by a fall in the share price of News Corp as it began trading its preference share issue. The All Ordinaries index slipped 2.1 to 2,009.1 in turnover of ADollars 407m. Brokers said the market opened easier, mainly on weakness in News Corp, and failed to recover, although News Corp regained its balance, adding 42.3 cents at ADollars 5.85 after being adjusted for the preference share issue. The media shares sub-index gained 2.1 per cent at 12,321.0, although Fairfax eased 3 cents to ADollars 2.70. In a mixed mining sector, CRA declined 14 cents to ADollars 18.62, MIM finished steady at ADollars 2.91 and WMC was 2 cents firmer at ADollars 2.91. WELLINGTON ended slightly higher in very heavy turnover, boosted by Brierley Investments' raid on Wilson and Horton, publisher of New Zealand's biggest circulation paper, the Auckland based New Zealand Herald. The NZSE-40 Capital index put on 8.70 at 2,117.43. Brierley's purchase of 25m Wilson shares, amounting to a 25 per cent stake, for about NZDollars 243m at NZDollars 9.50 a share, lifted turnover to NZDollars 297.7m and overshadowed Telecom's first-half results. Brierley was 2 cents up at NZDollars 1.25, while Wilson and Horton rose NZDollars 1.25 to NZDollars 9.50. The move had a beneficial effect on Wilson and Horton's opposition, Independent Newspapers, which firmed 40 cents to NZDollars 5.30. Telecom, which had earlier reported an increase in first-half profits to NZDollars 293m from NZDollars 251.4m, dipped 3 cents to NZDollars 5.65. KUALA LUMPUR returned after Wednesday's holiday to further selling forced on clients unable to meet margin calls. This left the market 2.5 per cent lower, the composite index losing 27.12 at 1,066.46, with Wall Street's weak trend also unnerving some investors. Some analysts said that although market sentiment was weak, they expected further dips to bring buyers back. HONG KONG saw some of its early gains erased on profit-taking but the Hang Seng index still finished 40.20 higher at 9,491.96. Turnover was HKDollars 2.4bn, slightly better than Wednesday's HKDollars 2.2bn. Property, banking and construction issues rose on news of an imminent airport funding agreement. Cheung Kong appreciated 30 cents to HKDollars 36.70, Henderson Land 50 cents to HKDollars 50.50 and Hongkong Land 15 cents to HKDollars 19.70. HSBC Holdings advanced 50 cents to HKDollars 90.50 and Hang Seng Bank 75 cents to HKDollars 56.50. SEOUL closed broadly firmer in spite of a further Won33bn of sales by the securities market stabilisation fund, the composite index adding 11.99 at 1,117.73. Gainers outpaced losers by 565 to 314, with 327 stocks going limit up. Medium-priced, large-capitalisation shares were in demand. Kia Motors rose the day's limit, Won800, to Won17,900 and Korean Air put on Won700 at Won29,500. Some securities houses and banking shares rebounded. But primary blue chips remained weak. SHANGHAI's A share index ended 7.8 per cent up on speculative buying after a run of losses in the index since the start of October. The index gained 53.11 at 735.57 on much enlarged turnover of Yn3.0bn, after Yn634.78m on Wednesday. Brokers described the day's gains as a technical rebound supported by speculators, adding that market fundamentals had not changed. SINGAPORE's weak performance was attributed to the volatility of the US currency and the fall on Wall Street. The Straits Times Industrial index shed 11.99 to 2,352.30, with sentiment also dented by sharp falls in Malaysian stocks traded over the counter. MANILA retreated sharply at the close on profit-taking sparked by a steep fall in Philippine Long Distance Telephone and Philippine National Bank. PLDT reported a 13.46 per cent decline in profits in the first nine months, the shares losing 30 pesos at 1,420 pesos, while PNB fell 12.50 pesos to 382.50. Petron slipped 1.50 pesos to 25.50. The composite index dropped by 35.66 to 3,054.99. Losers exceeded gainers by 55 to 26. TAIPEI declined in modest trade on short-term profit-taking after a strong rebound on Wednesday, and on political uncertainties ahead of the December elections. The weighted index ended 36.37 off at 6,306.29 in modest turnover of TDollars 44.55bn. Export-oriented electronics companies led the falls on the recent appreciation of the Taiwan dollar, with Tecom down TDollars 2 to TDollars 51. Plastics and financials were also weak. But food stocks rose as President Enterprises surged TDollars 2 to TDollars 58.50, and marine issues were also strong, with Yang Ming Marine up 90 cents to TDollars 38.10.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Al. Gavrilescu: "The Invisible War of the </F> Reports Does Not Hide Poverty and Corruption"]    [Text] A year ago, before passing the baton of government,  former Prime Minister Stolojan announced to members of his  cabinet that it was time to put their files in order. The  syntheses and points of view presented by the chief  minister-secretaries of state and chiefs of departments, which  were in the form of short reports, made references to the  programs and specific strategies of economic reconstruction and  to recorded results, as well as to the lack of fulfillment in  the past, that has been allusively attributed to political  confrontation. Of course! The objective of the first Romanian  Government was not -- as has been believed -- the operating of  the national economy, but the organization of parliamentary and  presidential elections; a fact which displaced the interest  centers and favored imbalance and the poor management of the  public patrimony. The effects are known. Analyzed now in 1993,  the summary report of the Stolojan government became interesting  when the current executive saw fit to contradict suspicions with  respect to the so-called stagnant condition by publishing the  Vacariou report. This is interesting from many points of view.  One of them, and we believe it is the most important, would be  the credibility of the executive. Because it is tempting; on the  first reading, the justification [is] that the inherited crisis  represents the result of policies which were not founded on  macroeconmic performance criteria, "amplified also by the errors  of the previous government." As we learn from the Vacaroiu  report, to these [factors], inflation and foreign debt should be  added, impacting directly on the entire system of national  production and social life. In other words, in his short history  as minister of economy and finance, George Danielescu asserts,  in September 1992, exactly the opposite: that the Romanian trade  balance recorded visible improvement; this balance for the first  six months being higher -- by $316 million compared to the same  period in 1991! And yet, for the first time, the balance between  demand and supply on the currency market created the  preconditions for keeping inflation under control and  stimulating foreign investment. Taking a contrary view, the  Vacaroiu report indirectly conducts a polemical discussion with  the former government, revealing that the country's monetary  resources were consumed in 1991 and 1992, and for this reason,  Romania contracted new loans, accumulating a debt of $2.2  billion. Moreover, the service on the foreign debt -- the  interest rate and installment payments -- will be $340 million  by the end of 1993.    Going through Stolojan's balance sheet, we should bear in  mind that the movement of consumer prices registered the lowest  increase for the past 12 months. In other words, the financial  and budgetary policy of the former government, that of  austerity, was still tolerable under the conditions of an  aggressive fiscal environment, as well as in conditions of  credible social production.    In the midst of difficulties with the reform process, Prime  Minister Vacaroiu attacks the poor performance in fulfilling the  conditions stipulated in the agreements, concluded with  international financial insitutions by former prime ministers  Roman and Stolojan. These conditions should have been  instituted, however, during 1991-92. The lack of a line of  credit in 1993, caused by the abandonment of the credit  contracts, should be attributed to the former dignitaries. Valid  or not, it remains clear in the statistics that the 1992 budget  had every chance of assuring the criteria listed in the standby  agreement with the International Monetary Fund: that is to say,  limiting inflation, stabilizing the economy, and consolidating  fiscal measures. The linguistic war is all the more confusing in  that the Stolojan government took pride in its balance sheet, in  exceptional international banking relationships, as well as in  calming the Western reservations concerning the Romanian reform.    Last but not least, in the framework of these two reports,  the indices of the monthly rate of inflation are in sharp  contrast with each other. For example, in the month of June  1992, the wholesale prices and the consumption prices registered  a rate of 10.8 percent, considered by specialists at that time  as a corrective inflation, as a result of the devaluation of the  national currency and the reduction of subsidies for consumer  goods and services.    The Vacaroiu administration admits [its role] in the  devaluation which resulted in the diminished purchasing power of  the national currency. Although it is under control, the  phenomenon has developed in an anarchic manner, and given that  the rate of inflation should not surpass 70-80 percent, the  objective of the socioeconomic reform strategy has remained  dubious!    From all of this theoretical and statistical harassment, the  citizen has no way to evaluate the performance of the governors.</p>

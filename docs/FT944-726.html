			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Fears over HK watchdog Hong Kong's anti-corruption watchdog may have its powers reduced after an inquiry yesterday recommended transferring some to the courts and greater judicial oversight of its operations. The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) has wide powers of inquisition bolstered by laws prohibiting the unauthorised publication of its activities. These powers have given rise to fears that after Hong Kong's transfer to China in 1997 they could be abused by the incoming government. Any changes to the ICAC's powers, however, could strain further the already tense relations between Britain and China. Beijing has said in the past that it will not recognise changes to Hong Kong's law made this close to the colony's reversion to Chinese sovereignty. It has charged that Britain is simply seeking to 'loosen the screws' of control and make it more difficult for the post-1997 administration to govern. But the review committee, headed by Dr Helmut Sohmen, chairman of the World-Wide Shipping group, yesterday said some of the commission's powers should be transferred to the courts. These include powers to obtain certain types of information, powers of search and powers to restrain the disposal of property. In addition, a suspect who has had his travel documents confiscated should be allowed to seek judicial review of the decision. At present his only right of appeal is the commissioner.</p>

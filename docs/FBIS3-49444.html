Ivica  Saric reports for Croatian radio.    [Saric] In addition to the shelling of Vitez, the positions  of the Croat Defense Council [HVO] in the Buhine Kuce region  came under fire at 0900. Heavy machine guns are being used in  the main. The enemy began infantry attacks in the direction of  the Vitez operational zone at 0930 with the intention of  restoring control over the buildings it lost yesterday in Buhine  Kuce. Fierce street fighting and a battle for every house has  resumed. The defense formations are successfully repelling the  attacks by the Muslim army.    In the Vitez operational zone, they have evidence that in  yesterday's shelling of Vitez the Muslim army used a type of  cluster bomb. This refers to mortars which prior to exploding  release dozens of the notorious bomblets which explode on  impact. In addition to this, a number of shells which fell on  Mali Mosunj in the municipality of Vitez were filled with  chemicals. People felt sick and dizzy and there were visible  traces of an inky color in those houses which were hit. [passage  omitted]</p>

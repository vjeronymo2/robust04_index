It has also been reported that Pakistan agreed  with the demand of Afghan military Commanders that both the  leaders should resign to bring peace to their country, says a  government handout.    A spokesman of the Foreign Office has clarified that the  above reports are based on a misperception of the Foreign  Minister's Press conference given Monday [24 Jan] before his  departure for Tehran.

The spokesman added that Pakistan has pursued a policy of  non-interference since the establishment of the Mojahedin  government in April 1992 and feels that the use of force is not  a viable option for resolving the Afghan problem. In the larger  national interest, the Afghan leaders should agree to a casefire  and initiate a political dialogue for a peacefully negotiated  settlement. The spokesman reiterated, the Government of  Pakistan's resolve to strengthen bilateral relations with  Afghanistan on the basis of internationally recognised  principles of sovereignty and non-inteference.</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Philip Morris leads Czech race PHILIP MORRIS, the US tobacco company, is poised to win the race to acquire a strategic stake in the former tobacco monopoly of the Czech republic. Approval from the government would give the US group 30 per cent of Tabak, the tobacco company holding 80 per cent of the Czech republic's market. The sale has attracted the attention of leading international tobacco companies which are seeking to enter the profitable markets of eastern Europe. Tabak's former monopoly situation in the Czech republic should allow Philip Morris to operate practically unhindered by competition. On the national level, it will compete with the smaller Slovak company, CSTP, which last week was partially sold to Reemstma, the German tobacco company. International tobacco companies involved in the race to win Tabak have bitterly complained about the governmental decision not to break Tabak into separate plants and allow for more international competition within the country. They have also claimed that Philip Morris, which already had a licensee agreement and was openly favoured by management, had privileged access to information. Czech officials have denied that the tender, monitored by Nomura Securities, was not properly conducted.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with acting Russian Finance Minister Sergey </F> Dubinin and Deputy Finance Minister Sergey Aleksashenko by A.  Yevgenyev; date and place not given: "If Inflation Can Be Kept  in Check, Major Capital Will Move Toward Us. So Russian  Federation Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin Believes"]    [Text] ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA's guest "this Wednesday" is  acting Russian Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin. For three  months he has headed a department which has found itself by the  will of fate at the epicenter of Russian economic reform. He is  43. He is a doctor of economic sciences. While paying tribute  to his competence experts noted on his appointment that, unlike  the uncompromising Fedorov, he is a softer person. We would  add, however, that Dubinin does not yet seem to have provided  any reason to remember that parallel.    Deputy Finance Minister Sergey Aleksashenko also took part  in  our talk.    [Yevgenyev] Sergey Konstantinovich, what is happening with  the 1994 draft budget? It had great difficult and incredible  adventures in passing its first reading in the state Duma.    [Dubinin] We had not expected everything to be sweetness and  light. We had assumed that the debate would be fierce. It is  not a question of some personal failings or shortcomings. It is  all more complicated than that. Any budget reflects a certain  economic policy. It cannot exist outside one. But it was not  hard to predict that the current economic policy would meet with  plenty of opponents in different parties and factions in the  lower house and that they would use the debate on the budget to  overthrow the proposed strategy. In principle this is normal.    [Yevgenyev] How have the regions and ministries assessed the  draft?    [Dubinin] We have done a lot of work with both of them. We  tried out different options and came back again to our initial  positions. In general the budget was drawn up under a new  classification that is as close as possible to international  standards. IMF recommendations have been taken into account.  We included a great many things that were not previously in the  budget -- for instance, the cost of shipping goods to the Far  North. In our view, the budget is realistic. This is why  sectors have mainly been dissatisfied about what they received  -- they had all asked for more. But it is quite difficult to  fundamentally change the budget structure within existing  resources. And going beyond those limits would mean going in  for fantasies.    [Yevgenyev] The Finance Ministry is being rebuked for  overstating the revenue side of the budget.    [Dubinin] Until we have actually collected the cash, the  arguments about the revenue side are merely estimates.  Nonetheless, I do not think that we have gone overboard. We  calculated it as follows: Last year on average we collected 10  percent of Russia's GDP in tax for the budget. This year, if we  keep to the previous structure and collect what we plan to  additionally mobilize for the federal budget, we plan to bring  in 10.6 percent. As you can see, that is a small difference.  Future growth -- up to almost 16 percent -- will be powered by  the proceeds of the 3-percent increase in value-added tax,  better collection of excise duties, and so forth. I think that  by the year's end we will be able to achieve the indicator set  out in the budget. Problems have come from the least-expected  quarter. And, strangely enough, they are connected with the  victory in the fight against inflation. You know, inflation  fell to 10 percent in February and to 8.5 percent in March. It  will be in that ballpark in April as well. This means that  nominal growth in gross product, income, and all the rest will  be slower than envisaged by the budget. Consequently the tax  base will also grow more slowly than planned. But just try to  convince the recipients of budget funds that they will now have  to make do with less than was stated in the budget.    [Yevgenyev] Gaydar and Fedorov stated that the spending in  January-February would lead to a new surge of inflation in  April. But you are claiming that April will be as quiet as  March. How do you explain that?    [Dubinin] By the fact that there was no dramatic expenditure  in January-February. We did not allow it.    [Yevgenyev] What about March?    [Dubinin] Not in March either.    [Yevgenyev] So, what about the debts?    [Dubinin] What debts? The budget debts? We have already  paid off those debts which the government has recognized by  concluding contracts at different times -- and they come to more  than 4.5 trillion rubles [R]. We are planning to repay another  R1 trillion with treasury bills. But there have been a lot of  wrongheaded interpretations, mutual misunderstandings, and  confusion in this area. For instance, people are saying that we  are not giving the Army its extra pay. When the decision was  made in December to index the pay of workers in the  budget-funded sphere, the Finance Ministry warned that the money  for these payments was not there. We were not listened to.  Consequently, when the time came to pay up, we told the Army  leaders that we would not be increasing their salaries.  Naturally people disagreed with this, and they believe that  they are regularly failing to receive their extra pay -- that in  February they received their pay for January, that in March they  received their pay for February, and so forth. In other words,  we have created problems for ourselves, with our own hands. If  we are unable to pay, we should not take on commitments. That  is why we insisted that the minimum wage and bands in the  unified pay scale not be indexed in the second quarter. There  are no funds for this in the budget.    [Yevgenyev] But the countryside has gotten enough for its  soup and porridge.    [Dubinin] This is the way things have gone with the  countryside. We had just one commitment to them -- for grain.  It was not immediately released onto the free market, as would  have been logical, given the good harvest; instead it was  decided to sell it at high fixed prices, indexing those prices  into the bargain. And only to deregulate prices as of 1  October. The Finance Ministry again lodged a protest, since  elementary calculations showed that we would simply be unable to  finance such expensive grain. As a result, we had to spend an  extra R1.5 trillion. It can be said that the entire loan  received from the IMF last year was spent on grain purchases.  Then what happened? "Roskhlebprodukt" received this money as a  budget subsidy. They mobilized the grain, delivered it, and are  storing it in silos, having partially paid for it, partially  pledged to take care of it, and partially accepted, as it were,  state funds without repaying them. By their reckoning, the R1.5  trillion already allocated is no longer sufficient. Then we  told them -- "release the grain, release it. It will be used  for flour, the flour will be used for bread, and the profits  will make their way back to you. And you can pay off your  creditors." For some reason they are unable to resolve this  issue. The money that the population has paid for the grain is  not being repaid by the grain-owners. And if the grain is  released, it will be at the price at which it was procured. And  they will again demand budget funds for new purchases in the  spring -- that is, funds from taxpayers like you and me. What  does this mean in the context of inflation? It means that they  are eating up the circulating capital that was issued to them --  in other words, they are not acting in a market-driven fashion  at all. And the Finance Ministry should provide compensation  for all this.    The following things happened next. "Roskhleboprodukt"  recast the terms of the contract for grain accepted for  responsible storage, declaring it to have been bought. And we  are being presented with the bill: There is still some grain  that has not been paid for. That is how we are living -- eating  up circulating capital and forgetting what a free market is.  Mired in endless debts that we cannot hope to repay. And  nobody is particularly worried about it. They say that the  Finance Ministry will fund it. You even find some strange  things happening. The Commission for Urgent Questions is  examining the sowing situation. Who do you think the report  writer will be? The Finance Ministry. The Ministry of  Agriculture and Food has probably solved all its problems; only  the Finance Ministry is failing to pull its weight.    [Yevgenyev] So do you still owe "Roskhleboprodukt" anything?    [Dubinin] Yes, we have agreed to allocate it another R200  billion from the budget. This is over and above the aforesaid  R1.5 trillion. But "Roskhleboprodukt" will receive the funds in  the form of bonds which it can sell as securities. The bonds  will come into circulation this spring, and they can be sold on  the market to raise R200 billion. And that, clearly, will  settle the issue of the 1993 underpayment. That weight will be  lifted from our backs. But the problem will remain. Because it  is not clear how we can continue to work under such a system.    [Yevgenyev] No matter what we do, we seem to come off badly.  There is not enough money for anything. At the same time,  $15-20 billion is finding its way into Western banks each year.  Doesn't that worry you? Or have you gotten used to it?    [Dubinin] It does worry me. But what are you proposing?  There is a system of licensing the export of foreign exchange  resources and their placement abroad. We have the Federal  Service for Currency and Export Controls, which is designed to  monitor these processes and hunt down criminals. Virtually  everything possible in the way of administrative bans has been  done. But until it becomes more profitable to import than to  export capital, we will not be able to reverse these currency  flows.    [Yevgenyev] But surely it is beneficial to keep foreign  currency in Russian deposit accounts? Nobody anywhere in the  world will give you 36 percent annual interest the way we will.    [Dubinin] Well, suppose for a minute that you are a  businessman. You have earned $1 million. What are you going to  do with it here? Putting it in the bank at 36 percent is boring  and not without risk either. It is impossible to acquire any  real property. Our well-known "Lukoil" company is buying a  network of retail stores in Turkey. Why not in Russia? We have  no network. We just have one store, and then another, and  another.... And it is tiresome to have to buy up trade outlets  one by one. When every Russian has the opportunity to open a  store in Russia, when they can acquire everything they need,  that is when capital will work here as well, rather than just in  Germany and Switzerland. Apart from its well-known advantages,  voucher privatization also has some disadvantages. Virtually  the biggest of these is that you cannot acquire anything for  your money. Practically every bank in Moscow is housed in  rented premises. They cannot even buy their own offices. Where  else can you find a situation like that? [Dubinin ends]    S. Aleksashenko entered the conversation:    [Aleksashenko] I agree, we are experiencing major outflows  of capital. But, strangely enough, since the middle of last  year there has also been an inflow of capital -- but in a  concealed, cash form which is hard to register. When money  passes through bank accounts everything is clear, but when  dollars in cash are brought into Russia by the suitcase, it is  hard to keep track of them. Nonetheless, according to Central  Bank estimates, such capital imports amounted to $5-7 billion  last year.    [Yevgenyev] Is this a reaction to that 36 percent?    [From this point on the identity of the respondent is  unclear]    [Interviewee] The way I see it is this -- the hottest,  riskiest capital has already come here. It is important that it  does not expand the realm of the criminal, black economy, but  that it should work in an entirely civilized and open manner.  Post-voucher privatization will provide the conditions for this  to be possible. And if inflation is kept in check, major  investment will soon be heading Russia's way.    [Yevgenyev] But what is happening? There has been a squeeze  on inflation, and production is literally on its last legs.  Can't you see the connection?    [Interviewee] There is a connection, of course. Any country  bearing down on high inflation is forced to pay the price in the  form of a recession. We are into our second attempt in the  space of less than two and a half years of reform to really get  inflation down. We tried first in mid-1992. And we are trying  again now. Each time falling inflation is accompanied by  recession. Even if we start providing incentives for  production, this will not mean that production will invariably  take off again. We could see the same scenario as in the fall  of 1992, when production stabilized for three or four months at  its previous low level. Or things could be even worse --  production could continue falling quietly and, by supporting  industry, we would find ourselves stoking inflation yet again.  And that would be no joke. Calculations have been done -- they  show that in order to halt the production slump we would need to  pump money into the system to such an extent that inflation  would rise to 50 percent a month. At any point our weary  population might say that it had had enough of prices rising  every day and demand that we lower them. We would again start  bearing down on inflation. And we would again pay for it with  recession. If we go up and down this switchback for another  couple of years, will there be anything left of production at  all? The classic recipe for economic stabilization is to  squeeze inflation out of the system once and quickly. And to  suffer just one recession.    [Yevgenyev] Is something of the sort possible in this  country?    [Interviewee] Theoretically, yes. We could conquer  inflation in the space of a single quarter. For instance, we  could get it down to 3 percent a month. There are some quite  well-known instances of that around. To begin with, we should  not borrow money from the Central Bank. But many enterprises  would then be unable to adapt to a reality that would be new to  them. A large slice of the economy would simply be destroyed.  That is why we are forced to move gradually to 10-, 8-, and  then 7-percent inflation. In order to give industry time to  reorient itself and do something. But I would note that many  directors are hoping for something else. They are traipsing  around the Finance Ministry, the Council of Ministers, and the  Kremlin asking for handouts. I can say quite categorically that  their enterprises are doomed. They will not last long. One such  famous director recently told me that he had twice been  reprimanded by the Politburo for not boosting production of  combine harvesters. They had wanted to remove him for his slow  pace of construction. Today he has everything he needs --  workers, components, and materials. But he cannot sell the  harvesters. He wanted R200 billion to somehow survive until  such time as they can be sold once again.    [Yevgenyev] Well, that was "Rosselmash."    [Interviewee] This is the kind of logic they have. "You do  your experiments there and carry out your reforms. And let me  quietly sit out all this commotion." Of course, we could  mothball a plant in that way and hold out until the historic  time when the economy comes good. But if our entire industry  has to wait for everything to change of its own accord, without  changing anything itself, then we will all find ourselves in the  kind of dead-end that the AZLK [Moscow Leninist Komsomol  Automobile Plant] and ZIL [Likhachev Automobile Plant] plants  are currently in.    [Yevgenyev] Flotation has done them no good. They were  floated, but now they are saying: "Pay us."    [Interviewee] And if you total up what the ZIL Plant is  asking for it comes to R1 trillion.    Quite often of late I have received administration heads  from  quite wealthy oblasts asking for help of any kind. Their oil  refineries have ground to a halt -- the products are so  expensive that nobody is buying them. We advise them to lower  their prices -- for both gasoline and other petroleum products.  My visitors' eyes would come out on stalks -- "How can that be  done when everything is getting more expensive?" But we are in  the marketplace.    The thinking is as follows -- since there is a market, let  prices go through the roof. What is happening with grain, for  instance? Our peasants' wages are 1 percent of world wages, our  fuel is 30 percent of the world price, our equipment is 20-50  percent of the world price, but we produce grain at the world  price. And sausages and milk too. Food prices in any store are  at world levels. And if you make allowances for our very  mediocre quality, then we are actually paying more.  Nonetheless, demand constraints are starting to kick in. Two  oil extraction companies -- "Lukoil" and "Yukos" -- recently  announced that they had frozen their prices for the whole  quarter.    [Yevgenyev] Do you not think that these enterprises need to  be encouraged in some way?    [Interviewee] Such as? Presenting them with a red banner or  scroll of honor? They have provided their own incentive --  their output is being bought and paid for. Incidentally, prior  to this our oilmen had given us no peace for six months in their  demands for subsidies. Throughout this period a package of 18  documents, each worth between R300 billion and R1 trillion, was  circulating among government members. People tried to wheedle  official stamps out of them. Thank God, they stood firm. That  is why the Finance Ministry did not give out the money, and why  the demand constraints have started working. Now we will see  what happens next. I think that our oil industry will live  normally if it learns the rules of the market.    [Yevgenyev] But there are natural monopolies -- railroads,  electricity, gas. What about them?    [Interviewee] In those areas we cannot do without a system  of state regulation. From my standpoint, nobody exploits their  monopoly position as shamelessly as the power generation people  at the "YEES Rossii" [Russian Integrated Power Grid] Russian  Joint-Stock Company. When they charge one rate in one oblast  and another rate bigger by an order of magnitude in another  oblast, what do you call that? That sort of thing does not  happen in any country anywhere. And they will not accept the  cheapest power from nuclear stations onto their grid for fear of  spoiling their indicators.    [Yevgenyev] Nuclear power workers recently picketed the  White House. Was that related to the behavior of the Integrated  Power Grid?    [Interviewee] Undoubtedly. This situation was largely  brought about artificially. In this connection I would like to  say the following. Yes, our miners have been in a difficult  position, and that is now true of the military. But trillions  of rubles pass through their hands. They have the funds to give  themselves room for maneuver. Why is it that people will  seemingly forget about one place somewhere? Wages will not have  been paid there for five months, people will have been pushed to  the limit, to the point of starvation. I suspect that these  sources of extreme tension are created with a purpose. Then  everyone suddenly seems to remember about them. The press and  television suddenly descend and show us the starving. The  "background to the disease" begins to be teased out. And this  is used to get money for the entire sector.    You will note that these situations are reproduced  systematically. It seems to me that we are dealing with a kind  of blackmail, to which both the government and society are  subjected. And all of us have to pay. For instance, to fend off  the miners' discontent, we gave them R2 trillion that had been  earmarked for increasing wage bands in the second quarter. This  means that we are robbing Peter to pay Paul.    [Yevgenyev] We need to close mines that have no future.    [Interviewee] Yes, we do. Although that costs money too.  Nonetheless, last year the coal industry was planning to find  R40 billion and close just one mine -- at Khalmer-Yu. It did  not find the money and did not close the pit. It has been given  R2 trillion this year, yet there is still no money to spare for  the closure. The pit is located inside the Arctic Circle, where  mining anything is senseless, and the coal quality is as bad as  it gets. I fear that the rumor that 10 pits will close in the  first half of the year will remain a rumor. Miners already know  from experience that they can overspend, present the government  with an ultimatum, and get what they want. Even at somebody  else's expense.    [Yevgenyev] But few people know about this. Why are facts  of this sort not made public? Why is information not regularly  published on pay, the number of working days in the year, and on  the leave for workers in different sectors?    [Interviewee] We need to do that in depth. And, clearly,  not only on an intersectoral basis. For instance, take a major  enterprise maintained by injections of state funds and look at  its spending structure -- how much the director earns, how much  the engineers and workers earn, whether the soccer team is  funded, whether dividends are paid on the shares, and what kind  of social costs there are. This detailed analysis should be  carried out at a micro-level so as to provide a clear and  accurate picture.    You are probably right. This would be instructive to many  people. I promise to think about it.</p>

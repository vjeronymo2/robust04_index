			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROSE CASE SITE DEBATED;  </P> <P> NO REASON TO SWITCH, HIS LAWYERS ARGUE  </P> <P> Seeking the home court advantage, attorneys for Cincinnati Reds Manager Pete  Rose asked a federal judge in Columbus, Ohio, Monday to return Rose's suit  against baseball Commissioner Bart Giamatti to a state court because  allegations of local bias were not grounds for a move to the federal system.  </P> <P> In a brief filed in the U.S. District Court of Judge John Holschuh, the  attorneys argued that baseball's "irrelevant ramblings about some supposed  federal interest" did not provide a basis for moving the case to federal court  and accused baseball of making "thinly veiled attacks on Ohio's state courts."  </P> <P> There was no indication when Holschuh will rule as to whether the state or  federal system has jurisdiction over Rose's attempt to seek a preliminary  injunction preventing Giamatti from conducting a hearing that could result in  Rose's suspension from baseball if it is determined he bet on the Reds, as  alleged by baseball's special investigator, John Dowd, in his report to  Giamatti.  </P> <P> That hearing was originally scheduled June 26, but on June 25 Rose received a  temporary restraining order against Giamatti from Judge Norbert A. Nadel of the  Hamilton County Common Pleas Court in Cincinnati. Nadel supported Rose's  contention that Giamatti has prejudged the case against Rose.  </P> <P> Nadel was scheduled to hear Rose's bid for a preliminary injunction July 6, but  on July 3 the U.S. District Court in Cincinnati, responding to a motion by  Giamatti's attorneys to move the case to federal court, assigned the motion to  Holschuh's court in Columbus and wrote that because of Rose's national  reputation and identification with the Reds and Cincinnati, it appeared  advisable to transfer the request to another city.  </P> <P> Rose, in turn, filed a motion with Holschuh asking that the case be returned to  the state court, prompting Holschuh to set a July 12 deadline for receiving  baseball's arguments on the subject and July 17 for receiving Rose's. At the  same time, he extended Rose's protection against suspension and firing, as  enacted by Nadel, until he makes a decision.  </P> <P> Giamatti, according to his staff, wants the case in federal court for two basic  reasons.  </P> <P>  -- The federal courts have always upheld the commissioner's authority.  </P> <P>  -- A state judge in Rose's hometown of Cincinnati, facing reelection as Nadel  is, could be influenced to make a parochial decision. Federal judges are  appointed.  </P> <P> "If ever it were appropriate to remove a case to the federal court to avoid  such local pressures, this is the case," attorneys for Giamatti wrote in a  110-page brief filed with Holschuh last Wednesday.  </P> <P> They also wrote that the federal court has jurisdiction on the grounds of  diversity of citizenship, Rose being a resident of Ohio and Giamatti of New  York. However, Rose's suit also names the Reds.  </P> <P> "Under governing law, all doubts must be resolved in remanding this case to  state court," Rose's attorneys said in the brief filed Monday.  </P> <P> It is possible, according to legal experts, that Holschuh will schedule a  hearing with the two sides before making a decision.  </P> <P> The losing side is expected to appeal, further delaying a process that began in  late March with the announcement that Rose was being investigated for alleged  gambling activity.  </P> <P> "I think people are sick of this. I know I am," Red owner Marge Schott told the  Associated Press Monday.  </P> <P> Schott was recently hospitalized for tests relating to an undisclosed ailment  that stemmed, she said, from job-related stress. In addition to the allegations  and legal problems surrounding Rose, the Reds have been decimated by injuries  and lost 23 of their last 33 games.  </P> <P> "These are tough times," she said. "It's been a very difficult thing for me,  you know."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Ron Peters, identified by federal authorities and investigator Dowd  as the bookmaker who handled Rose's bets, entered a federal prison camp in  Terre Haute, Ind., Monday to begin a two-year sentence on federal charges of  cocaine distribution and making false statements on his 1985 income tax. Peters  could have received a 23-year sentence, but federal authorities requested a  reduced term because Peters had cooperated with a federal grand jury  investigation of Rose's taxes.  </P> <P> "Seeing your face in the paper every day and on the news -- I'm sure it's going  to be awhile before my face gets in the paper again -- just to get away from  all that for a while will be nice," Peters said as he prepared to enter the  prison camp.  </P></p>

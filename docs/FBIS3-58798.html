			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos made  a statement in Strasbourg expressing his satisfaction over the  European Parliament's acceptance of the Greek presidency  proposals. Many European Union [EU] member countries supported  the accession of Cyprus and Malta to the EU. Nikolaos Belos,  Greek Radio special correspondent at the European Parliament  headquarters, has the following report:    [Begin Belos recording] All the political groups in the  European Parliament are in favor of the membership of Cyprus and  Malta in the EU. This conclusion has been drawn from today's  deliberations at the European Parliament plenary session, which  were held after EU Council President Theodhoros Pangalos and  Commission member Hans van den Broek presented reports on  relations between the EU and these two countries.    At the same time, it has been learned that the name of the  EU  observer at the intercommunal negotiations on the Cyprus issue  within the UN framework will be announced in the next few days.  As Mr. Pangalos noted, the observer will brief the EU on  whether negotiations within the UN framework are in accordance  with EU norms [kektimeno] and EU-Cypriot relations. Analyzing  the presidency's intentions concerning the application of Cyprus  for membership, Mr. Pangalos stressed that he has scheduled a  meeting on the EU's association with Cyprus for May and added  that the Greek presidency, responding to the decisions made at  the Lisbon summit, will also hold a political dialogue with the  Cyprus Government at all levels.    Mr. Hans van den Broek pointed out that talks between EU  officials and Cypriot authorities on preparations for membership  are developing at a very satisfactory pace. In conclusion, Mr.  Hans van den Broek described 1994 as an important year for the  membership requests from Cyprus and Malta and stressed that the  final decisions will be made in January 1995 on the basis of the  progress made by that date. It is worth noting that all the  political group representatives without exception, Greeks and  others, who took the floor supported Cyprus' membership in the  EU.    Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos gave an  international news conference late this afternoon and responded  to questions from correspondents on the Greek presidency's  program. On EU expansion, Mr. Pangalos, who will visit the  three Scandinavian candidate countries soon, stressed that there  are difficulties in the negotiations but expressed the hope that  they will conclude by 28 February as scheduled. He added that  the presidency has provided for two unscheduled meetings of the  EU foreign ministers in February.    Responding to a question on the Skopje issue, Mr. Pangalos  said that Greece supports and guarantees the existence of  Skopje. This state, he said, exists thanks to Greece, since its  economic life depends on Thessaloniki. For this reason, Mr.  Pangalos added, Greece would like this state to change its  behavior on the issues of borders, its constitution, and the  emblems on its flag.    Mr. Pangalos also responded to questions on the  implementation of the white paper and on other issues that the  Greek presidency will be handling. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESIGNATION OVER SENTENCING LAW  </P> <P> The tough new sentencing guidelines aren't dehumanizing; exactly the opposite,  they hold some promise that criminals pay dearly with hard time behind bars,  providing a small measure of hope the rest of us might live a more human (read:  secure) existence.  </P> <P> I believe there are many like myself who hope President Bush will replace Judge  Irving with a fair-minded, energetic judge who will have no problem with tough  sentencing, with luck, one who will also have "fun" doing so.  </P> <P> JEFF GHOLSON  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

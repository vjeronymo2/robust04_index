			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: World Bank decides on 5-year global The World Bank has opted for a five-year maturity on its long-awaited Dollars 1.5bn offering of global fixed-rate bonds which it expects to launch early this week. The five-year maturity best reflects current investor interest, the Bank said. Some syndicate managers had been expecting the Bank to tap the 10-year area of the dollar sector. 'Five years is not the World Bank's preferred choice but is rather a reflection of where investors told us they wanted to put their money to work,' said Mr Peter Horvath, senior finance officer at the World Bank in Washington. The launch will go ahead despite Friday's sharp fall in US Treasury prices. Volatile market conditions early last week had caused the Bank to delay the launch. Mr Horvath added: 'We think the prospects for the offering are good, but we are in a bear market and not a bull market.' 'The five-year area is where it will receive the best reception,' said an official at Lehman Brothers, which is lead-managing the deal with UBS. 'The market is in a fairly defensive mood at the moment and portfolio managers are erring on the side of caution and looking for (bonds of) a more neutral duration,' the Lehman Brothers official said.</p>

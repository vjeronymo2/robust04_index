An uncontrolled or illegal release or threatened release of one or more hazardous substances ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Note: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The substances that are actually released or threatened to be released include all hazardous substances  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> except <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  petroleum products), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The quantity of the hazardous substances which are released, or are threatened to be released, need (or would need) to be removed, cleaned up, or neutralized according to Federal, State, or local law; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. There is only a threatened release of hazardous substances, but this threat leads to an action (e.g., an evacuation) that can potentially impact the health of employees, responders, or the general public. This action makes the event eligible for inclusion into the surveillance system, even though the hazardous substances are not released.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A hazardous substance includes, but is not limited to, any element, substance, compound, or mixture, including disease-causing agents, which after release into the environment and upon exposure, ingestion, inhalation, or assimilation into any organism, either directly from the environment or indirectly by ingestion through the food chain, will or may reasonably be anticipated to cause death, disease, behavioral abnormalities, cancer, genetic mutation, physiological malfunctions (including malfunctions in reproduction) or physical deformations, in such organisms or their offspring; except that the term ``hazardous substance'' does not include petroleum products, including crude oil or any fraction thereof which is not otherwise specifically listed or designated as a ``hazardous substance.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To achieve the purpose of this program, the recipient shall be responsible for conducting activities under A., below, and ATSDR will be responsible for conducting activities under B., below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Recipient Activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Develop a mechanism that ensures that the State health department is notified of hazardous substances emergency events in a timely fashion. This should include negotiating formal or informal agreements with all State agencies that are normally notified when hazardous substances emergencies have occurred. These State agencies should include, but not be limited to, State police, fire departments, environmental agencies, and various offices of emergency government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Investigate the emergency event by gathering and entering the information obtained from all sources into the HSEES tracking system. Sources may include, but not be limited to, those agencies mentioned in A.1., and other relevant Federal, State, local, and private agencies in keeping with the surveillance protocol.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Establish and maintain appropriate procedures to ensure the timely gathering and entering the information into a database as prescribed by the HSEES protocol.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. ATSDR Activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Assist recipients in acquiring appropriate information for performance of HSEES and evaluating the completeness and quality of relevant information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Provide prototype information gathering instrument.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Assist recipients in establishing and maintaining appropriate and timely schedules for the HSEES surveillance process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Assist recipients in selecting training that will be useful in maintaining the surveillance system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Analyze environmental and/or biological results for specific situations in which ATSDR has concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Evaluate the overall performance of recipient's adherence to the surveillance protocol.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Evaluation Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applications will be reviewed and evaluated according to the following criteria:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A.

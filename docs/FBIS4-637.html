			<p>BFN     [Text] Heavy fighting is continuing in Tubmanburg, Bomi  County, between Madingo and Krahn elements within ULIMO [United  Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia]. Alhaji Koromah  and Roosevelt Johnson recently issued a joint communique in the  Sierra Leonean capital, Freetown, to stop the bloody conflict  within the organization. People say the battle for Tubmanburg  has escalated to other areas in Bomi County. A convoy of relief  supplies for thousands of citizens in Cape Mount, Bomi, and  Lower Lofa Counties was stopped at the Po River by ECOMOG  [Economic Community of West African States Cease-fire Monitoring  Group] soldiers.    Roosevelt Johnson's faction of ULIMO has vowed to revenge  the  death of their people killed by the Koromah faction. People say  ECOMOG soldiers in the Tubmanburg area are being disarmed by the  Krahn elements of ULIMO.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   Now Time for Tackling Reconstruction -- Johannesburg THE  STAR  in English on 11 May in a page-14 editorial says the  inauguration ceremony of President Nelson Mandela and the  accompanying festivities shows firstly, "the widespread and  genuine interest which the international community takes in the  reborn South Africa, and its anxiety to make it work."  Secondly, it shows how "South Africans can put ancient  differences aside to express a common joy and a common loyalty  to the country." Thirdly, it shows that "even if South Africa's  record in organising first-time all-race elections is a bit  spotty, we can hold our own with anyone when it comes to staging  a really five-star wing-ding." The editorial also says it hopes  President Mandela, and everyone, "understands that this has to  be the last of an unnatural run of non-working days. After this  it's sleeves up and on with the tasks that lie ahead. Ours is a  country that needs a lot of construction and reconstruction."    Liberation Movement Lets Down Coloreds in Western Cape -- In  an article on page 14, Frank Meintjies, who is a director of the  community-based Development Program, and a former media  spokesman of the Congress of South African Trade Unions, writes  that "it is surprising that so many people are taken aback at  the election outcome in the Western Cape where the predominantly  colored electorate voted the National Party [NP] into regional  power." Meintjies contends that it was not the NP that won  colored support, but "perhaps it is the coloureds who can claim  to have been let down by the parties in the `liberation  movement' camp. The ANC for example: -- Failed to adequately  answer concerns of coloured voters as to how affirmative action  will apply. --Until recently, imposed a more Africanist  political strategy in the Western Cape at the expense of the  more pluralistic style of the UDF [United Democratic Front]. --  Hailed De Klerk a man of integrity even before he had apologised  for excesses of apartheid." The liberation parties also  "insisted on the 'so-called' prefix when using the word  coloured. This was intended to undermine the classifications of  apartheid; instead it fed coloureds' negative self-image." "In  the end, the Western Cape coloured community -- without much  else to go on -- turned to De Klerk, the sinner turned 'man of  integrity'. Faced with uncertain times, they sought a home with  the party they saw as culturally closer in terms of language and  religion and understanding of their marginal position." As for  the future of the colored people, Meintjies believes that in the  short term colored people "will have to stand back in favour of  the advancement of African people."  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   Opportunity To Generate Economic Growth -- Johannesburg  BUSINESS DAY in English on 11 May in its page-16 editorial notes  that economically, South Africa "has everything going for it --  and the presence of leaders from 160 countries illustrates this.  And yet, confidence in our new-found national purpose remains  fragile. The slide in out gold and foreign reserves need not be  a worry if we remain on our present track, but it underscores  the uncertainty of investors and businessmen whose decisions  will determine whether South Africa's economy takes off or  falters." BUSINESS DAY points out that aid packages and  improved trade relations "will not solve our economic problems  alone. Our own efforts will be far more important. We should  not forget that aid and trade concessions are generally granted  because they serve a donor nation's self-interest, not because  of any innate generosity. While, for example, South Africa's  precipitately negotiated access to the United States'  Generalised System of Preferences is to be welcomed, we have not  won terms any more favourable than those extended to most other  developing countries. The new duty exemptions on 4,000-odd  items announced last week should make a big difference to  producers of those goods. But it does little more than bring us  into line with most non-OECD [Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development] countries, and leaves us less  favoured, in terms of access to the U.S. market, than countries  of South and Central America and Israel. Nevertheless, an  opportunity has opened -- the opportunity to generate strong  economic growth without fear of the foreign exchange constraints  that nipped previous expansions in the bud."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   Call To Limit Availability of Guns -- "We hope the new  Government will live up to its promise to limit the availability  of guns in South Africa," declares a page-8 editorial in  Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 11 May. The paper calls for a  curb on the "illegal inflow of guns from neighbouring states and  the large number of weapons in the hands of rightwingers. For  instance, efforts must be undertaken by the new National Defence  Force to retrieve weapons issued to commando units."</p>

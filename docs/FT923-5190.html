			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Persimmon falls 42% to Pounds 7.25m SHARE PRICES of UK housebuilders were sent tumbling again yesterday after Persimmon, regarded as one of the best companies in the sector, announced a 42 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30. More than Pounds 23m was knocked off Persimmon's stock market value as the share price fell 25p to 148p. Mr Duncan Davidson, chairman, described the UK housing market as the worst in his 30 years in the business. Interim profits fell from Pounds 12.5m to Pounds 7.25m despite increased sales of Pounds 71.5m (Pounds 68.5m). Mr Davidson said that lower house prices, increased selling costs and the high price paid for land at the end of the 1980s had pushed net margins down from 18.2 per cent to 10.1 per cent. Part-exchange deals and special offers, such as free carpets and white goods, cost the group Pounds 3,500 for each home sold. This was equivalent to a 5 per cent reduction in profit margins on an average priced home of Pounds 63,000. If discounts were included, the figure would have been even higher. 'In other words sales incentives could reduce pre-tax profits by about Pounds 8m this year on sales of about 2,400 homes, slightly more than the 2,300 sold last year,' said Mr Davidson. The group sold 1,128 homes in the first half compared with 1,100 last time. Average selling prices, after taking account of discounts, were 8 per cent lower. The slight increase in sales meant that Persimmon was increasing its share of a reduced market for new house sales, making it the seventh largest housebuilder in the country. Last year it was the eighth largest. Earnings per share fell to 5.2p (10.1p). The interim dividend is maintained at 2.8p and a same-again final of 5.8p is forecast, 'unless market conditions deteriorate further.' Mr Davidson warned that less resilient builders were expected to cut or omit dividends when they announce interim results during the next few weeks. 'Our results, given the state of the market, were not too bad,' he said. The balance sheet remained strong with net debt of Pounds 32m, equivalent to 24 per cent of shareholders funds of Pounds 132m. This excluded Pounds 11m of off-balance sheet finance reflecting Persimmon's share of housing joint ventures. See Lex Prices for housing land have fallen sharply and in some cases were between a quarter and third of their peak in the late 1980s, Mr Duncan Davidson, said yesterday. Prices in parts of the Midlands had fallen from between Pounds 600,000 and Pounds 700,000 an acre to just Pounds 200,000.  Owners which had been holding land in the hope that house prices would rise were beginning to sell sites at more realistic values, he said.  Persimmon had increased its land bank to 13,300 plots with planning permission, representing about 5 years' supply at current selling rates. The group said that bank was higher priced land bought in the late 1980s.</p>

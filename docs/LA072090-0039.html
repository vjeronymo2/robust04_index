			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAQI LEADER SHAKES OPEC WITH THREATS AGAINST OVERPRODUCERS;  </P> <P> PERSIAN GULF: KUWAIT AND UNITED ARAB EMIRATES APPEAR TO BE TARGETED IN  INTENSIFIED OIL DISPUTE.  </P> <P> Iraq's bellicose Saddam Hussein, bolstered Thursday by a parliamentary proposal  that he be elected president for life, has shaken his Persian Gulf neighbors  with threats and accusations just before a price-setting meeting of the  Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.  </P> <P> Chedli Klibi, secretary general of the Tunis-based Arab League, flew to Kuwait  for talks with officials of the oil-rich sheikdom, which was accused by Iraqi  officials of stealing oil, territorial aggression and driving down petroleum  prices in a campaign "inspired by America to undermine Arab interests and  security."  </P> <P> Kuwait countered Thursday with a letter to the Arab League denying the Iraqi  accusations and declaring, in turn, that "Iraq has a rich record in its  violations of Kuwaiti territory."  </P> <P> Relations between Iraq and the Persian Gulf oil states of Kuwait and the United  Arab Emirates have been strained for months as over-quota production by the two  smaller states has glutted world oil markets, driving down the per-barrel price  that Iraq and other exporters get for their petroleum.  </P> <P> A recent pledge by Kuwait and the Emirates to stay within their OPEC-assigned  quotas apparently did not satisfy Hussein, whose oil minister is expected to  push for a higher target price at next Wednesday's OPEC meeting in Geneva.  </P> <P> The bombastic Iraqi leader, speaking Tuesday in Baghdad before a political  gathering marking the 11th anniversary of his ascension to power, threatened  unnamed overproducers with violence if they do not rein in their exports.  </P> <P> Calling on God to witness "we have warned them," Hussein said, "If words fail  to protect Iraqis, something effective must be done to return things to their  natural course. . . ." At one point he told his responsive audience, "Iraqis  will not forget the saying that cutting necks is better than cutting means of  living."  </P> <P> Coming from the man who last spring threatened to "burn half of Israel" with  chemical weapons if attacked by Israeli "mass-destruction" weapons, Tuesday's  warning was closely examined by Middle East analysts and government leaders.  </P> <P> Some key gulf newspapers, including Kuwait's Al Qabas and the Saudi Arabian  daily Ash Sharq al Awsat, downplayed or ignored Hussein's remarks, but the  Kuwaiti government showed its concern by dispatching diplomats to key Arab  capitals to seek support for its case.  </P> <P> Saudi Arabia's King Fahd and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak reportedly  telephoned Kuwaiti and Iraqi officials to try to defuse the confrontation.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Baghdad newspapers reported Thursday that the Iraqi Parliament voted  Wednesday to make the presidency, to be filled in a proposed election this  year, a for-life job. Hussein, who vowed that the election would demonstrate  democratic values in Iraq, has said he would be a candidate. No one else has  stepped forward in a country where political challenges to the president have  resulted in mysterious deaths or disappearances.  </P> <P> Hussein's remarks this week were backed by a long letter of complaint, written  by Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz and delivered to the Arab League, about  the oil practices of Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.  </P> <P> As reported by the official Iraqi news agency, the Aziz letter accused Kuwait  of occupying Iraqi territory, an action it charged was tantamount to "military  aggression"; of stealing Iraqi oil by tapping into the Rumaila field from the  Kuwaiti side of the border, and of driving down oil prices by overproduction,  which Aziz charged, has cost Iraq $89 billion in lost revenue over the last  nine years.  </P> <P> The Iraqi outburst brought a quick pledge of support from Washington for its  small Persian Gulf allies. A State Department spokesman told reporters,  "Clearly, we're strongly committed to supporting the individual and collective  self-defense of our friends in the gulf."  </P> <P> Kuwait and Iraq have a longstanding border dispute, and Baghdad clearly covets  some Kuwaiti islands at the top of the gulf. As a major oil producer with  reserves reputedly second only to Saudi Arabia's, Iraq has always been troubled  by its short gulf coastline -- less than 40 miles -- from which to ship its  exports.  </P> <P> Some analysts suggested that Baghdad's bitter accusations were designed  primarily to prepare the ground for the OPEC meeting in Geneva, to round up  support among other producers to hold Kuwait and the Emirates to their quotas  and to drive up the price of oil by raising fears of instability in the gulf.  </P> <P> But with a well-trained, well-equipped army of 1 million, Iraq has turned  itself after its long war with Iran into the powerhouse of the Persian Gulf --  and when Hussein threatens violence, his remarks are not dismissed as bluster.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEXT STEP  </P> <P> The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is to meet next Wednesday in  Geneva. The oil ministers are expected to fix an official, combined production  ceiling and possibly a new reference price for the remainder of 1990. The  reference price is the average for all the different grades of crude oil pumped  by the 13 member states. OPEC has predicted its base reference price will "soar  above and beyond" its current $18 a barrel after the conference. But market  analysts say the conference could be contentious.  </P></p>

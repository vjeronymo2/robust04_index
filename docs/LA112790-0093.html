			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> SATISFIED: Attorneys for Arlo Smith, loser in the race for attorney general who  is challenging the state's absentee ballot procedures, wanted a deposition from  Secretary of State March Fong Eu (above) by the time they appear in a Santa Ana  court Friday. . . . But Eu balked and filed a declaration that she has "no  personal knowledge" of instructions or guidelines that her staff may have given  county registrars.  </P> <P> Fine, says one of Smith's lawyers. "That's all I needed. The secretary of state  doesn't know what's going on . . . to defraud the voters." Tony Marcano and Jim  Newton  </P></p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / International Company News: Randgold in West African initiatives Randgold, the troubled South African gold mining company, has signed a mining convention with the government of Senegal and begun exploration in Burkina Faso ahead of the planned listing of its west African mineral rights next year. Mr Peter Flack, Randgold executive chairman, said the accords and listing represent the company's faith in the strong portfolio of mineral rights it has acquired in the region over the past two years. 'There is a unique window of opportunity in west Africa at the moment which Randgold is exceptionally well positioned to utilise,' he said. 'After many centuries of neglect, gold mining there is now on the brink of a renaissance.' The most developed of Rangold's west African operations is in Burkina Faso, where it recently secured a further 1,000 sq km to complement its 2,500 sq km joint venture with Newmont. It also has prospecting and mineral rights in Senegal, Ivory Coast and Gabon.</p>

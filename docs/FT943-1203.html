			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (15): Customer is in the driving seat - Case study The second-hand car salesman as characterised in street mythology is a man not to be trusted. 'The retail trade is not held in high esteem,' says John Bacon, an executive director of Camden Motors. Research has made Bacon painfully aware of how the public views the process of buying a car. He is determined to change things in his industry, with the help of a multimedia project part-funded by the European software development programme Esprit. Bacon's research established that until the actual hand-over of a new car 'the buyers are often unsure that they're getting what they want.' There are, in his opinion, too many variables for the average car-buying customer, who feels that the sales person is in charge of the process. The customer's ignorance of the many different variables - discounts, value of part-exchange, catalogue data and so on  - puts them at a disadvantage. 'Add to those variables the process of trading used cars, finance and loans, and it becomes bewildering for the buyer,' he says. He argues that the sales role has concentrated on dealing skills  - the much-caricatured hard-sell patter  - and not enough on really helping the customer through the maze of choices. The multimedia system is designed to put the customer in the driving seat, both metaphorically and literally. It is already working in a test environment at Camden Motors' headquarters in Leighton Buzzard. The system uses information from a variety of sources, presented in text and video. By picking a route through a maze of options on such issues as finance (probably the most daunting topic for the average buyer), users can arm themselves with very specific information. This typically includes valuation of the present car for trade-in, options for finance, and new models in which they are interested, which users can ascertain before coming face-to-face with anyone on the sales floor. Improving the process of buying a car is a critical issue for Camden Motors, which buys and sells countless vehicles every year for large commercial clients. Established in 1932, Camden Motors ranks as the fifth-largest supplier of new cars and the third-largest seller of used cars in the UK in 1994. Corporate clients include its parent, Barclays Bank, and Alamo Rent A Car, to whom it is supplying 65,000 cars up to the end of December 2000. Barclays' own heavy involvement with multimedia gave Bacon the chance to improve upon a touch-screen pre-sales 'car shopping' system which had already proved successful. In 1991, Camden Motors won funding of Pounds 3m from Esprit, in a consortium including Barclays and multimedia developer Olivetti. From the 174 applications for funding, the Camden Motors project became one of the 17 endorsed applications: it has matched the investment with Pounds 312,000 of its own, spent on setting up the IT infrastructure, including a 486-based computer and ISDN network, and extensive staff training. 'People have asked me if this is IT looking for a function. In fact there's a real need,' says Bacon. 'The challenge of multimedia is to address the business problems of motor retail. I'm no techie, I wouldn't be interested if it wasn't a solid commercial problem being solved.'</p>

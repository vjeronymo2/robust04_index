			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Army affairs correspondent Roni Daniyel] </F>   [Text] Sami Abu-Samahdanah, a leading Fatah official in  the Gaza Strip, was arrested and later released for blocking the  Netzarim junction because -- so he claimed -- shots were fired  at him from the settlement of Netzarim. His takeover of the  junction was recorded on film, Israel lodged a complaint, and  Abu-Samahdanah was arrested by the Palestinian police. However,  there is a follow-up to this story. Our Army affairs  correspondent Roni Daniyel reports:    [Begin Daniyel recording] Sami Abu-Samahdanah, a leading  Fatah official in the Gaza Strip, wanted to make a show of  muscle. He summoned television crews to the Netzarim junction  to show everybody that he could take over the junction. The  embarrassment was mutual, both for the Israelis and the  Palestinian policemen. Abu-Samahdanah and his followers pulled  out guns, said they were there to stay, and that they would not  allow Jews to cross.    Nine of his followers were arrested yesterday, and last  night  Abu-Samahdanah himself was summoned to the Khan Yunus police  station. It would seem, however, that the friendly attitude of  the Palestinian policemen during the dispersal of the  demonstration continued there as well. Abu-Samahdanah was  released. Moreover, he was recruited to Muhammad Dahlan's  security apparatus, his followers were stationed in a training  camp, and the Abu-Sittah brothers -- who were arrested on  suspicion of having murdered the late Uri Magidish -- will serve  in the unarmed police. A Gaza-style solution. [end recording]</p>

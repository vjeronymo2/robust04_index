The slanging match between the two administrations in  Vladivostok has not yet died down, and now here is another one  -- between Nizhniy Novgorod Governor Boris Nemtsov and city  administration head Dmitriy Bednyakov. To try to extinguish the  smoldering flame before it takes hold was the aim of a one-day  visit to the Volga city by Petr Filippov, chief of the  Presidential Administration Administration for Information  Support.    "I have come to study the situation on the ground on the eve  of the elections," he told ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA's correspondent.  "You see, the Presidential Administration is concerned that in  a number of oblasts and regions elections have been  unsuccessful. Nor are we unaware of the preelection conflict  between Nizhniy Novgorod Governor Boris Nemtsov and Mayor  Dmitriy Bednyakov..."    In order to get to the bottom of the situation, Petr  Filippov  visited the city administration, talked with the governor, met  local entrepreneurs, exchanged opinions with citizens, and spoke  with journalists. I inquired as to his impressions. They are  on the whole positive. Concerning the elections for the oblast  legislative assembly, the city duma, and the mayor of Nizhniy  Novgorod due on 27 March Petr Filippov expressed himself  optimistically. In his opinion they will be successful, and he  foresees a fairly high percentage turnout.    [Orlov] "Why?"    [Filippov] "Conflicts always attract attention and intrigue  people...."    What is the essence of the preelection clashes in Nizhniy  Novgorod? Initially they centered around the privatization of  the motor car plant. ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI has written about this  several times. Then the adoption of the Nizhniy Novgorod  charter became the bone of contention. Dmitriy Bednyakov, the  current acting mayor, decreed that a referendum should be held  27 March on the local self-government charter. But Governor  Boris Nemtsov, relying on the law and an interpretation from the  Russian Federation president's state-legal administration,  deemed the city mayor's actions a contravention of legislation  and revoked his referendum decree. Bednyakov, in turn, does not  agree with Nemtsov's conclusions. And so on and so forth.    P. Filippov did not give his assessment at the press  conference of the preelection squabbles in the upper echelons of  power in Nizhniy Novgorod. This circumspection can only be  welcomed. The situation will be reported to the president  personally, he said. At the same time the visitor from Moscow  expressed regret over the marked split in the ranks of local  reformers.</p>

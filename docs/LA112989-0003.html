			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DENG RETIRES  </P> <P> One of the things I have to be thankful for is that the politicians here in the  United States do not follow the example of former Chinese leader, Deng  Xiaoping, and retire because they "might say crazy things" (Part A, Nov. 21).  </P> <P> We would have no government left if our leaders retired just because they might  say crazy things. And what would David Letterman, Jay Leno and Johnny Carson do  for material without leaders saying crazy things!  </P> <P> I would not want to live in a world without Dan Quayle, George Bush, Richard  Nixon, Gerald Ford and Gary Hart.  </P> <P> I'm only 42 and I already say crazy things. I'm glad I don't live in China!  </P> <P> LINDA COWAN MOSE  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: FAO official gloomy on price outlook for tea WORLD TEA prices are likely to soften over the next seven years because of a projected surplus in output of black tea by the turn of the century, a senior official of the United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organisation said yesterday, Reuter reports from Coonoor, India. Mr Gunther Wurdack, secretary of the Intergovernmental Group on Tea in the FAO, said that despite the projected weakening in already depressed prices, it was unlikely that this would translate into a significant increase in consumption. He told a commodities conference here that global production of black tea was forecast at 2,638m kg in the year 2000, compared with projected demand of 2,548m kg. 'The projected imbalance of supply outstripping demand would indicate that already depressed prices could weaken further,' he said. 'This in turn could force a number of growers to curtail production since already current prices obtained by some teas do not cover costs.' In a paper read at the centenary conference of the United Planters' Association of Southern India, Mr Wurdack said this would not be in the interests of the tea industry. He suggested it might induce both exporters and importers to reconsider the idea of raising the quality of teas entering the export market by implementing minimum quality standards. Quality improvement would help bolster international prices by reducing supply, he said. The FAO is to hold an intergovernmental group meeting in Morocco next June to discuss setting new international standards for the tea industry, Mr Wurdack told conference delegates. 'Going for better quality teas is the right approach to take,' said Mr AK Gosawmi, joint secretary in charge of plantations in India's commerce ministry. 'There is not much elasticity in developed markets.' The FAO forecasts that India, the world's largest producer of black teas, will boost tea output to 966m kg, compared with a government target of 1bn kg by the year 2000. It expects the next largest producers, Sri Lanka and Kenya, to have outputs that year of 264m kg and 250m respectively. Mr Wurdack suggested, however, that the Sri Lanka figure might prove to be be too low. UPASI forecasts that Indian production will reach a record 745m kg this year, compared with 703m kg in 1992 and 743m kg in 1991. World black tea import requirements are forecast by the FAO to reach 1,227m kg in 2000, up from 963m in 1990. Mr Wurdack said total export availability by the turn of the century would be 1,325m kg, leaving a projected exportable surplus of 98m kg. Several delegates at the conference objected to the FAO's predictions, arguing that they were based on faulty data and would help add to the depressed international prices. UPASI forecast that prices might rise this year. Having averaged Rs39 (82p) a kilogram at Indian auctions during the past four years, they could reach an average of Rs48 in 1993, it said.</p>

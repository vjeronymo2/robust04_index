			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / NatWest poised to shed up to 4,000 jobs, say unions National Westminster Bank is today expected to become the second high street bank this week to announce large-scale job cuts. The announcement, after the 3,000 job losses over two years announced by Barclays Bank on Monday, will take some of the shine off the monthly unemployment figures due out today. National Westminster refused to comment on its job reduction plans and said any announcement would be made to staff first. Unions believe the cuts will be larger than those at Barclays and may be as high as the 4,000 that NatWest announced in February 1993. The bank did, however, say it was committed to avoiding compulsory redundancies if possible. The official jobless total dropped 36,100 to 2,815,900 in November, the eighth monthly fall last year, leading to government optimism for an economic revival in 1994. Falling jobless totals, however, have not reflected the shake-out in the finance industry, which, according to the Banking, Insurance and Finance Union, has led to the loss of 100,000 jobs in the past four years. The union said 3,000 banking and building society branches had closed last year - 2,000 of them bank branches. It said: 'We feel it is completely the wrong way for the industry to go because it is alienating the customers. 'Staff are being pushed into accepting performance-related pay rises, often geared to the sale of products such as insurance policies and pensions, and leading to customer mistrust.' The Barclays announcement took total job losses in its five-year programme to 21,000 up to 1996. It believes there is still scope for voluntary redundancies, but unions fear that the banks may be running out of other avenues for job reductions. National Westminster still has 2,500 branches, more than any of its high street rivals, but it has been cutting staff in the past three years.</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Voters seek effective third party AS MANY as 53 per cent of voters would be likely to support the Liberal Democrats if they thought the party could win a majority, according to today's Daily Telegraph/ Gallup poll. The figure falls to 44 per cent if the party were likely to hold the balance of power. Only 20.5 per cent of respondents said they would vote Lib Dem if there was an election tomorrow. The survey also gives further evidence of Labour's improved ratings for economic competence: 38 per cent said they felt the party could best handle Britain's economic difficulties, against 44 per cent for the Conservatives and 31 per cent before the campaign. Meanwhile, the latest ICM poll for The Guardian, published yesterday, points to a fall-off in Conservative support among women, the paper says today. The survey, which gave Labour a four-point lead overall, put the party three points ahead among female voters. This reversed the position in a poll published on March 17 which suggested that women favoured the Tories by a margin of three points.</p>

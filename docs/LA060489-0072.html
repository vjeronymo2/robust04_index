			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 1ST TENANT CHARGED UNDER W. HOLLYWOOD RENT CONTROL LAW  </P> <P> In the first criminal prosecution of a tenant under West Hollywood's tough rent  control law, a man accused of lying to the Rent Stabilization Commission in an  attempt to win a $25 rent reduction faces up to 12 years in prison and fines of  up to $30,000.  </P> <P> Douglas Gelvin, 33, who now lives in Los Angeles, is accused of preparing false  documentary evidence, offering false documentary evidence and committing  perjury under oath before the rent commission in 1987, when he lived in West  Hollywood.  </P> <P> Each of the felony charges carries a maximum four years in prison and a $10,000  fine.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pleads Not Guilty  </P> <P> Gelvin, who was released on $1,500 bail after his arrest last month, pleaded  not guilty to the charges last Wednesday in Beverly Hills Municipal Court. A  preliminary hearing has been set for June 22.  </P> <P> Gelvin's lawyer, Charles R. English, called the charges brought by the district  attorney's office, at the request of West Hollywood rent control officials, "a  bit of overkill," and he accused city officials of trying to make an example of  his client.  </P> <P> "It's obviously the kind of prosecution that permits them to say they're being  evenhanded," English said. "But given the potential penalties involved compared  to what the accusations are, this case is a little bizarre."  </P> <P> Until now, criminal prosecutions under the 4-year-old law have been aimed  solely at landlords.  </P> <P> Asked if Gelvin was singled out, the city's chief rent control officer said the  case was "not unusual, other than the fact it is the first of its kind against  a tenant."  </P> <P> "The message here, if there is one, is that if you come to our (rent  commission) hearings, you need to testify truthfully, regardless of whether  you're a property manager, owner or tenant," said Richard Dorsey Muller, the  city's rent stabilization director.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sought $25 Reduction  </P> <P> The charges against Gelvin stem from a 1987 hearing before the rent commission  at which he sought a $25 reduction of his $548-a-month rent, accusing his  landlord of eliminating one of two parking spaces to which he was entitled.  </P> <P> The landlord, Ashkenazy Management Co., contended that Gelvin's rent for the  studio apartment at 949 Larrabee St., where he lived from March, 1983, until  July, 1987, included use of only one parking space.  </P> <P> After Gelvin presented several canceled checks with notations indicating that  the rent payments were also for "extra parking," a hearing examiner reduced his  rent by $10 a month.  </P> <P> However, Gelvin appealed the decision, insisting he was entitled to the $25  decrease.  </P> <P> During the appeal, a lawyer for the management company presented bank  photocopies of the checks Gelvin had offered at the earlier hearing which did  not contain the notations. The lawyer, Steven Weaver, claimed Gelvin entered  the notations after the checks were cashed to make it appear he was paying for  the extra parking space. The commission agreed and ruled in favor of the  company.  </P> <P> Gelvin declined to be interviewed, but English said his client "is obviously  torn up by the potential consequences of something like this. . . . He's no  criminal. He's more like the guy next door."  </P> <P> Although the Gelvin case is the first criminal case against a tenant, at least  two dozen West Hollywood landlords or their agents have been prosecuted since  the law was enacted in 1985, all but one of them on misdemeanor charges.  </P> <P> Last year, a property manager was charged with two felonies after being accused  of falsifying documents presented to the rent commission to obtain a rent  increase for an apartment he managed.  </P> <P> After pleading guilty to charges of perjury and offering a forged or altered  document as genuine, E. (Budd) Kops, 69, was placed on probation for three  years, ordered to pay the city $6,500 in costs and a fine of $3,500, and was  placed under house arrest for 60 days.  </P> <P> Most of the prosecutions have occurred since last year, when West Hollywood --  where an estimated 85% of residents are renters -- hired a full-time  enforcement officer as part of a new "get-tough" policy against rent control  violators.  </P> <P> Muller said the city has recovered more than $150,000 in unpaid registration  fees, overcharged rents, fines and attorney's fees as a result of the  prosecutions. The city has collected an additional $100,000 in fees from  landlords who have come forward voluntarily as a result of the stepped up  enforcement, he said.  </P> <P> He said the Gelvin case, "just happens to be the first instance where an  investigation has resulted in a prosecutable offense of this magnitude  involving a tenant."  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Hugh Bobys said the case against Gelvin is "unusual in that,  as a matter of dollars and cents, the amount of loss to the landlord may not  seem of great significance, and yet the potential penalties are extremely  great.  </P> <P> "I think it tells people that West Hollywood is very serious about prosecuting  people accused of committing perjury or presenting false evidence in its (rent  control) hearings," he said. "In that sense, it's sure to get people's  attention."  </P></p>

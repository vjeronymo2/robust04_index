			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Council tax appeal costs likely to outweigh benefits INDEPENDENT property val-uations for householders who wish to appeal against council tax bandings are likely to cost more than the probable benefits of a successful challenge, it emerged yesterday. The government is budgeting for about a million such appeals, Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, said. Organisations of professional valuers expect a wave of valuation work once people see how their homes have been placed in the eight property bands on which the tax is based. Although an independent valuation will not be obligatory for an appeal to be made, professional valuers say that since the disputed figures will by then be two years old, it will be difficult for a private individual to make a sensible assessment. The structure of the tax, which limits the range of bills set by any council, means that in the short-term for many people it will not be worth incurring the costs of an appeal. Estimates of costs ranged from about Pounds 50 for an initial check, to around Pounds 150 for a more detailed assessment. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said that in the few cases which would require representation at a formal valuation tribunal hearing, the bill could be 'several hundreds of pounds'. The individual bandings have just become available to local authorities. The prospect of independent valuations was raised by Mr Howard, who said people were 'perfectly entitled' to get a valuation done on which to base an appeal. The government had budgeted for about a million appeals, he said on BBC radio. No appeal can be made until April, and most councils said there was no immediate stampede from people anxious to find out their banding. The Tory-controlled Association of District Councils pointed out that, taking transitional relief into account, the advantage of moving from one band into the one immediately below would be only 25p a week for the first year. An analysis by the Labour-controlled Association of London Authorities showed significant amounts at stake in the higher property bands in the capital. It estimated, for example, that a property in the top band in Greenwich would pay Pounds 1,322 next year, while one in the band below would pay Pounds 218 less. During question time at the Commons, Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, predicted that the 'chaos and injustice of the poll tax is likely to be surpassed by the chaos and injustice of the council tax'.</p>

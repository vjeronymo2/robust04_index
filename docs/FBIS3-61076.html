It has been learned from reliable sources that he is still  free but has been removed from his duties. Yuriy Konovalenko is  suspected of having committed a series of crimes while in  office, the most serious among them being the embezzlement and  resale of especially valuable equipment and nonferrous metals.  If these charges are confirmed by the official investigation  now under way, the case of the former chief of the Semipalatinsk  test site will more than likely be taken over by Russian law  enforcement organs, since Konovalenko is a Russian citizen.</p>

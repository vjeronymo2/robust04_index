			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> COACH'S CURFEW TO REIN IN BRONCOS  </P> <P> Denver Broncos Coach Dan Reeves has imposed a first-ever 1 a.m. curfew on his  team, saying he is "irritated as heck" about his players' recent run-ins with  the law.  </P> <P> He said Thursday that any Broncos player seen in public after 1 a.m. faces  disciplinary action, and any player ticketed for an alcohol- or drug-related  offense will be suspended without pay for at least one game.  </P> <P> Last week, two Broncos players had run-ins with Denver-area police. Starting  tackle Gerald Perry, who was acquitted of a rape charge this summer, consented  to undergo counseling after police found him with a prostitute at Perry's  parked car on a Denver street. Later in the week, starting tight end Clarence  Kay was cited by Edgewater police for driving while impaired after he was  pulled over for speeding. Kay, a two-time offender of the NFL's substance-abuse  policy, faces a possible suspension from the league.  </P></p>

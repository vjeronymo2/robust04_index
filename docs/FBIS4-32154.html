			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, June 20 (BTA) -- The Union of Democratic  Forces (SDS) and the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), this  country's major parliamentary forces, still differ radically  about the way to go to possible early parliamentary elections,  according to socialist leader Zhan Videnov, who spoke to the  press after his meeting with SDS leader Filip Dimitrov. The  decisions of the two forces' top-level forums about early  elections this year were discussed at the meeting.    The BSP holds that the question about elections should be  raised in late summer or early in the autumn, when the  government's term, for which it received a confidence vote, will  run out, and it will have carried out its programme. For its  part, the SDS believes the issue should be resolved without  delay in the coming days and weeks, for which purpose a cabinet  crisis should be precipitated, followed by the fall of the  cabinet and elections in October. According to the SDS, the  Electoral Law and the constitution should be amended only after  the fall of the cabinet. "We set forth our position, namely,  that it is difficult to discuss other matters before the  government's fate is decided," Filip Dimitrov said. The BSP is  eager to have early elections but not just now, he added. The  Socialists' suggestion that the preparations for early elections  should start in the autumn practically amounts to putting them  off, Dimitrov said.    These two approaches are hard to combine. Moreover, the SDS  links a number of necessary steps, such as amendments to the  Constitution, debates on a new electoral law or amending the  effective one, with a guarantee for early elections, which they  see exclusively in the fall of the government, Videnov  explained. In his view, this is an extreme, unwise and  unrealistic approach, to which reality will provide a  corrective. Videnov believes that given the great difference in  the views of the two major parliamentary groups, it is doubtful  whether there will be fast guaranteed progress in a direction  that would be of benefit to the country above all.    The socialist leader presented to Filip Dimitrov an expert  analysis of the minimum of work needed to be done on the  Electoral Law. The analysis shows that it could not be done in  a few days, Zhan Videnov said.    Videnov told the press the meeting had been held by mutual  agreement and had been under preparation for the last three or  four months. Filip Dimitrov said the invitation to the meeting  had come from the BSP leadership and the SDS had accepted it.  It was attended by Ivan Kurtev, chief secretary of the SDS  National Coordinating Council, and Krasimir Premyanov, Deputy  Chairman of the BSP Supreme Council.</p>

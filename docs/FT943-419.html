			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Gatt successor hits delay in Congress The creation of a new World Trade Organisation was put in jeopardy yesterday after US legislative approval ran into serious difficulties. The World Trade Organisation, a cornerstone of the deal reached last December at the end of the seven-year Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, was to have come into existence in January 1995. Enactment of the deal is delayed in the European Union and Japan. Yesterday, its ratification was threatened by the decision of the chairman of a powerful US Senate committee to hold it up till the end of the present Congressional session. The US administration, weakened by partisan attacks on the president, has made trade a centrepiece of its foreign policy. Defeat of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade deal could be more serious in the long run than the loss of President Clinton's healthcare legislation. Senator Ernest Hollings, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, which has partial jurisdiction over the legislation, said there is 'no chance at all' that the Senate will vote on the bill before it adjourns on October 7 for congressional elections. The World Trade Organisation, agreed as part of the Uruguay Round and due to supercede the GATT in January 1995, will be threatened by US delay. The other main trading countries, including Japan and European Union members, have also still to approve the Uruguay Round deal. Delay has worried other governments and US exporters, the most politically significant supporters of the trade agreement. Opponents have fanned the flames of protectionism and isolationism. Gatt legislation next year may face a more Republican and more protectionist Congress. Lawyers say it may be difficult to re-introduce the legislation under the special fast-track rules, which prohibit amendment. Mr Clinton has met Senator Hollings, protectionist and longtime defender of US textile producers, to urge his co-operation. The senator said yesterday that he is planning 'a series of hearings' which will keep the bill stifled in his committee. Under Senate rules, he can hold the bill up for 45 days.</p>

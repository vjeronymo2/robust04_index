			<p>BFN     [Text] Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito  obtained eight and six ministerial seats respectively in the  Hata cabinet formed on 28 April. The two parties hold almost  three-quarters of the posts in the new cabinet. The "Ichi-Ichi  line" between Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and  Komeito Secretary General Ichikawa took the lead in managing the  political situation during the Hosokawa administration. However,  following the secession of the Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ] and Sakigake [Harbinger] from the coalition  administration, Shinseito and Komeito will play a leadership  role in the Hata administration as well. Giving consideration  to possible criticism regarding zoku Dietmen [influential Diet  members concerned with specific issues], in the past such posts  as transportation and construction minister, whose tasks are  linked to the interests of private companies, have mainly been  given to the SDPJ. However, these posts as well as the minister  of posts and telecommunications have been given mostly to  Komeito because Shinseito hesitated to accept them.    Of the seven posts that had been given to the SDPJ and  Sakigake during the Hosokawa administration, three went to  Shinseito, two to Komeito, and one to the Democratic Socialist  Party [DSP]. The remaining post, plus one other, which had  previously been given to the Japan New Party [JNP], went to the  "former reform group" and the Liberal Party, which joined the  coalition after last August. Since it did not have suitable  candidates, when the Hosokawa cabinet was formed the JNP gave  three ministerial posts which had originally been allocated to  the same party to ordinary citizens who were not politicians,  and two posts to the United Social Democratic Party. Although  the number of ministerial posts the JNP had was reduced to two,  Yoshio Terasawa became the party's first minister.    Since the Hata administration, which is a minority  government, is expected to face difficulties in managing state  affairs, and since some Shinseito members, mainly young members,  feel uneasy about the future, Shinseito will give priority to  "strengthening the party structure." The party decided to allow  the retention of their party posts to Kozo Watanabe, acting  secretary general who assists Ichiro Ozawa; Hajime Funada,  standing board member; and Keisuke Nakanishi, standing board  member who is in charge of elections and organization.    Regarding the selection of a chief cabinet secretary, which  was a focal point of the recent cabinet lineup, Shinseito  studied the possibility of appointing to the post Takashi  Yonezawa, secretary general of the DSP, in order to strengthen  cooperative ties. However, Prime Minister Hata wanted to choose  a person who could act as liaison between Hata and Ozawa.  Therefore, an agreement was reached to give the post to Hiroshi  Kumagai, former international trade and industry minister and a  close associate of Ozawa. Kumagai is the one who began forming  the new group called "Kaishin." However, some senior Shinseito  members who are critical of the hasty formation of "Kaishin" are  coolly assessing the selection of Kumagai, saying: "It is a  selection designed to make the organizer of `Kaishin' assume  responsibility for the blunder until the end." Regarding a  proposal to appoint Mutsuki Kato to the post of finance  minister, Shinseito members strongly opposed it, saying that "he  joined the party only six months ago." Instead he became  agriculture, forestry, and fisheries minister.    Keeping an eye on the second reorganization of the political  world, Komeito brought back to the party former Posts and  Telecommunications Minister Takenori Kanzaki, who is a candidate  to be the next Komeito secretary general. Wakako Hironaka,  former director general of the Environment Agency, was initially  scheduled to remain in her post. However, since Minister of  Construction Koji Morimoto and Mikio Oomi, director general of  the Science and Technology Agency, were elected from the Kinki  bloc, Komeito gave consideration to the need to maintain a  regional balance. Because of this, Toshiko Hamayotsu, a member  of both the Komeito executive committee and the House of  Representatives who was elected from the Tokyo electoral  district, was chosen among Komeito female lawmakers to be  director general of the Environment Agency.    Hata wanted to appoint a member of the group which recently  joined the coalition to a ministerial post, hoping it will  encourage LDP members to secede from their party. Accordingly  Koji Kakizawa, who once was parliamentary vice minister of  foreign affairs, was appointed to the post of foreign minister  whose visit to the Middle East is drawing near.</p>

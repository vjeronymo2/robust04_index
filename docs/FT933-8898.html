			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / French reserves hit by currency crisis THE Bank of France has been left with a substantial net deficit in its foreign currency reserves as a result of its attempts to bolster the franc in the recent European currency crisis. German foreign currency reserves, meanwhile, have shown a sharp increase. In Paris, figures issued yesterday by the Bank of France showed that the country's net reserves fell by almost FFr190bn (Pounds 21.64bn) in the week to August 5, leaving the central bank with a deficit of more than FFr180bn in its foreign exchange holdings. The drain on French reserves will have been due almost entirely to the central bank's intervention in the currency markets to try to keep the franc above its former ERM floor against the D-Mark. On July 29 alone, economists estimate the central bank spent more than the FFr160bn used to defend the franc in its previous crises in January this year and September 1992. The total amount of reserves used by the French authorities in the recent crisis is estimated at more than FFr305bn. The reserves data helped to explain France's cautious approach to reducing interest rates since the widening of fluctuation bands within the currency system on August 2. Economists said that if the French authorities were to lower interest rates, the currency could fall against the D-Mark - but the central bank would have no reserves with which to support the exchange rate through currency intervention. In Frankfurt, figures issued yesterday showed Germany's foreign exchange reserves rose by DM39.3bn (Pounds 15.5bn) in the last week of July as a result of the currency turbulence preceding the decision to widen currency bands in the ERM and thus avert speculative pressures. The Bundesbank said in its weekly statement that the reserve total was now DM157.9bn. The sharp rise, caused by Bundesbank intervention to support currencies under pressure - predominantly the franc - only showed up in the figures for the week to August 7 because foreign exchange transactions are reported with a week's delay. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, has said some DM60bn flowed into Germany in July as a result of intervention in the ERM. The franc slipped against the D-Mark yesterday after the central bank figures were issued. It closed yesterday at FFr3.514 against the D-Mark, about a third of a centime down on the day. But at one stage, the currency was being bought at FFr3.52. The Danish krone also fell sharply against the D-Mark amid signs that Denmark needed to replenish its foreign exchange reserves after the crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism.

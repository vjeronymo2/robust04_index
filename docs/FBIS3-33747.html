			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Nouakchott ORTM Radio in Arabic at 2030  GMT on 30 January carried a detailed dispatch by its reporter at  the Ministry of Interior, Posts and Telecommunications on the  results of the first ballot of the local elections. The report  said that 197 municipalities out of a total of 208 had been  decided in the first ballot. The remaining 11 municipalities  will be decided in a second ballot on 4 February. 540,284  people, 70.05 percent of those eligible to vote, voted in the  election. The following are the results as given in the  dispatch:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Number of municipalities contested:   |208                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Number of seats contested:            |3244                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Number of lists of nominees:          |347                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      The following final results of the first ballot were given:    Number of municipalities decided in the first ballot: 197    The ruling Republican Democratic and Social Party won 163  municipalities. The Union of Democratic Forces "'Ahd Jadid" won  16 municipalities. Independents won 18 municipalities.    There is some discrepancy between the total number of  muncipalities won by the two parties given at the end of the  report and the breakdown of the number of municipalities won in  each province. In the breakdown the number of municipalities  won by the ruling Republican Democratic and Social Party adds up  to 164, the number of municipalities won by the Union of  Democratic Forces adds up to 17 and the number of municipalities  won by independents adds up to 18. That brings the number of  municipalities decided in the first ballot to 199.</p>

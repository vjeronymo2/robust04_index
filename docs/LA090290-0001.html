			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES OF THE WEEK  </P> <P> Falling in Love (Channel 13 Sunday at 6 p.m.) is a handsome if conventional  1984 variation of "Brief Encounter" starring Robert DeNiro and Meryl Streep as  suburban Manhattanites married to others who become involved in spite of  themselves.  </P> <P> Who Gets the Friends? (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.) is a painfully misfired 1988 TV  movie comedy about a divorcing couple (Jill Clayburgh, James Farentino).  </P> <P> The outrageously entertaining -- in all possible meanings of the phrase -- Mad  Max Beyond Thunderdome (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.) takes us far, far past the  Apocalypse and into a chaotic arena where combatants battle tooth and claw. Mel  Gibson again plays the heroic loner; Tina Turner is the dynamic villainess.  </P> <P> The 1987 TV movie Love Among Thieves (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is an old-fashioned  adventure starring Audrey Hepburn as a wealthy concert pianist caught up in a  perils-of-Pauline journey, during which she encounters a mysterious Robert  Wagner.  </P> <P> Nicolas Roeg's 1985 Insignificance (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.) is a  pretentious, talky concoction which brings together four unnamed but easily  identifiable '50s icons -- Marilyn Monroe (Theresa Russell), Joe DiMaggio (Gary  Busey), Albert Einstein (Michael Emil) and Joseph McCarthy (Tony Curtis) -- on  a sweltering night in Manhattan.  </P> <P> Gena Rowlands' Emmy-winning portrayal in the title role of The Betty Ford Story  (ABC Monday at 9 p.m.) is the best reason by far for catching this 1987 TV  movie. Josef Sommer and Nan Woods co-star.  </P> <P> Don't let your daughter grow up to be a drug-addicted porn star. That's about  the only point of the 1988 TV movie Shattered Innocence (CBS Tuesday at 9  p.m.), an example of how TV can strip a sensational true story of its  complexities and power.  </P> <P> Cross My Heart (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m., again on Saturday at 8 p.m.) is  a well-intended 1987 romantic comedy that doesn't quite jell; Martin Short and  Annette O'Toole play a pair of star-crossed daters.  </P> <P> A 1988 satire of Los Angeles, consumer culture and modern dating, You Can't  Hurry Love (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m., again on Saturday at 5 p.m.), tries  to have it both ways, simultaneously damning contemporary hedonism and  wallowing in it.  </P> <P> The 1980 tale of infidelity A Change of Seasons (Channel 5 Thursday at 8 p.m.)  exploits rather than satirizes contemporary sexual mores. Among the victims:  Shirley Mac-Laine, Bo Derek and Anthony Hopkins.  </P> <P> The unintentionally campy Tarzan, the Ape Man (Channel 5 Friday at 8 p.m.), in  which Miles O'Keeffe and Bo Derek vie for best chest honors amid hilarious  dialogue and predicaments, also boasts a gloriously hammy turn by Richard  Harris as Bo's father.  </P> <P> Night Walk (CBS Friday at 9 p.m.) is a trite 1989 TV movie in which police  lieutenant Robert Urich falls for the gorgeous witness (Lesley-Anne Down) he is  protecting.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Speaking in an interview with newsmen at Government  House this morning, Defense Minister General Wichit Sukmak said  the Defense and Foreign Ministries are working together in  compiling data on Cambodian intrusions, spillover fighting, and  casualties suffered by Thai people living along the Cambodian  border. Asked whether the military would hand over directly to  the United Nations the evidence collected by Thailand, Gen.  Wichit said the armed forces would let the Foreign Ministry do  that by taking into consideration the impact on Thai-Cambodian  relations.    [Begin recording] [Wichit] The Foreign Ministry will decide  which information can be used and whether the political  situation is appropriate for us to make a protest -- whether the  good relations would be affected. The Foreign Ministry will  decide about that, but we are ready to provide it with facts.    [Unidentified reporter] To improve the situation, do you  think the supreme commander should make a visit there?    [Wichit] We must try to preserve and promote relations  between our two countries since we are neighbors. That's what  we should do. Especially the military, we must try promote good  relations. There is fighting in Cambodia, and we must work  together in order to prevent spillover into Thailand. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Democrats in retreat THE REPUBLICANS did well in Tuesday's state, city and local elections in the US. They replaced Democratic governors in New Jersey and Virginia, unseated the Democratic mayor of New York, and emerged victorious in several smaller contests. These were not national ballots but the outcome will make it more difficult for President Bill Clinton to get his legislation through Congress. The tide of political opinion is clearly not running his way. It is true that local factors play a larger part in US local elections than they do in their counterparts in many European countries. New York's outgoing mayor, David Dinkins, who lost by a whisker, was not an outstanding success in a job that may be impossible to do well. New Jersey's outgoing Democratic governor, Jim Florio, who also lost by a slim margin, had increased taxation and incurred the wrath of the National Rifle Association. In Virginia the Republican, George Allen, won by a convincing 58 to 41 per cent, but the vote was influenced by support for religious fundamentalism. Party allegiance does, however, count for something, perhaps more than many Americans believe. Democrats are still governors in 29 of the 50 states. They control an overwhelming majority of US city halls, in spite of losing Los Angeles earlier in the year. In off-year elections there is often a swing against the party that controls the White House, as even President Ronald Reagan discovered shortly after taking office. Added to that, the electoral mood this year is against incumbency itself. In Maine and New York City the voters approved limits on the number of terms any one representative could serve. The danger for President Clinton is that while there are more Democrats around there are more who can be turfed out. The big test will come next year, when there will be gubernatorial contests in 36 states, and a third of the senate and the entire lower house will be re-elected. The swing of the pendulum alone suggests that the Democrats are likely to be the loser in these mid-term elections. If Mr Clinton is to rely on what is at best a tenuous party allegiance in Congress he must try to get as many votes through Congress as he can during the coming year. One important vote is due in a fortnight, when the lower house will decide on ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement. There is no doubt that the US economy would benefit from Nafta, but in particular areas there are fears about the exportation of jobs across what would be a barrier-free border with Mexico. Several head-counts suggest that before this week's Republican triumphs support for Nafta in the lower house was short of victory by some 50 votes. Tuesday's results will have made some individual congressmen and women more nervous about their re-election next year. Much work will have to be done by President Clinton between now and November 17 if the passage of the Nafta deal is to be assured.</p>

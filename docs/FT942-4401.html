			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Balsam creditors face big write-offs Bankers to Balsam, the sports-surfaces company plunged into crisis this week after its four-man board was arrested on suspicion of fraud, believe the bulk of their DM1.6bn (Dollars 950m) direct and indirect exposure to the Bielefeld-based company will have to be written off. Although the total is large, only one bank has an exposure of more than DM100m, it emerged at the first meeting of bank creditors in Wiesbaden on Wednesday night. This is BfG Bank, Credit Lyonnais' German subsidiary, which has a total of DM113m at risk to Balsam and to Procedo, the factoring company at the heart of the alleged fraud. According to Frankfurt bankers, three banks have an exposure of DM80m - BHF-Bank, Bayerische Vereinsbank and Landesbank Rheinland Pfalz - while Deutsche Bank, Westdeutsche Landesbank, Norddeutsche Landesbank, Landesbank Hessen-Thuringia and other banks each have around DM60m at risk. Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank are believed to be owed DM50m each. Wednesday's meeting of creditors focused primarily on the fate of Procedo, Germany's largest factoring company. Procedo is Balsam's largest direct creditor and banks' credit exposure to the stricken Balsam is largely indirect, via Procedo. Talks are due to resume on Monday. The state prosecutor in Bielefeld said earlier this week that the four Balsam directors had been arrested on suspicion of forging documentation to support applications for factoring agreements. Factoring companies advance cash to their customers against the security of unpaid invoices, taking a commission for the service provided and assuming responsibility for collecting their customers' outstanding receivables. The state prosecutor said the Balsam directors had over a period of years forged letters from a US accounting firm purporting to verify the scale of large invoices which were subsequently the subject of factoring agreements with Procedo. The invoices were either fictitious or grossly inflated, the Bielefeld prosecutors' office revealed, and the money raised on the invoices was used by the company to speculate in currency and other financial markets. It is not yet clear how much of the money obtained by Balsam from Procedo relates to genuine invoices, pending an investigation by an independent firm of accountants. When discussions resume on Monday talks will focus on a possible plan to rescue Procedo. Bankers said they hoped AKV Allgemeine Kreditversicherung, the Mainz-based insurance company which owns 50 per cent of Procedo, would inject cash to refinance Procedo. The affair has raised questions about German corporate governance similar to those provoked by the near collapse of the Metallgesellschaft industrial group earlier this year and the failure of the Jurgen Schneider property group. Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, Germany's two biggest banks, have traditionally been close to Balsam. The two were indirect shareholders in the company and had planned to bring it to the stock-market in the late 1980s. As in the Schneider and Metallgesellschaft cases, the close involvement of Germany's leading financial institutions failed to prevent the debacle. The role of the auditors to Procedo and Balsam is also likely to come under discussion.</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Owners rebuffs Airtours' final bid OWNERS Abroad yesterday rejected a raised final hostile offer from rival holiday group, Airtours, which values the company at Pounds 268m. Mr Howard Klein, the Owners Abroad chairman who was offered an increased cash alternative by Airtours last week, said the new offer still undervalued his company. 'The board believes the strategic alliance with Thomas Cook and LTU will deliver far greater value to shareholders than Airtours' final offers,' said Mr Klein. Thomas Cook and LTU, the German travel company are both controlled by Westdeutsche Landesbank, the German state bank, which is still hoping to create a pan-European holiday group with Owners Abroad. The immediate reaction of some Owners Abroad shareholders was that Airtours' new offer was not over-generous. One said it was 'touch and go' whether Airtours would win at this level. Airtours' increased all-share offer includes 15 Airtours shares for every 34 ordinary Owners shares. With Airtours shares up 3p at 309p last night, this offer values Owners' shares at 136p, 2p above Owners' closing price. Airtours also increased, and made final, its preference share offer, in which it will give 218 convertible preference shares for every 100 Owners Abroad convertible cumulative redeemable preference shares. The company did not increase its partial cash alternatives. These are Pounds 67.94 and 19.41 Airtours ordinary shares for every 100 Owners Abroad shares, and Pounds 122.08 in cash and 95.92 Airtours convertibles for every 100 Owners Abroad convertible shares. Mr David Crossland said the final offer was fair both to shareholders in Airtours and Owners Abroad, who had never before seen a price that high. He said Airtours bookings continued to gain momentum and its market share continued to be ahead of Owners Abroad's. Airtours is currently the number three in the holiday tour market behind Owners Abroad, both of which are less than half the size of market leader, Thomson. Airtours also forecast a 1993 dividend of not less than 8.7p, a 20 per cent increase. Airtours offer is final, unless a 'competitive situation arises' from another bidder. Lex, Page 18</p>

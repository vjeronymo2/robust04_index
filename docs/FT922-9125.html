			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Comrades in the classroom struggle: The two Tories behind Wandsworth's schools revolution The backstreets of Wandsworth in south-west London are the last place to seek revolutionaries. But in Mr Edward Lister and Mr Donald Naismith, the Tory borough's chairman of education and his chief officer, it has the archetypal subversive duo: passionate in their cause, determined to confound received wisdom, with a blueprint - in both senses - for every ill. Their joint cause is selective education; the cursed creed, comprehensivisation. And the blueprint? Smaller, specialised, state schools selecting their pupils and competing for custom. The plan is raising a storm in the part-deprived, part-gentrified borough, an ill-fitting amalgam of Battersea, Tooting and Putney. Last week came the latest instalment. Mr Naismith presented a paper to Mr Lister's education committee, acknowledging the opposition of head teachers to the interviewing of prospective pupils and the adoption of criteria (besides where they live) for selection, only to conclude: 'The heavy reliance on the concept of equality of opportunity in educational policy should not, perhaps, go unchallenged. It may be argued that too limited an interpretation has traditionally been placed on 'equality' and too narrow a view taken of 'opportunity', and that the reality facing parents and pupils has fallen well short of the ideal the phrase represents.' A page on, in Mr Lister's recommendation, comes the sting. A plan is to be put out to consultation for the introduction of formal selection into the admissions procedure of the three remaining comprehensives under Wandsworth's control. (The borough's eight other state-funded schools - city technology colleges, church and grant-maintained schools - already select or are beyond the council's reach). 'Matching', not 'selection', is the catchword: 'to provide schools which offer different value-oriented education and training to suit the varied needs of pupils . . . schools must be better matched to pupils.' How they are to be so 'matched' is unclear. By ability, parental commitment, or vocation - and if by the first two, what about the failures? 'Choice centres' for parents of such children is Mr Lister's response. The extent of the 'choice' open to their customers is left to the imagination. Whatever you think of the ideas, though, you have to admire the duo's gusto. Rough attacks on community comprehensives, the social democratic vision for achieving true equality of opportunity, may still lack respectability. Yet Mr Lister and Mr Naismith have the courage to preach and proselytise what most of the chattering classes just whisper  - before, more often than not, packing their offspring off to private schools, a world apart from most pupils and parents at the typical inner-city comp. Mr Naismith, 54, a career south London education officer with the prime ministerial ear, is quite open about the end product he envisages. 'We want a mixed economy in education,' he says. 'We have never argued that all schools should be selective, but if the only choice in an area is six neighbourhood comprehensives, the local authority is failing in its duty.' The product of a 'no-nonsense' grammar school in Bradford, Mr Naismith was a 1960s fan of Lord Boyle, the Tory more responsible than any other for the comprehensive experiment: 'Nowadays I am sure he would have seen the national curriculum as the best road to opportunity for all.' Standards are Mr Naismith's refrain, and he has the facts at his fingertips. In 1990, when Wandsworth took over its schools from the Inner London Education Authority, four in 10 of the borough's school-age population were educated outside its education system - half of them in the independent sector, half migrating west, many to leafy Richmond. Now it is below three in 10. Of those 16-year-olds attending the borough's schools, the proportion leaving without any - any - GCSE passes was 19.3 per cent in 1989; now it is 12.6 per cent, against an inner-London average of 17.9 per cent and a national average of 7.8 per cent. Comparisons with neighbouring Lambeth are stark. 'We have a lot of catching up to do,' he adds, 'but on such figures we should be judged - and rightly so.' Mr Lister, 42, is tipped to win today's contest for the leadership of Wandsworth council. Like his predecessor, Sir Paul Beresford, he has an eye on higher things - but compromise is not a word wont to fall from his lips, and his prospects may depend on the selective creed finding a place in Majorism. Mr Lister's political past extends far beyond education. Over the past decade he has chaired most of Wandsworth's leading service committees, and shares Mr Naismith's grasp of figures to justify the borough's 'flagship' status. Contracting out - 'saved us Pounds 26m over five years'. Libraries - 'two libraries out of nine have closed but the book stock and average issues per head are far higher than Lambeth's'. Housing - '17,000 of our 40,000 units sold in the last decade, paying for a capital programme without rival in London'. Underlying it is a firm commitment to local government. Tendering and opting-out will not, pace Nicholas Ridley, result in Wandsworth council meeting just once a year to hand out contracts. 'It will give us time for our real job: monitoring standards, encouraging diversity and, yes, picking up the pieces when things go wrong.' 'The brighter borough' is Wandsworth's slogan. 'Things are brighter,' says Mr Lister in earnest. Should he become captain of the flagship today, he will doubtless place a spotlight on a larger agenda for reform.</p>

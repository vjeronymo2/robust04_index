			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Different museum -- The San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art in La Jolla was  incorrectly identified as the San Diego Museum of Art in Friday's Calendar. As  part of "A Day Without Art," the San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art is  donating today's admissions to AIDS groups and asking visitors to wear a  special pair of vision-reducing glasses while touring the galleries. Also, the  name of artist Alfredo de Batuc was misspelled.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL MISCELLANY;  </P> <P> NAMES AND NUMBERS  </P> <P> Impact: The Texas Rangers have had six sellouts this year, five with Nolan Ryan  pitching and the sixth for a July 4 fireworks promotion. Ryan's 11 starts at  Arlington Stadium have drawn an average paid attendance of 32,648, compared to  23,974 for the club's other 38 dates. Said Ranger President Mike Stone on the  night Ryan bid for his 300th victory: "The kinds of things he has done for this  franchise in terms of national presence you just can't put a number on."  </P> <P> How Do You Figure?: Boston Red Sox pitcher Mike Boddicker, 11-3 against the  rest of the American League, is 0-3 against the Milwaukee Brewers, who have  defeated him by scores of 18-0, 5-0 and 13-0. . . . Pittsburgh Pirate  outfielder Bobby Bonilla, who batted .323 against Montreal last year, is one  for 36 against the Expos this year with 19 strikeouts. . . . The Houston  Astros, who have not had a losing season at home since 1975, the longest such  streak in the major leagues, have won 21 of their last 30 at home this year for  a 29-21 overall record but are 12-38 on the road (through Friday), where they  have lost 25 of their last 28.  </P> <P> Ghastly Boys: It was black Monday for the Atlanta Braves' bullpen. Joe Boever  was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies; Joe Hesketh was released; Charlie  Kerfeld was outrighted to the minors; and Doug Sisk, who has not pitched in the  major leagues since 1988, was acquired from the New York Mets' triple-A farm  club. Atlanta has used 15 relief pitchers this year, and not one has been on  the varsity roster for the entire season. The Braves have blown 17 of 36 save  opportunities, and no member of the current bullpen has more than one save,  though left-hander Kent Mercker, 22, adapting to a relief role, is 4-1 since  his recent recall.  </P> <P> Real Relief: Doug Jones, with 27 saves and four victories Thursday, has shared  in 66% of the Cleveland Indians' wins, giving him a shot at the major league  record of 63.3%, set by the Kansas City Royals' Dan Quisenberry in 1983. . . .  Dave Righetti of the New York Yankees is only the fifth reliever to register 20  or more saves for five consecutive seasons. Bruce Sutter did it for nine years  in a row and Goose Gossage for seven. Jeff Reardon and Lee Smith have a chance  to extend streaks of eight and seven, respectively. . . . The Pirates, much  like the Chicago White Sox, continue to thrive on bullpen by committee. Bill  Landrum is the save leader with 12, but seven Pirates have one or more for a  total of 28, third in the National League through Friday. Pirate relievers also  have a cumulative record of 19-9.  </P> <P> Met Muscle: New York continues to stockpile amazing numbers, particularly since  the appointment of Bud Harrelson as manager, but this may be the most amazing:  The Mets have collected 217 extra-base hits in their last 61 games and have  failed to produce an extra-base hit only once all season. Darryl Strawberry, of  course, has been the catalyst, hitting 21 homers and driving in 53 runs in a  59-game spree.  </P> <P> Equally Hot: That's Lonnie Smith, who has been throwing his weight around since  shedding some winter tonnage. The comeback player of the year with Atlanta last  year, Smith was batting .361 in his last 47 games through Thursday. And since  moving to the leadoff position on June 3, Smith had hit in 24 of 30 games,  batting .379. ROSS NEWHAN  </P></p>

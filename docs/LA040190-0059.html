			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALICE KAHN: LOOK OUT BELOW: SHE'S PERCHED ON A SHAKY PLATEAU  </P> <P> Help! I'm stuck here on this plateau. One false move and I fall onto the  demographic bulge below.  </P> <P> They want my house. They want my job. They want my husband. They only want one  of my 2.3 children.  </P> <P> This is hard. I was trained as a climber. I am part of those last achievers,  the older baby boomers. (Technically, the war was still going on when I was  born. But while I was eating my Pablum, someone dropped the Big One, and when I  turned around there were several million babies fighting for my toys.)  </P> <P> All my life I've had to stay alert or be trounced. Back in the '70s, when I  started jogging, I thought I was pretty unusual. Then I went to my first (and  last) race, the San Francisco Bay to Breakers. Nothing like standing at the  starting line with 50,000 other runners to kill your sense of your own  uniqueness.  </P> <P> I remember hearing the guy behind me say to his friend, "As soon as we get to  the hill, we'll lose these turkeys in front of us."  </P> <P> Every time I thought I was on to something different, it became a major fad  within a year. Two months ago, I announced I liked rap music. Next thing I  knew, it was on the cover of Newsweek. I am now exactly two months ahead of my  time. But who's counting?  </P> <P> So I worry: What happens if I start falling behind, if I lose my grip and fall  off the plateau? Will I lose what I've worked so hard all my life to achieve?  </P> <P> Well, not exactly all my life. If you are part of my generation, you know we  didn't really get started until we were in our 30s. We enjoyed an extended  childhood and the reprieve the late '60s gave us. We spent our 20s "into" every  form of hedonism and self-indulgence known to mankind, including the social  revolutionary fantasy.  </P> <P> But then we hit our 30s off and running. Overnight, we became workaholics and  entrepreneurs and parents. You know what I'm talking about if -- in the last 10  years -- you have acquired five or more of the following: a VCR, a computer, a  phone machine, a compact disc player, a microwave, a camcorder, an unused car  and a home mortgage.  </P> <P> We certainly don't need any more stuff; in fact, we probably didn't need all  this stuff. But now the struggle is not to lose what we've got.  </P> <P> I get scared. I get scared, in this 15-minutes-of-fame, what's-hot/what's-not  world, that I'll be discarded. I panicked when I read a description of a young  actress: "She's as hot as early Meryl Streep." What does that make me? As unhot  as mid-life Alice Kahn.  </P> <P> Stanford Research Institute futurist Tom Mandel has said: "The '90s will be the  decade of the mid-life crisis." I wonder if I'll survive it without the escape  routes of my youth.  </P> <P> The sexual fantasyland is becoming more like Disneyland. The other night, as I  was drooling over Charlie Sheen, my daughter had the bad manners to remind me,  "Mom, puh-leeze, he's young enough to be your son."  </P> <P> At parties, while talking to a cute guy, I do some complicated math in my head.  </P> <P> The exercise fantasyland no longer works either. I used to think I could count  on jogging for a perpetual sense of upward mobility. But I now struggle to do  in a week what I once could do in a day's run.  </P> <P> So I'm on this plateau hanging on for dear life. I look below and get dizzy. I  look up and see that craggy peak. And sometimes I want to turn to the gang  that's plateauing with me and say: "Hey, you guys, why don't we just stop right  here and have some fun?"  </P></p>

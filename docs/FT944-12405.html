			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / (CORRECTED) Lautro raps life company's pension deals Correction (published 3rd November 1994) appended to this article. Small employers who bought off-the-peg occupation pension schemes from Crown Life sales agents following poor investment advice may be eligible for compensation, says Lautro, the self-regulating body for the insurance industry. According to the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service more than 4,700 of about 5,500 group occupational schemes sold by Crown Life have been wound up. The advisory service said that in many cases independent trustees to the schemes are finding it impossible to reconcile pension assets with scheme members because record-keeping was so poor. Lautro, whose work is being taken over by the Personal Investment Authority, said yesterday that in inspection visits to Century Life, which acquired the pensions business from Crown Life in January last year, it found 'significant breaches of Lautro rules covering compliance procedures and the quality of investment advice'. Mr Don Hall, chief executive of the advisory service, said Crown Life sales agents sold group 'defined benefit' schemes to small employers for whom they were probably inappropriate. Complaints from members of Crown Life schemes accounted for a disproportionate number of the complaints received about schemes administered by insurance companies. Lautro said its monitoring committee outlined the requirement for a comprehensive review of the business and 'appropriate corrective measures in relation to management of the sales operation and the compensation of investors where appropriate'. It had decided that a full hearing before its disciplinary committee was unwarranted because Century had taken steps to place the business of Crown on a proper regulatory basis. Lautro said Century 'had good reason to believe that an acceptable state of compliance existed' in Crown's business. CORRECTION The criticisms by Lautro reported in Tuesday's Financial Times under the heading 'Lautro raps life company's pension deals' related to CCL Assurance, not to Crown Life as inaccurately stated in the report. Century Life has acquired the pensions business both of CCL Assurance and of Crown Life and there has been no criticism by Lautro of Crown Life.</p>

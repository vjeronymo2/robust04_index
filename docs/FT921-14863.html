			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Real Time hit by delivery changes Pre-tax profits at Real Time Control dropped from Pounds 661,000 to Pounds 507,000 in the half year to September 29 1991. Turnover fell from Pounds 4.36m to Pounds 3m - but that could be attributed to a change in the timing of deliveries, said Mr Byron Carrell, chairman. The principal contribution came from supplying electronic point of sale systems. The group entered the second half with a good order book and Mr Carrell is hoping for a full year result in line with last year's record Pounds 1.2m. Earnings worked through at 4.9p (6.1p).</p>

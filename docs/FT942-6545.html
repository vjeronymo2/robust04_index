			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Working Life: School's out at Allied-Lyons - Jobs How do you train a group of busy part-time workers, of varying ages, literacy and backgrounds? One way is to let them teach themselves with the help of a computer. Allied-Lyons Retailing, part of the UK food and drink group, says it is the first brewer to introduce on-line, interactive, computer-based training as a tool to improve service in its pubs, which employ a high percentage of part-time staff. More than 20 outlets in London already have the open - or distance - learning system, and it is intended that by the end of the year it will be available in all Allied's 2,000 retail outlets. 'It is difficult to get part-time workers together to train,' says Mr Richard Lowe, the group's head of retail marketing. 'So we have designed a computer-based system into which staff can dip.' Individuals signing on to the interactive system are informed about their group and then offered a number of quizzes over how the best service is provided. A second package, looking in more detail at health and safety issues, is to be introduced soon. Open learning has been used for some years but is now being applied to more diverse needs. A recent survey found the system - used by employers as diverse as Rover and Rank Xerox - to be one of the fastest growing forms of training delivery in the UK. The reasons for this are fairly simple: it is relatively cheap, compared with conventional training; it is flexible; and it can provide effective training without the need for employees to take regular time away from their workplace. Employees seem to like it too as it can offer courses that are 'tailor-made' to their needs. Users range from those requiring basic skills, such as bar staff, to those wanting to learn complex tasks, such as British Telecommunications explaining the introduction of a new technical system to every manager in the country. BT says: 'Normally this would have meant a day off work to attend a training session, at a cost of at least Pounds 150 a head. By presenting the information on a videodisc, which managers could view quickly, locally and at a convenient time, we reduced the cost of the exercise to Pounds 15 per manager.'</p>

"We are here today to proclaim before the world, our  freedom and sovereignty and our unwavering will to defend it at  all costs," he told several thousand Zulus at a gathering in  Ulundi.    The king's proclamation follows the opening of the 1994  session of the kwaZulu legislative assembly [KLA]. Speculation  was rife in Ulundi that the KLA would formally proclaim an  independent sovereign Zulu kingdom encompassing the entire  kwaZulu/Natal region during the current session.    A senior kwaZulu government source said the king's  announcement on Friday could be interpreted as a forerunner to  an official proclamation.    King Zwelithini warned State President F. W. de Klerk  earlier  this year that he was preparing to promulgate a constitution for  kwaZulu/Natal, unless his demands for recognition of his  kingdom's sovereignty were met. KwaZulu Chief Minister  Mangosuthu Buthelezi usually delivers a lengthy policy speech  during the KLA session and the source said a formal proclamation  could emerge during this speech, which begins on Monday.    In his address outside the KLA building, the king called on  all Zulus to unite and defend their freedom, saying elections  under the present constitution would deny the Zulu nation its  claim to sovereignty and self-determination. He reiterated he  could not recommend to his loyal subjects that they vote in the  April election.    "I call on all Zulus to unite in the name of the kingdom of  kwaZulu. I call on all Zulus to fulfil their sacred duty to  defend our freedom and sovereignty to anyone in southern Africa  who dares to challenge it."    He alleged Mr de Klerk's "contingency plans" for the  Natal/kwaZulu region entailed the deployment of security forces  "to clamp down on my people should they choose not to  participate in the elections".    Elections under the interim constitution were "an immediate  denial of our claim for sovereignty and self-determination". "I  find it quite impossible to recommend that any of my subjects  who are loyal to the throne should participate in the  forthcoming election, unless this matter (a sovereign Zulu  kingdom) is settled."    He revealed that recent discussions between himself and Mr  de  Klerk on the Zulu king's claims had made little progress, adding  the South African Government had denied sovereignty to the Zulu  nation and would not restore a sovereign kwaZulu kingdom.  "Under the terms of a final proposal of the South African  Government, the Zulu nation and the kingdom of kwaZulu are left  at the mercy of the unitary state established by the 1993  constitution. We have reached the end of a road and we are  faced with the harsh reality that the SA Government cannot and  will not facilitate the restoration of the sovereign kingdom of  kwaZulu."    Zulus were faced with an historical dilemma of either  succumbing and forever relinquishing their sovereignty or to  take it upon themselves "and bring into existence what is ours,  what belonged to our fathers and what belongs to our children".    The king alleged Mr de Klerk had threatened to deploy his  security forces if Zulus did not vote in the April poll. "I  protest for the betrayals that the Zulu nation have suffered  from President de Klerk again and again."</p>

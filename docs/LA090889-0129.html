			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: TUSTIN;  </P> <P> RESIDENTS PROPOSE PROBLEM-SOLVING AGENCY  </P> <P> Discouraged by what it calls local government's inability to solve neighborhood  problems, a group of Tustin residents has proposed the creation of a volunteer  problem-solving agency.  </P> <P> The Tustin City Problem Resolution Center would offer residents a "voice in the  solution process" of minor problems, said Berklee Maughan, a retiree and  25-year Tustin resident who is leading the effort to establish the center.  </P> <P> Maughan said the idea would give residents more of a direct role in tackling  city problems while giving the City Council time to deal with weightier issues  such as growth.  </P> <P> According to Maughan, residents of Green Valley Avenue in North Tustin have  spent two years battling city officials in an attempt to resolve such problems  as street-sweeping schedules and parking restrictions.  </P> <P> "Our attempts to resolve our problems have caused the Green Valley residents to  focus on why the city problem-resolution process has proven unsuccessful," he  said, blaming that failure on a lack of input from citizens and lower-level  city staff.  </P> <P> Although the council agreed at the Aug. 21 meeting to research the proposal for  45 days, at least one member has voiced disapproval.  </P> <P> Saying such an intermediary group would only serve to "dilute the  effectiveness" of the council, Councilman Richard B. Edgar said Tustin should  work instead to better inform its residents about the workings of local  government.  </P> <P> "The real challenge is to make people come before the City Council when they  need a problem solved," he said.  </P> <P> At this week's Tustin council meeting, Maughan suggested to the council that  the city poll its residents on the desirability of creating such a group.  </P> <P> "I think this is an issue the people need to speak out on," he said.  </P></p>

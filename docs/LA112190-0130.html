			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IN-LAWS CAN PUT FAMILIES TO TEST AT HOLIDAY TIME;  </P> <P> RELATIONS: WHERE TO SPEND THANKSGIVING: MY FAMILY OR YOURS? RATHER THAN CHOOSE,  SOME WIVES AND HUSBANDS JUST FEIGN SICKNESS AND THUS DON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE.  </P> <P> Carla Smith always enjoys the Thanksgivings that she and her husband, Joe,  spend at her parents' home in Whittier. For her, it's a warm and festive  occasion where she can be with her brother and sister and her six nieces and  nephews.  </P> <P> But the Newport Beach woman is not looking forward to Thanksgiving this year:  She'll once again be spending it at her in-laws' home in San Diego.  </P> <P> "I guess I sort of resent it," said Smith, 32. "I enjoy my husband's family,  but I just like being home at Thanksgiving. My mother-in-law is getting up in  years and she doesn't really care to cook any longer. Last year, they just  bought a turkey at the store that was already prepared. Thanksgiving, to me, is  always a fun time at my parents' home because everything's home-made and it's  just a nice, warm, fun time."  </P> <P> Smith, who asked that her real name not be used, laughed nervously.  </P> <P> "I feel like I'm bashing my in-laws," she said. "I don't mean to. I just don't  feel as close or as comfortable with his parents as I obviously do with mine."  </P> <P> Smith is not the only in-law who feels torn during the holiday season.  </P> <P> For many couples, the dilemma of which set of parents to spend Thanksgiving or  Christmas with is an annual crisis, one that can strain even the best of  relationships.  </P> <P> Mickie Shapiro, a Costa Mesa marriage, family and child therapist, said she has  several clients who get sick every year at Thanksgiving.  </P> <P> "Even knowing they're going to get sick doesn't stop them," Shapiro said. "The  reason they get sick is because there's such a pull to be with their own  parents. The way to avoid it is to get sick and not go anywhere."  </P> <P> Christmas is no different. Shapiro said several clients have attempted to solve  the dilemma by visiting one set of in-laws on Christmas eve and the other on  Christmas morning. But even that isn't the ideal solution.  </P> <P> "They don't look forward to the holiday, " Shapiro explained. "They just say  they're so stressed out and exhausted."  </P> <P> Chicago psychotherapist Leah Shifrin Averick, the author of a book on in-law  relations, says it's natural for parents to want their children present on  holidays. But both sets of parents often demand equal time with the young  couple, or the couple feels that they should spend equal time with each set of  parents.  </P> <P> Averick said parents often don't realize the difficulties that their married  children experience in trying to balance loyalties to their parents as well as  to themselves.  </P> <P> One woman interviewed by Averick for her book, "How Inlaws Relate," attempted  to solve the problem by having two Thanksgiving dinners, one with each set of  parents.  </P> <P> "It was," the woman said, "like a tug of war and we were the rope."  </P> <P> Such tugging, therapists say, can lead to frustration, resentment and anger.  </P> <P> "Some parents can be really controlling and they can create tremendous pressure  and pain during the holidays. They make the younger adults feel guilty," said  Jerry Deming, director of the Marriage and Family Counseling Center of Orange  County in Tustin.  </P> <P> San Clemente psychotherapist Bobbi Nesheim says: "Whenever you move into any  holiday or special time in your life with anger and frustration it's not going  to work out. The best thing you can do is take a look at what is causing your  frustration and then negotiate: 'What can we do about it? What do we really  want out of this?' "  </P> <P> Even in the best of circumstances, Averick said, parents and their married  children often have unrealistic expectations of holiday get-togethers. And it's  when the fantasy clashes with reality that there is tension.  </P> <P> "Usually, when there is tension and difficulty, I think it's because the child  -- the son, for example -- is hoping mom is going to make his favorite apple  pie, or that dad will play golf with him," Averick suggested. "He doesn't  realize mama is tired and maybe has a job now and doesn't have time to make his  favorite apple pie. And dad has arthritis and can't play golf like he used to.  So then there are disappointments when a child goes back home."  </P> <P> And while a son may have unrealistic expectations about visiting his parents on  the holidays, Averick said, "along comes a daughter-in-law who has no fantasies  about these people and no old wishes, dreams and hopes of being with them.  </P> <P> "She'd rather be around her own family, where she was nurtured and loved and  admired so much. And the daughter-in-law gets bored with the family history and  whatever tales we have. It's not so much fun for her and she might feel  excluded."  </P> <P> Matters are made even worse if there is underlying tension between, say, a  daughter-in-law and mother-in-law.  </P> <P> "How does this critical, stereotypical person you resent turn into a charming,  wonderful, tolerant grandparent? And does she?" Averick asked. "And what's it  like even from the viewpoint of the grandchildren if you go to a grandmother  you know your mother doesn't like?"  </P> <P> There are, Averick said, "all kinds of clashing wishes and realities that are  in juxtaposition with one another. And that's why holidays are often so  disappointing instead of so satisfying."  </P> <P> So what's a family to do?  </P> <P> "If you're forewarned about these things -- if you know what to expect -- then  you can handle things better," Averick advised. "You're not going back to what  it used to be, you're going back to what it is now."  </P> <P> So instead of saying, "Mom's going to take care of me and my children while  we're visiting," Averick suggests instead saying, "Mom is older and too tired  to take care of us; I better plan to help when I go back home."  </P> <P> And instead of assuming that mom and dad will still have your old toys for your  children to play with, have your children bring their own toys. And, Averick  said, parents should be informed ahead of time if your kids like Cheerios or  something special for breakfast.  </P> <P> Older parents and in-laws have their own expectations for the holidays. While  they are thrilled to have their son or daughter back home, Averick said, they  also may be concerned about what the grandchildren will do to their new  carpeting and drapes: Who is going to mind the kids and remind them not to put  their sticky fingers on grandma's new curtains?  </P> <P> That, too, should be determined ahead of time, Averick said.  </P> <P> Families also should discuss how they're going to spend the day. The parents  may want their children and grandchildren to spend the entire day with them,  but their children may prefer to visit old friends or go to a movie after  dinner.  </P> <P> "If you spell out what you need and want ahead of time, the visit can be  pleasant," she said.  </P> <P> And what if the daughter-in-law, for example, just doesn't like her mother-in  law, or vice versa?  </P> <P> "Usually," Averick said, "when they don't like each other, it's because there  have been some hurt feelings, or people forgetting to say thank you after all  this effort that has been extended. This 'thank you' is sort of forgotten in  our culture."  </P> <P> Everyone, Averick emphasized, needs to feel important and appreciated.  </P> <P> "If they say, 'Gee, mom, it's been so nice, all these goodies you've provided  for us,' the mother or mother-in-law is thrilled."  </P> <P> At her fourth son's wedding a year ago, Averick's new daughter-in-law took her  aside and said, "Thank you so much for Benjie."  </P> <P> "I still get a shiver," Averick said. "I feel so warm toward that woman. She  acknowledged my importance, my function as a mother, my contribution to her  life."  </P> <P> Actually, Averick said, thank-yous should be extended at some point during the  day to everyone seated around the holiday dinner table: To mom, who cooked the  meal; to dad, who may have provided airline tickets for his son and family; to  the daughter-in-law, who brought the lovely flower arrangement; to the son, who  took time out of his schedule to be with his parents, and the little  grandchild, who made a drawing for her grandparents.  </P> <P> "If everybody has been acknowledged," Averick said, "everyone's feeling good  around the table, feeling good because they appreciate each other."  </P> <P> As for the dilemma of which set of parents to holiday with, Averick offers  these suggestions:  </P> <P> * Parents must remember that their children cannot be in two places at the same  time.  </P> <P> * "Don't put unreasonable pressure on your children to spend time with you,"  she said, "Respect the couple's decision if they choose not to accept your  invitation to visit."  </P> <P> Parents of married children, she added, must realize that their parenting role  is not the same as before: "You can make the same demands, but it's  inappropriate."  </P> <P> For adult children, Averick advises this: "If you cannot or do not want to  accept your parents' invitations, don't be evasive, but tell them as soon as  possible. Hopefully, your parents will understand and respect your decision."  </P> <P> Averick said the young couple should first decide among themselves where it  will be most comfortable, convenient and pleasant for them to spend the  holiday.  </P> <P> "Then you go back and he tells his parents and she tells her parents," she  said, explaining: "Parents are able to forgive their own child no matter what  he does. Even if they get angry, the parent-child love ties are still there."  </P></p>

			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Loss of direction at the crossroads: Israel's politicians are preoccupied with past disputes ahead of tomorrow's general election The campaign for tomorrow's general election in Israel has been dominated by old wars, old men and old insults. Strangely lacking has been a serious debate about the immense changes the Middle East has undergone since the last election in 1988. The Soviet Union, for decades the main sponsor of Israel's Arab enemies, has withered and died. The US, Israel's guardian ally, is pre-eminent in the region. Saddam Hussein's Iraq, only two years ago a powerful and ominous shadow to Israel's east, has been vanquished in a war in which Israel was a de facto ally with its greatest foe, Syria, and other Arab powers. For the first time, Arab nations have come to the negotiating table for peace talks constructed by the US on terms largely favourable to Israel. The Palestine Liberation Organisation has been kept at arms length and has accepted that any discussion of Palestinian independence be postponed for at least three years after an interim stage of limited self-rule is agreed, something it used to reject outright. But rather than address these remarkable developments, the ruling Likud party, led by 76-year-old Mr Yitzhak Shamir, has preferred to spend the campaign maligning the opposition Labour party as a pro-Arab nest of Bolsheviks. For its part, Labour has wallowed in the military record of its 70-year-old leader, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, chief of staff during the triumphant Six Day War 25 years ago this month. There have been many slogans, but precious little real discussion about the great strategic and economic challenges facing Israel as a consequence of the events of the past few years. The disappearance of Soviet influence, coupled with Washington's growing strategic interest in the Gulf, has undermined the link to the US. This was sharply illustrated in the acrimonious breakdown early this year of Israel's appeal for Dollars 10bn in US loan guarantees to aid the absorption of mass immigration from the former Soviet Union, itself a consequence of Moscow's collapse. The prospect of diminishing access to US aid has highlighted the failure by Israel to achieve a flourishing, independent economy to take advantage of the demographic 'critical mass' Russian immigration offers Israel. The lack of significant growth has led thousands of Russian Jews to suspend plans to emigrate, a damning judgment for Israel on the relative economic outlook in the two lands. Above all, the peace talks launched last October in Madrid, though slow to gain momentum, will before long require Israel to make the tough choices about its future it has avoided since 1967. It will have to decide what to do about the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights - to say nothing of East Jerusalem - all captured from Jordan and Syria and most of which the international community, including the US, expects Israel to yield in exchange for peace. Labour has pledged to drop Likud's commitment to hold all the territory in perpetuity. It promises to push ahead with the peace process. But it has avoided giving any detail about its intentions. Mr Rabin has made his election pitch more an attempt to steal the clothes of the Likud than to blaze a path to the future. 'If you look at the television campaigns, the slogans in the newspapers and so on, it seems as if they are debating the past and not the present,' says Mr Arye Na'or, a former cabinet secretary to Menachem Begin, the late Likud premier. 'The leaders believe the nation is not ready to draw the consequences of the changes in the world and they do not pave the way.' Mr Na'or decries this lack of leadership. But he shares the belief that the Israeli people are largely unmoved by the great events of the past few years, distrusting the motive of the Arabs in coming to the peace talks. 'They continue to see the walls of the siege and they don't see the windows of opportunity in the walls.' But is this really so? Many Israelis clearly do perceive that the country is at an important crossroads. Mr Na'or himself is among those who feel a great opportunity is being presented to Israel which the government should not fail to grasp. Opinion polls have shown consistently strong support for the Madrid process, even among Likud supporters whose leaders remain steadfastly opposed to the 'land for peace' formula upon which it is based. Some younger Israelis think the problem lies not just in the unbending ideology of Mr Shamir and the Likud, but in the continued domination of the old generation of politicians whose thinking remains anchored in the traumatic past of the Nazi holocaust, the battle to establish Israel in 1948 and the wars which followed. 'I am afraid that where we used to be the rational ones, and the Arabs irrational, we have now become irrational and the Arabs rational in assessing the situation in the Middle East,' said a prominent young Tel Aviv businessman in private conversation recently. It is among businessmen, especially those involved in exporting, that the importance of taking advantage of the Madrid peace talks is often most clearly advocated. Aside from the political benefits, they can see the rewards from the opening of markets - closed until now - in Israel's natural Middle Eastern hinterland and the elusive inward investment that could be unlocked by political stability. The economic future of Israel has probably never been more intertwined with the political. As the US loan guarantee issue showed, the country's longstanding reliance on foreign aid, overwhelmingly from Washington, is set to be tied more closely to the government's policies towards the peace process. This has occurred just as Israel has to find the resources to cope with the flood of immigration which has already increased the population by about 400,000 to 5m in the space of two years. So far the record is not encouraging. Despite a construction-induced boom last year, real industrial growth has failed to take off, leaving overall unemployment at a record 11.5 per cent of the workforce and more than one third of immigrants without a job. Immi-gration has slumped, putting in jeopardy the Zionist dream of attracting more than 1m Russian Jews to strengthen the country demographically and drive the economy forward. Much of the blame is put down to a lack of radical reform of the domestic economy in which the government is still an all-powerful player. 'Nowhere in the developed world is government still so involved in the control and allocation of resources as in Israel,' says Mr Stephen Plaut, a business economist at Haifa University. 'The direction of change is very slowly in the right direction, but it is very, very slow. I think we still need a quantum leap.' He says without long-term growth, not only will the goal of attracting immigration fail, but the burden of supporting Israel's large defence commitment - almost 20 per cent of GNP - will become more difficult to sustain. 'In Israel, if the economy is inefficient it is a strategic problem. A lack of growth is destabilising because it tempts the other side into seeing us as weak.' Both the Likud and Labour are committed publicly to accelerating market reforms. But neither has articulated any detailed economic programme during the election campaign. There remains the suspicion that their vested political interests in the old system will continue to erode their commitment to reform. Labour is still bound to the Histadrut trade union federation, the power of which depends largely on the economic status quo, while the Likud has long exploited government patronage to channel favours to its bedrock constituencies. Even if the main parties finally do enact domestic reform, it may not be enough. 'The economy of Israel is going to be handicapped until we have a real peace process,' says Mr Aharon Dovrat, former chief of Clal Industries and now head of his own investment house. 'We should move much more aggressively than we have up to now.' What are the prospects, then, for a break in the logjam on Tuesday, given that in Israel no party ever wins an outright majority? Labour is hoping that public support for the peace process, coupled with frustration over Likud's ambiguous attitude towards the negotiations and its dismal economic record, will translate into the most significant pro-Labour swing since Likud came to power in 1977. In theory, that could lead to a Labour-led coalition excluding the Likud which would shed its pre-election reticence and move forward boldly to unlock the peace process. But that remains an unlikely scenario, unless the opinion polls are underestimating support for Labour and its small party allies. Indeed, polls suggest Mr Shamir might be able to reconstruct his coalition of Likud, extreme right-wing and religious parties. In that case it is hard to see how the peace talks could advance, given the extreme right's objection even to Palestinian autonomy. The decisive question in the intense coalition bargaining that will start on Wednesday will be what Mr Rabin and Mr Shamir both want. Mr Shamir is unshakeable in his opposition to giving up territory. He is, according to colleagues, very concerned that even conceding autonomy could lead ultimately to that end. But he has to take into account not only the strong support for the peace process within Likud, but also the immense, perhaps unbearable, international pressure Israel would come under if it withdrew from the talks. At the same time, Mr Rabin is concerned not to expose himself to all-out opposition from the right if he goes ahead with negotiations. He would prefer to take the Likud with him into an interim settlement on the occupied territories, leaving aside underlying ideological differences on the issue of 'land for peace' until final settlement talks begin several years down the road. Thus many Israelis believe the next government will be a Labour-Likud coalition of the type which was in office from 1984 until 1990. However, the 'National Unity' governments proved more a formula for paralysis than progress, both domestically and externally. There is no guarantee it would be any different again, despite the existence this time of a mechanism for peace talks.</p>

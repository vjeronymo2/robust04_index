			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CREDENTIALS OF CAL STATE OFFICIAL  </P> <P> Marianthi Lansdale, chairwoman of the California State University trustees, not  only misstated her academic credentials but also demonstrated an unacceptable  arrogance for her position on the board and to the citizens of the state.  </P> <P> We do read The Times, and far more importantly, we do care. Personally, I care  greatly that she "doesn't care," and that she apparently cannot read well  enough to fill out application forms. If she reads poorly and doesn't care what  her word means, well, it seems perhaps she earned her degree from a phone book.  </P> <P> Political appointees traditionally are the result of contributions, in essence  purchased, but if she is such an example of job selection then future choices  from the phone book could hardly be worse.  </P> <P> I also find disappointing the comment of CSU Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds  because, while trustees "cannot" be held to the same standards, they certainly  should be since they oversee the process.  </P> <P> Along with Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti, I support her stepping  down.  </P> <P> BOB McGUIRE  </P> <P> Yorba Linda  </P></p>

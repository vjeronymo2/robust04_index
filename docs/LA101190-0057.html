			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MEINERS OAKS;  </P> <P> COUNTY COULD HAVE RESTRICTED DRILLING  </P> <P> A well-drilling operation in the Ventura River would not have been allowed to  run day and night if county officials had realized the noise was going to carry  throughout Meiners Oaks, an official said Wednesday.  </P> <P> "This is a lesson to us," said John Crowley, senior hydrologist with Ventura  County Water Resources Department.  </P> <P> "When a well-drilling permit is issued in a city or urban area, we usually  condition it to operate within certain hours," Crowley said.  </P> <P> "With this one, we thought the nearest residence was three-quarters of a mile  away. We didn't anticipate any problem."  </P> <P> Instead, the river channel amplified the sound like a drum, Crowley said, as  the large rotary rig drilled around the clock since last Thursday.  </P> <P> Rotary drills usually operate 24 hours a day to prevent cave-ins, he said, but  the operator, Midway Drilling,could have been asked to stop work at 9 p.m.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, after the holiday weekend, a local water company received more than  a dozen complaints, while the Sheriff's Department told residents that its  hands were tied because the county permit did not restrict operating hours.  </P> <P> "We issue 300 permits a year and get a complaint of noise about once every five  years," Crowley said.  </P> <P> Drilling the 200-foot-deep well for Farmont Corp. to irrigate citrus groves and  water cattle also took longer than expected due to the number of boulders in  the dry, rocky riverbed, Crowley said.

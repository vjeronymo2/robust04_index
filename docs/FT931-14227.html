			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (29): Realignment in a world market - Corporate strategy, a Franco-British bid for a place in the power game AT FIRST glance, it seems surprising that the move towards a single market was not a large factor in the creation in June, 1989, of GEC Alsthom, one of Europe's big three power engineering and transportation equipment groups. The formation of the company from the power and transportation product businesses of the UK's GEC and what was then CGE of France owed more to developments in the world markets for these products, the need to be big enough to continue financing product development and compete internationally, and the requirement to reduce manufacturing overcapacity. But the company recognised that Europe was to be its home market, even if the single market was not predominant in the decision to merge. About 60 per cent of sales are to countries within the EC, and GEC Alsthom expects the figure to stay between 50 and 60 per cent in the next few years. GEC Alsthom's organisation - a Dutch holding company and national companies  -was driven by the existing legal and fiscal regimes rather than any potential implications of a single market. But the company's industrial strategy was to become as competitive as possible by the development of areas of excellence without regard to geographic location, through a series of multinational product-driven divisions. A clear example of this is in steam turbines and generators, where GEC Alsthom has concentrated on four specialist units to get the benefit of R&amp;D rationalisation and volume manufacture, and to maximise the use of fixed assets. 'The consequence of this,' it says, 'is that we only have a European product and no longer have an exclusive British or French turbine generator.' From its earliest days, GEC Alsthom was also keen to grow its European base by expanding outside its two home countries. In particular,it has made acquisitions in Germany (including two boiler makers in eastern Germany), in the Spanish rail transport industry, and in Italy, Belgium and Switzerland. Three years on, the company has no reason to change its structure. 'We always thought that, even with the emergence of the Single Market, a strong local market close to the customers would be a plus and it still proves to be correct. Beyond that our choice in running a company through a series of multinational product-driven divisions has proved a very sensible decision in the light of the Single Market.' One of the advantages for GEC Alsthom in taking this approach is in dealings with a single market that varies from product to product in its 'singleness'. Assuming that the EC continues to exist in something like its present form, the company suspects a 'substantial implementation' of a single market by the end of the century. In the meantime the company has to deal with sectors such as the rail industry, where national standards, operating practices and the dominance of a single customer has perpetuated a system where suppliers and customers have worked together to develop products for domestic markets. But similar relationships in the power industry are now being weakened, at least in the UK where the power industry has been privatised, and elsewhere in Europe with the emergence of build-and-operate private sector power stations. The company has no doubt that, as a European company with only about 20 per cent of its capacity outside the EC, it is much better in competitive terms to be within the single market than trying to penetrate from outside. That presence could become more important for large engineering companies such as GEC Alsthom in view of the EC's new rules for opening up public procurement contracts to competitive bidding. These will continue the process of loosening the close ties between suppliers and public customers in some European markets. Looking back on the past three years, GEC Alsthom says it has learnt from the experience of operating in the EC's different domestic markets, and has been able to increase the amount of inter-country activities on particular projects. 'Such lessons as we have learnt as the single market approaches have been learnt because the people who make up the management of GEC Alsthom have succeeded in fusing together their individual experience as Britons, Frenchmen, Germans, Spaniards, Belgians, or other nationals.'</p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Rampaging bulls AMID THE besetting gloom on world stock markets, it is rare to find investors queueing to buy new share issues; rarer still to find an exchange the subject of a riot by tens of thousands of over-enthusiastic citizens. Yet that is precisely what unfolded in the southern Chinese town of Shenzhen this week, as angry would-be investors rampaged after being excluded from the local stock exchange's latest share issues. While such civil strife is bound to evoke memories of the bloody crackdown of June 1989, this was no Tiananmen. The authorities, conscious that Shenzhen is the showcase of China's market reforms, seem to have handled the violence with restraint. But the events of Monday night did spell out an important message concerning the pace and scale of economic reform - one which China's Communist rulers would be most unwise to ignore as they prepare to debate the issue at their 14th party congress this autumn. In one sense, the Shenzhen riots might seem a setback for reform. Party conservatives will argue that they highlight the threat to stability posed by no-holds-barred liberalisation. In fact, the opposite is true: the riots illustrate violent enthusiasm for the sort of reforms that are favoured by Mr Deng Xiaoping, the nation's pre-eminent leader, and that are producing double-digit economic growth rates. But they also illustrate the dangers inherent in China's erratic approach to the market - and the pent-up pressures for faster reform. The speculation, and accompanying corruption, in Shenzhen is symptomatic of one of China's basic structural problems: the disparity between vast liquidity in private hands and limited opportunities for private investment. This gap, coupled with the authorities' tendency to let go of the monetary reins at a time of reform, has been largely responsible for the 'stop-go' cycle of overheating and deflation displayed by the Chinese economy in the past decade. All the signs are that the overheating is now happening again, fuelled by a surge in credit to prop up state industry. To help avert another crash-landing, with potentially worrying political consequences, the authorities need to move rapidly to create more investment opportunities - in fixed assets such as housing, for example - to liberalise consumer prices further, and to put their own finances in order. This week's events carry another warning for the gerontocrats in Beijing, for they show how the huge regional disparities in China's economic development can breed unrest. It was policy in the 1980s to relax state controls only in certain ring-fenced areas of the south, but this has become untenable. The reform bug is catching: people are flocking to park their money in Shenzhen from all over the country. If China is to avoid national discord born of regional anomalies, the government must not only advance reform in the south, but also allow other regions to emulate the Guangdong experiment.</p>

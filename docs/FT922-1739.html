			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Cautious mortgage lenders redo their sums - Expenditure and net income are becoming part of the home loan calculations FOR many years, income has been the standard yardstick for judging the size of the mortgage which a house buyer can afford. For couples the formula has been three plus one: that is, three times the larger income plus the smaller income multiplied by one. A single person can expect to get a mortgage of up to three times his or her annual salary. As many families can ruefully testify, borrowing on this scale can be quite painful, particularly if you take out your mortgage when rates are low and then find yourself struggling to keep up with the monthly payments when interest rates are higher. In the 1980s housing boom, that fact did not deter some building societies from lending much larger amounts to their customers. Some lenders were willing to advance up to five times a customer's annual income. If you are applying for a mortgage these days, you may well find yourself being asked to fill in a form listing your monthly outgoings or you may have to give information to your mortgage broker who will perform this task for you. Calculations are based on post-tax net monthly income, and existing borrowing, mortgage and any car loans only. Utility payments such as gas and electricity bills are not necessarily needed. Nationwide, the second largest building society, now asks customers whose loans are over 90 per cent of the value of the property to supply details of their income and spending, some other societies do the same. These details are usually not very rigidly policed, but they do give the lender a more exact idea of how affluent (or not) its prospective customer is. Borrowers are forced to think about exactly how much cash they will have in hand each month, once the direct debit on the mortgage starts to operate. Affordability measures of this sort are also used behind the scenes by some lenders as a way of double-checking whether they should make a particular loan or not. If you get into trouble keeping up your payments on an existing mortgage, you will find that your lender quickly steps in to measure your monthly outgoings. National Westminster, the second largest high street bank, asks customers who have missed two month's mortgage payments to fill in a form on monthly outgoings to help assess their ability to recover Customers are not obliged to fill in the form, though anyone two months behind with the payments on their home is not best-advised to get on the wrong side of their lender. The most radical step has been taken by BNP Mortgages, the UK offshoot of the French bank, which asks its customers to go through a much more complex set of measurements of their disposable cash to show that they can afford the mortgage they are contemplating. Donald Cameron-Moore, chief executive of BNP Mortgage says that BNP will lend mortgages whose monthly payments are up to 35 per cent of the net income of a customer, after tax and other deductions including car and travel expenses. 'The result is that we lend less than competitors using the traditional multiple, but we do lend more on joint applications on mortgages up to Pounds 100,000,' says Cameron-Moore. He believes that some intermediaries appreciate the system since it reduces the risks for both borrowers and intermediaries. 'I have my doubts about whether these new measurements will make much difference to the market. The question is what happens to interest rates. If they go up again, you will have the same problem.' says Ian Darby, managing director of John Charcol, the mortgage lender. There are already some signs that building societies do not like cumbersome restrictions which interfere with the flow of business in a thin market. For example, in a move designed to make mortgage fraud more difficult, some lenders were demanding that borrowers produce identity documents such as a birth certificate, driving licence or community charge book if they came from intermediaries, but they now seem to be relaxing these requirements.</p>

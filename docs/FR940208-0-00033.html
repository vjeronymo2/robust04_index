			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, the Director is removing the required program amendments as identified above from the Iowa program and as codified at 30 CFR 915.16. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 6. IAC 27&hyph;40.1 (3) and (4), IAC 27&hyph;40.35, IAC 27&hyph;40.37, IAC 27&hyph;40.38, IAC 27&hyph;40.63, and IAC 27&hyph;40.64, Authorization of Land Surveyors <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Iowa proposes to revise its rules at IAC 27&hyph;40.1 (3) and (4) by deleting from 30 CFR 779.25(b), 780.14(c), 780.25(a)(1)(i), 780.25(a)(3)(i), 783.25(b), 784.16(a)(1)(i), 784.16(a)(3)(i), 816.46(b)(3), 816.49(a)(2), 816.49(a)(10)(ii), 816.151(a), 817.46(b)(3), and 817.151(a), as incorporated by reference into the State program, specific language which allows land surveyors to prepare and certify certain cross-sections, maps, and plans. Iowa also proposes, at IAC 27&hyph;40.37 (incorporating 30 CFR Part 783), IAC 27&hyph;40.38 (incorporating 30 CFR Part 784), IAC 27&hyph;40.63 (incorporating 30 CFR Part 816), and IAC 27&hyph;40.64 (incorporating 30 CFR Part 817), to make similar changes to the incorporated language which allows land surveyors to prepare and certify certain cross-sections, maps, and plans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 507(b)(14) of SMCRA and the Federal regulations allow land surveyors to prepare and certify such cross-sections, maps, and plans only to the extent allowed by the State. Thus, this option is discretionary to the State regulatory authority and Iowa's decision not to allow land surveyors to perform such duties does not render Iowa's program inconsistent with SMCRA or the Federal regulations. Iowa, in a previous program amendment submittal, received approval from the Director on November 6, 1991, to prohibit land surveyors from performing design and certification tasks in other locations of its program (56 FR 56578, 56584). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In Iowa's July 8, 1993, response to OSM's May 10, 1993, concerns on this amendment, some of the Federal regulations incorporated by reference at IAC 27&hyph;40.1 (3) and (4) included similar, but slightly different language from the language the State proposed to delete. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, Iowa submitted an editorial clarification to OSM in a letter dated August 20, 1993 (Administrative Record No. IA&hyph;388), to clarify the exact language that the State proposed to delete from the incorporated Federal provisions. Consequently, the Director finds Iowa's proposed revisions at IAC 27&hyph;40.1 (3) and (4), IAC 27&hyph;40.35 (incorporating 30 CFR Part 779), IAC 27&hyph;40.37 (incorporating 30 CFR Part 783), IAC 27&hyph;40.38 (incorporating 30 CFR Part 784), IAC 27&hyph;40.63 (incorporating 30 CFR Part 816), and IAC 27&hyph;40.64 (incorporating 30 CFR Part 816), and IAC 27&hyph;40.64 (incorporating 30 CFR Part 817), to be consistent with SMCRA and the Federal regulations and is approving the revisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7. IAC 27&hyph;40.1(5), Registered, Professional Engineer <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Iowa proposes to revise its rules at IAC 27&hyph;40.1(5) by deleting the words ``registered, professional engineer'' from its incorporation by reference of 30 CFR Parts 779, 780, 783, 784, 816, and 817. Iowa proposes to replace the deleted phrase with the phrase ``professional engineer, registered with the State of Iowa.'' This proposed change insures that professional engineers meet State registration requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Director finds the proposed revision at IAC 27&hyph;40.1(5) to be consistent with SMCRA and the Federal regulations and is approving it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 8.

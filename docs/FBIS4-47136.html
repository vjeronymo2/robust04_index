			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Volodymyr Hrynyov by OBSHCHAYA GAZETA </F> correspondent Arkadiy Romm; place and date not given; under the  rubric "Image": "Centrists Hope To Take Kiev"]    [Text] Volodymyr Hrynyov's name is not on the list of  Ukrainian presidential candidates. A politician popular in the  republic, in the recent past deputy chairman of the Ukrainian  parliament, today he is busy organizing the election campaign of  his confederate in the Interregional Reform Bloc--Leonid Kuchma.  Of course, in the event Kuchma wins, Hrynyov can count on a  leading role in the new Kiev leadership. What ideology does the  "Kuchma team" preach; what will its advent to power mean for  Ukraine, for Russo-Ukrainian relations--this is the topic of our  OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent's interview with Volodymyr  Hrynyov.    [Hrynyov] Within a few months we will have to decide what  kind of state we are building. I personally feel that we are at  a "fork"--we can still slide back into the totalitarian past, or  we can move toward a civilized society. The state that is  currently being built, in my opinion, was "designed" extremely  poorly. Especially unsuccessful was the system of interaction  between the center and the regions. We, those who live in  Ukraine, feel how strong regional instability is. The same may  be said about the economic crisis. No matter what current acting  Prime Minister Yefim Zvyahylskyy tells us, in reality production  is declining, hidden unemployment flourishing, and social  tension growing. In short, the economic situation differs a lot  from the blissful appraisal.    [Romm] Do you see the way out of the crisis?    [Hrynyov] We need a centrist party. Which is precisely what  we are setting up on the basis of our Interregional Reform Bloc.  It would appear that the old parliament did everything possible  to prevent political structuring: The law on elections does not  envisage any party lists. But the process of precisely this kind  of structuring is currently underway in the parliament. It  reflects a public need--the peak of the "antiparty mood" is  behind us; the time has come when people have accepted the idea  of parties pursuing a certain ideology. Today the communist and  socialist parties, as well as Rukh, show that there is no other  way.    [Romm] Since your confederate in the bloc is a presidential  candidate, it is obvious that your party presents itself as a  presidential party, is it not?    [Hrynyov] A president who does not have a base in a certain  political force does not have a chance of governing society.  This is clear in the example of Leonid Kravchuk, who in his  search for support jumps from Rukh to the socialists. One can  also see it in the example of our government, which is in a  "suspended state." Yes, our party thinks of itself as a  presidential party; its program tasks are market reform of the  Ukrainian economy (because we do not have a market); transition  to an open civil society; and the creation of a multinational  state with a federative lands structure.    [Romm] You are frequently accused of being circumspect  toward  Moscow.    [Hrynyov] Yes, Kuchma and I are being accused of betraying  national interests. I am convinced, however, that an attempt to  create some sort of a phenomenon of fast integration with Europe  is precisely the way to lose our independence. For me,  orientation toward Moscow is the only way to survive. If Ukraine  now gives up the Eurasian market, within whose framework its  economy may rise to a civilized level, this will represent a  catastrophic failure of our foreign policy. It can be avoided  only by aligning with Moscow--without groveling before it, of  course.    [Romm] How probable is it that Leonid Kuchma will win the  next presidential elections?    [Hrynyov] Kuchma currently has the best chance. As compared  to the closest rival, Leonid Kravchuk--a five-to-three chance.  But Kravchuk has been rather confidently gaining points lately.  He is conducting a well-calculated election campaign. Our  forecast is that these two candidates will undoubtedly make it  to the second round, and almost neck to neck at that.    [Romm] Are you sure that the elections will not be  postponed?    [Hrynyov] Parliament will not have enough muscle to vote  against the elections.    [Romm] How do you and your confederates in the Interregional  Reform Bloc appraise the Crimean situation and the causes that  brought it about?    [Hrynyov] I already mentioned the degradation of our  economy,  a poorly chosen strategy for the organizational development of  the state, imposing administrative models that are alien to the  regions. All these factors caused the Crimean crisis. Although  Russian politicians contributed their share to this issue as  well.    According to the Crimean constitution in its 1992 version,  Crimea is a sovereign state and builds its relations with all  states on the basis of treaties. It may sign such a treaty with  Ukraine and remain part of it, as Tatarstan is in Russia. If the  Crimean leadership, with popular support, goes all the way,  though, in the best-case scenario the outcome will be secession,  and in the worst--the blood of hundreds of thousands of people.    In our opinion, the Crimean problem may be absorbed by the  problem of Russo-Ukrainian rapprochement. Not too long ago a  meeting of Russian and Ukrainian politicians took place in  Kharkiv. We undertook to develop an ideology of strategic  cooperation in time for the September meeting; it must be  reflected in a joint document to be adopted by the governments  of both countries.    I stay in contact with the Crimean Government and I know  that  everybody there is aware of this: If Crimea remains in this  suspended state for another half a year--with people being  afraid to travel there and everything being extremely  tense--this will be a fiasco for the Crimean authorities.  Destabilization of the situation in the Crimea is not in the  interests of either Ukraine or Russia; therefore, it will be  supported from different sides. Crimea should become a bridge  between our states, not a bone of contention.</p>

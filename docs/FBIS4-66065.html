			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Frankfurt correspondent Eric Le Boucher: "German </F> Model Holding Up"; first paragraph is LE MONDE introduction]    [Text] Across the Rhine, the German-style "bank-industry"  that Credit Lyonnais claimed as its model is holding up well  despite the impact of recession and internationalization.    Frankfurt--In emulation of the "German model," Jean-Yves  Haberer dragged Credit Lyonnais into a series of investments in  manufacturing, business, and service firms.    The bank's former president was not alone in the late  1980's.  The "bank-industry" concept was hot, as was that of the  "bankinsurer," which called for hybridizing insurance companies  and banks. The general idea was to find a solution that would  allow French capitalism to finance itself while at the same time  protecting it from possible hostile takeovers.    The "hard core" system of privatization, which distributed a  strategic fraction of a company's stock among various "friendly"  holders, was widely employed during the first cohabitation, but  it got bad press after 1988, when it was reproached on political  grounds for being too uniformly RPR [Rally for the Republic] in  stripe and on economic grounds for putting too much emphasis on  defending the existing stockholders (including the incumbent  chairman and chief executive office) at the expense of  developing the company's capital.    In short, the hard core solution exhibited the defects of  peculiarly French "inbreeding." It provided the political  framework for connivance among the major national firms in a  generalized "you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours"  arrangement that was in the final analysis fragile and in any  case fainthearted.    At the same time, the Socialists, now back in the driver's  seat, no longer wanted the state to cover the capital  requirements of government-owned companies directly.  <H5>  Portfolio </H5>   Minds are turned to the "German model," which cast banks and  a few insurance companies (including the biggest one, Allianz)  in the central role. To compensate for a lack of capitalists  during its industrialization, nineteenth- century Germany had  relied on banks to mobilize savings indirectly and funnel them  into industry.    The traditional involvement of financial institutions dates  to this period. It is characterized in part by a "Hausbank"  system under which a company relies on its bank for all of its  transaction requirements, from the sale of shares in its stock  to the use of overdraft facilities. Often the German bank itself  may even acquire stock in its customer, either in the event of  difficulties or in order to go in with it on its business.    This system was to be further strengthened after World War  II. German banks, at one point dismembered by the Americans,  were able to plead their case successfully with the help of  Hermann Joseph Abs, the head of the biggest among them, Deutsche  Bank. They reorganized as "universal banks," which were  authorized to do everything at a time when U.S. banks were  narrowly limited in scope. German universal banks may (as in  France) open limited-service branch offices (deposit banking),  arrange financing (investment banking), engage in insurance  operations, and, of course, acquire shares in manufacturing or  insurance companies.    It is no exaggeration to state that the power of Germany's  financial institutions quickly became considerable.    Their heads cornered so many seats on industrial supervisory  boards that a law was passed in 1965 (the Abs Act) limiting the  number of seats that could be held by one person to 10. Today,  banks and insurance companies still account for 10 percent of  the seats on the supervisory boards of the country's 100 biggest  firms. Percentage ownership is not always known, but it exceeds  10 percent in an impressive number of cases (see table below).  Allianz' total portfolio is valued at 185 billion marks [DM]! As  for Deutsche Bank, its stable portfolio is worth DM25 billion,  not including stock in banks.    The English-speaking world, which does not follow this model  (or, rather, did not, since changes appear to be in the making  in the United States), decries this influence on the country's  economy. It sees it as a usurpation of power that is bad for the  small investor and bad for free competition in general. The main  arguments are as follows. Since banks would naturally prefer to  be the ones to distribute credit to companies, they do not  encourage them to turn to the stock market, thereby stunting its  development. Because they are paid in commissions, they do not  encourage corporations to declare large dividends. Because they  can exercise their stockholding customers' voting rights in  general stockholders' meetings, they "hog-tie" the discussions  and decisions. In short, banks are held responsible for  Germany's "hermetically sealed," "opaque" brand of capitalism.  <H5>  More Banal Behavior </H5>   Given that this closure and opaqueness do not appear to have  harmed Germany's postwar recovery (on the contrary!), these  causes for irritation in the English-speaking world were  precisely what some in France, including Jean-Yves Haberer,  admired. Hence the infatuation with the concepts of  "bank-industry" or "bankinsurer-industry."    Today, the internationalization of finance, the  "disintermediation" of the major groups (they have their own  financial resources and need banks less and less), and the  recession, which has triggered a series of serious setbacks, and  compelled reappraisal or at least caution. In France, there has  been much less talk about bank-industry since the resumption of  privatization at breakneck speed and Credit Lyonnais'  difficulties. Without debate or public explanation, French  capitalism is regrouping around the "connivance" model. In  Germany, on the other hand, banks remain loyal to the  bank-industry concept despite some resounding failures: the  collapse of Metallgesellschaft, which cost the lending banks  DM3.4 billion, and the very recent bankruptcy of the Juergen  Schneider real estate development empire.    True, their power over the national economy is gradually  declining as trade barriers come down, they are themselves  tending towards more banal behavior. "Our holdings have tended  to diminish over the past 10 years," Peter Pietsch of  Commerzbank says. However, while ties to big business are  loosening to some extent, this is less true of small and  mid-sized companies--the "Mittelstand" that constitutes the  country's industrial strength. They remain attached to their  Hausbaenke, even if they now call on several institutions for  major transactions. Furthermore, stock ownership is only one of  the tools at the disposal of German universal banks in  maintaining their ties with industry.    "Our policy remains fundamentally unchanged," Peter Pietsch  says. When problems arise, a bank increases its holdings (very  often in conjunction with other banks), as in the case of  Commerzbank's entry into the Karstadt distribution group during  the economic crisis of the 1930's. In the 1970's, Deutsche Bank  took over the Flick family's stock in Daimler-Benz to prevent it  from falling into the hands of the Shah of Iran. Last year it  increased its holdings in Continental Tires to 10 percent to  counter Pirelli's attack. Dresdner Bank and Deutsche Bank will  have to subscribe heavily to the next stock issue of  Metallgesellschaft, which is on the verge of bankruptcy.    Conversely, holdings are sometimes sold. Deutsche Bank and  Commerzbank recently each divested themselves of 15 percent of  Karstadt's stock in order to facilitate the purchase of the  group by its competitor, Kaufhof-Hertie. Deutsche Bank sold its  12.8 percent interest in Suedzucker sugars in order to encourage  restructuring in that sector.    Deutsche Bank's decision to reduce its stake in Daimler-Benz  to under 25 percent is more unusual. Hilmar Kopper, the bank's  head, "no longer wants minority control and does not want to be  seen as having minority control. He wants to reduce his  dependency as a stockholder," he explained to the magazine  EUROMONEY in its January 1994 issue. He emphasizes that a  Hausbank's power can backfire, making it more a "captive" of the  company than vice versa. Hilmar Kopper also wants to trim his  German portfolio and expand his European one. "I consider our  industrial holdings necessary. They are an invaluable part of  our assets," he says. But he wants "different-colored eggs" in  his basket and plans to acquire an interest of "2 to 3 percent"  in various European firms.  <H5>  Superpower </H5>   This policy is currently hampered by the amount of capital  gains taxes that Deutsche Bank will have to pay on the sale of  its investments. For the time being, the German bank officially  owns stock in only one foreign company, Fiat. But from now on it  will tend to become less German and more European.    Will France wake up when Deutsche Bank acquires 3 percent of  Saint-Gobain, for example? Jean-Louis Beffa, the head of the  French group, hopes it will and travels to Frankfurt regularly  to ask Hilmar Kopper to do so. If it does, confronted with what  will appear to be a "German superpower," the French may  rediscover the virtues of bank-industry in a predictable panic.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Major Banks' Principal Holdings (Outside the Banking Sector)(all figures in  |  |percent)                                                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Deutsche Bank                                                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Daimler-Benz (automobile, aeronautics,|24.4                                  |  | electronics)                         |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Philip Holzmann (real estate)         |25.9                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Karstadt (distribution)               |10.0                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Horten (distribution)                 |25.0                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Kloeckner-Humboldt-Deutz (machines)   |38.0                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Linde (mechanical)                    |10.0                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Suedzucker (food)                     |12.8                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Hapag-Lloyd (tourism)                 |10.0                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Continental (tires)                   |10.5                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Metallgesellschaft (metals)           |10.6                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Allianz (insurance)                   |10.0                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Muenchener Rueck                      |10.0                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Dresdner Bank                                                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Bilfinger-Berger (construction and pu-|25.0                                  |  |blic works)                           |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Brau &amp;

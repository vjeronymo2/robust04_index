			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Beith warns 'panic cuts' threaten recovery MR Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, warned yesterday that economic recovery could be endangered by 'panic cuts' to reduce the Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement. He said there was a strong case for 'limited and targeted additional borrowing' to boost capital investment. Delegates overwhelmingly approved a motion calling for the abandonment of the extension of value added tax to domestic fuel. The motion also called for a Budget in which any tax increases were 'fair and progressive'. Like Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, Mr Beith argued that judgment on the necessity of tax rises should be left until nearer the November Budget. He suggested that spending should be increased on construction, housing, public transport and the promotion of energy efficiency. The first signs of recovery could be 'snuffed out' if the government mishandled the massive debt problem it had created, he added. Economic recovery - the only means of getting the deficit down to manageable proportions - would be threatened by cuts in capital spending and family incomes. The warm applause Mr Beith received from some delegates reflected their annoyance at reports that Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, was under pressure to allocate the role of Treasury spokesman to a more glamorous figure. Mr Beith indicated his acceptance of the new emphasis on the need for policies to secure a return to full employment by agreeing to accept an amendment on the role of a central bank. This stipulated that its autonomy in the use of monetary policy to fight inflation must be consistent with a 'wider, democratically set strategy for sustainable growth and economic justice'. The party's commitment to a single European currency - reaffirmed by Mr Beith - was challenged by rank-and-file speakers. Mr Hilary Whittaker from Beckenham, south east London, said it would be premature to establish a timetable for a single currency. Mr Beith acknowledged the difficulties following the disruption of the European exchange rate mechanism, but argued that it would offer the opportunity for low interest rates and more investment and jobs. The route to a single currency envisaged when the Maastricht treaty was negotiated could no longer be seen as the only way forward. Mr Beith said people had to be convinced of the positive merits of a single currency. Monetary union would work in the long run only if people saw it as beneficial. He envisaged the eventual return of sterling to the ERM and urged that when it did so there should be 'a quite short transition period' to a single currency. Mr Beith said 'recent events have made the ERM a very draughty waiting room in which it might not be wise to spend too long once the greater security of a well-insulated single currency is available'.</p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Creditors worry about a quick sell: When an insolvent company's main asset is its staff, receivers are going for a speedy management buy-out When creditors of Corporate Communications, the parent of Charles Barker, the UK's oldest public relations firm, heard that the company had appointed receivers on Thursday July 30 they were shocked. When they heard later that same day that the principal divisions of the company - which owed them Pounds 10m - were to be sold in two buy-outs headed by existing directors, they were livid. They were also powerless. Over the last few years, a new trend has accompanied the growth of 'people businesses' - those companies, in businesses such as advertising and marketing, in which the most valuable assets are the employees. Insolvency practitioners called in as receivers have acted with controversial speed in selling them to the current management. Last month saw the high-speed transition from receivership to sale of subsidiaries of Burns-Anderson, the recruitment and financial services group. Within 48 hours of the receivership, Mr Dorian Marks, the finance director of its recruitment arm, had bought 16 of the 21 recruitment offices on behalf of a new company, Premier Employment. Before that was the case of Babcock Prebon, the financial services company, which called in receivers one Friday afternoon in September 1991. By the early hours of the following Sunday a management buy-out headed by Mr Arthur Hughes, chief executive, was in place. FKB, a large marketing services group, went into receivership in July 1990. Yellowhammer, an advertising agency, followed within a month. In both cases, subsidiaries were sold within a few days. When subsidiaries are sold to the management - as in some, but not all, of these cases - creditors are increasingly starting to complain. They often feel aggrieved that some of the directors running a company at the time - and responsible, therefore, for incurring debts which cannot now be met - are able to make a smooth transition to taking charge of its successor. Mr Jonathan Phillips, an insolvency partner with Price Waterhouse, says: 'What a sale really comes down to is getting the best price available, not looking at the conduct of the directors.' He says it is only later that the role of the directors is closely examined, during the investigations for the compulsory report the receiver must submit to the Department of Trade and Industry on the circumstances surrounding every corporate insolvency. He argues that creditors are more concerned with getting their money back than raking over the directors' involvement in the company's collapse. A more practical question for creditors is whether such speedy sales to existing management close off the possibility of finding alternative buyers who might offer higher prices. After the two management buy-outs from Corporate Communications, a number of other public relations firms said publicly that they would have been interested in purchasing the company. More generally, creditors and potential purchasers often complain that sales have not been widely advertised. But Mr Ian Bond, a partner with Cork Gully who was joint receiver to Corporate Communications, Babcock Prebon and Yellowhammer, stresses the importance of rapid sales which often do not leave time to foster many offers from third parties. 'People businesses fall apart very quickly after a receivership,' he says. 'Speed is essential.' Clients, customers and staff  -anxious not to be tarred by the brush of a bust company or risk losing money - drift away, leaving the receiver with nothing of value to sell. Any time wasted advertising for or seeking out external purchasers could only precipitate this decline, he believes. Very often expressions of interest do not translate into serious offers. There will be delays while companies carry out due diligence, he says. During the summer, with senior executives on holiday, he adds that it is very difficult to get external potential buyers to commit quickly. A third point is how long a delay is acceptable between the decision to appoint receivers and the moment at which creditors are informed. Corporate Communications, for example, has said that it passed a resolution to appoint receivers on July 23. This was one week before most of the creditors were informed. During that period, the two management buy-outs were prepared, with financial backing from Bank of Scotland, its banker, and USF&amp;G, the US insurance group which owned 60.2 per cent of Corporate Communications. Meanwhile, ignorant of the company's imminent receivership, other creditors continued to do business with the company. For example, newspapers - including the Financial Times - continued to accept advertisements from Charles Barker, adding to their exposure to the receivership. Mr Tim Hayward, head of corporate recovery at KPMG Peat Marwick, says that a big creditor will always push for a receiver at the time which suits it best financially. Other creditors inevitably have less power and may suffer as a consequence. Finally, there is the question of whether the bank to a company in receivership should be allowed to support a buy-out - a practice which Mr Bond says is becoming more common. That allows a large existing creditor considerable control over the pace of the receivership, the chance to recover or reschedule substantial debts it is owed and the opportunity to profit from the emergence of the new company. Of course, in people businesses like these - where there are typically no substantial fixed assets - it is likely that only a bank with detailed knowledge of a collapsed company's finances would be willing to put together a buy-out quickly enough to meet the receivers' need for speed. As more and more UK companies generate revenues from intellectual effort rather than physical products, the issue is likely to become a more presing one - and insolvency practitioners handling such cases will have to deal with a steady chorus of grumbling from creditors.</p>

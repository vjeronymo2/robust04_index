			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today, 23 January, the delegates to the Mid-Term  National Party Conference continued to work in the conference  hall. Altogether, 19 delegates contributed their views to the  party Central Committee's political report.    During today's animated and serious debates, the delegates  pointed out the important success of the renovation undertaking  two years following the seventh party congress. The  socioeconomic achievements, which we scored at a time when the  socialist camp has ceased to exist and the former Soviet Union  has collapsed further, testify to our party's clearsighted  leadership and to the correctness of the application of  Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh thought to the specific  conditions in Vietnam. The evaluation results of the political  report are accurate and modest.    Regarding the four menacing dangers, most of the views held  that they are interrelated. They felt no single danger should  be considered the most serious one, and that all dangers must be  traced back to objective and subjective causes. We must take  precautions against them as a result. Some opinions, however,  maintained that one should not call these as dangers, but rather  basic challenges which could obstruct our renovation policy and  national construction and defense efforts. These dangers will  exert a more adverse impact on us if we are not strong enough.    Regarding the key tasks for the days ahead, the delegates  attached much importance to the need to improve our economic  infrastructure, build more industrial bases, and carry out the  industrialization program step by step to benefit key areas of  the country. Priority investment in mountain regions and areas  where difficulties abound is necessary. It is important to pay  due attention to nationalities-related issues and formulate  economic development policies to benefit mountain, border, and  island areas. The delegates discussed mass mobilization and  party building work and maintained that our party has attached  importance to mass mobilization work since the seventh party  congress. Progress has been made in this domain. This is an  important cause leading to recent achievements. Our party  should pay attention to training for cadres in charge of mass  mobilization work and formulate appropriate policies for cadres  in order to develop mass mobilization work a step further.    Regarding party-building work, the delegates maintained that  our party is large in size but is not as strong as it should be.  For the party to be strong enough to direct the entire people  in national construction, measures must be taken to consolidate  grass- roots party organizations, especially party chapters at  villages and city wards. More vigorous efforts are needed to  purify grass-roots party organizations. Deviant and degenerate  party members definitely must be expelled from the party. On  the anti-corruption front, it is necessary to clarify corruption  cases involving party cadres and members as well as take  appropriate action against them. It is important to consider the  possibility of making influential cadres declare their assets.    Regarding culture and art, many delegates also stressed the  need for the party to look after the well-being of cadres in  charge of artistic activities and talented artists of both sexes  so they all can have a sense of security while engaging in  creative work to serve the people. It is necessary to work out  an appropriate pay scale and a long-term training program.    Tomorrow, 24 January, the delegates to the Mid-Term National  Party Conference will continue to work in groups.</p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Japanese outcry at gun attack AN ATTEMPT to shoot a top politician has shaken the Japanese authorities out of their complacency about security just months before a nationwide election campaign, Reuter reports from Tokyo. A young ultra-rightist infiltrated a provincial meeting of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on Friday and fired three shots at the powerful party vice-president, Mr Shin Kanemaru. No-one was hurt, but one bullet flew close to Mr Kanemaru's head. 'I thought wind or an insect was passing by me,' the 77-year-old politician said afterwards. The shooting in Ashikaga, north of Tokyo, has provoked an outcry in Japan, with calls to tighten security around public figures because of the increasing use of firearms. Embarrassed police said that, despite past right-wing threats to Mr Kanemaru, they were not prepared for a gun attack. All their preparation had been aimed at foiling assaults by swords or knives. 'We were caught in a blind spot,' said the national police chief, Mr Ryoichi Suzuki. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, and other government and LDP leaders, including Mr Kanemaru, had been expected to criss-cross the country in the next few months to try to restore their waning political fortunes before elections in late July to replace half of the upper house of parliament. Mr Miyazawa's popularity rating after less than five months in office is languishing at around 20 per cent, amid a series of bribery scandals. Mr Tamisuke Watanuki, the LDP secretary-general, said the party would have to reconsider senior officials' travel plans because police could not guarantee total security. The 24-year-old man arrested after the attack on Mr Kanemaru is a member of a tiny group called Yukoku Seiwa-kai, Patriotic Association for Harmony and Justice. On Saturday, police raided its Tokyo office. Japan's fragmented and relatively small extreme right - about 980 groups with total membership of over 120,000 - is strong on symbolic though noisy protests. The ultra-rightists' main charge against Mr Kanemaru is that he has taken the lead in trying to normalise Japan's long-frozen ties with North Korea.</p>

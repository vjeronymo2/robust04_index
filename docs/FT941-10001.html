			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Governance and the Asians Few doubt that the world economy's centre of gravity is shifting away from the members of the OECD club towards the fast-growing countries of east and south-east Asia. There is also a broad consensus that Europe is a high-cost region which will have to change its ways to adapt to a novel distribution of economic growth. More difficult is to decide which ways have to change. Where corporate governance is concerned, is one model likely to be better than another in coping with the shock of adjusting to the Asian competitive challenge? In an interim report entitled Tomorrow's Company, a team put together by Britain's quaintly named but influential Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) is critical of the Anglo-Saxon tendency to define business success in terms of a single 'bottom line'. While acknowledging the importance of profit, the RSA, which involved 25 of Britain's top companies in the study, seeks a wider definition of business success. It puts a case for a version of the stakeholder approach, which has more in common with the German and Japanese corporate cultures than those of the English-speaking world. Important internal and external relationships such as those with employees, customers and suppliers, as well as investors, are identified as being fundamental to competitive performance. And the report calls for the development of non-financial performance targets, as well as corporate reporting on all stakeholder relationships. Not new While this is not new, it is certainly ahead of current boardroom thinking in much of British industry and commerce. Whether it is right is harder to judge. While it is tempting to identify correlations between successful macro-economic performance and systems of corporate governance, the causality is vague. Nor are styles of corporate governance readily transplanted from one country to another. The strength of the German system of insider corporate control in today's context is that it permits companies to increase expenditure on R&amp;D and employee training when they are undergoing restructuring, while cutting dividends. By contrast, in the Anglo-Saxon system, where outside shareholders have a much less firm commitment to support the company through difficult times, the dividend tends to be sacrosanct whereas investment is not. Implicit contracts between the company and its stakeholders are all too easily broken under the discipline of hostile takeovers. Big changes That said, systems like the German or Japanese, where big changes in corporate direction have to command support or even agreement throughout the organisation, are cumbersome. A successful response to the Asian challenge lies in facilitating rather than postponing structural adjustment. Labour market flexibility is thus a prerequisite. All the signs are that Europe's highest-cost producer, Germany, is struggling to overcome the handicap of labour market rigidities that have contributed to social cohesion in the past, but now inhibit economic growth. Meanwhile, Japan's ability to adjust its employment practices to the requirements of fast-changing economic circumstances appears dependent on the length and depth of its present recession. It is unable to make significant changes without shock treat-ment. The merit of the RSA's approach, in this context, is that it acknowledges the importance of human capital and the need to inspire people to new levels of skill and creativity; also the inability of conventional accounting to capture such things. But a foolproof methodology for measuring non-financial performance may prove elusive. That is a tough test for the final report.</p>

			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / UK Company News: VSEL disappointed over Beverley sale Directors of VSEL, the Cumbrian-based builder of Trident submarines, said they were 'disappointed' and were 'reviewing their position' following the decision by Beverley Group to sell its Gall Thomson (Marine) subsidiary to Villiers, the USM-traded company formerly known as Caspen Oil. Last week Beverley said it had rescinded a previous agreement to sell the offshoot to Sealand Industries, a subsidiary of VSEL. Beverley would be contributing Pounds 40,000 to Sealand's costs.</p>

			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHAW BUSINESS  </P> <P> In the photograph accompanying Brian Peterson's worthy review of "Bernard Shaw  on Photography" (Book Review, Dec. 31), Shaw is pointing his (Leica 35 mm  camera) at a subject but, strangely, looking through the view finder with his  left eye with the finger of his right hand on the shutter button.  </P> <P>  This isn't quite normal unless Shaw's right eye is "better" than his right  eye.  </P> <P> Was Shaw left-handed and possibly posed this way to exhibit more of his face?  Or was the picture "flipped" in printing?  </P> <P> DAVE LIGHT  </P> <P> SAN BERNARDINO  </P></p>

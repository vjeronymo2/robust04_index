			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Cash piles can grow too big for comfort - Peggy Hollinger doubts wisdom of share buy-backs Electricity investors have pocketed more than Pounds 750m over the last 10 months as the regional power companies have rushed to buy back their own shares. The bonanza comes to a temporary halt next week as the last of the 12 regional electricity companies enters its closed period in advance of interim results. This means that neither the company nor its directors may deal in shares until the results are made public. While only nine of the 12 recs have actually bought shares from investors, all have received shareholders' approval to repurchase up to 10 per cent, or more in the case of one company: Eastern, which led the way with the first buy-back in January, has permission to repurchase up to 14.9 per cent. The companies argue that the raft of share buy-backs has been prompted by a desire to return value to shareholders. With the simple act of buying shares for cancellation, the recs are able to improve their earnings. It has been estimated that if all the recs bought back 10 per cent of their equity, the sector's earnings could improve by about 6 per cent. This is a low risk way of enhancing value, say the recs, and of using the rapidly growing cash piles generated by the regulated businesses. In reality, however, the cash mountains are uncomfortable luxuries as the utilities face increasing political pressure to return value not just to shareholders, but also to customers. SG Warburg, the London broker, has estimated that the 12 recs are on their way to building a net Pounds 2.7bn cash mountain by the end of the decade. Such pressures have also increased fears that the electricity companies could become the targets of a one-off tax, either when the National Grid is spun off next year or at a change of government. 'The regional electricity companies have been busily trying to find money to spend to get their balance sheets geared up to such a degree that it will prevent them being stuffed with debt by the government,' said one analyst. Meanwhile, shareholders were not likely to be satisfied with companies sitting on large cash piles at a time of low interest rates. Yet neither would they be happy with widespread diversification, given the poor track record that utilities have outside their core businesses. So the question was, how best to use the cash and return value to shareholders? Paying a special one-off dividend, or even a substantially higher one, could present difficulties. 'You have to be sensitive to the public and political issues,' said one industry executive. 'If you paid a huge increase in dividend, what sort of reaction would that produce?' Repurchases also allow the recs to sidestep the increased dividend problem. Eastern set another trend by increasing its dividend 20 per cent after the first buy-back. Yet because there were fewer shares in issue, the total sum paid out was no greater than the previous year. The other recs are expected to follow Eastern's suit. However, not all the companies agree that buying back shares now is the best way to enhance value for shareholders. Three - East Midlands, Southern and Yorkshire - have chosen not to buy shares. At least two are waiting for the outcome of discussions on the future of the National Grid, the transmission company owned by the recs estimated to be worth at least Pounds 4bn. The manner in which this is spun off could have substantial financial implications for the recs, and for shareholders: for example, in the advance corporation tax burden which the companies will have to carry in case of a distribution to shareholders. There is also the added fear that the companies could face a potential capital gains tax bill of more than Pounds 1bn on a Grid flotation. Until all the facts are known, these companies argue, it is impossible to decide on the best way to return value to shareholders. The abstainers would also argue that some share buy-backs give the greatest benefit to a select group of investors. If the buy-backs are conducted through an agent - as in the case of the two recs who bought 10 per cent - eligible sellers could claim tax credits. While all investors would benefit from improved earnings, only a few could reclaim the credit, estimated at an average 150p a share. Such concerns do not mean that these abstainers will stay out of the market forever. Far from it. 'We have the power to do it and it is just a matter of timing,' said one industry executive.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      THE RECS' SHARE BUY-BACKS 1994  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      Interim     Shares       Price     %       Cost                      Results   bought (m)      (p)*           Pounds m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Eastern              Dec 12       13.5       662.90   5.00      89.5 London               Dec 14       15.3       672.00   7.00     103.2 Midlands              Dec 6       21.2       725.00  10.00     153.4 Manweb               Dec 14        4.1       844.17   3.49      35.0 Norweb                Dec 9       13.5       786.41   7.82     106.2 Northern             Dec 12       12.4       814.60  10.00     100.8 Seeboard              Dec 1       13.6       429.68   5.30      58.4 Swalec               Dec 07        7.1       803.02   6.93      57.0 South Western        Dec 15        6.2       769.00   5.07      49.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- E Midlands, Southern and Yorkshire have not exercised their right to buy shares.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Weighted average  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: SG Warburg  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

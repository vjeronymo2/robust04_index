			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Pharmakopius seeks Stock Exchange listing Pharmakopius, a 10 year-old specialist international healthcare research and development company, is to seek a listing on the London Stock Exchange. The group, which is based near Oxford, undertakes contract research and development work and provides the other services needed before a new drug can be licensed. Its customers include a wide range of pharmaceutical companies. Dr Richard Smith, Pharmakopius' founder, chief executive and main shareholder, said the the flotation will probably be by way of a placing with institutional investors early this year and is likely to value the group at between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m. The issue is being sponsored by Allied Provincial Corporate Services. Dr Smith, a former Reckitt and Colman director of research and development with more than 20 years' experience in the pharmaceutical industry, founded the company in May 1984 as a specialist consultancy. His close adviser is Mr Ronald Wing, a former managing director of Reckitt and Colman. Since then the range of services offered by the group has been expanded to include all aspects of pharmaceutical product development from the end of the discovery process to obtaining product licences - including preparation of the important 'data sheet.' Although turnover has been relatively flat throughout the recession at about Pounds 3.5m the group has continued to trade profitably despite substantial investments, mainly in specialist staff. The group currently employs a core full-time staff of some 75 people, mostly highly qualified scientists. Its client base of more than 150 includes some of the largest international pharmaceutical companies like Bayer, Roche Nicholas, Smith &amp; Nephew and Wellcome. Although it faces competition from the many small contract clinical research companies in the UK and has a few large competitors in the US, Dr Smith claims Pharmakopius is distinct from the the majority of healthcare companies. The company expects to raise between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m in new money through the flotation. The new funds will be used to expand the group's international operations and to further enhance its services to the pharmaceutical industry and strengthen its management team. In addition the funds will be used to exploit the recently-acquired worldwide rights to a broadly based portfolio of prescription and over-the-counter products which are held by its subsidiary, Alpha Healthcare.</p>

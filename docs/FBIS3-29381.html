			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 17 KYODO -- Deputy Foreign Minister  Koichiro Matsuura, a top Japanese negotiator in the trade  "framework" talks with the United States, on Thursday [17  February] suggested holding informal sessions between the two  countries to try to thaw the frozen negotiations.    Matsuura told a luncheon meeting at the Foreign  Correspondents Club of Japan it might be more "productive" to  hold informal meetings than having official discussions under  the spotlight of public attention.    "On our part, we are prepared to get into negotiations  again,  but... We have had conceptual difficulties in defining  'objective criteria'," Matsuura said.    "We have to think hard how we can overcome that conceptual  difference. I hope the American side will also think hard," he  said.    The framework talks, aimed at redressing the bilateral trade  imbalance, broke down last weekend in Washington over U.S.  demands that "objective criteria" such as numerical targets be  set up to gauge foreign access to Japanese markets.    Matsuura said the greatest cause of the failure to come to  full agreement was the different perception of the function of  past bilateral agreements between Japan and the U.S.    The U.S. claimed that the past 30-odd accords between the  two  countries have not fulfilled their objectives, citing the  deteriorating bilateral trade imbalance as proof, he said.    The Japanese argued that many accords have achieved their  initial objectives such as an agreement on NTT procurement and  one on beef imports, and that the bilateral trade imbalance is  not the result of the failure of bilateral agreements but is  caused by macroeconomics, he said.    Matsuura said Japan should hammer out a package of voluntary  actions to deregulate its economy and to take further  market-opening measures.    For example, Tokyo should look more carefully into its  action  program on government procurement announced earlier this month  before the Japan-U.S. summit meeting, and study what additional  elements it could add to it to introduce more competition and  more transparency.    Concerning auto and auto parts, Matsuura said the Japanese  and U.S. Governments should encourage cooperation among private  sectors, saying additional government steps are limited because  it is a highly deregulated area.    Matsuura, who led the Japanese delegation to the framework  talks, said he feels "very depressed" that the six-month long  negotiations failed.    He said at more than one point he felt the Japanese and U.S.  delegations would be able to strike a deal and produce a small  package.    It was a "very, very painful decision" for both sides to  wrap  up the talks without success.    After the luncheon meeting, Matsuura and other senior  officials of the foreign, finance and trade ministries met with  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to discuss further action Japan  should take following the breakdown of the talks.</p>

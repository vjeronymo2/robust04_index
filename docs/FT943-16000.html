			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / International Bonds: Activity dominated by clutch of dollar-denominated issues A clutch of dollar bond offerings dominated market activity yesterday. Two short-dated offerings, for Sweden and Rabobank, were mainly aimed at retail investors. Dealers said the short end of the market was beginning to suffer under the heavy weight of recent supply. The Kingdom of Sweden's Dollars 300m offering of 6 1/4 per cent two-year bonds, via Nomura and Swiss Bank Corporation, met the better reception of the two deals. The issue appeared unaffected by concerns which hit the Swedish government bond market at the end of last week, when Skandia, the Swedish insurance company, said it would boycott government bonds because of concern about the handling of the country's debt problems. The deal was launched at 15 1/2 basis points over the comparable Treasury and, by the end of the day, was bid at 17 basis points over the curve. The deal for Rabobank, despite its triple-A rating and the strong attraction of the name in the Benelux region, is likely to take longer to sell, dealers said. The pricing of 8 basis points over the three-year Treasury yield was considered aggressive. However, lead manager Swiss Bank Corporation pointed out that Rabobank deals launched earlier this year are yielding substantially less than US Treasuries. In the sterling market, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group launched a Pounds 200m offering of three-year floating-rate notes, via UBS. Although there have been a number of floating-rate mortgage-backed securities in the market recently, there has been little bank FRN paper on offer in the sterling market. The deal was priced to offer a discounted margin of 15 basis points over Libor. The bank had considered issuing in dollars, but switched to sterling due to the heavy competition in the dollar sector, with Italy's global due next week. Also in the sterling market, NatWest Capital Markets arranged a repackaging of existing housing association debentures, issued last year in the domestic market. The Pounds 104m issue, for Guaranteed Enhanced Secured Bonds, was guaranteed by Ambac Indemnity Corporation, the US monoline insurer. National Grid has exercised its pre-emption rights to repurchase the two bond issues included in the sale of UK privatised companies' debt by the government, due to take place on July 18, Salomon Brothers announced yesterday. The two bonds are National Grid's Pounds 150m issue of 12.958 per cent bonds due 1997 and its Pounds 150m issue of 11.437 per cent bonds due 2008. Total proceeds to be received by the UK Treasury are Pounds 343.42m.</p>

			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> DRAWING CONCLUSIONS FROM THE LIVES OF RENAISSANCE MEN  </P> <P> As an extension of the J. Paul Getty Museum's energetic collecting of  high-quality manuscripts, Thomas Kren, the museum's young and keen-eyed curator  of medieval manuscripts, has put together a show that samples illuminated  manuscripts and their patrons. "Vie a Mon Desir": Illuminated Manuscripts and  Their Patrons" continues through July 2.  </P> <P> During the Middle Ages, the major patron for illumination was the church and  book illustration was restricted to monasteries and ecclesiastic subjects. As  the renaissance arrived, with all its rich and princely nobles and urban  centers, patronage was extended to include some of the most powerful and elite  names in history. Book execution fell from the hands of monks to premier  artists sought mainly for their skill at illustrating everything from the  standard prayer books to romantic histories to fencing manuals. (A charming one  that outlines moves and combatants in black and white contour lines is included  here.)  </P> <P> The premise behind the show is that these little books present an interesting  way to delve into the social, political and economic goals of patrons. That's a  tremendous load to put on a mere 18 delicately painted pages of parchment,  spectacular as they may be.  </P> <P> But the relationship between the codex and its wealthy sponsor is pretty  obvious: The richer the person, the finer the artisan and the more tour de  force the product. As you might expect, powerful and probably somewhat  egotistic rulers like Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy (whose sponsorship is  sampled in the very fine "History of Charles Martel") had themselves lauded in  their manuscripts either by showing their pious acts, close proximity to  saints, or with their substantial worldly possessions never too far away.  </P> <P> All these subtle and not so subtle prejudices of patron (and sometimes artisan)  seep into these beautiful creations, but ultimately the show doesn't need a  thesis to persuade us that it is an excellent, thoughtfully amassed anthology  of illumination from the 11th to the 16th centuries.  </P> <P> This exhibition scores on its variety of hands and its consistent quality. A  12th-Century New Testament illumination of St. Luke floating in a pure gilt  field and draped in classical robes shows the regional influence of Byzantine  mosaics. A jagged, Gothic-ly rendered St. Hedwig, canonized wife of Henry I,  graces the page of a book ordered by one of the saint's very distant  descendants, who shows himself in knight's armor with his richly attired wife  praying at the foot of their famous relative.  </P> <P> Kren aptly titled the show "Vie a Mon Desir" (Life According to My Desire)  after those words inscribed in a gorgeous book of hours commissioned around  1455 by Simon de Varie, who shows himself not as his hedonistic motto would  imply but in pious prayer before a virtuoso rendition of an approving Madonna  and Child. That these little books served as personal propaganda can't be  denied; that they are exquisite works of art unto themselves can't be argued  either.  </P></p>

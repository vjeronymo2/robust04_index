			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / EC set to agree banking standards Ministers are expected to agree today on Community-wide standards to prevent banks and credit institutions collapsing by lending too much to individual clients, Andrew Hills reports from Brussels. Portugal, which holds the EC presidency, is to put forward a compromise eventually preventing lenders granting loans worth more than 25 per cent of their shareholders' funds to a single borrower. A single loan worth more than 10 per cent of shareholders' funds would have to be cleared with national banking supervisors.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vijya Pushkarna: "Punjab No Model"] </F>   [Text] Can Kashmir be brought around like Punjab was? It  [is] not a question that New Delhi is asking itself, but a hope  it is cherishing. The manner in which it handled the Hazbatbal  crisis and the fact that some people are fed up with militancy  have boosted the government's optimism, though casualties among  the troops are increasing.    But there is little in common between Punjab and Kashmir,  except the gun.    "Equating the two is doing us great injustice," says Prof.  Abdul Gani of the Muslim Conference. "Punjab is an integral part  of India, the Sikh's was a cultural revolt against the Hindus.  Here it is a political problem. We don't say we are Muslims and  so give us certain rights."    This view finds wide support in Srinagar. The people point  to  J&amp;K's [Jammu and Kashmir] disputed status, and the  international  interest in it, which were absent in Punjab's case. And they  bluntly reject any package, economic or political, saying that  they had never demanded concessions of any kind.    There is a host of other differences. Pakistan never claimed  a right on Punjab, though it helped the militants, and the  people of Punjab and Pakistan had nothing in common. Pakistani  infiltration of Punjab was a fraction of what it has been in  J&amp;K. While buses from Lal Chowk have taken boys to Rawalpindi  and Muzzaffarabad, no such buses had gone from Punjab. The  sealing of Punjab border was effective but it is impossible on  the Kashmir border, from where one can trek to Muzzaffarabad  overnight in summer.    The Punjab militant may have been far more deadly than the  Kashmiri but he was backed by no more than 15 percent of the  population. In Kashmir the security forces assess the support to  be 60 percent. Till two years ago, the Kashmiri militant seeking  shelter was given a hero's welcome, completed with a 36-course  wazwan (feast) and there would be nightlong  wunwun (music). The Punjab militant got nothing like  that.    The police sympathise with the militants, the government  officers give them a day's salary every month, and the  politicians have decided to keep out. Even the judiciary is  suspect.    Without the help of the police the security forces can do  little. In Punjab it was J.F. Riberio and K.P.S. Gill who had  called the shots, the security forces were merely assisting  them. In Kashmir the army, BSF [Border Security Force] and CRPF  [Central Reserve Police force] handle the law and order--a task  for which they are not equipped. But they are confident of  ending the problem in less than a year if the police really  start working.    In Punjab the turnaround came when the difference between  criminals and militants disappeared. In Kashmir the militants  have not lost their heroic aura. For fear of agents provocateurs  infiltrating their ranks and dirtying their organisations,  militant leaders like Shabir Shah have ordered a thorough  screening of every recruit. The people who are ready to take on  the militants are just a handful, says a security officer. Some  do it out of grudge, some are fed up with atrocities, some rat  for a consideration.    Punjab was easier terrain. Most showdowns and encounters  were  in the open fields. There was not much chance of innocent  citizens getting caught in the crossfire. In Kashmir, the  militants fire from the windows and the security men are forced  to shoot back at the buildings, harming innocents. "Even when  they come out in the open and fire, they do it from behind a  human shield, often of small children and women. We try not to  harm the people, but if a jawan is killed, the others don't  care," said an officer.    The demographic profiles, too, vary. In Punjab, the Hindus  are only marginally fewer than the Sikhs, but in Kashmir the  Muslims have overwhelming majority. Even Ladakh has 48 percent  Muslims, and Jammu 34 percent. In Punjab, elections could be  held with good Hindu and urban turnout; it preempted criticism  that the government was unrepresentative. Any such effort in  Kashmir will have little success.    Besides, there is the political vacuum. The politicians are  reluctant even to visit the valley. In Punjab, at least a few  parties carried on their campaign and shaped the public opinion.  The CPI [Communist Party of India], the Congress and the BJP  [Bharatiya Janata Party] paid a heavy price, but remained  staunchly anti-terrorist.    Kashmir requires a different touch. Right now, no solution  is  possible without the involvement of the Huriyat Conference or  some of its constituents. Hurried elections may only deepen the  mire in a place where rigging has fuelled the fury.    Governor K.V. Krishna Rao has been trying to push the  politicians into the valley. "They have been making all kinds of  excuses, out of fear," he says. Gulam Nabi Shaheen, the Srinagar  block president of the National Conference who lives in Jammu,  believes that his party can play a mediatory role. But "for a  political process to be successful, it is imperative that the  government talks to Shabir Shah, Yaseen Malik and others. First,  the guns have to be silenced, and all detainees released  unconditionally," he says. "Elections now will achieve nothing."    Ali Mohammad Sagar, minister in Farooq's cabinet, too, lives  in Jammu. "At least 20 ex-MLAs [members of Legislative Assembly]  have been killed," says Sagar who believes that bringing Farooq  will not help. "Listen to people like Shabir Shah," he tells the  government. "Many militant leaders are seasoned, educated,  qualified and have a following. There are those who abhor the  gun culture. If Laldenga and Prafulla Mahanta can be won over,  why not these people? Don't make it a prestige issue, take a  humane view."    Others too want Shabir Shah and Yaseen Malik to be won over,  though they don't say it in so many words. Veteran Congressman  Sardar Rangeel Singh, who was in the cabinet of Syed Mir Qasim  and Sheikh Abdullah, says "the old leadership has become  redundant" and former party general secretary Mangat Ram Sharma  is for harnessing Muslim nationalist forces.    Says BJP leader Chaman Lal Gupta: "If we eliminate the gun  and hold elections, leaders will be thrown up. If Shabir Shah  and Yaseen Malik are elected to power under the Constitution of  India, we should accept it. But it has to be a very fair and  free election."    Members of the Huriyat pooh-pooh the talk of political  process. "Any political process will have to be in a country  outside India and Pakistan, with international guarantees,"  says Javied Ahmed Mir, acting chief of the Jammu Kashmir  Liberation Front. Prof. Gani calls it a political prattle since  a political process that does not address the basic issue of the  dispute will serve no purpose.    According to Mian Abdul Quayoom, another member of the  Huriyat, the only acceptable process involves demilitarisation  of the region. UN trusteeship of it for five years, election of  an interim government, and self-determination by the people.  Huriyat chairman Mirwaiz Maulvi Umar Farooq too rejects a  political process and Shabir Shah himself calls it nonsense.    Interestingly, there are people who assert that Farooq  Abdullah is the de facto chief of the JKLF [Kammu Kashmir  Liberation Front] and that it will do what he wants. Says  Mushtaq Ahmed Lone, former National Conference MLA: "Dr Farooq  Abdullah is a founder of the JKLF movement." The JKLF, however,  has dismissed it as a canard.    Is Dr Abdullah, who recently paid a visit to Kashmir, still  relevant otherwise? To New Delhi, he, being a nationalist, is a  trump card to be played at international fora. Besides, people  over 45 still have a sympathy for his party. And as Mangat Ram  Sharma says he is a bird in hand and is better than two in the  bush.    Whatever it be, most people believe that 1994 cannot be the  election year in the valley. "Give me the choice between my job  and being a returning officer, and I will quit," says a  bureaucrat. Even the security forces say no elections will be  possible in the very near future. "The people are too petrified  to go to the polls," says an officer.    All the same, New Delhi may not depend on the advice of the  security forces, partly because it feels that they have  developed vested interests in militancy--even though it does not  give credence to allegations that border tracts are put to  auction for collecting fabulous sums offered by the militants as  bribes to let them cross the border. Besides, with mounting  international pressure, India may have to force certain things,  as Home Minister S.B. Chavan has put it.  <H5>  ABDUL GANI: MUSLIM CONFERENCE </H5>   The 56-year-old professor of Persian was dismissed from  government service in 1986, on the grounds that he was a  potential threat to the security of the country. "A professor is  a professor. He enjoys the academic freedom to talk, to express  himself sufficiently on any subject," he says.    "In that capacity, I called a spade a spade. I considered  all  along that the Kashmir dispute would not only bring untold  misery to the people of the state but also lead to wars between  India and Pakistan. You can keep the people against their wishes  for a time, not all time. That's a lesson I learnt from history.  "The professor is unequivocal about his preference: accession to  Pakistan.  <H5>  MD ASHRAF SAHRAI: JAMAIT ISLAMIA </H5>   The Jamait Islamia of J&amp;K may not be the biggest  political  party or constituent of the Huriyat Conference, but its power  lies in the fact that its military wing, the Hizbul Mujahdeen,  is the most dreaded outfit, with a cadre whose fire power is  matched by its motivation. Though the Islamia talks about the  Kashmiris' right to self-determination, it is in favour of  Kashmir's merger with Pakistan.    That is why Mohammad Ashraf Sahrai, general secretary of the  Islamia, has been attracting attention. "The only political  parties in the war zone," he says, "are the Jamait Islamia and  the Awami Action Committee." Incidentally, Sahrai is proud of  protecting temples in Kupwara from an angry procession.  *</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HEALTH;  </P> <P> AMA OKS FRENCH ABORTION PILL  </P> <P> The controversial French abortion pill has won backing from the American  Medical Assn., the nation's largest doctors' association.  </P> <P> In a voice vote Wednesday, the AMA's 436-member policy-making House of  Delegates endorsed testing and possible use of the RU-486 abortion pill.  </P> <P> "The abortion issue, pro and con, should not interfere with our ability to  conduct all kinds of investigations for all kinds of problems," said Dr.  Charles Sherman, chairman of the AMA committee that recommended support for the  pill.  </P> <P> The pill is not available in the United States, and no U.S. companies have  applied for Food and Drug Administration approval to market it in this country  because, doctors say, they fear running afoul of the anti-abortion movement.  </P> <P> Some doctors in the AMA said the pill appears safer and cheaper than surgical  abortion and may be useful in treating brain tumors, breast cancer and other  illnesses.  </P></p>

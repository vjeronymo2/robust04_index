The announcement came after 25 hours of non-stop  negotiations  on the terms for taking Sweden, along with Austria, Finland and  Norway, into the Union on January 1, 1995.    Sweden was pushing for a gradual phase-in of its  contributions to the EU budget.    The year-old negotiations were supposed to have been wrapped  up at midnight Monday after a final four-day session that  started on Friday.</p>

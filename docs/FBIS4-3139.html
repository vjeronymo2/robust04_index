			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] A government source quoting intelligence report  said that a group of renegade Mainland Chinese soldiers murdered  24 Taiwan tourists who died in a mysterious boat fire in  Mainland China last month.    The source told REUTER a number of People's Liberation Army  soldiers, armed with flame-throwers, robbed and burned to death  the tourists and eight Mainland Chinese crew of the boat on  Chientao [Qiandao] Lake in the Province of Chekiang [Zhejiang]  on 31 March.    Mainland Chinese authorities found out about the murders the  next day but decided to cover them up and ordered the loot to be  returned because the impact of the incident could be  far-reaching, the source claimed, quoting intelligence which has  been described as authoritative.    The deaths of the tourists under mysterious circumstances  have strained uneasy relations between Taiwan and Mainland  China. Relatives of the victims have accused Mainland China of  covering up what they alleged to be mass murder. Mainland China  acknowledged last week that the blaze might have been caused by  saboteurs. It pledged that the culprits would be severely  punished.</p>

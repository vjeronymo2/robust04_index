			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> The Grammy Awards show will stay at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles for  another year rather than return to New York, largely due to Los Angeles'  "stellar" efforts as the host of this year's show, the head of the  Grammy-sponsoring National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences said Monday.  The Grammys were moved from Los Angeles to New York in 1988, and it had been  expected that the show would alternate between the two show-business capitals.  "It was a big hit," NARAS President Michael Green said of the work done by  Mayor Tom Bradley's official host committee. He noted the showcasing of  different music styles in local clubs and the "Grammy in the Schools" program  that sent professional musicians to visit city schools. "Los Angeles did a  great job, so we're rewarding them and ourselves by coming back," Green said.  As for New York, the Big Apple will host a nationally televised NARAS event in  November and will have another shot at winning the Grammy show for 1991. ALEENE  MacMINN  </P></p>

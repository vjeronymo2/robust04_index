			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Technology: In tune on the motorway - Worth Watching Every driver knows how dangerous it can be to try to tune in the car radio while driving. German manufacturer Blaupunkt has launched a car radio which could eliminate the problem by displaying all the required information on a colour liquid crystal display screen which sits near the top of the dashboard. As well as displaying the name of the station to which the radio is tuned, it lists all the stations available, which can be selected using a cursor. The unit can also be attached to a CD player or a navigation system, so that it can display textual data or diagramatic route information. Blaupunkt: Germany, 51 21 49 46 12.</p>

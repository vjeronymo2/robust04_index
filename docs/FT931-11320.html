			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Amnesty warning on racist violence BLACKS, Arabs and Asians are suffering racist violence in western Europe at the hands of the very security forces who should be protecting them, Amnesty International says in a report released today, Reuter reports from London. The human rights group says police across the continent have taken part in bloody racist attacks and treated ethnic minorities in a degrading manner. 'We know of people being badly beaten up, a 14-year-old asylum seeker having his arm broken, a motorcyclist being run down by a car and then beaten up by the driver - all assaulted not by racist organisations but by police officers,' the report says. Amnesty says it is 'pitifully rare' for police officers to be brought to justice for such behaviour. It urges governments to take firm action against torture or ill-treatment by police and other security forces. It recommends pre-employment screening of police officers for racist attitudes and dismissal where appropriate for those who persist in racial discrimination. Amnesty cites cases in nine European countries, including Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Austria and Denmark. In Austria, Amnesty names a man of Egyptian descent who was singled out by police for jay-walking within a group of European pedestrians. When the man refused to pay a fine he was subjected to racial abuse by the officers, beaten up and pushed through a window while in custody. No police officers have been prosecuted. In Italy, a Somali asylum-seeker was rushed to hospital last year after being beaten unconscious in police custody, Amnesty says. 'In the present climate, with racial attacks on the increase and racist groups growing in size . . . failure to act is tantamount to condoning racist crimes in society at large,' Amnesty says.</p>

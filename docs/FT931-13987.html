			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Don't worry about IBM 'THINK]' said the signs that hung in every IBM office in the company's glory days. Those notices have long gone, but the exhortation lingers. IBM's decline offers food for thought. Yesterday's quarterly operating loss, the first in the company's history, is disappointing news for IBM's shareholders and employees. It is not, however, a cause for more general dismay. Rather, it marks a moment of transition in the industry, when leadership passes to the companies that came of age with the microprocessor. When IBM had four-fifths of the market for computers in the 1960s and 1970s, it shaped the way the industry developed. Now that task has fallen to Intel and Microsoft, suppliers of the chips and the software which process an increasing proportion of the world's data. Along with IBM's mantle of leadership, both have inherited the resentment of the less successful. Their new dominance has led to a chorus of grumbling and - in Microsoft's case - complaints to the US competition authorities. From the point of view of the industry's customers, however, the shift away from an industry dominated by a single company has been beneficial. Though IBM's greatest success came in the last third of the 20th century, its roots go back a hundred years to Herman Hollerith's punched cards and the salesmen's school at National Cash Register. That inheritance gave IBM a visceral commitment to proprietary technology and a strong belief in 'account control', obtained through a hugely expensive network of sales and support staff. Today's management, as it wrestles with costs, is struggling as much with the legacy of IBM's past sales techniques as with the transformation of technology. High costs By itself, though, the change in technology would have been enough to undermine IBM's position. The mass production of standard microprocessors and standard software - a trend which IBM itself did much to foster in the personal computer sector - has created an industry open to all comers. In such a world, the high costs of IBM's structure is a damaging competitive disadvantage. The new computer industry is based on standard building blocks of hardware and software. Standardisation has enormous cost advantages for customers. Not only is it much easier to assemble equipment from competing suppliers; it is also much cheaper to train staff to use industry standard programs. Outside suppliers Such advantages aside, the transformed industry exemplifies some wider economic trends. It exploits the global division of labour to harness together Asian manufacturing skills and American inventiveness. IBM exemplified the economies of scale of the large, integrated corporation. If it is suffering now, it is doing so partly because the advantage of that approach has lessened. Many of the services which could previously only be supplied by dedicated specialist departments inside a large company can now be supplied by outsiders. Distribution, system software, application software, systems integration - all the elements of the IBM model are now available from other, often more competitive, suppliers. The computer industry is not alone in facing this dilemma: many other industries are increasingly having to face a future in which they must decide which of their activities are central, to be defended at all costs, and which can be better done by external suppliers. The solution at IBM, as at other large companies faced with similar threats, is to set each of its divisions free to compete with their external rivals. It is an open question, however, whether each individual division can win its own battle; and whether the sum of these individual confrontations will lead to victory overall. For the computer industry's customers, the struggle now taking place at IBM is fascinating but of much less significance to them than it might have been only a decade ago. Technological and market leadership is now largely centred elsewhere. A world in which IBM is losing money may seem a strange one to anyone brought up on the business history of the 20th century; but it has its compensations.</p>

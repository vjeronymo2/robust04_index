			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Canal unites great rivers of Europe: The North Sea and Black Sea are linked amid trade hopes and environmental fears TODAY an age-old European dream is to become a reality: a canal is to open which will link the Rhine and Main rivers in the north of Europe to the Danube in the south - thus connecting the North Sea and the Black Sea. This was a dream of Charlemagne 1,200 years ago, and of subsequent Holy Roman Emperors. With an appropriate sense of occasion, the opening will be celebrated in grand style - but not without a note of discord. For as some 2,000 guests assemble this morning in the Nuremberg Meistersingers Hall for a musical celebration, the Bavarian Green Party is hoping to field a demonstration of several hundred opponents on the square outside. And as the guests float down the canal later in the day in a flotilla of boats to celebrate the formal opening in the presence of German President Richard von Weizsacker and Mr Gunter Krause, the federal transport minister, the aggrieved Greens will be following a similar route in their mini-buses, with the view of staging a second demonstration later in the day. Fans of the project, among the most prominent of whom is Bavarian President Max Streibl, who will be hosting today's proceedings, say that the 171km stretch of canal from Bamberg to Kelheim will do more than provide an impetus to Bavaria's economy. They talk in grand terms about a waterway, twice as long as the Panama canal and longer than Suez, which will bring east and west closer together in troubled times for Europe. It has taken more than 30 years to build, at a cost of over DM6bn (Pounds 2.3bn). Building work was halted during Mr Helmut Schmidt's time as chancellor, on the basis that the project was woefully uneconomic, and revived again only after Mr Helmut Kohl came to power in 1982. 'A monument to godlessness,' is how one Bavarian pastor described the project this week. Another critic, Mr Christian Magerl, Green party spokesman on the environment in the Bavarian parliament, says that the canal is a 'pure prestige object'. He objects to the canal first on environmental grounds: it runs through what used to be unspoilt countryside and it will alter the water-table, to the detriment of Bavaria's flora and fauna. Second, he believes that the canal is economic nonsense. 'It will compete with the train system and not the Autobahns, which is stupid,' he says. 'And the canal operators' expectations of 10m tonnes of cargo every year are hopelessly ambitious.' Mr Magerl believes that cargo will amount to no more than 3m tonnes a year - a level at which the project will not even cover its running costs, he says. While a wondrous thing, the new waterway is by no means as smooth and simple as, say, the Rhine. For one thing, there are 59 locks on the Main and in the canal, slowing traffic considerably. Also, the Danube flows faster than the Rhine. A voyage from Linz to Rotterdam will probably take 10 or 11 days compared with a guaranteed 42 hours by rail. There are stretches of the Danube - in Germany below Regensburg, in Austria above Vienna in the Wachau and along the Slovakian-Hungarian border - where the water is occasionally too shallow for navigation. This rules out the establishment of regular liner services and the use of the waterway for just-in-time deliveries. Clearances beneath some bridges on the Danube are so low that containers can only be piled two-high. Rhine operators feel they need to pile containers four-high to be profitable, and they are plying a much shorter, more densely populated stretch of water than the Danube. Similarly, long strings of barges can be put together on the Rhine, but not on the twisting Main or through the new canal locks. If these obstacles ensure that the amount of traffic going all the way from Rotterdam to Romania will be limited, the canal seems certain to provide a boost to Austro-German trade. The Austrians estimate that nearly half of the traffic on the canal will be related to their country - either raw materials coming from Rotterdam to the big steel and chemical plants at Linz or industrial components and semi-finished products moving up to German factories from Austria for final assembly. Austrian officials expect the build-up of traffic on the waterway to be gradual and to depend on a number of factors, such as reliability and how the railways react to this new competition. Hungary also hopes that the canal will boost trade with Germany, already the country's largest trading partner. The Transport Ministry estimates that traffic in Hungarian goods on the Danube, currently about 1.5-2m tonnes, will rise by up to threefold. As a condition, Hungary is pressing ahead with port renovation and an entirely new facility at Gyor in the west of the country. Hungary also sees the canal as insurance that the country will still be able to import oil from Rotterdam even if the pipeline through the former Soviet Union as well as that through Yugoslavia is cut off. Meanwhile at Constanta, the ancient Black Sea port where the poet Ovid spent his last days in miserable exile, the cranes stand idle. Hopes are high in Romania that the opening of the canal will revive the port, which handled only 28m tonnes of cargo last year, less than half 1989 levels, and strengthen the country's ties with the west. Although Nicolae Ceausescu, the country's former dictator, spent more than Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.9bn) in the hope of making Constanta the world's third largest port, and personally oversaw the building of a 65km canal to link it to the Danube, the port still needs investment of some Dollars 200m to be completed. Worse, trade has fallen victim to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, with the United Nations embargo on trade with Serbia likely to cost Romania Dollars 3bn this year alone. The only shipping now passing through Constanta on to the Danube each week is two or three convoys of barges carrying raw materials to Romanian ports such as Galati, the steel town.

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Survey of West Bengal (5): Packets may mean profits - Darjeeling tea The billboard in front of the tea factory of Puttabong Tukvar estate in the Darjeeling hills boldly proclaims: 'None before us'. Mr SM Kumbat, vice- president, explains that tea growing in Darjeeling began at Puttabong in 1852 with bushes brought from China. The 22km-long Puttabong estate, starting at an altitude of 1,000 ft and ending at 7,000 ft, grows some of the finest and more expensive teas in the world. Last year Puttabong created a world trade sensation when it sold 120kg of 'antique tea' to a German buyer at Rs10,001 a kg. 'The entire quantity of antique tea was hand-made. At no stage of plucking, withering, rolling and drying of tea leaves were machines used. We unearthed the old records and spoke to very old planters to find out exactly how tea was made here over a century ago,' says Mr Kumbat. Since then, Castleton, a tea estate owned by Goodricke, has sold some lines of Darjeeling tea at even higher prices. 'Hand-made tea, which only a few gardens produce, is targeted at the very famous and the very rich in Germany and Japan. This exclusive tea apart, the gardens at Darjeeling in general get fairly good prices for the tea produced from March to June. Production during this period, amounting to about 35 per cent of the hills' total output in a year, is almost fully exported,' says Mr Mumtaz Ahmad, who represents the Indian tea industry. There is, however, a perceptible fall in the quality of tea produced between July and November. It is because of this that the marketing of the major portion of Darjeeling tea poses such a big challenge. The disintegration of the Soviet Union, which was a big buyer of this late Darjeeling tea, has made matters worse for the industry. According to Mr Ahmad, domestic demand for Darjeeling tea is insignificant. The industry fails to dispose of 65 per cent of its production at remunerative prices. But Mr Ahmad believes its marketing problem can be overcome if the region's major producers form a consortium to promote and market Darjeeling tea - in packets - within India. 'It is not within the capacity of any single producer to undertake this task. But once the consortium has established itself in the country, it can start taking export initiatives.' Surprisingly, there are few takers of the consortium proposal within the industry. No doubt, the world's finest tea is produced in the hills of Darjeeling. The hill soil condition, high altitude and mist give Darjeeling tea a 'muscatel' flavour. However, the region's production of tea has been stagnating at around 13m kg. And the cost of producing tea in Darjeeling is far higher than in the plains of West Bengal and Assam. According to Mr SN Somani, president of Jay Shree Tea, which owns three large tea estates in Darjeeling, the age of many of the tea bushes, the difficult topography and low labour productivity are responsible for the low yield of about 650kg of tea a hectare in the region, compared with over 1,800kg a hectare at Dooars in West Bengal. Yet 'it would be suicidal for the industry to chase quantity at the cost of quality since quality happens to be the unique selling point of Darjeeling tea,' says Mr D Atal, spokesman for the Darjeeling Planters Association. There is an industry consensus that research must be encouraged if the stagnation in Darjeeling's tea yield is to be broken. The Indian Tea Board and DPA have jointly prepared a plan for upgrading the Darjeeling Tea Research Centre. The industry will expect the DTRC to suggest measures to arrest soil erosion, especially when old tea bushes are uprooted to make room for replantation, and to develop high-yielding clones for different altitudes of Darjeeling hills. In spite of their ageing bushes, the Darjeeling tea estates are going about the job of replantation slowly. They must first ensure that the uprooting of tea bushes will not result in landslides, according to Mr Atal. If there is to be any significant increase in the production of Darjeeling tea, then the West Bengal government must allow the gardens to grow tea 'in their contiguous areas which are now remaining unutilised.' The government must also return land to the gardens which it earlier acquired from them as surplus. Unfortunately, progress in this direction is slow. Not very long ago, more than 40m kg of tea was marketed globally as Darjeeling tea, even though production in Darjeeling hills would not be more than 13m kg. All sorts of teas would be passed off as Darjeeling, giving the tea a bad name. This menace has been stopped to a great extent, partly because a Tea Board logo is now used only on packets containing Darjeeling tea.</p>

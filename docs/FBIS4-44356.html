			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/94/1: "European Council at Corfu -- </F> 24/25 June 1994 Presidency Conclusions"; as released on 28 June]    [Text]  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   The signature at Corfu of the treaty on accession and the  participation of the heads of state or government from Austria,  Sweden, Finland and Norway in the work of the European Council  constitute an important new landmark in the history of European  integration.    The acceding countries will be joining a European Union  faced  with rapid development after the entry into force of the treaty  on European Union and with multiple demands addressed to it to  play an ever increasing role in promoting security and  prosperity on our continent and beyond. The preparatory process  is soon to be launched for a new intergovernmental conference  with a view to making the European Union better able to confront  the challenges of the 21st century, including those arising from  enlargement of the Union to the east and to the south.    The Austrian people have already confirmed their  government's  wish to participate in this unique endeavour, where independent  and sovereign states decide freely to exercise in common some of  their competences, in full respect of each country's history,  culture and traditions. The European Council hopes that the  decision of the population in the other candidate countries will  be the same.    The new Member States will be in a position to make their  influence felt in these endeavours, both with regard to  day-to-day policy and on the long term strategic choices to be  made. The European Council welcomes in this connection the  additional impetus coming from these countries which are in the  vanguard of the efforts to promote environmental and social  protection, transparency and open government, areas considered  essential by a large part of the Union's citizens during the  recent election campaign for the European Parliament and echoed  by the President of the parliament in his intervention before  the European Council.    The European Council on its side stresses that openness and  subsidiarity are essential concepts which require further  elaboration. The Union must be built with the support of its  citizens.    The European elections have also underlined that the Union  will be judged by its citizens on the contribution it makes in  the fight against unemployment and in the promotion of the  internal and external security of the Union.    The signature of the partnership and co-operation agreement  with Russia at the occasion of the European Council at Corfu  marks an important event in the efforts to promote peace,  stability and prosperity on this continent. Through this  agreement Russia and the European Union, both of which have  major responsibilities in these areas, will be able to intensify  their co-operation in a large number of fields of mutual benefit  to their peoples.    The past six months have seen the implementation of the new  institutional provisions of the treaty on European Union,  including the establishment of the committee of the regions.  From now on this committee will make certain that the interests  of the regions are fully taken into account in the decision  making procedure of the Union.    The European Council heard a statement from the President of  the European Parliament on the main subjects dealt with by the  European Council and on the necessity of constructive  co-operation between the institutions and in particular between  the council and the parliament. Like Mr Klepsch the European  Council welcomed the progress made in this direction in the  implementation of the new procedures of the treaty.  <H5>  I. White Paper </H5>   In December 1993 the European Council in Brussels adopted a  plan of action based on the commission white paper on a  medium-term strategy for growth, competitiveness and employment.  It underlined that a healthy and an open economy as well as an  economy geared to solidarity were essential prerequisites for  the successful implementation of this plan.    Signs of economic recovery are now being confirmed and  non-inflationary economic growth is returning. The European  Council considers it essential that the improvement in the  economic situation should not lead to a slackening of efforts to  promote structural adjustment in Europe but should instead be  exploited to speed up essential reforms, particularly in the  field of employment, where the situation is still very worrying.    The successful conclusion of the Uruguay round within the  guidelines set out by the European Council has created an  international trade policy environment which can provide  effective support for economic recovery and job creation. The  European Council calls on the community institutions and Member  States to do everything necessary to complete ratification in  time to ensure the entry into force before 1 January 1995. The  European Union will play an active role in efforts to ensure  that the new world trade organization can carry out effectively  its task of ensuring observance of the rules drawn up jointly  and promote progress in combatting unfair trade conditions.  Environmental and social issues will also have to be discussed  in this context.    The European Council on the basis of a report from the  President of the Commission had an in depth discussion on the  different elements of the action plan decided in the Brussels  European Council.    The European Council puts particular emphasis on the  following points which should give new impetus in the follow-up  debate on the White Paper.    I. Encouragement of reforms in Member States intended to  improve the efficiency of the systems of employment.    II. Specific measures with regard to fully exploiting the  employment potential of small- and medium-sized enterprises.    III Reinforced coordination of research policy.    IV. Rapid implementation of high priority transeuropean  projects in the field of transport and energy.    V. Fully exploiting the possibilities and opportunities  offered by the information society.    VI. encouragement of the new model of sustainable  development including the environmental dimension.  <H5>  1. Improving the Employment Situation </H5>   A sound macroeconomic environment is a sine qua non for  success in the fight against unemployment (see point 5).    The resumption of economic growth will not of itself suffice  to settle the problem of unemployment, which requires structural  reforms both at the level of Member States and of the Union.    The European Council considers that increases in  productivity  for the rest of this century should be dedicated primarily to  investments and jobs. This objective should be implemented in a  spirit of solidarity and taking special account of those in  society who are in the weakest position. The European Council  stresses the need to maximize the potential of human resources.    The European Council reviewed on the basis of a report from  the Commission the initiatives under way in the member states in  accordance with the general objectives defined in December 1993.  The European Council noted progress in these areas but  considered that the efforts undertaken so far, though  appreciable, still fall a long way short of what is necessary.  It encourages Member States in order to win the battle for jobs  to take further steps to implement the objectives set out in  December. In particular:     -  With regard to education and  training, the European Council concurs with the Commission's  recommendation that a more systematic and comprehensive approach  will be needed in many Member States in particular with regard  to continuing training. At the Community level the European  Council welcomes the agreement in principle by the Council on  the two new education and training programmes (Leonardo and  Socrates) and invites the Council and the European Parliament to  finalize the decisions on this programme before the end of the  year.    -  As regards measures to encourage employment, the European  Council notes the Commission recommendation concerning the  reduction of non wage labour costs, mainly on the less skilled.  In this framework, the European Council underlines that further  steps should be pursued, consistent with the objective of  budgetary consolidation.     Accordingly, the European Council takes note of the  discussion on the CO[.sub]2[/] energy tax issues and  underlines the need to ensure that environmental costs are  better reflected throughout the economy. As regards the  promotion of economically sound formulas for the organization of  work, the European Council notes the need to remove obstacles to  part-time work and in general to promote new forms of  organization of work.%With regard to developing new employment  in connection with meeting new requirements linked to the  quality of life and protection of the environment, the European  Council notes that a number of initiatives have been taken but  many of the new areas of job growth that were identified in the  White Paper remain to be exploited. The European Council  underlines the importance of the study to be prepared by the  Commission before the next European Council on this  subject.%With regard to young people, the European Council  considers that additional emphasis should be given to those  young people who are facing the greatest difficulties. It  attaches high importance to ensuring as far as possible that  young people can move from education into work; in this context  it welcomes the Commission's youth start programme.    To support these efforts the European Council invites the  Social Affairs Council, the ECOFIN council and the Commission,  on the basis of information collected by the Commission, to keep  progress in this area under constant review. The Council will  report to the European Council in essen on national experiences  which have had positive effects on employment, analyzing the  reasons for their success, and define appropriate policy  recommendations for adapting current policies.    Efforts to promote youth employment and to combat long term  unemployment should be given particular priority in the work of  the Council.    Finally the European Council invites the Commission to renew  its efforts towards assuring the necessary social dialogue  making full use of the new possibilities available in the treaty  on European Union and in particular of the provisions of the  protocol annexed to it.  <H5>  2. The Internal Market, Competitiveness and Small- and </H5> Medium- Sized Enterprises [SMEs]    The smooth operation of the internal market is essential if  the economy is to be competitive and dynamic. This means that  the delays in transposing certain important directives on public  contracts, insurance, intellectual property and company law at  national level must be remedied. Furthermore, it is essential  that the basic principles of the single market should be  extended to those areas, such as energy and telecommunications,  which are still only partly covered by it while ensuring that  the public service and town and country requirements in these  sectors are also safeguarded.    The single market is implemented with due regard to  environmental problems. The safeguard of important national  environmental protection measures shall be secured in this  context.    The single market is a fundamental aspect of community  construction but it is not an end in itself, as was already  pointed out in the conclusions of the Rhodes European Council in  1988. It should be used to serve the welfare of all, in  accordance with the tradition of social progress established in  the history of Europe. the policy of the Union, alongside the  policies of the Member States, should foster the affirmation of  this social dimension. In the view of the Member States  concerned, the recent agreement in the Council under the  provisions of the social protocol concerning information and  consultation of workers in multinational enterprises constitutes  significant progress towards the realisation of this objective.  Further advances on the same basis, including efforts aimed at  avoiding social exclusion, are essential in a society in rapid  transformation. The European Council also welcomed the recent  agreements in the Council on the protection of young workers as  well as the creation of the agency for health and safety at work.    Small- and medium-sized enterprises make a major  contribution  to growth and job creation and they should be able to benefit  more from all the opportunities offered by the single market.  The European Council welcomed the implementation by the Council  of its orientations concerning interest rate subsidies for SME's  and that the Commission has decided to devote ECU1 billion for  the period 1994-1999 for a community initiative programme to  help small- and medium-sized enterprises adapt to the internal  market and to the new competitive environment. It also noted  with interest the recent Commission initiative for an integrated  programme in favour of small- and medium-sized enterprises,  including action to simplify legislation and reduce  administrative burdens on such enterprises, and the initiative  of the Portuguese Prime Minister on the local dimension of the  internal market and the initiatives taken by Ireland in the  areas of social partnership and local development. The European  Council considers that local development initiatives offer  considerable potential for reinforcing the economic and social  fabric of the European Union and for creating jobs. They are an  essential element of the new model of development mentioned in  the White Paper and will help to preserve cultural diversity  within the Union. The European Council notes the Commission's  intention, within the framework of the report on new potential  sources of employment to be submitted to the European Council in  Essen, to draw up a detailed inventory of the various actions at  community level to foster local development and local employment  initiatives, particularly those concerning micro-entreprises and  handicraft industries. This inventory will be accompanied by  the proposals deemed necessary to enhance the consistency and  the effectiveness of those actions.    Regarding scientific and technological research, the  European Council expects that the recent decision on the  ambitious 1994-1999 framework programme, to which considerable  funding has been allocated, will be followed up without delay by  the rapid adoption of specific sector programmes. In this  context the information sector and biotechnology are of  particular importance. It also invites the Council to pursue a  more systematic coordination of community and national research  policies and invites the Commission to take any useful  initiatives to promote such coordination.    Lastly, the European Council expressed its conviction that  the elimination of unnecessary legal and administrative burdens  on business and making community and national legislation  simpler are important aspects of improving the competitiveness  of the European Economy. It welcomes the fact that the  Commission is pursuing its efforts to simplify existing  community legislation and will reinforce its cost/benefit  examination of proposed community legislation. The Commission  also intends to launch a process of examining the impact of  existing community and national legislation on employment and  competitiveness. With regard to these latter aspects the  European Council welcomes the establishment by the Commission of  a group composed of independent personalities to assist it in  this task and attaches high importance to its work.    As regards subsidiarity the Council welcomes the progress so  far made by the Commission in acting on the report of December  1993 and notes the Commission's undertaking to give a full  report to Essen.  <H5>  3. Transeuropean Networks for Transport, Energy and </H5> Environmental Projects    The single market will produce all the expected positive  effects to benefit citizens and firms only if it can rely on  effective transeuropean networks for transport and energy. The  European Council welcomed the work achieved so far by the group  chaired by Mr Christophersen in accordance with the mandate  given last December.    On the basis of the group's report, the European Council has  agreed on a first priority list of 11 major transport projects,  set out in Annex i. As far as the energy sector is concerned  the European Council took note of the projects listed in Annex  ii and requested the Christophersen group to continue its work  examining in particular their economic viability. The Member  States involved are asked to make every effort to ensure that  all the transport projects whose preparation is sufficiently  advanced are started up immediately and that the others are  started up as far as possible during 1996 at the latest by  accelerating administrative, regulatory and legal procedures.  The European Council invites the Commission to take all useful  initiatives in this respect including the convening where  appropriate of project seminars aimed at coordinating the  activities of all parties involved.    The European Council also attaches importance to the other  important transport projects which are set out in the interim  report.    The European Council calls on the Christophersen group  together with the representatives of the acceding states to  continue their work on the basis of the mandate proposed in the  group's report studying further the extension of the  transeuropean networks to neighbouring countries (in particular  to Central and East European countries and to the Mediterranean  Basin) and to prepare a final report to the European Council in  Essen. It also asks the Christophersen group to examine the  question of relevant networks in the field of environment.    As regards financing of networks, the European Council  confirms that measures will be taken -- if proved necessary --  in order that priority projects do not run into financial  obstacles which would jeopardize their implementation. It noted  the conclusions of the ECOFIN council and the studies carried  out by the Commission. This question will continue to be  examined in the Christophersen group and in the ECOFIN council  until the Essen European Council, taking account of the specific  characteristics of each project, the leading role of private  funding and the judicious use of existing Community resources.    The Council will be informed if it appears that the  achievement of certain projects is threatened for financial  reasons linked to insufficient profitability -- for example  because of the length of investments or environmental  constraints. The Council will immediately consider with the  Commission and the EIB the appropriate responses, within the  limits set by the financial perspectives.  <H5>  4. The Information Society </H5>   The European Council took note of the report from the group  of leading figures representing the industry, operators and  users who have been examining the various aspects of this  question under the chairmanship of Mr Bangemann. The European  Council considers that the current unprecedented technological  revolution in the area of information opens up vast  possibilities for economic progress, employment and the quality  of life, while simultaneously representing a major challenge.  It is primarily up to the private sector to respond to this  challenge, by evaluating what is at stake and taking the  necessary initiatives, notably in the matter of financing. The  European Council, like the Commission, considers that the  Community and its Member States do however have an important  role to play in backing up this development by giving political  impetus, creating a clear and stable regulatory framework  (notably as regards access to markets, compatibility between  networks, intellectual property rights, data protection and  copyright) and by setting an example in areas which come under  their aegis. The European Council agreed in general with the  areas of application set out by the group (teleworking, distance  learning, network for universities and research centres,  telematic services for SMEs, road traffic management, air  traffic control, health care networks, electronic tendering,  administrative networks and city information highways). Also  the importance of linguistic and cultural aspects of the  information society was stressed by the European Council.    The European Council, having noted the findings of the  Bangemann group, considers that the importance and complexity of  the issues raised by the new information society justify the  setting up of a permanent co-ordination instrument to ensure  that the various parties involved -- public and private -- are  working along the same lines. This co-ordination instrument, to  be set up as soon as possible, should be based on the  appointment in each Member State of a person responsible at  ministerial level for co-ordinating all aspects of the subject  (political, financial and regulatory) with a view inter alia to  ensuring a co-ordinated approach in the Council. The Commission  will act similarly.    At the level of the Community, the necessary regulatory  framework has to be established as soon as possible. The  European Council invites the Council and the European Parliament  to adopt before the end of the year measures in the areas  already covered by existing proposals. It also invites the  Commission to establish as soon as possible a programme covering  the remaining measures needed at the Community level.    The European Council will assess progress at its meeting in  Essen.  <H5>  5. The Macro-economic Environment </H5>   Regarding major economic trends, the European Council notes  first of all that the Member States have broadly followed the  guidelines laid down by the European Council in December 1993.  Inflation, which is in the process of being overcome, a return  to exchange rate stability and an incipient reduction of public  deficits are creating a sound basis for future growth and  favouring the convergence of economies towards the criteria laid  down in the Maastricht treaty for the final stage of EMU. These  efforts must be continued in order to consolidate the fall in  short-term interest rates and to reverse the recent upward trend  of long-term interest rates, all of which are essential  conditions for stimulating investment and creating jobs.    For all these reasons the European Council endorses the  economic policy guidelines contained in the report submitted by  the ECOFIN Council in accordance with article 103 of the EC  treaty. It invites the Council to finalize the guidelines in  the light of the conclusions of this European Council with  regard to the implementation of the White Paper in general.  <H5>  ii. Common Foreign and Security Policy </H5> <H5>  a. Relations with the Mediterranean countries </H5>   The European Council confirms the importance it attaches to  the close links already existing with its Mediterranean partners  and its wish to develop them still further so that the  Mediterranean area may become an area of cooperation  guaranteeing peace, security, stability and well-being.    The European Council welcomes the progress made in the  negotiations under way with Israel for the conclusion of a new  agreement with a wider scope of application than the 1975  agreements and providing for a closer relationship between the  parties on the basis of reciprocity and common interest. It  considers that this new agreement should be supplemented by a  separate agreement on scientific and technological cooperation.  It also asks the Council and the Commission to do their utmost  to ensure that these two agreements may be completed before the  end of the year.    The European Council considers that these new contractual  links will be strengthened by the development of regional  cooperation involving Israel and the Palestinian side.    The European Council notes with satisfaction the progress  made in the negotiations with Morocco and Tunisia on new  partnership agreements. It asks the Council and the Commission  to do their utmost to ensure that negotiations are completed  before the end of the year.    The European Council also welcomes the opening of  exploratory  conversations between the Commission and the Egyptian  authorities on a new partnership agreement.    The European Council expresses the wish of the European  Union  to develop existing cooperation relations with the Mashreq  countries, taking into account the specific situation of each  country.    The European Council is following closely the situation in  Algeria. It condemns all acts of terrorism and violations of  human rights, both against Algerians and foreign citizens.    The European Council encourages the rigorous pursuit of the  national dialogue and the process of structural reform which is  essential for the liberalization of the Algerian economy and its  better integration into the world economy. The European Council  notes with approval the recent ECOFIN decision to consider  favourably a proposal for further assistance of the order of 200  mecu, subject to Algeria's continuing implementation of its IMF  programme and the position of the loan guarantee fund. Given  the particular importance of this issue, the European Council  invites the ECOFIN council to examine a Commission proposal very  soon.    The European Council hopes that the internal situation in  Algeria will improve so that relations with Algeria can develop  in the framework of this new approach based on partnership.    The European Council stresses the value for all  Mediterranean  partners of jointly examining political, economic and social  problems to which solutions may be more effectively sought in  the context of regional cooperation. The European Council has  given a mandate to the Council to evaluate, together with the  Commission, the global policy of the European Union in the  Mediterranean region and possible initiatives to strengthen this  policy in the short and medium term, bearing in mind the  possibility of convening a conference attended by the European  Union and its Mediterranean partners.    This evaluation should prepare the ground for decisions at  the European Council in Essen.  <H5>  b. Applicant Countries </H5>   The European Council welcomes the significant progress made  regarding the application by Cyprus and Malta for accession to  the European Union and considers that an essential stage in the  preparation process could be regarded as completed.    The European Council asks the Council and the Commission to  do their utmost to ensure that the negotiations with Malta and  Cyprus with a view to the conclusion of the fourth financial  protocols, intended in particular to support the efforts of  Malta and Cyprus towards integration into the European Union,  are brought to a rapid conclusion.    The European Council notes that in these conditions the next  phase of enlargement of the Union will involve Cyprus and Malta.    The European Council, recalling relevant decisions of the  Council of 4 October 1993, 18 April 1994 and 13 June 1994,  reaffirms that any solution of the Cyprus problem must respect  the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and unity  of the country, in accordance with the relevant United Nations  resolutions and high-level agreements.    The European Council welcomes the fact that the Europe  agreements with Hungary and Poland are now in force and that the  first association Council meetings at ministerial level with  those countries have already taken place.    The European Council notes with satisfaction the submission  by Hungary and Poland on 31 March and 4 April 1994 respectively  of their applications to become members of the European Union.  In this respect, it recalls the decisions of the Council to  refer the two applications to the Commission in order to prepare  its respective opinions.    Concerning Turkey, the European Council notes the convening  of the EC-Turkey association council to deal in particular with  the achievement of the customs union foreseen in the association  agreement of 1964.  <H5>  c. Middle East Peace Process </H5>   The European Council warmly welcomes the Cairo agreement  between Israel and the PLO of 4 May 1994 as an important step  towards the full implementation of the declaration of  principles. It pays tribute to the determination of both sides  to achieve a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the  region. The European Council welcomes the contribution already  made by Member States of the European Union to the temporary  international presence in Hebron.    The European Council looks forward to the establishment of  the Palestinian authority in the Gaza Strip and Jericho which  should lead to the early extension of its responsibilities to  the rest of the occupied territories. Recalling the adoption by  the Council on 19 April of a joint action in support of the  Middle East peace process, the European Council welcomes the  creation of a Palestinian police force and restates the Union's  willingness to provide further assistance to move the peace  process towards a successful conclusion.  <H5>  d. Central and East Europe </H5>   At the Copenhagen meeting in June 1993, the European Council  decided that the associated countries of Central and East Europe  which wished to do so could become members of the European Union  as soon as they were able to fulfil the relevant obligations.    The Europe agreements and the decisions taken in Copenhagen  constitute the framework for deepening relations and creating  the context which will enable these conditions to be met. The  further implementation of those agreements and decisions is one  of the essential conditions for accession: their full potential  must now be exploited with a view to preparing for accession.  The European Council recalls the importance of the decisions  taken by the Council on 7 March 1994 on political dialogue,  which should be fully and effectively implemented as a matter of  priority.    The European Council invites the Commission to make specific  proposals as soon as possible for the further implementation of  the Europe agreements and the decisions taken by the European  Council in Copenhagen. The European Council also asks the  presidency and the Commission to report to it for its next  meeting on progress made on this basis, on the process of  alignment since the Copenhagen European Council, and on the  strategy to be followed with a view to preparing for accession.    This will be helped by the development of good-neighbourly  relations, which will be the subject of the stability pact.    The institutional conditions for ensuring the proper  functioning of the Union must be created at the 1996  Intergovernmental Conference, which for that reason must take  place before accession negotiations begin.    The Union and its Member States will continue their contacts  with Slovenia with a view to establishing the best conditions  for increased cooperation with that country. Meanwhile the  Council will continue its examination of a draft mandate for a  Europe agreement.    The European Council welcomes the fact that the negotiations  with the Baltic states for the establishment of free trade areas  are moving towards finalization and reiterates that the  conclusion of Europe agreements with those countries, which will  help them to prepare for subsequent accession, remains the aim  of the Union.    The European Council expects Russia, in conformity with  earlier commitments, to complete its troop withdrawals from  Latvia and Estonia by 31 August 1994.    The European Council attaches importance to the efforts made  by the Baltic states to develop legal and regulatory frameworks  which conform with inter alia the recommendations of the CSCE  High Commissioner and of the Council of Europe. It notes with  concern the adoption by the Latvian parliament of a citizenship  law incompatible with these recommendations and hopes that the  draft law will be reconsidered.  <H5>  e. Pact on Stability </H5>   The European Council welcomes the adoption by the inaugural  conference in Paris of the concluding documents setting in train  the process that will lead to the conclusion of the pact on  stability in Europe.    The European Council calls on the interested countries to  give full expression now to the commitments into which they  entered at the inaugural conference and looks forward to the  early convening of the round tables. For its part, the Union  reaffirms its will to mobilize its economic and financial  instruments as its contribution to the success of this  undertaking.  <H5>  f. Rwanda </H5>   The European Council expresses its horror at the genocide  taking place in Rwanda. Those responsible should be brought to  justice. The European Council appeals urgently to all parties to  the conflict to stop the wanton killing of civilians and to come  back to the negotiating table to work for peace and security for  all, on the basis of the Arusha agreement.    It particularly welcomes the adoption of security council  resolution 929 authorizing the establishment of a temporary  operation, pending the arrival of the reinforced UNAMIR [UN  Assistance Mission in Rwanda], to protect displaced persons,  refugees, and civilians at risk in Rwanda. The European Council  welcomes the 21 June 1994 decision of the Western European Union  to support the efforts of its Member States which have expressed  their willingness to contribute to this operation by ensuring  the coordination of their contributions.    The European Council expresses its appreciation to the  African countries, which have taken up the burden of so many  refugees and are contributing to the political solution of the  conflict. The European Union will for its part continue and  increase its own humanitarian aid.  <H5>  g. Southern Africa </H5>   The European Council applauds the way in which South Africa  has resolutely committed itself to democratic transition,  through the exercise of moderation and national reconciliation.  It welcomes the start of the reintegration of the country into  its region and the larger world community and also pledges to  support the government of this new South Africa, as it addresses  the needs and legitimate aspirations of all its people, whom it  now represents.    The European Council confirms its intention to establish  contractual relations between the European Union and South  Africa in order to promote economic development, trade relations  and political dialogue with South Africa.    The European Council will also encourage the political  stabilization and economic development of the Southern African  region as a whole. In this context, the European Council  recalls the decision to hold a ministerial conference in Berlin  on 5 and 6 September 1994 with the SADC Member States and South  Africa.    The European Council welcomes the substantial progress  achieved in the peace process in Mozambique, which inter alia  has made it possible for the dates of 27 and 28 October 1994 to  be set for general elections. It invites the Council to  consider further ways to support the peace process, in  particular in the field of electoral assistance.    The European Council calls on both the government of  Mozambique and Renamo to abide by their commitment to the  process of national reconciliation.  <H5>  h. Relations With the ACP States </H5>   The European Council reaffirms its attachment to  co-operation  with the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific  [APC], which are facing challenges on an unprecedented scale.  It undertakes to support them in their efforts aimed at  economic and political reform. The mid-term review of Lome IV,  which should result by 1 March 1995 in the revision of certain  provisions of the agreement and the definition of the next  financial protocol, should provide an opportunity to confirm the  European Union's commitment to the ACP States.  <H5>  i. Ukraine </H5>   The European Council welcomes the signature of the  partnership and co-operation agreement with Ukraine, which will  help to pave the way to the development of a full and fruitful  co-operation relationship between Ukraine and the European Union.    The European Council reaffirms the Union's support for the  independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine,  for the consolidation of democratic institutions and the  achievement of market oriented economic reforms. The European  Council emphasises in this context that success will largely  depend on the sustained willingness and ability of the Ukrainian  authorities to carry forward the process of economic and  political reform.    The European Council welcomes the steps already taken by  Ukraine towards the full implementation of nuclear and  conventional disarmament agreements and calls for early  Ukrainian ratification of the non-proliferation treaty as  non-nuclear weapon state.    The European Council invites the council to continue its  work  on the formulation of an overall policy towards Ukraine. In  elaborating such a policy, drawing on the full range of  instruments available under the treaty on European Union,  including possible joint actions, the council should follow  these general guidelines:     -  Sustained support for the  consolidation of democratic institutions, for respect for human  rights and for the achievement of market oriented economic  reforms;    -  The promotion of good neighbourly relations between  Ukraine and its neighbours;    -  Cooperation with Ukraine in  multilateral fora within an overall energy policy.     The European Council expresses its preoccupation with the  global issue of nuclear safety in Ukraine. The European Council  recommends in particular that the Chernobyl nuclear plant be  closed definitively and as early in support of regional and  international stability and the peaceful settlement of  disputes;%Support for the full implementation of nuclear and  conventional disarmament agreements;%Acceptance by Ukraine of  internationally accepted nuclear safety standardsas possible.  This closure should be implemented through a combination  of:     -  The immediate and definitive closure of reactors 1 and  2 of Chernobyl together with, as early as possible, the closure  of reactor 3, subject to compensation through the termination  and upgrading to adequate safety standards of three reactors  under construction in Zaporoje, Rovno and Khmelnitosky;    -  An  immediate structural reform of the energy sector in Ukraine,  including an effective tariffication and pricing policy, and  measures to promote energy saving, and the development of  alternative sources of energy;    -  An immediate and determined  effort to strengthen and upgrade construction and operation  standards for safety in the nuclear sector, with the aim of  achieving standards corresponding to those applied in the  European Union. The achievement of this objective should be  monitored by independent inspectors;    -  the ratification of the  Vienna convention on nuclear liability.     The European Union wishes to reach an agreement with Ukraine  on this set of actions in the field of nuclear safety and is  prepared to provide substantial help in a comprehensive plan to  be discussed with its partners in the forthcoming G-7 summit.  This plan will involve financial effort from the international  community, including international financial institutions. The  European Union, for its part, is willing to raise 400 MECU  [million ECU's] in EURATOM loans and, in addition, to provide  100 Mecu over three years under the TACIS programme for this  plan.    Finally, the European Union expresses the strong hope that  the next G-7 summit in Naples will agree to propose to the  Ukraine a joint effort to underpin the reform process, in  particular in the field of nuclear safety.  <H5>  j. North Korea </H5>   The European Council is deeply concerned by the failure of  the democratic people's republic of Korea to allow the iaea  inspectors to complete essential inspection activities, making  it impossible to conclude whether diversion of plutonium from  peaceful uses has taken place. The continued failure of the  democratic people's republic of Korea to comply with the  provisions of the DPRK-IAEA safeguard agreement is contrary to  its international obligations.    The European Council considers nuclear proliferation a major  threat to international peace and security and recalls its  longstanding commitment to the aims of the non-proliferation  treaty. The European Council calls again on the democratic  people's republic of Korea to recognise and respect its  international responsibilities and confirms that prospects for a  better relationship with North Korea would be greatly enhanced  if concerns about its nuclear activities could be alleviated.  It expresses the hope that the exchanges being pursued with  North Korea will result rapidly in a satisfactory solution.  <H5>  k. Latin America </H5>   The European Council reaffirms the importance it attaches to  its relations with Latin American countries and their regional  groupings. It expresses its satisfaction with the progress  achieved in the areas of democracy and respect for human rights,  peace and disarmament, economic reforms and regional integration.    In this context, the European Council welcomes the  accession of Mexico to the OECD and expresses its wish to  strengthen its political and economic relations with this  country. It also confirms the intention of the European Union  to strengthen its relations with MERCOSUR. It invites the  Council and the Commission to pursue these questions further.  <H5>  l. Guidelines for a Joint Action on the Preparation of the </H5> 1995 Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the  Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons    The European Council, recalling its firm and full commitment  in favour of the objective of nuclear non-proliferation stated  in the 1990 declaration adopted by the European Council in  Dublin, the report on Common Foreign and Security Policy  submitted to the 1992 European Council in Lisbon as well as the  report submitted to the 1992 European Council in Edinburgh on  the development of the common foreign and security policy in the  field of security, agrees that a joint action shall be adopted  concerning the preparation of the 1995 conference of the parties  to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).    The joint action should be prepared along the following  lines:     -  The basis for the joint action is consensus among  partners that the NPT should be extended indefinitely and  unconditionally;    -  Joint efforts have to be made in order to  promote this goal among states parties to the treaty which might  not share this conviction;    -  The aim of universality of the NPT  requires joint efforts in order to convince states which are not  yet parties to the NPT to accede, if possible before 1995, and  to assist the states ready to accede in accelerating their  accession.     In order to enhance the prospects for a successful outcome  of  the 1995 NPT conference, demarches have to be made with a view  to:     -  Promoting participation in the remaining two prepcom  sessions in Geneva and New York respectively and the 1995  conference itself;    -  Widening consensus on the aim of indefinite  and unconditional extension of the NPT.   <H5>  m. Former Yugoslavia </H5>   The European Council is deeply concerned by the continuation  of the conflict in former Yugoslavia and particularly in Bosnia  and Herzegovina.    In Geneva on 13 May, the European Union along with Russia  and  the United States demonstrated their determination to work  together for an early and durable settlement of the Bosnian  conflict through negotiations. The work of the contact group  has reached a critical stage. The European Council expects the  parties to show the necessary political will in order to reach a  solution to the conflict as soon as possible.    The European Council urges the Bosnian parties to build on  the cease- fire agreement of 8 june 1994. This is, however,  only a first step towards a complete cessation of hostilities  which is essential for progress in the negotiations. The  European Council is committed to a settlement that preserves  Bosnia and Herzegovina as a single union within its  internationally recognized borders, while providing for  constitutional arrangements that establish the relationship  between the Bosniac-Croat and Bosnian Serb entities on the basis  of a territorial arrangement which would allocate 51% of the  territory to the Bosniac-Croat entity and 49% to the Bosnian  Serb entity.    The European Council welcomes the progress made in the  reconciliation between Bosniacs and Bosnian Croats based on the  agreements for the establishment of the Bosniac-Croat  Federation. The European Union has responded positively to the  invitation to provide for the administration of Mostar for a  period of up to two years. The European Council welcomes the  readiness of WEU to contribute a police element to this  administration. The European Council calls on the parties  concerned to approve the memorandum of understanding thus  opening the way for signature without delay. The early  establishment of the EU administration is an important step  towards stabilization of the situation in Bosnia. In this  context the European Council reiterates the readiness of the  European Union to make its contribution to rehabilitation, the  return of refugees and reconstruction in Bosnia-Herzegovina  within the framework of the efforts of the international  community.    The European Council expresses its disappointment at the  cancellation of the Plitvice meeting between the Croatian  government and the Krajina Serbs. The council calls for the  early resumption of these talks and on the Serbs to show the  necessary flexibility with a view to achieving a solution in the  unpas in accordance with the action plan of the European Union.  <H5>  iii. Cooperation on Justice and Home Affairs </H5> <H5>  1. Racism and Xenophobia </H5>   The European Council condemns the continuing manifestations  of intolerance, racism and xenophobia and affirms its  determination to step up the fight against these phenomena.    It welcomes the joint Franco-German initiative against  racism  and xenophobia in which it is proposed in particular  to:     -  Constitute a consultative commission composed of  eminent personalities charged with making recommendations on  co-operation between governments and the various social bodies  in favour of encouraging tolerance and understanding of  foreigners;    -  Develop a global strategy at the Union level aimed  at combating acts of racist and xenophobic violence;    -  Set up  training efforts for officials in those parts of the national  administrations most concerned by these phenomena.     The European Council invites the General Affairs Council to  examine the mandate, composition and status of the consultative  commission proposed in the Franco-German initiative and report  to the European Council in Essen on the interim results of the  work of that Commission. It invited the ministers of justice  and the interior to report on their work at the next European  Council in Essen. Finally, it requests that current work in the  education and social affairs councils in this field should be  speeded up in the light of the Franco-German initiative.    Finally, the European Council approved a detailed timetable  and work plan with a view to the adoption by the European  Council by the end of June 1995 of an overall strategy of the  Union (Annex iii).  <H5>  2. Implementation of the Priority Plan </H5>   The European Council notes with satisfaction the progress  made in implementing its priority action plan drawn up in  Brussels in December 1993, including the submission by the  Commission of a new drugs plan which proposes an important new  framework for the prevention of drug dependency, the reduction  of drug trafficking and action on the international level. It  expects this work to be accelerated so that the Essen European  Council will be able to record that concrete measures have been  taken in all areas covered by the action plan (Europol, global  strategy on combating drugs, common list for visas, judicial  co-operation, asylum, co-ordination with the common foreign and  security policy).    The Council underlined in general the importance of work  within the framework of the co-operation on justice and home  affairs to tackle the threats posed by organised crime  (including terrorism) and drugs. It invited the justice and  home affairs council to complete its work on preparing a  convention setting up Europol by the beginning of October and  agreed that Europol's remit should be extended to include  organized crime as its next priority. The European Council  invited the German presidency to arrange a conference with the  Central and East European states on drugs and organized crime.  The European Council asked the justice and home affairs council  to reach agreement on tackling the criminal aspects of fraud and  report back to its meeting at Essen in December.    In the context of preparation of the various instruments  providing for the setting up of computerized systems, the  problem of data protection must be given particular attention,  notably as regards the following aspects: right of access by  persons concerned to the system, right of appeal by individuals  and creation of a common supervisory authority. The European  Council asks the competent bodies to continue to give priority  to these questions and hopes to receive a progress report at its  meeting in December 1994.  <H5>  iv. Preparation of the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference </H5>   The European Council, following the Ioannina agreement,  hereby establishes a reflection group to prepare for the 1996  Intergovernmental Conference consisting of representatives of  the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Member States and the  President of the Commission. It will be chaired by a person  appointed by the Spanish Government and begin its work in June  1995. Two European Parliament representatives will participate  in the work of the reflection group. The group will also have  exchanges of views with the other institutions and organs of the  European Union.    The institutions are invited to establish before the start  of  the work of the reflection group reports on the functioning of  the treaty on European Union which will provide an input for the  work of the group.    The reflection group will examine and elaborate ideas  relating to the provisions of the treaty on European Union for  which a revision is foreseen and other possible improvements in  a spirit of democracy and openness, on the basis of the  evaluation of the functioning of the treaty as set out in the  reports. It will also elaborate options in the perspective of  the future enlargement of the Union on the institutional  questions set out in the conclusions of the european council in  Brussels and in the Ioannina agreement. (weighting of votes, the  threshold for qualified majority decisions, number of members of  the Commission and any other measure deemed necessary to  facilitate the work of the institutions and guarantee their  effective operation in the perspective of enlargement.)    The Secretary General of the Council will make the necessary  arrangements for the secretariat of the reflection group in  agreement with its president.    The reflection group will report in time for the meeting of  the European Council at the end of 1995. The procedure laid  down in the treaty relating to revision will apply to the next  phase.    The European Council took note of the intention of the  upcoming German presidency to take bilateral contacts with  delegations in order to prepare a decision on the designation of  the future President of the Commission at an extroardinary  European Council to be held in Brussels on 15 July.  <H5>  Annex i </H5>   List of high priority transport projects adopted by the  European Council: projects; countries involved:     -  High speed  train combined transport North South I/A/D Brenner axis  Verona-Muenchen-Nuernberg-Erfurt-Halle/Leipzig-Berlin    -  High speed  train Paris-Bruxelles-Koln-Amsterdam-London     The following sections of the project are included  Belgium:     -  F/B border-Bruxelles-Liege-b/d border B  Bruxelles-B/NL border    -  United Kingdom: London-channel tunnel  access UK    -  Netherlands: B/NL border-Rotterdam-Amsterdam  NL    -  Germany: Aachen-Cologne-Rhein/Main    -  High speed train  South    -  Madrid-Barcelona-Perpignan-Montpellier  E/F    -  Madrid-Vitoria-Dax E/F    -  High speed train East     The following sections of the project are  included     -  Paris-Metz-Strasbourg-Appenweier-Karlsruhe F with  junctions to Metz-Saarbruecken-Mannheim F/D and Metz-Luxemburg  F/L    -  Betuwe line: combined transport/conventional rail NL/D  Rotterdam-NL/D border-Rhein/Ruhr    -  High speed train/combined  transport France-Italy    -  Lyon-Turin F/I    -  Motorway  Patras-Greek/Bulgarian border/ GR jointly with the West-East  motorway corridor: via Egnatia Igoumenitsa-Thessaloniki-  Alexandroupolis-Ormenio/Kipi    -  Motorway Lisbon-Valladolid  P/E    -  Cork-Dublin-Belfast-Larne-Stranraer rail link IRL/UK    -  airport  Malpensa (Milano) I    -  fixed rail/road link between Denmark and  Sweden (Oeresund fixed link) DK/S including access routes   <H5>  Annex ii </H5>   List of energy projects which the European Council has given  priority status:     -  France - Italy: electricity  interconnection;    -  Italy - Greece: electricity interconnection  (cable);    -  Denmark: East-West electricity connection (cable) (not  eligible for structural funds);    -  Portugal: natural gas  network;    -  Greece: natural gas network;    -  Spain - Portugal: natural  gas interconnections;    -  Spain - Portugal: electricity  interconnections;    -  Algeria - Morocco - European Union gas  pipeline;    -  Russia - Belarus - Poland - European Union: gas  pipeline including the introduction of natural gas in the  extremadura and galicia regions of spain.

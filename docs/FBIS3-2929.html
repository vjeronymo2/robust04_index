			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondents Ding Jianming (0002 1017 6900) and Tian </F> Zhiwei (3944 1807 0251)]    [Text] Beijing, 14 Mar (XINHUA) -- Zhejiang Governor Wan  Xueyuan said here today: Zhejiang's overall strength has  increased rapidly in the past 15 years of reform and opening to  the outside world. Next, Zhejiang will, in accordance with the  requirements set by the party Central Committee and the State  Council, open wider to the outside world, deepen the reform, and  optimize the economic structure, raise the quality of economic  growth to ensure a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of  its economy.    The news center of the "two sessions" held a news conference  this morning and invited Zhejiang Governor Wan Xueyuan, Ningbo  City Mayor Xu Yunhong, Hangzhou City Mayor Wang Yongming, and  Wenzhou City Mayor Chen Wenxian to meet with Chinese and foreign  reporters.    In response to a reporter's question on what Zhejiang has  done or will do in the area of building and cultivating a  socialist market system, Wang Xueyuan replied, saying: Zhejiang  started the reform of the market structure early, and it has  developed its own characteristics in the process of developing a  market economic structure. First, Zhejiang has been known as a  "large market province" because of its early effort to cultivate  markets. There are now over 4,300 markets of various types in  the province, 107 of which can handle over 100 million yuan  each. Markets for capital, labor, technology, real estate, and  other basic means of products are being developed rapidly. At  present, the role and scope of the market mechanism have  expanded considerably in the operation of Zhejiang's economy. A  profound change has taken place in the government's functions  and methods of organizing the economy, and mandatory plans under  the jurisdiction of the province have all been abolished.    Wan Xueyuan said: The development of markets has promoted  Zhejiang's economic development. This year, Zhejiang will  strive to improve all types of services and accelerate the  establishment of markets for the basic means of production,  especially financial, technological, and labor markets. At the  same time, in close conjunction with the state's major reform  measures, the province will improve macroeconomic regulation and  control, deepen enterprise reform, and step up the building of a  system of social security. Through a few years of efforts, we  will strive to initially build a modern enterprise system, a  distribution system, a social security system, and a  macroeconomic control system meeting the requirements of a  market economy, thereby forming an open and integrated market  system.    In response to a question on whether the tax reform of this  year will affect the town and village enterprises, Wan Xueyuan  said: Zhejiang's town and village enterprises have developed  rapidly in the past few years. Their output value has accounted  for 60 percent of the province's total industrial output value.  In the process of deepening the reform, town and village  enterprises are faced with many challenges -- challenges from  state-owned enterprises whose strength has been enhanced through  the transformation of operating mechanisms and challenges from  the private sector. With the introduction of the new tax  system, the abolition of preferential policies on tax reductions  and exemptions followed. This, in fact, has increased the tax  burden on some town and village enterprises. But this should be  viewed from another angle -- town and village enterprises have  formed a flexible mechanism whereby they are responsible for  their own decisions regarding management, for their own profits  and losses, and for their own development and reform.  Improvements and pressures, as well as the pressure of market  competition, brought about by reform will prod the processing  industries into readjusting the investment structure, the  production setup, and the product mix. Therefore, we can say  there are both difficulties and opportunities, but opportunities  and hopes outstrip difficulties.    Hangzhou Mayor Wang Yongming, Ningbo Mayor Xu Yunhong, and  Wenzhou Mayor Chen Wenxian also answered reporters' questions.</p>

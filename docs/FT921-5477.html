			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Fisons' sorry story FT-SE Index: 2,565.4 (+11.1) There was a depressing air about yesterday's annual results from Fisons. A company supposedly intent on demonstrating a new-found frankness managed to look as secretive and self-satisfied as ever in confirming that earnings last year fell by a fifth. Such details of the disasters in the US as it volunteered merely served to emphasise the deep-seated nature of the group's problems there. The novel release of sales figures for its main drug products was tarnished by their unusual derivation from outside survey sources, while the attempt to disguise a flat underlying sales trend by excluding associate companies and re-stating the previous year's figures came across as worryingly naive. A net cash outflow of Pounds 60m, the Pounds 10m interest bill and the jump in gearing to 38 per cent suggested that even the group's renowned financial skills have not been immune. By the standards of its peers, Fisons is shrinking. If the vacant chief executive's position is filled by an aggressive outsider, it is conceivable that the management culture will be given a shake-up. The fact that after four years a supposed wonder-product such as Tilade purportedly has worldwide sales of only Pounds 20m reveals the extent of Fisons' difficulties. A larger company might well have been able to make a better fist of exploiting its undoubted commercial prospects. Fisons has sensibly admitted that its drugs division will not be independent for much longer. Talk of joint ventures remains vague, but at least the subject has been broached. Admittedly, it is possible that Fisons will pull off a recovery on its own, in which case its shares look cheap. But given that the shares have now barely outperformed the market over five years, investors will doubtless not be taking that on trust.</p>

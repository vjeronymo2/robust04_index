			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Mexico may impose environmental tax THE Mexican government is considering a trade-related 'green tax' to raise money for environmental enforcement and clean-up, according to a senior Mexican official. Mr Santiago Onate, attorney-general for environmental protection, said in Washington yesterday the government was trying to find a tax permissible under the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 'We don't want to generate some kind of subsidy,' he said. Some sort of user-fee is likely to be more acceptable. A 'green tax' would not necessarily fall on polluters, but could be levied more widely, such as on exports and imports. Mexico has already begun to spend Dollars 400m (Pounds 209.4m) on a US-Mexican border clean-up plan, and more funding is expected, Mr Onate said. Hundreds of foreign companies have manufacturing plants on the border, taking advantage of cheap Mexican labour, duty-free exports to the US and low environmental standards. But the US Congress has yet to approve funding for the clean-up plan, although the Bush Administration has given a commitment to participate. 'If the US doesn't want to take charge of its part, then it is too bad for them,' Mr Onate said. Although the negotiations for a free trade agreement between the US, Mexico and Canada appear to be moving toward a conclusion, there is bitterness in Mexico about a controversial US Supreme Court ruling which upheld the US kidnapping of a Mexican doctor. Dr Humberto Alvarez Hachain is now awaiting trial in Los Angeles for his alleged role in the torture of a US drug enforcement agent. Joint dispute settlement, environmental action and inspections would have been 'a very sound idea' before the Supreme Court raised the issue of the US honouring international law, Mr Onate said. 'We have now a new task, that in order to fulfil actions that in the past could have been very easy ..now they have to be more clearly designed, the rules more clearly set and explained to the public.' Environmental issues may be a key to Congressional approval of a North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr Onate's message was Mexico's commitment that all future development must be 'approached within limits of sustainable growth' and environmental considerations. The government, he said, had decided to allow all citizens to sue for damages due to environmental hazards or to file complaints anonymously. If they wanted, they could accompany environmental inspectors. There would be no new money next year for additional inspectors, but those employed were undergoing more rigorous training.</p>

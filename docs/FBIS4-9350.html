			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, April 24 (TANJUG) -- The scenario for  postponing the peace process and fanning the flames of war, so  generously used in the former Yugoslav Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina so far, was once again followed in the case  of Gorazde, Prime Minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  Radoje Kontic said on Sunday. Every time peace was close at  hand or whenever talks between the warring sides became  deadlocked through a fault of the Moslems or Croats, Serbs would  be provoked into military action or a massacre of civilians  would be staged, with the inevitable effect of postponing the  peace process and fanning the war, Kontic said in a statement to  Radio Kragujevac.    From Gorazde, a Moslem enclave in eastern  Bosnia-Herzegovina,  which should have been demilitarized in spring last year as a  U.N. protected area, Moslems launched an offensive against Serb  positions in late March. When the Moslems were threatened with  military defeat, NATO bombed Serb positions around the town on  April 10 and 11 allegedly to protect the local U.N. observers.  Since this did not affect the situation on the front, NATO set  another ultimatum to Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina on Friday, this  time that they withdraw to 3km from Gorazde by 00:01 GMT Sunday  or be bombed (again).    The bombing did not take place because Serbs from  Bosnia-Herzegovina, under an agreement with head of the U.N.  Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi,  started to withdraw, and around 200 peace-keepers have arrived  in Gorazde and have begun their deployment in the buffer zone  between Serb and Moslem forces. Assessing that the plan of the  European Union (E.U.) on Bosnia-Herzegovina as a union of three  ethnic republics had offered a real perspective for resolving  the crisis quickly, Kontic said that Serbs had practically met  all the Moslem demands, so that it had seemed that the solution  was on the horizon. "And then the U.S. enforced the  Moslem-Croat federation and the confederation with Croatia,  without any participation of the Serbs, and at their expense in  fact, because new concessions by the Serb side had been counted  on," the Yugoslav prime minister said. In order to get Serbs to  make these concessions, it was necessary to intimidate them with  air strikes, or blacken them once again in the eyes of the world  community and justify the siding against them, Kontic said.    Commenting on the U.S. demands for the destruction of  bridges  and other forms of communication between the Serb Republic in  former Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia,  Kontic assessed that such demands which come from extremist  circles and individuals should not disturb Yugoslav citizens and  cause their concern. "Even if this did take place, it would be  an act of aggression on an independent and sovereign country and  the answer would be unequivocal and clear. Yugoslavia has such  a force that can be placed in the defence of the country at a  moment's notice," the Yugoslav prime minister said. "The  situation is monitored continually and measures are taken to  protect our borders. That is why certain funds are earmarked  for equipping the army with modern weapons and strengthening the  country's defence even at this moment when the economic  situation is very difficult," Kontic told Radio Kragujevac.</p>

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Further delays hit Crest system The Stock Exchange signalled yesterday that it might not be able to speed share settlement further by the middle of next year, saying that it would make a firm decision at the end of October. The Stock Exchange last month abandoned its two-week or three-week account settlement period in favour of rolling settlement 10 days after each bargain is struck - the initial phase of a move to develop the new Crest system for paperless share settlement. Crest, a project spearheaded by the Bank of England, is intended to narrow the settlement period to three days after each bargain is struck. Mr Pen Kent, associate director of the Bank, had earlier set a target date for 'T plus Five' - five days after the date of the trade - of no later than the middle of next year. In a recent letter to Mr Michael Lawrence, Stock Exchange chairman, Mr Kent said that the Bank would not be involved in the move to speed share settlement to five days after trade date. He said: 'We will remain fully behind the further move to five-day settlement but do not expect that this will require a major contribution from the Crest team, which is devoting all its resources to the development phase.' Meanwhile, Thompson Financial Services, a provider of software for securities trading and settlement, said yesterday it had extended its electronic trade confirmation service to Asia, where it would be able to speed share settlement both in the region and for cross-border transactions in the US and Europe. The Bank has said that the ability to confirm trades electronically is essential for cutting settlement periods.</p>

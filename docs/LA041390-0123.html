			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHAMPION SPARK PLUG TO CLOSE 2 PLANTS  </P> <P> Champion Spark Plug will consolidate its U.S. manufacturing operations by  closing two plants, company officials said.  </P> <P> Under Champions's plan, plants in Toledo and Detroit will be integrated over  the next two years into the company's Burlington, Iowa, and Cambridge, Ohio,  facilities.  </P> <P> Plans call for the company and the United Auto Workers to meet regarding the  timing and effects of the consolidation on production and maintenance  personnel.  </P> <P> There currently are 245 salaried and hourly workers in Detroit and 403 in  Toledo whose jobs would be affected.  </P> <P> Company officials said new jobs in Burlington and Cambridge would be created as  a result of the move.  </P> <P> "We sincerely regret the impact this announcement would have on employees in  Detroit and Toledo and on the two cities," said Jerry Godwin, Champion  president.  </P> <P> "Champion has been struggling for several years with an overcapacity of  production facilities, while at the same time selling a product -- spark plugs  -- whose overall market has declined," Godwin said at a news conference.  </P> <P> Champion plants in Toledo produce spark plug shells and assemble the final  spark plugs. The Detroit plant manufactures ceramic insulation used in the  plug.  </P> <P> Champion is a division of Houston-based Cooper Industries Inc., which purchased  the company last year.  </P></p>

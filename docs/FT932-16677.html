			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Japanese 'losing faith in leaders' THE Japanese are increasingly disillusioned with their politicians and have lost confidence in the country's direction, according to an annual survey by the prime minister's office, which found respondents unusually gloomy. A record 70.1 per cent of the 10,000 polled said public opinion was not properly reflected in national politics. The negative response follows a series of scandals involving the ruling Liberal Democratic party in recent months. The level of disillusionment was highest among the young. About 81 per cent of those aged between 30 and 34 said their opinions were not reflected in political debate. Overall, 23.5 per cent of respondents thought that politics did take into account their opinions. As for the country's general direction, a record high of 44.3 per cent, up from 35.5 per cent in the previous year, said Japan was 'off course', with most concerned about a decline in working conditions and job security. Meanwhile, only 31.4 per cent consider that Japan is still on course. The survey found that 49.8 per cent of respondents think Japan is valued by the international community, down from the 50 per cent of a year ago, but still above the 41.1 per cent who suggested that the country is not valued.</p>

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Lamont eager to stay chancellor MR NORMAN LAMONT has made clear his determination to remain chancellor. In interviews yesterday he said he wanted no other job in government. There has been growing speculation at Westminster that he will be moved in a Christmas or new year cabinet reshuffle. He had been criticised over the recession, disclosures about his Access credit card bill, and the Treasury's partial payment of legal fees incurred over an unwanted tenant in his private house. Interviewed by the Wall Street Journal, Mr Lamont said there was 'absolutely' other job that interested him in government. He told The Times that his work as chancellor was 'like living a thriller; there is no other way I would like to spend my life.' Mr Lamont has shown his irritation at his treatment by the press in the past two weeks, saying the media were in danger of abusing their powers in the way the unions did in the 1970s. The herd instinct of newspapers would prove their undoing, he predicted. This week Mr Lamont has called in Peter Carter-Ruck and Partners, the law firm, over reports in some newspapers about his credit card transactions. But Mr Lamont is not believed to be a supporter of a privacy bill. The chancellor was in Brussels negotiating Britain's future when newspapers began inquiring about his credit card bill. 'To have to leave that meeting to telephone my private office to answer questions about whether I had bought a bottle of wine in Paddington, and the price of that wine, was the height of absurdity,' he told The Times. Checks have been made on the Treasury account used to help pay Mr Lamont's legal bills for evicting a tenant, it was disclosed today. Mr Anthony Nelson, Treasury economic secretary, said in a Commons written reply that, apart from the Pounds 4,700 payment to Carter-Ruck, the only others relating to MPs were the purchase of minor stationery items for ministers' offices. Mr Dale Campbell-Savours, Labour MP for Workington, had asked for details of payments out of the account since the Tories came to power. Mr Nelson said it was 'a sundry payments account'. It was not possible to check records as far back as 1979.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Nikolay Geronin] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 3 TASS -- A meeting of South Korean  President Kim Yong-sam with Russian and South Korean businessmen  was held today at Moscow's Metropol Hotel to discuss ways to  upgrade bilateral economic relations.    The meeting was attended by First Russian Vice-Premier Oleg  Soskovets and vice-premier, Minister of Economy Aleksandr  Shokhin, President of the Russian Union of Industrialists and  Entrepreneurs Arkadiy Volskiy and President of the South Korean  Daewoo concern Kim Woo Jung.    The South Korean president made a brief speech to urge a  boost to bilateral economic cooperation.    The head of the Daewoo concern told ITAR-TASS that bilateral  economic cooperation is promising. At the same time, there are  certain obstacles on the way of more active South Korean  businesses in Russia, including the absence of a clear legal  basis for activities of foreign companies in Russia.    The imperfect Russian legislation slows down the  participation of foreign firms in development of Russian  economy, President of the Russian Union of Industrialists and  Entrepreneurs Volskiy told ITAR- TASS.    Other Commonwealth republics have adopted laws on protection  of foreign investments from political risks and guarantees of  the right to export revenues. That is why, some foreign  companies leave Russia for Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. For  instance, the Daewoo concern has started to build a car plant in  the Uzbek city of Namangan with an overall production capacity  of 200,000 cars and vans a year.    At the same time, there are possibilities to boost  Russian-South Korean economic relations, said Volskiy. There  are plenty of South Korean proposals to participate in  corporatization of Russian plants. A gas pipeline from Yakutia  to South Korea is being discussed. The Daewoo concern and the  St. Petersburg Pozitron plant have signed an agreement on  production of video cassette players.</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / UK Company News: A badly-timed deal in an evolving marketplace / A look at the problems facing Isosceles as it plans a reflotation of the Gateway chain ON A table in the middle of the Isosceles boardroom stands a handsome gold clock commemorating a bond issue launched by the previous owners of the Gateway supermarket chain. The clock was presented to the company by a finance house which earned fee income from the issue. It is running two hours late. Although it marks a past event in Gateway's corporate history, the clock is highly symbolic of its current fate: first, because it emphasises the company's dependence on its bankers; and second, because it suggests that Gateway's current owners have got their timing badly wrong. When the Isosceles investment company bought Gateway in the summer of 1989 in a highly-leveraged Pounds 2.1bn deal, the biggest of its kind in UK corporate history, high hopes were held out that the company could be stripped down and spruced up and returned to the market within three to five years. Peripheral assets would be sold, the core strengths of the business would be revealed and a generous return would be generated for the backers of the controversial deal. Three years on, the picture looks very different. Still weighed down by Pounds 1.3bn of debt, with its trading position deteriorating daily, Isosceles is beginning to face up to the realities of an agonising dilemma: how it can possibly return the company to the market without just crystallising substantial losses for its investors? Such thoughts will dominate the minds of both the company and its bankers this summer as they sit down to review the results of Gateway's financial year, which has just ended, and its development programme, which has just begun. The talks are likely to be tense. City analysts suggest Gateway has performed poorly over the past year as a result of a further loss of market share to its voracious rivals, such as J Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway. The company's cash flow is believed to be lower than budgeted and some of its banking covenants may well be breached. A Pounds 100m bond is repayable in April next year. Further complications may arise when Ernst &amp; Young, Isosceles' auditors, go through the books in detail. Industry observers suggest the auditors may legitimately raise questions about the carrying values of some of the company's properties. An asset write-down may well result. Yet in spite of these weighty concerns, Mr Alistair Mitchell-Innes, Isosceles' chief executive, betrays few signs of nervousness. Relaxed and reassuring, he brushes aside the doubts in the manner of a polished diplomat dismissing some local trouble in a far-away country. Although he only became chief executive last September, he accepts that Isosceles' original time-table has been disrupted. Isosceles was able to dispose of 60 superstores to Asda for Pounds 705m soon after the completion of the acquisition but other assets have been far harder to sell. 'The market for assets collapsed fairly soon after the acquisition and they were unable to pay down debt as quickly as they would have liked,' he says, although he adds that Isosceles is still planning to return Gateway to the market within the next 18 months to two years. He suggests, however, that Isosceles' cash constraints - and next year's bond repayment - will be eased by the end of the calendar year through the sale of Herman's, its US sporting goods subsidiary, and the flotation of Wellworths, its highly profitable Irish grocery chain. The problem with this scenario is that Herman's has been on the market for a long time to no avail. Industry gossip has it that Isosceles turned down a Pounds 200m offer for Herman's soon after the acquisition and would now be lucky to receive Pounds 80m. Wellworths may be sold to a trade buyer before flotation for about Pounds 150m, although one interested party, Fitzwilton, the Irish investment group, is believed to have dropped out of the running in recent weeks. However, although these sales may help tide Isosceles over in the short term they will not solve its acute strategic challenge of how to create a profitable growth business out of its 635 high street stores. Mr Mitchell-Innes accepts Isosceles must have a plausible story to tell before it can hope to return to the market. 'In my view a flotation would only be sensible when we have enough evidence and enough stores to show that we have a serious retail proposition which is profitable,' he says. He argues that Gateway has already achieved a great deal in improving the profitability of the core business. Costs have been cut, 1,000 jobs have been taken out of Gateway's head office and eight distribution centres have been closed. 'People say that all the easy things have been done although they are not so easy when you have to do them.' But Mr Mitchell-Innes is pinning the company's hopes for growth on the launch of new retail formats. Gateway has already launched an 18-outlet chain of discount superstores under the banner of Food Giant, utilising the underperforming space of its remaining superstores. And it is rapidly converting other stores - currently 25, but up to 150 within the next three years - to the Somerfield format, an attractive high street chain emphasising fresh foods. Next month, Gateway will also experiment with other formats and will launch four convenience stores, four discount stores based on a recent 'red spot' price experiment, and four traditional town centre supermarkets. Some of the names of the regional supermarket chains which were absorbed by Gateway in its acquisitive days of the 1980s - such as Fine Fare, International and David Greig - may be re-launched to address different segments of the food market. 'The expression used is that we are a disparate not a desperate group', says Mr Mitchell-Innes. 'I see a lot of strengths in our positioning. The grocery trade has deserted the high street. Not everybody can shop or wants to shop at superstores.' While praising the ingenuity of Isosceles' trading experiments, many analysts doubt the long-term sustainability of these formats. They suggest that although refits often lead to a short-term boost in profitability they rarely reverse long-term trends in a store's trading patterns. Gateway's expansion will also crucially depend on its capital expenditure budget and this too is under pressure. Mr Mitchell-Innes says Isosceles invested about Pounds 100m last year although much of that was used to satisfy basic infrastructure needs to comply with the needs of the Food Safety Act. Analysts estimate Gateway only spent Pounds 30m on expanding the business - about the same as Tesco spends on one of its biggest superstores. Mr Mitchell-Innes hopes he will be able to increase the company's capital budget in the future - although he will first have to persuade the bankers that cash is better used in reinvesting in the business than paying down debt early. In the meantime, Tesco alone will have built 100 more stores by 1995. Isosceles plans to announce its annual results in the first week of July - although they may be delayed by any refinancing talks - and investors will naturally be keen to hear an update of the flotation plans. At present, many prominent investment institutions are feeling embarrassed at their exposure to Isosceles and are staring at uncomfortably high write-downs on their equity investments. Mercury Asset Management said it had written down its investment in Isosceles by between Pounds 1m and Pounds 3.5m at March 31, its last financial year end. It refused to specify the exact amount, or the size of its stake. Mr Mitchell-Innes is still cautiously optimistic about the prospects for a flotation. 'Anybody who says that they are absolutely fully confident would be a fool. I do not know what the market will be like over the next 18 months to two years. But I actually believe that the formula that we have now is a very good one that will give us the opportunity to find a way to an exit,' he says. However, it is increasingly difficult to take issue with the assessment of one leading rival retailer who argues that the Gateway acquisition was founded on a fatal misapprehension, compounded by the high price they were forced to pay as a result of a bidding war. He argues that the main architects of the deal, Mr David Smith and Ms Elizabeth Hignell (who were later forced out of the company with a shared Pounds 1.8m pay-off) constructed complex cash flow models showing that Isosceles could generate a healthy return on its investment. But in his view, they failed to understand the commercial dynamics of the UK market and made their investment calculations on the evidence of the relatively mature US market where food retailers' future cash flow and earnings could be predicted with a high degree of accuracy. 'Isosceles completely misread the UK food market. The market here is still evolving. The ownership of a store does not give you a strong defensive position because other people are opening stores and continually eroding your position,' he says. 'But it is the naivety of the City and financial institutions that is really staggering. Financial men can always talk to the City with greater potency than retailers. Fund managers - and journalists - were simply wowed by a compelling story.'</p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AGAIN THE AGONY;  </P> <P> ISRAEL'S BRILLIANT DISASTER  </P> <P> As the late Moshe Dayan once said, "Israel has no foreign policy, only a  defense policy."  </P> <P> The Dayan dictum was confirmed by Israel's kidnaping of Sheik Abdel Karim  Obeid. As a military operation it was brilliantly successful. In its impact on  Israel's foreign relations it is a disaster. And I think the full scale of the  disaster has not yet emerged.  </P> <P> The Islamic response to the kidnaping -- announcement of the murder of U.S.  Marine Corps Lt. Col. William R. Higgins -- has proved horribly effective,  politically. A major objective of Israel's enemies is to drive a wedge between  Israel and the United States. And it is now clear that American hostages  provide the ideal hammer for wedge-driving. All you have to do is to have an  American hostage; threaten to murder that hostage in response to some  unbearable Israeli "provocation," and then murder him. Or, if you have already  murdered him before the provocation took place, you can produce the proof of  the murder after the provocation. Either way, you have produced an effective  tap on that wedge.  </P> <P> Proof of that was provided by Sen. Bob Dole, just after the announcement of the  hanging of Higgins. The Dole statement in relation to Israel was the most  scathing made against Israel by any American political leader since 1957. And  1957 was far the worst year in the entire history of Israel-United States  relations, up to now.  </P> <P> Some observers think that Dole consulted President Bush before he made that  statement, and that his reference to Israel reflects the feelings of the  President as well as of the senator. If so, the government of Israel has cause  to be seriously worried, as I believe it now is.  </P> <P> In Iran and in Damascus, and at PLO headquarters, the strategists of the  struggle against Israel will have studied the Dole statement with close  attention. They will rightly interpret it as meaning there is marvelous  political mileage to be made out of murdering American hostages and keeping a  threat of murder suspended over other American hostages. A subtle variant is to  appear occasionally in the role of "protector" of the hostages held by your  clients.  </P> <P> The atrocity against Higgins, committed by the enemies of Israel, might have  enhanced American feelings of being "on the same side" as Israel, had the  circumstances been different. But as it is, things don't seem quite to be  working that way. The fact is that America does not appear to possess any  effective mode of action against the captors of the hostages. The dispatch of  U.S. warships to the eastern Mediterranean may perhaps impress a part of the  American public. But it doesn't impress any of the armed factions of Lebanon.  Those factions have seen American warships before. They have even seen American  Marines. And they have seen the departure of the warships, and of the Marines,  without their having accomplished anything whatever.  </P> <P> It is true there are things that could be done that would hurt Iran -- a  blockade of its oil exports, for example, but to do the things that would hurt  Iran would be much more likely to result in more murders of American hostages  than in their release. So that option is not worth much either. There may yet  be some American military response to the hostage situation. But if there is,  it is quite unlikely to do the hostages any good, whatever else it may do.  </P> <P> Some of the American frustration at this specific incapacity of its enormous  material strength is bound to vent itself on Israel, for having provided the  incident that led to the demonstration of this incapacity and to death. But  Israel is also the only country involved over which the United States has the  capacity to exert serious pressure. That pressure can be effective if it is  sufficiently motivated and sustained. I believe it is likely to be so, in time,  in the case of Sheik Obeid.  </P> <P> I believe that Israel is likely, under pressure from the United States, to  release Obeid unconditionally, contrary to Israel's current intention. But I  don't believe that release of the sheik will undo the damage done by his  capture, and the responses to his capture. On the contrary, it is likely to  compound that damage. Unconditional release of the sheik, in current  circumstances, would provide certain proof that the holding of hostages on the  threat to kill them -- a threat made credible by occasional killing -- are  highly effective political weapons in the war against Israel. That lesson will  not soon be forgotten. It is not conducive to a general release of hostages.  </P> <P> The release of the sheik would no doubt nullify those threats against hostages  that have been ostensibly based on the sheik's imprisonment, but other threats  will follow, supposedly caused after other "provocations" by Israel. And Israel  has really no choice but to continue to supply such provocations. It may well  in future avoid such high level "spectaculars" as the kidnaping of the cleric,  which had such untoward political results. But it has to defend itself against  the guerrilla war waged against it by the Hezbollah and its allies.  </P> <P> Every act of self-defense, on Israel's part, will be seen by the Hezbollah as a  provocation. And the more successful any such act is, the more unbearable the  provocation will be. That being so, the Hezbollah is likely to make repeated  use of its not-so-secret weapon: the American hostages. The repercussions in  America, in relation to Israel, seem likely to be similar to those reflected in  the Dole statement, but getting progressively worse.  </P> <P> Some well-meaning commentators have drawn from the whole affair the moral that  it is urgent to get on with "the peace process," which is assumed capable of  producing general harmony in the Middle East (so resulting in, among other good  things, the release of all the hostages). The Bush Administration may well draw  the same moral. It may well increasingly interpret "the peace process" in an  Arab sense: meaning a Palestinian state in the territories currently occupied  by Israel.  </P> <P> If things develop that way, Israel will be placed in an appalling position. It  will be under heavy pressure, from its sole and indispensable ally, to do  things incompatible with its survival. To hand over the territories, to anyone,  would mean a serious danger of civil war inside Israel. Jewish settlers in the  territories, who are now numerous, would have to be uprooted by force. Many of  them would put up armed resistance and would be supported by about half the  population of Israel and of the defense forces. Israel's continued existence  would be at stake.  </P> <P> A "Palestinian state" would mean creation of a second Lebanon on Israel's  borders. The Palestinian state, if and when it exists, is supposed to be  administered by "the PLO." But the PLO is no more than a name for a number of  diverse and conflicting factions; some would continue the armed struggle  against Israel out of any territory that might be handed over, irrespective of  any agreements that might be concluded in the name of "the PLO."  </P> <P> So Israel, having handed over territory, at the cost of an agonizing internal  crisis, would not get any peace in exchange. But the cost of rejecting  "territory for peace" indefinitely and without a credible alternative might  include loss of the American alliance.  </P> <P> If Israel is to weather the storms that lie ahead, the Dayan dictum must cease  to apply. Israel needs a foreign policy, as well as a defense policy -- and  needs it urgently.  </P></p>

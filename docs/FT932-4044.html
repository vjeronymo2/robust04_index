			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Washington focuses on six difficult sectors SIX sectors are emerging as the US focus in tough US-Japan trade talks, to begin in Washington today, along with a general conviction that Japan must be brought to make a serious commitment to reduce its overall current account surplus. The six sectors, comprising 65 per cent of Japanese exports to the US, are: cars, car parts, computers, supercomputers, electronics and semiconductors. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, noted these are the areas where US companies have had difficulty penetrating the Japanese market, despite many previous negotiations and agreements. The lone exception seems to be semiconductors, where the Japanese last year surprised everyone by surpassing an agreed 20 per cent target for foreign penetration. This brought the Clinton administration to a view that 'results-oriented (pacts) work'. A target of sorts was agreed for the US auto parts sector last year, during President George Bush's ill-fated trip to Tokyo. The deal included a commitment by Japanese automakers to more than double their purchases of US-made car parts to Dollars 19bn by 1994. Real progress on cars and car parts is considered vital. Of the Dollars 50bn US trade deficit with Japan, vehicles and vehicle parts account for Dollars 30bn. About Dollars 10bn of of that is car parts. In the US, American parts companies have been losing business while Japanese car transplants buy from Japanese parts transplants. This may have begun to change. Toyota has increased its purchases of parts in the US by 40 per cent, Nissan by 60 per cent. Mr Kantor has acknowledged that the Japanese 'have opened it to some degree with the transplants.' Purchases are running at about Dollars 12-13bn a year. However, US Commerce Department figures do not distinguish between purchases from US parts-makers and Japanese transplants. 'We were supposed to have a concentration on traditional (American) US auto parts suppliers,' Mr Kantor said, 'and we believe that has not taken place to the degree that it should.' The US also will want to go past numerical considerations and on to examining Japanese competition policy of the sort which keeps out foreign car dealers.</p>

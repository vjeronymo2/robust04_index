			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Kim Chang-yong] </F>   [Text] Top business leaders are knocking at the door of  the Chinese market in time for President Kim Yong-sam's visit  starting tomorrow, as they did in the past to create favorable  atmospheres for presidential trips.    Kim Yong-won, chairman of Jindo Corp., and Kim Chae-sop of  Youngchang Akki Co., a leading musical instrument maker, left  for China yesterday.    Chairmen Pak Yong-kon of the Doosan Group, Chang Chi-hyok of  the Kohap group and Yi Chun-yong of Daelim Industrial Co. are  scheduled to fly to China today.    Bigger names including chairmen Chong Se-yong of the Hyundai  group, Kim U-chung of the Daewoo group, Kim Sok-won of the  Ssangyong group and executive vice chairman Cho Kyu-ha of the  Federation of Korean Industries will follow in their steps this  weekend.    Their visits are in the form of individual, personal trips  as  Chongwadae banned them from accompanying President Kim to show  the severance between power and business. But all of them will  join the president at two dinners in China, officials said.    Their headlong rush reflects their high hopes that Kim's  visit may clear the way for closer economic and business ties  with China, a socialist giant and emerging economic power. It  contrasts with the presence of a few businessmen during his  Japan visit.    Hyundai will move vigorously to get the Chinese central  government to approve its plan to establish a joint venture  company in Dairen capable of producing 300,000 autos a year.    It will also lobby Beijing to win a bid for the construction  of a 1.5 billion-dollar multipurpose dam in Hainan, a Hyundai  executive said. Hyundai, Korea's largest conglomerate with  interests ranging from construction, to autos, is studying the  feasibility of participating in a 20 billion-dollar project to  build a dam on the Yangtse estuary.    Daewoo expects that it will sign a contract to set up a 1.5  billion-dollar auto assembly plant in a joint venture with a  Changchun, northern China, company with an annual production  capacity of 300,000 units.    Daewoo has already presented a letter of intent in regard to  that project under which it hopes to begin producing engines and  other components in 1996 and fully-assembled cars two years  later, according to its spokesman.    The Samsung and Lucky-Goldstar groups are leaning toward the  telecommunications service area as China is considering Korea's  total digital exchange system as the model for its network.    The Sunkyong and Ssangyong groups hope that the presidential  visit, which entails various levels of talks between Cabinet  ministers, ranking officials and businessmen, will be a boon to  their projects.    Sunkyong and Ssangyong, the fifth and sixth chaebols, are  seeking the Chinese government's go-ahead to their plans for a  1.5 billion- dollar oil refinery in Shenzen and a huge cement  plant capable of producing 600,000 tons, respectively.</p>

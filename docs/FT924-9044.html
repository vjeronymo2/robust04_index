			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Higher dollar takes the credit for continental gains THE HIGHER dollar got the credit for gains in a number of bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT edged up again, apparently encouraged by a further gain in the dollar, but the share price effects sometimes defied logic as the DAX index rose 6.23 to 1,487.16, a fraction lower on the week. A higher dollar should benefit Germany's exporters, and Schering, in pharmaceuticals, rose DM12.20 to DM736.50. But the big three chemical companies were relatively flat and carmakers no more buoyant than the average. Conversely, a rise in the dollar should be bad news for steelmakers which pay for their iron ore and transport in dollar terms, said Mr Michael Geiger of County NatWest; but Mannesmann, after takeover rumours, Preussag (following Thursday's earnings upgrade) and Thyssen all rose yesterday, by DM5.70 to DM210.50, DM6 to DM330 and DM5.80 to DM 158 respectively. Turnover fell from DM4.2bn to DM3.7bn. There was a suggestion that short-covering, once again, was involved in the day's rises and that poor economic data and depressed underlying sentiment was more clearly reflected in retailing shares which mostly showed falls of some 1 to 3 per cent. MILAN ended mixed as a leaked government document on privatisation, which included a comprehensive list of companies scheduled to be sold off, triggered heavy speculative trading in selected stocks. The Comit index rose 3.28 to 432.77, down 1.4 per cent on the week, in turnover estimated at more than Thursday's L177bn. Of those companies mentioned in the document, the bank BCI rose L181 or 5.3 per cent to L3,625 while Autostrade preferred stock jumped L46 or 6.1 per cent to L794. Sme, the state-controlled food company which has been touted as a privatisation candidate but which did not appear in the leaked document, rose L51 or 1.1 per cent to L4,871. Speculative trading spilled over into the retailer Rinascente, settlement in which was delayed because of an order imbalance early in the session following rumours that its parent Fiat had agreed to sell it. Fiat denied the rumors, but Rinascente's share price rallied 11 per cent or L595 to L5,995. PARIS was brought off the day's high by a series of basket trades around midday. After an early high of 1,812.83, the CAC-40 index ended 11.08 down at 1,793.62, for a rise of 2.9 per cent on the week. Volume was moderate at FFr2.5bn. Total dropped FFr5.50 to FFr239.50 as the oil company's disclosure that restructuring and asset writedowns would reduce 1992 earnings by about FFr600m took the market by surprise. BSN dropped FFr22 to FFr1,002 on a downgrade by a leading broker, while LVMH fell FFr160 or 4.3 per cent to FFr3,579 on fears that a trade war between Europe and the US would harm its exports to the US. BRUSSELS saw a further heavy fall in Delhaize which plunged BFr99 or 6.2 per cent to BFr1,486 in heavy trading, reflecting a drop in the shares of its US Food Lion unit in New York after the showing on US television of an unauthorised film shot at the US chain. The Bel-20 index fell 11.68 to 1,134.47, but was little changed on the week. AMSTERDAM was helped by a firmer dollar as the CBS Tendency index rose 0.8 to 103.4, up 1.8 per cent on the week. Unilever fell Fl 2.00 to Fl 190.10, following its London price lower after its third quarter results which, said dealers, were disappointing in sterling terms. ZURICH extended its show of relative strength as the SMI index rose 6.2 to 1,957.7, 2.4 per cent higher on the week. Strong demand for Nestle and Roche boosted the index, while other export-oriented companies also benefited from the dollar. MADRID heard more peseta devaluation talk, but the strength of the dollar lent support to ADR stocks and the general index closed only 0.76 lower at 199.16, slightly up on the week. STOCKHOLM was also supported by the dollar as the Affarsvarlden General index rose 1.7 to 724.2, up 2.4 per cent on the week. HELSINKI dropped 3.4 per cent, but still showed a gain of 6.5 per cent on the week as the Hex index closed 27.9 lower at 799.7. Banks fell sharply, partly on an article in a business daily on the possible risk involved in holding the shares. The banks and finance house index closed 112.5 or 25 per cent lower at 335.6.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- November 6                                         THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                Open       10.30      11.00      12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1038.85     1037.76    1037.81    1038.66 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1110.74     1110.34    1108.50    1106.74  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                              13.00       14.00      15.00      Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1039.43     1039.97    1038.29    1038.28 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1109.76     1111.68    1112.07    1111.70  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Nov 5     Nov 4     Nov 3     Nov 2    Oct 30  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1038.93   1037.06   1038.76   1032.82   1028.47 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1109.13   1105.82   1105.49   1095.06   1090.07  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1041.21; 200 - 1113.28 Low/day: 100 - 1036.99  200 - 1106.74  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

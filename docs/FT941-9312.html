			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Survey of Housing Associations (1): From philanthropy to business - Born in the age of Victorian idealism, housing associations are now an influential factor in the UK housing market and are increasingly entrepreneurial and business oriented Housing associations, once small-scale providers of specialist housing, have become social businesses playing a leading role in the UK housing market. They remain voluntary bodies, governed by management boards made up of unpaid volunteers. Yet the largest associations now own tens of thousands of homes with assets worth hundreds of millions of pounds. Since the 1988 Housing Act, associations have increasingly drawn on private finance to augment government grants for providing affordable housing. They have borrowed around Pounds 4.5bn in that period, both in direct investment and through a growing range of club deals and intermediaries. A similar sum will be required over the next three years to fund their continuing expansion plans. 'The growth of private finance has been an undoubted success story,' says Mr David Burnett of Samuel Montagu, the merchant bank. 'The variety of instruments and the spread of investors which has been achieved in such a short period is quite remarkable.' Housing associations have also become much more entrepreneurial, according to Mr Don Wood, chief executive of London &amp; Quadrant Housing Trust, one of the largest associations managing 17,000 homes in London and the south-east. His association has built new partnerships with local authorities and urban regeneration bodies to make its government grant stretch as far as possible. Growth since the 1988 Act means that associations now manage about 900,000 homes, approaching 4 per cent of Great Britain's housing stock. While this is less than a fifth of the number owned by local authorities, it will continue to grow for the foreseeable future. With almost no new development by local authorities, they have become the main providers of new low-cost homes for rent or sale. In recent years, they have provided an average of more than 50,000 new homes annually. In many parts of the country, associations are also taking over local authority housing stock through voluntary transfers. In five years, they have assumed responsibility for 130,000 such homes on behalf of 28 local authorities. Another 12 transfers involving 50,000 homes are in the pipeline for next year. The government has also encouraged associations to play a much wider role on the housing market, particularly in managing property for private landlords. It also sees associations winning a large share of the Pounds 1.25bn a year market in managing local authority housing, due to go out to compulsory competitive tendering in 1996. And it was the housing associations that the government turned to when it launched the housing market rescue package in the 1992 autumn statement. In just 93 working days, 81 associations pumped Pounds 577m into buying 18,430 homes in England from developers, private sellers and mortgage lenders to let to the homeless. In meeting these new challenges, associations are becoming much more sophisticated in their operations, under the watchful eye of the Housing Corporation which this week stages a conference in Brighton to celebrate its 30th birthday. The Corporation acts as regulator and distributes government grant to associations in England. It has also encouraged the movement to improve the quality of its management and to learn new financial skills. Mr Anthony Mayer, chief executive of the Corporation, is keen to get more business people involved on the committees which run associations. 'Associations have become massive private sector businesses involved in delivering a public service,' he says. 'The more people we can get with business acumen, the better.' The next few years may be rather tougher however. The greatest challenge will come from the decline in the amount of the government housing association grant. The Housing Corporation's budget is due to fall from a record Pounds 2.3bn last year to Pounds 1.45bn in 1995-96. To maximise the number of homes this declining grant provides, the government has been ratcheting down the rate of the grant from 75 per cent of the cost of a new home to 62 per cent. By 1995-96, the target grant rate is 55 per cent. Associations must borrow the balance of the cost on the capital markets and that could become harder as the grant rate falls. Standard procedures for valuing tenanted homes mean that investors are normally unwilling to lend 45 per cent of the cost of a home solely against the security of that home. Other assets must be pledged to raise finance. 'Only the financially strongest housing associations will be able to continue to develop over the next few years,' says Mr George Barlow, director of the Peabody Trust, one of 20 biggest associations. The trust, founded in 1862 by a the wealthy American banker George Peabody, has inherited mansion blocks in central London locations such as Chelsea and Westminster. With such a strong asset base, it was the first housing association to issue debenture stock on the strength of its own covenant and without a government guarantee. But many other associations have little or no additional security to pledge. This is particularly so for the newer specialist associations set up to cater for ethnic minorities and other special housing needs. 'The result will be an increasingly monochrome future,' according to Mr Giles Goddard of Southwark Diocesan housing association, which has provided 65 homes on former church land in south London. The diversity offered by smaller associations such as his will be squeezed out, he fears, as grant rates fall. Even some larger associations have limited scope to find additional security for loans, says Mr David Hucker of the Coventry-based Orbit Housing Association. 'Reserves can only be spent once,' he says. 'At a time when associations need strong balance sheets and cashflows to encourage investor confidence, this draining of their collateral will ultimately be to their detriment.' A further consequence of falling government grant rates is higher rents. If a higher proportion of the cost of a new home has to be borrowed, then there is a higher interest charge to be passed on to the tenant. Data collected by the National Federation of Housing Associations shows that rents have increased 150 per cent since 1988. During this period tenants' incomes have risen by just a third. If the tenant is unemployed, the rent will be paid by the Department of Social Security through housing benefit. But the tenant is then stuck in a poverty trap which is a deterrent to taking employment. Up to 96 per cent of each extra Pounds 1 of income the tenant earns can be clawed back as benefits are withdrawn - leaving the tenant little better off, or even worse off after allowing for child-care and work-related costs. 'With rents rising faster than tenants' incomes, the poverty trap is widening,' says Mr Jim Coulter, director of the federation. 'Accepting a job paying around average earnings can leave a parent with two children worse off at the sort of rent levels which are now required.' Such concerns were crystallised last year with the publication of a report by Mr David Page, a housing consultant. He said that government policy was encouraging associations to recreate the conditions which had turned so many large local authority estates into housing disasters. On the one hand falling grant rates were driving associations to build larger, high-density estates to cut costs. On the other, rising rents were turning these estates into 'welfare ghettos', largely populated by people on benefits. 'The combination of unfavourable dwelling mix and very disadvantaged new tenants has produced a seriously unbalanced population mix on new estates,' the report concluded. The result could be soulless estates plagued by crime, inhabited only by those with no choice in their housing. Such predictions may turn out to be unduly pessimistic. The publication of the Page report has had a salutary effect on the movement, serving as a warning of what will happen if the pressures it identifies are not adequately addressed. But it set off alarm bells which indicate that there is no cause for complacency in the movement. The leading role that housing associations have successfully taken in the provision of social housing will bring new challenges in the years to come.</p>

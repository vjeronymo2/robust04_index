			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Shares look vulnerable to change in tack - London Volatility has become more than a keyword for describing the mood on the UK stock market. Daily swings in share prices have reached proportions where they not only reflect underlying factors but also influence prospects for the market's performance over the final quarter of the year. Last week, the FT-SE 100 Share Index moved through a range of around 80 points in terms of intra-day highs and lows, before closing on Friday with a 54 point gain on the week. Since many market strategists would probably settle, at least privately, for a year-end Footsie anywhere above 3,300, moves of 80 points are not to be brushed aside just because they have not proved sustainable. Volatility is related directly to the dismal volume of business in the UK equity market. Equity bargains are running at around 25,000 daily, comparing either with Christmas holiday sessions or, more ominously, with early July this year when the Footsie was hitting its 1994 low. Daily bargains are only around two-thirds of the average for the past two years, so the rumours regularly sweeping the trading rooms that leading houses are poised for wide-ranging staff cuts or even withdrawals from market sectors are hardly surprising. Low volume is hitting the market in two ways. Market-makers concentrate on keeping trading books on a tight rein, and are unwilling to hold positions; and at the first sign of a change in sentiment, stock flies round the market and prices move sharply. Such volatility makes programme trading, once every market trader's dream, extremely hazardous. The securities house taking on a programme must effectively buy the portfolio on offer and then turn to the market to unwind its position. It takes the risk that at least some stocks may prove difficult to unload. The past few months have seen a number of large houses, including at least one US investment bank, badly caught out and sustaining heavy losses when the market suddenly dropped before a programme could be unwound. Misfortunes for market-makers and securities houses are not necessarily negative for the market or for share prices, except in an immediate sense. Kleinwort Benson points out this week that institutional activity is light and that this leaves share prices highly vulnerable to any turn to the bullish tack. Unfortunately, as some observers admit, events in the US have revived the prospect that UK base rates may have to go up before the end of the year, rather than in the new year when such a development would apparently be acceptable in the market. This effectively leaves London dependent on the US and German bond markets.</p>

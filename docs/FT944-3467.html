			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Stanhope asks for standstill on debt Stanhope, the property developer on the brink of collapse, will today ask banks, meeting to decide its future, for a debt standstill of up to three years. The company was last night trying to arrange a deal which would offer the banks full repayment of their Pounds 140m loans, with interest, at the end of a standstill period. Stanhope's existing loan facility runs out next Monday. The 16 banks led by Barclays must decide whether to appoint receivers or give the company more time to come up with a rescue package. The other rescue proposals for Stanhope come from British Land, the property investment company headed by Mr John Ritblat, and PosTel, the post and telecommunications pension fund run by Mr Alastair Ross Goobey. Both of these plans ask the banks to take a write-down of more than 20p in the pound on their loans. Stanhope's own proposal envisages the company's Pounds 5m-Pounds 10m a year running costs would be met during the standstill period by an unknown investor in return for an equity stake. The total cost of funding the company through the period would be Pounds 25m-Pounds 30m, against a market capitalisation of less than Pounds 20m. Before giving Stanhope more time to finalise the plan, the banks will want to know the identity of the investor and haveassurances of sufficient working capital. Stanhope's main asset is its 50 per cent stake in Broadgate Properties, which owns much of the Broadgate and Ludgate developments in the City of London. Broadgate Properties' accounts, published in October, valued its assets at Pounds 1bn and Stanhope's stake at Pounds 116m. Forecasts carried out for the company by Jones Lang Wootton, the surveyors, suggest that the value of Broadgate Properties' assets could rise to Pounds 1.4bn by June 1997. While this would allow Stanhope to repay its loans at the end of any standstill, assumptions about Broadgate's future value are based on forecasts of rents which could be wrong. Sources close to the talks yesterday said they expected the banks to give the company more time. Stanhope's shares fell by 3p to 10p yesterday.</p>

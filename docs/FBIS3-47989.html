This seminar entitled  "The Prospect for the North Korean Nuclear Issue and North-South  Relations" was sponsored by the party policy committee.    In the seminar, lawmaker Pak Sil said that "because there is  a possible breakthrough in the settlement of the nuclear issue  as a result of North Korea's acceptance of the nuclear  inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the  government must allow businessmen to visit North Korea."    He predicted that "because this year is the year in which  there is no election in South Korea, in which the Kim Yong-sam  government can strengthen its power, and in which North Korea  can consolidate the transfer of power from Kim Il-song to his  son, it is possible for the North and South to create conditions  for the North-South summit talks."</p>

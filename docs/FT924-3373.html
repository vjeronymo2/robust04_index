			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries rally persists after positive economic data US TREASURY prices firmed yesterday as investors continued to interpret recent strong economic data in a positive light. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/8 at 101 31/32 , yielding 7.454 per cent. The two-year note was also notably firmer, up  3/16 at 100 1/16 , yielding 4.574 per cent. Although good economic news is normally bad for the market, investors have welcomed the recent signs of strength because they believe it reduces the chances that president-elect Clinton will introduce an aggressive package of fiscal stimuli in his first few months. During and immediately after the election campaign the bond market's biggest fear was that a heavy programme of government spending by a Democratic administration would widen the Federal budget deficit and push up interest rates and prices. Those fears are now abating, although the underlying concern about an overheated economy and widened deficit still exists. UK government bond prices drifted lower across the yield curve as the release of the latest credit figures dashed hopes of a cut in interest rates. Dealers said the UK credit figures, which showed a Pounds 76m rise in the amount of credit outstanding by British consumers, provided a slightly more bullish picture of the UK economy, with the result that hopes of a base rate cut faded. The Liffe gilt futures contract fell from 99.18 at the opening to 99.07 by late afternoon on relatively low volume of around 15,500 contracts. In the cash market, short-dated gilts fell by over a quarter of a point, with the 10 per cent gilt due 1994 dropping from 104 21/32 to 104 11/32 to yield 6.91 per cent. The 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 slipped from 108 29/32 to 108 21/32 , resulting in a flattening of the yield curve. French government bonds weakened on reports of an imminent devaluation of the French franc and worse-than-expected money supply figures, but ended the day little changed. The devaluation press reports were denied later in the day. French M3 money supply grew by 0.2 per cent in October, giving year-on-year growth of 5.7 per cent - compared with 5.3 per cent in September. The Bank of France has a target of 4 to 6 per cent for annual M3 growth in 1992. The yield on the 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2023 opened at 8.67 per cent and traded at around 8.70 per cent by late afternoon. On the Matif futures exchange in Paris, the December bond futures contract closed at 110.18, up 0.12 from late Friday. German government bonds drifted lower in thin trade ahead of Thursday's Bundesbank Council meeting, with the Liffe bund future contract slipping from 91.72 to 91.52 by late afternoon. Dealers said bunds opened on a relatively firm note following Sunday's Swiss referendum vote, which rejected a plan for a European Economic Area and led to some uncertainty about tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism. Reports in the German press that half of the Bundesbank Council members are in favour of a cut in interest rates also helped to give the bund market a push early in the session, but prices later drifted lower. Swiss franc bonds ended higher, ignoring the decision by Swiss voters to reject the European Economic Area treaty in the weekend referendum. Dealers said the recovery in the Swiss Franc against the D-Mark helped to lift bond prices. Japanese government bonds ended slightly firmer, helped by lower money market rates and hopes of a cut in the Official Discount Rate. The yield on the benchmark No 145 traded in a narrow range of between 4.585-4.60 per cent. In the futures market, the March contract ended at 107.81, up from Friday's close of 107.74. Dealers said the market was hoping to see a cut in the Official Discount Rate, especially as Friday's quarterly Tankan report on business confidence is expected to show that the Japanese economy is still in a weak state. The unsecured overnight call money rate slipped  1/32 to 3 27/32 per cent yesterday, and dealers are waiting to see whether some of the commercial banks will follow Sanwa Bank's example and cut their short-term prime rates.</p>

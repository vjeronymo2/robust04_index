			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Without Confirmation" column by Alfonso Baella] </F>   [Text] The new Constitution provides for a new electoral  system that comprises the National Elections Board, the National  Electoral Processes Office [Oficina Nacional de Procesos  Electorales], and the Identity and Civil Status National  Registry [Registro Nacional de Identificacion y Estado Civil].    Supposedly, the Constitution must be respected. Therefore,  this system should already have been implemented -- as  established by the Constitution itself -- and planning,  organization, and execution of the electoral processes,  referendum, or other type of consultations begun, as well as the  maintenance and custody of a single registry of the peoples'  identity and a registry of acts that modify people's civil  status.    It all looks great in theory but in practice we find that we  are in the wake of an electoral process -- nothing less than  presidential and congressional elections -- and there is not  enough time left to implement this entire mechanism.    What can be done about it?    Fulfill the terms of the Constitution word for word as some  maintain, although this may entail that in the end -- now that  election day is almost here -- one component or another of the  electoral system will not function?    Or should we, as others propose, amend the new Constitution  not more than three months after it was promulgated to  temporarily suspend the enforcement of the new electoral system  and thus let the National Electoral Board be in charge of the  next elections?    This, too, entails many risks.    What would happen if the Constitution Committee were to  approve the proposed constitutional amendment but the plenum  were to reject it. If there is little time left now, as of  April -- which is when the issue will be debated -- there will  be even less time.    But supposing the plenum approves it, this constitutional  reform would have to be submitted to a referendum -- under what  system? -- if it is not sanctioned in two successive ordinary  sessions with a favorable vote, in each case, more than  two-thirds of the legal number of congressmen.    Neither alternative seems the most convenient or feasible.    The thing then would be to find a solution within the  Constitution.    This solution is in a very brief final and transitory  article, the 11th, that states: "Constitutional provisions that  demand new and greater public expenditures will be applied  progressively."    Won't the establishment of the Electoral Process National  Office and the Identification and Civil Status Office demand  "new and greater public expenditures?"    If the answer is yes, then there will be no other choice  than  -- as the Constitution itself says -- to interpret (one of the  power's Congress has) the law in order to establish that these  two components of the new electoral system be "progressively"  established after the 1995 elections.    In the meantime, the National Electoral Board would be  responsible for the development of the presidential and  parliamentarian elections.    Another final and transitory article, the 10th, states: "The  law establishes how the offices, officials, and servants of the  Civil Status Registry of local government and of the Electoral  Registry will be incorporated into the Identity and Civil Status  National Registry."    Well, all we need is a law stating that this step should  take  place after the next elections.    These are two other subjects that legislators and  Constituent  Assembly members can discuss.</p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Demise of a battle-scarred veteran of the cold war - Nancy Dunne writes the obituary of a secretive group dedicated to keeping dangerous technology in the West Cocom, the secretive Paris-based group formed in 1947 to keep equipment and technology out of the hands of communist regimes, today will become history along with other cold war anachronisms. For weeks its members have been struggling to agree the shape and powers of a successor organisation. Because there was no agreement on this at a meeting of the 17 Cocom member nations in The Hague last night, the old lists of banned items will stay in place, with enforcement at the discretion of national governments. But it was agreed at The Hague that the successor to the Co-ordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls would control the export of dual use technology (such as computers, telecommunication equipment and chemicals) and conventional arms to 'rogue regimes' or to governments considered likely to develop or use weapons of mass destruction. The US also wants the new body to include only those countries, mostly in the industrialised world, that participate in the three other international proliferation control regimes: the Missile Technology Control Regime, the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Nuclear Suppliers Group. These were formed in the past ten years as it became clear the emphasis on export controls was shifting away from the perceived communist threat towards 'mavericks' such as Iran, Iraq and North Korea. Russia and other former Communist countries, which it had been thought might join, are unlikely to be in at the beginning, a move perhaps reflecting concern about the region's stability. However, their aid will be sought in the non-proliferation efforts, according to Mr William Reinsch, the commerce department under secretary in charge of US export controls. In contrast to its controversial passing, Cocom's birth was comparatively easy. The US had most of the world's advanced weapons and technology, and its companies had little interest in alien markets. Europe was still ravaged by war. Memories of the second world war were fresh and fed unity against the communist threat. Even as Europe and Japan recovered, Cocom had a virtual monopoly on commercial dual-use technologies. 'There was a common understanding and a political will to treat problem countries as a direct threat to Western security,' said Mr Reinsch. Cocom was a little known organisation when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979. The US learned then that trade weapons, when applied unilaterally, had their limits: when President Jimmy Carter slapped a wheat embargo on the Soviet Union, US allies and competitors took the market for themselves. Export licensing - more onerous in the US than elsewhere - was costing US companies contracts. They were being challenged everywhere by strong European and Japanese competitors. But in 1981, the Reagan Administration began to beef up enforcement of unilateral US controls and at the same time, it sought to strengthen Cocom. Mr Paul Freedenberg, a commerce department undersecretary at the time, says the US was 'overbearing and imperial' in its demands. The resentment which resulted may have sown the seeds of Cocom's demise. 'The problem is we do have some risks out there, and we need international co-operation,' says Mr Freedenberg. Countries - such as Iraq, North Korea and Iran - seeking to develop mass destruction capabilities can usually find other supplies or can manufacture the items themselves. 'It is useless to maintain long lists of controlled items when they are readily available from numerous suppliers outside the regimes,' says Mr Reinsch. Instead, he said, the US wants to focus on items which are critical for weapons and can be effectively blocked by multilateral co-operation. Mr David Earnest, of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, believes that what emerges after Cocom will be a weaker regime, whose members will be unable to veto other countries' exports. The successor is likely to control items on the basis of national discretion. Licences will remain the sole responsibility of the member states, which will not have to get prior approval from other members, says Mr Earnest. 'This will increase the disparities in enforcement,' said Mr Earnest. 'At least under the old system there was uniformity.' The list of controlled items will be narrowed considerably. Negotiators, working in The Hague, have agreed to maintain existing lists until they reach agreement on the new ones. Some critics believe Cocom moved too quickly to disband, that it could have survived with a shorter control list and preserved a united front. Despite assurances from the Commerce Department that the impact of the new regime on US exporters will be negligible, US business is worried that Washington may deny export licences that governments in competitor countries will approve. The Clinton Administration - at the insistence of the Pentagon and State Department - has de-cided to retain a system of unilateral controls. The US is still in withdrawal from its expensive habit of world leadership.</p>

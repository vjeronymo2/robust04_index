			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Arts: Betrayals of faith - Cinema LIFE ON A STRING ICA BLACK ROBE (15) Plaza, MGM Trocadero HORS LA VIE (15) Screen on the Hill, Cannon Tottenham Ct Rd MY GIRL (PG) Odeon Leicester Sq ZERO DE CONDUITE (U) and BOUDU SAVED FROM DROWNING (PG) Renoir To tell you that Life On A String is a Chinese film about the search for wisdom will not, I realise, cause a stampede to the box office. To many Westerners Chinese wisdom has much the same appeal as Chinese water torture: insistent, timeless, litanistic; wearing down resistance by its metronome certainty. Chen Kaige's film is, as it happens, masterly. But many filmgoers at Cannes last year felt stupefied, including the festival jury who left it prizeless. The maker of the ground-breaking Yellow Earth here gives us an old minstrel-saint and his young apprentice, both blind, leading each other across mountains, valleys and burnished terracotta deserts. They are in quest of - what? Our only clue is in the surreal prologue, set in an azure-hued limbo hung with white funerary tatters, in which the old man as a youngster receives his old master's dying wisdom. Something about the thousandth string breaking on his lute. Something about his only then finding the true way to sing. But this string is a long time a-breaking. 'Sixty years later,' as the caption tells us introducing the main story, the now ageing songster and his pupil are still only on about string 990 and their trek across China sets new standards for the word picaresque. One moment they are lingering by a waterfall-side cafe where a village idiot, a pretty girl and Buddha-like boss sketch archetypal figures we will meet and re-meet later. The next moment the two heroes are dots in a ravishing pattern of rift valleys. Later still they fetch up at a village where the boy's romance with a local girl - she giggles, she tumbles him in a haystack, she crumbles sunflowers over his head - plays havoc with the religious responsibilities of his calling. But it is those responsibilities that are on trial in Kaige's film. When the 'truths' that guide us through the story are finally revealed as fraudulent, we are as startled by this moral handstand as we are by the one in Mozart's Magic Flute. There, you recall, the man character-assassinated in Act 1 by the lady with the show-off aria turns out to be all-wise and good in the following acts. Life On A String, like the rival Chinese masterworks of Kaige's compatriot and one-time cameraman Zhang Yimou (Red Sorghum, Ju Dou), has caused flutters in the neo-Maoist hen coop now occupied by those responsible for Tiananmen Square. The film is a fable about dying dogmas - for religion read communism - and about the senility that passes for wisdom among those who legislate over our lives. The measured pace is vital to the movie's strategy. By spreading the glow of 'eternal truth' over so many miles and man-hours it lulls us with the opiate assurance of (seemingly) immutable dogma. Then with a snapped string all its own it shows the boy betrayed, the girl thrown to her doom and the old man, his own last mental chord broken, chirping into the void. There are some longueurs, though the film has been tightened by eight minutes since Cannes. And Eastern symbolism is not always accessible to Western powers of assimilation. But even to the most floundering Occidental such as myself, the film has a piercing beauty of image and richness of purpose. Black Robe is also about the faith that betrays. As directed with sombre majesty by Bruce Beresford of Driving Miss Daisy, novelist Brian Moore's tale of a 17th century Jesuit priest and his companions crossing 1,500 miles of Indian territory to relieve a far-flung fellow missionary is given a scenic ride through coldest Canada. Amid snowscapes that howl around our ears the scarce-known cast - only Lothaire Bluteau, formerly Jesus of Montreal, is familiar as the saint-faced hero - stumble across historic North America towards meaning or meaninglessness. Moore's novel was a Pilgrim's Progress for the post-Conradian age. For this group of men God was not waiting at the end of their journey: only a variety of Kurtz-like demons embodied in the snowstorms, the white-water rivers and the tribal savages who capture and torture them. The book could have made a rousing Hollywood romp with Richard Gere, say, swashbuckling in Jesuitic black against back-projected winterlands. Beresford instead plunges into the real wilderness and gives the story a lyric nastiness worthy of Werner Herzog. In a calm woodland an Indian arrow suddenly pierces a white man's neck. A capering yellow-faced dwarf rattles a charm instrument at our hero. An aged Indian has a prophetic vision of the island we will soon see him die on. And everywhere the scenic textures are rough as sackcloth when not white as death. Perhaps the final icy laughter of Aguirre, Wrath Of God does not ring out. And whenever it seems about to, we are warmed by the gorgeous chords of Georges Delerue's music. But Black Robe is a brave film: not just for the physical daring of taking the story into the wild, but for the moral daring of questioning God, doubting grace and giving us pre-Kevin Costner Indians who are every bit as mad, bad and unpredictable as record rather than revision suggests. With a loud bump we come down to Maroun Bagdadi's Hors La Vie. This French-Italian-Belgian movie about hostage-taking is an assembly-kit political thriller. In a moment of madness the Cannes jury that ignored Life On A String gave it a Special Jury Prize. Perhaps they liked the telegraphic simplicity of its story, wherein a young French reporter (Hippolyte Girardot) kidnapped by Arab terrorists in Beirut is passed from one safe house to the next while we tick off director Bagdadi's shopping list of Essential Scenes. These include the hero horrified by the cries of an unseen fellow prisoner; the video message he is forced to record for the world; the leaden, tendentious exchanges between East and West ('You're a lucky man - you've a pretty girlfriend, you're rich, handsome, French'); and the frequent dashes from house to house, with the hero in one instance dressed as a woman. I found myself wishing the woman were Sally Field and we were back with the gutsy melodrama of Not Without My Daughter. Though based on real-life photographer Roger Auque, this hero and his story are played and scripted with no vitalising particularity at all, as if he were Everyman in Every-Troublespot. In My Girl an undertaker's little daughter (Anna Chlumsky) comes to terms with life and death in early-1970s Pennsylvania. Judging from the audience around me on the film's opening day in Los Angeles, you will need 300 soft tissues as little Miss Chlumsky loves and loses little Master Macaulay Culkin (Home Alone's hero, here introspective in specs) and comes to realise that her father Dan Aykroyd is a human being too, even though he spends so much time in the basement beautifying corpses. Set in the era of Nixon, Vietnam and the sexual revolution, the film counterpoints the girl's early discovery of life's dark side with her Dad's belated discovery of its fun side. He falls for cosmetologist Jamie Lee Curtis, who flirts and giggles with him and tells him caringly 'Life isn't just death, Harry.' The audience is not sure where life ends and creative death begins. You need wellington boots to wade through the film's slushy music and you goggle in disbelief at Master Culkin's wet and winsome cameo, which must be an early bid to outwit the typecasters by the now Dollars 4m-a-picture superbrat. Some touching truths do slither into prominence late in the film and I did some eye-dabbing myself around scene 167. But the film melts in the mind soon after it has melted parts of your heart. Laurice Elehwany wrote the screenplay; the director was Howard Zieff. Why not a classic French double-bill instead? Two influential films for the price of one. Jean Vigo's poetic hymn to schooldays and anarchy Zero De Conduite inspired Lindsay Anderson's If and Jean Renoir's Boudu Sauve Des Eaux, in which an endearingly disgusting tramp (Michel Simon) upends the lives of a rich couple, went to Hollywood to become Down And Out In Beverly Hills. If you liked the copies, the originals are even better.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [By reporter Mun Hyong-nam: "Corporate Aid to Universities </F> on the Increase; Grants of 30 Major Groups Reached 100 Billion  Won in 1993"]    [Text] As they say, "universities and businesses are  interdependent."    Universities' role for business communities is to provide  them with fresh blood--human resources and theoretical bases for  Research and Development [R&amp;D]. Korean business communities,  preoccupied with the immediate, day-to-day developments, indeed  had been somewhat negligent of their obligations to help  universities, but lately they have become increasingly conscious  of the importance of the role of universities and have stepped  up various types of assistance to further industry-university  cooperation, including financial aid to research programs and  expansion of facilities as well as scholarships.    It was found that the total amount of aid to universities by  the nation's 30 major business groups, including scholarships,  research and facility funds, and other endowments, last year  reached 100 billion won [W]. A survey conducted by CHUGAN  MAEGYONG indicates that l7 of them disbursed a total of W91.87  billion in aid to universities in 1993. Considering all other  firms, however minor, and cases of inadvertent omission, the  total amount is estimated at W100 billion.    The Daewoo Group topped the list with W30.4 billion,  followed  by Hyundai, W22.3 billion; Hanjin, W19.6 billion; Kumho, W5.78  billion; Lucky-Goldstar, W3.03 billion; Samsung, W2.1 billion;  Sunkyong, W2.09 billion; Kia, 1.63 billion; and Lotte W1.25  billion.    Of the total aid, W30.98 billion went to facilities and  W25.62 billion to research, while W22.08 billion went to  endowments and contributions and W13.19 billion to scholarships.  In the past, corporate aid mainly took the form of scholarships;  nowadays, however, long-term support--that is, building of  facilities, research funds for professors, endowments, and  scholarships in that order--forms the mainstream. The survey  found scholarships the lowest of all in weight. Also,  industry-university cooperation such as joint research programs  is moving ahead vigorously and in full swing.  <H5>  Daewoo at Top With W30.4 Billion </H5>   The survey clearly indicates that such corporate aid is  concentrated on a limited number of universities including those  linked with business groups, Seoul National University [SNU] and  a few others.    Of Daewoo's W25.9 billion from its group fund, W16 billion  went to Aju University, while in Hanjin's case, of the W19.56  billion in aid to facilities funds, W16.43 billion went to Inha  University Hospital and the Inha school system. Except for  universities linked to particular business firms, SNU received  the largest support, including W2 billion from Lucky-Goldstar,  W1 billion from Hyundai and Kia respectively, W120 million from  Kumho, and W90 million from Sunkyong--all as funds for school  development or additional building projects.    Of all the business groups, Daewoo runs the largest  university aid program. At the group level, it has, since 1991,  disbursed more than W20 billion in annual aid, increasing the  amount every year. The grants last year totalled W25.9 billion,  and a 12-percent or W29 billion increase is planned for this  year. Separate from Daewoo Group, Daewoo Foundation distributes  W4-W5 billion every year in scholarship and research funds. So,  the total Daewoo grants are expected to increase from W30.4  billion in 1993 to W33 billion in 1994.  <H5>  Aid Focused on Certain Universities Including SNU </H5>   Affiliated firms of the Hanjin Group disbursed W19.6 billion  last year--W40 million in scholarships and W19.56 billion in  contributions to facilities funds. Hanjin scholarship grants are  concentrated on group-related universities such as the Aviation  College, Inha University, and Inha Engineering College. Of the  W19.56 billion grants to facilities funds, W14.9 billion went to  Inha University Hospital and W1.53 billion to the Inha school  system. The group is planning a 68-percent increase in its aid  this year, bringing the total to W32.87 billion. Of the planned  grants, W26 billion will be to the Inha University Hospital  building fund.    The Kumho Group last year contributed W140 million to  scholarship programs, W120 million to the SNU development fund,  and W20 million to the Hanguk General Arts School development  fund. Also noteworthy is W5.5 billion it appropriated in aid to  the 1993 operations of the Kwangju Institute of Science and  Technology. Group Chairman Pak Song-yong has been promoting  Kumho's positive aid to the institute as chairman of the  preparatory committee for its founding in the past and as its  board member now.    The Lucky-Goldstar Group scholarship program is for 150  selected students every year, paying their registration fees in  full and giving each W300,000 to pay for training aids. The  expenses come to approximately W300 million per annum. Also,  under an overseas training program, the group selects 25  professors every year providing them with $20,000 each. The  annual cost of this program is approximately W400 million. In  particular, the group has been vigorously promoting  industry-university cooperation. For example, it granted  research funds to Kyongsang and Inha universities which  participated in the development of a refrigerator for Korean  pickle jars. Also, it added the Industry-University Cooperation  division to the Group's R&amp;D awards to honor professors of the  two universities.    The Samsung Group spent W4.2 billion in 1990 to build the  Hoam Hall for use by the SNU faculty as living quarters and for  research purposes. In 1992, it built for SNU a W3.5 billion  joint research center for new computer technology. But it made  no major contributions last year, except for a W1 billion grant  to Kyongbuk and Chonnam universities each as the local  university development fund.    The Sunkyong Group gave the "SNU Yukong Laboratory" of the  SNU chemical engineering school W86 million every year for 10  years through 1993 to promote joint research between industry  and the university. The group also decided to grant the Hanyang  University engineering school a total of W6 billion to help  expand its facilities, delivering the second installment of W2  billion last year.    In the Kia Group, Kia Motors Corp. pays the full  registration  fees for 40 to 50 students every year and, in addition, provides  them with tuition subsidies under industry-university  scholarship programs. As industry-university cooperation funds,  it gave Hanyang and Sogang universities W300 million each last  year. It also contributed W1 billion to the extension work of  the SNU engineering school, and W30 million to the support fund  for Tongguk University. Kia plans to gradually increase its aid  in both the number of recipients and the amount of money they  receive.    The Lotte Group, which had decided to grant the Pusan  University engineering school W3 billion for its development,  delivered W1 billion of it to the university last year. Also,  the Samnam Scholarship Association of the Group last year  distributed W100 million for scholarships for university  students and W150 million to support professors' research  activities.

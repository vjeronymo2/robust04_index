			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Argentina Share prices in Buenos Aires closed 3.6 per cent down yesterday, wiping out nearly all the gains made last week, writes John Barham. The Merval index finished at 680.71. Investors were unnerved by Wall Street's fall on Friday and the government's weekend announcement that it intends to remove tax privileges for the financial sector. This would make income on shares, bonds and bank deposits liable to a 0.5 per cent tax. Shares have not suffered a similar reverse since February 1993, when prices fell 6 per cent.</p>

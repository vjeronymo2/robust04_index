			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Political Analysis" column by Mazin Hammad: "Two Out of </F> Five"]    [Text] It is unprecedented for an Israeli official like  Yitzhaq Rabin to clearly state that there is no future for the  settlements in the occupied territories. Here he is promising  to remove the settlements within the framework of a final  settlement. He would not have said this if it was not for the  collapse of security Israel has been facing since the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre on 25 February. That massacre  opened the doors of revenge in Palestine like never before.  With bloody evidence, the massacre proved the impossibility of  coexistence between Arabs and Jews on one territory. Rabin is  fully aware of this result, which was in his mind when he told  the settlers yesterday that eventually they will have to leave.    The martyrdom operation in Hadera shook the faith of the  settlers in the possibility of staying in the West Bank and Gaza  and increased their motivation to pack their belongings and  dismantle their settlements. The timing of this operation was  well studied just like the timing of the 'Afula operation which  was carried out by Hamas a week ago, killing 13 Israelis and  wounding scores more.    The first operation marked 40 days since the martyrs of  Hebron. The second was carried out on Israeli Army day. It is  noteworthy that Hamas had previously vowed to carry out five  operations. This means that there are three operations on the  way.    Such operations not only remove the Israelis' sense of  security, but also reveal the impossibility of controlling a  decision by a movement such as Hamas to achieve martyrdom.  Moreover, as Rabin and Peres said yesterday, it is impossible  to seal the occupied territories when everyday, 10,000 cars come  from the West bank and Gaza to Palestine of 1948.    However, the more important question posed by the 'Afula and  Hadera operations is whether Israel has learned its lesson and  is now ready to achieve serious progress in the bilateral  negotiations with the Palestinians and other Arab parties. It  is totally clear that the Ibrahami Mosque massacre and the  aforementioned operations would not have occurred if Israel had  committed itself to starting withdrawal from "Gaza and Jericho  First" on 13 December as scheduled and completing this  withdrawal on 13 April; that is, yesterday.    Will 1.7 million Palestinians remain the prisoners of a few  thousand settlers, or must there be more martyrdom operations  before Israel sees the road in front of it?!</p>

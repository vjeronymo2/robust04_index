			<p>BFN     [Text] Thailand is partly to be blamed for the inflow of  HIV and AIDS to its neighbouring countries, Cambodia and Laos.    "Neighbouring Thailand has some of the highest HIV rates in  the world," said Cambodia's Public Health undersecretary Dr Uk  Ingkim in his report to an international conference this week.    The report was presented at the Technical Cooperation among  Developing Countries (TCDC) Inter-regional Symposium for  Capacity Enhancement in Primary Health Care and HIV/AIDS,  organised by the United Nations Development Programme.    Dr Ingkim said the challenge to Cambodia was formidable.    The political situation in the country remained unstable and  was characterised by large shifts in population, porous borders,  socio-economic disruption and limited public services.    According to his report, risky behaviour could be  characterised as primarily sexual.    Dr Ingkim said HIV was brought into the country mainly by  foreigners and repatriated refugees from Thailand.    "Commercial sex has grown rapidly since 1991, promoted by  economic liberalisation, an influx of foreign business, tourism,  relief and development personnel and the UN Peacekeeping Forces  (UNTAC)," said his report.    Dr Ingkim said it was estimated there were 2,000 commercial  sex workers in the capital and their number was growing  noticeably in economic centres and western provinces like ports  of Sihanoukville and Koh Kong.    The country report presented by Laos' HIV/AIDS Prevention  and  Control Programme coordinator Chanthon Sibounheuang stated that  an alarming incidence of HIV/AIDS in Thailand caused Laos to  believe it might soon face a similar situation.    "The opening of the Laotian economy and the completion of  the  Mekong River bridge between Thailand and Laos could lead to an  increase in HIV and AIDS," Dr Sibounheuang said.    His report also stated that most of the HIV positive cases  in  Laos were returnees and refugees from Thailand and bar workers,  many of them from provinces bordering Thailand.    As of December 1993, more than 15,000 HIV tests had been  conducted in Laos with a total of 38 persons diagnosed as HIV  positive.    To date only three AIDS cases have been reported.    The first round sentinel surveillance conducted last  October-December in five provinces, showed that out of 1,844  blood samples from different groups of students, military  recruits, bar workers, villagers, pregnant women and prisoners,  only three people were HIV positive and all three had returned  from Thailand, Laos's representative said.</p>

			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> POLICE STING AIMED AT ILLEGAL BOOZE SALES  </P> <P> The Police Department has announced plans for its second annual decoy program,  a sting aimed at stores and bars that sell liquor to minors.  </P> <P> This summer, on a random basis, young-looking Police Department workers will be  visiting stores and restaurants. If they are not asked for sufficient  identification, then the store will be cited for serving or selling liquor to  minors, Sgt. Andy Gonis said.  </P> <P> It is important for business owners to know that alcohol violations increase  during the summer, he said, and that by strictly checking identifications,  drunk-driving accidents can be reduced. LAURA MICHAELIS  </P></p>

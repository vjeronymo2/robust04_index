Zaveryukha of the RF Government flew to Smolensk for the 1994  Russian Wholesale Food Trade Fair. The vice premier's interest  in the fair is understandable. After all, it is taking place in  an atmosphere of budding market relations and essentially should  serve as the prototype of future business contacts between the  producers and buyers of food.    When the agrarian reform was being carried out, priority is  known to have been assigned to changes in forms of property  ownership and economic management. The problems of product sales  were virtually overlooked. In fact, to put it more precisely,  they were ignored.    It is not surprising that this resulted in the emergence of  numerous middlemen (experts estimate that there are 7 million of  them at this time) who are appropriating a high percentage of  the earnings of agricultural producers--up to 30-40 percent of  the market price. All of this is heightening the local  monopolism of the processing industry and trade and impeding  sales of agricultural products. This has resulted in the  creation of the artificial problem of simulated agricultural  overproduction.    When A. Zaveryukha addressed visitors to the fair, he said  that the government is now planning ways of accumulating  national food resources. To this end, the ministries of  economics and finance will have to arrange for government  regulation of public purchasing power, the guaranteed sale of  agricultural products, and the provision of agricultural  producers with incentives for increased output.    In addition, this year there will be a substantial decrease  in federal demand and the number of federal consumers. Food  purchases by the government will be used only to satisfy the  needs of military personnel and equivalent groups of consumers,  to contribute part of the food supplies of the cities of Moscow  and St. Petersburg and regions of the Far North, to supplement  state reserves, and to create operational government reserves of  a select group of products: grain, potatoes, vegetables, meat,  dairy products, eggs, sugar, vegetable oil, and fish. The  emphasis will be on local production, because less food will be  brought in from CIS countries, and there are virtually no plans  for centralized imports.    In this way, the supply of food for the public and all  consumers will be redirected into market channels. Wholesale  food markets are to be set up on the federal and regional levels  to speed up the transition to more effective forms of trade,  facilitate the offer of agricultural items and food to consumers  by producers, give consumers free access to goods, speed up the  delivery of food products to the retail trade network, establish  realistic market prices, and regulate settlements.    This system should include rayon wholesale markets,  interrayon livestock markets, and large urban wholesale potato,  produce, meat, and fish markets. The system will also include  specialized and general exchanges trading in grain, oil and  oil-bearing seeds, sugar, and several other foods, as well as  forward exchanges and futures.    The Russian wholesale food fair was attended by more than  1,700 representatives of industry and wholesale trade in Russia,  the CIS countries, and the Baltic states and of several foreign  firms, small businessmen, and the agents of various commercial  structures.</p>

			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Technology: Science and the perfect turkey - FT writers offer words of wisdom on food, drink, nutrition and the legend you're likely to be taking part in this weekend Christmas is a time to eat, drink and be merry. For many, it is a time for reflection. For the cook, it is a time for stress. But let us assume that much of the preparation is under way. With only 48 hours to go, it is too late to make the perfect Christmas pudding, but there's still time to get the rest right. As any physicist knows, the important thing is to understand the structure and dimensions of what is being cooked; then know your cooker. Peter Barham, lecturer in physics at the University of Bristol, takes an equation based on Fick's Law of diffusion as a starting point for the right cooking time for a turkey. Fick's Law (named after Adolph Fick, the German physiologist) says that the mass of solute diffusing through unit area per second is proportional to the concentration gradient. Applied to a turkey, Fick would have told his mother to buy a spherical bird, to measure its radius, to use a convection cooker and to hope for the best; expressed as an equation: dm/ds = DS dc/dx. Barham's simplified approach has it that the time for the centre of a turkey to reach a certain temperature is proportional to the square of the radius of the bird. The point is that heat takes longest to reach the centre. The wings and legs may be done to a turn, but the meat inside is only just warming up. Judge a turkey by its inner heat. Yet more important is the bird's molecular structure, which begins to change at specific temperatures. Nicholas Kurti, emeritus professor of physics at Oxford University, points out that the protein molecules in turkey flesh - myosi and actin - cook at meat (not oven) temperatures of between 60`C and 70`C. The blobs of protein start to change shape at lower temperatures as the heat breaks the bonds that normally keep them in place. 'There are two stages,' says Kurti. 'As the meat temperature rises, the molecules unroll and give out threads like an uncurled octopus. The tentacles loosen and spread.' This is the point at which the bird is becoming tender. 'Heat it further and the tentacles start grabbing each other - the molecules coagulate and form a soft but rigid network at about 70`C' This is the critical point. Allow the meat temperature to go much higher, or for coagulation to go on too long, and the networks harden, crack and break up. The bird toughens, and it dries up as the water evaporates. 'You'll get a solid and not very tasty meat,' says Kurti. 'If only the manufacturers would put in with the bird a small, light thermometer, about the size of a darning needle. You stick this into the turkey (where it stays throughout cooking) to check whether the meat on the inside has reached the right temperature.' Moistness also depends on the condition and fat content of the bird (a turkey is roughly 60 per cent water, 20 per cent fat and 20 per cent protein). 'The meat has a loose density, a loose texture which is mainly water,' says Kurti. 'It can dry out whereas if there's more fat, say with a duck, it will be better.' Some cooks dress their turkey in a muslin vest soaked in butter before roasting. The bird, we are told, will emerge a moist and tender creature. But the scientific truth is that the muslin will not help the breast meat deep inside. Its contribution can be only superficial. For cooking times, Kurti says about 20 minutes per pound for a large turkey, but he urges careful observation of temperature and adjustments to time as appropriate. John Fry, lecturer in physics at the University of Liverpool, also recommends watching the bird's temperature. 'The temperature in the middle is a reasonable guide to cooking time. The formula of 20 minutes per pound and 20 more for the bird is very approximate. If it's an enormous piece of meat you would have to cook it longer.' Barham quotes the equation: t = (M/MO) 2/3 tO. This will give the time for cooking your Christmas bird after experimentation, where M = mass, t = time (the only variables), and O denotes constants. In experiments, MO = the mass of a test bird; tO = a fixed cooking time. Time for the bird is worked out once the other figures are inserted after a test run. Harold McGee, author of The Curious Cook and On Food and Cooking - The Science and Lore of the Kitchen, also points to the importance of temperature as it relates to protein coagulation and other changes in the muscle and connective tissues. However, his general approach is about 'doneness' - that is, whether or not the meat looks done, though this is more readily applicable to red meat. On the stuffing, McGee says stuffed poultry should be cooked in an oven temperature of 163`C because 'lower temperatures allow bacteria in the stuffing to flourish for too long, and higher temperatures shorten the cooking time enough that the stuffing may never cook through'. The safety margin on pork is 66`C to kill the trichinae parasite. Kurti cautions against putting the stuffing into the bird cavity. 'It's very tricky if there's raw meat, such as sausage meat. The cavity doesn't get hot enough to cook it.' It should be pre-cooked, cooked separately, or put in the neck, where the temperature is higher. There is no problem with a breadcrumb and chestnut stuffing which takes less time to cook than meat and is not potentially poisonous raw. Now the turkey is safely in the oven, vest on, thermometer in place, the potatoes need attention, particularly those for roasting. Potatoes contain water and starch molecules. 'These puff up,' says Kurti, 'and the potato becomes crumbly and woolly as the starch molecules break up and absorb water.' Overboiling makes them fall apart. Woolly starch molecules are to blame. Kurti's approach to roast potatoes indicates that some of his research has been carried out in the kitchen: 'To produce the right consistency for roasting,' he says, 'it is best to peel them, quarter them and part cook them in the microwave - for five or six minutes. Then put them in the oven in the fat for half to three-quarters of an hour.' Barham's equation for cooking potatoes is t= r 2 /c, where t is cooking time, r the radius of the potato and c the constant which depends on the surface area of the potato and the heat capacity of the water. They should be pre-cooked until they acquire a gel-like surface layer which, says Barham, will prevent the starch granules below absorbing too much fat. Barham thinks the perfect potato should reach 66`C throughout. For the vegetables, overcooking is generally worse than undercooking. But in most cases, cooking enhances flavours because high temperatures 'make the aromatic molecules more volatile and so more easily detected,' says McGee in On Food and Cooking. These volatile compounds, along with nutrients and vitamins, will be driven out with overcooking. Most greens will emerge crisp and more brightly coloured after rapid boiling in large volumes of water for five to seven minutes - uncovered for the first few minutes. The water will dilute the plant's acids, explains McGee, which dull the vegetable colour. Some of the acids will evaporate quickly and will drop back in if the saucepan is covered. If all is well with the vegetables and meat, the gravy will be good too. The worst accidents happen with thickening. Where flour is used, starch molecules swell in the liquid. It becomes crowded and gelatinous with too much flour, McGee warns. Lumps occur because starch gelatinises quickly in hot gravy, creating a barrier to the surrounding liquid. As the turkey is lifted majestically from the oven, only a scientist will reach for the calculator. The rest of us will reach for a cracker, a glass of wine and a party hat. Bon appetit.</p>

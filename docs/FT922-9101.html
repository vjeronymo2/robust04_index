			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan weighed down by further cash calls FURTHER cash calls depressed Milan yesterday while the end of the public sector strike failed to lift Frankfurt. Paris was closed for a holiday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT reacted with uncertainty to the settlement in the public sector pay dispute. Some analysts noted that the agreement was a rebuff to the government's efforts to keep wage rises below 5 per cent and that it would give private sector workers the incentive to seek similar rises. The metal unions are due to ballot members on strike action next week. The DAX index closed down 2.63 at 1,748.18, but was 0.8 per cent higher on the week. The FAZ index was 0.18 lower at 706.62, a gain of 0.8 per cent on the week. Turnover fell to DM5.8bn from DM6.5bn. Volkswagen advanced DM4.80 or 1.2 per cent to DM393.60, following positive results earlier this week which prompted analysts to increase their 1992 profit forecasts. BMW was also firmer, up DM8.50 to DM586 ahead of next Tuesday's annual meeting, while Mercedes rose DM8 to DM605 after forecasting good 1992 prospects at its commercial vehicle division. However, MAN, which expects sales at its truck arm for the year ending June 1992 to be up 14 per cent, lost DM6 to DM375.50. Some analysts said that the prospect of strike action by metal workers hung over the stock. Mannesmann shed DM4.30 to DM280.20 following the release of disappointing 1991 results after Thursday's close. Schering continued to weaken following poor first quarter figures earlier in the week, closing down DM15 or 1.9 per cent at DM786. Hoechst lost 80 pfg to DM254 on news that Petrofina was negotiating to buy its US polyethylene plant. MILAN staggered under the increasing weight of rights issues, following Thursday's late announcement from the insurer Ras and fellow insurer Assitalia's similar news yesterday morning. However, the market got some support from Fiat and Montedison. Dealers were perplexed by the bad timing of the rights issues, given the poor sentiment in the market, as well as the lack of explanation as to why the funds were needed. The Comit index fell 4.08 to 493.33, down 1.9 per cent on the week, in turnover estimated at L115bn after L113.6bn. Ras, which resumed trading after Thursday's suspension dropped L2,030 or 9.7 per cent to L17,910 in heavy volume of 876,300 shares. Dealers said the price was hit by one large seller from London, and that there was no sign that Ras had stepped in to defend its share price. Its savings shares were suspended twice because of the excessive weakness and failed to be officially closed in spite of three attempts. It was quoted as low as L10,750, compared with L13,260 before the announcement. Fiat fell L15 to L5,135 but rebounded to L5,160, supported by Thursday's good industry data. Montedison eased L4 to L1,485 but firmed to L1,490 later in the session. Dealers said there was interest in the shares following some buy notes from brokers and on talk that Montedison might sell all or part of its US operations. ZURICH rose on foreign buying of blue chips. The SMI Index rose 12.3 to 1,949.1, a 3.6 per cent gain on the week. Among banks, UBS registered shares gained SFr15 to SFr805 while its bearers were SFr60 firmer at SFr3,900. Takeover rumours sent Baloise Insurance registered shares up SFr90 to SFr2,350. STOCKHOLM recovered most of its losses caused by news that the government had been forced to bail out Nordbanken. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 1.8 to 1,009.7, up 2.9 per cent on the week, as turnover reached SKr853m from SKr787m. The banking sector dropped 3.4 per cent on the news. SE Banken C shares were down SKr4 or 7.8 per cent to SKr47.50. Nordbanken, which is already 77.3 per cent owned by the government, rose 50 ore to SKr19.50. Ericsson B ended SKr2 higher at SKr134 despite worse-than-expected first quarter results. Volvo B jumped SKr9 to SKr445 on hopes of an early merger with Renault. BRUSSELS ended off the day's highs after hectic trading led by Petrofina, which rose 1.5 per cent. Petrofina ended up BFr175 at BFr11,550, accounting for half the day's volume of BFr1.6bn. The Bel-20 index added 13.09 to 1,211.36, up 1.6 per cent on the week. AMSTERDAM closed slightly firmer. The CBS Tendency index advanced 0.1 to 130.1, for a 1 per cent gain on the week. Turnover was Fl 617m. The publishing sector was strong on a positive report by ABN Amro Bank. VNU put on 70 cents to Fl 90.50, but off an intraday year's high of Fl 91.50, Elsevier advanced 50 cents to Fl 116.90 and Wolters Kluwer closed a net 30 cents higher at Fl 76.60 after going ex-dividend. MADRID's general index rose 3.45 to 254.91 for a 2.48 per cent rise on the week.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - MAY 8 **  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Open    10 am    11 am    12 pm     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm    close 1185.28  1185.26  1186.13  1186.68  1186.82  1188.49  1188.69  1188.95  -----------------------------------------------------------------------             Day's High  1190.24    Day's Low  1184.77  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   May 7     May 6     May 5     May 1     Apr 30 1182.52   1182.62   1178.23   1175.00**  1174.96  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90). ** Partial  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> D. Tax-Exempt Obligations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The proposed regulations provide special rules for tax- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exempt obligations. The IRS and Treasury believe that, given the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited exclusion provided in section 103, it is generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inappropriate to treat payments on a property right embedded in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tax-exempt obligation as interest on an obligation of a State or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> political subdivision (i.e., as tax-exempt interest). Therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> while the noncontingent bond method generally applies to tax- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exempt contingent payment obligations, all positive adjustments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are treated as taxable gain from the sale or exchange of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligation rather than as interest. Negative adjustments are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treated as reducing tax-exempt interest, and, therefore, are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally not taken into account as deductible losses. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative adjustments on a tax-exempt obligation exceed the total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tax-exempt interest a holder receives or accrues on a tax-exempt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligation, the excess is treated as loss from the sale or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exchange of the obligation. This rule is similar to the rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that applies to exchange gains and losses on tax-exempt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligations under &sect;1.988&hyph;3(c)(2). In addition, the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations provide that the projected yield determined for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tax-exempt obligation may not exceed the greater of the yield on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the obligation determined without regard to contingent payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the tax-exempt AFR that applies to the obligation. If the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projected payment schedule results in a higher yield, projected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments must be reduced appropriately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> E. Cross Border Transactions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The IRS and Treasury are concerned about various issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relating to the treatment of foreign holders of contingent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment debt instruments. For example, the IRS and Treasury are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerned about the possibility for tax avoidance that may arise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when a contingent payment debt instrument is structured with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments that approximate the yield on an equity security. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IRS and Treasury invite comments on this issue and other issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning the proper taxation of foreign holders of contingent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment debt instruments issued by U.S. persons or U.S. holders  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of contingent payment debt instruments issued by foreign persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Section 1.1274&hyph;2&blank;Imputed Principal Amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In general, the issue price of a debt instrument subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 1274 is determined by reference to the instrument's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imputed principal amount. The 1992 proposed regulations under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 1274 provided that, in the case of a contingent payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument, the imputed principal amount of the debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument was the present value of the fixed payments plus the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fair market value of the contingent payments. A number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commentators objected to the rule, especially because of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficulty in valuing the contingent payments typically provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for in debt instruments subject to section 1274. Other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commentators objected to the rule's effect on the buyer's basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the property acquired and the seller's amount realized on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sale or exchange. In response to these comments, the final OID  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations reserved on the issue to allow further study and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coordinate the issue with the regulations relating to contingent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment debt instruments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed regulations, the imputed principal amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a contingent payment debt instrument subject to section 1274  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is the sum of the present values of the fixed payments and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present values of the projected amounts of any quotable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contingent payments. Consistent with the treatment of the fixed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments and any quotable contingent payments as a separate debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument under &sect;1.1275&hyph;4 of the proposed regulations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonquotable contingent payments are not taken into account to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine the stated principal amount or the imputed principal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of a contingent payment debt instrument. This rule is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally consistent with the 1986 proposed regulations under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 1274.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations also provide that the imputed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principal amount of a variable rate debt instrument that provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for payments at a single objective rate is determined by assuming  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the payments on the debt instrument are the same as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments on the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under &sect;1.1275&hyph;5(e).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The IRS and Treasury request comments on the effect of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulations on other provisions of the Code, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 108(e)(11), which measures the amount of discharge of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indebtedness income in a debt-for-debt exchange by the issue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price of the newly issued debt instrument.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Conforming Amendments to Section 483.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The proposed regulations provide rules under section 483 for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the treatment of contingent payments under a contract for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sale or exchange of property (&sect;1.483&hyph;4). In general, the rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are the same as the rules for a debt instrument subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 1274, except that a taxpayer takes interest into account  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under its own method of accounting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Section 1.1275&hyph;5&blank;Variable Rate Debt Instruments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In response to comments, the proposed regulations include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes to the final regulations under &sect;1.1275&hyph;5 regarding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment of variable rate debt instruments. The proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations redefine an objective rate as a rate (other than a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualified floating rate) that is determined using a single fixed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formula and that is based on objective financial or economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information. The rate, however, must not be based on information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is within the control of the issuer (or a related party) or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is, in general, unique to the circumstances of the issuer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (or a related party), such as dividends, profits, or the value of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the issuer's stock. The new definition of objective rate is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> broader than the definition in the final regulations and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes, for example, a rate based on changes in a general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inflation index.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations also make it clear that a variable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate debt instrument may not provide for any contingent payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other than certain variable rates of interest. Finally, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulations clarify the treatment of a variable rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument under &sect;1.1275&hyph;5(e)(2). In general, a variable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate debt instrument described in &sect;1.1275&hyph;5(e)(2) is treated like  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a fixed payment debt instrument for purposes of OID and qualified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated interest accruals. The changes to &sect;1.1275&hyph;5(e)(2) clarify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the final OID regulations and, therefore, are proposed to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective for debt instruments issued on or after April 4, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the special rules for tax-exempt contingent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment obligations in the proposed regulations, the IRS and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Treasury request comments on the definition of an objective rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for tax-exempt obligations under &sect;1.1275&hyph;5(c)(5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Yuryev, candidate of physical and mathematical  sciences, Institute of Low-Temperature Engineering Physics at  Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, Kharkov; UDC 681.7.062.536.2]    [Abstract] A method of designing an efficient heat  extraction system for silicon cryomirrors under vacuum used in  infrared astronomy is outlined, the major constraint being that  such mirrors will to operate in a transient temperature field  until the cooling from room temperature to a given low  temperature below is completed with the temperature gradients on  the mirror surface not exceeding permissible magnitudes and the  thermal response of a the mirror to changes in heat and other  loads not exceeding permissible limits. Conventional conductive  cooling is ensured by solid contacts between mirror and heat  extractor. The design procedure is based on a thorough  experimental study on 53 mm long cylindrical mirrors 45 mm in  diameter cut from blanks of cast polycrystalline silicon. Two  radial holes 2 mm apart and as deep as the mirror radius were  drilled one on the reflecting side and one on the dark side, for  insertion of two Cu-constantan thermocouples. The reflecting  surface was totally covered by a solid disk of grade-OOb copper  under a heater coil with power regulation enabling it to act as  an adjustable heat load simulator, large temperature differences  across the interface thus also being attainable for measurement  of its thermal resistance. Its thermal resistance was minimized  by insertion of an indium foil between copper disk and silicon  mirror, and by pressing onto the disk a copper plunger of  special shape 15 mm in diameter at the contact. The plunger was  wrapped in a sleeve of special thermal insulation and to its  free other end was soldered-on a 150 mm long heat extracting  conductor with a 4 mm large effective diameter. From the results  of measurements has been determined the dependence of mirror  temperatures, of temperature differences across critical contact  zones, and of thermal resistances along the heat path on the  length of cooling time. On the basis of these experimental data  supplementing the appropriate mathematical model have been  developed three versions of a Si-cryomirror cooling system: one  with a single heat extracting conductor, one with four such  conductors, and one with a copper hoop around the lateral mirror  surface.

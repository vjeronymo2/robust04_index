			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A bill requiring school administrators to notify teachers whenever a student  with a violent history is assigned to their classroom has been passed  overwhelmingly by the Assembly. The legislation, by Sen. Alan Robbins  (D-Tarzana), would also increase penalties for assaulting a school employee off  school grounds in retaliation for an act performed in the course of the  employee's duties at the school. The bill, which passed on a 68-0 vote, was  prompted by the slaying earlier this year of Hal Arthur, a popular teacher at  Grant High School in Van Nuys. Arthur was ambushed and shot to death with a  semiautomatic weapon as he left his Sherman Oaks home for school on March 24.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Remarks by Anatoliy Chubays, chairman of the State </F> Committee for the Management of State Property, to Mayak  observer Vladimir Pasko; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] The present concept of privatization is based on  vouchers, which the State Committee for the Management of State  Property has issued free of charge to Russian citizens so that  they can acquire property. I can cite the figures, by the way:  Our mid-June results show that over 140 million privatization  vouchers will be collected by the end of the voucher  privatization [30 June]. This is guaranteed. May be we will  even hit 145 million.    Let me remind you that 148 million vouchers have been  issued.  This means, in fact, that an absolute majority of the population  has had an opportunity to invest their vouchers. The state has  provided property for these vouchers -- has come up with the  goods, so to say. This was very important for us because many  previous state programs were based on vouchers before but  failed: Vouchers for harvest-1990, for northerners, for consumer  durables -- the Ryzhkov, Pavlov, and Silayev governments all  gave vouchers a try. All these efforts failed. Our  privatization voucher program is the first to make good the  voucher promises.    The final stage of the privatization -- the June voucher  auctions -- is a unique voucher booster: In June we are  offering twice as much property for sale as for the total of  1994, including the Norilsk Nickel works, a superb enterprise  with a great export potential. [passage omitted]    Now we have the moral right to say: enough, the voucher  privatization, the free privatization now ends. Everybody has  had a chance to invest the vouchers. [passage omitted]    On 30 June we are beginning a new program, in which money  and  finances are the most important. This money will be invested  primarily in enterprises themselves. How is this going to  happen? We will use the tried and tested approaches -- including  auctions. But these are going to be money auctions, not voucher  auctions.    For example, an enterprise will issue a packet of shares  worth 40 percent of its value. This 40 percent packet will be  offered for sale, at a real auction, for money, with a hammer.  There may be three, five, 10, or 15 buyers, and the packet will  go to the highest bidder. Most of the money the bidder has paid  will go to the enterprise, so it can buy new equipment, cut  costs, or do market research. The remaining shares may also be  sold.    Some sales may be conditional, for instance on ecological  grounds: You can buy this enterprise, but you must know that  within five years you must reduce the waste the enterprise  throws into the air or into the water. These procedures are  possible, they are envisaged by our document. [passage omitted]    Some people say that this is privatization for the rich, and  that the grass roots will not benefit. This is a false  impression. Look at what is happening. The rich, those who are  able to spend a lot of money at tenders, invest in an  enterprise, which already has shareholders from the first stage  of the transfer to joint stock -- members of the work collective  who received the 51 percent of shares in-house for example, or  those who received shares of the enterprise at voucher auctions.  So in fact, those who became shareholders at the first stage of  the privatization free of charge are gaining access to financial  resources at the second stage. The shareholders win, the  enterprise wins, and hence the economy wins. So let me say  again that the whole thrust of the new privatization beginning 1  July is in building up enterprises themselves. [passage omitted]    The final objective of the first stage of the privatization  was expressed in quantitative terms to create a wide class of  shareholders. Even our most fierce opponents agree that there  are 40 million shareholders in Russia. Let me remind you that  Russia's adult population is 70 million, so in fact there are 70  million owners. They often do not understand what it means and  what rights they have, what they can or cannot do, or what  dividends they will receive. However, they are owners, and you  cannot take away from them the share or shares they own. For us  it means that the main objective has been reached: a class of  property owners has been created. [passage omitted]    The objective of the second stage is that privatized  enterprises must be encouraged to develop quality, not quantity.  They should be encouraged to undergo reconstruction -- this is  becoming a key word for us now -- and to fit into the new market  using the finances they will have access to at the second state  of the privatization. [passage omitted]    I believe the second stage will last two to three years. It  will finish of its own accord, when all packets of shares are  sold. But as it draws to a close, it will create the secondary  market, an important factor of a market economy. The owner of  the packet may sell it at some stage, so capital will start  moving -- from less productive to more productive enterprises.  This is what economists call the capital market, without which  the goods market will not exist. [passage omitted] Russian  privatization will reach this objective.</p>

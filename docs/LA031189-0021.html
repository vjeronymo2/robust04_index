			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SUSPENDED OFFICER FACES HEARING ON 17 MISCONDUCT COUNTS  </P> <P> A 12-year veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department has been accused of 17  counts of administrative misconduct, including perjury, submitting phony  overtime requests, ignoring court subpoenas and mistreating citizens,  authorities said Friday.  </P> <P> Sergio Garcia, 33, who was assigned to the Van Nuys Division, was relieved of  duty without pay Jan. 27 and is scheduled to appear April 19 before a police  board, which could recommend that he be fired, said Cmdr. William Booth.  </P> <P> "For a police officer, these are very serious," Booth said. "There is quite an  accumulation of charges . . . and if he is found guilty, severe punishment --  along the lines of firing or suspension -- is a real possibility."  </P> <P> Garcia, who lives in Canyon Country, is on trial in Newhall Municipal Court on  a charge of falsely reporting a misdemeanor. That charge, which is not included  in the police case, stems from an altercation between Garcia and Jeanette Cox,  also of Canyon Country.  </P> <P> Cox alleges that Garcia threatened to kill her for blocking his way into a  parking place at a grocery store. Garcia, however, filed a police report  claiming that Cox dented his car. The case is scheduled to continue Monday.  </P> <P> The police administrative charges against Garcia resulted from an investigation  initiated after other police officers complained about his conduct, Booth said.  They include giving false testimony while on duty and under oath in Los Angeles  Municipal Court, failing to release a prisoner in a timely manner after  determining that he was not involved in criminal activity and twice failing to  appear in court when subpoenaed.  </P> <P> The suspension notice also states that Garcia improperly seized property  belonging to four video stores in Los Angeles and Ontario while working at an  off-duty job.  </P> <P> Other charges against Garcia, who could not be reached for comment Friday,  include using a stolen registration tag on his car instead of registering it  with the Department of Motor Vehicles and failing to notify the DMV when he was  involved in a traffic accident last month.  </P> <P> At the April 19 board hearing, three police officers above the rank of captain  are scheduled to hear evidence against Garcia. If the tribunal determines that  he is guilty, it will recommend punishment to Chief Daryl F. Gates, who can  either follow the recommendation or lessen the sentence.  </P></p>

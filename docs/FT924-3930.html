			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / International Company News: SEC bans Gutfreund for life over bond auctions THE US Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday announced that Mr John Gutfreund, the former chairman of Wall Street securities house Salomon, and three other former senior Salomon executives, have agreed to settle charges that they failed to properly supervise the firm's government bond trading desk between 1989 and 1991, when it was involved in illegal bidding during Treasury auctions. The settlements follow Tuesday's announcement that the SEC is suing Mr Paul Mozer, the former head of government bond trading at Salomon, for his alleged part in the scandal that rocked Salomon in August 1991. Mr Mozer, and a senior aide who worked with him on the bond desk at the time, have been charged with violating federal securities law by submitting false orders for securities to circumvent government bidding limits. Both men are contesting the charges. Under yesterday's settlement, Mr Gutfreund was fined Dollars 100,000 and is barred from taking charge of a securities firm for life. Mr Thomas Strauss, the ex-president of Salomon, was fined Dollars 75,000 and is suspended from the securities industry for six months, while Mr John Meriwether, a former vice-chairman, was fined Dollars 50,000 and barred from the business for three months. All three accepted their settlements without admitting or denying wrongdoing. The three executives resigned in August last year, soon after it was discovered that they had waited several months before informing the authorities about false bids submitted by Salomon's trading desk in a number of Treasury auctions. It was their failure to report the illegal bids immediately, and their failure to discipline Mr Mozer for his actions, that led the SEC to charge the executives with failure to supervise. The SEC said that there was no evidence that Mr Gutfreund, Mr Strauss or Mr Meriwether were involved in the illegal bidding. Of the various sanctions, Mr Gutfreund's is the most severe. While the Dollars 100,000 fine is not particularly substantial, the SEC's decision to bar him from running a securities firm is a significant blow to a man who made his name and fortune as the head of the biggest bond trading house in the US. Mr Donald Feuerstein, a fourth ex-Salomon executive, the former chief legal officer who also resigned over the bond trading scandal, was not fined or suspended, but was criticised in the SEC report on the matter for his role in not reporting the firm's illegal activities earlier.</p>

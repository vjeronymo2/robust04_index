			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SATURDAY'S FOE IS MICHIGAN;  </P> <P> BRUINS CAUTIOUS ABOUT FACING WINLESS TEAM  </P> <P> UCLA will face a winless team Saturday night. But Bruins Coach Terry Donahue  believes it is a team that just as easily could be considered the best in the  nation.  </P> <P> Michigan certainly would be ranked No. 1 had it beaten Notre Dame last Saturday  instead of losing a 24-19 decision to the Fighting Irish.  </P> <P> "If you take two plays off the film, Michigan is the No. 1 team in the  country," Donahue said, referring to Raghib (Rocket) Ismail's two kickoff  returns for touchdowns. "But you can't take those two plays off, and that's to  Notre Dame's credit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'No Question'  </P> <P> "In my mind, there's no question Michigan is going to win the football game  (without the two plays)."  </P> <P> Michigan was ranked second before losing to Notre Dame in its season opener.  The Wolverines, now ranked fifth, will probably come to California in an angry  frame of mind.  </P> <P> Asked if it would have been easier for the Bruins to prepare for Michigan had  the Wolverines beaten Notre Dame, Donahue smiled and said, "Our task, getting  ready for Michigan, was going to be hard no matter how you cut the bread."  </P> <P> UCLA, ranked 24th, brings a 1-1 record into the nationally televised contest,  which begins at 5 p.m. at the Rose Bowl.  </P> <P> Donahue realizes the Bruins have not been very impressive so far this year.  </P> <P> After being hammered 24-6 by 14th-ranked Tennessee in their opener Sept. 9, the  Bruins rallied for a 28-25 victory over 20-point underdog San Diego State last  Saturday night.  </P> <P> He views Saturday's game as a test of character for his team.  </P> <P> "You'd have to be blind to not see what kind of a football team they have.  Michigan is one of the top football teams in the country. I really view the  Michigan game as an opportunity for our football team to step forward and show  its colors. . . .  </P> <P> "The biggest concern I have about our football team right now is we must  increase our intensity all over the field. We were more intense (against San  Diego State) than we were against Tennessee. We stayed in the game and really  competed for four quarters. I guarantee you we'll take a step forward this  week."  </P> <P> The Wolverines will be without quarterback Michael Taylor, who was injured in  the Notre Dame game. Coach Bo Schembechler will have to start freshman Elvis  Grbac at quarterback.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Both Good Athletes'  </P> <P> Donahue said the switch probably will not affect the Bruins.  </P> <P> "They're both good athletes," Donahue said. "Grbac did an excellent job against  Notre Dame. He doesn't run as well as Taylor but showed a lot of poise."  </P> <P> "What it does, it cuts us down," Schembechler said. "We're going to cut back on  what we're doing offensively. I don't want to put that kind of pressure on  Elvis to be a Michael Taylor and know as much of our offense as Taylor does."  </P></p>

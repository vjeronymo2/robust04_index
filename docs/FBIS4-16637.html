			<p>BFN     [Text] Head of the Ukrainian president's domestic policy  service Nikolay Mikhalchenko expressed hope that the Ukrainian  parliament would after all put off presidential elections from  26 June to a later date. "The most important thing now is to  save the state," he told journalists during RUKH's Fifth  Congress.    "If we `kill' the last authority, we'll allow both internal  and external forces to do anything they want," he said.    He also said that the elections of local governments on 26  June, in accordance with the current law, would disintegrate the  country and lead to a federalization in its worst form.  According to the law on local governments, the heads of the  local councils will possess executive authority in all its  entirety, and the institution of the president's representatives  will be annulled. "This law was favored by the local  bureaucrats who want to rule in the periphery," said  Mikhalchenko.    Earlier, RUKH leader Vyacheslav Chernovyl had supported the  president's proposal on putting off presidential elections to a  later date.    Commenting on the agreements on economic integration within  the CIS, signed in Moscow on 15 April, Mikhalchenko said that  "in the absence of exact wordings, everyone is interpreting  these agreements the way he likes." In his opinion, this is due  to the fact that the CIS remains an association of unequal  members.</p>

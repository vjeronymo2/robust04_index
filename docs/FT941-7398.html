			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Kiev MPs slap down Crimea Ukraine's parliament sought to put Crimea in its place yesterday, affirming that the region had no right to conduct independent foreign, defence or monetary policies. It voted by 222 votes to four to give authorities in the peninsula a month to bring Crimea's constitution and legislation into line with Ukrainian law. The move was directed at efforts by Crimea's new president, Mr Yuri Meshkov, to forge closer ties with Russia. Ukraine's defence minister, Mr Vitaly Radetsky, denied reports that seven air force generals had resigned in protest at the appointment of a new air force commander.</p>

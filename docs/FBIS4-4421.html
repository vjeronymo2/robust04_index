			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "What Japan Should Learn From Recovery of U.S. </F> Economy"]    [Text] Japanese industrialists, who had said until recently  that they had nothing to learn from the U.S. economy, are now  voicing the need to learn once again from the U.S. economy.  They have lost their self-confidence, and its loss has come too  abruptly. It is important, however, for them to humbly verify  how the U.S. economy has recovered and to learn from the  recovery to revitalize Japan's economy.    The U.S. economy has shown a remarkable recovery by  registering a high, 7.5-percent growth rate during the  October-December quarter. During the same quarter, the Japanese  economy posted negative growth of 2.2 percent, thus  demonstrating a large gap in the growth rates between the  Japanese and U.S. economies. The Federal Reserve Board (FRB),  which had stuck to a monetary policy of keeping real interest  rates low, has returned to a tight monetary policy by twice  raising the interest rates for federal funds (FF).    The Clinton administration's macroeconomic policy basically  aims to spur the U.S. economy by keeping interest rates low  through cuts in the federal budget deficit. Plants' rate of  production soared to 83 percent of capacity, and this has caused  concerns that the U.S. economy could become overheated and be a  bubble economy. It is a matter of course for the FRB to shift  to a tight monetary policy. The Clinton administration, which  sought a low-interest-rate policy, has no choice but to accept  the FRB's shift.    Looking at the world economy, the so-called  "English-speaking  economic group" of the United States, Britain, Canada, and  Australia was in the grip of a serious recession shortly after  the end of the cold war. FRB Chairman Greenspan once revealed a  sense of crisis, saying, "The U.S. economy is about to face  unprecedented difficulties." Meanwhile, the economies of a  united Germany, the European nations, and Japan remained notably  robust.  <H5>  Structural Shift Through Revitalization of Market Function </H5>   The English-speaking economic group is now enjoying a  booming  economy after coming out of a recession, thus throwing cold  water on Japan and Germany, which are still mired in recession.  This phenomenon of a reversal cannot be explained simply by a  time lag in the economic cycle.    The recovery of the English-speaking economic group,  especially the United States, has occurred after it made its  economic system, which emphasizes the market, function smoothly,  and it has accomplished a shift in its economic structures  during a recession in a relatively short period.    Major U.S. industries, including the automobile industry,  have studied the management strategy of Japanese enterprises  from various angles. They have thoroughly restructured  themselves to improve productivity and to bolster  competitiveness with the aim of outstripping Japanese  enterprises. General Electric Chairman Jack Welch once said, "I  intend to `imbue the spirit of a small corporation' in order to  revitalize our bloated organization." In this way, U.S.  corporations have streamlined their management.    Major U.S. banks, like their Japanese counterparts, were  saddled with bad loans because of the financial and real-estate  recession, but their performance is now improving after writing  off these bad loans. Bank loans have become more available than  ever, thus smoothing the flow of money. The market has given  high marks to U.S. corporations' cuts in dividends and their  paying off of debts as part of their efforts to streamline  management, and this has made it possible for them to speedily  write off their bad loans. Citicorp Chairman John Reed and other  many other U.S. bank executives have been highly praised for  fulfilling their management responsibilities rather than being  blamed for writing off their bad loans to streamline their  banks' management.    U.S. corporations and banks have been able to thoroughly  restructure themselves because deregulation has kept open the  opportunities for new businesses. In the information and  telecommunications sector, which is said to have the potential  of generating explosive demand, deregulation has removed the  fence between telephone firms and cable television firms. Vice  President Gore has announced plans to build an information  superhighway. New plans, which can be assessed as being a  little overoptimistic, have been announced.    Unlike the Republican administration, which despised  industrial policy as a "filthy term," the Clinton  administration, which has handled the economy as a priority  policy task, has begun implementing its industrial policy  centering on basic industrial technology. The administration  recently announced a new program of private-public sector  cooperation to develop the next-generation semiconductor.    A shift in the structure of the U.S. economy has begun  taking effect in concert with restructuring efforts by  corporations and banks and with the Clinton administration's  strategy. The change in the economic structure has resulted in  high unemployment. The jobless rate has soared to 6.5 percent,  and the United States has yet to escape its jobless growth.  Labor Secretary Reich once attacked corporations for sharply  cutting their work forces, saying, "U.S. corporations have cut  too deeply into their hearts."    U.S. manufacturing industry, which is eager to improve its  productivity, is trying to reduce its work force as much as  possible. The absorption of workers by the service sector still  remains weak. Even if jobless persons who used to serve in the  military or work in high-tech industries find service-sector  jobs, they complain about low wages and consider service-sector  work to be not worthwhile. They are highly depressed mentally.  <H5>  Japan Urged To Create New Businesses Through Deregulation </H5>   What should Japan learn from the recovery of the U.S.  economy? The blind introduction of the U.S. method of cutting  the work force would cost society too dearly. Japan has no  choice but to grope for its own coordinated method of  employment. Strengthening the market function through  deregulation and creating new demand would be the way to rid  Japan of its recession. It can be said that excessive  regulations are keeping both Japan and Germany from escaping  their recessions.    Deregulation is a policy goal of the Hosokawa government,  which is seeking economic reform. In fact, however, deregulation  has made little headway because the government has only named  the sectors to be deregulated. Deregulation will be  incorporated in a package of measures that the government will  formulate in late March to open the Japanese market. If each  ministry and agency makes a piecemeal deregulation proposal in  order to share the pain, deregulation thus would be meaningless.    It would be more effective for the government to set policy  goals for sectors, as was done for the  information-telecommunications sector in the United States, and  to announce steps to relax the current regulations governing  such sectors. It is important for the government to consider  relaxing the regulations with specific purposes in mind instead  of stressing aimless deregulation.    Industrial policy should be reviewed sweepingly. It is  necessary for this policy to stop taking measures for  enterprises which could lead to managed trade, and it is  necessary that it emphasizes assistance to the research and  development of basic industrial technology. In the present  world economy, developing countries in Latin America and Asia  are now equal with the industrialized nations in the  manufacturing area. To raise the level of technology, which is  the foundation of Japan's economy, both the government and  private sector need to rebuild the current research and  development system.    In the post-cold war world economy, there is no dominant  economic superpower as the United States was in the past. Just  as U.S. corporations have learned from Japanese enterprises'  management, Japanese enterprises should embrace the merits of  U.S. corporations' management and cost consciousness. Both  Japanese and U.S. enterprises have entered an age in which they  learn from each other and give an impetus to each other.</p>

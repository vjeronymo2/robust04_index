			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article in three installments: "A Patchwork </F> Regime--the Deepening Fluidity in the Political World"]  <H5>  [23 Apr 94 p 36] </H5>   [Text] A week has passed since Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa suddenly expressed his desire to resign. The "deepening  fluidity" in the political world touched off over whom to select  as his successor has subsided for the time being through the  birth of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. However, the signs of  dissolution of both the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the  Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] facing the danger of  split have not disappeared. Our present regime is like a  patchwork in which pieces of cloth are coercively stitched  together. Thread frays show horribly, and tears and rips are  likely to appear here and there before long. The following is a  report on the present political world pivoting around the new  regime.    Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa again did not  appear. The time was 1500 on 22 April. The place was a large  lecture hall on the fifth floor of the No. 1 Annex to the lower  house. A press conference was held there to announce the  decision to support Mr. Hata. Seated on a chair reserved for Mr.  Ozawa was Secretary Moriyoshi Sato. He was there in place of Mr.  Ozawa. He said: "I was in a sauna bath when there was a sudden  call asking me to `be here because Mr. Ozawa needs a member to  accompany him.' Why is it I who should be here?"    A very similar scene was also seen at a press conference  held  in June 1993 at Akasaka Prince Hotel to announce the start of  Shinseito. Mr. Ozawa hammers out policies while Mr. Hata, who is  good at putting up a front, is used for performances. This  Shinseito strategy is seen transparently through these events.    "Among Japanese politicians, on whom should we rely?" asked  James Foster, councilor in charge of economic affairs in the  U.S. Embassy, when he was visiting the office of former Deputy  Prime Minister and Justice Minister Masaharu Gotoda in the  Members' Office Building of the lower house at 1600 on 3 April  after the Japanese-U.S. summit talks were broken off. Former  Justicie Minister Gotoda answered immediately that "it would be  Ozawa." Mr. Foster responded with a nod, saying that "that is  also what I have thought."    It is becoming a matter of common knowledge that the United  States intends to make Mr. Ozawa the contact for  behind-the-scenes negotiations.    Over the automobile issue which is said to symbolize  Japan-U.S. economic friction, it is said that Mr. Ozawa is  continuing negotiations below the surface of the water, using  transport bureaucrats. According to a person concerned, talks  are frequently held between U.S. Ambassador to Japan Mondale and  Mr. Ozawa.    There is a person who foresaw close Hata-Ozawa relations a  fairly long time ago.    On the afternoon of 20 March 1992, about 30 people concerned  with the political world crowded into a sickroom of Showa  University Hospital. The sickroom was filled to overflowing, and  the visitors even crowded the hallway. At bedside was Mr. Hata  who kept placing his hand on the left breast of a man lying in  his sickbed. At 1555, Mr. Hata confirmed the cessation of the  man's heartbeat.    The man was Mr. Takashi Yamasaki (then 61). He served two  generations of the Hata family--Mr. Hata and his father, the  late Bushiro Hata--for over 30 years. A person close to Mr.  Yamasaki says: "Yamasaki handled every minor detail in the Hata  office. I think that, but for him, there would never be today's  Hata." He worked as chairman of the Society of Secretaries  belonging to the Tanaka faction's Mokuyo Club and the Takeshita  faction's Keiseikai. He was a secretary of great caliber who is  said to have often managed elections for entire factions.    During his lifetime, Mr. Yamasaki used to tell his friends  that "it is my dream to make Hata a prime minister." However,  when questioned, "Do you really think he will be able to become  prime minister?" he is said to have replied: "I might be  expecting too much. He might be a lower house speaker type." As  to Mr. Ozawa, he used to say that "he is a man with terrible  guts."    However, there is also a possibility that the relationship  of  the two may suffer a subtle change through Hata's assumption of  the office of prime minister.    At a session of the upper house Budget Committee on 10  December 1992, the face of Mr. Hata, who kept answering  questions with a gentle look, suddenly flushed.    This happened when Mr. Yoshinori Yoshioka (Japan Communist  Party [JCP]) queried him about Mr. Ozawa, saying that Ozawa had  a hand in secret talks of the GATT's new multilateral trade  negotiations (the Uruguay Round) on opening the rice market. Mr.  Hata stressed the difference of views between the two, saying "I  wonder why Mr. Ozawa met with someone like that and how he could  have useful talks."    Hata himself once said that "Ozawa is a scriptwriter and I  am  an actor." However, he recently confided to his close friend:  "In fact, we do not meet each other very often. We are both  busy."    Dogged always by the shadow of Mr. Ozawa, the Hosokawa  cabinet was criticized as a "regime with a deepening dual  structure." What path will the Hata cabinet choose?  <H5>  [24 Apr 94 p 23] </H5>   [Text] "All were well-worn bills tied up in a bundle with  rubber bands. We received them twice--10 million yen each time."  This is what a secretary to a freshman Diet member who received  monetary assistance from the party in the July 1993 general  election confided to people close to him. Needless to say, the  head of Shinseito is Tsutomu Hata.    At a session of the lower house Ad Hoc Committee on  Political  Reform held on 5 November 1993, Hidekatsu Yoshii (JCP), a  committee member, asked: "You are surely saying that no other  than officially approved expenses (5 million yen) were handed,  are you not?"    "Yes, I am," answered [then] Deputy Prime Minister and  Foreign Minister Hata.    Shinseito had announced that it pegged on its own the  officially approved expenses at 5 million yen. Testimony by  candidates' secretaries indicated that, other than this amount,  there were also 15 million yen of election funds. The party had  69 candidates. Yoshii, the committee member, queried further,  asking: "The total comes up to more than 1 billion yen (at an  offhand estimate). What is the source of the funds?" Mr. Hata  wholly denied his allegations.    Now that he has become the prime minister, he will  undoubtedly be asked to explain one more time on this issue.    "Hata B"...    In March 1993, MAINICHI SHIMBUN obtained a list of  politicians receiving contributions from Shimizu Corp., a major  general construction firm (general contractor), and Hata's name  was on the list. Recipients of 10 million yen belonging to the  highest SA [special A] rank were only former LDP Vice President  Shin Kanemaru and former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita. Among  those listed in the A rank deserving of 5 million yen were  former Prime Ministers Kiichi Miyazawa and Yasuhiro Nakasone  and, along with them, Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa.    Those belonging to the B rank like Hata were listed as 3  million yen recipients. A Hata aide said that "the issue would  be investigated" when the list was made public, but no reply has  yet been made.  <H5>  General Contractors' Contributions to Hata and Ozawa </H5> Shrouded in Mystery    Monetary scandals related to Mr. Hata have not surfaced  despite his past affiliations with the LDP's Tanaka faction and  Keiseikai, which could not rid themselves of the collusion  between money and politics. However, we see a sign that the  LDP's zoku Dietmen system, which has been called the hotbed of  the party's collusion with business circles, is even reviving  within Shinseito which has grabbed power [zoku--a group of Diet  members who exercise in a particular field policymaking  expertise and contacts generally acquired through service as  chairman or vice chairman of the appropriate party policy  deliberation committee].    Early this year when the Special Investigation Department of  the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office was conducting its  final probe into the involvement of the political world as part  of the so-called general contractor graft scandal, the  department summoned former leaders and executives of Hazama  Corp. (main office at Minato ward, Tokyo) to hear their  testimonies in strict secrecy.    They were summoned because among data confiscated by the  Special Investigation Department from the Hazama main office  were records indicating that an amount of 10 million yen was  disbursed to Mr. Ozawa's camp in the middle of December 1991.  Ozawa's camp totally denies receiving the contribution. In  addition, it was also discovered that Ozawa had received a  donation of 5 million yen from Kajima Corp. At a press  conference on 8 November 1993, answering a question if the  donation did not conflict with the Regulation of Money for  Political Activities Act, he simply said that "the donation was  handled legitimately" and did not mention a bit about the way  the donation was dealt with, saying that "it is not legally  asked" to specify handling methods.    Shinseito lower house member Toshihiro Nikai is said to be  Ozawa's confidant. In the "National Association of Tourist  Organizations" (Minato ward, Tokyo) made up of 5,200  medium-sized and small tourist companies, you will see calendars  carrying a big picture of Mr. Nikai hung up in every quarter.    When Mr. Nikai became parliamentary vice minister for  transport in August 1993, he resigned as chairman of the  association. However, he recently became the association's  "honorary chairman" on 18 April. The reason for his earlier  resignation was that "it is against the cabinet rules on  concurrent positions for him--the Transport Ministry's  second-highest leader--to additionally become the head of an  organization which is under the ministry's supervision" (the  Transport Ministry's Tourism Department). However, putting a  generous construction on the rules, a decision was later made  that "it is all right if the [additional] post is served without  pay and without the right of decision" (the same source).    Mr. Nikai inaugurated the "100-Person Committee Considering  Japan's Tourism" in February. He enrolled into the membership  the top-class organizations under the Transport Ministry's  supervision such as the JR [Japan Railways] companies, major  travel agencies, and the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation.  He placed the committee's Secretariat in the National  Association of Tourist Organizations. The April issue of the  association organ, in its last page, carries a colored ad by an  airline company. An association worker admits that "airline  companies can hardly refuse to place an ad because the  parliamentary vice minister for transport is the honorary  chairman of this organization." The rules on concurrent  positions remain ambiguous.    On 24 June 1993, the day after Shinseito was inaugurated,  Mr.  Hata attended a party held by the party's Diet members in the  New Otani Hotel. Faced with a barrage of questions from  reporters as to such an old money-collecting method used since  the LDP, he said in a harsh tone that "you are always talking  about such things, and that is why you are dead wrong."    An LDP member is heard asking to himself in a whisper: "We  were criticized about the relations between politics and money,  and what makes them different from us?"  <H5>  [25 Apr 94 p 23] </H5>   [Text] "I did not expect him to go so far as to call it a  `war of aggression.'" On 10 August 1993, year, speaking at his  first press conference since his inauguration, Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa clearly stated that the Pacific War was a "war  of aggression," thereby becoming the first prime minister to do  so. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata  disclosed: "I proposed to Mr. Hosokawa that he show clearly that  Japan has searched its soul deeply over its past and that it  intends to tell right from wrong in a clear-cut manner in this  regard for a fresh start. But I did not expect him to say that  much..."    On the anniversary of the end of the war five days later,  Mr.  Hata did not make an appearance at the Yasukuni Shrine in Kudan,  Tokyo. However, he already had paid a visit to the shrine on the  previous day, shunning the public eye. When Hata attended a  national memorial ceremony for the war dead, he was unexpectedly  asked by reporters about his visit to the shrine. Taken by  surprise, he asked back in a harsh tone: "How did you know  that?" When asked, "Did you make the visit as a private  individual or a public figure?" he declined to answer, saying  that "this matter becomes an issue in foreign countries because  you ask such questions."    Hata cannot become as reformist as Hosokawa on how to view  the Pacific War. He is the type who is "everybody's friend."  With this nature, how is he going to cope with the peace and  defense issue on which the people are widely divided? Shinseito  which heads the ruling coalition has inaugurated the Society for  Visiting Yasukuni Shrine. Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries  Minister Eijiro Hata and others attended the shrine's Spring  Festival on the morning of 21 April. Shinseito is thus showing  its unpainted face as a "conservative party." Until his  secession from the LDP, Tsutomu Hata also worked as chairman of  the "Society of Diet Members Who Visit Yasukuni Shrine Together"  (membership: 210 lower house and upper house members).    A commencement ceremony was held in the National Defense  Academy (Yokosuka City, Kanagawa Prefecture) on 20 March. Chief  Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura and Defense Agency Director  General Kazuo Aichi of Shinseito delivered an address.    In contrast to Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura's stress on  the "construction of a substantial nation," Director General  Aichi emphasized the Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro  Ogawa-style theory of the state, saying that "we are asked to  fulfill the responsibility and role commensurate with our  international status."    A leading Defense Agency official makes the following remark  in this connection: "Two days before the commencement ceremony,  Mr. Aichi took a look at the draft of the address Chief Cabinet  Secretary Takemura was scheduled to make, and then he himself  composed his speech as director general on the manuscript paper  we provided for him."    "We will be unable to take any step unless we prepare  amendments to some domestic laws in the form of emergency  defense legislation." This is what Mr. Ozawa said at a series of  meetings attended by delegates of ruling coalition parties.  Though deleted later, the term "collective measures" which  reminds us of the "right of collective self-defense" was also  incorporated into a draft agreement at one time. Some  expressions [in the agreement] were corrected in the face of  resistance by the SDPJ, which asked, "Do you all mean to say  that you do not need both the Constitution and the SDPJ?"  Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said: "We carried our point after  all, and there is no room for interpreting any items agreed on  as conducive to emergency defense legislation." However, other  ruling coalition leaders show a cold response, saying that  "there is no change in substance."    The prime minister cannot escape the criticism that he is  performing only for show; nevertheless, he made the  "announcement on the war of aggression" and delivered his speech  in ordinary, casual suits at a Self-Defense Forces military  parade, thereby bringing the people to keenly feel a stream of  change from the LDP position on the security and defense issue.  However, Shinseito led by Mr. Ozawa appears to be pursuing a  "major country" policy line more than the LDP regime.    How will Mr. Hata steer the ship of state? His longtime  friend Takashi Kosugi, an LDP lower house member, discloses:  "His theory of the state is not clear in outline. He lends his  ear to various opinions in a flexible manner, but he does not  make self-assertions. It might be said that he goes with the  general trend of the times. After all, he might follow the way  Ozawa thinks. In this respect, I feel slightly uneasy."    Frays of patches show horribly in the coalition government  as  in a patchwork finished poorly, and such a coalition government  is to make a start on 25 April.</p>

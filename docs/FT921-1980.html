			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Wm Bedford cuts loss to Pounds 210,000 William Bedford, the USM-quoted antique dealer, cut its pre-tax loss from Pounds 259,000 to Pounds 210,000 for the 1991 year after an exceptional gain on the sale of an asset. However the Winchester-based company said that the underlying trend showed no sign of recovery and a further loss was expected in the present six months. The first two months had shown an improvement but that was compared with the market depressed by the Gulf war. Turnover for the year fell to Pounds 1.63m (Pounds 2.03m). The loss was higher than it would have been because of the need to make further provisions against the realisable value of slow moving stock. Losses per share came out at 2.6p (4p).</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Xiang Xiaofang (0686 1420 2397): "A Longer Rope </F> Is Needed To Control the Wide Horse of Inflation"]    [Text] Sufferings of a Benchworker in a Wave of  "Price Increases"    The 200 million urban residents in China have begun to  receive the tremendous pressure since the beginning of 1994.  Right after absorbing the two-digit inflation in 1993, they have  witnessed the tide of rural workers who have flooded the cities.  When the raging tide of rural workers slightly subsided, they  are once again awakened by the loud clamors of "price increases."    Under the influence of increasing demand and high production  costs, the market price had sharply increased in January. The  prices for consumer goods in January rose 23.1 percent as  compared with that of the same period in 1993. The rate of  increases for food, clothing, health care, entertainment,  education and culture was even relatively higher.    Due to the after-effect of the excessive amount of currency  in circulation, the price of basic industrial products continued  to rise on a large scale in February, and signs showing price  increases were everywhere on the market. The rate of price  increases for the first two months in 1994 still exceeded 20  percent over the corresponding period in 1993.    Since the People's Bank of China had once again handled  value-guaranteed saving deposits on 11 July 1993, it had, for  the first time, announced that the annual subsidy rate for  value-guaranteed saving deposits was set to 1.19 percent in  March 1994. The All China Federation of Trade Unions also made  public that about 7 million workers are badly off in the whole  country.    On the eve of the "two sessions," Fang Shunping, a  benchworker in Yongsheng Machinery Plant in Fuzhou, Jiangxi  narrated a pathetic story to a grassroots-level trade union  cadre about how he suffered from the skyrocketing commodity  price.    He said: "Our plant suffered financial losses since last  year. I and my wife persistently worked hard everyday. Our  combined wages total slightly over 300 yuan.    "Our chubby boy is a fourth-grade student. He does not care  much about food or clothes. The only thing he likes most is to  play the game machine. However, I cannot afford to buy a game  machine.    "In order to play the game machine, my son let those  students with game machines to ride him as a horse everyday.  Once I discovered that. I pulled my perspiring son to the side,  and asked him why he did something stupid like this? He said  nothing, but struggled to get free and ran away. Only when he  came home, did he tell me the reason in tears.    "In the evening, my son who finished his homework told me  quietly: `Dad, buy me a game machine please. If I have a game  machine, I will not let other students ride me as a horse.'    "I felt really bad. Hugging him tightly, I said: `It is not  that I am unwilling to buy you a game machine. It is just  because that commodity price is so high that I cannot afford to  buy the game machine. I can barely buy food with what I earn. I  really cannot help you.'    "My son seemed to understand my plight. With grievous  disappointment, he went to bed. That night, I could not sleep.  The price is going up and up like a balloon filled with hydrogen  gas. Why is that?"    The question posed by Fang Shunping is also in the minds of  the 7 million workers who are badly off. Whoever listens to his  grievances is not only the basic-level trade union cadre. These  workers often hear that they must pay a price for carrying out  reform. They only want to know how high the price they need to  pay this year. They also understand that they need to withstand  hardship in order to successfully carry out reform. They only  want to know for what they need to suffer so much.  <H5>  Probe Sources of High Price Index </H5>   The civilian sector and the government have their own  forecasts for this year's general level of retail sales. Not  long ago, the "Department of Macro-Economic Analysis of China"  conducted the 6th survey on China's economic situation by  distributing questionnaires to the specialists concerned. One  hundred fifty-eight economists expressed their own views on  this. According to statistics, 32.9 of them predicted that the  rate of increase of retail sales will be in the range of 12-14  percent; 29.1 percent of them predicted 8-10 percent; and 22.8  percent of them predicted 12-14 percent. Some young scholars  conducted simulated tests on the economic situation in 1992 and  1993. Their conclusion was that if the rate of economic growth  in 1994 is maintained at approximately 10 percent, then the rate  of increase of retail price index will be in the range of 12-13  percent. Their judgment has been proven correct by the red light  shown by the price indices of the three months in this year's  first quarter. Therefore, high commodity price will remain the  major rhythm in 1994. There are five reasons for this.    1. After-Effects of Price Reform. Since the price reform,  more than 80 percent of the price for means of production and 90  percent of the price for means of subsistence have been  completely decontrolled. The seriously distorted price structure  has been gradually corrected by the large price increases for  the basic industrial products. For example, after its decontrol,  the price of grain and fuel rose by 35.5 percent and 78 percent,  respectively. These large price increases for basic capital  goods and consumer goods have pushed up the production costs of  farm products and industrial manufactured goods, and made the  prices for products manufactured by related industries to go up.  As seen from the situation in 1994, the series of price  adjustments recently announced will become a major reason for  pushing up China's general price index for this year.    2. Excessive Issuance of Currency. Prior to this round of  inflation, the amount of currency issued in 1992 was increased  by 115.9 billion yuan as compared with that in 1991. Because of  the multiplicative effect, the issuance of 115.9 billion yuan  basic currency is equivalent to derivative loans of 200 to 250  billion yuan. The additional currency issued in 1992 not only  helped awaken the enthusiasm in production and consumption,  which was dampened by the campaign for improvement and  rectification of the economic order, but also pushed the 1993  commodity price to a high rate of 13 percent. Thus, the 1993  policy of putting more money into circulation in support of high  economic growth (50 percent higher than that in 1992) will  definitely impose a burden on the economy in 1994. Excessive  currency issuance accounted for 5.5 percent of the total blame  for the inflation in 1993. It is estimated that this figure may  exceed 7 percent this year.    3. Rising Cost of Social Labor. In order to arouse the  enthusiasm of workers, enterprises that are making good profits  often increase workers' wages and bonuses. The total amount of  wages for workers in 1993 grew approximately 20 percent over  1992. Those local governments with more money also increase  subsidies to their administrative personnel. The plan to  readjust salaries of government employees announced in October  last year had given pay raises to all members of the civil  service. Due to the rigid nature of the wage system, it has  objectively raised the cost of social labor and become a major  factor in pushing the price up.    4. Restraints by "Bottleneck" Effect and Resources. These  two  types of restraints have always been hampering economic  development. If the rate of economic growth is maintained at  approximately 10 percent, the effect of the two types of  restraints will be felt even more distinctively. It will make  the price of relevant products to sharply increase.    5. Rapid Investment Growth. Over a protracted period of  time,  the rapid growth in demand for investment is the major factor in  China's economic growth. However, the year of high investment  often means a year of high prices. The main reason is that price  increases are caused by increasing investment and by the  imbalance between supply and demand due to irrational investment  structure or poor investment performance.  <H5>  Government Is Determined To Tame "Wild Horse of Inflation" </H5>   Due to lack of information and other reasons, the general  public in China often fails to foresee an inflationary trend.  However, the high commodity price for two years running has  exerted great pressure on the residents psychologically. For the  first two months in 1994, the retail price for consumer goods on  the domestic market was up 25.9 percent over that in 1993.  People are on the verge of panic buying. The issue of commodity  price becomes the focus of deputies' conversation at the "two  sessions" and arouses the close attention of the government  leaders. At the group meeting with the Beijing deputy group of  the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress held  on 12 March, Premier Li Peng said that it is necessary to  exercise the macro-control in the course of decontrolling price.  At the group meeting with the Hunan deputy group on the same  day, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji emphatically pointed out that in  order to keep down prices, the CPC Central Committee and State  Council decided to adopt the following four measures: 1) Efforts  should be made to control the size of investment in fixed assets  and that of consumer spending. 2) The governments at all levels  must pay full attention to agriculture and the "shopping basket"  project. 3) The government must strengthen the macro-control  over market price. 4) In the very near future, a series of  economic measures will be taken to keep down prices. Prior to  and after the two sessions, the State Council in late March  decided to conduct a major checkup of commodity price. This  checkup is expected to last three months. It also instructed the  State Planning Commission to work in coordination with the  supervisory, financial, taxation, auditing, and technical  control departments as well as the industrial and commercial  administration to form work teams to go to various provinces,  autonomous regions and municipalities under the direct  administration of the government to help carry out the work of  price checkup. Some local governments have also worked out rules  and regulations to prevent people from making sudden huge  profits in order to keep down prices. All these measures were  highly praised by economists and ordinary residents. They  appreciate the efforts made by the government in quickly  tackling the issue of inflation which is menacing the rapidly  developing economy. At the same time, an official of the  Ministry of Labor stressed that the state has officially  promulgated the "Regulations on Minimum Wage in Enterprises"  aimed at ensuring that each worker will earn at least the  minimum wage with which he can meet the basic needs in  livelihood for himself and his family members. The official also  asked various localities to make wage adjustments from time to  time according to the living expense index.  <H5>  Taking Part in Investment, You May Run Faster Than a Wide </H5> Horse    Whether you are willing to do so or not, you will feel an  impulse to make investment and like to increase your credit, as  long as China maintains a high rate of economic growth. This  kind of economic growth on the basis of credit will make you  live with inflation.    For most of the wage earners, no one is living like Fang  Shunping any more. Right now, the total amount of savings  deposits in rural and urban areas has reached 1.65 trillion  yuan. If we count the cash in residents' hands, the social  capital in China has reached 2 trillion yuan. Economists pointed  out that we must make all kinds of investments in order to  preserve and increase the value of the money while living in an  inflationary environment.    During the 1980's, people in China only have two totally  different markets. One is the market of consumer goods for basic  subsistence, while the other is one for expensive high-quality  merchandise. In recent years, stocks, bonds, fund-raising  associations, real estate agencies and rural foundations of a  shareholding and cooperative nature have emerged. In face of all  types of investment programs with higher investment returns,  more and more urban residents want to make money not only for  filling their shopping baskets, but they also for buying houses,  investing in stock and taking part in other investment programs.  Signs have indicated that more and more people are investing  money in China's capital market. The main participants of the  capital market will be the 200 million urban population and the  30 percent of the rural population -- peasants who are capable  of extending reproduction. The growth of this major group of  investors means that the state-run economic sector may gradually  let the nongovernment economic sector to share the market.  Meanwhile, it is precisely because of the nongovernment  financing market which has attracted a huge amount of currency  on the market that the "wide horse of inflation" was reined in  to a certain extent and a runaway inflation of more than 30  percent as predicted by some economists did not appear.    At a time when individual investments aimed at withstanding  inflation and achieving social diversity have gradually become  the common choice of hundreds of millions of people, various  strategies and tactics for investment are being offered to all  those who are interested in making investments. If you want to  invest in stock, you must understand the company which floats  the stock, and read reports on its financial situation. If you  buy and sell bonds, you must know how to calculate the earning  rate. If you handle transactions in futures, you must pay  attention to the price of rice and cotton at home and abroad and  even the situation concerning ocean freight as well as the  weather conditions and political situation in various countries.  If you buy and sell foreign exchange, you must be able to  predict the changes of economic policies of the major countries,  and understand the rules and regulations governing the  international foreign exchange market. If you make investment in  real estate, you should at least take into consideration the  prospect and the potential value of the estate in that area...  [JIDIAN RIBAO ellipsis]    After securities were officially issued for the first time  in Shanghai in January 1985 and in Shenzhen in May 1987, four  shareholding enterprises in Beijing also openly floated 175  million shares of stock on the market at the end of March 1994.  Stock which was once regarded as "torrential flood and wild  beast" withstood the test of the reform program and is now  available to the general public after nine years in one locality  and seven years in another. This is something of great symbolic  meaning on Mainland China. At a time when ordinary people in  China, who had little sense of investment and never dreamed  about becoming rich before are allowed to pursue capital gains  with open arms, why should you hold your cash tight and worry  about the plus or minus few percent of the inflation rate?</p>

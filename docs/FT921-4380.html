			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Appointments: Len Peach for police quango Sir Leonard Peach is to become chairman of the Police Complaints Authority in August when the current chairman, Judge Francis Petre, retires. Sir Leonard spent most of his working life at IBM (UK) where he specialised in personnel management. In 1985, he was seconded to the DHSS as the first director of personnel of the new NHS Management Board after the introduction of general management in the health service. When the first chief executive, Victor Paige, resigned after falling out with his political masters, Sir Leonard moved into the top job. He was responsible for introducing the management performance reviews and individual performance pay for NHS managers. His three-year secondment to the health service ended in January 1989, shortly before the introduction of the controversial NHS reforms. Sir Leonard returned to IBM as director of personnel and corporate affairs, a post from which he is soon to retire. He was president of the Institute of Personnel Management between 1983 and 1985.</p>

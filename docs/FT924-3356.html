			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Second line stocks take the lead SECOND line stocks continued to make good progress in London yesterday but early gains in the blue chip names were reversed towards the close by a rout in the stock index futures sector. Once again, however, traders stressed that selling pressure was modest, and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index strongly outperformed the FT-SE 100. The first half of the trading session went well, with the market leaders moving ahead, encouraged first by further firmness in sterling and then by favourable October statistics on UK consumer credit. A firm pound is regarded as underpinning hopes for a further cut in base rates, probably just after Christmas, and also suggests overseas investment in UK securities. The Pounds 76m increase in net credit to consumers in October provided support for belief that some areas of the domestic economy have begun to show signs of recovery. However, the stock market, having already discounted some pick-up in economic activity since Britain's departure from the European monetary system, remained inclined towards caution. Nevertheless, the Footsie gained 16.6 to 2,776 before topping out smartly at mid-session. Share prices then hung fire for a while, with turnover fading away. The crunch came when the premium on the December FT-SE Index futures contract suddenly contracted. Share prices reacted sharply and the market fell by 24 points to show a net loss of 7.6 on the Footsie. A modest rally at the close, also sparked from the stock index futures market, left the FT-SE Index at 2,754.5 for a net loss of 4.9. But FT-SE Mid 250 Index, in contrast to the Footsie which is made up of 100 leading stocks, had a firm session throughout, closing with a gain of 13.1 at 2,674.3. Trading volume was reduced, bringing the day's Seaq-reported total down to 426.6m shares from Friday's 676.1m. But, as indicated by the FT-SE Mid 250 Index performance, turnover in the second line issues well outstripped that in the Seaq listed stocks. Moreover, the value of retail, or customer, business rose on Friday to Pounds 1.53bn, one of the best daily totals of recent weeks and extending the prolonged run of relatively profitable trading for the London-based securities industry. Little heed was paid to an opening gain of 10 Dow points in New York, although there were reports of selective buying of London equities from across the Atlantic. The market was held back by selling of a handful of blue chip issues, notably ICI which attracted adverse review from the brokerage community. Retail and stores issues lacked supporters, in spite of the favourable consumer credit news. Some leisure and hotel issues, however, found encouragement from the terms of the long-expected sale by Forte of its Gardner Merchant catering division. Market strategists remained optimistic, taking the view that the market's surge towards new territory has been well underpinned by last week's signs of recovery in the US economy and by the boost to the UK's competitiveness provided by the prolonged fall in sterling. However, some believe that the market could react should the next base rate cut be long delayed, - even if German rates are shaved this week.</p>

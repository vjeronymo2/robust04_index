Brigadier General Fred Chijuka, who stated this, said Nigeria  was not an aggressor. The country only carried out a routine  relocation of troops on its eastern border, a measure that was  not designed to embarrass any of its neighbors. He said that if  there was any misunderstanding between Nigeria and Cameroon, the  issue was already being resolved at the diplomatic level. The  troops' relocation, according to him, was normal and aimed at  enhancing the safety of its citizens.    The Nigerian foreign minister, Mr. Babagana Kingibe, visited  Cameroon last week on the border issue after which both  countries agreed on a joint patrol to stem the clashes.</p>

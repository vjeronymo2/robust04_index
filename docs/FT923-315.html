			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / International Company News: Clabecq to restructure FORGES de Clabecq, the Belgian steel group, plans a restructuring exercise, having failed to reach agreement in its partnership talks with Usinor-Sacilor, the French steel company, Reuter reports. Clabecq, which ran up higher losses for last year, said the board approved the restructuring measures as 'absolutely indispensable' provided they could be implemented without delay. But the board added it was necessary to make a further study of certain facts on which the plan was based. Clabecq said its financial situation would not improve without the measures it planned to take. For the year to end-June, Clabecq made a net loss of BFr1.9bn (Dollars 62m), up from BFr836m in the previous 12 months. The company said the performance was due to lower productivity in the first-half and weak global steel prices. Clabecq said stoppages for modernisation and upgrading at its blast furnace hit production during the first half of the year. But the situation improved slightly during the second half with prices rising.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (1): Global trends, national traits - While the industry is putting recession behind it, some countries are still languishing When British business travellers step onto an aircraft, they leave behind hordes of envious friends and colleagues. Friends and colleagues of German business travellers, on the other hand, are more likely to pity than envy them. These are some of the findings of a recent survey into the attitudes and experiences of business travellers in 10 European countries carried out in June by Visa International, the payments group. The differences between travellers from the 10 countries are the most striking features of the survey (see charts, pages 2, 8 and 16). Sixty per cent of Dutch business travellers feel lonely when they travel; only 36 per cent of Spaniards do. Only 29 per cent of Dutch travellers enjoy staying at hotels, compared with 56 per cent of Greeks. Yet this year has seen three large takeovers in the travel industry, all based on the idea that business travel is now global and that travel agents need to be able to service clients in the same way, whether they live in Caracas or Kuala Lumpur. In March, Wagonlit of France announced it was combining its business travel interests with those of Carlson of the US to create a network with combined revenues of Dollars 10.8bn, operating from 4,000 locations in 125 countries. The new company, Carlson Wagonlit Travel, said it wanted to 'service the growing needs of the global business traveller'. Last month, American Express paid Dollars 375m to buy the business travel operations of Thomas Cook outside the US and all the company's interests in the US. Thomas Cook's reason for leaving the business travel industry had a familiar ring: it did not have sufficient international representation to cater for the global needs of the business traveller. In particular, Thomas Cook's US business had to be operated by a franchisee. This was because Thomas Cook is owned by Westdeutsche Landesbank and US banking legislation prevented it from operating an American travel business itself. Both groups claim that the process of integrating two companies is going well. Travel industry insiders, however, believe the American Express/Thomas Cook grouping has a betterchance of success than Carlson Wagonlit. Their first reason is that American Express has taken over Thomas Cook rather than setting up a joint venture with it. There is no doubt about who will be in charge. Although Thomas Cook is German-owned, it began in the UK over 150 years ago and shares an English-speaking background with American Express. The two companies have both competed and co-operated over the years. When American Express began producing traveller's cheques in 1891, Thomas Cook helped to ensure the new product's success by agreeing to accept it in its 150 offices throughout the world. Carlson Wagonlit is a joint venture rather than a takeover, which means that two parties, rather than one, will have to agree its future strategy. The two companies are also markedly different from one another: Carlson is a privately-owned US group, while Wagonlit is part of Accor, the French hotel and catering concern. Another takeover aimed at winning business from the international traveller was the acquisition last month by Forte, the UK hotel and restaurants group, of Meridien, the international hotel chain controlled by Air France. The takeover should turn Forte from a largely British group into an international chain, ready to compete with the likes of Hilton International, Sheraton and Inter-Continental. Once again, one of Forte's main reasons for making the acquisition was that international travellers often use the same hotel chain wherever they are in the world. But does this global traveller really exist? If the Visa International survey - which was carried out among 2,000 readers of Executive Travel and International Management magazines - reveals substantial differences among European travellers, there are surely even greater disparities when US and Asian travellers are considered, too. Even international hoteliers admit that most of their customers are not global travellers. Mr Tommaso Zanzotto, chief executive of Hilton International, says that at his company's eight properties in Germany, 80 per cent of the guests are German. At Hilton International's four hotels in Japan, between 85 per cent and 88 per cent of customers are Japanese. Mr Gavin Simonds, joint managing director of Inter-Continental hotels, says that travel within regions, such as the Asia-Pacific area, is a more common feature of contemporary business travel than trips across the world. Nevertheless, Mr Simonds insists hotel chains with international brand names still have an important role. While only 10 per cent to 15 per cent of guests in a typical five-star hotel might have made an inter-continental journey to get there, a chain without an internationally recognised name would find it hard to win their custom. Mr Simonds says: 'There are various tiers in the travel market and the global travellers are at the top. We can address that market where others can't. But if you just address that market, you will fail. You have to look after the regional and the local market as well. If you forget those, you do so at your peril.' Mr Eric Brannan, senior European vice president of American Express business travel operations, insists, however, that his clients around the world do have similar needs. 'They all get into a taxi, they all get onto an aeroplane, they all sleep in hotel beds,' he says. While this is certainly true, the Visa International survey shows that travellers disagree about what sort of hotels they should stay in. While 75 per cent of Greek respondents to the survey agreed that 'business travellers deserve the luxuries of top class travel', only 44 per cent of Italians and 45 per cent of French travellers agreed. While 41 per cent of British travellers thought it was very important to have a prompt laundry service in a hotel, only 17 per cent of Spaniards regarded it as very important. Asked how important it was to have a television set in their hotel room, 53 per cent of Greeks thought it was very important, but only 28 per cent of Belgians. It is true that the Visa International survey also showed areas of similarity between business travellers from the 10 European countries. The vast majority, for example, believe that business travel will continue to be necessary. Over 90 per cent of British and Danish business travellers agreed with the proposition: 'One-to-one meetings are invaluable, so business travel is here to stay'. The country whose travellers expressed the most scepticism about this statement was Italy, but even there 72 per cent thought business travel was here to stay. The business travel industry says there are certainly signs that their business is now beginning to put the North American and European recession behind it. Mr Zanzotto says business travel in both the US and Canada has picked up since the end of last year. The UK is also improving, with business in London particularly strong. The south-east Asian economies are performing well, he says. Even Australia, which was particularly badly hit by the downturn is improving, although Sydney still has too many hotel rooms. Business travel is still languishing in some countries, however. They include Japan, Germany, France and the Benelux countries, he says. The Visa International survey appears to show that although business travel might be reviving, business travellers have little taste for the luxuries of the 1980s or many of the perks that some hotel chains still seem intent on providing. Few European business travellers see the need for a limousine service to pick them up from the airport. In all cases, only 10 per cent or fewer travellers thought this was a very important service. In Norway, no business traveller thought it was very important. So too with fitness centres, regarded by upmarket hoteliers as an essential offering. The proportion of travellers who said fitness centres were very important to them did not exceed 23 per cent in any European country.</p>

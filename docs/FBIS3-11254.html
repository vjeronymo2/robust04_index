Yesterday, Carlos Gonzalez Ramirez, Panamanian ambassador to  the GATT Secretariat said Panama has proposed two dates in March  to begin meetings that will open the way for the nation's entry  into GATT. The dates were accepted by all member-nations except  the EU.    Gonzalez Ramirez said the EU's decision has delayed Panama's  admittance into GATT, adding that the EU position is "greatly"  coincidential, considering Panama maintains a decisive position  in Latin American's struggle against some European countries'  decision to establish controls on banana imports from the region.    He said: "This may or may not be the case. We will have to  wait a few days and see what this is all about."    EU members say they thought Panama wanted to begin the GATT  meetings in May, adding that it would be difficult to hold the  meetings before that time because the Europeans will be very  busy finalizing the Uruguay Round agreements.    Panama is expected to negotiate standards issues with all  member- nations at the first meeting, and it will discuss  bilateral tariff agreements at the second meeting.    Gonzalez Ramirez said the EU's decision represents a one and  one- half month delay in Panama's plans for admittance into  GATT. He added that the nation's entry into GATT could be  further aggravated by the need to present a report on the  results of its GATT negotiations to the National Assembly before  15 April 1995. He also said the GATT Secretariat headquartered  in Geneva, Switzerland, believes the meeting could be held on 19  or 20 March, although Panama would prefer to meet before that  date.</p>

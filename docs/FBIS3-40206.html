			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Qin Jingwu [4440 0079 0582]] </F>   [Text] The Chinese electric power industry completed its  annual mission for the installation of new power capacity nine  days ahead of schedule, and kept the annual capacity of newly  installed large- and medium-sized units above 12,000 MW for the  sixth straight year, maintaining the fastest pace of electric  power development in the world.    The total national power output for the year was 815 billion  kWh, 9.44 percent over last year, of which 671 billion kWh was  from thermal power, an increase of 9.16 percent, and hydropower  was 144 billion kWh, a 10.77 percent increase over last year.  The entire electric power industry earned 19.9 billion yuan in  profit taxes, an increase of 15.4 percent over the previous year.    Although China's power industry has grown rapidly, the  national economy has grown even faster and the power supply is  more than 20 percent short of needs. In order to put electric  power ahead of the curve, the Ministry of Electric Power is  planning to add 15,000 MW of new units annually from 1995 to  1997, and 20,000 MW annually from 1998 to 2000, which will be an  increase of about 300,000 MW of installed capacity by the end of  the century, and will basically meet China's domestic needs. The  government will make a great effort to raise the money for this,  and will encourage joint efforts among administrative areas to  get electric power and develop hydropower resources, and will  encourage coastal economic development zones to make even  greater investments into energy bases to get power, and for  sending power out of energy rich areas; Economically developed  areas will be encouraged to raise funds for power, and power  enterprises will be allowed to go directly to the banks and  other financial institutions for loans, or to issue bonds and  shares.</p>

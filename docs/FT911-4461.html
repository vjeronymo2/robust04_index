			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Letter: Firm conclusion Sir, You report Nicholas Brady as saying that the US 'cannot be asked to negotiate the same issue twice - once with the EC as a whole and then again with the individual member states' ('New bank offers City central role in Europe', April 16). One can but agree. By the principle of subsidiarity, once the US has successfully concluded negotiations with the EC, they should be just that: concluded. A. G. R. van Terheyden, 59 Sutherland Chase, Ascot, Berkshire</p>

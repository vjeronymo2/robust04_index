			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Usborne achieves Pounds 1.6m USBORNE, a diversified group with core interests in grain merchanting and pig production, yesterday announced a return to profit with Pounds 1.6m pre-tax for the 18 months to June 30 - in line with the forecast which accompanied August's Pounds 4.6m rights issue. The shares rose 2p to 22 1/2 p. The outcome, which compared with losses of Pounds 4.12m for the 1991 year, was enhanced by a pension fund surplus of Pounds 721,000 and a sharp fall in the company's share of associates' losses of Pounds 196,000 (Pounds 4.38m). Operating profit from continuing operations was Pounds 3.54m (Pounds 1.27m) on turnover of Pounds 311m (Pounds 210m). Mr David Frame, chief executive, said the two main events of the year - the rights issue and the purchase from Unigate of a substantial portion of its outdoor reared pigs - both made a substantial difference to the balance sheet and provided 'important opportunities for the development of our two principal businesses.' He said that the grain merchanting side had performed well in a declining market for cereals. Grain showed a profit of Pounds 2.9m (Pounds 1.5m) on turnover of Pounds 269m (Pounds 186m). On the pig side the Unigate arrangement would lead to more stable long-term supplies and Mr Frame said the group had made strides towards creating a business which would produce steady profits over the next five years. The division showed a profit of Pounds 611,000 (Pounds 69,000) on turnover of Pounds 37m (Pounds 20m). The proposed final dividend is 0.4p, making a total of 0.8p (0.4p), payable from earnings of 2.19p per share (losses of 5.79p).</p>

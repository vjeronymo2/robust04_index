			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: Renault, Volvo ventures strengthen cars alliance RENAULT, the French state-owned carmaker, and Volvo, its Swedish partner, are to strengthen their alliance by pooling most of their car component purchasing and all their quality control activities. The companies have agreed to set up two joint ventures in component-buying and quality control to 'put together the respective resources of Renault and Volvo Car Corporation so as to act as if the two groups were one company,' the French company said. This is one of the biggest steps in the Renault-Volvo alliance since the pair agreed to take cross-shareholdings in each others' parents and subsidiaries two years ago. But it was not a prelude to a full merger of the groups' car and truckmaking businesses, added Renault. Shortly before retiring last month, Mr Raymond Levy, the former chairman, said a merger was possible, but such a course was not the only way to increase co-operation with Volvo. The components move will boost the economies of scale already achieved by helping the partners to secure bigger discounts from suppliers. They now jointly buy 15 per cent of their components from common makers through a committee set up in October 1990. The companies hoped to lift that figure to 80 per cent very shortly, said Renault. Renault spends FFr50bn (Dollars 9.46bn) a year on buying components, representing 60 per cent of its manufacturing costs. Volvo's components bill stands at FFr14bn. If the two reached their 80 per cent target, they would pool FFr51.2bn of annual spending. Before yesterday's announcement, Volvo estimated that in two to five years it would save SKr800m (Dollars 141.6m) annually from joint component buying alone. Renault has not put a figure to its savings in this area, but estimates it has saved FFr1bn on development costs by using some Volvo engines. The joint venture on quality control aims to ensure the partners use common methods and standards. It applies to the manufacturing process as well as to finished cars. Along with the components venture, it builds on existing co-operation - a joint quality management board set up last September. Both operations will be based in Paris under management to be chosen on merit from either partner. They will be set up as European economic interest groupings, a streamlined structure set up under EC law to encourage cross-frontier alliances. Neither of the joint activities would apply to the partners' truckmaking divisions, which have fewer suppliers in common, said Renault. To date, the partners have created a joint research centre in France; partially merged their sales divisions for French cars and light commercial vehicles; and co-operated in the production of two buses.</p>

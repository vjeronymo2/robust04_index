			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia -- Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero will  discuss with the economic team the proposal to freeze credit for  the first three months after the implementation of the new  currency, the real, as former Minister Mario Henrique Simonsen  suggested to Minister Ricupero on Sunday 24 April.    The economic team has been working with several ideas  involving the curtailing of credit immediately after the  implementation of the real. They are concerned, however, about  the need to prevent people from creating a consumption  escalation as a result of a sudden drop in the inflation rate,  because that would cause prices in the new currency to increase.  The dilemma now is to figure out the population's demand for  currency.    Once the economy is stabilized, there will be a  remonetization phenomenon, that is, the exchange of money  invested in certificates for currency. No one knows the volume  of certificates that will be converted into money. All everyone  knows is that if demand and supply are big, there will be strong  inflationary pressure on the recently created currency. Gustavo  Franco, director of the Central Bank International Area, has  already warned that the monetary base (currency in the hands of  the public plus bank reserves) will not double. In February,  the monetary base totalled 0.6 percent of the GDP. This is  equivalent to $2.5 billion.    Franco added that there will be a significantly tight money  supply. It must be recalled that the market has invested nearly  $100 billion in the banks. This money crutch will be enough to  ensure that only a small portion ends in the pockets of the  people.    To give an idea of the amount of money invested in the  banks,  it must be said that more than $20 billion were invested in the  savings pass books in February. The money invested in private  certificates totals $30 billion.    Before defining the money crutch model to be adopted, the  team wants to ensure budget balance because without this, it  will be useless to control credit. The objective is to prevent  the government from issuing money to finance common expenditures  of the public machinery and then issue certificates to collect  this money, thus creating sources for price increases.</p>

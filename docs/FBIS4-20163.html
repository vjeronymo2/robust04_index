			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Tragedy in Gorazde"] </F>   [Text] To abandon Gorazde and deliver the city's Muslim  inhabitants to the mercy of the Bosnian Serbs is a moral,  political, and military tragedy for which Europe will pay a very  high price. So it is, and so it will be, and it is no use  packaging this fact in realpolitik explanations. The nightmare  in Gorazde and the humanitarian catastrophe now under way will  haunt us far into the future.    The responsibility for things having come this far rests, as  far as the latest phases of the procession of events, not least  on Russia. As the traditional ally of the Serbs, the Russians  insisted on playing a quite important role in solving the  Yugoslav conflict, only to find out what has long been clear to  all others, namely that the Bosnian Serbs are not to be counted  upon. In the process of coming to this realization, Moscow  protested so loudly about NATO's two bomb attacks that this was  understood by the Serbs, correctly, as it turned out, as a  signal that their advance could continue without risk of a  tougher international course of action. From the United States  have come very contradictory statements as the situation at the  front has become worse and worse. First the government in  Washington denied that air attacks were being contemplated in  the discussions, then these were employed to a very limited  extent, and then -- when they were not as effective as intended  -- the United States failed to follow them up militarily, and  instead offered new diplomatic initiatives. The European Union  has confined itself to a still more threadbare declaration about  increasing diplomatic pressure on the attacking Serbs.    The result is that the UN's credibility has received a  deathblow, since it has been seen that the resolution that  designated Gorazde and other Muslim enclaves as safe areas that  cannot be overrun militarily has proven completely worthless.  The line that was drawn in the sand could thus still be crossed.  This is obviously first of all an expression of a growing  cynicism from the Serbian side, but it is also a striking defeat  for the world as a whole. To both present as well as potential  despots everywhere a signal has been sent that the international  community can be reduced to a paper tiger as long as sufficient  determination is shown. What now? A minimum requirement must be  that the UN's authorization be expanded so that there is no  doubt about the international will to protect the other safe  areas, including Tuzla, where Danish tanks are deployed. In this  connection, happily, Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen  yesterday on behalf of Denmark backed the demand for an expanded  mandate. It is apparently too late to save Gorazde from a  horrible fate, but the humiliation ought to be used to ensure  that no repetitions occur.</p>

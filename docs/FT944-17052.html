			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Russian help for Armenia Russia has pledged Rbs110bn in aid credits to Armenia, more than half of which will be used for reactivating a nuclear power station, Russian news agencies reported yesterday. Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, speaker of the Russian parliament's upper house, announced the aid offer during an official visit to the former Soviet republic. He said Armenia needed the power station to combat 'the acute shortage of electricity' which had hampered Armenia's industrial and economic development. Falling output, soaring prices and an economic blockade imposed by neighbouring Azerbaijan have pushed Armenia's living standards to among the lowest of all former Soviet republics.</p>

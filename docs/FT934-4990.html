			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Ferruzzi investors approve share issues Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), the debt-ridden Italian holding company, took an important step towards its financial restructuring yesterday after shareholders in Milan approved an ambitious recapitalisation. The go-ahead for the scheme, prepared by a group of leading Italian bank creditors led by Mediobanca, means Ferfin will launch a string of share issues to raise cash. As the deals are largely guaranteed by bank creditors, the main effect will be to convert part of the debt into equity. Shareholders approved the plan to raise L2,932bn (Pounds 1.1bn) through rights issues and warrants to buy new shares. Moreover, the company also received the green light to issue a further nominal L2,000bn in new shares and L800bn in bonds over the next 18 months. A similar plan is to be put to shareholders of Montedison, Ferfin's main industrial subsidiary, today. Ferfin's shareholders also approved a proposal by the board to take legal action against Price Waterhouse, the group's former accountants. Ferfin's new management, imposed by leading bank creditors earlier this year, says the auditors failed to discover irregularities in the group's accounts which allegedly arose under the previous management. In spite of the recapitalisation, the Ferruzzi group faces another difficult year, according to Mr Guido Rossi, Ferfin's chairman. He told shareholders that the group's Montecatini chemicals subsidiary would lose about L1,150bn in 1993. About L650bn of the loss would stem from financing costs. Mr Rossi said banks representing almost 87 per cent of Ferfin's borrowings had agreed to the restructuring plan by Monday's deadline. However, a number of big foreign banks remain opposed to the proposal and are working on a counter scheme. Mr Rossi said negotiations between Montecatini and Shell on an ambitious joint venture to pool polyethelene activities were proceeding. The long awaited deal, code-named 'Project Sophia', has been under discussion for over a year. However, he gave no indication when a deal might be signed. Banca Commerciale Italiana, the big Italian bank due to be privatised early next year, said pre-tax profits in the first nine months of this year soared to L585.3bn compared with L267.6bn in the same period in 1992. Gross operating profits rose by 56.3 per cent to L1,363bn from L859bn. The increase was due to a virtual doubling of fee-related income to L1,373bn from L755bn.</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / International Company News: Pacific Dunlop sells Eastman stake to US PACIFIC Dunlop, the Australian industrial group, has settled the sale of Eastman, the US stationery and furniture group, for USDollars 142m. Eastman, formerly a joint venture between Pacific Dunlop and David Jones, the Australian retailer, has been purchased by McCown DeLeeuw, a US venture banking company. Pacific Dunlop acquired its interest in Eastman through the takeover of Petersville Sleigh, the Australian food group, in August last year. Initial plans to float Eastman for USDollars 215m, were abandoned. The sale is the latest in a string of disposals of Petersville assets by Pacific Dunlop. Directors said the Eastman sale price had allowed Pacific Dunlop to recoup the book value of its investment. Mayne Nickless, the transport group, has confirmed plans to acquire France Distribution System, the Paris-based warehousing and distribution company. Mayne Nickless said FDS was France's leading company in the warehousing and distribution of dry grocery products, with annual sales of about ADollars 167m (USDollars 115.7m). The acquisition, from Scac-Delmas-Vieljeux, a private French company, is subject to French Treasury approval. The Australian government has approved the bitterly-contested bid by Campbell Soup, the US food group, for Arnotts, the Australian biscuit company, subject to a number of conditions. Mr John Dawkins, federal treasurer, surprised the stockmarkets by announcing the approval yesterday. Analysts had expected the bid, at ADollars 8.80 a share and valuing Arnotts at ADollars 1.2bn, to be frozen for 90 days. Mr Dawkins' conditions on the bid include that Arnotts must remain listed in Australia, the majority of its directors would be Australian and its operations remained based in Australia. Arnotts shares dipped to Dollars A8.80 yesterday.</p>

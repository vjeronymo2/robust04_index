The first Russian support centre for small businesses will open in Moscow in September with the help of finance provided by Britain's Know How Fund, Mr Michael Howard, the employment minister, said. In a further move to help eastern European countries develop more enterprising economies, the government has invited the employment ministers from 11 countries to a two-day conference on February 24-25 entitled Job Creation and Small Firms Development. The conference will look at the political, cultural and practical problems of establishing an enterprise culture and promoting the growth of small firms. Among countries expected to attend are Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and the three Baltic states. The International Labour Organisation and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will also send delegates. Twenty managers from small and medium-sized businesses in St Petersburg arrive at Manchester Business School today at the start of a four-week management development programme. They come from businesses involved in boat building, hotel construction, fashion knitwear and computer science.</p>

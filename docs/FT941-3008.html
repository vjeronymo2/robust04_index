			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Egyptian army officers executed Egypt executed two army officers yesterday for plotting to kill President Hosni Mubarak and sentenced nine Moslem militants to hang for trying to kill Prime Minister Atef Sedki, Reuter reports from Cairo. The militants, held in cages in the court, exploded with rage at their sentences, chanting: 'We will go to paradise, Mubarak, and you will burn in hell. We will kill you. Death is coming to you, Mubarak.' An army firing squad in Alexandria executed the two army officers. They were convicted in a secret trial last month for planting explosives at an airstrip near the Libyan border which was to be used by Mr Mubarak. A third officer sentenced to death is on the run. The three have been hailed as heroes by Gama'a al-Islamiya, which is fighting to replace the Egyptian government with a strict Islamic state. Infiltration of the armed forces by Moslem militants is one of the Egyptian government's worst nightmares. It was such a group, led by army Lt Khaled al-Islambouli, which murdered President Anwar Sadat at a military parade in 1981.</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / MMM chief poaches deputies Mr Sergei Mavrodi, the head of the controversial MMM investment fund, has begun to set up his own parliamentary faction by attracting members from the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) of ultranationalist Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky while he is touring the US. Mr Mavrodi, who won a parliamentary by-election on October 30, and Mr Alexei Mitrofanov, deputy LDP leader, want to create a new faction to push for legislation to counter the 'arbitrariness' of government. To be recognised by the state duma, or lower house of parliament, the new group will need to recruit at least 35 deputies. Mr Mitrofanov, the foreign minister in Mr Zhirinovsky's shadow cabinet, said the new group, People's Capital, had signed up 16 deputies, most of them from the LDP. The new faction probably will be led by Mr Mavrodi, who spent several months in jail and is under investigation for tax evasion.</p>
